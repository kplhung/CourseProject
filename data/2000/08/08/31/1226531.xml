        <p>THE KNOX BROTHERS  By Penelope Fitzgerald  288 pages. Counterpoint. $26.</p>
        <p>The birth of a writer is a mystery; occurring as it does well past the womb and in plain sight, and all the more hidden because of it. Few writer births can have been more mysterious than that of the late Penelope Fitzgerald, one of the most remarkable British novelists of the last half-century.</p>
        <p>She was only a couple of years shy of 60 when she began to write, after a near-lifetime that began in a degree of privilege and descended into a maelstrom of penury, marriage to a shiftless alcoholic, the struggle to support her family and a series of erratic house moves. One was to a houseboat that sank with virtually all her possessions: most important, her photographs, letters, notes and journals.</p>

        <p>THE KNOX BROTHERS  By Penelope Fitzgerald  288 pages. Counterpoint. $26.</p>
        <p>The birth of a writer is a mystery; occurring as it does well past the womb and in plain sight, and all the more hidden because of it. Few writer births can have been more mysterious than that of the late Penelope Fitzgerald, one of the most remarkable British novelists of the last half-century.</p>
        <p>She was only a couple of years shy of 60 when she began to write, after a near-lifetime that began in a degree of privilege and descended into a maelstrom of penury, marriage to a shiftless alcoholic, the struggle to support her family and a series of erratic house moves. One was to a houseboat that sank with virtually all her possessions: most important, her photographs, letters, notes and journals.</p>
        <p>It is tempting to date the writer's conception right here, though birth would occur 10 years later. With all you have been, or thought someday to become, sunk beneath the Thames, your only salvager is the typewriter and the mind that waited so long to use it.</p>
        <p>Fitzgerald's first two books were a thriller written to amuse her dying husband and a life of the pre-Raphaelite painter Edward Burne-Jones. Almost at the same time she completed a biography of her father and his three brothers: remarkable men all, in idiosyncratic ways.</p>
        <p>These books were a fluttering of wings for the aged domestic duckling, soon to swan out in eight novels written over the next 20 years and culminating in four masterpieces: ''Innocence,'' ''The Beginning of Spring,'' ''Gate of Angels'' and ''The Blue Flower.'' Set respectively in Italy, pre-Revolution Russia, Cambridge University at the start of the 20th century, and 19th-century Germany, their quirky beguilement is the float zigzagging as a murky form lips the fish hook 10 feet down.</p>
        <p>Fitzgerald died last spring at 83, leaving a group of short stories that will come out in the fall. Meanwhile a new edition of the family biography, ''The Knox Brothers,'' has been published by Counterpoint, partly revised by the author in collaboration with her longtime American editor, Christopher Carduff. The original version appeared in the United States a quarter-century ago, well before the novels that would gradually win attention. It sold only a few thousand copies and received little notice.</p>
        <p>It is well worth notice; both for itself and for the light it casts on an author's evolution -- particularly such a late evolution -- into what she would become. In its own right ''The Knox Brothers'' is a lively account of two generations of a remarkable English family straddling the divide between late Victorian and Edwardian. Edmund Knox, Fitzgerald's grandfather, was a staunch Church of England clergyman, a Low Church doctrinal conservative with a social conscience that led him to resign the rural parish where his children blissfully grew up for a gritty slum outside Birmingham. His energy and devotion led to eventual elevation as Bishop of Manchester. Fitzgerald portrays a man whose stern rectitude was joined to the conviction that fun was essential and that children should be very happy (the late in late Victorian: think Lewis Carroll). By and large his were.</p>
        <p>Happiness, at least, was their inheritance; so was intellectual ardor, combativeness and a moral energy that propelled them onto the world at eccentric, sometimes painful angles. Edmund Knox (nicknamed Evoe), Fitzgerald's father, was a journalist who rose to be the editor of Punch, a post well paid and refulgent. Its incumbent was known, part seriously, as King of Fleet Street.</p>
        <p>Dillwyn, known as Dilly, was a Cambridge Greek scholar co-opted from his lifelong passion into an almost lifelong post as cryptographer for the intelligence services, at first in the famously cryptic Room 40 and in World War II at Bletchley Park. There he played an important role (Fitzgerald tries but fails quite to explain it) in cracking the Nazi's Enigma codes. The two brothers were unbelievers, mild and truculent respectively, thus putting them at odds with the bishop. And also with their younger brothers, Wilfred and Ronald, Anglican clergymen both, until Ronald converted and became a celebrated Roman Catholic priest, apologist and translator of a Catholic Bible. That put them at odds with one another as well; and in the case of Ronald, with their father, who cut him out of his will.</p>
        <p>It was a family of perpetual intransigent argument. Yet Fitzgerald persuasively maintains it was a matter of the bonds beneath the odds. ''When I was very young I took my uncles for granted, and it never occurred to me that everyone else in the world was not like them,'' she writes. Like platypuses bickering, the Knoxes were more different from the world than from one another.</p>
        <p>The anecdotes are wonderful. They illuminate Evoe, kind, witty and diffident, as if success were something of a blemish; Dilly, prickly and Eeyore-like; Wilfred, saintly and tattered; and Ronald, a lifelong child prodigy who found priesthood lonely and ended happily as the cosseted chaplain to a series of great Catholic families.</p>
        <p>''The Knox Brothers'' is engaging and sometimes moving. It is also uneven. It was Fitzgerald's family, and some passages have the home-movie quality of a family newsletter. There are odd gaps, as well, as if the author's closeness imposed silence. She appears several times as a niece; never as a daughter. Her uncles' deaths but not her father's are evoked; her father's second wife is hardly mentioned.</p>
        <p>Fitzgerald was still new at writing, and biography was not her forte (though later she would write a brief, perfect account of the poet Charlotte Mew). And yet ''The Knox Brothers'' provides a striking insight into the elusive nature of her genius.</p>
        <p>Note that of the four brothers it is Wilfred who gets the fewest anecdotes. But he is the one who follows us out of the book and stays. The figures in the biography offer foreshadowing hints of some of those in her novels. (Ronald, for instance, suggests ''the Bernhard,'' the golden little brother in ''The Blue Flower.'') Yet they are far less real.</p>
        <p>Reality was a realm that Fitzgerald, after decades of silent struggle with the all-too-real, was climbing toward. She found it most comically, radiantly and unaccountably in her imagination.</p>
