        <p>The Muslim rebel gunmen who have kidnapped an American in the southern Philippines belong to a particularly brutal faction that has tortured and killed hostages in the past.</p>
        <p>Two days after seizing the man, Jeffrey Schilling, 24, a member of the group told a local radio station today that the rebels were fully prepared to talk with the United States, but only if China, Iraq, Libya and North Korea also took part. On the other hand, the group member, Abu Sabaya, said, ''Maybe we will behead him.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, a spokesman for the State Department, Philip Reeker, ruled out negotiations. He said that the United States would ''not pay ransom, change policies, release prisoners or make any concessions that reward hostage taking.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reeker said the United States would welcome mediation by other nations like Libya, which has longstanding contacts with the rebels and has stepped in to negotiate for the release of a dozen Western hostages kidnapped four months ago by the Abu Sayyaf group. Libyan officials said on Tuesday that they would be willing to help in Mr. Schilling's case.</p>
        <p>Libya has secured the release of six Westerners, paying a ransom of $1 million for each. The chief Philippine negotiator, Roberto Aventajado, said today that he expected the last six to be released soon. But in what could be a troublesome sign for Mr. Schilling's case, Mr. Aventajado said he was optimistic because those other hostages were being held by a separate, and perhaps more amenable, faction of Abu Sayyaf.</p>
        <p>Abu Sayyaf is a minor group in a long-running Muslim separatist war in the south of the Philippines, an overwhelmingly Roman Catholic nation. Unlike the major participants, it has occupied itself more with terror and ransom kidnappings than with ideological warfare. Formed in 1991 by a veteran of the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan, Abu Sayyaf, which means Bearer of the Sword, has earned a reputation as one of the more aggressive of the armed groups in the region.</p>
        <p>In 1993, it killed seven people by rolling grenades down the aisle of a Catholic cathedral. In 1995, it massacred 53 people in a shooting spree in a Christian-dominated village. Its kidnap victims have included Spanish nuns, an American Bible translator, a fishery worker from Hong Kong and, lately, several young women for marriage.</p>
        <p>But it had remained a small group of perhaps 200 armed men until the windfall of ransom money from its recent kidnappings. Some reports say new recruits have swelled its number to as many as 5,000 fighters. As it grew, Abu Sayyaf fragmented into a half-dozen sometimes squabbling factions spread.</p>
        <p>The faction with which Mr. Aventajado has been talking has treated its hostages carefully and has released 24, in return for a reported total of at least $11.5 million, since the new kidnappings began in April.</p>
        <p>Naming two leaders of the faction, Mr. Aventajado said today, ''I have received a letter from Robot and Mujib assuring me that they don't have anything to do with this Schilling abduction.''</p>
        <p>The faction that apparently seized Mr. Schilling is responsible for the kidnapping this year of about 50 Filipino schoolchildren and teachers whom it held for months, sometimes in underground pits. At one point, it beheaded two teachers when the United States did not respond to a demand to release Arab terrorists convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In a rambling radio interview on Tuesday, the Abu Sayyaf member suggested that the group might make a similar demand in return for Mr. Schilling's release. He said formal demands would be announced on Friday. The rebel member asserted that Mr. Schilling worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
        <p>His family and American officials denied that contention. ''This individual is a completely innocent person who has been unjustifiably seized,'' said John Caulfield, the United States consul general in Manila.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schilling is a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley who majored in Near Eastern studies and converted to Islam, his friends said. His mother, Carol, said he went to the Philippines in March because of a longstanding interest in the region and had stayed because he fell in love with a woman from the southern Philippines, Ivi V. Osani.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 2, 2000, Saturday  An article on Thursday about the kidnapping of an American by rebels in the Philippines misstated a comment from a State Department spokesman about the possibility of release negotiations. As the article noted, he said the United States would not ''pay ransom, change policies, release prisoners or make any concessions that reward hostage taking.'' He did not rule out negotiations.</p>
