        <p>Intel filed a lawsuit today accusing the Broadcom Corporation of ''a carefully crafted plan'' to build its business in cable and high-speed networking products by violating Intel patents.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, filed in United States District Court in Delaware, stems from an earlier Intel case that accused Broadcom of misappropriating trade secrets.</p>
        <p>''Nearly every aspect of Broadcom's business -- cable products, high-speed networking products, even semiconductor package configurations -- violates one or more Intel patents,'' the new complaint states. ''Broadcom focused on acquiring Intel technology by inducing Intel employees to disclose trade secrets.''</p>
        <p>Broadcom shares fell $13.50, to $238.44, in Nasdaq trading. Intel shares closed at $73.50, down 56 cents.</p>
        <p>Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, said, ''Typically we would prefer to find some sort of amicable solution, but it is clear that Broadcom does not have any respect for Intel's intellectual property.''</p>
        <p>Bill Blanning, a spokesman for Broadcom, said the company had heard of the suit only through press inquiries. ''We haven't had a chance to review it,'' he said. ''Intel made no effort to contact us or resolve any issues they might have with us. We're confident in the soundness of our business practices and will defend ourselves vigorously.''</p>
        <p>But according to the complaint filed today, Intel made many attempts to contact Broadcom and secure the return of its trade secrets.</p>
        <p>Intel sued Broadcom in a California state court on March 8 in the trade secrets case, and on March 10 that court entered a temporary restraining order prohibiting Broadcom from ''disclosing, using or acquiring'' Intel's trade secrets. Nine days later, the court issued a preliminary injunction against Broadcom.</p>
        <p>In a May 25 order, the California court said there was probable cause to believe that only days after the temporary restraining order was issued, Broadcom's highest management had misappropriated Intel trade secrets under the pretense of employment interviews. The court said that ''Broadcom's approach to protecting Intel's trade secrets was extremely cavalier,'' adding that it found excuses offered in testimony by Broadcom's chief executive, Henry T. Nicholas III, ''unpersuasive and not credible.''</p>
        <p>Broadcom, based in Irvine, Calif., is subject to a court-appointed independent monitor to ensure that it complies with the court's order not to misappropriate Intel's trade secrets.</p>
        <p>Intel said the patents infringed by Broadcom covered a wide range of technologies, including networking products, motion picture decoding used in Broadcom cable products, and packages that Broadcom uses to sell its chips. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., seeks monetary damages to compensate for Broadcom's past infringement and requests the court to block sales of future infringing products.</p>
        <p>Despite the bulk of Intel's charges, Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said that Broadcom had substantial intellectual property of its own, and would inevitably countersue, probably ultimately resulting in a cross-licensing agreement between the two companies.</p>
