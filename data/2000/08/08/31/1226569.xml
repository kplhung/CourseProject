        <p>Werner G. Seifert, the head of the Frankfurt stock market, refused to sweeten the terms of a proposed merger with the London Stock Exchange today, dismissing a rival bid of $1.2 billion by OM Gruppen A.B. of Sweden as ''ridiculous and derisory.''</p>

        <p>Werner G. Seifert, the head of the Frankfurt stock market, refused to sweeten the terms of a proposed merger with the London Stock Exchange today, dismissing a rival bid of $1.2 billion by OM Gruppen A.B. of Sweden as ''ridiculous and derisory.''</p>
        <p>But the unexpected, and hostile, bid by OM Gruppen, which owns the exchange in Stockholm, has ignited speculation about other takeover bids for the London market, potentially from companies that do not even operate securities exchanges at the moment. It has at least temporarily blocked the planned merger with Deutsche Borse A.G., the parent company of the Frankfurt market.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seifert and other German executives asserted today that they would press ahead with their plans, and that Deutsche Borse's shareholders would still vote on the merger plan as previously scheduled on Sept. 14. But the London Stock Exchange has postponed its own shareholder vote, and the plan is for all practical purposes in hiatus.</p>
        <p>Rolf Breuer, chief executive of Deutsche Bank A.G. and chairman of Deutsche Borse, said the exchange might consider organizing a higher counteroffer, possibly in conjunction with the Milan and Madrid exchanges, but said it had no plans yet to mount such an action. In a deal reached this spring, the London and Frankfurt markets agreed to form a carefully balanced merger of equals and to create a pan-European equities exchange called iX.</p>
        <p>German executives said today that they were confident that the Swedish bid would fail to win 75 percent of the shareholder votes at the London Stock Exchange, the minimum required for a takeover to succeed.</p>
        <p>At least for the moment, Mr. Seifert said here today, Deutsche Borse would simply watch the situation unfold.</p>
        <p>''We'll decide to make a move when we feel it's right,'' he said. ''The situation is different now, but not worse.''</p>
        <p>Financial executives across Europe, however, are bracing for the possibility of more bids. ''The London exchange is a sitting duck,'' one executive said. ''This has completely changed the game board.''</p>
        <p>''The debate is no longer about the ins and outs of the iX proposal,'' the executive added. ''The debate is now about who will come along with a biggish wad of cash. Anyone who thinks they would be good at running an exchange can try.''</p>
