        <p>Consumers make lots of choices about the computer itself -- how fast, how much storage, how much RAM -- but a mouse is taken for granted as just part of the package. You have to have a really good reason to change the default mouse.</p>
        <p>Two new optical mice from the manufacturers Logitech and Targus, trying to stand out from the crowd.

        <p>Consumers make lots of choices about the computer itself -- how fast, how much storage, how much RAM -- but a mouse is taken for granted as just part of the package. You have to have a really good reason to change the default mouse.</p>
        <p>Two new optical mice from the manufacturers Logitech and Targus, trying to stand out from the crowd. Optical mice replace the rubber roller ball with light sensors that bounce off any surface and pinpoint the position of the mouse. Since there are no moving parts, it doesn't get clogged with dust or get pitted like the roller ball mice.</p>
        <p>Logitech has added force feedback to its new iFeel mouse. Force feedback is an old concept to computer gamers, but this is a newer addition to a mouse for the general public. For example, in a flight simulation game, when you bank left, a signal is sent to the joystick activating a motor that simulates the effect of resistance to executing the turn that you'd feel in a real plane. Just about everybody uses the technology called TouchSense developed by Immersion Corporation.</p>
        <p>With the iFeel mouse, the same principle is applied when the mouse moves over menu items in any Windows program or hyperlinks on a Web site. Logitech also used Immersion technology. Depending on which of Immersion's options you use, you get a different sensation when you move the mouse over different objects on the screen. It could be a vibration or even a tone. Once the software for the iFeel mouse is loaded, all Windows programs and all Web sites will provide feedback.</p>
        <p>The question, of course, is why does anyone need a mouse that shakes, rattles and rolls? Bruce Schena, vice president and chief technology officer of Immersion, said: ''It's the missing element in how we interact with our computers. We have the visual and auditory component and now we're adding the tactile.'' There are two versions of the Logitech iFeel mouse, the MouseMan ($59) and the Mouse ($39).</p>
        <p>Targus, on the other hand, is aiming its new optical mouse at mobile professionals and those with cramped computing space. Anyone who has tried to use a laptop on a plane knows that there is barely room for the computer on the tray, let alone an external mouse. Targus's Mini-Mouse ($49.99) is half the size of the standard mouse. The U.S.B. mouse comes with a converter that allows older laptops without a U.S.B. port to use the mouse (although the computer must run Windows 98 or higher).</p>
