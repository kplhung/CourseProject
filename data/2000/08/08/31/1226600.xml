        <p>''I CLEAN my own house, I swear!'' insists Pat Lazio. ''Couldn't you tell from the upstairs?''</p>
        <p>Wife, mother, car-pooler, volunteer, part-time worker and full-time campaign spouse. Do we really believe that Mrs. Rick A. Lazio is also responsible for the spotless hardwood floors, grease-free kitchen counters and tidied piles of shelter magazines of this pleasant, unremarkable -- few bookshelves -- Long Island ranch house? (The furnishings, American-traditional lite, seem quite Republican, as is Representative Lazio.)</p>
        <p>The upstairs that Mrs. Lazio deplores as a ''wreck'' includes the gently tumbled rooms of their two young daughters. All told, the house is so gleamingly neat that her visitor, a clutter queen, is seized by envious incredulity.</p>
        <p>But in this senatorial campaign, in which Mrs. Lazio's corresponding opponent happens to be the president of the United States and topics like marriage and domicile are leitmotifs, details like who cleans the Lazio home and cares for their daughters have drawn more attention than they otherwise might have.</p>
        <p>By all reports, the Lazios, married a decade, are close. On the campaign trail, he often turns around, looking for her. She fusses over his schedule, the shine on his shoes.</p>
        <p>They work to project the image of an ordinary, loving suburban couple. Mrs. Lazio, a taut, slim woman, answers the door almost makeup-free, wearing sandals, a cardigan and stretch pants: she may well have just come back from the supermarket, except that she is accompanied by a campaign aide with a pearl necklace and a tape recorder.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lazio repairs to the living room, which looks onto the playhouse and swing set. She is hearty but guarded, with a jaw that can tighten.</p>
        <p>Biggest surprise so far?</p>
        <p>''I don't mean to talk political,'' she says, ''but I just didn't expect Rick's record to be distorted as much as it's been,'' adding, ''It's upsetting, particularly when it's not true. Rick is the most honest, decent man I know.''</p>
        <p>She continues heating up. The aide, Mollie Fullington, murmurs a fine-tuning: ''I've heard you say that you're protective. I think that's something. You've talked about being concerned.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lazio catches herself. ''Right. Exactly.''</p>
        <p>Is she a superwoman? During the squall over Mr. Lazio's stock investments, he told reporters that his wife had become indignant, retorting: ''I clean my own house. We have nothing to be ashamed of.'' On Monday, Mr. Lazio's aides provided access to 10 years of the couple's tax returns. No taxes paid for salaries of domestic help.</p>
        <p>''We never had a 'nanny,' '' Mrs. Lazio says, bracketing that word with her fingertips. A nurse practitioner with a master's degree, Patricia Moriarty Lazio has experience in general surgery, intensive-care and cardiac-care wards. But she stopped working until their daughters -- Molly is 8, Kelsey, 7 -- started school. With Mr. Lazio in Washington three, four nights a week, the girls need stability, she says.</p>
        <p>NOW she works one day a week at a local hospital, as its breast cancer community liaison, and volunteers for a group that helps cancer patients. Her parents and his mother baby-sit. This household rhythm is familiar: her father, a retired New York police officer who juggled several jobs to make ends meet, was, like her husband, often away; her mother, who raised four children, held down the fort, as does Mrs. Lazio. ''I miss clinical nursing,'' she says, adding, ''The decision was based on the children.''</p>
        <p>A product of Long Island Catholic schools, Mrs. Lazio grew up apolitical. After graduating from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, she moved to Washington, where her brother Michael was in law school. She wanted to sample city life. ''I grew up as a suburban kid and Manhattan was too overwhelming.''</p>
        <p>Her brother introduced her to a classmate, Mr. Lazio. The couple married after an eight-year courtship (she issued an ultimatum). Mr. Moriarty volunteers for his brother-in-law's campaign.</p>
        <p>Her husband's career compelled Mrs. Lazio, who describes herself as shy, to develop deft social skills.</p>
        <p>Those formal Washington dinners! She laughs. ''Rick's seated at one table and you're at another,'' she says. The seating is ''boy, girl.'' Her dining companions are ''very intelligent policy-type men and you're a mother with two young girls at home in suburban Long Island.'' She does her best, she says, to find common conversational ground.</p>
        <p>She has been to the White House, of course. The first couple? Road-tested, Mrs. Lazio declines to comment.</p>
        <p>Asked whether campaign scrutiny has compelled her to freshen her appearance, she makes a veiled jab at her husband's opponent. ''It's important not to remake yourself,'' she says. ''I shouldn't suddenly become this beauty queen type of person.''</p>
        <p>Her job, she says, is to support Mr. Lazio, whom she repeatedly characterizes as a kind, loving family man. ''I'm not competing with my husband for a spot in the limelight.'' Jab.</p>
        <p>Later, reached on the phone, the congressman will praise her: ''I feel the balance is tilted in my favor -- she does more for me than I for her.''</p>
        <p>Indeed. Mrs. Lazio's 40th birthday is Sept. 13. Does her husband have something special planned?</p>
        <p>She looks chagrined. ''Rick is debating his opponent,'' she replies.  ''We'll be in Buffalo.''</p>
