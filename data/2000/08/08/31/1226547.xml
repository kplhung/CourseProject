        <p>In the latest twist to years of artistic and administrative turmoil, Vladimir Vasilyev was dismissed as director of the Bolshoi Theater, Russia's premier opera and ballet company, in a decree signed on Monday by President Vladimir Putin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vasilyev and a deputy, Vladimir Kokonin, were removed and their posts eliminated. The theater will now be run by a general director and an artistic director, who have not been officially named. Mr. Vasilyev was not informed in advance but heard about the decision on the radio.</p>
        <p>As head of entire Bolshoi Theater, Mr. Vasilyev, a former ballet star, was responsible for both artistic and administrative policy. He was appointed in 1995 by President Boris Yeltsin in a decision meant to put an end to the divisive rule over the ballet company by Yuri Grigorovich, a brilliant choreographer whose policies were attacked as dictatorial.</p>
        <p>Although the timing of the decision was a surprise, with the theater closed on Monday and both companies on tour, people familiar with the Bolshoi had speculated for months about impending changes there. Rumors had circulated that Valery Gergiev, the conductor and artistic director of St. Petersburg's Mariinsky Theater, would be charged with restoring the Bolshoi's faded glory.</p>
        <p>The likely appointees, however, are Anatoly Iksanov, a former director of St. Petersburg's Bolshoi Drama Theater, who is not well known to the public but is respected in theater circles, as general director, and Gennady Rozhdestvensky, the conductor, as artistic director. But Mr. Gergiev's Mariinsky is clearly a model for the new direction. Russia's culture minister, Mikhail Shvydkoi, said the main reason for reorganizing the theater's management was an extremely expensive project to renovate the main Bolshoi building, which is 143 years old and deteriorating significantly, and to construct an adjacent sister theater.</p>
        <p>The plan, announced in December, with work on the main building scheduled to begin in 2001, has drawn criticism. Parts of the plan are half completed, and others have never been clearly defined. The project is being supported by Unesco, but agency officials have complained of difficulties in dealing with Bolshoi bureaucrats.</p>
        <p>''The theater must be under the authority of those who are responsible for the financial flow and are called upon to ensure its reconstruction and construction,'' Mr. Shvydkoi told Moskovskiye Novosti, a Moscow newspaper. ''For a minimum of the next five years the key figure will be the administrative and not the artistic director. Moreover, the volume of building and technological work is so great that it is unlikely, I think, that a serious cultural figure will risk taking on such responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shvydkoi spoke of the realities of the market economy, which is reshaping the way Russian cultural institutions function after decades of state control and financing and years of post-Soviet decline.</p>
        <p>''We will restore the system of administration, which will be headed by a manager,'' Mr. Shvydkoi said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's decree subordinates the theater to the Ministry of Culture. According to Mr. Yeltsin's 1995 order, the Bolshoi administration answered to the prime minister, which according to critics meant that in effect it answered to no one.</p>
        <p>''The theater demanded everything from everyone, but didn't have to do anything for anyone,'' said Yaroslav Sedov, a music and dance critic for the news magazine Itogi.</p>
        <p>Some, though, have criticized the culture minister for trying to take too much under his control. Mr. Shvydkoi's ministry recently took over the state film ministry.</p>
        <p>While critics could forgive Mr. Vasilyev his shortcomings as an administrator, they were angry about his failure to revive the Bolshoi artistically. His staging of ''Swan Lake'' was deemed a flop, but what critics found even more dismaying was his inability to introduce the new ideas he had promised when appointed.</p>
        <p>The touring success of the Bolshoi, critics say, was built on the strength of highly talented dancers and fail-safe favorites like ''Don Quixote,'' performed during this summer's United States tour. And while foreigners know the Bolshoi primarily as a ballet company, in Russia it has historically been revered for its opera. Critics hope a new director will be able to restore that luster.</p>
        <p>''Young opera directors need to be invited,'' said Vadim Gayevsky, a ballet scholar and critic. ''There are wonderful, unknown directors here. They won't stage nonsense, but real operas. They will stage Prokofiev and Shostakovich. Right now there is only one Prokofiev in the repertory. The revival must first of all be in opera. If they open the door to the young generation, then everything can become brilliant.''</p>
