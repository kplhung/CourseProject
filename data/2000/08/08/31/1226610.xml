        <p>Further consolidation is expected in US securities industry, and speculation now centers on which firms will survive; proposed sale of the midsize Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette to Credit Suisse Group indicates that securities firms need to be diverse, both geographically and in their lines of business, to serve the biggest corporations; J P Morgan and Lehman Brothers Holdings may be too small to be among the survivors unless they buy or are bought by other banks or brokerage firms; even Merrill Lynch, which has biggest network of stockbrokers in the world, may be vulnerable unless it keeps pace with other top investment banks: Goldman Sachs Group, Credit Suisse, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter; photo (M)</p>

        <p>For years, David H. Komansky, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, has been predicting that the financial world will one day be dominated by a handful of global giants. That forecast has become accepted wisdom on Wall Street but figuring out who the eventual rulers will be -- and how many of them will be based in the United States -- is not getting much easier.</p>
        <p>What is clear is that several Wall Street firms, including J. P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers Holdings, are too small to be among them unless they buy or are bought by other banks or brokerage firms. The proposed sale of the midsize investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette to the Credit Suisse Group is the clearest sign yet that securities firms need to be diverse, both geographically and in their lines of business, to serve the biggest corporations.</p>
        <p>Even Merrill Lynch, with the biggest network of stockbrokers in the world, is not assured a seat at the head table if its competitors continue to grow at a faster pace. Merrill is no bigger than any of the other companies generally considered to rank among the world's top five investment banks.</p>
        <p>Its stock market valuation of about $56 billion makes it the equal of the Goldman Sachs Group and Credit Suisse and considerably smaller than Citigroup and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. By that measure, Merrill is only about 10 percent bigger than the discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corporation.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe the management of Merrill Lynch or Goldman Sachs woke up this morning and said, 'Gee, this is great,' '' said Michael Holland, president of the money-management firm Holland &amp; Company, referring to Credit Suisse's proposed $12.8 billion purchase of Donaldson, which was officially announced yesterday. ''It is clearly a more competitive creature.''</p>
        <p>Joe L. Roby, Donaldson's chief executive who will be chairman of First Boston's executive committee for three years after the merger, said his management team decided to sell now because ''there's significant change afoot in our industry.'' Alluding to consolidation that he expects to continue, he said, ''We were concerned about activities around us which could have an impact on our competitive position.''</p>
        <p>Jerome P. Kenney, a Merrill executive vice president who formulates corporate strategy, acknowledged that the combination of Donaldson and Credit Suisse's Credit Suisse First Boston investment bank, appears competitive with Merrill on paper. ''One firm is elevated and could be ranked higher than we are in a few categories,'' he said. ''This will be a tougher challenge for us but one we think we're ready for.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kenney said Merrill's executives had long anticipated the consolidation in financial services now taking place. They expected Donaldson to be snapped up by a competitor and believe similar acquisitions were inevitable, he said.</p>
        <p>''Within three years, we expect there to be no major midsize independent securities firms in this country,'' he said. ''We'll end up with 6 to 10 top-tier global players.''</p>
        <p>A few years ago, Merrill, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were an unchallenged triumvirate known as ''MGM'' on Wall Street. But several changes have shaken up the ranks of investment banks: Morgan Stanley merged with the Dean Witter brokerage firm and grew much larger; Salomon Brothers merged with the Smith Barney brokerage firm and then became part of the Citigroup financial conglomerate, and Goldman Sachs went public and raised capital to finance its growth.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Credit Suisse became a contender by building up its technology-banking practice in Silicon Valley, just in time to cash in on the bonanza of Internet stock offerings. Another Swiss bank, UBS A.G., has acquired two investment banks in the last five years and is in the process of buying PaineWebber Group, the fourth-largest brokerage firm in the United States, for about $12 billion.</p>
        <p>A third big European bank, Deutsche Bank of Germany, acquired a presence on Wall Street by buying Bankers Trust and its Alex. Brown brokerage unit, based in Baltimore. And the Chase Manhattan Corporation, which owns the nation's third-biggest bank, has been buying up investment banks with the hope of becoming competitive in a hurry.</p>
        <p>Each of those banks has the resources to buy one or more of the remaining independent firms on Wall Street. The imbalance of supply to the potential demand has driven up the prices of shares of those firms, including Lehman Brothers, J. P. Morgan and Bear Stearns.</p>
        <p>The pending purchase of Donaldson has set a floor under the prices those firms would fetch, analysts said. Credit Suisse has agreed to pay about three times Donaldson's book value, or the value of its assets minus liabilities.</p>
        <p>Some analysts said other firms would sell for a higher multiple of their book value, either because they have more stable revenue and earnings than Donaldson or because a merger involving them would not involve as much cost-cutting and as many layoffs as are expected in the Donaldson deal.</p>
        <p>Officials of Donaldson and First Boston said they expected to eliminate about 2,500 jobs in merging the two firms, or about 9 percent of the combined work force of 26,000. Richard Thornburgh, First Boston's chief financial officer, said that number was low compared with some bank mergers.</p>
        <p>But some analysts said they expected more. ''There will be a lot of carnage here, tons,'' said Steven Eisman, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer. In addition to layoffs, he said, ''I  see a lot of people coming in here and picking off employees.''</p>
        <p>Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said he thought J. P. Morgan was the truly attractive target on Wall Street because it had a strong money-management business that produces steady fees. He estimates that J.P. Morgan could be acquired for $180 to $240 a share, compared with its current price of $151.06.</p>
        <p>''The second-tier firms share a lot of the challenges that D.L.J. confronted,'' he said. ''After this, they will have a deep-seated need to reassess a go-it-alone strategy. That's not to say that some of the bigger companies might not react too.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kraushaar said that Chase ''had an interest in D.L.J.'' and seemed ''eager and willing to look at anything that might come on the block.''</p>
