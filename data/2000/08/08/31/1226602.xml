        <p>There are still four days to go before the regular season begins, but the Jets are very unlikely to experience a comeback any more evocative than the one Kevin Williams has already fashioned this week.</p>
        <p>Less than a year after he hovered near death while breathing with the help of a respirator, and only six months after he was released from his doctors' care, Williams was named the starting free safety for Sunday's season opener against the Packers, regaining -- against mind-boggling odds -- a job he held, and lost, as a rookie in 1998.</p>
        <p>Williams won a three-way competition for the job, beating out Scott Frost and Omar Stoutmire, who has since been let go by the Jets and signed by the Giants. Williams, with six tackles, had what seemed a low-key preseason in a porous secondary. Meanwhile, Frost had 10 tackles and an interception, and Stoutmire was on the field for all three of the Giants' touchdowns in the preseason game. Frost, Coach Al Groh said today, will play a considerable amount.</p>
        <p>Williams had to regain the 34 pounds he lost off his 6-foot, 192-pound frame. But once Williams appeared at minicamp, Groh said, his recovery from the airborne virus that settled into his throat and lungs during a trip to Denver in the fourth week of last season -- which required three procedures to treat -- was no longer an issue.</p>
        <p>''His evaluation was based strictly on his performance and what my expectations were given his physical talent,'' Groh said. ''With three training camps on his resume and the personal circumstance he's endured, it has given him personal and competitive maturity.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Williams was on the field for the season opener against San Francisco, when the Jets faced a dominating quarterback in Steve Young. Williams struggled that day and started only six games that season.</p>
        <p>Last season, he played in only the first four games, starting in none of them, and recorded only one tackle in the game against Denver before the devastating illness took hold. Williams remained in the hospital for 27 days, and for two weeks was heavily sedated. Of that period, he says he remembers about 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>During that time, Williams underwent three procedures to clear an abscess from his throat, to clean fluid from his neck and to clean bacteria from his chest. While he was sick, Williams said that he thought little about football; only after his ordeal was over did he contemplate what would have happened if he could not have returned.</p>
        <p>''It looked as if I could have very easily gone the other way,'' Williams said. ''I'm blessed to be here.''</p>
        <p>Williams's teammates remember when he returned to the locker room last November for the first time after his illness. The sight of him, thin and weak, stunned them.</p>
        <p>''It was very frightening,'' safety Victor Green said. ''One minute you see a guy who is healthy. And the next minute, he's gasping for air. For me, I'd really have to think about not playing football. But Kevin has a lot of heart and he wasn't going to give up.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>RICK LYLE will start at left defensive end and SHANE BURTON at right end Sunday, meaning none of the four first-round draft picks will start, although Coach AL GROH said defensive end SHAUN ELLIS, who started the last three preseason games at left end, and linebacker JOHN ABRAHAM will get considerable playing time. Groh said earlier this week that FRED BAXTER, the veteran backup tight end, would start over the rookie ANTHONY BECHT. . . . Hofstra's VAUGHN SANDERS had a short stay on the practice squad. He was bumped off today when the Jets brought in running back MARLION JACKSON, who was in camp with the Bears after playing only two seasons of college football at Division II Saginaw Valley State in Michigan.</p>
