        <p>Sticking to message like epoxy, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush continued their efforts today to set the terms of engagement in their presidential contest, with Mr. Gore promoting his plans to fortify Medicare and Mr. Bush pledging to increase federal aid to college students.</p>
        <p>Both men studiously avoided responding to the other's swipes as the campaign settled into a day-by-day battle for control of the policy agenda. The Gore campaign believes it prospers if the debate centers on health care, while the Bush campaign, both in its advertising and the focus of its candidate, sees education as the key to stealing women's votes from the Democrats.</p>
        <p>But wary of appearing defensive, the candidates have been careful not to engage the opposition. Last week, the Bush campaign was thrown somewhat off balance by Mr. Gore's attacks on his proposed income tax cut and Mr. Bush's own admission that he had to do a better job of explaining his plan.</p>
        <p>Neither candidate wants to fall into that trap this week. Mr. Gore spent the day arguing that Mr. Bush's proposed income tax cut would not leave enough of the federal surplus to protect Medicare, a charge that Mr. Bush ignored. Mr. Bush, meanwhile, accused Mr. Gore and President Clinton of overseeing ''seven years of stagnancy'' in education, and Mr. Gore likewise acted as if he had not heard the charge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, the Democratic nominee, rejoined his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, today at a forum on Medicare at Portland State University here. As has been the case throughout a week devoted to health policy, the minutiae of Mr. Gore's remarks concerned insurance coverage, but his underlying purpose was to demonstrate his deep philosophical differences with Mr. Bush over how to spend the federal surplus.</p>
        <p>''The other side has placed its top priority on taking virtually all of this projected surplus and giving it all in the form of a giant tax cut, mainly to the wealthy,'' Mr. Gore said. ''And their theory is that's going to be good for the country, and they say it's your money. Well, it is your money. But it's your Medicare, it's your Social Security, it's your environment, it's your school system, it's your country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore renewed his call today for spending $339 billion over 10 years to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program and to restore Medicare financing to teaching hospitals, nursing homes, rural hospitals, home health care aides, and rehabilitative services. Money for those programs was cut under the 1997 balanced budget act, and Mr. Gore said today that those reductions ''went too far.''</p>
        <p>He also said he would extend the solvency of Medicare by putting the $400 billion Medicare surplus that is expected in the next decade in a so-called lock box to protect it from spending raids by Congress. Under Mr. Gore's plan, that money would be used to reduce the federal debt, saving $75 billion in interest payments that would then be used to extend the solvency of Medicare from 2025 to 2030.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also rejected the majority conclusions reached last year by a bipartisan commission on Medicare, saying he would not support raising the Medicare eligibility age to 67 from 65, forcing the elderly into managed care, or raising premiums and co-payments.</p>
        <p>One of those who has supported such measures in the past is Mr. Lieberman, who sided with Republicans in several balanced-budget votes in 1997 to raise the eligibility age and to impose increases in premiums and fees for some Medicare recipients.</p>
        <p>''It is important to put these votes in context,'' said Dan Gerstein, Mr. Lieberman's Senate press secretary. ''At the time projections were that the system would be bankrupt in four or five years. Senator Lieberman and a lot of other people saw it as necessary to salvage the program.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerstein noted Mr. Lieberman voted last year against the recommendations of the bipartisan commission to further restrict eligibility and allow some additional charges for recipients.</p>
        <p>''His recent record shows he's very much in synch with the vice president,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush plans to spell out his Medicare reform proposals in a major address on Tuesday in Allentown, Pa. His aides have said he would base his plan on bipartisan Senate legislation that would give Medicare recipients the ability to choose between a variety of public and private insurance plans. They have said that such a restructuring of Medicare, by promoting competition, would produce savings to keep the program solvent for the long term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's plan, said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, would amount to tinkering when compared to Mr. Bush's yet-to-be-announced approach.</p>
        <p>''You're extending the day of reckoning by five years?'' Mr. Bartlett asked. ''That's not leadership. That's passing the buck.''</p>
        <p>In Erie, Pa., today, Mr. Bush proposed expanding the federal Pell grant program to help more low-income students attend college, warning that the achievement gap separating rich and poor, black and white students was widening.</p>
        <p>In a speech before local Republicans, a subdued Mr. Bush focused heavily on education for the third day this week, emphasizing local control and school accountability, while attacking Mr. Gore for upholding what he called a failed status quo.</p>
        <p>''Today, incredibly enough in our country, 7 out of 10 fourth graders in our highest poverty schools cannot read,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They are children who are destined to be locked into failed hopes and diminished dreams. The achievement gap between minority and non-minority students is wide and growing wider. And we must do something about it in America early, before it's too late.''</p>
        <p>This year, the federal government is expected to award nearly $8 billion in Pell grants to 3.8 million students, more than half of whom come from families making less than $15,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Arguing that freshman year is often the most difficult for college students, Mr. Bush proposed increasing the maximum first-year Pell grant to $5,100 per student, from $3,300. The proposal would cost $5 billion over five years, his aides said. Under the Clinton administration, spending on Pell grants has increased by $1.5 billion, to $7.9 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush today also called for building a $1.5 billion federal fund over the next five years to help states create or expand merit scholarship programs. And he proposed abolishing federal taxes on so-called pre-paid college tuition plans that allow parents to create special escrow accounts to finance future tuition costs. This program would cost $275 million over five years, his aides said.</p>
        <p>With the campaign having taken a more testy turn in recent days, Mr. Bush sought to capture the high ground today by repeatedly calling for greater civility. Without mentioning Mr. Gore by name, he suggested the vice president had poisoned the presidential debate with negative, overly partisan campaigning.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Lieberman said he expected to talk less about religion than he has this week, after he came under criticism for saying that faith should play a greater role in public life.</p>
        <p>''I don't expect this to be a major theme of the campaign,'' Mr. Leiberman said in a interview in Portland,  where he appeared with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>He said the emphasis on religion had resulted from the novelty of his selection as the first Jewish nominee for national office, and from the timing quirk of his appearing on Sunday in a church in Detroit and Monday at a meeting of religious leaders in Chicago, events that he said naturally led to talk of faith.</p>
