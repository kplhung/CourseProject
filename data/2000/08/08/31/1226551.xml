        <p>Art and commerce collide in Davide Mascherini's collection of inch-wide bottle caps, or crowns, as he calls them, which can be seen on his Web site (members.xoom.it/davidekorn /index.htm). The site features bottle tops from beverages from 159 countries. Some -- Aruba, Benin, Mali and Togo, for example -- are represented by one cap each. Countries like the United States, Poland and Germany are represented by hundreds of crowns.</p>
        <p>Pepsi and Coke can be found almost everywhere, from Pakistan to Hungary, but local favorites like Inca Kola, from Peru, can be seen on the site, too.</p>
