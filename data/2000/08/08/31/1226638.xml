        <p>The most eagerly awaited race today at Saratoga Race Course probably won't be the feature, the 23rd running of the Albany Stakes. Instead, it might be the fifth race on the card, a mile-and-a-sixteenth affair on the turf for 3-year-old fillies who have never won a race. The reason? The likely favorite is named The Parting Glass, after the popular Irish pub on Lake Avenue in Saratoga Springs.</p>
        <p>Yes, The Parting Glass has two impressive second-place finishes on the grass, but the filly will be well bet because of what she represents: the 19-year-old bar that has become the town's nexus for locals and summer vacationers, horse owners and low-wage grooms, and jockeys and trainers, all of whom sit and talk about -- what else? -- horse racing.</p>

        <p>The most eagerly awaited race today at Saratoga Race Course probably won't be the feature, the 23rd running of the Albany Stakes. Instead, it might be the fifth race on the card, a mile-and-a-sixteenth affair on the turf for 3-year-old fillies who have never won a race. The reason? The likely favorite is named The Parting Glass, after the popular Irish pub on Lake Avenue in Saratoga Springs.</p>
        <p>Yes, The Parting Glass has two impressive second-place finishes on the grass, but the filly will be well bet because of what she represents: the 19-year-old bar that has become the town's nexus for locals and summer vacationers, horse owners and low-wage grooms, and jockeys and trainers, all of whom sit and talk about -- what else? -- horse racing.</p>
        <p>''She'll go off even money,'' Frank Carcaterra, a drummer and the longtime bartender at the Parting Glass, said of the filly of the same name, who has raced four times before today.</p>
        <p>The owner of both the horse and the bar, Joan Desadora, said she doesn't care about the filly's odds,  but she has run this race so often in her head that she worries about the aftermath of victory.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be so crowded in the winner's circle, just crazy,'' said Desadora, who owns the horse with Kenneth C. Avanzino.</p>
        <p>Don't blame Desadora for looking ahead -- she has earned the right after surviving an earlier foray as an owner that was deeply disheartening. For years, Desadora, 60, has been tending to the backstretch crowd -- from the jockeys and trainers to those with little income -- as a host and benefactor.</p>
        <p>Desadora has raised money to help disabled jockeys, this year presenting a check for $10,007. She has turned her music stage over to everyone from the bass-playing trainer Bob Baffert to the jockey warbler Mike Luzzi to the Little Big Band, fronted by the New York Racing Association's assistant communications director, Fran LaBelle, which so far has raised more than $2,000 for the backside day-care center at Belmont Park from its weekly Thursday night gigs.</p>
        <p>In 1998, she decided to buy a horse. Carcaterra introduced her to the owner Warren Blasland and the pair bought Run Man Run for $50,000. The gelding proceeded to race off to five victories, including the Grade I Malibu Stakes at Santa Anita in California, which produced more than $250,000 in purses.</p>
        <p>Soon, however, came heartbreak. Run Man Run was injured, and Desadora said the horse's trainer failed to tell her about it and hid the horse from her. She said that she finally found Run Man Run, in awful shape, on a farm outside of town.</p>
        <p>Desadora paid for surgery to repair the gelding's fractured leg, sent Run Man Run to a farm in the Hudson Valley for six months of recovery and, with the help of thoroughbred retirement specialists, finally found him a home in Lexington, Ky., at a correctional facility where inmates care for horses.</p>
        <p>The episode drained Desadora of Run Man Run's winnings, but not her enthusiasm for the sport or the people involved in it. At night, she still beams when riders like Jose Santos and Robbie Davis walk through the doors.</p>
        <p>And most mornings, she is at the barn of her new trainer, Tom Skiffington, to check on The Parting Glass and distribute carrots and peppermints to any lovely creature who sticks a nose out of a stall.</p>
        <p>''I'm a more informed owner,'' she said. ''I was intimidated the first go-around and I blame myself. Now I understand that it is my horse and I can ask all the questions I like.''</p>
        <p>For the first time in the history of the Parting Glass, the pub's doors will be locked today from 1:30 to 4 p.m. so her sisters who help run the place, Gloria and Rosemarie, as well as her staff can root their namesake on to a first victory.</p>
        <p>The Parting Glass will be ridden by Jean Luc-Samyn, whose agent, Ralph Theroux Jr., fittingly is a featured vocalist with the Little Big Band. Even if the filly ends up bringing bettors only a $2 payoff, or even worse, fails to win, Desadora promises her customers a memorable day.</p>
        <p>''You know, the track is the most beautiful place in the world and we're all going to enjoy it,'' she said.</p>
