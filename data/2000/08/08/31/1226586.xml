      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Peru has taken a step in the right direction by revoking the life sentence that a military tribunal imposed on Lori Berenson four and a half years ago after a sham trial. Now it must ensure that the civilian court that will retry the Berenson case observes the basic standards of justice that the military court ignored.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berenson was originally charged with helping terrorists of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement plan an attack on Peru's Congress. At her trial she was not allowed to challenge the prosecution's evidence or cross-examine its witnesses. Neither could she call witnesses in her own behalf. Now Peru says it has uncovered new evidence suggesting that Ms. Berenson never played a leadership role in the guerrilla organization, something that might have been discovered much earlier had she not been denied a fair trial.</p>

        <p>Peru has taken a step in the right direction by revoking the life sentence that a military tribunal imposed on Lori Berenson four and a half years ago after a sham trial. Now it must ensure that the civilian court that will retry the Berenson case observes the basic standards of justice that the military court ignored.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berenson was originally charged with helping terrorists of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement plan an attack on Peru's Congress. At her trial she was not allowed to challenge the prosecution's evidence or cross-examine its witnesses. Neither could she call witnesses in her own behalf. Now Peru says it has uncovered new evidence suggesting that Ms. Berenson never played a leadership role in the guerrilla organization, something that might have been discovered much earlier had she not been denied a fair trial.</p>
        <p>The exact nature of her relationship with Tupac Amaru has yet to be established. A fair trial could help clarify it. She openly supports the group's political aims, but claims she was unaware of its violent methods. A year after her trial, Tupac Amaru guerrillas invaded the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, seizing hostages.</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Berenson, thousands of Peruvians arrested in President Alberto Fujimori's anti-terrorist sweeps of the mid-1990's were denied due process and subjected to years of harsh imprisonment. Many of those Peruvians have now been released. Ms. Berenson's fate depends on the outcome of her second trial.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has been rightly critical of President Fujimori for rigging his own re-election earlier this year. By assuring a fair trial for Ms. Berenson, he can help make relations with Washington somewhat less frosty. But until Peru is again a democracy and its judicial system fully independent, there can be no return to the traditional cordiality between the two countries.</p>
