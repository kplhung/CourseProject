      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For all those who find life dull without a political sex scandal to fill the voids in their existences, a new play by John Dooley called ''High Infidelity'' is about a senator and his wife, each of whom suspects the other of philandering.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dooley has taken the basic premises of television soap opera, sitcom and game shows and melded them into a trite playlet that is distinguished only by the incredibility of the plot and the characters. The show does boast two television veterans in John Davidson and Morgan Fairchild, as the senator and his wife, but ''High Fidelity'' is unfortunately being played before a live audience at the Promenade Theater without benefit of a laugh track. It's ''Falcon Crest'' meets ''Hollywood Squares.''</p>

        <p>For all those who find life dull without a political sex scandal to fill the voids in their existences, a new play by John Dooley called ''High Infidelity'' is about a senator and his wife, each of whom suspects the other of philandering.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dooley has taken the basic premises of television soap opera, sitcom and game shows and melded them into a trite playlet that is distinguished only by the incredibility of the plot and the characters. The show does boast two television veterans in John Davidson and Morgan Fairchild, as the senator and his wife, but ''High Fidelity'' is unfortunately being played before a live audience at the Promenade Theater without benefit of a laugh track. It's ''Falcon Crest'' meets ''Hollywood Squares.''</p>
        <p>The setup is a crisis in the 30-year marriage of Senator Charles Gordon and his wife, Ellen, which has been building for years. It is the 1970's, and the senator is making a run at the presidency. The marital discord could be a problem for him, and he and his wife have agreed to see a famous therapist on the Jersey shore. They can barely manage to work in one three-hour session with the doctor and his foxy young assistant to fix their marriage.</p>
        <p>What follows is a cartoon view of both politics and therapy. For example in an opening scene (it goes on and on and on for several minutes) a Secret Service agent tries to establish the credentials of the marriage counselor. He reads the doctor's calling card: ''Dr. Edward Finger. The rapist.''</p>
        <p>''That's therapist,'' the doctor corrects. Even his name prompts a gag: his therapy program is called ''the Finger treatment.''</p>
        <p>It's all pretty silly, but even that might have some redeeming comedic value if Mr. Dooley didn't try to turn a juvenile sitcom into a soap opera by laying some meditations on the loneliness of political life and the importance of truth in a healthy marriage on top of the one-liners. As for the game-show aspect of the exercise, Dr. Finger has his clients participate in several as part of his regimen: there's the dance game, the shout game, the stare game, the confession game and the truth game. All this in one three-hour session. (Don't worry; the play itself doesn't last that long.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Dooley asks his audience to accept a lot. First we are supposed to believe that it is a top-level secret that a United States senator and his wife have been having verbal and physical donnybrooks in public. (If they were in public, how are they still a secret?) Then there is the question of how a couple who have spoken nothing but insults to each other for years can find love and forgiveness in three hours, especially under the guidance of a therapist like Dr. Finger, who, as played by Neil Maffin, is a hippie dropout who wears bell-bottoms and sandals and recites a mantra before seeing patients.</p>
        <p>The list could go on. And although there is a lot of talk about sex, which one presumes is meant to be shocking -- ''Take off all your clothes,'' the doctor orders his patients at one point (mercifully, they don't) -- ''High Infidelity'' is strictly PG.</p>
        <p>Neither Luke Yankee's direction nor the two main supporting performances do much to help the play's credibility gap. Mr. Maffin, who looks a bit like a young Sam Shepard disguised as a beach boy, plays Dr. Finger as a sort of castaway from ''Gilligan's Island.'' Jennifer Roszell portrays the doctor's assistant as if she were auditioning for a guest spot on ''Sex and the City.'' Dan Ziskie does what he can with a Secret Service agent whose chief defining characteristic is that he suffers from hemorrhoids.</p>
        <p>As for the two stars, they are both professionals and soldier through all this material as if it made sense. They make their marks and say their lines. Ms. Fairchild always looks in control, although her accent slips in and out of a slight drawl, as if she were not sure whether her character should come from ''Dallas'' or one of her other television hits. Mr. Davidson comports himself with the dignity befitting a pompous politician and gets perhaps the show's biggest laughs in a couple of pratfalls off a clear plastic beanbag chair.</p>
