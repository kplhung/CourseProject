        <p>A mysterious derailment injured 24 passengers in the Paris subway today, but a catastrophe was narrowly averted because the car that had tipped over skidded to a halt only three feet from a train on the opposite track.</p>
        <p>Accidents in the Paris subway, which celebrated its 100th birthday this year, are rare. Many of the trains, which run more slowly and considerably more quietly than New York subways, have side wheels that help stabilize them.</p>
        <p>Today's derailment happened at 1:23 p.m. as the lead car of a No. 12 train coming into the Notre-Dame-de-Lorette station at normal speed just ''keeled over on the opposite track,'' said Alain Caire, controller general of security for the subway system. In his 31 years on the job, Mr. Caire said, ''I never saw a train keel over like that.''</p>
        <p>Passengers suffered cuts and bruises, and one had a leg broken.  Nearly 200 firefighters in 20 trucks converged on the scene and set up first-aid stations on the subway platform and in a nearby cafe. The neighborhood was closed off for hours by dozens of police officers.</p>
