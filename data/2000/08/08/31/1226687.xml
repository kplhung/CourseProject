        <p>The head of South Korea's largest brokerage house, Hyundai Securities, resigned, bowing to pressure from the government and creditor banks that had accused him of hindering restructuring efforts at its parent company, the Hyundai Group, South Korea's largest conglomerate. The executive, Lee Ik Chi, 56, has been a close aide to the Chung family that founded Hyundai Group. Creditor banks blamed Mr. Lee, and other executives loyal to the Chung family, for playing a major role leading to the financial trouble at the conglomerate. His resignation will be accepted at a board meeting scheduled for next Monday, Hyundai Securities said.</p>
