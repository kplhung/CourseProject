        <p>Saratoga once again lived up to its nickname as the graveyard of favorites today when a nondescript 4-year-old colt named Shadow Caster pulled off a stunning upset to take the 21st running of the Grade II $250,000 Forego Handicap.</p>
        <p>Shadow Caster, at 50-1 the longest shot in a field of 10 top-level sprinters, survived a vicious speed duel with the 2-1 favorite, Richter Scale, and then held off Intidab by a length at the wire. Successful Appeal, the second choice at 5-2, was another nose back in third, as Richter Scale faded to sixth.</p>

        <p>Saratoga once again lived up to its nickname as the graveyard of favorites today when a nondescript 4-year-old colt named Shadow Caster pulled off a stunning upset to take the 21st running of the Grade II $250,000 Forego Handicap.</p>
        <p>Shadow Caster, at 50-1 the longest shot in a field of 10 top-level sprinters, survived a vicious speed duel with the 2-1 favorite, Richter Scale, and then held off Intidab by a length at the wire. Successful Appeal, the second choice at 5-2, was another nose back in third, as Richter Scale faded to sixth.</p>
        <p>The winning jockey, Jorge Chavez, managed to keep Shadow Caster just off the lead while Richter Scale fired off blistering fractions of 22.71 seconds and 44.37 seconds for the quarter- and half-mile splits. Shadow Caster then put away the favorite in the stretch and covered the six and a half furlongs in 1:15 flat to win for the eighth time in 29 lifetime starts. The colt has won his last three races.</p>
        <p>A Florida-bred son of Future Storm and the Duck Dance mare Just Dance, Shadow Caster's winning time was just three-fifths of a second off the track record, set by Topsider in 1979. Shadow Caster's six-furlong split of 1:08.53 was the fastest six furlongs of the meet this summer, .29 seconds better than the 1:08.82 split run by Chilukki, Bob Baffert's speedy 3-year-old filly, in an allowance race last Friday, in which Chilukki covered six and a half furlongs in 1:15.09.</p>
        <p>In other words, Shadow Caster turned in one of the most impressive performances of the meet this year. Not bad for a chestnut colt whose three previous victories had come in allowance company.</p>
        <p>''I thought I had a chance to at least be in the money today,'' said Chavez, who had not ridden the colt in over a year. ''But I wasn't expecting the colt to be a winner.'' Nor were many others. Shadow Caster paid $103.50 for a $2 bet to win.</p>
        <p>The victory was the trainer John Terranova's second of the day and sixth of the meet. Before this meet, Terranova, who just turned 30, had trained four winners since the beginning of 1999. ''This was definitely the biggest long shot I've ever won with,'' Terranova said. ''Obviously now we've got to think about the Breeders Cup Sprint.''</p>
