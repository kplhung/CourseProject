        <p>THE pin on Mimi Mannix's hat said it all.

        <p>THE pin on Mimi Mannix's hat said it all. ''Junk 'til you drop'' it read, which is why Ms. Mannix -- ''spelled like the detective,'' she said -- was outside the Strudel Haus in Covington, Ky., on a Thursday afternoon painting a giant pig. Like a multitude of less colorful people, Ms. Mannix, an Indiana collectibles dealer, and her capacious yellow porker, a mascot long ago rescued from the roof of a Piggly Wiggly grocery store, had come to this musty little town across the Ohio River from Cincinnati to shop.</p>
        <p>''I'm selling, I'm buying, I'm doing my pig,'' Ms. Mannix said, dipping into a vat of pink enamel. ''I'm having fun.'' Here at the northernmost tip of an annual event known as the 450-Mile Route 127 Corridor Sale, it was no wonder why. A banner spanning Main Street hailed, ''Welcome to the start of the world's largest yard sale.'' On the reverse it said, ''Welcome to the end of the world's largest yard sale.''</p>
        <p>Covington was the final destination if you started your journey at the other end, 450 miles away in Gadsden, Ala. Like everything about this multistate flea market, it was all in how you looked at it.</p>
        <p>The Route 127 Corridor, as this scenically rich, economically underprivileged stretch is called, is not lined with Heywood Wakefield dining room sets and paved with lilac Fiesta Ware. But for a few very busy days every August, there is good junk as far as the eye can see. A 1966 Batman lunchbox for $50, a Shawnee Polynesian lady head vase for $40, a Continental Kilns Bali Hai vegetable bowl for $5, a set of Tiki spice shakers for $6, cartoon figurines from fast-food shops for a quarter. It is as if, for one long weekend a year, the 26th Street Flea Market extended from New York to Toronto.</p>
        <p>For shoppers like my junking buddy, Chuck Hettinger, and me, longtime collectors who live by the words ''Have Bubble Wrap, Will Travel,'' this was a four-day odyssey like no other. Although eBay and a plethora of guidebooks have inflated the prices of collectibles the world over, this rural flea market has not been completely spoiled by price-gouging dealers and pay-anything urban aficionados.</p>
        <p>Trendy collectors -- the internationally known fashion designers, interior decorators and celebrities who frequent the flea markets of Manhattan or Pasadena, Calif. -- were not perusing Covington's card tables. Nor were they pawing the racks at Possum Trot Antiques in Pall Mall, Tenn., a day's drive away and one of the many antique stores dotting the route.</p>
        <p>Instead, Possum Trot's Doris Doss was selling poodle-shaped liquor decanters and lunches of country ham, candied sweet potatoes with toasted marshmallows and slices of ''Million Dollar Pie'' to customers who came from as far away as Canada.</p>
        <p>''What is 'Million Dollar Pie?' '' I asked.</p>
        <p>''It's delicious,'' Mrs. Doss said, her ad-libs as practiced as her baking.</p>
        <p>Fueled by such artery-clogging foods -- not to mention Lee's Famous Fried Chicken, Dairy Queen Blizzard shakes and the home-cooked hamburgers and hot dogs sold from front-lawn barbecues -- we made our way along the mostly two-lane road that snaked through Kentucky and Tennessee. The slow-going drive continued into Georgia and Alabama. But after shopping for 12 hours a day for three days straight, we never made it past Chattanooga, Tenn. By then, we were just too junked out to go any farther than an antiques mall in East Ridge, Tenn.</p>
        <p>Cruising past Baptist churches, double-wide trailers, bright green tobacco fields and solemn graveyards, we stopped our rented minivan every few minutes to browse through wares set out in the driveways of private homes, along sidewalks, in high school parking lots, in former chicken coops and on flatbed trailers parked in muddy fields. A pickup parked on the bank of the Ohio River near the Indiana border produced a 1950's tropical leaf-shaped dish from Hull pottery marked $35.</p>
        <p>''Will you take $20?'' I asked a man who had fashioned his T-shirt into a hat. ''Make it $22, so my wife won't kill me,'' he replied.</p>
        <p>Among the detritus of the 20th century -- from guns to gravy boats -- we perused pressed-glass pitchers, old Louis L'Amour paperbacks, Fire King mugs, Confederate flags, hubcaps and talking Pee-wee Herman dolls who uttered their last ''I know you are, but what am I?'' years ago. Empty Mrs. Butterworth's bottles shared tables with several decades' worth of Kentucky Derby glasses. Barbie dolls in hand-crocheted Southern belle dresses stood next to an unopened box of ''Mork and Mindy'' trading cards from the 1970's. Baby clothes cried out for a new generation of wearers.</p>
        <p>There were some real finds on our trip -- a $10 box of Eva Zeisel Town and Country dishware that might fetch $500 on eBay, for instance. But a lot was the kind of stuff Housing Works would reject as too cruddy to sell in its New York City thrift shops. Still, the pleasure of the world's longest yard sale was in the hunt, the joy of uncovering that one coveted piece that made the trip spiritually, if not economically, worthwhile.</p>
        <p>My accomplice in all this, Chuck, is a decorative painter whose collections include cookie jars, tin noisemakers and Lu-Ray Pastel dishes. For him, the holy grail was a three-foot-tall blown-glass bottle made by a company called Blenko in the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>After looking through hundreds of thousands of items, we felt the junker's tingle in a scraggly crescent of grass and gravel with nothing else even remotely attractive for sale. There we found, lying on its side, the oversized decanter, a giant yellow vessel with its stopper still intact.</p>
        <p>''How much is that big bottle?'' I asked the man standing near it.</p>
        <p>''Oh that's not for sale,'' he said. We hadn't come all this way to hear that.</p>
        <p>''If it's not for sale, why is it here?'' Chuck asked.</p>
        <p>The man explained that he had bought the bottle that morning for $25, and didn't want to part with it. ''I'll give you $50,'' Chuck said.</p>
        <p>No thanks, the man replied. And on it went, $75, $100, finally $125.</p>
        <p>That was the magic number. ''I can't say no to making a hundred dollars,'' the man said. A few minutes later, I overheard one female shopper say to another, ''That guy must know something if he's willing to spend that much for a bottle.''</p>
        <p>We both did. Chuck knew a similar Blenko bottle recently sold on eBay for close to $1,000. I knew I didn't want to be in that minivan if the guy had refused to sell it to Chuck.</p>
        <p>Steals like that one, we've since been told, have gotten fewer and farther between as the sale has grown. ''Four years ago, before eBay, there was a lot more collectible stuff for a quarter,'' said Ryan Lance, a proprietor of a store called Howdy Do on East Seventh Street in Manhattan, which sells campy pop culture items like ''Cher's Dressing Room Play Set'' and ''H. R. Pufnstuf'' coloring books.</p>
        <p>Programs like ''Antiques Roadshow'' and published guides to all types of collectibles have helped to jack up prices, too, he said. ''I saw a rusted-out, horrible old 'Charlie's Angels' lunchbox -- the handle was half melted -- and the lady had $95 on it,'' Mr. Lance said. ''I asked her, 'Why is it this much?' and she said, 'That's what it books for.' ''</p>
        <p>His partner, Michael Torres, added, ''People this year were much more aware of what they have in their homes and in their basements.''</p>
        <p>But at least one thing hasn't changed: The so-bad-it's-good aesthetic hasn't reached these parts yet. ''The people down there don't appreciate black velvet paintings,'' Mr. Lance noted. ''They're $3 apiece there and we can get $75 here. What's sad is that people probably took them down off their walls for the sale.''</p>
        <p>For those who live in these economically depressed environs -- particularly junk dealers, restaurant operators and motel owners -- the Route 127 sale is a significant source of income. ''This is by far the biggest week of the year here,'' said Scott Sandman, executive director of the Jamestown, Tenn., Chamber of Commerce, which promotes the event. ''There are sellers who make 8 or 10 thousand dollars in these four days,'' he said. The median household income in 1999 for Fentress County, Tenn., was $21,293.</p>
        <p>As Mrs. Doss of Possum Trot Antiques said, ''In four days, we do what we usually do in two months.''</p>
        <p>Debbie Barnett, who owns the County Line Antiques Mall in Lawrenceburg, Ky., said, ''People buy for it all year long, box it up and store it until 127.'' She sees 50 to 100 customers on a typical day. During the sale, she estimated that 2,500 people a day browsed through her bric-a-brac. It is so busy, in fact, that she never leaves the store during the four-day yard sale, sleeping on a cot rather than going home to Lexington, which is a half-hour away.</p>
        <p>''Last year we had people peeking in the door at 6:30 a.m.,'' she said. ''And we stay open until they stop coming.'' That may be as late as midnight.</p>
        <p>Started more than a dozen years ago, the giant yard sale has grown since the days when a former county executive named Mike Walker, a lawyer in Jamestown, came up with the idea of a crafts sale to lure tourists off the interstate. ''The first year, we put out crafts and didn't sell anything,'' Mrs. Doss said. ''But after that we put out junk and whatnot and it sold.''</p>
        <p>THE Route 127 Corridor Sale is no longer much of a secret. On June 14, HGTV, the home and garden cable channel, presented a one-hour documentary called ''The Longest Yard Sale.'' ''They aired that special on a Wednesday, and the next day, the phones wouldn't quit,'' Mr. Sandman said. ''We had 400 calls.''</p>
        <p>One was from Allen Holladay, a machinist from Rock Island, Ill. He and his girlfriend, Lori Bitterman, a nursing instructor, had driven 750 miles from home when I caught up with them, near the Isaac Shelby Cemetery State Historic Site, seven miles northwest of Stanford, Ky. ''We were sitting watching the Home and Garden network and heard about this,'' Mr. Holladay said. ''We hadn't planned a vacation, so we decided to come here.''</p>
        <p>The couple were carting furniture home in a blue van with an open trailer attached. ''It looks like the Beverly Hillbillies,'' he admitted.</p>
        <p>For next summer, PBS plans to show ''A Flea Market Documentary,'' another special featuring the Route 127 sale. At the Lake Cumberland Motel in Jamestown, Ky., Rick Sebak, a bearish television producer with a jovial demeanor, was conducting interviews for it. Mr. Sebak, who produced the critically lauded PBS specials ''An Ice Cream Show'' and ''A Hot Dog Program,'' said that he and his crew ''have been totally flabbergasted by it all.''</p>
        <p>''It's better than we expected,'' he said. ''In rural Kentucky and Tennessee, there's still cool stuff left in people's houses.''</p>
        <p>Not for long, perhaps. But for now, the sale still has the feeling that around the next corner will be another Blenko bottle, another 60's lunchbox in fabulous condition and another woman painting a giant pig. When I think of Ms. Mannix back in Covington pointing to her hat, I laugh.</p>
        <p>''See this button?'' she asked. ''It says, 'Don't pay department store prices.' I raised four kids on yard sales.''</p>
        <p>Then, as she had probably done at least a hundred times before, Ms. Mannix went into a story about the time she dressed the giant pig up as Zsa Zsa Gabor and took him to the Queen Kumquat Sashay in Orlando, Fla.</p>
        <p>The story was free. No purchase required.</p>
