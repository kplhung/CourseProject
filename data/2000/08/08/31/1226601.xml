        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>GORE RETAINS MOMENTUM -- Vice President Al Gore is still enjoying a postconvention bounce in presidential preference polls. Mr. Gore has taken a 15-point lead over Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in Maryland, an 8-point lead in Florida, a 5-point lead in Illinois and has closed to within 4 points in New Hampshire. In Maryland, according to a Gonzales-Arscott poll of 649 registered voters taken Wednesday through Sunday, Mr. Gore leads 51 percent to 36 percent, while in Florida, according to a Rasmussen Research poll of 439 voters conducted Saturday and Sunday, he leads 48 percent to 40 percent. In Illinois, a Mason-Dixon poll of 629 voters taken Thursday through Sunday showed Mr. Gore ahead of Mr. Bush 46 percent to 41 percent, while in a New Hampshire poll, covering 540 registered voters and conducted Thursday through Saturday, Mr. Bush retained a lead of 48 percent to 44 percent. The margin of sampling error for the new Florida poll was plus or minus five points. In the three other polls it was plus or minus four percentage points.</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>NADER WINS UNION BACKING -- The news is good and bad this week for Ralph Nader, the Green Party's presidential candidate. On Wednesday in Erie, Pa., Mr. Nader won the endorsement of the 35,000-member United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, after telling the union's convention that while the Democratic Party might be labor's traditional political partner in presidential races, it always promised more than it delivered. He promised to deliver. The union seldom endorses presidential candidates. But there was bad political news for Mr. Nader on Tuesday in South Dakota, where he had missed the June 20 filing deadline for getting on the fall ballot and had been trying to persuade a judge that he should be listed anyway. The judge turned him down. Also, in Wyoming on Tuesday, state election officials said that Mr. Nader would not be on the fall ballot there because he fell short of the 3,584 signatures needed to qualify. One reason he fell short was that a volunteer walked off with a petition containing 650 signatures.</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>CANDIDATE FEUD UNRESOLVED -- A federal judge in Lynchburg, Va., ruled yesterday that he did not have jurisdiction to decide the bitter feud over who is the Reform Party's presidential nominee. Allies of one candidate, Patrick J. Buchanan, sought an order barring a competing faction from operating under the party's name. But Judge Norman K. Moon of Federal District Court, who has heard other Reform Party disputes, said he lacked jurisdiction in this instance because the power struggle did not raise any constitutional issue. At the party's convention in Long Beach, Calif., earlier this month, delegates opposed to Mr. Buchanan declared his nomination illegal and walked out, asserting that he had packed the convention with hard-right followers who were not qualified delegates. The rump group then held its own convention across the street and nominated John Hagelin, a physicist from Iowa. Both sides are seeking $12.6 million in Federal Election Commission money and competing to get sole billing on state ballots. Buchanan officials said they would next try a state court.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>BATTLE OF THE ADS -- With just three weeks to go before the Democratic primary in Washington State, Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn has unveiled her television advertising campaign for the United States Senate nomination. Ms. Senn accuses her better-financed opponent, former Representative Maria Cantwell, of dodging debates and ''hiding in a TV'' via her own commercials. Ms. Cantwell, who became a millionaire several times over as an Internet executive after being turned out of office in the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress, has been showing advertisements throughout the summer, pointing out her business experience and other credentials and all but ignoring Ms. Senn. Some polls have shown Ms. Cantwell well in front, but Ms. Senn says those polls demonstrated only name recognition, not popular support. The winner of the Sept. 19 primary will face the Republican incumbent, Senator Slade Gorton.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>SIGN OF THE TIMES -- It was bound to happen. On Tuesday, at a late night rally in downtown Portland, Ore., Vice President Al Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman (did we mention that he's Jewish), were greeted by supporters waving placards that spelled out Gore-Lieberman in Hebrew letters. It should be noted, however, that the signs said ''Gore-Lieberman 2000,'' not Gore-Lieberman 5761, the date of the coming election in the Hebrew calendar.</p>

        <p>THE INTEREST GROUPS</p>
        <p>ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDS AND FOES -- The Sierra Club has returned to the airwaves in seven states with television and radio commercials praising a few Republicans and many more Democrats on many environmental issues. One radio spot in the $8 million campaign praises a Republican and a Democrat -- each of whom represent districts served by stations in the Quad Cities area of Illinois and Iowa. Listeners are asked to thank Representatives Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, and Lane Evans, Democrat of Illinois, for supporting higher standards on arsenic in drinking water. The advertisements, which will run for about two weeks, are costing the Sierra Club more than $200,000, said Dan Weiss, the group's political director. Positive advertisements will be broadcast about Representatives Mark Udall of Colorado, Joseph M. Hoeffel of Pennsylvania and Brian Baird of Washington, all Democrats. Radio commercials will support Senators James M. Jeffords of Vermont and William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, both Republicans, along with three Democratic Representatives, Rush D. Holt of New Jersey and Jay Inslee and Adam Smith, both of Washington. Critical advertisements are being run against two Republicans, Senator Slade Gorton of Washington and former Gov. George Allen of Virginia, a Senate hopeful.</p>
