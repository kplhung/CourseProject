        <p>SOME games are so original or technically innovative or visually powerful that the game world is never quite the same. Games like Doom, Myst and Sim City are not only fondly remembered but are still played. But there are other entertaining games that are forgotten almost as soon as they are played.

        <p>SOME games are so original or technically innovative or visually powerful that the game world is never quite the same. Games like Doom, Myst and Sim City are not only fondly remembered but are still played. But there are other entertaining games that are forgotten almost as soon as they are played. If there are B movies, then these are B games.</p>
        <p>Two such games are Kiss Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child, an action game based on the Kiss Psycho Circus comic books, which are inspired by the rock band Kiss, and Dracula Resurrection, an adventure game.</p>
        <p>Although Nightmare Child combines three things that have been blamed for the degeneration of America's youth, it is unlikely to have parents up in arms. You don't shoot anything human in this game. Your foes are mutant circus freaks: clowns with spidery metallic legs, strongmen with weights grafted to their arms, human balloons who spit poisonous gas.</p>
        <p>And although the game is quite violent, it seems harmless compared with the more sadistic Soldier of Fortune or Kingpin.</p>
        <p>The framework is silly but functional. The members of Kiss arrive without makeup to play a concert but  find themselves confronted by a fortuneteller who demands that they save the world from a ''nightmare child'' that is approaching consciousness.</p>
        <p>The setup is reminiscent of an episode of ''The Monkees'' or ''Scooby-Doo,'' only here each band member is fitted out with artillery and must seek out supernatural armor that will both give him extraordinary powers and make him look just like his stage persona in Kiss.</p>
        <p>The most interesting element of Nightmare Child is its circus motif. There is a perverse, comic-book feel to enemies like an evil clown throwing deadly juggling clubs or a zombie fat lady throwing globs of toxic cellulite. If the rest of the game had shown as much originality, Nightmare Child could have truly been memorable.</p>
        <p>But coming on the heels of a string of games like Half-Life and Deus Ex, which have expanded the concept of what a good action game should be, Nightmare Child's old-fashioned plotless killfest seems hollow, like mayhem without context, violence without purpose. Nightmare Child is a throwback to a time when killing was enough.</p>
        <p>In spite of the Kiss tie-in, Nightmare Child has little rock flavor. You may come across a jukebox playing a Kiss song, but the score is a fairly standard: no screaming guitars, no hoarse vocals. The game might have been more interesting if it had been as over the top as the band.</p>
        <p>Nightmare Child can be a lot of fun at times, and some confrontations are very exciting. But as you have to blast away at yet another monster-spawning machine spitting out yet another horde of headless bugs, it becomes increasingly hard to stay interested. The game's lack of fresh ideas makes it exciting for only half of the 40 or so hours it takes to play it.</p>
        <p>Dracula Resurrection, on the other hand, is less likely to wear out its welcome. It can be finished by any experienced gamer in 10 hours or so, hardly enough time to get bored. Like Nightmare Child, Resurrection is good-looking and unoriginal. The puzzles are unexceptional in design and ingenuity and are truly notable only for their remarkable lack of challenge.</p>
        <p>But, like Nightmare Child, Resurrection has a certain B-game charm. Much of the game feels like an old Dracula movies with Christopher Lee: fearful villagers, sinister demons, a damsel in distress. Every time you solve a puzzle, the game moves forward with a brief animated scene. It was as if a projectionist kept stopping the movie to ask you simple riddles, then showed you a little more once you had answered.</p>
        <p>The scenes are enjoyable: a frightened innkeeper warning of danger while you study the veins in her nose, or a trio of half-naked female vampires who threaten you while doing turns and cartwheels that suggest they are planning to take their act to Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Resurrection has puzzle-design flaws common among adventure games, but it never mires the player in an insoluble muddle. Some puzzles provide insufficient clues and one must use trial and error, but the choices are limited enough that a trial-and-error approach can be done quickly. Sometimes an important item is barely visible, but the player can find everything because the game is compartmentalized into small discrete spaces that limit the area you have to search.</p>
        <p>Resurrection may not have any exciting puzzles, but it is also free of puzzles that will send you into a blind rage. If you have never played an adventure game, Resurrection might be a good place to start. If you can't get through this one, there's not much point in going out and buying something difficult like Grim Fandango.</p>
        <p>Sometimes a B movie can be more fun than a Hollywood epic. One does not always want to be challenged, t forced to think or confronted by something new and unexpected. The same is true of games, where originality can be both exhilarating and exhausting.</p>
        <p>Nightmare Child and Resurrection are games designed to give you a little fun without disturbing the status quo, and they are successful in doing that. They are as simple to play as they are easy to forget.</p>
