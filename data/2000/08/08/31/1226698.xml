        <p>Coach Clive Charles yesterday filled the final two vacancies on his 18-man roster for the Summer Olympics in Australia, naming the United States national team goalkeeper Brad Friedel and the Los Angeles Galaxy rookie midfielder Sasha Victorine to the team.</p>
        <p>The two players replace the injured goalkeeper Aiden Brown (Colorado Rapids) and midfielder Chris Armas (Chicago Fire). Friedel joins the team as one of three over-age players.

        <p>Coach Clive Charles yesterday filled the final two vacancies on his 18-man roster for the Summer Olympics in Australia, naming the United States national team goalkeeper Brad Friedel and the Los Angeles Galaxy rookie midfielder Sasha Victorine to the team.</p>
        <p>The two players replace the injured goalkeeper Aiden Brown (Colorado Rapids) and midfielder Chris Armas (Chicago Fire). Friedel joins the team as one of three over-age players. The Olympic event is for players under 23 years old, except for three over-age players (Jeff Agoos and Frankie Hejduk are the other two).</p>
        <p>The addition of Friedel means that Tim Howard, who plays for the MetroStars, is not likely to start for the United States. Howard, who is now the MetroStars' starter because Mike Ammann is injured, will join the Olympic team after Saturday's match against Miami in Florida.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to second-guess Clive, but we believe that Timmy is clearly ready for the big time,'' General Manager Nick Sakiewicz of the MetroStars said yesterday. ''He has proved that he is capable of starting for the Olympic team. I feel that the Olympic team is not as strong if he doesn't play.''</p>
        <p>Friedel, who played sparingly last season in England for Liverpool and played for the United States national team in its 7-0 victory in a World Cup qualifier against Barbados on Aug. 16, will likely be the starter for the Americans in Australia (the United States opens against the Czech Republic on Sept. 13). The situation leaves the MetroStars without a proven player in goal as the playoffs approach, beginning on Sept. 15 at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>''Timmy is not leaving us in the lurch,'' Sakiewicz said. ''We can win and it's not about the vacancy in goal. We made it clear to Tim that we would not make the decision for him. He has an absolute green light to do what he wants. This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.''</p>
