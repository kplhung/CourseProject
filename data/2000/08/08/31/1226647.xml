        <p>A Government for Somalia  Somalia's first president in nearly a decade, Abdikassim Salad Hassan, arrived safely in Mogadishu, escorted by more than 1,000 armed militiamen and greeted by tens of thousands of joyous Somalis, despite worry over threats by the warlords who have ruled for the last nine years.</p>

        <p>Suharto Pleads Illness  The former Indonesian leader was absent from the opening of his corruption trial in Jakarta today. Lawyers for the 79-year-old former president said doctors examined him this morning and had found him too ill to attend. The announcement was not unanticipated.</p>

        <p>Kidnappers Suggest Talks  A member of the Muslim rebel faction that kidnapped an American in the southern Philippines this week told a radio station that the rebels were prepared to talk with the United States, but only if China, Iraq, Libya and North Korea also took part. On the other hand, the rebel said, ''Maybe we will behead him.'' A State Department spokesman ruled out negotiations.</p>

        <p>Koreas to Allow More Reunions  South and North Korea agreed in principle to allow more reunions of long-separated families and to take other steps toward ending decades of animosity, news reports said.

        <p>Cheney Asserts Clinton Mishandled the Military  Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential candidate and former defense secretary, delivered a harsh assessment of the condition of the armed forces under President Clinton, accusing him, and by association Vice President Al Gore, of ''running down'' a military that succeeded in recent conflicts only because of the military build-up of Republican administrations. He said the military is stretched over too many theaters and is hampered by low morale, low pay, inadequate training and unreliable weapons and equipment.</p>
