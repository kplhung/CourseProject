      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Geraldo Rivera wants to run for mayor of New York City and he does not mind if that makes people laugh.</p>
        <p>''I expect the first reaction to be,  'Geraldo as mayor, ha ha,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rivera, the longtime television journalist who is anchor of a talk show on CNBC, said yesterday that he was completely serious about pursuing an independent campaign for mayor, after a petition drive to get his name on the ballot, a campaign that he said would be ''totally self-financed'' -- even if it costs $5 million to $10 million.</p>
        <p>The campaign is ''just an exploration'' now, Mr. Rivera said. He said he was considering commissioning a poll to determine his chances. As for qualifications, Mr. Rivera cited his long career covering issues of relevance to the city, his background as a lawyer, and, as he put it: ''My whole gene pool is New York. I'm Puerto Rican and Jewish.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera's proposed candidacy harks back to a long New York tradition of media figures' seeking to run for City Hall, reaching at least as far back as the newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst in 1905 and including efforts by William F. Buckley Jr., the conservative writer and talk show host, in 1965 and the novelist Norman Mailer in 1969.</p>
        <p>Of course, they all lost.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera would prefer a different comparison. ''I think Jesse Ventura comes much closer to what I want to do: a truly independent campaign from a political outsider with a serious agenda.'' He said he would not enter the primaries or try to win the nomination of any political party.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Rivera, who had lived in New Jersey but has returned to Manhattan, said he was convinced the city needed ''a way to come back together.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera criticized what he called ''the tactics of Mayor Giuliani,'' which Mr. Rivera said had led to ''minority mothers' having more fear for their children from a cop than a crook.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera acknowledged that his often made-for-tabloid personal history, which has included multiple romantic liaisons and public fistfights, could pose problems. But he said he had sought redemption the last several years in serious journalism for CNBC and NBC News. ''I think I've succeeded,'' he said. ''I defy anyone to debate me on any issue of consequence to New York.''</p>
        <p>One question left unanswered: Would it be Mayor Rivera or Mayor Geraldo? Mr. Rivera said, ''Like Elvis and Lassie and Oprah, I have one-name recognition.''</p>
