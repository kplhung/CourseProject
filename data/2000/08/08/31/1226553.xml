        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As the daughter of a survivor -- my father spent six years as a prisoner in a Siberian labor camp during World War II -- I often wonder how I would fare in a similar situation. Would I help my fellow prisoners? Would I look after only myself? These thoughts are followed by gratitude that I haven't been tested in this way, and I hope I never will be.</p>

        <p>So I read about ''Survivor'' (front page, Aug. 24) and wondered how our culture has gotten to the point where this is entertainment. Watching a group of people stay alive first by working as a team and then by working against each other shouldn't send the message that the survivor ''wins'' but that we're perpetuating behavior that is dehumanizing and repressive.</p>
