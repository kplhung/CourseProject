        <p>As students returned to Seton Hall University for the fall semester, university officials were still working yesterday to resolve safety violations arising from the dormitory fire that killed 3 students and injured 58 others last January.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of fire-code violations were found shortly after the fire, and Seton Hall was fined $12,600 last month by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration for failing to have a plan in place to protect its workers in case of fire. University officials pledged yesterday to correct all safety problems by next Wednesday, the first day of classes.</p>
        <p>And at an assembly for freshmen yesterday, officials at the campus, in South Orange, N.J., explained new, stricter policies to prevent fires:  students who start a fire, tamper with a fire safety device or create any other hazardous situation related to a fire will be removed from university housing immediately, face a minimum fine of $500 and eight hours of community service and possible criminal charges.</p>
        <p>''The school's gone over the policies with us and they are strict, so I feel safe even though I'm living where the fire took place,'' said Olkeriil Kazuo, 18, a freshman who will live on the third floor of Boland Hall, where the fire started.</p>
        <p>''They assured us that something like this could never happen again,'' said Mr. Kazuo, a business major from the Pacific Island nation of Palau.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kazuo, who will room with his cousin, Shalom Ettison, 19, also a business major, said that the first-year students at the assembly were curious about the predawn fire earlier this year, but that officials wanted to talk only about the future.</p>
        <p>''They talked to us about procedure and safety,'' he said, ''but they did not talk about the fire itself,'' whose cause has never been determined.</p>
        <p>The violations cited by OSHA, which were reported by The Star-Ledger of Newark yesterday, were in addition to the more than 800 fire-code violations cited by the State Department of Community Affairs  six months ago in an inspection just after the fire, which were for problems like unsafe extension cords and missing fire extinguishers.</p>
        <p>OSHA issued its two fire-related citations against Seton Hall after the six-month investigation determined that the university did not have a plan for employees to respond safely to fire alarms. Investigators also found that university officials had not assessed the type of protective gear employees might need during a fire.</p>
        <p>Those violations were classified as serious, meaning that there was ''a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result,'' university officials said.</p>
        <p>The serious violations cited by OSHA carry maximum fines of $7,000 each. Seton Hall has no record of previous OSHA violations, university officials said.</p>
        <p>''We have been working with OSHA and all the citations have been abated,'' said Laurie Pine, a spokeswoman for Seton Hall. ''We do not anticipate any further problems.''</p>
        <p>Before the fire, about a third of the university's dormitory rooms had sprinklers. This summer, Seton Hall  began a four-year program to install sprinklers in the rest of the rooms.</p>
        <p>The fire prompted changes even beyond Seton Hall to help prevent such tragedies. In June, the State Legislature approved a bill requiring all college and boarding school dormitory rooms in New Jersey to be fitted with sprinklers within four years, and provided $90 million to help pay for them.</p>
        <p>As part of its new fire safety procedures, the university has required resident assistants to attend fire-safety training, officials said.</p>
        <p>Some students said they were glad federal and state officials were requiring Seton Hall to make changes.</p>
        <p>''They should have to pay that,''  Helga Santana, a nursing student, said about the fines. ''But even that is not enough.''</p>
