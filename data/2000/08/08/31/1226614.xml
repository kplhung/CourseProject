        <p>''We have no military objective,'' President Clinton told the Colombian people in a passionate television address on the eve of his one-day visit here today. ''We do not believe your conflict has a military solution. Our approach is both pro-peace and anti-drug.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton did everything he could today to dispel the notion that the United States is about to slip into the morass of another jungle war like El Salvador, or worse yet, Vietnam. Colombian officials invited him to visit a naval base involved in drug interdiction, but instead he chose to visit a neighborhood justice center, to show the humane side of United States aid.</p>
        <p>But it is one thing to engage in photo-ops during an eight-hour trip to this city, a Caribbean tourist center far from any fighting; it is quite another to help the Colombian government to retake control of the half of its territory that has been lost to Marxist guerrillas who are in league with coca growers and drug traffickers.</p>
        <p>Drugs are so lucrative, they cannot be easily separated from a tangle of treacherous risks that will face any growing United States involvement in Colombia.</p>
        <p>The production and trafficking of cocaine and heroin touch and corrupt the country's judicial system, politics and economics, and they fuel not only a growing guerrilla movement but also a brutal paramilitary movement loosely linked to local military units.</p>
        <p>President Clinton's trip here is effectively a colorful handoff of a check for $1.3 billion in mostly military aid recently approved by Congress. An anti-drug brigade will soon begin backing police efforts to eradicate coca fields in two southern provinces largely controlled by Colombia's most powerful guerrilla group. The 60 helicopters included in the package are to be used only for anti-drug efforts, unless military units fighting drugs are attacked by the guerrillas.</p>
        <p>This plan, according to United States officials, is nothing more than a fight against drugs that are subverting Colombia's democracy and poisoning youths across the United States. In all likelihood, no United States troops will be engaged in the fighting because there is no desire for that in Congress and because the Pentagon has shown no enthusiasm for a deepening involvement, in contrast to the early days of Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the program is a sharp break from past policy. Washington treated the last president of Colombia as a pariah -- refusing even to grant him a visa -- when it was discovered that his campaign accepted a $6 million contribution from the Cali drug cartel. Washington for years snubbed the armed forces, and funneled most aid to the national police, after military commanders protected leaders of the Medellin drug cartel in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The change in policy requires some nose-holding, even though President Andres Pastrana is considered a well-intentioned reformer.</p>
        <p>Before a single helicopter has arrived, President Clinton had to waive on national security grounds the human rights amendments Congress had added to the program. The decision was an acknowledgement that the United States must put up with rights offenses that might otherwise be considered intolerable. Any other decision would have undermined the new program before it even got started, and human rights concerns are not likely to derail what promises to be a long-term involvement.</p>
        <p>It was much the same when President Ronald Reagan repeatedly overlooked the human rights violations of El Salvador's military and Nicaragua's Contras to keep his Central America program going.</p>
        <p>The guerrillas here are not nearly as formidable as were the Vietcong or even the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front of El Salvador. With the cold war over, Communism is no longer a threat, United States officials admit, and the guerrillas who have fought here for the last 40 years no longer can count on the help of Moscow or Havana. And according to opinion polls, they have the support of less than 5 percent of the people.</p>
        <p>The most important support the Colombian guerrillas have going for them, say most analysts, is a ready gold mine of drug protection money estimated at several hundred million dollars a year. That is enough to keep them well equipped, well fed, and unenthusiastic about making peace.</p>
        <p>Critics of the aid program say it is designed in Washington to meet domestic political concerns in the United States and has no relevancy to the reality in Colombia.</p>
        <p>''There is no way to sustain the distinction between drug traffickers and guerrillas in southern Colombia,'' said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of Miami. ''U.S. policy will break down the first day.''</p>
        <p>Colombian officials disagree, saying the plan will ultimately destroy the guerrillas' capacity to make war.</p>
        <p>''It's not a matter of Marxist philosophy anymore; the guerrillas are now in the fight for the money,'' General Fernando Tapias, commander of the armed forces, said in a recent interview. ''The plan for peace will not work without a decisive fight against drugs.''</p>
        <p>But the armed forces here remain small, under-equipped, under trained, lacking in intelligence-gathering capabilities and lacking in mobility even with the new helicopters. It took a decade to rebuild the Salvadoran Army, and the United States effort to do the same in Colombia is not a short-term project either, as United States officials concede.</p>
        <p>Those deficiencies make a long war likely.</p>
        <p>What does Washington do if the guerrillas shoot at the helicopters, or worse yet at the United States military trainers working with the new anti-drug brigade? What if the guerrillas and the coca growers and drug traffickers simply move from the two southern provinces and spread the war to other Colombian provinces or even neighboring countries like Peru and Brazil?</p>
        <p>Either President Al Gore or President George W. Bush may well have to face those contingencies, and the options they will have to choose from will not be easy.</p>
