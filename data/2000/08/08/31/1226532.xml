        <p>IF you can't be with the one you love, get a Webcam.</p>
        <p>At least, that's what Simon Wong, an engineer in California, and Chiunwei Shu, a student in Arizona, have done to make it easier to live in different states and still date each other.

        <p>IF you can't be with the one you love, get a Webcam.</p>
        <p>At least, that's what Simon Wong, an engineer in California, and Chiunwei Shu, a student in Arizona, have done to make it easier to live in different states and still date each other. Mr. Wong and Ms. Shu, who met when Ms. Shu was visiting California, say they spend at least two hours every night with their Webcams trained on their bedrooms.</p>
        <p>''It's cool,'' Mr. Wong said. ''I'll be at home watching TV -- and she's not here, so we can't hang out -- and she'll be at home doing her thing, reading a book, and I can check out what she's doing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Shu agreed. ''If I'm studying, it's not bothering me,'' she said. ''But we can both look up and smile at each other.''</p>
        <p>High-tech communication isn't just giving e-commerce a global outlook or letting adolescent gamers shoot at one another across town or across the country. Tools like instant messages, videoconferencing software, Web phones and wireless communications are making it easier to keep love alive in long-distance relationships.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wong and Ms. Shu use NetMeeting, Microsoft's videoconferencing program, to gaze adoringly at each other over the Internet while they talk.</p>
        <p>They also keep in touch via instant messages and daily e-mail notes, usually with photos. Ms. Shu said she took a picture of herself and sent it to Mr. Wong every day so he could keep up to date on whether she looked happy, sad or stressed. But aside from that analogue standby, the phone, videoconferencing is their favorite means of communication.</p>
        <p>''If it weren't for the Internet,'' Mr. Wong said, ''we wouldn't spend the same percentage of the day communicating -- you simply can't talk on the phone all the time. But it's easy to spend two hours on NetMeeting. It actually feels like we hang out all the time.'' There is an added benefit, Mr. Wong said, laughing: ''If the phone rings on her side, I can still play the jealous boyfriend,'' he said. ''Like, 'Who's calling you?' Or if we're talking, I can see her expression -- if she looks bored, I can say, 'Are you really interested in this conversation?' ''</p>
        <p>Prentice Welch and Erika Lam, both 24, are old hands at using technology to keep in touch while they are apart. They have been sweethearts since high school but in 1997, Ms. Lam moved to Costa Rica for a year of college while Mr. Welch stayed in Davis, Calif. ''That was before we knew about instant messaging,'' Ms. Lam said.</p>
        <p>The two kept in touch by sending e-mail  almost every day. Ms. Lam used an online florist to send Mr. Welch flowers, and he sent her the Web address for his basketball league's site so she could keep up with his games. (But she didn't check. ''It took too long,'' she explained).</p>
        <p>Two years later, Mr. Welch moved to Beijing for the school year while Ms. Lam stayed in San Francisco. This time, instant messaging was more common, and they started doing that right away.</p>
        <p>''That was huge to be able to chat live,'' said Mr. Welch, now a computer operator in San Francisco, where he and Ms. Shu share a home. ''We'd set up dates, when we'd meet online every other day. And sometimes I'd be online, sitting in a cafe in Beijing, and we'd bump into each other. That was so cool.''</p>
        <p>Long-distance romance over the Web is not all sweetness and light. For one thing, annoying technical glitches sometimes crop up. Mr. Wong said that he and Ms. Shu sometimes spent an hour or two trying to get the software to work, to no avail. ''Then it's like spending time on the relationship that ends up not being time spent together,'' Mr. Wong said.</p>
        <p>The technology can be distracting, he added. ''Sometimes focusing on this little screen image distracts from the conversation,'' he said. ''It's not as real.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lam and Mr. Welch said that while instant messaging had helped them stay in touch, high-tech communication could make things harder. Ms. Lam said that conflict over international data lines could be hard to manage. ''An argument in cyberspace is the worst,'' she said. ''You never get a feeling of resolution.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch agreed. ''And when we'd get in fights -- as much of a fight as you can have typing rapidly at each other -- she'd always win because she can type faster,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The limits of the technology could prove frustrating. ''Sometimes it made me want to cry,'' Ms. Lam said. ''It was like, I can't touch you through the screen.''</p>
        <p>Both agreed that even though they felt connected when they were online, they had become lonely as soon as they turned away from the computer.</p>
        <p>''I'd be in some smoky Internet cafe,'' Mr. Welch said with melancholy in his voice.</p>
        <p>''And I'd be alone in my dark room,'' Ms. Lam said with a shudder.</p>
        <p>They resolved that problem when Ms. Lam moved to Beijing to be with Mr. Welch after a five-month separation. The couple are expecting their first child in October, and they say their days of Internet connections are behind them. ''Next time we go somewhere,'' Mr. Welch said as he took Ms. Lam's hand, ''we'll go together.''</p>
        <p>For some people, the problem is not maintaining a relationship, but ending one. Ask Sun Kim, a 24-year-old research associate in a San Francisco cardiology laboratory. When her boyfriend moved to Korea last December for a consulting job, the two decided not to keep dating long distance but resolved to stay friends.</p>
        <p>That, however, proved more difficult than it sounded. ''While we were dating,'' Ms. Kim said, ''he was really good at e-mailing. He worked in a dot-com and sat around in a cubicle and e-mailed me every day. He sent messages, stuff he found on the Internet, and he was the king of Egreetings.'' (Egreetings.com is an online greeting-card service.) When he moved to Korea, nothing changed.</p>
        <p>''It was bad because we were supposed to be broken up,'' Ms. Kim said, ''but he'd send flirty e-mails and use Net phones to call me from Korea -- for free -- all the time.'' She said her ex-boyfriend had also beamed a PocketSutra, a copy of the Kama Sutra, to her Handspring Visor.</p>
        <p>''Geographically,'' Ms. Kim said, ''the relationship changed, but most of it stayed the same through technology. It was like it was before, only I never saw him anymore. It was like, 'We're just friends, but I'm still going to be your virtual boyfriend.' ''</p>
        <p>Frequent instant messaging, or I.M., sessions made the relationship drag out for months, Ms. Kim said, even though they were continents apart. ''About six months after he left,'' Ms. Kim said, ''I was ready to date other people. I told him that, and it turned into this big 'define the relationship' discussion over I.M.''</p>
        <p>The time lag between replies opened up room for confusion. ''I'd ask a question,'' Ms. Kim said, ''and he wouldn't respond right away, and I'd wonder: Is he offended? Away from his desk? Working?''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Ms. Kim said she thought that her former boyfriend preferred the medium -- lag time or no -- to face-to-face discussion. ''At one point in this weird breakup discussion over instant messaging,'' she said, ''I said, 'You're probably so relieved we're doing this over I.M.,' and he said, 'Yeah, I am, actually.'</p>
        <p>''Finally, I told him: 'I think it would be a good idea if we don't communicate like this anymore. Call me on the phone or don't contact me.' There was no response, so I logged off. He called a few days later, and he hadn't gotten the message. His Yahoo Messenger had been logging him on and off so he never got my message. He thought everything was fine.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''It's hard to convey emotions over I.M. If you're mad, it's hard to convey that in your tone without coming right out and saying, 'I'm mad at you.' ''</p>
        <p>''In general,'' she said, ''technology makes it hard to have an old-fashioned breakup, where you never see or speak to each other again. I kind of miss the old-fashioned breakup.''</p>
