        <p>MOST Americans view the immigrant experience through the bold strokes of struggle and assimilation. They barely notice the underside of immigration -- the rules for inspecting, admitting and excluding newcomers to American shores. For much of American history, this process was handled by state and local authorities. But that changed in the 1890's, when Congress, worried by a flood of immigrants from central and southern Europe, gave the federal government complete jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>Laws were passed excluding immigrants with a criminal past, a mental deficiency, or a communicable disease. The Bureau of Immigration was created, along with 24 federal inspection stations, to process new arrivals and weed out those deemed medically suspect, politically subversive, or unlikely to find a job.</p>
        <p>For the immigrants who came through New York harbor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Statue of Liberty no doubt dazzled their senses, but Ellis Island determined their fate. Opened on Jan. 1, 1892, Ellis Island's vast inspection center served as the entry point for more than 10 million men, women and children, mostly European Catholics and Jews. In the busiest years, between 1898 and 1915, its overburdened staff processed 5,000 people a day with cold, stunning efficiency.</p>
        <p>The CD-ROM ''The Ellis Island Experience'' begins slowly. Its opening section, ''The Old World,'' is a collection of essays about the conditions in 19th century Europe -- industrialization, political upheaval, religious persecution -- that led millions to flee the continent.</p>
        <p>Left largely unexplored is how these people chose America, and what they hoped to find. Why, for example, did some immigrant groups see the United States as their final destination while others traveled back and forth between the continents, often dozens of times. And why did millions of immigrants bypass our shores entirely to settle in countries like Australia, Canada, Argentina and Brazil?</p>
        <p>More surprising is the failure of ''The Ellis Island Experience'' to emphasize the changing dynamic of immigration. In the 1890's, Americans grew uneasy about the enormous flow of immigrants from places like Greece, Italy, Russia, Poland and Hungary. Without new safeguards, they believed, these immigrants would pollute the nation with a stream of alien blood. Ellis Island was a logical response.</p>
        <p>The key sections of this CD-ROM -- ''The Journey'' and ''The Golden Door'' -- are very well done. Combining videos, photographs, primary documents and crisp commentary, they follow the immigrant path from the tiny villages of Europe to the controlled chaos of Ellis Island. Viewers should have no trouble navigating along. There is an adequate search function to retrieve large themes and topics, a zoom lens to enlarge images, and simple commands to store and print documents.</p>
        <p>With a click of the mouse, we are transported to the seaports of Bremen or Liverpool, where giant shipping lines like Cunard, White Star and Hamburg-Amerika herd waiting immigrants into dockside hotels to be examined, fumigated and then quarantined for the trip to New York.</p>
        <p>For a $12 ticket -- often prepaid by relatives in the United States -- the immigrant received third-class passage or steerage on a deck crammed with hundreds of other bodies, enduring a week or more of rolling seas without a bath or a change of clothes. The great majority of people who went down with the Titanic were immigrants trapped in the bowels of the doomed ship.</p>
        <p>Entering New York harbor, the immigrants were taken to Ellis Island on a giant barge. We watch as medical officers single out those with a heavy cough or a wild look in their eye, and then mark their lapels with blue chalk, indicating a need for further review. We enter an interrogation room to see an Italian fisherman being asked about his employment prospects, and look in on an exclusion hearing where a Russian Jew is being questioned about his political beliefs. By selecting from a short menu of questions, we can direct the actors in these video dramas to give us the information we require to judge the cases for ourselves.</p>
        <p>Ellis Island could be a frightening experience for immigrants, but it also served them well. There were showers and hot food for everyone, and the hospitals provided excellent medical care. Most immigrants were processed quickly, in a matter of hours. Fewer than 10 percent faced additional tests or hearings; and only 2 percent were denied entry to the United States. Government policy at Ellis Island was to admit, if at all possible.</p>
        <p>The center went quickly downhill in the 1920's. The Bolshevik Revolution, the Red Scare of 1919, disillusionment with America's participation in World War I -- all raised anti-immigrant feelings at home. Congress passed the National Origins Act in 1924, which used a quota system to slash immigration from central and southern Europe. The Great Depression of the 1930's further slowed this process, and, when Ellis Island closed for good in 1954, the United States contained the smallest percentage of foreign-born residents in its history.</p>
        <p>But times have again changed. New immigrants are pouring into the nation, rekindling old fears. Viewing ''The Ellis Island Experience,'' one is struck by the battles we keep refighting, the lessons we repeatedly forget. In the balance swings the golden door to freedom, its direction uncertain, its future unknown.</p>
