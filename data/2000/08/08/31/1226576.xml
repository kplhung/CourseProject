        <p>CROATIA: TRIBUNAL WITNESS SLAIN -- A Croatian witness in war crimes trials who testified nearly two years ago was slain in a bomb blast near his home in Zagreb in what was seen as a warning to others who might testify to the International Criminal Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia about possible Croatian war crimes in Bosnia. Tribunal officials said Milan Levar was given government protection in April 1998, and that they had had no contact with him since.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: TRIMBLE SPEAKS OUT -- The British province's most powerful Protestant politician, the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, condemned warring Protestant paramilitary groups whose turf war led to the firebombing of more than 25 homes in two towns and has resulted in the deaths of three men and the shooting of an 11-year-old girl in the past 10 days. The police say the violence is a struggle for control of the drug trade.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: STRIKE HITS TOURISTS -- Thousands of vacationing British tourists were stranded at ferry terminals on both sides of the English Channel as French fishermen blockaded piers to protest rising fuel prices. Also on the rise were neighborly irritations. One Englishman stuck in Calais, David Langford, 28, of King's Lynn, Norfolk, said, ''I've just traveled from Thailand and I have come through 11 countries, and it is always France that causes the trouble.''</p>

        <p>MOZAMBIQUE: ELECTION REPORT -- In its final report on Mozambique's elections, the Carter Center found that the credibility of the vote was marred by technical problems and a lack of transparency in the final count. But the center officials, who observed the elections on Dec. 3, 4 and 5, said the problems did not affect the result. President Joaquim Chissano was re-elected and his party retained control.</p>
