        <p>A 52-year-old Staten Island man has been found to have the West Nile virus, the sixth human case of the  disease this year, city officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Also yesterday, state officials announced the first confirmed case of West Nile virus in a horse, on Staten Island, and reported that the virus had been confirmed for the first time in bats after the testing of three dead bats upstate.</p>
        <p>The sixth human victim of the disease, a man who was not identified, was at home recovering, the city health commissioner, Neal L. Cohen, told The Associated Press. The man, who lives in the Graniteville section of Staten Island, became ill on Aug. 15 and was hospitalized for a week.</p>
        <p>Four of the other people infected have recovered, while an 87-year-old Brooklyn woman remains hospitalized in critical condition.</p>
        <p>The horse was put to death Aug. 20 after it contracted the virus, the state agriculture commissioner, Nathan Rudgers, said yesterday. It was the first confirmed case of equine encephalitis related to West Nile virus this year, officials said. Last summer, 25 horses (9 of which died or were killed) on Long Island were found to have West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>The city also announced that two more birds in Queens, in Woodhaven and Breezy Point, had tested positive. Pesticide spraying was scheduled again in parts of Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Although West Nile was known to infect small mammals like cats, the virus had never before been isolated in bats, state officials said.</p>
        <p>The bats were captured in homes in downtown Albany.</p>
        <p>''This is another clear indication that there are still many more questions than answers about how West Nile virus is establishing itself in the Western Hemisphere,'' said the state health commissioner, Dr. Antonia C. Novello.</p>
        <p>Health officials said bats infected with West Nile virus could not transmit illness to humans. Like birds and  mammals, however, they can be infected through mosquito bites. As of yesterday, West Nile virus had been confirmed in 49 of the state's 62 counties, the health department said.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, Madison and Newington joined the list of towns where dead birds with the virus had been found, The Associated Press reported. This summer, West Nile has turned up in 162 birds in 31 communities across the state.</p>
