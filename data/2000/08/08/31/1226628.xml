        <p>Senator Joseph Lieberman's nomination as the Democratic vice-presidential candidate this month was widely hailed as a breakthrough for tolerance. Now, in a remarkable campaign development, Mr. Lieberman is being criticized by some Jewish leaders and others fearful that his declarations of faith as a devout Jew, and his calls for more religion in public life, are an affront to Americans who are less religious or whose faith comes from a different tradition. Ironically, leaders of the Christian right are defending Mr. Lieberman while asserting that some of their own leaders who seek a bigger role for religion and religious institutions should be absolved of similar charges of intolerance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has long and eloquently argued that a general decline in moral values, especially in popular culture, must be reversed by a reaffirmation of religion. However, in comments last Sunday he seemed to cross the boundaries of tolerance when he declared that ''George Washington warned us never to indulge the supposition 'that morality can be maintained without religion.' '' As the Anti-Defamation League pointed out, this sort of talk is offensive to many highly ethical citizens who are not religious. On Tuesday Mr. Lieberman explained that he did not mean to suggest that irreligious people could not be moral. But whenever religious matters are addressed, Mr. Lieberman should firmly and unequivocally reiterate his support for the separation of church and state, a bedrock principle of the American Constitution and political system.</p>
        <p>No one should want Mr. Lieberman to refrain from speaking from his heart about his faith. Voters are entitled to know -- indeed they need to know -- what inspires and informs the thinking of anyone running for office. Mr. Lieberman has also performed a great service by reiterating that deep religious faith is not a monopoly of conservatives. As he notes, religious ''awakenings'' led to such liberal milestones as the Bill of Rights in the 18th century, the abolition of slavery and various progressive social reforms in the 19th century, and the civil rights revolution of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Lieberman is calling for a fourth ''awakening'' of religion as an antidote to violence, promiscuity and the degradation of family values. These positions, not to mention his condemnation of President Clinton's sexual misconduct in 1998, appeal to many voters and were clearly a major reason Vice President Al Gore selected him as his running mate. The idea that spiritual guidance can help in combating immorality is irrefutable. The danger lies in political appeals that are so zealous that they unsettle Americans with different religious views, making them feel like second-class citizens, or lead to policies coercive toward non-believers.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Lieberman has pointed out, throughout American history tolerance for American pluralism and diversity has done far more to enhance religion than to undermine it. That is why it is good for the national dialogue to see someone of deep religious faith argue in favor of abortion rights and against school prayer and discrimination against homosexuals, as Mr. Lieberman has. Mr. Lieberman has also condemned the movie industry for its disdain of moral values, deplored the proliferation of pornographic and violent material on the Internet and -- like Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush -- called for greater government funding for ''faith-based'' organizations that deliver services to the poor and the homeless.</p>
        <p>In instituting these policies, there should never be any compromise with the Constitution's ban on government establishment of religion. Exhorting Hollywood to make different movies cannot veer into government censorship, and government funding of ''faith-based'' organizations should never be used to support religious proselytizing by these groups.</p>
        <p>What should also never happen is for either side to frame the debate over these questions as a kind of litmus test of one's religious conviction, which is something many advocates of school prayer and other issues have done. It is fine to call for more religion in American public life. But supporting the constitutionally based separation of religion from public policy or favoring limits on the role of government in promoting religious values should not be denigrated as immoral or anti-religion. In the end, tolerance and understanding of the boundaries between church and state are what have allowed religion to flourish in the United States as it has in few other countries in history.</p>
