        <p>Department of Defense officials and New Jersey environmental regulators signed an accord yesterday in which the Pentagon agreed to finance the cleanup of 550 contaminated sites on current and former military bases around the state.</p>
        <p>The signing came two years after the two parties agreed in principle to such a plan and after surveys to identify the sites on 29 former and current Army, Navy and Air Force bases, said Robert C. Shinn Jr., commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
        <p>The agreement gives state officials a role in setting priorities for which sites are cleaned up as Defense Department funds become available. Mr. Shinn said the total cost of the cleanup, for which there is no firm timetable, is $350 million.</p>
        <p>New Jersey became only the second state in the nation to enter into such an arrangement with the military, which began shrinking its forces and facilities after the cold war ended. The first agreement was signed in 1998 by Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>''The whole thrust of this agreement is to have a joint priority list and really focus on cleanup,'' Mr. Shinn said after the Pentagon ceremony at which he signed the agreement. ''They are saying that they are responsible for the costs of the cleanups, and they want to get budget allocations for projects that they can actually complete without problems at the state level.''</p>
        <p>Sherri W. Goodman, deputy under secretary of defense for environmental security, said that New Jersey and any other states that sign agreements will ''benefit from having a known plan for addressing future assessments and cleanups.''</p>
        <p>The key cleanup sites, Mr. Shinn said, include a missile silo at McGuire Air Force Base where a 1960 fire caused plutonium contamination. Since then, the site has been sealed in reinforced concrete. Another site is a Fort Dix bombing range, on the fringes of the Pinelands in the center of the state, where there is a risk of dummy bombs leaching lead into ground water.</p>
        <p>The environmental effort will also allow the state and federal governments to experiment with new cleanup technologies, as they already have at one Fort Dix site near Pemberton Township. There, Mr. Shinn said, the Army is financing a soil washing program to remove lead from a target range and planting  mustard plants to absorb any lead residue that remains.</p>
        <p>But Commissioner Shinn said the most important feature of the agreement -- aside from experimental technologies and federal financing -- was that it would speed up the effort to clean up sites before extensive environmental damage and threats to health and safety occur.</p>
