        <p>A RIOT of color and a burst of energy hit the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center last week when the Accent on Design Show came to town. Child-friendly plastic stools, bright children's chairs and affordable hand-blown glass vases in a rainbow of colors are just a few of the new designs that were shown. Some of the high-voltage energy came from the designers themselves, many of them young and marketing their work directly to consumers on the Internet. And since home furnishing trends are said to follow fashion, both are looking youthful this season. ''Co-purchasing -- children shopping with parents -- is a millennial trend,'' said William Strauss, a generational historian and co-author of ''Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation'' (Vintage Books, September 2000). ''This is an optimistic generation,'' he said, with considerable buying power. Children are being consulted on purchases from computers to home furnishings, he continued, adding, ''Parents want their homes to be kid-friendly.''</p>

        <p>A RIOT of color and a burst of energy hit the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center last week when the Accent on Design Show came to town. Child-friendly plastic stools, bright children's chairs and affordable hand-blown glass vases in a rainbow of colors are just a few of the new designs that were shown. Some of the high-voltage energy came from the designers themselves, many of them young and marketing their work directly to consumers on the Internet. And since home furnishing trends are said to follow fashion, both are looking youthful this season. ''Co-purchasing -- children shopping with parents -- is a millennial trend,'' said William Strauss, a generational historian and co-author of ''Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation'' (Vintage Books, September 2000). ''This is an optimistic generation,'' he said, with considerable buying power. Children are being consulted on purchases from computers to home furnishings, he continued, adding, ''Parents want their homes to be kid-friendly.''</p>
        <p>1. Pablo Pardo, an industrial designer based in San Francisco, and his IO desk lamp, which won the Accent on Design award for best product. The completely adjustable lamp's neck extends from 20 inches to 26 inches, and the high-low light can rotate in all directions. The lamp's base is zinc; the rubber-covered neck comes in a choice of gray, dark blue, ivory or green; $250 from the designer's Web site, www.pablodesigns.com or (415) 822-2712.</p>
        <p>2. The flexible, colorful Plastic Fantastic Vase, designed by a New York architect, Harry Gutfreund, changes size and shape. ''I think it will appeal to kids as well as adults,'' Mr. Gutfreund said. ''It moves like some toys do.'' And at this price the vase is attractive gift-wrapping for a bouquet of flowers as well as a house gift; $10.95 each at Placewares in Boston, (781) 769-8500, or the MOMA Design Store, 44 West 53rd Street; (800) 793-3167.</p>
        <p>3. The Topo Modular shelving unit by Pur Design fits together without screws or nails. Each 46-inch-high, 50-inch-wide unit can be connected vertically or horizontally to another unit. In either dark or light wood finish; $430 each at Jensen Lewis, 89 Seventh Avenue (16th Street).</p>
        <p>4. A 17-inch serving dish is made of bamboo with a matte-lacquer finish in robin's-egg blue with white ($150). Individual-size bowls in other color combinations, but with the same finish, are $58. Both at Ad Hoc Softwares, 136 Wooster Street (Prince Street).</p>
        <p>5. A set of six bubble-glass tumblers, in mixed colors, is $24.95 at the Yellow Door, 1308 Avenue M, in the Midwood section of Brooklyn; (718) 998-7382.</p>
        <p>6. Who says that shelving has to be rectangular? The Atom circular shelving system by Mick Bradbury, right, an English designer, can be set up against a wall or used as a free-standing room divider. The components can be configured horizontally or vertically. The system shown is made of chrome-plated metal wire but is also available in a galvanized finish for outdoor use. The circles lock together with connectors -- no screws needed. Two sets of three circles (shown) cost $990. Shipped worldwide from the designer's company, Stone Circle in Derbyshire, England; (011) 44-1-77-385-0081 or www.stonecircle.co.uk.</p>
        <p>7. The Blisterlamp by a Dutch designer, Henk Stallinga, uses package design as a finished object; $80 at Moss, 150 Greene Street (Houston Street).</p>
        <p>8. The Baby Circular chair was designed by George Baumiller, 82, a Polish Modernist architect who has been living in the United States since the early 1970's. Reminiscent of a 1950's design, it comes in pink, orange or green washable cotton canvas on a black metal frame; $99 from www.lampa.com, or (631) 722-9450.</p>
        <p>9. Yuyu is a stackable plastic indoor-outdoor stool in ivory, orange, blue, lime green or gray. Designed in Italy by Stefano Giovannoni for Magis, it is $60 at Totem Design, 71 Franklin Street (Broadway).</p>
        <p>10. The hand-blown Dimple vase by John Pomp, a New York glass artist, comes in yellow, olive, orange or pink; $80 at Auto, 805 Washington Street (Horatio Street).</p>
        <p>11. An alternative to the generic folding chair, Captain Hook is a lightweight aluminum chair with a silver-metallic mesh seat and back; folded, it can hang on a hook; $125 at Mxyplyzyk, 125 Greenwich Avenue (13th Street).</p>
