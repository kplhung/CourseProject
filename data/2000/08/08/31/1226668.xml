      <abstract>
        <p>Corrections of Aug 29 article: Lori Berenson did not raise fist to cameras when she appeared before journalists at Peruvian detention center in 1996; her lawyer now says she did not have romantic relationship with rebel; said rebel who testified against her may have done so to get lighter sentence, not life sentence</p>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A front-page article on Tuesday about a decision by a Peruvian military court to revoke a life sentence and grant a new treason trial to Lori Berenson, a New Yorker,included an erroneous detail in an account of an appearance by Ms. Berenson before journalists at a detention center in 1996. She did not raise a fist to the cameras.</p>
        <p>The article also included an outdated statement by one of her lawyers, Thomas Nooter. While he said four years ago that Ms. Berenson had had a romantic relationship with a member of the Tupac Amaru rebel group, Mr. Nooter now says that he knows from speaking to her since then that she did not.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated what Mr. Nooter had said about a rebel who testified against Ms. Berenson. He said that the rebel might have incriminated her in exchange for a lighter sentence, not in exchange for a life sentence.</p>
