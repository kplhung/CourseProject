        <p>Reflecting a shift from costly television ads to less expensive online advertising and marketing, per-customer acquisition costs for online retailers declined to $40 in the second quarter of this year, from a high of $71 in the fourth quarter of 1999, a new survey says. The survey of 66 North American online retailers, conducted by the Boston Consulting Group and Shop.org, a trade association for Internet retailers, also found, however, that acquisition costs were higher in the second quarter than the $35 a customer found in the third quarter of 1999, when the survey was first conducted. Conversion rates -- the proportion of online customer visits that turn into actual orders -- as well as the rate of repeat customers, improved slightly, according to the study. ''These key economic factors are all marginally up, but in aggregate they'll have a significant impact for online retailers as they try to achieve profitability,'' said James Vogtle, the director of e-commerce research at Boston Consulting.</p>
