        <p>The family of a Hasidic man who was fatally shot by the police last year while wielding a hammer on a street in central Brooklyn has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit charging that the officers involved in the killing acted with excessive force.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, which was filed late Tuesday night in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, also leveled much broader accusations against the Police Department and the administration of Mayor Rudolph W.

        <p>The family of a Hasidic man who was fatally shot by the police last year while wielding a hammer on a street in central Brooklyn has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit charging that the officers involved in the killing acted with excessive force.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, which was filed late Tuesday night in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, also leveled much broader accusations against the Police Department and the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, claiming they erected a barricade of false statements to cover up the incident and allowed -- even encouraged -- the officers involved to speak among themselves to get their stories straight before talking with investigators.</p>
        <p>From virtually the moment that the man, Gidone Busch, who was mentally disturbed, was killed in a volley of 12 shots fired by police officers on Aug. 30, 1999, there have been competing reports of what happened that night on the streets of Borough Park.</p>
        <p>The day after the shooting, Howard Safir, then the police commissioner, said that Mr. Busch, 31, was shot as he was beating a sergeant with a hammer.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors, citing both police and civilian witnesses, have said that Mr. Busch was shot after he broke free of the police effort to contain him. He ran up a narrow stairway from his basement apartment, struck an officer with his hammer, then rushed past the police.</p>
        <p>They said he stood on the sidewalk with the hammer raised over his head as officers stood around him with guns drawn and ordered him to drop the hammer. There was a distinct single shot, closely followed by a volley, and Mr. Busch fell dead, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>Two months later, a state grand jury in Brooklyn cleared the officers involved in the scuffle after finding that they had acted within the law.</p>
        <p>But the Busch family's lawsuit, which was filed a day before the first anniversary of Mr. Busch's death, contends that the police acted ''recklessly, intentionally, maliciously and without justification'' when they opened fire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Busch, the lawsuit maintains, never threatened or tried to hurt a police officer or anyone else.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the lawsuit charged that the officers were ''permitted, if not encouraged, to converse and consult among themselves'' to cover up the truth.</p>
        <p>It also accused the city and the Police Department of failing to eradicate a ''code of silence'' among the police that was so deeply ingrained it constituted ''the actual custom, practice and policy of the City of New York.''</p>
        <p>Michael Anton, a spokesman for the mayor, declined to comment on the lawsuit last night.</p>
        <p>Sgt. Gerry Falcon, a police spokeswoman, also refused to comment on the lawsuit yesterday, saying the department never discusses pending litigation.</p>
