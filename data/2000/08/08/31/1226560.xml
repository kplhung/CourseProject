        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report (news article, Aug. 29) the Anti-Defamation League's request that Senator Joseph I. Lieberman stop expressing his religious beliefs as part of his vice-presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>What does the Anti-Defamation League fear? Is the electorate not entitled to know the men who seek the only truly national offices, their essential natures as well as their policy positions?</p>

        <p>You report (news article, Aug. 29) the Anti-Defamation League's request that Senator Joseph I. Lieberman stop expressing his religious beliefs as part of his vice-presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>What does the Anti-Defamation League fear? Is the electorate not entitled to know the men who seek the only truly national offices, their essential natures as well as their policy positions?</p>
        <p>Far from flaunting or ''hawking'' his faith, Senator Lieberman has allowed it to form him as a man and to inform his view of society and the world. It is an integral and salient aspect of his being. We the people need to judge him on that basis.</p>
        <p>(Rabbi) NESANEL KASNETT  Brooklyn, Aug. 29, 2000</p>
