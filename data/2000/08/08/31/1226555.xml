        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Aug. 28 front-page article ''Short of People, Iowa Seeks to Be Ellis Island of Midwest'' does not address whether it is desirable for immigrants to move to Iowa.</p>
        <p>I was born in Iowa, after my parents emigrated from India. Although my parents both worked as professionals in the community and I was successful academically and athletically, I have story upon story of heart-wrenching experiences of discrimination I faced there. Those experiences contributed to my decision to leave Iowa after high school.</p>
