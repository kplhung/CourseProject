        <p>A woman's death at her job in the city's workfare program earlier this month prompted bitter criticism of the mayor yesterday by opponents of the program, who said the woman had been afraid to take time off to visit her doctor.</p>
        <p>The woman, Laura Morales, 34, a mother of three, died Aug. 11 while working as a kitchen aide at a Brooklyn homeless shelter.</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning, a group of about 100 people protested the rigors of workfare outside the offices of Jason Turner, the commissioner of the Human Resources Administration, who is in charge of the workfare program.</p>
        <p>''It is not the type of work that caused this death, but the atmosphere in which she worked,'' said Stephen DiBrienza, the chairman of the City Council General Welfare Committee and an impassioned critic of workfare, who attended the protest.</p>
        <p>In an interview, he said Ms. Morales ''lived in fear and died in fear, and it is Jason Turner who is responsible.''</p>
        <p>According to an account yesterday in the Queens edition of Newsday, friends and relatives of Ms. Morales's said she had been experiencing severe headaches, but had refused to take time off for fear of losing her welfare benefits.</p>
        <p>The cause of the woman's death has not been disclosed by the city's medical examiner. But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, responding to the protest at a news conference, said that evidence indicated she had died of a stroke.</p>
        <p>In defending the workfare program, the mayor also said that Ms. Morales would not have been prevented from seeing a doctor because of her assignment.</p>
        <p>''Tragically, unfortunately, people do die at work,'' the mayor said. He appeared at City Hall with Mr. Turner and several workfare administrators and praised their ''aggressive efforts to move thousands of people from welfare to work.''</p>
