        <p>Spider-Man isn't scaling the Great Wall just yet. But Stan Lee, the legendary impresario of Marvel Comic superheroes, was in Beijing this week as an honored guest at a ''friendship banquet'' of leading Japanese and Chinese cartoonists and animators.</p>
        <p>And he just happened to bring along the president and chief executive officer of Stan Lee Media, a year-old Internet venture that dreams of marketing Mr. Lee's latest characters and products to 1.3 billion Chinese.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee said in an interview that he had been invited to Beijing by the Japan-Asia Comics Exchange Society of Tokyo and by The People's Daily, which together sponsored the banquet and an associated museum exhibition of Japanese animation drawings and Chinese cartoons. Just why the gray official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party was playing host was not clear.</p>
        <p>''It was one of the most thrilling experiences of my life to speak before that group!'' Mr. Lee said after the banquet on Wednesday night. ''It's the first time Japanese and Chinese artists have been gathered together in this way, and if anything can bring countries together, it's cartoons!'' (A listener could visualize giant exclamation points falling into place.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee, 77, and the famous characters he helped create in the heyday of Marvel Comics, including Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk and the X-Men, are scarcely known in China. But this month Stan Lee Media, which is based in Encino, Calif., and calls itself a ''multimedia production, marketing and licensing company,'' formed a partnership with a leading Japanese producer of animation, the Venture Soft Company. Their venture, perhaps helping explain the invitation, aims to market Mr. Lee's Web-based animated series and associated products in Asia.</p>
        <p>Marvel-era die-hards may have a hard time digesting some of Stan Lee's latest creations. True, there is a Web serial called ''The Seventh Portal,'' featuring superheroes and villains out to conquer the universe. But his latest projects include an animated Web series featuring the Backstreet Boys as rock stars by day and supercrusaders by night with a promotional tie-in at Burger King, and another series presenting the R&amp;B singer Mary J. Blige as a warrior linked to a new line of hip-hop clothing.</p>
        <p>''We're using the Internet to launch new branded character franchises,'' is how Stan Lee Media's chief executive, Ken Williams, described the company in an interview here. Mr. Williams is a former head of Sony's digital studios division.</p>
        <p>''The Seventh Portal,'' Mr. Williams said, is likely to reappear as a live feature film, a ride at Paramount theme parks and a conventional Saturday morning animated series, and toys are being licensed.</p>
        <p>And, oh yes. ''Well, I think inevitably there will be comic books,'' he said after being prodded. ''But comics are a relatively minor part of the revenue stream.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams said that he and Mr. Lee were aware of the barriers to artistic production or sales in China. But the praise Mr. Lee heard at Wednesday's banquet, he said, ''was a validation of Stan's work and a validation of the idea of entering China with American-style animation.''</p>
        <p>''We'll be back, and we'll be exploring ways we can work in China,'' Mr. Williams said. ''We'll be moving resolutely but judiciously.''</p>
        <p>As Disney and other Western entertainment groups have discovered, gaining access to produce films or Web content in China or even to market imported products faces stiff obstacles. For example, this year's X-Men movie, loosely based on the old comic book, has not been approved for commercial screening in China, which strictly limits film imports, although pirated video compact discs sell well in the streets. This may soften somewhat after China joins the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>Chinese children often read translations of Japanese or Taiwanese cartoon books and favor some Japanese animated serials that are allowed on Chinese television. The domestic products tend to be bland.</p>
        <p>China's political leaders have often expressed concern about an influx of foreign animated cartoons, said William Brent, president of China Entertainment Network, a consulting concern in Shanghai. ''They've repeatedly called for animation by the Chinese for the Chinese,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Animated shows and other children's fare are closely scrutinized by government censors who worry about excess violence as well as what they deem inappropriate cultural or political content.</p>
        <p>''If the Stan Lee group thinks they can come into China and make superheroes along Western lines, they'll be disappointed,'' Mr. Brent said. ''If they can find a way to develop home-grown superheroes here, they'll have a better chance.''</p>
