        <p>The Israeli Supreme Court ruled today that an Israeli scholar had a copyright on his reconstruction of an important Dead Sea Scroll and that his right had been violated by an unauthorized early publication of his work.</p>
        <p>Lawyers who argued the case said that it was the first in which copyright law had been applied in court to a reconstruction of an ancient document.</p>
        <p>Upholding the ruling of a lower court seven years ago, the decision evoked what had been a heated debate over access to the 2,000-year-old scrolls, once restricted to a small group of scholars but now open to researchers.</p>
        <p>Discovered in the late 1940's and 1950's in caves near the Dead Sea, the more than 800 scrolls, including the oldest known copies of Old Testament books, are thought to have been written between the second century B.C. and A.D. 70. Scholars believe they provide valuable insights into the history of Judaism and the origins of Christianity.</p>
        <p>Their study was dominated for years by a team of editors overseen by the Israel Antiquities Authority, but mounting criticism of restricted access to the manuscripts led to a wide expansion of the circle of editors and the eventual release of photographs of the scrolls to all scholars.</p>
        <p>Today's ruling rejected an appeal by Hershel Shanks, president of the Biblical Archaeology Society in the United States and editor of Biblical Archaeology Review, a strong advocate of free access to the scrolls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shanks appealed a Jerusalem District Court ruling that he had infringed the copyright of the Israeli scholar, Elisha Qimron, by publishing Dr. Qimron's reconstruction of a scroll without credit or permission before the planned publication of the work.</p>
        <p>The reconstruction appeared in an appendix to Mr. Shanks's forward to ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' a collection of more than 1,700 photographs of scroll fragments published in 1991 by his society in an effort to bring previously unpublished documents to light.</p>
        <p>The editors, who were also sued by Dr. Qimron and joined the appeal, were Robert H. Eisenman of California State University at Long Beach and James M. Robinson of the Claremont Graduate School in California.</p>
        <p>Dr. Qimron spent more than a decade deciphering and reconstructing the text of the scroll, known as M.M.T., initials of the Hebrew words for ''Some Precepts of the Torah.''</p>
        <p>Arranging scroll fragments and filling in some 40 percent of the restored text based on an analysis of the context, Dr. Qimron reconstructed 121 lines of the manuscript, which lists differences over religious laws that divided the sect that wrote the scrolls from mainstream Judaism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shanks and his lawyers argued in court that Dr. Qimron was uncovering an existing composition and could not claim a copyright for reconstructing an ancient text he did not write. They asserted that granting Dr. Qimron a copyright could inhibit further study of the reconstructed manuscript and harm academic freedom. But Judge Jacob Turkel wrote in the decision today that by filling in gaps of missing text, deciphering and putting together scroll fragments, Dr. Qimron had shown ''originality and creativity'' that earned him a copyright that had been infringed by Mr. Shanks.</p>
        <p>Dr. Qimron said the case had nothing to do with academic freedom and everything to do with theft of his work.</p>
        <p>''This ruling showed that intellectual property also comes under the commandment, 'Thou shalt not steal,' '' he said.</p>
