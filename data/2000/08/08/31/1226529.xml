        <p>Both United States teams gained at the World Championships here today. The American open team won 18-12 against the Australians, the front-runners in their qualifying group, thanks largely to an optimistic grand slam venture that succeeded. The Americans followed by taking the maximum victory points against Portugal, winning 25-5, and are now second, 14 victory points behind Australia.</p>
        <p>Four teams from each of the four groups will qualify for the playoffs next week. The leaders in the other groups are Poland, Sweden and Italy.</p>

        <p>Both United States teams gained at the World Championships here today. The American open team won 18-12 against the Australians, the front-runners in their qualifying group, thanks largely to an optimistic grand slam venture that succeeded. The Americans followed by taking the maximum victory points against Portugal, winning 25-5, and are now second, 14 victory points behind Australia.</p>
        <p>Four teams from each of the four groups will qualify for the playoffs next week. The leaders in the other groups are Poland, Sweden and Italy.</p>
        <p>The American women's team, with six players from Texas, started the week slowly but has pulled up to fifth position in its group, trailing Norway, Austria, Denmark and Finland. Today it won 18-12 against Sweden and 19-11 against Denmark. Leading in the other group is Germany, with Canada close behind. Eight teams from each group will qualify for the playoffs.</p>
        <p>On the diagramed deal from the third round, a large audience watching in the Vugraph theater cheered a brilliant lead by an Icelandic player.</p>
        <p>Matthias Thorvaldsson held the West cards and listened carefully to the bidding of his Chinese opponents. This followed a natural course until North jumped to five no-trump: a grand slam force, asking South to bid seven diamonds if he held two of the top three diamond honors. This was an inconceivable action unless North held first round control in clubs. West correctly inferred a void on his left. Against six diamonds he made the dramatic lead of the club seven, knowing that South would be forced to ruff in the dummy for fear of losing the first trick.</p>
        <p>South duly ruffed in the dummy and faced a difficult task. He could have survived by leading a low trump, although the play would still have been complex. He chose to cash the heart ace, ruff a heart and lead the diamond queen. This was disastrous. He ducked in dummy, and East took his king and played a club. Dummy was forced to ruff, and East eventually scored a second trump trick for down one.</p>
        <p>In the replay the Icelandic North-South were content to play four hearts, and their team gained 11 imps, eventually winning a close match.</p>
        <p>With any other lead the slam would probably have succeeded, and China would have won the match. The same brilliant lead, with the same result, was made by Takos Kannavos of Greece, playing against Monaco.</p>
