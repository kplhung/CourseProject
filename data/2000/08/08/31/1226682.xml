        <p>A Long Island man admitted in court today that he killed his parents -- a husband-and-wife legal team -- last fall, then set fire to their upstate vacation home to cover his tracks.</p>
        <p>After the man, Adam Roberts, 23, pleaded guilty here in Ulster County Court to first-degree murder and arson, relatives told reporters that he had been a heroin addict and that he killed his parents -- Seth Roberts, 51, and Ronna Roberts, 50, of Great Neck -- after they took him to the house to ''go cold turkey'' and refused to let him leave to get drugs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roberts faces 25 years to life in prison when he is sentenced on Oct. 6, though family members have pressed for a lighter sentence.</p>
        <p>Today's proceeding unfolded more like a family support session for a drug-addicted relative than as the first step toward what could become a life behind bars for Mr. Roberts.</p>
        <p>As he walked into the courtroom in bright orange prison garb, Mr. Roberts beamed at his mother's mother and two brothers, who were sitting in the front row. Then, in front of Judge J. Michael Bruhn, he admitted killing his parents at their mountain retreat in nearby Woodstock on Nov. 14. Three days later, he said, he went back and burned down the house with the bodies inside.</p>
        <p>''To say I have remorse is an understatement,'' Mr. Roberts told the judge. Swallowing hard, he added, ''I've lost two very close people in my life and I'm going to have to live with that, and that's going to be worse than any prison sentence, and for that I am truly sorry.''</p>
        <p>Despite the murders, Mr. Roberts's maternal grandmother, Sylvia Fidler, has petitioned tirelessly to gain leniency for him. As he admitted to the murders, she sat red-eyed behind him, and afterward gave him a long, hard hug.</p>
        <p>''I love him very, very much,'' she said later. ''This was an aberration. This was not Adam.''</p>
        <p>After the proceeding, Mrs. Fidler and her sons, Elliot and Lewis Fidler, held a news conference to say that as a heroin addict in need of treatment, Mr. Roberts was not entirely responsible for the deaths.</p>
        <p>He had been addicted to drugs for more than a year before the murders, the family said. During much of that time he had been living at his parents' home in Great Neck, after dropping out of Syracuse University.</p>
        <p>The parents, who practiced immigration law in Manhattan, sent Adam Roberts to a private physician rather than to a drug treatment program, the family said. His lawyer, Howard H. Weiswasser, said the doctor prescribed medication without knowing how much heroin Mr. Roberts was using.</p>
        <p>Two weeks after their son visited the doctor, Seth and Ronna Roberts drove him to their vacation retreat to help him ''go cold turkey,'' the family said in its statement. Mr. Roberts, desperate to get more drugs, wanted to leave, and when his parents tried to prevent him, he killed them, Mr. Weiswasser said.</p>
        <p>After the killings, Mr. Roberts fled in his parents' car, but returned on Nov. 17, poured gasoline over their bodies and burned the $400,000 home.</p>
        <p>He was arrested on Nov. 26, as he was leaving North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, where, his lawyer said, he had checked himself in on Nov. 19 suffering from a viral infection in his arm. Mr. Weiswasser said today that Mr. Roberts had become infected by injecting drugs. Since his arrest, he has been in the Ulster County Jail, under a suicide watch.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 4, 2000, Monday  An article on Thursday about Adam Roberts, a Long Island man who pleaded guilty to having killed his parents and then having set fire to their vacation home, included an erroneous date from the district attorney for the murders. They occurred on Nov. 13, 1999, not Nov. 14.</p>
