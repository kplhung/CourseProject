        <p>This is a new 30-  second commercial, called ''Believe,'' that the Lazio campaign began broadcasting yesterday.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- The Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- A single shot: John S. McCain, the Arizona senator and champion of legislation to overhaul campaign finance laws, sitting in a chair, calmly talking straight into the camera, and showing a bit of disappointment.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''You know, when Mrs. Clinton said she wouldn't take huge special interest soft money contributions if her opponent wouldn't, I believed her. But since then, she's taken in millions in soft money and used it for attack ads distorting Rick Lazio's record. Rick Lazio has said he'll agree to a soft money ban, but Mrs. Clinton just refuses.  So it's pretty clear there's only  one Senate candidate who really wants campaign finance reform.  Rick Lazio -- he's the candidate you can trust.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- It is less than accurate to say, as Mr. McCain does in the ad, that Mrs. Clinton refuses to agree to a ban on soft-money contributions, the largely unregulated contributions that are supposed to be used mainly for party building. Mrs. Clinton called for such a ban before Mr. Lazio even entered the race. However, she attached conditions on her proposal that Mr. Lazio's aides have dismissed as untenable: that he make certain that a dozen or so independent committees that are financing television campaigns attacking Mrs. Clinton halt their efforts as well. The result is a deadlock unlikely to break.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Although the ostensible subject of the advertisement is campaign finance reform, it really is about Mrs. Clinton's credibility, and thus, the crucial sentence in this ad is the last one. It is a theme that Mr. Lazio used in another ad earlier this week, and one that will recur. Mr. McCain was a popular figure, nationally, during his run for the presidency this year, although he did lose the primary in New York to George W. Bush.  In theory, at least, he appeals to independent voters who may not have made up their minds in this race.</p>
