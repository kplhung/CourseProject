        <p>EVEN the name is perfect  right out of the 50's and 60's, when teenagers were watching ''The Wild One'' and ''How to Stuff a Wild Bikini'' at the drive-in, humming doo-wop ballads and spending their summer vacations at this Jersey Shore town, where practically every motel has a plastic palm tree overhanging its car court and every third motel owner is a character deserving of his own sitcom.</p>
        <p>In Wildwood's heyday, its boardwalk amusement park buzzed. Its neon streets thronged with tourists. Its 301 motels, with names like the Caribbean, the Pink Champagne, Ebb Tide and Costa del Sole, never brought in their No Vacancy signs during the summer season. Wildwood was hot then, and neighboring Cape May, with its dowdy Victorian summer houses, was dead.</p>
        <p>But the good times rolled by, and the turquoise and pink metal motel doors, opening to concrete rooms overlooking parking lots, lost their appeal. Families stayed away, drug dealers roamed the boardwalk, absentee landlords neglected their properties and the architecture began to look dated. As older motel owners died or moved to Florida, the paint began to flake and the neon to flicker.</p>
        <p>''I had an aunt who loved to go down to the beach and watch the motels put on their neon lights,'' said Anne Hufnal, 67, who with her husband, Albert, 69, owns a red brick bungalow on a side street here. ''Then they kind of faded -- the lights went out.''</p>
        <p>But the neon is coming back, and with it ambitious plans for Wildwood and its sister towns, Wildwood Crest, West Wildwood and North Wildwood, all suspended in time on a barrier island about three hours by car from Times Square. In the Wildwoods, what was once dismissed as working class is now lauded as ''midcentury modern.''</p>
        <p>In 1999, nearly three decades after Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown  and Steven Izenour wrote their homage to the 1950's, ''Learning From Las Vegas,'' Mr. Izenour joined a group of architects and design students as they unveiled a jazzy blueprint for a town revival here, complete with offbeat motel makeovers and campy new buildings. They called it ''Learning From the Wildwoods.'' Now that it has had time to sink in, the unofficial doo-wop preservation master plan is prompting a new respect among townspeople for ''trophy'' motels like the Kelly green and daffodil-yellow Caribbean and bringing momentum to redesign dozens of other vintage motels and small businesses.</p>
        <p>Doo-wop preservation, as defined here, aims to keep the pizazz of the 50's and 60's without freeze-drying it.</p>
        <p>Thomas Hine, an architecture critic formerly with The Philadelphia Inquirer and the author of ''Populuxe,'' a look at popular culture from 1954 to 1964, said that the Wildwoods epitomized the cheap construction and throwaway ethic of that time. ''You knew something better was going to come along,'' he explained. ''The belief in progress was so strong you didn't have to save anything.''</p>
        <p>Now, he and others are turning Wildwood into Exhibit A in a national debate over the value of 50's and 60's architecture. ''For most preservationists, the period after World War II is a dead spot,'' said William C. Bolger of the National Park Service, which will hold a conference Oct. 11 to 13 in Philadelphia on ''Preserving the Recent Past.'' ''As the interest in fast food joints and the doo-wop stuff grows, I hear colleagues say they're getting out, that it's time to retire. But for people like me it gets the blood moving again.''</p>
        <p>Until recently, even the people who lived and worked here thought preservation was something suitable only for precious 18th-century villages and turn-of-the century mansions. ''Just a few years ago, when they saw the success of Cape May, they were saying: 'Hey, we have a few 19th-century buildings. Why don't we do our town over as a Victorian resort?' '' Mr. Hine said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Duane Sloan of Wildwood  recalls the debate: ''We came to the realization that we have our own unique character. We're not Cape May. We're not Ocean City. We're very Americana. We're not upper crust, and we don't want to be.''</p>
        <p>Many of those who vacation here are middle-class working people, said the mayor, 34, who was born and raised here. ''Wildwood is a fun kind of place,'' he said. ''We don't have any pretensions whatsoever.''</p>
        <p>Wildwood is a time capsule just cracked open. The motels are still motels, Mr. Hine explained, and they are still owned by individuals.</p>
        <p>''Wildwood is one of the last places where the chain motels haven't taken over, one of the last Mom and Pop places,'' said Richard Stokes, a Philadelphia architect involved in Wildwood's renewal. ''That's why it will never turn into a kind of theme park. We're hoping it will be recreated the same way it was created, by the moms and pops -- hopefully keeping its quirkiness.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stokes is helping Jack Morey, whose family owns four of Wildwood's five giant amusement piers, to ''reinvent'' the Starlux, a motel Mr. Morey bought recently. A down-at-the-heels brick box a few blocks from the ocean, the Starlux just got a wavy metal fence with Swiss cheese cutouts and a round glass tower for the reception desk. The small rooms have been redone with blond wood furniture and Lava lamps. Already, the motel is booked most weekends despite the $139 rate, almost twice what a night costs at the Bel-Air, an unrenovated gem nearer the water.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morey's family settled in Wildwood in the 1920's. In 1986, the Moreys built Seapointe Village, a 500-unit condominium at the south end of the beach. Jack Morey is also president of the Doo-Wop Preservation League, founded by Wildwood devotees in 1997. His family also financed a substantial chunk of the 104-page, visually frenetic master plan, written with help from design students at Yale, the University of Pennsylvania and Kent State.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morey says he likes the approach of architects like Mr. Izenour, who want to capture Wildwood's exuberant spirit. ''Guys like Steve, the only thing he wants to preserve is the spirit of zaniness,'' Mr. Morey said.</p>
        <p>What counts as zany? One student proposed beachfront changing rooms in the form of pastel soft ice cream cones with cherries on top. Another suggested marking intersections with ''giant inflatable kitsch beach creatures.'' Another student called for an allee of plastic palms, which Mr. Izenour hailed as ''very simple but immensely powerful,'' and ''Wildwood's equivalent of the great Hypostyle Hall at Karnak.''</p>
        <p>Despite its loud colors and Disneyesque touches, the plan has been well received, even among the most conservative motel owners, because the town is desperate for a fresh approach. Though a quarter of a million visitors descend on the Wildwoods every year, they come mainly in July and August -- and this July was a bad one, Mayor Sloan said. A 10-month-a-year infusion like the one in Cape May, a 10-minute drive away, is viewed as the only sure way to revive vacant storefronts and raise property values, which lag far behind those in nearby Avalon and Stone Harbor, rival beach communities where houses routinely sell for $400,000. (Wildwood's average is closer to $165,000.) While a few motel owners view doo-wop preservation as a gimmick, even they say that Wildwood is, in the end, different from a lot of other beach resorts.</p>
        <p>Because Wildwood has not changed -- really not changed. Incorporated in 1895, the town started skidding so quickly at the start of the 1970's that it remains virtually untouched. The motels have much the same look they did in the 1950's, 60's and 70's. You almost expect to see Sandra Dee, the star of ''Gidget,'' in a halter top, short shorts and strap sandals driving down Ocean Avenue and waving to her fans from a canary yellow '57 Chevy convertible.</p>
        <p>In fact, some say the revival began with old cars: each spring and autumn for eight years, the New Jersey Hot Rod Association has sponsored a car show along the two-and-half-mile boardwalk, creating a parade of pink and purple hot rods, muscle cars and Beach Boys convertibles.</p>
        <p>But to Wildwood's principal boosters, vintage wheels can carry the town only so far. ''The older folks tend to be more nostalgia based,'' Mr. Morey said. ''But if we focus on the old music and the old cars, you'll lose the younger people.''</p>
        <p>Wildwood really caught on as a place to study in 1995, when Daniel Vieyra, an architecture professor at Kent State, picked it as the location for a convention of the Society for Commercial Archaeology, a group devoted to the study of America's commercial roadside architecture.</p>
        <p>''It was simply the best collection of post-World War II resort architecture in the country,'' Mr. Vieyra said. ''It's all there: the critical mass, not one or two icons made cute.''</p>
        <p>Wildwood is also the only such collection in the country. (A boardwalk fire on Tuesday, which destroyed a two-story building, did not damage any doo-wop icons.) While one might have expected whole enclaves of 50's buildings in California, ''the West Coast is very fragmented and, anyway, has been gentrified beyond recognition,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vieyra asked Mr. Izenour to speak at the 1995 convention. Captivated, Mr. Izenour brought students from his classes at Yale and later from Penn. In July, Mr. Vieyra asked eight Kent State students to draft projects and work with motel owners to preserve the best of what they had while jazzing up some of the more mundane properties.</p>
        <p>The drive to keep the exuberance alive explains why no one is yet proposing plans for a historic district. ''There's a certain spontaneity here,'' Mr. Vieyra said. ''The question is whether you can use traditional preservation regulation without killing it, without freezing the place in time. Then you are a historian, not a designer, and that's an easy trap.''</p>
        <p>While most of Mr. Vieyra's students have been working on specific plans with motel and shop owners, the only doo-wop project that has been completed is Maureen's, a restaurant designed in the summer of 1999 by Michael Hill, a Kent State student, who took an existing brick box and decorated it with white mesh screen, brightly colored circles and martini glasses. Scheduled for construction in 2001 are a Wawa convenience store and a McDonald's.</p>
        <p>Still on the drawing boards are sketches of a 50's housewife who would hail tourists from the blue-and-white checked roof of an early 60's motel called the Cara Mara, and a replacement facade for a local Christmas shop, redoing it as a huge green package wrapped in bright red ribbon and layered with boomerang-shaped ornaments.</p>
        <p>''Wildwood is such a small town, the new design effort has so overwhelmed us,'' Mayor Sloan said of the academic attention focused on the town all summer. ''Wildwood was without direction for a long time, and this movement is the type of thing that gives a town direction.''</p>
        <p>Although Wildwood has been selected by the state for a new $70 million convention center, the mayor, Mr. Morey and others lament that they had no influence on the design: despite their lobbying, it is rising as a plain box, undoo-wopped. Both men are hoping to secure a $2.1 million federal grant to fix up the town's main shopping street, which is paved with bricks and lined with empty stores. ''There's no other way to put it,'' the mayor said. ''The downtown area has failed.''</p>
        <p>Asked how far the town has really come from its nadir in the mid-90's, Mr. Morey said, ''Maybe 10 percent.'' He paused. ''Maybe 20 percent. So many people left Wildwood. The young people moved away. But we want them back. Maybe someday they'll say, 'I miss Wildwood,' and then they'll come back.'' He paused again. ''Maybe.''</p>
