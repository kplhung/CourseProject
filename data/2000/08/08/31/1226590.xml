        <p>A decision by Australia to limit its cooperation with the United Nations on human rights reporting has reopened a debate about whether international monitors are sometimes harder on democracies than on closed societies.</p>
        <p>Some democracies, aware that information is more accessible and independent advocacy groups are more influential in their countries, are wary of the monitoring.</p>
        <p>In Australia, a campaign has been building for months to curb access to United Nations monitors after reports came out critical of the government's judicial treatment of Aborigines and foreigners who seek asylum.</p>
        <p>Politicians from Prime Minister John Howard's conservative Liberal Party have been particularly angry over criticisms from the United Nations Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination that relate to mandatory sentencing laws in Australia. The committee found that they fell hardest on Aborigines, some of them children.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Australia said that it would demand that United Nations monitors produce compelling reasons to visit Australia before granting permissions for fact-finding trips. The government also said it would reject requests from the United Nations to stay the deportation of unsuccessful asylum seekers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Howard told Parliament today that the decision to reduce cooperation did not amount to ''a turning away by Australia from the principles of the United Nations.''</p>
        <p>''But it does represent a determination by this government to ensure that matters affecting Australia are resolved by Australians within Australia,'' he said.</p>
        <p>United Nations human rights activities are fragmented. The office of the high commissioner for human rights is less than a decade old. An older group, the Human Rights Commission, is a body of government representatives that meets annually to hear reports from monitors assigned to specific countries or issues and may censure governments.</p>
        <p>Then there are treaty committees set up to monitor individual covenants against torture, on children's rights, on eliminating discrimination against women, on eliminating racial discrimination and on civil and political rights. Those are expert panels whose candidates are nominated by governments and elected by nations that have signed the relevant treaties or covenants.</p>
        <p>Only countries that have signed the treaties are required to submit reports for scrutiny, leaving some countries known for abuses free of monitoring. Other signing nations submit perfunctory or late reports or ignore the requirement altogether.</p>
        <p>Australia has been a strong supporter of the treaties and has submitted regular reports. The Australian decision to restrict cooperation was a shock for many rights groups. ''For the Australians, who have done so much to build the international human rights system and the treaty system, to say this is a particularly sad moment,'' said Felice Gaer, director of the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights and a member of the United Nations committee against torture.</p>
        <p>Of the 25 core treaties that Secretary General Kofi Annan has asked governments to sign or ratify next week at a summit meeting in New York, ''13 of them are human rights treaties,'' Ms. Gaer said. ''What kind of a message does this send to the rest of the world about the importance of global norms?''</p>
        <p>Australia's decision reflects opinions shared by some Americans who oppose what they see as a growing tendency toward international scrutiny. John Bolton of the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, a former assistant secretary of state in the Bush administration, said his objections were constitutional.</p>
        <p>''What Australia has done is a triumph for democracy,'' he said in an interview. ''Within a constitutional system of representative government, you're allowed to struggle for policy outcomes. In a democracy, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. What Australia is objecting to is the idea that a losing side in a democratic country can ask for a lifeline to a U.N. agency.''</p>
        <p>Speaking to Parliament today in Canberra, Mr. Howard contended that Australia, which has signed all the main human rights treaties, was under greater scrutiny than the United States and as much as Britain.</p>
