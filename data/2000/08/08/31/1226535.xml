        <p>I HAVE what has been described as a ''sconce problem,'' which explains why I like to loiter outside strangers' houses at dusk and peer through the windows at their lighting fixtures.</p>
        <p>The specialist who diagnosed this malady (my husband), has also formed some preliminary theories about a related condition he calls ''coveting your neighbors' furniture arrangements.'' He believes that both are incurable. The only recommended treatment is to take the dog along on these ''walks'' so you can establish a plausible excuse for lurking in case the police show up.</p>
        <p>But that was before Pottery Barn started a Web site this month. The site's Home Tour invites shoppers to examine a layout that shows the entire first floor of a real house (belonging to a family in Piedmont, Calif.,), then click on any room to start nosing around, I mean, touring the premises. It is a kind of home remedy for people like me who want not only to gaze through a stranger's windows, but also to get inside to take a closer look at those sconces flanking the fireplace in the living room.</p>
        <p>The idea behind the tour was to immerse a shopper in the atmosphere of an entire, real house, where it is possible to imagine oneself reading a book while lolling in the Marseilles Leather Armchair ($1,649) or rolling out pie dough on the Hampstead Marble-Top Prep Table ($699) in the kitchen. In some ways, this is much safer than my old method of snooping, because it will not lead to a misdemeanor charge. But it also has the potential to be far more dangerous for a longtime Pottery Barn addict like myself, because Pottery Barn replaced the real-life furniture (and sconces) with items that you can buy online.</p>
        <p>Of course, as a longtime customer -- I once considered a 12-step program to wean myself from compulsive purchases of the company's cotton velvet drapery panels -- I was dubious about whether the company's new online component would add anything to the tried-and-true Pottery Barn shopping experience.</p>
        <p>After all, for years I had been seeing products displayed in real-room settings in the company's catalogs.</p>
        <p>My skepticism was prompted by a twinge of resentment that I have been harboring toward Pottery Barn's parent company, Williams Sonoma. The company has been slow to start online shopping sites, a delay that has made it hard for online shoppers to compare prices.</p>
        <p>I do not want to sound whiny, but do you know what it is like, every time you stumble across a promising home-furnishing product online, to have to get up from the computer, walk down to the kitchen bookshelf, dig through catalogs to find the latest Pottery Barn offering, then page through the thing looking for some item -- a magazine rack, a cabinet knob -- that you vaguely remembered seeing?</p>
        <p>After causing me such pain, Pottery Barn thinks it can tardily waltz online and offer me a search function and all will be forgotten?</p>
        <p>''We wanted to take our time to focus on developing a model that would really work, to develop an online visual and shopping experience that would satisfy our customers,'' said Shelley Nandkeolyar, vice president of the eCommerce division at Williams Sonoma Inc.</p>
        <p>Grudgingly, I admitted the delay may have made business sense. Although many other online home-furnishing retailers are flailing -- Living.com went out of business earlier this month and Furniture.com barely avoided the same fate earlier this summer with a last-minute infusion of cash -- it is a good time for Potterybarn.com. Unlike those Internet upstarts, Pottery Barn sells a well-known brand, has plenty of inventory and has a reliable record when it comes to distribution and customer service.</p>
        <p>''People have purchased something from the company before and know that it's a quality product, but more important, that it's a quality shopping experience,'' said Barrett Ladd, a senior analyst at Gomez.com, which publishes reviews of online retailers. ''The important thing for them is to try to differentiate the Web site from what they already have in their catalog. They have to add something.''</p>
        <p>With that in mind, I took a closer look at the site, which had a clean design and simple, intuitive text and visual cues to aid navigation. With the search function it was a cinch to find information about any of the 3,000 products the company sells online. Another important customer service convenience: you can return any product you buy online to any of the 341 free-standing Pottery Barn stores.</p>
        <p>Using ''Home Tour,'' I examined the house from the vantage of someone who finally got inside a stranger's house.</p>
        <p>Although the verisimilitude of the experience would have been enhanced if there were a few pairs of children's shoes or some dog hair on the the rug, I was still having fun as I ran the cursor down the list of products for sale.</p>
        <p>I clicked ''Mica Sconce'' to read the description: ''Shades made of amber-toned mica, a thin material that creates warm ambient light.''</p>
        <p>At $89 each, I thought they might have been just what I was looking for if I did not already own three pairs of garage-sale sconces (including one set still packed away in a box).</p>
        <p>As I examined the Living Room more closely, I realized that the thing that originally had captured my interest when I started the Home Tour by peeping through the windows had been the beautiful built-in bookcases that flanked the sconces.</p>
        <p>Now, I know the architectural details in this house are not part of the Pottery Barn merchandise list. Still, I printed out the image to store in an already-bulging folder labeled ''Things to Ask the Carpenter to Copy.''</p>
        <p>My specialist thinks that folder might be evidence of another disease. But at least my sconce problem was in remission.</p>
