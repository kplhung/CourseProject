        <p>An August thunderstorm had just shredded the roof and walls of Raisa Go tsayeva's canvas tent, and she was airing out the bedding and washing the floorboards when a visitor came across her dirt threshold to inquire about conditions in the sea of tents here on the border with Chechnya.</p>
        <p>Set on the arid plain that sweeps up toward the Caucasus Mountains, barely visible in the distance, this makeshift camp in Ingushetia, which resembles an army bivouac, has taken the name Sputnik.</p>
        <p>''When I went to tell the authorities here that our tents are leaking, they simply replied, 'Why don't you go home?' '' she said, with a ring of indignation in her voice.</p>
        <p>She straightened her dress and motioned with more than a little exasperation at the clutter of bunks, clothes and cooking utensils that now defines her life, which she describes as ''sitting on suitcases.''</p>
        <p>''There is no other place I would rather go than home,'' said Ms. Go tsayeva, who fled Chechnya last October after Russian rockets destroyed the central market in Grozny, the capital. She had been selling clothes there when the rockets hit, killing 140 people.</p>
        <p>''I would go with great pleasure,'' she said. ''I would go tomorrow, but my house is destroyed, there is no work there, and every night there is shooting and they detain all the young men. If you have a beard, they say you are a rebel. If you have a cut or a scar, they say you are a rebel.</p>
        <p>''We would go home with pleasure. But we are afraid, and there are no guarantees there for our security.''</p>
        <p>After a year of fighting, Russia's armed forces have declared that the war against separatists in Chechnya is effectively over, with only ''mopping up'' operations continuing.</p>
        <p>Some 155,000 people are still refugees, and the task of returning them to their devastated land has confronted Moscow and international aid groups with another problem: almost no one wants to go home to a country where gunfire rules the night and where no family feels safe after reports of rape, torture and abuse by Russian military forces.</p>
        <p>Now another winter is coming, and hopes here are flagging. The mammoth relief effort that has sustained the Chechen refugee population is suffering from fatigue among donors. Bread distribution here was cut off for six weeks this summer because the Russian government failed to pay food vendors.</p>
        <p>The United Nations food relief coordinator for Russia, Bnim K. Udas, said in an interview that his program did not have enough food to get through September. A United Nations appeal for more food assistance to Chechen refugees was sent out in June, he said. ''But we have only received a response from the United States and Canada,'' he added. ''No other countries made pledges so far, including the European countries.''</p>
        <p>Ingushetia's top disaster coordinator, Valery Kuksa, told reporters earlier in August that about 50,000 refugees were living in tent camps and in abandoned train cars, but that this winter there would be spaces in warm tents for only about 25,000 refugees. He added that the ''official position'' of the Russian government was that ''by Oct. 1, all Chechens should be in Chechnya.''</p>
        <p>One government plan is to move the refugee camps just across the border into Chechnya, removing them from what they view as the protection of the Ingushetia government. In Chechnya, whether in camps or back home, they would be policed by the Russian Army and the Moscow-appointed administration of Akhmad Kadyrov.</p>
        <p>But the refugees here insist that they will not return to their republic until the shooting ends and the army stops inciting fear among civilians with late-night knocks on the door, incessant checkpoint searches, intimidation and extortion.</p>
        <p>The line between law enforcement and oppression in Chechnya is difficult to distinguish even from the official communiques.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 17, for example, a statement issued from the office of Sergei Yastrzhembsky, an aide to President Vladimir V. Putin, said 44 people had been arrested after ''search and raid operations'' in the villages of Alkhankala and Alkhan-Yurt in the preceding 24 hours. Those arrested included Chechens with ''scars from wounds'' and individuals who had secretly transported the bodies of rebels after they had been killed in battle -- presumably to carry out the tradition among the Muslim Chechens to bury them by sundown.</p>
        <p>''Kadyrov says come home, but how can we come home when the Russians promise endless mopping-up operations?'' said Taharik Vitaiyevo as she passed through a field of open latrines and outhouses. ''We would approve of Kadyrov if he would do something to end the war.''</p>
        <p>Every family at the Sputnik camp has a story. Many have sent family members back to Grozny this summer to conduct reconnaissance on whether it is safe to return. For most, the answer has been no.</p>
        <p>Zainab Ismailova, 41, arrived in Ingushetia on July 31 with her three children. On her first attempt to get here last December, the family narrowly escaped death when her refugee convoy was attacked by Russian helicopters, she said. Now, she is determined not to leave Ingushetia ''until I am sure that nothing will happen to my family when I return'' home.</p>
        <p>Sitting on a cot among her new neighbors, Mrs. Ismailova kept her eyes on her 2-year-old son, Islam. ''I left Grozny because of this child,'' she explained. ''During the whole war we stayed in the city, living in the cellar, but my son cannot stand to hear aviation noise anymore. He becomes paralyzed with fear.''</p>
        <p>Many children here suffer from nightmares and paralyzing fear. One father said his daughter passes out when she hears a jet or helicopter. A woman fears that her infant son has nerve damage, because his leg shakes when he sleeps.</p>
        <p>There is one tent where disturbed children are getting psychological counseling. They draw pictures: Grozny in flames, flowers coming out of cannons (titled ''The World as It Should Be''), a screaming girl with body parts around her and a devastated landscape called ''Bloody Sunday in the City of Shali.''</p>
        <p>''These children have seen a great deal of evil in the last year,'' said Khamila Khadisova, a Chechen schoolteacher working with the children.</p>
        <p>Not far from here, in the village of Gamuriyevo, 100 Chechens have moved into an abandoned house. All that was left by the time Zarima Dzaitayev, 44, and her husband showed up was the garage, which they share with 10 other people.</p>
        <p>''I returned to our home near Grozny recently,'' Mrs. Dzaitayev said. ''It was an apartment building, and now two of the entrances have collapsed and there is nothing left.</p>
        <p>''We would like to go home, even if we had to live in the basement, but it is impossible because someone shoots at night, or the soldiers come to you drunk and ask for money or vodka,'' she said, adding, ''My daughter is 17 and I don't want to take her there.''</p>
        <p>For now, Mrs. Dzaitayev and her husband, a construction engineer who worked for the Chechen government and who has not been paid in three years, will remain in the garage. They sleep on mats on the concrete floor with their children.</p>
        <p>''Last winter my mother died and we had to take her home to bury her,'' Mrs. Dzaitayev said, ''but at the checkpoints the Russians suspected we were smuggling weapons, because my mother's body was wrapped in a blanket, and so we had to unwrap her to show them and then pay a bribe.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Dzaitayev began to cry, interrupting herself to say: ''Not every Chechen is a bandit. Every nation has good and bad people in it, but they call us a criminal nation, and it is not right.''</p>
