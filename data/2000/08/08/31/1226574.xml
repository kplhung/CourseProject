        <p>For the first time in Mississippi's history, state lawmakers were called on early this year to choose the next governor.

        <p>For the first time in Mississippi's history, state lawmakers were called on early this year to choose the next governor. No candidate had reached the 50 percent plus one required to win the popular vote, and so the election went to the House of Representatives, where the outcome was far more certain. Overwhelmingly Democratic, the House made Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove the winner over his Republican opponent, Mike Parker, a former congressman.</p>
        <p>It is upon such thin reeds that Democrats are building their hopes of making even a dent this fall in the Republican Party's 30-to-18 advantage in governorships. (Maine has an  independent as governor, Angus  King, and Minnesota has Jesse Ventura, now with the Minnesota Independence Party.)</p>
        <p>Only 11 states are holding elections for governor in November. By all accounts most of the races are too close to call, but the biggest swing that either party realistically envisions is two or three seats either way. The real test of the parties' struggle for the nation's statehouses  is not likely to come until the off-year elections of 2002, with governors' races in 36 states.</p>
        <p>It was the elections in those states in 1994 that dug the hole from which the Democrats are now trying to emerge. Two years into President Clinton's first term, a restless electorate not only delivered control of both houses of Congress to Republicans for the first time in 40 years but also turned the Democrats' 30-to-18 advantage in governorships into a 30-to-19 lead for Republicans.</p>
        <p>In 1996 and again in 1998, the Republicans extended their advantage by one, to give them 32 governors, a 50-year high for the party.</p>
        <p>Now, with Republicans holding slimmer margins in Congress and Vice President Al Gore edging ahead of Gov. George W. Bush in some national polls, Democrats say the time is right for them to reclaim some of the executive offices they have lost in recent years.</p>
        <p>''If I were making book, I'd say we will pick up one to three seats this year and will very likely pick up two,'' said Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky, chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association. ''Then I'd expect to pick up another one next year.''</p>
        <p>Democrats are defending governorships this fall in Delaware, Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Vermont and Washington. Republicans are defending in Montana, North Dakota, Utah and West Virginia.</p>
        <p>In 2001, only New Jersey and Virginia will have races for governor, and in both the office is now held by  Republicans barred from seeking re-election. Democrats view their chances as especially strong in New Jersey, where James E. McGreevey, who barely lost to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in 1997, has time to generate money and support while Republicans fight over which of  three candidates will oppose him.</p>
        <p>Republican officials brush off any projections of significant Democratic gains, contending that more Republicans are elected as governor these days because voters prefer them. Republicans also say they are encouraged because the four Democratic governors who this year are seeking another term -- Frank L. O'Bannon in Indiana, Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, Howard Dean in Vermont and Gary Locke in Washington -- are all facing Republican opposition that is stronger than first expected.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to just say we're better than them,'' said Clinton Key, executive director of the Republican Governors' Association. ''Our guys get it. We have a group of truly talented people who know how to get elected and get things accomplished. Our attractiveness is as high as it's ever been.''</p>
        <p>With only a relative handful of elections this year, it is difficult to discern an overriding theme. Issues like education and taxes have dominated the political discourse among most candidates, but the particular  needs and nature of each of the states tend to keep them from being meaningfully linked.</p>
        <p>''Gubernatorial candidates are going to be evaluated on their own merits more so than how some candidate performs in a neighboring state,'' said Thomas M. Carsey, associate professor of political science at Florida State University and author of a new book, ''Campaign Dynamics: The Race for Governor.''</p>
        <p>One variable, particularly in the close races, is the effect of the presidential election. A strong Democratic turnout for Mr. Gore in West Virginia, where Representative Bob Wise, a nine-term Democrat, is challenging Gov. Cecil H. Underwood, could help Mr. Wise in one of the six races for governor rated a tossup by The Cook Political Report. The other tossup states, where presidential fortunes could play a role, are Delaware, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina and North Dakota.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, a strong showing in Indiana by Mr. O'Bannon, who is leading his Republican challenger, Representative David M. McIntosh, in recent polls, could help Mr. Gore win a state that has voted for only two Democratic presidential nominees in 100 years, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson.</p>
