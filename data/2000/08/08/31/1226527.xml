        <p>THIS election year, if you visit a Web site created by any group with political interests, you will probably have a chance to register to vote as well.</p>
        <p>Links to voter registration sites are appearing on the Web sites of candidates, political parties, groups for teenagers and even on a site for a Jeep owners' club.</p>
        <p>But the registration process is not as simple as clicking on Send. Because signatures are required on voter registration cards, online systems often merely start a process that must be completed by mail.</p>
        <p>The Federal Election Commission offers a postcard form at www.fec.gov/votregis /vr.htm that can be printed, filled out, signed and mailed. Printed on ordinary paper, the form is accepted by about half the states. But most others mail a registration card to the individual to sign and return.</p>
        <p>Still other sites, like BeAVoter.org and Election.com, let prospective voters type information into electronic forms. The information is then put on registration cards and  mailed to the registrants for signatures. The next step, allowing people to register directly online using digital signatures, does not seem likely in the near future.</p>
        <p>Privacy experts have warned that plugging information into an online form could lead to problems. Even though the commercial and nonprofit voter registration sites have policies that say the groups do not sell personal data, bankruptcy proceedings and mergers can nullify those policies.</p>
        <p>Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit group, said she was most concerned that commercial entities would link data about political leanings with consumer data.</p>
        <p>''It's really important that voters be very conscientious about what kinds of sites they use to facilitate their voter registration,'' Ms. Alexander said.</p>
        <p>The election commission has offered its form for printing online for more than two years. The form is downloaded about 15,000 times per month, said Brian Hancock, an elections research specialist for the commission. The agency does not know how many people have actually registered.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the number of registration forms filed at motor vehicle offices around the nation under so-called motor voter laws has been far greater, totaling more than 15 million in 1997 and 1998.</p>
        <p>Turnout among voters has dropped substantially. The number of registered voters increased by more than 11 million people from 1992 to 1996, but the percentage of people voting dropped to 49 percent in 1996 from 55 percent in 1992. Offering registration forms online is not likely to change that trend, experts said.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's going to be a revolution,'' said Curtis Gans, director of the nonprofit Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. Technology, Mr. Gans said, would not correct the problems created by poor civic education and negative campaigning. ''When we correct some of those things,'' he said, ''then perhaps we can rebuild the motivation to vote.''</p>
