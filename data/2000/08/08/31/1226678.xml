        <p>TENNIS fans who dislike the temper tantrums thrown by some top players over line umpires' calls can thank Bill Carlton that there aren't more of them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carlton, an inventor from Malta, developed a system called the Cyclops by Carlton, a service line monitor that uses infrared beams to determine whether a serve is in or out.</p>
        <p>The Cyclops, which was developed about two decades ago and has been refined continually since then, is now used in many major tournaments, including Wimbledon and the United States Open, which is taking place this week and next at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Line umpires say the system helps relieve some of the pressure when calling serves.</p>
        <p>''As an umpire, I loved it,'' said Jay Snyder, tournament director at the United States Tennis Association. ''Probably the most argued-over call in tennis is the serve because it's so split-second. But the players don't argue with the Cyclops. They've come to accept it.''</p>
        <p>Although there are no published accuracy statistics, Mr. Snyder said that Cyclops's calls were accurate more than 99 percent of the time, barring extreme temperature changes that can affect the court surface.</p>
        <p>Other umpires appreciate the system's objectivity in situations where they could be accused of favoritism.</p>
        <p>''The machine doesn't care whether you're from Spain or from Los Angeles,'' said Brian Early, a referee with the United States Tennis Association. ''It just calls the balls the way it is, and that's fine.''</p>
        <p>Before the United States Open gets under way each year at the National Tennis Center, Bill Carlton's daughter, Sarah Gauci Carlton, arrives from Malta to set up Cyclops systems on center court and on three others where marquee matches are played. Ms. Carlton stays through the tournament to maintain the systems and make adjustments.</p>
        <p>The U.S.T.A., which started using Cyclops for the Open in 1981, rents the systems from the Carltons. Cyclops is also used at Wimbledon and the Australian Open.</p>
        <p>The Cyclops system consists of two boxes bolted to the court surface on the sidelines, in line with the back of the service box. One of the Cyclops boxes transmits five infrared beams across the court to the other box, which is the receiver and is connected to a smaller control box held by the service line umpire. There is an identical setup on the other side of the net.</p>
        <p>The boxes are positioned so one infrared beam runs along the good side of the service box line, and the other four run on the fault side, up to 18 inches from the line. When a ball hits on the line (or just inside the line) it momentarily breaks the first beam and turns off the others. If the serve is long, it breaks one of the four other beams.</p>
        <p>The control box signals with a green light when the serve breaks the first beam. It it breaks any of the others without breaking the first beam, it signals with a red light and a loud beep. A serve well beyond or in front of the beams is considered easy enough for the umpire to judge by eye.</p>
        <p>The Cyclops can be used only at the service line because, unlike the baselines or sidelines, there are no feet or rackets present to break the infrared beams. The system must be inactivated (the umpire pushes a button on the control box) immediately after a good serve so the ball, racket or feet do not trip the beams again, triggering more beeps.</p>
        <p>Another system, called Tennis Electronic Lines, was installed to monitor baseline activity at the United States Open in the early 1990's, Mr. Snyder said, but it was unsuccessful. The system used metal sensors under the court lines and a tennis ball with metallic fibers to determine the ball's location. The system was expensive, and it was frequently set off by players who had metal eyelets in their tennis shoes or metallic fibers in their rackets.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the Cyclops system has been redesigned to be less sensitive to insects attracted by the lights that are used for night games, Mr. Snyder said. And the whistle that was initially used to indicate a fault has been replaced by a lower-pitched beep, partly because it can be heard better in large stadiums and partly because some spectators would occasionally mimic the whistle sound when they thought that a ball was out.</p>
        <p>As precise as it is, the Cyclops system is used to complement, not replace, people. The line umpire has the final call and can shut down the system if there are questions about its accuracy. That rarely happens.</p>
        <p>At the end of each match of the Open, Ms. Carlton speaks to the service-line umpire about how well the system worked. ''There are a few linesmen who are more particular than others, but very few who don't like it, she said.''</p>
