        <p>CALLAHAN-Inez Zucker. Wife and adored companion of Joseph Callahan for forty years, died on August 29th after her heroic struggle with cancer. Inez, a terrific raconteur, charmed the world with her beauty, brilliance and extraordinary wit. Like her father, the renowned Ecole de Paris artist Jacques Zucker, Inez was a talented artist; the high-cheek boned velvety beauty came from her mother Nina Zucker. Inez's early childhood was in Paris, Israel and New York. After World War II Inez returned to Paris with her parents and her brother John Zucker. Her friends from her youthful Paris days, Marie-Christiene Choukroun, Barbara Probst Solomon and Joyce Brawer, forever will remember her as an ebuillient girl who danced the tango and pasadobles with a rose pinned in her hair; her brother John and her cousins and closest of friends Meno and Nili Shir and her friend Marvin Raeburn will forever miss her good-humored all-embracing love. A world traveler and linguist, Inez's forty years work with BOAC permitted her and Joe Callahan to have friends not only in New York where they lived and in her beloved Puerta Vallarta, but all over the world. The memorial will be next month.</p>
