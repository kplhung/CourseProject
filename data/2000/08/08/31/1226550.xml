        <p>After almost a year of dribbling out bits and bytes of information about a collaboration with Palm Inc., Sony announced this week that its sleek, new personal digital assistant would go on sale next month. And the device, which will have lithium-rechargeable batteries and a gray-scale display (color is in the works), finally has a name: CLIE (pronounced KLEE-ay). Advance orders can be placed at www.sony.com/clie.  CLIE is an acronym, for communication, link, information and entertainment.</p>
        <p>Using the Palm operating system licensed from Palm Inc., the CLIE features applications commonly found on Palms, like electronic address books, calendars, to-do lists and easy synchronization with personal computers and laptops.</p>

        <p>After almost a year of dribbling out bits and bytes of information about a collaboration with Palm Inc., Sony announced this week that its sleek, new personal digital assistant would go on sale next month. And the device, which will have lithium-rechargeable batteries and a gray-scale display (color is in the works), finally has a name: CLIE (pronounced KLEE-ay). Advance orders can be placed at www.sony.com/clie.  CLIE is an acronym, for communication, link, information and entertainment.</p>
        <p>Using the Palm operating system licensed from Palm Inc., the CLIE features applications commonly found on Palms, like electronic address books, calendars, to-do lists and easy synchronization with personal computers and laptops.</p>
        <p>But the CLIE's designers say they have tweaked the Palm system to add functions. For instance, the device can store and play back short video clips and can place names with pictures of faces in its address book.</p>
        <p>Many of the CLIE's distinctive features are made possible because of Memory Sticks, Sony's solid-state removable storage medium. A stick  may be inserted into a slot on top of the slender (five-eighths of an inch) device. The device comes with 8 megabytes of internal memory, more than most Palms, and an 8-megabyte Memory Stick. Additional Memory Sticks for the CLIE come in 16, 32 and 64 megabytes, with a 128-megabyte version scheduled for release, Sony executives said. Functions that may soon be added to the CLIE through special Memory Stick expansion modules include a camera, a Global Positioning System tracker and a voice recorder.</p>
        <p>''With the CLIE handheld,'' said Russell Paik, vice president for handheld marketing at Sony Electronics, ''Sony is continuing to pioneer the integration of entertainment with clever, functional and elegant electronics devices.''</p>
