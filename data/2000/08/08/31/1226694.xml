        <p>When Bob and Mike Bryan drew a seeded doubles opponent in the first round of the United States Open six years ago, they were 17 years old and just happy to be there. The second year, the identical twins from California thought it was strange. When it happened for a fifth straight year they were blown away.</p>
        <p>They lost all five matches.</p>
        <p>This year, when Bob saw they would be playing the sixth-seeded team, he laughed. ''Guess who we're playing?'' he shouted to his brother, who was in the shower.</p>
        <p>''A seed, right?'' Mike yelled back. It was a good guess. The brothers, who left Stanford after their sophomore year, calculated that the odds were nearly 1 in 4,000 of drawing a seeded opponent in six straight years.</p>
        <p>''It's just weird,'' Mike said, shaking his head after defeating the South African duo of David Adams and John Laffnie de Jager, 6-4, 7-6 (6). ''It's a jinx.''</p>
        <p>''It's destiny,'' Bob said.</p>
        <p>Finally they had won a match at the Open. The brothers screamed, then slammed together in a chest bump and raised their arms to the crowd.</p>
        <p>''When we came here the first few years, we were just so in awe of it and we were so small,'' Mike said.</p>
        <p>At 17, the brothers who often finish each other's sentences were star-struck, staring wide-eyed as stars like Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras wandered by. At 21, they weren't much different. At 22, they decided it was time for a change.</p>
        <p>For the first time, they are staying in Queens instead of the Manhattan hotel with the rest of the players. They have not gone to see other matches. After five years, they have learned what to do. And they have an idea how to break that other streak.</p>
        <p>''Next year,'' Bob said, grinning, ''we're going to be the seeds.''</p>
        <p>Achieving Olympic Dream</p>
        <p>Jeff Tarango waited for two weeks to receive the call telling him he was on the Olympic team. But really, Tarango had been waiting for 12 years.</p>
        <p>In 1988, he was the No. 1 amateur in the world, but since tennis allows professionals to play in the Olympics, Tarango was left off the team.</p>
        <p>Now, at 31 and ranked 78th in the world, he has another chance and will not let the United States Open interfere.</p>
        <p>Tarango and Jens Knippschild advanced in doubles yesterday with a 6-3, 7-6 (4) victory over 10th-seeded Joshua Eagle and Andrew Florent from Austria, but he was eliminated Monday from the singles competition by the qualifier Hyung Taik-Lee, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (6).</p>
        <p>''This is the 12th time I've played the U.S Open and I've never played the Olympics,'' Tarango said with a shrug and a smile.</p>
        <p>There were no fits after the first-round loss by Tarango, who in the past dropped his shorts in a 1994 loss to Michael Chang and walked out of a third-round match at Wimbledon a year later because he felt the umpire was unfairly penalizing him.</p>
        <p>No matter what, Tarango said, he will play as hard as he can in Sydney, Australia, harder than he has at the Open. ''If I have to be taken out on a stretcher, that's cool,'' he said. ''I'm going to run for every single ball that's out there.''</p>
