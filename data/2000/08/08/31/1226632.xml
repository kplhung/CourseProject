        <p>A federal judge has overturned the death sentence of a Texas man convicted of killing a 16-year-old boy, citing the ''dismal'' performance of the convicted man's lawyer during his trial as well as the prosecution's failure to disclose to jurors that an important  witness was a paid informer.</p>
        <p>The judge, David Folsom of Federal District Court in Texarkana, Tex., ruling on a motion filed four years ago, left intact the conviction of Delma Banks Jr. for the April 1980 murder of Richard Wayne Whitehead. At Mr. Banks's trial, prosecutors argued that he shot Mr. Whitehead in Nash, Tex., and then stole his car to drive to Dallas.</p>
        <p>But Judge Folsom ordered the state either to reduce Mr. Banks's sentence or to order a new sentencing trial within 120 days.</p>
        <p>The ruling endorsed the findings of a federal magistrate, Caroline Malone, who in May cited the poor job by Mr. Banks's lawyer and the prosecution's failure to disclose that one of its witnesses, Robert Farr, was a paid informer.</p>
        <p>Judge Folsom's ruling was issued on Aug. 18 but was first reported today in The Texarkana Gazette. The judge cited the magistrate's finding of ''a reasonable probability that but for the errors and omissions of trial counsel at the punishment phase, combined with the state's failure to disclose Farr as a paid informant, the outcome of Banks's punishment phase would have been different.''</p>
        <p>The magistrate also stated that ''the state's failure to disclose Farr's informant status, coupled with trial counsel's dismal performance during the punishment phase, undermined the reliability of the jury's verdict regarding punishment.''</p>
        <p>Clifton L. Holmes, a Longview, Tex., defense lawyer who is one of Mr. Banks's appeal lawyers, said Mr. Banks's trial lawyer did ''very little preparation in terms of preparing for the punishment trial and introducing those kinds of things that all courts recognize as mitigating factors, such as the condition of his upbringing and the like.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Banks was to be retried to determine whether he was to be executed by lethal injection, he would stand a good chance of receiving only prison time, Mr. Holmes said. He contended that evidence collected since the trial cast doubt on the conviction, and he said Mr. Banks had not been a dangerous or violent inmate in his 20 years on death row, making it difficult for prosecutors to argue that he was a danger to society.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Banks is not sentenced to death, he could be eligible for parole, based on the time he has spent in prison, the Bowie County district attorney, Bobby Lockhart, told The Gazette.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart, who did not return a telephone call seeking comment, told the newspaper that ''we feel like he'd be eligible for parole right now.'' He said that his office planned to appeal Judge Folsom's ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and that he would leave the decision of whether to retry Mr. Banks to Mr. Whitehead's family and to one of his assistant prosecutors.</p>
        <p>''I can't imagine any reason why we wouldn't retry it,'' Mr. Lockhart told the newspaper.</p>
        <p>The competency of lawyers who represent indigent defendants in capital cases in Texas has become a political issue this year. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee, has strongly defended the state's death penalty system as fair.</p>
        <p>Critics argue that many defendants receive inadequate counsel, including at least three widely publicized cases of lawyers who have slept through parts of the proceedings.</p>
        <p>The state appeals court has reversed only 8 death penalty verdicts in the last five years, while affirming the convictions and death sentences in 256 cases, according to court statistics. This is the lowest reversal rate in capital cases in the country.</p>
        <p>Florida, which ranks behind Texas with the nation's third highest death row population, has a 50 percent reversal rate.</p>
        <p>Judge Folsom's ruling was on a writ of habeas corpus, a motion that seeks court review of an imprisonment. Such petitions are common in death-penalty cases, but are not often granted. But Maurie Levin, a lawyer at the Texas Defender Service in Austin, which represents indigent death-row inmates, said federal judges in Texas had granted some form of habeas relief in at least two other death penalty cases this year.</p>
        <p>The habeas rulings, Ms. Levin said, ''underscore and exemplify the errors in the system and the need for the kind of advocacy'' during the appeals process that revealed errors at trial.</p>
