        <p>On Monday in a steamy union hall in Chicago, some 1,300 rowdy Democrats roared the now-ritualistic chant ''Go, Joe, go!'' as Mayor Richard M. Daley and the other big wheels of the Chicago Democratic machine escorted Senator Joseph I. Lieberman to the stage.</p>

        <p>On Monday in a steamy union hall in Chicago, some 1,300 rowdy Democrats roared the now-ritualistic chant ''Go, Joe, go!'' as Mayor Richard M. Daley and the other big wheels of the Chicago Democratic machine escorted Senator Joseph I. Lieberman to the stage.</p>
        <p>Handing his rumpled jacket to an aide, Mr. Lieberman began a folksy stump speech that was interrupted by applause, laughter and more chanting. When he stepped off the stage to shake hands, people surged forward. Men clapped him on the back. Women leaned in with kisses and whispered words of encouragement in Hebrew.</p>
        <p>The next morning, 400 miles away in Kansas City, Mo., fewer than 75 people waited for Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice president, to speak at the headquarters of Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Most of those in the audience were employees of the organization. They sat in polite silence. There were no campaign signs. Mr. Cheney and his wife, Lynne, entered the hall unannounced; for a painful minute, there was no response until a few people realized they ought to clap.</p>
        <p>A few introductory speakers talked about the importance of faith and abstinence, and Mike Sweeney, first baseman for the Kansas City Royals, gave Mr. Cheney a jersey. Another moment of awkward silence followed before Mr. Cheney began a brief, low-key speech about teaching children the importance of character -- ''It's about what you do when nobody is looking.'' Then he sat back down to brief, low-key applause.</p>
        <p>With Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas entering a crucial phase of their race for the White House, their running mates are waging starkly different campaigns as they strike out on their own for the first time since each party's national convention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, who has confronted questions about his health, his voting record in Congress and his multimillion-dollar retirement package from a major oil services corporation, has largely kept a low profile, staging small events, sticking to a familiar speech script and generally staying clear of reporters from national news organizations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has been more active, drawing far larger crowds and attracting -- indeed courting -- more media coverage. On Monday in Chicago, his motorcade included two vans filled with reporters, most from national news organizations, who are flying with him on his campaign airplane. Mr. Cheney's campaign has no accommodations for a traveling press corps at this time. National reporters follow his campaign by taking commercial flights and taxicabs to his events.</p>
        <p>Last week, when Mr. Cheney finally took questions from the national press corps on the last day of a three-day trip through California and Oregon, he found only three journalists facing him. ''Why do I need a press secretary if I've only got three?'' he said jokingly to his press secretary, Dirk Vande Beek.</p>
        <p>After his event on Tuesday, Mr. Cheney paused briefly to take questions from reporters. When one tried to ask a follow-up question, Mr. Cheney cut her off, saying, ''You had your question.''</p>
        <p>After four questions, Mr. Vande Beek ended the interview. Trying for a fifth question, a reporter asked Mr. Cheney how he planned to celebrate his 36th wedding anniversary.</p>
        <p>''That,'' Mr. Cheney said, ''is a secret.''</p>
        <p>He did answer one question about the differences between his campaign style and Mr. Lieberman's.</p>
        <p>''It's sort of in keeping with my quiet, low-key demeanor,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''I come from the West. A man of few words. Grew up in the House of Representatives where we are limited to five minutes in our speeches. Joe's from Connecticut. He comes from the Senate, where they make a lot longer speeches.''</p>
        <p>But he firmly rejected what has become conventional political wisdom among even some Republicans -- that while Mr. Lieberman is helping Mr. Gore, Mr. Cheney is not yet doing the same for Mr. Bush, whose standing in the polls has sagged since his selection of Mr. Cheney.</p>
        <p>''People seem to respond favorably to my being on the ticket,'' Mr. Cheney said, adding, ''I don't want to take personal credit or blame for what happens in the polls.''</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Cheney's taste for the low profile sometimes fails to grab headlines or move polls, Mr. Lieberman's high-profile appearances have risks of their own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman demonstrated this on Sunday in Detroit, when his assertion that religion is the basis of morality drew a strong rebuke from the Anti-Defamation League, atheists and groups that advocate a strict separation of church and state.</p>
        <p>An earlier appearance before the black caucus of the Democratic National Committee served to highlight Mr. Lieberman's past differences with black leaders about affirmative action and school vouchers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's restrained style, meanwhile, reinforces what many consider to be his strongest contribution to Mr. Bush: his reputation as a senior statesman with the depth of experience to offset Mr. Bush's relative lack of exposure to military issues, foreign affairs and the ways of Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's understatement has also added a quiet potency to his criticisms of Mr. Gore and President Clinton, not to mention his calls for a restoration of honor in the Oval Office, a line that drew roars of approval from party stalwarts at the Republican National Convention.</p>
        <p>Only yesterday, in a campaign event in Atlanta, Mr. Cheney drew on his experience as secretary of defense in the Bush administration to accuse Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore of presiding over a military that is ''overused and under-resourced.''</p>
        <p>''Since 1990,'' he said, ''America has pursued a strategy that would allow us to fight two wars simultaneously, and win both decisively, with the lowest possible risk to our troops.</p>
        <p>''Yet just last fall, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified that the risk involved in two wars has increased, and would now be 'moderate' risk in the first, and 'high' risk in the second. And how would that risk be measured? Ultimately, it's measured in the lives of our troops.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has also chosen to adopt an understated tone when laying into Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney. He usually sets up his sharpest criticisms by first declaring that both men are ''decent and honorable.'' And after he delivers a zinger, he tends to soften the blow by smiling and raising his eyebrows, as if to ask, ''Wasn't that a good one?''</p>
        <p>But on the stump, Mr. Lieberman differs most from Mr. Cheney in his eagerness to place his life story at the center of his political message. He never fails to remind audiences that he is the son of a bakery truck driver, that his wife's parents escaped the death camps in Germany, and the communists in Czechoslovakia, that he was the first person in his family to graduate from college, that he went to Mississippi in 1963 to fight for voting rights for black people.</p>
        <p>At nearly every stop he speaks of his religion, and about how his status as the first Jew on a presidential ticket means that ''doors of opportunity'' have opened for all who have faced discrimination.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney is not nearly so effusive. After he addressed a chapter of the Future Farmers of America at Crater High School in Medford, Ore., a student asked him what most politicians would consider the easiest of softballs.</p>
        <p>''My question for you is, Who are you?'' the boy asked. ''What do you like to do on the weekends? What are your hobbies, and where do you like to travel?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney might have used the moment to tell some dramatic stories about perhaps his greatest professional triumph, victory in the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>Instead, he gave a bare-bones recitation of his resume -- schools attended, jobs held, number of children and grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Hobbies? ''You can usually find me if I have some time off with either a fly rod or a shotgun in my hand.'' And that was about it.</p>
        <p>A Cheney spokeswoman, Juleanna Glover Weiss, said yesterday that Mr. Cheney would soon play a more visible role. Ms. Weiss said reporters would be able to fly with Mr. Cheney sometime next week.</p>
        <p>''Secretary Cheney looks forward to many long and fruitful conversations with the national reporters in the back of the plane,'' she said. ''He's one of those guys that the more you see, the more you like.''</p>
