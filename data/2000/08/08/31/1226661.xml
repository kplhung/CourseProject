        <p>It was long after she impressively tucked away her 21st match in a row, but Venus Williams was still on her game inside the National Tennis Center, still delivering returns with the speed of a quick wit.</p>
        <p>This is how you handle a heckler, and this is how she put away John McEnroe.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the comments McEnroe made in this week's issue of The New Yorker -- where he declared the dominant Williams sisters could be beaten by a male college player or any man on the senior tour (like him) -- made their way to Venus Williams. Instead of taking offense to remarks that belittle her achievements, Williams took the challenge with a good rip at humor.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if I could fit him in my schedule right now,'' Williams said when asked about a battle-of-the-sexes match with McEnroe. ''I don't think it's fair to put a 20-year-old against a 40-something person. So, I'll let that pass.''</p>
        <p>She was in too good a mood to let anyone spoil it. With the same ease top-seeded Martina Hingis displayed when she maneuvered past the American Kristina Brandi, 6-1, 6-1, with the same unflappable form fourth-seeded Pete Sampras used as he dashed the spirits of Morristown, N.J.'s Justin Gimelstob, 6-3, 6-1, 6-3, Williams unnerved Kveta Hrdlickova with the might of her lumberjack strokes.</p>
        <p>It took just 48 minutes to put a 6-1, 6-1 exclamation mark to Williams current roll. So, Williams couldn't help finding the lighter side of Day 3 at the United States Open. After exiting the interview room, she stopped and posed for a picture, gave the lens a bright, crescent-moon smile, and all but skipped toward the locker room.</p>
        <p>For most of the day there was a feel-good atmosphere hanging over the grounds. In the same hallway, a happy Jennifer Capriati was spotted embracing her boyfriend Xavier Malisse. She wished him good luck just before she went off to win her second-round match inside Louis Armstrong Stadium, while Malisse departed for Court 10, where he took his first-round victory.</p>
        <p>''It's hard when we play at the same time,'' Malisse said. ''I want to see her, and she wants to be at my match. She finished first. So, I liked seeing her come in.''</p>
        <p>But there was a limit to the positive vibes. Outside the players' cafeteria, Jelena Dokic was seen crying. It was her father again. As a reminder of the dysfunctional dark side of tennis, Damir Dokic was making a scene for the second Grand Slam event in a row. At Wimbledon, he went on a tirade as he made his way through the pristine grounds, ending his unruly behavior by smashing the cell phone of a reporter before security people led him away.</p>
        <p>It was uncertain what triggered that outburst. This time, it was the price of salmon. Apparently outraged at the cost of lunch in the players' cafeteria, Dokic went off on a shouting binge until security officers hustled him away. His daughter was the teary-eyed witness to it all.</p>
        <p>''To be honest, I feel sorry for her,'' a fellow Aussie, Mark Philippoussis, said. ''She should be enjoying herself. When I played mixed doubles with her at Hopman Cup, she didn't look like a happy 16-year-old girl. She's not. She's not smiling.''</p>
        <p>The vision of Jelena Dokic provided a dose of reality to an otherwise lighthearted day. Although the wild-card entrant Mardy Fish, an affable 18-year-old from Vero Beach, Fla., could not fight off the popular Jan-Michael Gambill in the fifth set, his growing cult following was pleased. In the stands of Louis Armstrong Stadium, the Fish Heads, as his fans are known, were cheering.</p>
        <p>''In the beginning I tried to get the crowd on my side because I knew I would need them if it went long,'' said Fish, who heard the crowd chanting his name. ''It helped a lot. I had my mom, my sister and my dad here.''</p>
        <p>There is such a thing as a normal tennis family. But there are certain parents who stand out on their own. Damir Dokic is one of them. And the father of Venus and Serena Williams, Richard, is another. But even though the eccentric Richard Williams has been an attention-grabber at times -- making outrageous statements and waving signs -- he is harmless. He is not a hovering, overbearing parent, but one who encourages his daughters to develop individuality.</p>
        <p>They are independent, and perfectly capable of handling themselves. Venus Williams was proof of that yesterday. She didn't need anyone to defend her against McEnroe's opinions; she had her own thoughts as to whether McEnroe or a male college player could beat her.</p>
        <p>''If you're playing a college player, they just aren't as smart,'' Williams explained. ''They don't understand what it is to be at 30-all, 40-all in a big situation. They don't understand these things. So, therefore, . . . Well, I've played a lot of guys that were stronger than me, and I was smarter. But this is not important. I have a career, and it's very successful.''</p>
        <p>She had a point. Williams is on the kind of streak many, including McEnroe, might envy.</p>
        <p>''Martina Navratilova went a year and she lost only one match,'' Williams said when asked if a Tiger Woods-type roll was possible.</p>
        <p>''When Monica Seles was out in the early 90's, she had all types of winning streaks. And Steffi won four Grand Slams in one year, plus the Olympics,'' she said of Steffi Graf.</p>
        <p>For now, Williams will stick to those goals, and leave the struggling men's tour on their own.</p>
        <p>''I'm a lady,'' Williams said. ''I don't want to play with the men's tour. The ladies' tour is where it's good to be at right now. I want to be right here.''</p>
        <p>Good comeback.</p>
