        <p>The men who wrote the Constitution faced a choice: Either establish a church, as some of the colonies had done, or provide for religious toleration. They chose the way of nonestablishment. This seemed a good choice, and it worked well throughout most of the 19th century and well into the 20th.</p>
        <p>True, a mild kind of civil religion was accepted. Enlightenment politicians in America, some of whom were believers, thought religion useful for the support of the Republic. Early documents of the new country emphasized strong religious commitment: for example, the Declaration of Independence and Washington's Inaugural Address.</p>
        <p>But the God of early American politics was somewhat impersonal and detached, described in rather general terms as ''the Creator,'' ''the Invisible,'' ''the Almighty Being.''</p>
        <p>With time, relationships between God and American politicians became more personal, as manifest in the exchange of endorsements -- the politician usually endorsing the Divine and his works and claiming a responsive endorsement of the politician by the divinity. Lincoln's second inaugural address, by one count, had 14 references to God and four quotations from the scriptures. (Senator Joe Lieberman has been criticized for a speech in Nashville, after he was named Al Gore's running mate, in which he mentioned God 13 times. But he still falls short of the Lincoln standard.)</p>
        <p>Approximately 100 years later, President Lyndon Johnson, speaking about the civil rights law of 1965, declared, ''It is rather our duty to do his Divine Will. But I cannot help believing that he truly understands and that he really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight.'' Johnson, like Lincoln, kept the line between church and state reasonably clear, if not the line between religion and politics.</p>
        <p>The significant blending of the latter two took place in Dwight Eisenhower's campaigns and administrations. The first campaign was presented under the banner of a crusade, although its cross was a little vague. One of the crusaders, a member of Congress, charged that the previous administration had tried to ''make a settlement with the devil, communism, instead of spurning him as Christ did when tempted.'' The inaugural parade of 1953 even featured what was called ''God's float,'' a late entry. And the pledge of allegiance to the flag was changed during the administration to include the words, ''under God.'' Finally, the postmaster general issued a stamp bearing the motto, ''In God We Trust,'' and the same slogan was prescribed for United States money, scarcely a vote of confidence in the secretary of the treasury.</p>
        <p>The John Kennedy campaign and administration had a different religious thrust. They were more detached and impersonal. Whereas Ike had included, as part of the inaugural program, a prayer he himself had composed, the Kennedy inaugural was sustained by the prayers of the Catholic Archbishop (later Cardinal) Richard Cushing; Archbishop Iakovos of the Greek Orthodox Church; John Barclay, a Protestant minister; and Rabbi Nelson Glueck. Whereas, as William Miller wrote in his book ''Piety along the Potomac,'' Eisenhower had a vague religion strongly held to, Kennedy had a strong religion vaguely held to.</p>
        <p>The fusion of religion and politics, or of morality and politics, proceeded under President Richard Nixon. He did not go quite as far as to say that the morality of the prince is the morality of the people, but he did say that the president was the moral leader and spokesman of the people.</p>
        <p>President Gerald Ford, when he pardoned Nixon, was more restrained. He said that he was acting as God's humble servant.</p>
        <p>More recently, presidents and presidential candidates have claimed more direct and personal relationships. Many claim to have been ''reborn,'' including Jimmy Carter, John Anderson and, in milder form, Ronald Reagan. Mr. Carter was most outspoken, reporting that he prayed many times a day. Pat Robertson, as a candidate for president, said that he spoke directly to God but that he did not use those communications in his campaign. Mr. Anderson hinted that God was his ultimate campaign manager. (He later enlisted the public relations expert David Garth as a supplement.)</p>
        <p>And in 2000 all manner of candidates have been calling God down for campaign help.</p>
        <p>When Vice President Al Gore called Senator Lieberman to select him as his running mate, we are told the two men shared a prayer. And at the Democratic ticket's debut in Nashville, God was mentioned often.</p>
        <p>During the primary campaign, Gov. George W. Bush was asked his favorite philosopher, thinker or historic figure. He named Jesus. (To his credit, Senator John McCain picked Theodore Roosevelt.)</p>
        <p>Perhaps God does not object to political appropriation. But, in some sense, such tactics mock God. They also muddle politics.</p>
        <p>And scripture warns that God is not to be mocked. Leave God in his heaven (or the human heart, when he is present there). Let the public square be filled with citizens.</p>
        <p>The president is not the moral leader of his people, no matter how often he prays or mentions God's name. He was never intended to be the moral leader, and it is unhealthy when candidates for president present themselves or are regarded in this way, especially when they think they have a pipeline to God.</p>
        <p>The president is the premier political leader -- one hopes with some sense of morality. But moral leadership, in a pluralistic society, is the work of many. It is not invested in one person, or even one system of belief. Moreover, morality, compassion, decency and good manners are not the province merely of religious (or ''deeply religious'') people. There may be more than a few secular humanists out there who are good neighbors and better citizens.</p>
        <p>There may even still be a few Christians, Jews, Buddhists or Moslems who wish to purify their souls, and work out their redemptions, in private. Religious belief, privately held, may well be good for democracy, as John Adams felt. Its politicization is not.</p>
        <p>Religifying politics tempts politicians to messianic delusion. And politicizing religion cheapens and corrupts the spirit. If we return to the wisdom of the founders on this point, excessive public expressions of religious piety will be regarded with suspicion. Our motto should be: ''By their deeds shall we know them.''</p>
