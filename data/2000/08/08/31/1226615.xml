        <p>God may have given people dominion over the animals, but such biblical injunctions mean little for the sleek, toned thoroughbreds that are stabled around the Saratoga racetrack.</p>
        <p>Here horses are supreme. They are waited upon and cared for by hundreds of grooms, hot walkers, exercise riders, veterinarians, night watchmen, assistant trainers, trainers, jockeys and owners. They fetch tens of thousands to millions of dollars at auctions, and the race to the wire not only breaks or makes fortunes, but imparts worth and identity to the lowest of stable hands. All of life, it seems, is viewed through a totemic relationship to a horse.</p>
        <p>''I was given an autographed picture by the exercise rider who handled Secretariat,'' said the Rev. Jim Watson, 51, the Southern Baptist minister who serves as the racetrack chaplain in the summer at Saratoga and each fall at Belmont, ''and this was 20 years after Secretariat won the Triple Crown. But in this world, he is somebody because he once rode Secretariat.''</p>
        <p>There are two enclaves at the racetrack for horse enthusiasts. In the world the public sees, the animals are unleashed at 40 miles an hour in a thundering fury by diminutive jockeys dressed in colorful silk jackets and polished black boots. Presiding over this world are owners who often invest millions of dollars to finance their passion and rarely turn a profit. It is the Saratoga of show,  glitter, excitement and sumptuous excess.</p>
        <p>But the underside of the sport is the backstretch, where 1,200 migrant workers, who tend the stables and the mounts, live crowded into dirty, spartan rooms and usually work seven days a week for a couple of hundred dollars. The backstretch was dominated a few decades ago by African-Americans from the South, but now belongs mostly to Puerto Ricans and Mexicans.</p>
        <p>Those in this world rise as early as 4 a.m. They dart around the highly strung 1,000-pound animals, cleaning out the stalls, filling water buckets, pouring out feed, washing down the animals and walking them to cool down after their daily 20 minutes of exercise. Most work seven days a week. Few receive overtime. Nearly all have been kicked, crushed or knocked over by the horses, with many spending weeks recovering from broken bones.</p>
        <p>''As soon as we go outside the gates we are made to feel we do not belong,'' said Maria Roma, 49, who has worked most of her life as a groom, ''especially in Saratoga. You should see how they look at us, like dogs.</p>
        <p>''But I would not give up this life. I like the movement, the excitement and the people. I was not made to sit at home in a house. I don't like to be tied down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Watson, a portly preacher who speaks English and Spanish in a slow Arkansas drawl, says he is called to minister in the backstretch. He often rises early in the morning to drink coffee along the rail of the practice track, chat and watch the exercise riders, bent low or riding high in the stirrups, as they work the horses.</p>
        <p>He broke horses in Hot Springs, Ark., as a young man, and has a scar running from his left armpit to his hip where he was tossed into a barbed wire fence. He has spent most of his life at tracks, hanging around Oakland Park in Arkansas as a boy, and has worked for 14 years as a chaplain at Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga, hired by Race Track Chaplains of America.</p>
        <p>But while he loves the animals and says he adores the host of misfits and  oddballs that make up the racing scene, he also sees it as destructive  to many who toil in its lower rungs. His weekly service and daily devotionals with the jockeys rarely attract more than a dozen congregants. But he slogs on, hoping to relieve what he says is widespread fatalism and despair.</p>
        <p>''I do not like the emphasis that makes an animal more important than a human being,'' he said. ''It has a tremendous impact on self-esteem. If a horse limps out of a stall, everyone gets excited and upset. If a groom limps, no one cares as long as he can make it around the shed row.''</p>
        <p>The migrant workers move from track to track. They may spend the summer in Saratoga, the fall at Belmont or Aqueduct and the winter in Florida. Most have few possessions, little job security and no roots.</p>
        <p>''Life at the track teaches you to live day by day,'' Mr. Watson said early one morning, as half a dozen horses were pounding down the dirt strip. ''You learn not to count on tomorrow. I would say that 95 percent of those in the backstretch do not know when they will leave Saratoga for New York. If they are lucky the trainer will tell them the night before, if they are not they will learn about it the morning of departure. And many do not even know if they will go from here to Belmont or Kentucky.''</p>
        <p>''You can have the top horse in the country and he can take one misstep out there and suddenly after all that work you have nothing,'' he said. ''The problem with living like this is that it makes people fatalistic. They believe they do not have control. They merely react to what happens. There is a very fine line between learning to live day by day and giving up on life and letting things happen. And this fatalism shows itself in alcohol abuse and drug use.''</p>
        <p>In the dusk one evening this week, after the races had ended and the horses been put into their stalls for the night, Hispanic laborers, some of whom admitted they were in the country illegally, crowded around a pavilion where two women cooked rice, beans, tortillas and hunks of beef. The women dished out the food on thin aluminum plates and stuffed crumbled $5 bills from the workers into their aprons. Those eating the food clutched bottles of Budweiser  with soiled fingers.</p>
        <p>They spoke of children and wives back home and the struggles to wire enough of their earnings to support them. They spat out the names of jockeys, who can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, but bring them only a box of doughnuts the morning after winning huge purses. And they cursed trainers who they said pushed them too hard.</p>
        <p>But when they talked of their ambitions, all stayed within the narrow hierarchy of the track. They said they dreamed of moving from hot walker to groom to exercise rider to trainer, as if this was the only progress in life worth contemplating. All said they loved horses.</p>
        <p>''My father spent 11 years as a groom here,'' said Carlos Sepulvera,  21, a groom from Chile, his long hair cascading out of a baseball cap. ''Now he is an assistant trainer in Chile. I am waiting to go back and train my own horses.''</p>
        <p>But until then, Mr. Sepulvera, who works seven days a week and sleeps on the floor of a room with four other men, survives on $200 a week.</p>
        <p>A hush fell over the stable workers as Mr. Watson began his weekly open-air service. The minister laid out Bibles, adorned with pictures of jockeys riding their mounts in the winner's circle. The covers of the books said, ''A Guidebook for Running the Race of Life.''</p>
        <p>Eight people, including Pat Day, 46, who earned more than a million dollars this year, making him the leading jockey in the country, sat in the chairs for the service. Mr. Day, with other jockeys, had also attended a devotional service with Mr. Watson shortly before the day's race.</p>
        <p>The clang of a bicycle bell announced the arrival of Eduardo Fontanel, 52. He had collected dozens of empty beer bottles and strapped them in plastic bags to his ornately decorated bike, which he said he  bought for $20 three years ago and took with him from track to track. He wore beads in the form of a Puerto Rican flag around his neck.</p>
        <p>''I make $50 a day returning these bottles,'' he said, taking a swig from a beer bottle he had placed in a wire holder on his handlebars. ''Every day I have a huge new crop.''</p>
        <p>When it came time to pray, the worshipers bent their heads. They talked of the sick, the injured and the departed, and then the track.</p>
        <p>''God grant us safety,'' said Bill Rutherford, 39, a night watchman, ''and protect the horses.''</p>
        <p>''There is no protection for us,'' said Tatiana Martinez, 16, a hot walker, who sat a few feet away. ''No woman walks around the backstretch in the dark, not with all the people who get crazy every night from drink.''</p>
