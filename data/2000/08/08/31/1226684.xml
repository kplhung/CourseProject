        <p>Royal Philips Electronics said Gerard Kleisterlee, left, a 25-year veteran of the Amsterdam-based consumer electronics company, will replace the chief executive, Cor Boonstra, when he steps down on April 30. In four years at the helm, Mr. Boonstra streamlined the company and shored up profits by selling lagging divisions. His successor, Mr. Kleisterlee, has held numerous positions within Philips, including running the company's components business in Asia. The departure of the 62-year-old Mr. Boonstra coincides with the resignation of Adri Baan, 57, who will step down  as president and chief executive of Philips Consumer Electronics on March 29.</p>
