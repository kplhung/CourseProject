        <p>Charles Atlas might have been one of America's most famous musclemen, ably taking on bullies who kicked sand in his face at the beach. But this week, a federal judge treated his company like a 97-pound weakling and threw it out of court.</p>
        <p>The company, which markets a body-building course popularized in part through generations of comic book advertisements, had gone to court claiming that a character in a short-lived DC comic was taken from Atlas's famous campaign ''The Insult That Made a Man out of Mac.''</p>

        <p>Charles Atlas might have been one of America's most famous musclemen, ably taking on bullies who kicked sand in his face at the beach. But this week, a federal judge treated his company like a 97-pound weakling and threw it out of court.</p>
        <p>The company, which markets a body-building course popularized in part through generations of comic book advertisements, had gone to court claiming that a character in a short-lived DC comic was taken from Atlas's famous campaign ''The Insult That Made a Man out of Mac.''</p>
        <p>The ad told the brief story of Mac, the 97-pound weakling, and a bully who kicks sand in his face. Mac, humiliated by the sand kicking, takes the Charles Atlas course, becomes a hulking giant and returns to thrash the bully. In the final panel, the words ''Hero of the Beach'' hover over Mac's head, while his girlfriend looks on.</p>
        <p>In 1991, DC Comics published a book featuring a character called Flex Mentallo. The comic book featured a vignette titled ''Musclebound -- The Secret Origin of Flex Mentallo.'' Like Mac, Flex started out as a weakling, was humiliated by a bully and gained super strength through exercise. But after beating the bully, Flex turns on his girlfriend and beats her, proclaiming, ''I don't need a tramp like you anymore.''</p>
        <p>Charles Atlas Ltd. claimed the Flex Mentallo character owed its origin to the Mac advertising campaign, and that DC's portrayal had damaged the good will gained by the original ad.</p>
        <p>But Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, of Federal District Court in Manhattan, rejected Atlas's argument. She granted DC's motion for a summary judgment and dismissed the case on Tuesday. Judge Buchwald ruled that Charles Atlas had failed to raise the issue within the six-year statute of limitations required by such cases, and she also found that the DC comic was a parody of the Charles Atlas ads, and therefore not subject to a lawsuit for trademark infringement.</p>
        <p>Lillian Laserson, vice president and general counsel for DC Comics, welcomed the decision, saying the episode was meant as a parody. ''We meant no harm to the Charles Atlas company, nor do I think we caused any harm,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But the lawyer for Charles Atlas said DC Comics should not have copied the ad campaign.</p>
        <p>''It is our position, whether or not he had turned around and beat up his own girlfriend after he became an Atlas man, it would have been an infringement,'' said Seth Akabas, a lawyer whose firm represented Charles Atlas Ltd.</p>
        <p>The company survives the body builder Charles Atlas, who died in 1972. He was often featured in the ads in his bathing suit.</p>
