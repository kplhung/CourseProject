        <p>Damir Dokic, the father and coach of the rising Australian star Jelena Dokic, was barred from the United States Open yesterday after a series of confrontations at Arthur Ashe Stadium.</p>
        <p>Dokic, who has been cited for unruly behavior at other tournaments, unraveled yesterday during a 20-minute scene that began with his outrage over the price of salmon in the players' cafeteria. The situation  then escalated in a parking lot adjacent to Arthur Ashe Stadium.</p>
        <p>At Wimbledon in June, Dokic was escorted off the grounds by a police officer after belligerent behavior, but was allowed to return. However, the United States Tennis Association banned him from the Open grounds yesterday after he cursed at a cook in the players' cafeteria, hurled his plastic credential at a WTA official, shoved another Tour official and then physically resisted the head of security's attempts to remove him from the grounds.</p>
        <p>After resisting once, Dokic agreed on the second attempt to get into a courtesy car. Jelena sat in the back seat, stunned and tearful, ready to return to their Manhattan hotel.</p>
        <p>Jelena, 17 years old, ranked 43rd in the world and a Wimbledon semifinalist, will play her second-round singles match today against Miriam Oremans. She and her father emigrated to Australia in 1994 from Serbia, and he has been his daughter's only full-time coach.</p>
        <p>''Based on Mr. Dokic's past history of such incidents, a formal review is being conducted to determine what action will be taken by the Tour,'' Bart McGuire, chief executive officer of the WTA Tour, said in a statement. ''The Tour will announce its decision shortly after the U.S. Open.''</p>
        <p>After Jelena had won a doubles match yesterday, the incident began in the players' cafeteria over the $12.50 price of the main entree, salmon. The line cook, Mattie Jones, 32, has been working at the Open since 1988. She said she had already endured the father's oral abuse on Monday and Tuesday. ''He's so nasty I don't even like to serve him,'' said Jones, who added about yesterday,  ''I could tell he was going to explode, and I was looking for my manager.''</p>
        <p>When Jones served him the salmon, he was not pleased with the price or the portion.</p>
        <p>Jones said he started cursing and ''calling me a cow.'' She added, ''He was just really going off.''</p>
        <p>Jones called her manager, who alerted Pete Pistone, who has been director of security for the Open for the last 21 years. As Pistone tried to remove Dokic from the second-floor cafeteria, Dokic threw his credential at Jim Fuhse, the Tour's director of player promotions and special projects. Then he lightly shoved Barbara Perry, the Tour's director.</p>
        <p>Pistone gripped him tightly on the shoulders as he walked out to the parking lot. Dokic, an imposing man, screamed obscenities at Pistone in particular and at the United States in general. He said Pistone was fighting him and threw up his arms. Jelena  stood sullen on the side, still dressed in her tennis clothes.</p>
        <p>Jelena, usually stoic in the face of her father's actions, began to cry. Father and daughter stood on the double yellow line in the middle of the service street in front of the stadium, Dokic hugging Jelena and wiping her tears.</p>
        <p>When reached in his hotel two hours after the incident, Dokic made rambling remarks that included references to Russian President Vladimir V. Putin and further epithets about America. Asked whether he planned to return to the National Tennis Center today, Dokic responded clearly: ''Of course,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, U.S.T.A. officials confiscated Dokic's credential. He cannot enter the grounds and he will also not be allowed to buy a ticket. His picture was circulated last night on the U.S.T.A. grounds to all security personnel and ticket officers.</p>
        <p>If the WTA were to impose a lifetime ban on Dokic, he would join Jim Pierce, Mary Pierce's father, as the other parent-coach to be banned by the Tour.</p>
        <p>At Wimbledon this year, the police escorted Dokic off the grounds after he had made disruptive comments while holding the St. George's flag of England and after he smashed a journalist's telephone. Even though he was allowed back on the grounds, the WTA said then that another incident would cause him to be banned from a tournament.</p>
        <p>In 1999, Dokic was ejected from a Birmingham, England, tournament for shouting at spectators. Later, he was picked up by the police after he was found lying in front of traffic. Cautioned for drunkeness and disorderly behavior, he was released without being charged.</p>
        <p>In reference to past incidents, Jelena has reportedly said that she ''is comfortable'' with her father. She has not yet told WTA officials to take action against him. Because of that, they had been unwilling to place sanctions against him, at least until yesterday.</p>
        <p>TENNIS: U.S. OPEN  Correction:  September 2, 2000, Saturday  Because of an editing error, a sports article on Thursday about Damir Dokic, father and coach of the Australian tennis player Jelena Dokic, misstated the given name of a women's tour official he shoved before being banned from the United States Open grounds. She is Brenda Perry, not Barbara.</p>
