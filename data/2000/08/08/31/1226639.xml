        <p>The company that sells natural gas to people across much of northern Illinois plans to inspect as many as 200,000 suburban Chicago homes for traces of mercury, having discovered it in 44 during a preliminary investigation.</p>
        <p>The company, Nicor Gas of nearby Naperville, Ill., will inspect houses where workers may have spilled liquid mercury while removing natural-gas meters that were being updated in a project that has been under way in the northwest suburbs for a decade. Before 1961, in a practice that was once common, two teaspoons of elemental mercury, or quicksilver, was placed in Nicor meters to regulate the flow of natural gas.</p>
        <p>In its liquid form, elemental mercury, the type in the meters, is not nearly so dangerous as organic mercury, or methylmercury, which can cause extreme levels of toxicity in lakes and fish. As a liquid, elemental mercury is slow to be absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream.</p>
        <p>As a vapor, however, elemental mercury rapidly enters the bloodstream once breathed in. It can then cause disorders ranging from hand tremors and appetite loss to vast brain and kidney damage.</p>
        <p>A Chicago spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency said the number of residences to be inspected by Nicor apparently made this the largest single search for toxicity in the home that a company had ever  undertaken. The spokeswoman, Phillippa Cannon, said that she had been speaking to colleagues at the agency's headquarters in Washington and that no one there ''is aware of anything this big.''</p>
        <p>The mercury scare began on July 20, when a Nicor customer reported the presence of a silvery substance in his basement. Since then, the company has been testing for mercury in hundreds of houses, and in some cases finding it. As of this morning, inspectors had been to 358 homes, with 44 testing positive and 314 negative.</p>
        <p>Nicor at first attributed the leaks to the faulty work of an outside contractor that the company had hired to work on the meter-updating project. But then a crew detected mercury in a home where Nicor employees themselves had removed the meter. As a result, the number of suspect homes leaped overnight, to 200,000 from 200.</p>
        <p>Inspecting that many homes will take six months, Nicor said, although a company spokesman,  Lee Haines, could not estimate  the cost of the inspections and cleanups combined. Varying conditions in the home, Mr. Haines said, will cause costs of a cleanup to differ from house to house.</p>
        <p>Daphne Magnuson, a spokeswoman for the American Gas Association, said it appeared that most gas utilities had already replaced their mercury-containing meters, in updating programs that began in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Ms. Magnuson noted that those programs had nothing to do with any concern about the mercury. The old meters were replaced, she said, in favor of new technology that made the readings more precise.</p>
