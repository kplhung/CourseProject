        <p>Whirlpool, the nation's largest maker of home appliances, warned today that its profit would be sharply lower than expected in the second half of the year, partly because of Circuit City's decision to stop selling major appliances at its retail outlets.</p>

        <p>Whirlpool, the nation's largest maker of home appliances, warned today that its profit would be sharply lower than expected in the second half of the year, partly because of Circuit City's decision to stop selling major appliances at its retail outlets.</p>
        <p>Whirlpool also blamed an industrywide slowdown and fierce price competition that is cutting into profit margins. A large part of the downturn in the home appliance market is being attributed to slumping retail sales and a weakening housing market in the United States, where higher interest rates have cooled consumer buying.</p>
        <p>Whirlpool reduced its profit estimates by as much as 37 percent for the third quarter and 25 percent for the second half. A week ago, Wall Street was projecting profits of $7 a diluted share this year, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Today, analysts are expecting profits of about $5.58 a share.</p>
        <p>The analysts said that five weeks ago, when Circuit City made its announcement, Whirlpool played down the news, so few on Wall Street expected such a sharp cut in the earnings forecasts.</p>
        <p>''They caught everybody by surprise today,'' said Justin Maurer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''I took my number down to $6.25, but obviously it wasn't enough.''</p>
        <p>Whirlpool closed unchanged, at $37.88, in heavy trading on the Big Board, though at one point in today's session it had been off as much as $6.61. But the stock has been hammered in recent weeks and is near an eight-year low on concern that the company's prospects are declining.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Whirlpool announcement was just the latest blow to an industry that has been jolted by a weakening housing market and changes in the retailing market that have Circuit City quitting the business and Wal-Mart Stores selling major appliances in a low-cost format. The stock of Maytag has plummeted more than 40 percent the last year because of two profit warnings partly caused by a slowdown in the sale of its lower-priced models. With the industry under pressure, Electrolux, the giant Swedish appliance maker, has recently been talking with Maytag about a possible merger.</p>
        <p>The industry has also been shaken  by changes in the retail market and developments with the Internet. GE Appliances, a unit of General Electric, has made deals with Home Depot and Wal-Mart to ship its inventory directly to homes. The customers, though, would order at a retailer's kiosk or Web site.</p>
        <p>General Electric is creating a system that would allow it to sell through big retailers but handle all the inventory and shipping to the customer itself. This week, Lloyd D. Ward, the chief executive at Maytag, said it was also considering distributing its products through G.E.</p>
        <p>''The traditional model has changed overnight,'' said Terry Dunn, a spokesman at GE Appliances. ''A retailer doesn't need trucks, systems and warehouses to be in the appliance business.''</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts say distribution is a major factor in the pessimism surrounding Whirlpool's stock. Some of that pessimism was aroused on Monday, after Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at Prudential Securities, issued a bearish forecast on Whirlpool's prospect with a rare ''sell'' rating on the stock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heymann said that Whirlpool's profit outlook was dim over the next few years and that the stock could fall to as low as $25 a share because companies like G.E. were changing the industry's dynamics.</p>
        <p>In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, however, Whirlpool officials denounced Mr. Heymann's report as misguided and ''lacking credibility.'' They said the company's own studies had found that consumers were not changing their buying habits and still wanted what would, in effect, be full-service offerings from retailers.</p>
        <p>''This is pure speculation about where business will be done,'' said David R. Whitwam, chief executive at Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Mich. ''And if people want to buy in different formats in the future, we'll be there.''</p>
        <p>Whirlpool also said that its own retail distribution setup had ''similar capabilities'' and was ''competitive'' with that of G.E.</p>
        <p>Company officials also told analysts that the market's valuing of Whirlpool was ''illogical,'' particularly because the company expects business to recover in the fourth quarter with profits expected to grow about 15 percent in 2001.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Whirlpool plans to step up a stock buyback that until recently had repurchased millions of shares at an average of $55 a share.</p>
        <p>Company officials also said the industry's price war was ''irrational'' and could have a longer-term impact but that Circuit City's decision to leave the business would only have a short-term effect. Circuit City did about 5 percent of the nation's retail appliance business, Whirlpool said.</p>
        <p>Whirlpool said its own studies suggested that customers would move to Sears, Best Buy, Lowe's and other outlets, where Whirlpool was a dominant player with its brands that include Whirlpool, Roper and KitchenAid. And company executives say they would not compete simply on price.</p>
        <p>''We have products no one can match,'' Mr. Whitwam said. ''Price is not the first purchase criteria for most of our customers.''</p>
