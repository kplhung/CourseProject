        <p>Two Manhattan greengrocers have agreed to pay nearly $100,000 in back wages to immigrant workers who sometimes received only $200 for working 72-hour weeks, state officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>One of the workers, Candido Aparicio, an immigrant from Mexico, said that he worked like an animal, lifting heavy loads during 12-hour days for which he did not receive time-and-a-half overtime pay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aparicio spoke at a news conference yesterday at the Manhattan office of Eliot L. Spitzer, the state attorney general, who investigated the two stores, Lucky Farms, at Broadway and 105th Street, and the 118 First Avenue Food and Vegetable Corporation, which is at First Avenue and Seventh Street.</p>
        <p>The attorney general's office said many workers at the grocers were paid $180 to $360 for 72-hour weeks, which translates to $2.60 to $3.60 an hour. The minimum wage is $5.15 an hour. ''As a society, we should be far beyond the point where individuals are required to work long, arduous hours for less than the minimum wage,'' Mr. Spitzer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer announced that Lucky Farm agreed to pay $62,500 in back wages to six workers and that 118 First Avenue had agreed to pay $29,608 in back wages and damages to four workers.</p>
        <p>He said his office pursued the two grocers as part of an effort to stop minimum wage violations involving immigrant workers and to pressure all of New York City's 2,000 greengrocers to comply with state and federal labor laws. Most of the more than 10,000 employees at these stores are Mexicans, and many of them are illegal immigrants.</p>
        <p>Labor experts say there is widespread flouting of minimum wage laws at such stores and occasional illegal use of child labor.</p>
        <p>The attorney general's office also announced yesterday that it had undertaken an education program that is intended to encourage grocery stores across the city and state to comply with wage and hour laws. His office is working on this education campaign with the United States Department of Labor and the Korean Produce Association, which advises greengrocers and provides them with a distribution network.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer called the long hours and low wages ''egregiously wrong, especially in this time of economic prosperity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aparicio, who worked at Lucky Farms, said that for years he was paid just $200 after 72 hours or more each week. But he said his employer started paying him $400 a week, after deductions, as soon as Mr. Spitzer's office began investigating last year.</p>
        <p>''We were mistreated constantly,'' Mr. Aparicio said in an interview. ''We were cursed by the employer. If we got sick, we didn't get paid.''</p>
        <p>Andrew Hoffmann, a lawyer for Lucky Farm, said his client had amicably settled the matter. ''Unfortunately, there is widespread ignorance of some of the technical aspects of the wage and hour laws,'' he said, ''particularly among some of the immigrant communities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffmann said many store owners were ''ethical, hardworking people who work very long hours in a very marginal business.''</p>
        <p>A man who answered the telephone at 118 First Avenue said the owner was not available for comment. The store's lawyer, Lloyd Somer, was unavailable because he was away on vacation, a law firm receptionist said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer's office said it was tipped off to the violations by Local 169 of the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees.</p>
