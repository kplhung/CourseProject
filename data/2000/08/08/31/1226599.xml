        <p>Federal regulators trying to determine how much the Ford Motor Company knew about defective tires used on its Explorers expanded their investigation today by demanding that the company provide detailed information on any tire problems in 16 countries outside the United States.</p>
        <p>The disclosure was made public by regulators in a letter sent on Tuesday to Ford from officials at the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. Both the agency and the automaker have come under increasing political pressure, particularly as it has become clear that for nearly two years Ford received complaints from overseas about possible problems with Firestone tires on its Explorers but did not recall them until this month. United States regulators say that they have received more than 750 complaints about the tires involving at least 62 deaths. Almost all of the deaths occurred in sport utility vehicles, mostly Explorers, that rolled over.</p>

        <p>Federal regulators trying to determine how much the Ford Motor Company knew about defective tires used on its Explorers expanded their investigation today by demanding that the company provide detailed information on any tire problems in 16 countries outside the United States.</p>
        <p>The disclosure was made public by regulators in a letter sent on Tuesday to Ford from officials at the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. Both the agency and the automaker have come under increasing political pressure, particularly as it has become clear that for nearly two years Ford received complaints from overseas about possible problems with Firestone tires on its Explorers but did not recall them until this month. United States regulators say that they have received more than 750 complaints about the tires involving at least 62 deaths. Almost all of the deaths occurred in sport utility vehicles, mostly Explorers, that rolled over.</p>
        <p>The letter was a clear attempt by the regulators to determine who knew what, and when. Ford executives have said that they investigated complaints in Venezuela and in Saudi Arabia about tire problems and challenged the conclusions of Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., the American unit of Bridgestone of Japan, that the tires were not defective. But Ford executives have also said that they did not understand the true magnitude of the problems until earlier this month after discussions with Firestone and that they then acted quickly to begin the process of replacing 6.5 million tires.</p>
        <p>Federal officials say they have limited ability to monitor recalls and defects of cars sold abroad, although some critics like Joan Claybrook, a former top official at the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, say the agency has the authority under a 1966 law to monitor recalls and defects abroad but refuses to exercise it.</p>
        <p>Congress is exploring whether to expand the authority of the regulators and impose new rules on automakers to report problems discovered outside the United States. This week, Ford and Firestone described a series of disagreements about the tires after complaints in 1998 in Venezuela and last year in Saudi Arabia. Ford had concluded the tires were defective, while Firestone insisted they were not.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, a government agency in Venezuela is expected to issue a report criticizing both Ford and Firestone for the way that they handled tire problems there. Ford had recalled vehicles with the tires in Venezuela in May and had earlier replaced tires on 160 Explorers in Thailand in March and April.</p>
        <p>The two companies and American regulators are expected to face intensive questioning next week when Congressional hearings begin over the tire recall. The companies are obliged to report defects in the United States to regulators, but regulators have said the companies do not face reporting obligations in many circumstances when the problems are noticed in cars abroad.</p>
        <p>''Manufacturers have certain legal obligations to report defect problems and N.H.T.S.A. has some obligations to Congress,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who heads one of the House committees investigating the tire recall. ''Someone dropped the ball, and we're trying to find out who. But we're really trying to figure out some broader issues. Did Firestone break the law or is the law broken? We're going to have to take a hard look at the law to make sure it's strong enough.''</p>
        <p>Those scheduled to testify next week at the proceedings before two House committees include Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, other transportation regulators, executives from the two companies and safety experts. Congressional aides say they may also take testimony from owners of Explorers involved in traffic accidents that they think were caused by defective tires.</p>
        <p>There were further negotiations today between lawmakers and Ford over the possible appearance at the hearings of Jacques A. Nasser, the  chief executive of Ford, who has refused to testify. The company announced today that it would send Helen Petrauskas, vice president for environmental and safety engineering, and Tom Baughman, an engineering director, to testify. By contrast, Bridgestone/Firestone agreed to send Masatoshi Ono, its chief executive, to the hearing.</p>
        <p>In the Senate, the Commerce Committee said today that it would postpone the beginning of its hearings by  a week until mid-September. Congressional aides said the hearings were delayed to give the committee's chairman, Senator John McCain, more time to recuperate from recent surgery for skin cancer.</p>
        <p>Congressional officials said that the Senate hearing could be broader than the House proceeding and that it might also examine a court decision on Tuesday that said Ford had knowingly installed defective ignition mechanisms in nearly two million vehicles produced from 1983 to 1995. Ford has disputed those findings.</p>
        <p>Officials at the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration declined to comment about the judge's decision today. Nearly two years ago, the agency concluded that Ford had not been forthcoming about ignition problems but decided to take no action against the company. In a letter sent at the time to Ford and a plaintiff's lawyer who had raised complaints that the company was deceptive, the transportation agency's chief counsel decided not to penalize Ford because the company's failure to be forthcoming had occurred in the 1980's and the potential penalties would amount only to a maximum of $7,000.</p>
        <p>The stocks of both Ford and Bridgestone have slumped since the tire recall was announced. Shares of Ford have fallen 12 percent, to $26, while the American depository receipts of Bridgestone have fallen 22 percent, to $144.50. In Japan, shares of Bridgestone have declined 34.6 percent.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 9, 2000, Saturday  An article in Business Day on Aug. 31 about a regulatory agency investigation of defective Firestone tires misstated the name of the agency. The error also occurred in an editorial on Thursday and an Op-Ed article yesterday. The agency is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, not the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.</p>
