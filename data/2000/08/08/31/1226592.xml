        <p>Packers quarterback Brett Favre said today that, although he is not 100 percent, the tendinitis in his throwing elbow will not prevent him from starting against the Jets in the season opener Sunday in Green Bay.</p>
        <p>Favre missed the last three exhibition games after playing in just two series against the Jets in the Packers' first preseason game on Aug. 4. Favre took almost two full weeks off from any type of throwing before resuming practice late last week.</p>
        <p>''I haven't tried to throw 40- or 50-yarders, but I don't see much need,'' Favre said during a telephone conference call. ''I've been able to throw medium distance stuff with no pain.''</p>
        <p>Favre has begun to throw with more velocity, but said he is still worried about ''zinging'' a pass. He began practicing last Thursday, throwing about 15 short passes. On Monday, he threw 50 balls. After taking Tuesday off, Favre threw about 30 passes this morning. Favre said he had no pain in his elbow and had only tightness in his forearm. He said he was not concerned that the tendinitis could become a chronic problem, the way a badly sprained thumb sustained early in the 1999 preseason hindered him throughout last season; he had his lowest quarterback rating, 74.7, since 1993.</p>
        <p>''When I started training camp, it was fine,'' Favre said. ''The first week it felt great. I played well in the scrimmage. It was after that scrimmage where it started to ache. Every year I usually get blisters on the tips of my fingers. This year it was worse than I ever had them. With every throw, blood was coming out of them.''</p>
        <p>Favre suggested that the blisters may have made him adjust his passing motion, contributing to the tendinitis. ''I think it was me changing the delivery of my throws to help with the blisters and then putting more pressure on my elbow,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I should probably say I'm more concerned, but I'm not,'' Favre said. ''I'm going to play in this game and I expect to play well.''</p>
