        <p>School vouchers make a big difference for black students.</p>
        <p>That is the conclusion of a two-year study in three cities -- New York, Washington and Dayton, Ohio -- conducted by a team from Harvard, the University of Wisconsin and the Brookings Institution. These are not hotbeds of right-wing ideology.</p>
        <p>The improved test performance of African-American students who were able to take advantage of vouchers suggests a stunning reversal of their fortunes. If the trend line continues, the report says, ''the black-white test gap could be eliminated in subsequent years of education for black students who use a voucher to switch from public to private school.''</p>
        <p>Thus do vouchers change lives. In this randomized field trial -- a rigorous technique used in medical research, rarely in education surveys -- a fair comparison could be made with a reduction of class size among black students in Tennessee. ''The effects of vouchers after two years,'' the report observes, ''are over twice as large.''</p>
        <p>This hard evidence is not what teacher unionists want to hear. ''It's the first controlled experiment in the school-choice area,'' says Chester Finn, the Moynihan disciple who heads one of the dozen foundations that commissioned it. ''This gives us the highest-quality study we've ever had, and the result in three areas is unequivocal: School vouchers dramatically raise test scores for blacks.''</p>
        <p>We can expect some academics to disparage the private funders and thereby to suggest that the eminent academic researchers sold out. But other educators, even those concerned about directing public funds to the 10 percent of schools that are private, will pay attention to evidence that conflicts with their assumptions.</p>
        <p>Why is it that only blacks, and no other racial or socioeconomic group,  improved their scores using vouchers? I put that question to the lead investigator, Paul E. Peterson, who is director of Harvard's Program on Education Policy and Governance.</p>
        <p>''That puzzled us, too,'' said Professor Peterson. ''African-American parents in New York City pointed to less fighting and race conflict in the private schools, the expectation of more homework, and better communication between parent and teacher. Public schools that serve mainly black students are more different from private schools,'' he concluded, ''than are the public schools that serve mainly white or Hispanic-American students.''</p>
        <p>I take that to mean that the teaching, facilities and atmosphere in schools where blacks predominate is often so bad that the students given the chance to escape that environment ultimately show the most improvement. That kicks in the head theories of racial inferiority and offers hope to kids now in poor schools.</p>
        <p>So what's to be done about encouraging private competition to the near-monopoly now held by government? How do we give parents in urban ghettos a choice?</p>
        <p>Al Gore told cheering teacher-delegates, ''I will never support private school vouchers, which would drain public money away from public education.'' Litmus-testily, he indicated that his Supreme Court choices would vote against vouchers' constitutionality, which the present court has declined to do.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush holds an opposing view. He wants local communities to set standards and hold schools accountable for meeting them. If after three years the schools fail, then the federal contribution should go to parents to spend at competing private schools. He pointedly agrees with Joe Lieberman's pre-convention support of vouchers. And to counter Gore's  warning about ''draining,'' Bush vows to increase federal spending on schools.</p>
        <p>Here is an issue with battle lines drawn -- but where's the battle? The front lines are in California and Michigan, where voucher propositions are on the ballot, but when I tried to get a straight answer on the hot votes, both camps befogged me with ''he generally does not take positions on state ballot matters.''</p>
        <p>The Harvard study shows Bush is on the right side of this. He should embrace the successful voucher students and joyfully join the controversy in states where children's futures are now at stake.</p>
