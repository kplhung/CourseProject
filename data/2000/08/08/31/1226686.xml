        <p>AltaVista said that Andrew Mitchell, its British managing director, had resigned. The news follows the company's botched plans to provide flat-fee Internet access service to British customers. AltaVista trumped competitors by being first to announce that it would provide cut-rate Internet access for a single low-cost payment, but then failed to deliver the service. Unlike the free and fixed-rate services in the United States, those in Britain charge by the minute. AltaVista had planned to take advantage of new rules aimed at loosening the grip of British Telecommunications P.L.C. on the local phone market. ''The mistakes in our planned Internet access service, which we do acknowledge, probably made Andy's departure inevitable,'' said Pierre Paperon, president of AltaVista Europe.</p>
