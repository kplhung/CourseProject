        <p>MANY of her clients are surprised when Kellie Carlisle, a high-tech investigator in Orlando, Fla., tells them that she really doesn't need to have physical custody of a suspected computer to reach inside the labyrinth of chips and wires for the information she needs.</p>
        <p>''I am a good-guy hacker,'' said Ms. Carlisle, who legally breaks into password-protected computer systems for private detectives, banks and large corporations. Often within minutes, she lays out records of illegal drug transactions, infidelity, fraud or pornography. What she finds often shocks even her most educated clients.</p>
        <p>In less than a year, Ms. Carlisle, a former computer consultant for Bell Laboratories, has built her company, Advanced Computer  Investigations, into a multimillion-dollar business that employs 72 contract workers. For that, she credits her love of ferreting out information from what she calls the ''gutless warriors'' who commit crimes from their living rooms.</p>
        <p>What particularly worries her is what she says are the hundreds of teenagers being lured from their homes by smooth-talking sexual predators over the Internet. ''There's a lot of creeps out there,'' Ms. Carlisle said. ''They know just what to say to seduce somebody.''</p>
        <p>What pushed her to become a computer detective was a crime in which she was the victim. One evening last August, while walking across a golf course to her home in  Celebration, Fla., near Orlando, she was assaulted and raped by a man she worked with.</p>
        <p>After she pressed charges, Ms. Carlisle urged police investigators to retrieve the man's personal computer, which she believed would contain a trail of evidence, including e-mail messages, that would help convict her assailant. They told her that it couldn't be done.</p>
        <p>So she set out to prove that it could be done and began working with a private detective, Robert Brown, whom she describes as her friend and mentor. Her case is still being investigated.</p>
        <p>Among Ms. Carlisle's clients are a family trying to find a runaway child, a wife trying to prove that her husband is having an affair and a bank that suspects a customer of laundering money. Many of her corporate clients hire her to track the doings of disgruntled employees, like the unhappy worker at an Internet service provider who used the company's database to send out disparaging e-mail messages about the company.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carlisle is part of a fast-growing network of private and public investigators who specialize in computer crime. James Murray, who is president of the High Technology Crimes Investigation Association, said the organization had grown by 700 members, to 2,300, in the last year.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, there is increased use of computers and access to the Internet,'' Mr. Murray said, ''and with that is the opportunity for people who choose to commit crimes using a computer. We really need to train a lot more people.''</p>
        <p>Business and investigators say services like Ms. Carlisle's are needed more than ever. ''We found we needed people like Kellie to retrieve information,'' Mr. Brown said. ''It's almost a necessity because in this day of cyberspace sex and so forth, it is something we can't get along without.''</p>
        <p>The easiest part of Ms. Carlisle's job is cracking passwords. ''The two most common passwords are 'God' and 'sex,'' she said. With special software, she can usually figure out a password in minutes.</p>
        <p>As a high-tech crime investigator, she uses a number of tools to get the information she needs. Her husband, Michael, a computer consultant, has developed proprietary software, and she is a fan of Norton Internet Security 2000.</p>
        <p>To catch someone's errant husband, for example, Ms. Carlisle can monitor the man's computer use with a ''sniffer,'' software that captures picture images on the computer screen every few seconds and routes them to one of her investigators.</p>
        <p>''We can 'sanitize' a computer to catch and prevent unauthorized intrusion and corruption of files such as bank accounts, e-mails and pictures,'' Ms. Carlisle said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carlisle keeps her legal bases covered. She received a signed statement from the wife in the adultery case, for example, that gave her access to information because the woman and her husband owned the computer jointly.</p>
        <p>She also enlists the help of Internet service providers, who are more than willing to cooperate with releasing e-mail addresses after she tells them that they may be prosecuted for protecting a suspect. She emphasizes to her clients that they must be willing to prosecute offenders after her staff uses computer forensics techniques to extract  encrypted, damaged or even deleted data.</p>
        <p>''I am hoping to get more into homicides,'' Ms. Carlisle said. ''That's where my interest really lies. Everyone confesses their crime, and people tend to confess a lot on their computer. They have to get it off their chest.''</p>
