        <p>Elbow pain continues to prevent Chuck Knoblauch from participating in a minor league rehabilitation assignment, and Joe Torre seems resigned to the possibility that Knoblauch will not be able to play second base again this season.</p>
        <p>''He'll do his work and it bothers him to the point where he's not comfortable doing anything,'' Torre said. ''For me to start counting on him, I don't think is healthy. I hope it turns into a surprise, but I'd hate to look forward to having him and be disappointed in that regard.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch injured his arm making a short throw to second against Baltimore July 24, and little more than a week later, he was placed on the disabled list. The Yankees are hoping that Knoblauch will join Class AAA Columbus for a few games before the Clippers end their season Sept. 3, but it's possible that won't happen. If he can't play second base, he might serve as a part-time designated hitter, pinch-runner and pinch-hitter for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>The injury that has forced Knoblauch to the disabled list for the first time is not dramatic, like a broken bone. Torre does not believe that it's fair to question whether Knoblauch should play in the pain he feels. ''It's tough to do that because you're not in that body,'' he said.</p>
