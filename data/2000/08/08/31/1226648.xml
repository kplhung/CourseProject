        <p>One week after the collapse of a four-way trade that would have sent Patrick Ewing to Seattle, the Knicks have renewed efforts to trade the future Hall of Fame center.</p>
        <p>In what appears to be more evidence of a nearly irreconcilable chasm between Ewing and New York, the Knicks have discussed sending Ewing to the Washington Wizards for Juwan Howard, two Eastern Conference officials said.</p>
        <p>No deal is imminent, but according to National Basketball Association officials, Washington would jump at making the move. If the Wizards received Ewing, who has one year and $14 million remaining on his contract, they could potentially be $10 million beneath the salary cap next summer and vie for a top-flight free agent such as Michael Finley, Dikembe Mutombo or Chris Webber. Why the Knicks would make such a trade is less clear and the discussions appear to be driven by Ewing's agent, David Falk. Ewing was deeply hurt by the reaction of the news media and the fans when the deal last week collapsed.</p>
        <p>Howard is coming off the worst season of his six-year career. On a team that underachieved from start to finish, Howard averaged 14.9 points and 5.7 rebounds and, on several occasions, was booed lustily by his home fans. If Howard, a 6-foot-9-inch forward who is not particularly powerful or graceful, could return to the form that saw him average 19.3 points and 7.9 rebounds over his first five seasons, he could be productive.</p>
        <p>The Knicks and the Wizards have spoken about a deal for Ewing several times over the past year, including two weeks ago before the Knicks put together the foiled four-team, 13-player trade that would have sent Ewing to the Seattle SuperSonics.</p>
        <p>During those discussions, the Wizards' president, Michael Jordan, rebuffed a Knicks offer that included Larry Johnson and Chris Dudley because he felt the Knicks were trying to dump multiple big-money, long-term contracts onto his team. After the trade collapsed, the Knicks rekindled talks on a more realistic and less ambitious scale.</p>
        <p>But the Knicks would still have only Marcus Camby and Chris Dudley at the center position. And they would be an even weaker rebounding team than they were last season, when they finished 24th over all in rebounding and dead last on the offensive end. Giving up Ewing for Howard certainly would not make the Knicks a threat to the new-look Miami Heat, which acquired Brian Grant from Portland yesterday in a three-team deal that sent Shawn Kemp from Cleveland to Portland and Chris Gatling, Clarence Weatherspoon and Gary Grant from Portland to Cleveland.</p>
        <p>There has been speculation that a Ewing-for-Howard trade would lead to a second move, in which the Knicks would send Camby and Allan Houston to the Atlanta Hawks for the All-Star center, Dikembe Mutombo. But an official with the Hawks and an official with the Knicks said yesterday that no such deal was discussed.</p>
        <p>Knicks General Manager Scott Layden could not be reached for comment, but Layden said last week that the Knicks, working in concert with Ewing and his agent, would continue to explore trade opportunities that benefited both sides.</p>
        <p>But few deals that would meet that criteria seem to be possible. The Phoenix Suns, whom Ewing would approve a trade to, are not willing to dismantle their promising young nucleus for the 38-year-old Ewing, and few other teams are willing to give up top talent to take on his salary.</p>
        <p>While a deal with Washington might be the Knicks' only realistic chance for a trade, even it does not fit the description given by Layden. If Ewing is sincere in his quest for a championship, he will not want to spend a season in Washington, where the Wizards have no chance of winning the East. And it is doubtful that the Wizards would re-sign Ewing for two more years after next season.</p>
        <p>The talks between the Knicks and the Wizards seem to be a clear indication of the enormous disgust that Ewing has developed for the Knicks and New York City.</p>
        <p>Even before his public censure last week, Ewing's acceptance of a trade to Seattle, where neither a contract extension nor a finals appearance was likely, pointed to his simply wanting to leave New York.</p>
        <p>While playing in Washington will not pit Ewing, who lives in nearby Potomac, Md., during the off-season, against Indiana or Miami in the second round of the playoffs, it would allow him to close out his career in the city of his collegiate glory (Georgetown) alongside a close friend (Jordan).</p>
        <p>These talks may be a sign that Ewing has told the Knicks to trade him or else, that he no longer wants to be the third offensive wheel on a team he once ruled, that he can no longer handle almost always being considered the reason the Knicks lose and seldom the reason they win.</p>
