        <p>The white politicians ventured into this dusty black township, determined to connect.</p>
        <p>Helen Zille practiced the clicking sounds of the local Xhosa language, her tongue dancing. Dene Smuts hailed the black crowds as ''sisters and brothers.''</p>
        <p>''They're reaching out,'' said Phillip Grobler, a spokesman for the opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, as his caravan of politicians rolled through these shantytowns near Cape Town to a rally in early August. ''The race question always comes back, but we're trying to cross those lines.''</p>
        <p>Promising to transcend racially polarized politics, handshake by handshake and township by township, South Africa's biggest opposition party has kicked off a national campaign to woo the black majority and to dent the overwhelming popularity and power of the governing African National Congress.</p>
        <p>It is clearly an uphill battle. Six years after apartheid ended, no political party has managed to match the A.N.C.'s appeal or to bridge this country's racial divide. But as the nation readies for local elections in November, the predominantly white Democratic Alliance is emboldened by startling fractures within the governing party's black base of support.</p>
        <p>Polls suggest that a growing percentage of blacks are willing to consider alternatives to the Congress as they focus less on the politics of liberation and more on basic governance and the high rates of unemployment and crime.</p>
        <p>Factional fighting and corruption within the party have led increasing numbers of blacks to view the A.N.C. as ''uncaring for the masses and mainly interested in personal gain and power,'' according to the party's annual report.</p>
        <p>And during the past year, Congress membership has declined in all but two of the nine provinces, according to statistics released at the party's national meeting in July.</p>
        <p>This does not mean that the Democratic Alliance will win significant numbers of black converts. The Alliance is the product of the recent merger between the New National Party, whose predecessor created apartheid, and its stronger rival, the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>After all, blacks still vote mostly for blacks, whites still vote mostly for whites and distrust between the races still rankles: When opposition politicians arrived in this Congress stronghold, they discovered that posters of their white leader, Tony Leon, had been torn to shreds.</p>
        <p>Many people still revere the A.N.C. government for giving millions of blacks houses and access to clean water and electricity. And while the Democratic Alliance describes itself as multiracial, it counts painfully few black leaders and members.</p>
        <p>But there is room for opposition inroads. More than a third of potential black voters surveyed just before the 1999 election said they did not feel close to any political party, according to the Institute for Democracy in South Africa.</p>
        <p>The Congress won 66 percent of the vote in 1999 -- up, in fact, from the 62 percent in the previous national election. But political experts believe some people voted for the Congress this time because they did not find credible alternatives. (The New National Party and the Democratic Party together got about 18 percent of the vote.)</p>
        <p>Some blacks are clearly ready to hear a new message. At the rally here, hundreds turned out to shake their fists in support of the Democratic Alliance politicians, who promised to tackle violent crime and the AIDS epidemic.</p>
        <p>''We are determined to stand up on the street corners of South Africa and on every corner of Khayelitsha and to take the resources of the street to the people,'' cried Mr. Leon, and the crowd roared.</p>
        <p>Lawrence Makwela stood in the back of the community hall and peered carefully at the politicians over the eyeglasses sliding down his nose. He vividly recalls the ugly days of apartheid. Still, he would not rule out voting for a white man.</p>
        <p>''I want to hear what he's going to say,'' said Mr. Makwela, 46, who makes his living selling vegetables. ''He's a good leader, but this is an African area. We have to be quite sure they mean business, that they're not taking us for a ride. What kind of message is he going to give to African people? Do we have a future with this Democratic Alliance?''</p>
        <p>That, of course, is the question.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the two former opposition parties, who competed fiercely for white, Indian and mixed-race voters until their merger in June, say they can expand their support among blacks, who make up more than 70 percent of the population. The Alliance registered as a new party in mid-August.</p>
        <p>The party's goal is to cut the A.N.C.'s share of the vote to below 50 percent by 2009, in the presidential election after next.</p>
        <p>But many political analysts remain unconvinced.</p>
        <p>''The discontent is there, but the real debate is over whether anybody can capitalize on it,'' said Adam Habib, a professor of politics at the University of Durban-Westville. ''You need a political structure, and that hasn't emerged yet.''</p>
        <p>The predominantly black Inkatha Freedom Party, once the Congress's most bitter rival, has considered merging with the governing party because its supporters are now largely A.N.C. voters and the party's leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, is now minister of home affairs.</p>
        <p>To those who dismiss the Democratic Alliance's quest for black support, the party's strategists point to Zimbabwe. There, an unlikely alliance of white business executives and black workers recently won more than a third of the seats in Parliament and generated the first strong opposition since the end of white rule 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>The Alliance leaders here do not expect such radical changes. Instead, they are wooing working-class blacks with an eye toward winning 5 percent of the black vote in the next presidential election, in 2004, and 9 to 12 percent by the vote in 2009.</p>
        <p>The party has selected Joe Seremane, a black member of Parliament and a former political prisoner, as its national chairman. And it is visiting local townships to hear community concerns.</p>
        <p>''The challenge is to become a party that black voters can identify with,'' said Ryan Coetzee, the political strategist for the Democratic Alliance. ''We've got to build up credibility. You've got to go where they live and you've got to deliver. White voters don't want you to pitch up at the shopping mall. But black voters want to see that you care and see that you identify with them.''</p>
        <p>A.N.C. officials contend, however -- and most political experts seem to agree -- that the Alliance has a long way to go before it sheds its image as a party for wealthy whites. (Opposition officials recently toured Hammanskraal, an impoverished community north of Pretoria, in a caravan full of shiny Mercedes-Benzes.)</p>
        <p>At the Alliance rally here in Khayelitsha, only one of the six people who addressed the crowd spoke fluent Xhosa, and she was a longtime A.N.C. worker who had joined the opposition only eight days earlier.</p>
        <p>The Xhosa speaker, Nontsikelelo Jaxa, said the Democratic Alliance should not expect a quick surge in black membership. ''It was a very, very difficult decision to make, joining the D.A.,'' she said. ''You find yourself feeling like you're betraying your own people.''</p>
        <p>The A.N.C. has dismissed the alliance as a ploy to preserve white privilege, as an attempt by whites to regain political power so they can halt affirmative action and other programs designed to empower blacks.</p>
        <p>But there is no doubt that the governing party is worried about losing disaffected voters. Unemployment runs as high as 40 percent by some estimates. Crime rates are high and frustration is simmering.</p>
        <p>At the A.N.C.'s meeting in July, President Thabo Mbeki warned that the party could lose power if it loses touch with the masses. He said there is no room in the Congress for people who join in the hope it will help them grow rich.</p>
        <p>''There are many instances in Africa and elsewhere in the world that show what happens when, on becoming a ruling party, a genuinely popular national liberation movement such as ours loses contact with the people and its leaders transform themselves into a self-centered ruling elite,'' Mr. Mbeki warned.</p>
        <p>The Congress says it has already taken steps to solve its problems. The party has audited city councils, condemned corruption in its ranks and pledged that local politicians will be more responsive.</p>
        <p>But some experts say that Mr. Leon, the leader of the Democratic Alliance, has the personality to rally support in ways that Mr. Mbeki cannot. While the bookish president rarely ventures among ordinary people, Mr. Leon wandered down the streets here, shaking hands with astonished citizens, visiting local clinics and discussing the shortages of medicines and supplies.</p>
        <p>Richard Ntuli, a black opposition party member, accompanied Mr. Leon on the trip to Hammanskraal and introduced him to the local chief, who welcomed him warmly. Mr. Ntuli acknowledges that translating that welcome into votes will not be easy. But he emphasizes that the campaign is just beginning.</p>
        <p>''The man in the street would say I'm a sellout,'' he admitted. ''But I tell them: 'The political liberation struggle is over. The struggle is about economic liberation now, and we don't need AK-47's for that. We need a new party.' ''</p>
