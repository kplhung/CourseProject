        <p>Jeff Madrick column on Census Bureau data showing persistent erosion of income of male workers since early 1970's, which he says helps explain the potency of Vice Pres Al Gore's call at Democratic convention to help working families; says that women have had to fill the breach in family income, with a far higher proporton of them now working, and that although their wages have risen substantially on average, their pay remains roughly 20 percent below what men make; photo (M)</p>

        <p>MAKE no mistake about how good the last five years have been to Americans. The usually cautious economists at the Economic Policy Institute point out in their new edition of ''The State of Working America'' that wages went up strongly across the board since 1996, even for low-income workers. In the meantime, low levels of unemployment meant that many who dropped out of the labor force were back at work, and jobs, in general, were more stable. Small wonder that Americans are confident again.</p>
        <p>But what is too often ignored is that this remarkable performance has not yet compensated for the persistent erosion of the income of male workers since the early 1970's. And this goes a long way toward explaining why Al Gore's message at the Democratic convention to help working families seems to have caught on. Women have had to fill the breach, with a far higher proportion of them now working.

        <p>MAKE no mistake about how good the last five years have been to Americans. The usually cautious economists at the Economic Policy Institute point out in their new edition of ''The State of Working America'' that wages went up strongly across the board since 1996, even for low-income workers. In the meantime, low levels of unemployment meant that many who dropped out of the labor force were back at work, and jobs, in general, were more stable. Small wonder that Americans are confident again.</p>
        <p>But what is too often ignored is that this remarkable performance has not yet compensated for the persistent erosion of the income of male workers since the early 1970's. And this goes a long way toward explaining why Al Gore's message at the Democratic convention to help working families seems to have caught on. Women have had to fill the breach, with a far higher proportion of them now working. But although their wages have risen substantially on average, their pay remains roughly 20 percent below what men earn.</p>
        <p>Few of the instant television analysts at the convention grasped the point. ''Contentment'' is the tenor of the times, one pundit asserted, asserting that Mr. Gore was misreading the electorate. The going line was this: Maybe we should worry about the poor and those without health insurance, but should we really be concerned with most of working America?</p>
        <p>A few facts will help. The Census Bureau provides a useful measure of income by sex that includes not just wages and salaries for all workers, which are typically cited by analysts, but also sources of income like rent and interest as well as government transfers like Social Security benefits and unemployment insurance. The bureau also provides data by age group and for the typical, or median, worker -- the worker who earns more than half of all workers and less than the other half.</p>
        <p>I have also had the data discounted for the latest estimates of inflation, which adjust incomes upward for improvements in the quality and variety of products. Thus the following conclusions are based on a quite generous estimate of income growth.</p>
        <p>Despite significant gains recently, the median male worker has fared poorly since the 1970's. In fact, adjusted for inflation, the median worker in the 25-to-34 age group earned 13 percent less in 1998 (the latest data available) than did the median worker of the same age in 1973.</p>
        <p>Median workers in the 35-to-44 age group earned about 9 percent less in 1998 than their counterparts 25 years earlier. And the 45-to-54 median-income group essentially stagnated since 1973, up only slightly. By comparison, in the post-World War II period, median incomes for these age groups rose 50 to 100 percent over 25 years.</p>
        <p>But even if overall incomes fell compared with levels for equivalent workers in the past, how did men do as they grew more experienced at work and built up financial and real estate assets over time? The same data allows us to assess this, and the findings are sobering.</p>
        <p>Beginning in the 1970's and persisting into the 1990's, the incomes of a majority of men under 35 rose about half as fast as they did in earlier decades and the incomes of a majority of men aged roughly 35 or older essentially stagnated or fell.</p>
        <p>To take but one example, the median income of a male aged 35 to 44 in 1988 was $39,331. In 1998, after inflation, the equivalent man, now 10 years older, took in $300 less. To match the gains typically made in the 1950's and 1960's, the median income should have been approximately $51,000 by 1998.</p>
        <p>Updating the data through 2000 would improve the performance of the last 25 years only slightly.</p>
        <p>Some economists say such data does not tell the whole story. Incomes for the top 20 percent of men rose rapidly the last 25 years, and some assert that because income mobility is greater now, many in the lower 80 percent occasionally climb into the highest quintile. But claims of greater income mobility have been criticized by both conservative and liberal economists.</p>
        <p>A more relevant criticism is that even if incomes stagnate, Americans can buy many more exciting new products at low and falling prices. Even the poor own VCR's, microwave ovens and Sony Walkmans. But the costs of products and services that some may view as even more critical to modern life than a VCR -- housing, education, medical care and public transit -- have all risen much faster than incomes since the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>It is an extraordinary social achievement that so many women now have the opportunity to work. But the inescapable fact is that if women did not work, most family incomes would not have risen at all in the 1980's and 1990's. The median annual income of a two-worker family is now about $60,000. The median family income of a one-worker family is about $32,000.</p>
        <p>The resulting pressures are obvious. A parent now stays at home full-time in fewer than one of four families, compared with two of three in the 1950's. In half of all families, both parents work, compared with one of five in the 1950's. Twenty-five percent of all families are headed by a single parent, typically a mother.</p>
        <p>This is a new reality in America. Despite five years of prosperity, the poor are still not doing well, and working families in the broad middle are in need of relief -- both from long work hours and from the pressures of the rising cost of education, health care and other requirements for a middle-class life. And the cost of professional child care has risen much faster than have incomes.</p>
        <p>Surveys by two sociologists, Jerry Jacobs of the University of Pennsylvania and Kathleen Gerson of New York University, among others, show that those who work especially long hours want to work less. And those who work short hours, usually earning too little, want to work more.</p>
        <p>For a long time, both political parties put the best face on these grinding facts. Mr. Gore simply let the cat out of the bag. My guess is that George W. Bush is beginning to get the message, even if the instant media pundits are not.</p>
