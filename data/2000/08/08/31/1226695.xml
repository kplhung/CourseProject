        <p>Andre Agassi's personal struggle has become glaringly public: a front-page tabloid headline yesterday told of his mother's and his sister's battles with breast cancer.</p>
        <p>''I hope he didn't see that,'' Brad Gilbert, Agassi's coach, said after Agassi practiced for an hour with Chris Woodruff.</p>
        <p>Agassi, who declined to comment yesterday, discussed the illnesses briefly Monday night when Mary Carillo of CBS asked him.</p>
        <p>Gil Reyes, Agassi's trainer and bodyguard, won't broach the topic.</p>
        <p>''It is so personal to him, I don't ask him,'' Reyes said. ''We don't talk about it not because I can't, but because I don't. I'm sure we will when he's ready. I don't ask him about it out of respect.''</p>
        <p>But Carillo said last night that Agassi knew the questions were coming. She learned that Agassi was dealing with the illnesses earlier this month when he flew back and forth to Las Vegas during the Tennis Masters Series tournament in Ohio. She said that she asked Agassi if she could bring it up on the air and that he said, ''Yes, ask me about it,'' Carillo recalled. ''I obviously did not mean to cause a sensation, but it's going to be a very big part of his U.S. Open.''</p>
        <p>Gilbert said that Agassi's family concerns could be one factor in his struggles this summer, in addition to back soreness. Agassi, who plays Arnaud Clement of France this afternoon in the second round, has not won a tournament since the Australian Open in January.</p>
        <p>''It's probably a little bit of everything,'' Gilbert said. ''If he can just get through to the second week and find his groove, and get more confidence, he'll be O.K.''</p>
