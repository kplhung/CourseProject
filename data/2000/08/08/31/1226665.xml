        <p>This is a new 30-second commercial, called ''Stand,'' which the New York State Democratic Party began broadcasting Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- David Axelrod.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The advertisement takes a ''man on the street'' approach, a departure from the previous commercials for the Senate campaign. It opens with a closeup of a woman as the off-camera narrator asks, ''Excuse me, did you know that for four years Rick Lazio was deputy whip to Newt Gingrich in Congress?''  The woman looks stunned and says she did not know. The announcer makes a series of statements about Mr. Lazio's record, as phrases like ''$270 billion in Medicare cuts'' scroll across the screen. The camera cuts from one wholesome-looking person to another, each of them looking surprised.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''Excuse me, did you now that for four years, Rick Lazio was deputy whip to Newt Gingrich in Congress?''</p>
        <p>''No, I didn't know that.''</p>
        <p>''This does surprise me.''</p>
        <p>''And that he helped write and pass the Gingrich budget, with two hundred and seventy billion in Medicare cuts?''</p>
        <p>''I find that rather disappointing, yes.''</p>
        <p>''I thought he was more pro-health care.''</p>
        <p>''And that Lazio followed Gingrich's lead and voted for the largest education cuts in history?''</p>
        <p>''Oh my goodness, I didn't know that.''</p>
        <p>''That's not good.''</p>
        <p>''Tell Lazio to stop playing both sides.''</p>
        <p>''Who knew?''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The narrator sounds as if he is revealing deep, dark secrets about Mr. Lazio: his votes to reduce Medicare spending and to make the largest national education spending cut in history. But the Clinton campaign has attacked Mr. Lazio on Medicare and education spending in its commercials before, based on the same two votes. Mr. Lazio voted to cut the rate of growth in Medicare spending, not the Medicare budget, as his campaign reiterated yesterday. The cut in education spending, the campaign insisted, was smaller than one proposed by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The Democrats seem to think that reminding voters of Mr. Lazio's link to Newt Gingrich may be an effective move, although the Clinton campaign tried and abandoned that tactic weeks ago. What is most notable about the commercial is the absence of slickness and the use of ordinary people reacting to Mr. Lazio's record. The ad is financed with so-called soft money --  unregulated contributions that legally cannot be spent to promote individual candidates. Employing a loophole now widely used by both major parties, the Democrats use a script that attacks Mr. Lazio but never explicitly refers to the Senate race.</p>
