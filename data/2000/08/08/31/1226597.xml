        <p>Bill Parcells still does not sleep well after games, fretting about what he could do as the Jets' director of football operations to improve the team.</p>
        <p>And so he took a copy of the waiver wire home with him last week, an indication that Parcells is still very much a power within the Jets even as to the outside world his outsize personality has retreated into the cocoon of the front office.</p>
        <p>Until next week, that is, when Parcells's diary-like chronicle of his final season as the Jets' coach, ''The Final Season, My Last Year as Head Coach in the N.F.L.'' (William Morrow &amp; Co.) hits the bookstores. The book will be replete with his version of the bizarre events that enveloped the Jets during the last year.</p>
        <p>In the book, Parcells expresses dismay at Bill Belichick's stunning resignation and discusses his role in the trade of Keyshawn Johnson.</p>
        <p>Now that he is no longer a coach, Parcells does not give interviews to the reporters who cover the team, although he has appeared on radio and television shows.</p>
        <p>But in an interview arranged to promote his book, Parcells said he still does not know what his future holds, beyond a conversation he will have with the team's owner, Woody Johnson, at the end of this season about what he wants to do.</p>
        <p>But Parcells is sure of one thing: he will not coach again.</p>
        <p>''I know it's over for me,'' he said in the interview in his office last week on his 59th birthday. ''I'm done. I love this game. I miss winning. I don't miss the rest. There's no gamesmanship here. I have no agenda. I have nothing else on my mind.''</p>
        <p>About his successor as head coach, Al Groh, Parcells said: ''Everybody says 'Parcells's shadow.' Parcells's shadow isn't here. He's going to be his own guy. We've probably had five 10-minute meetings. That's about it. I think I'd be a good guidance counselor for football players, to try to teach them how to succeed in this business. Not to coach them. To teach them what it takes to be successful.''</p>
        <p>Parcells elaborated in the interview on the two most compelling items in the book. On his relationship with Belichick, the assistant head coach who was expected to take his place when Parcells stepped down, Parcells said he had begun the process of passing the baton to Belichick during last season, consulting him on personnel matters for the future. But on the day in early January when Parcells retired as coach and Belichick was publicly named the new head coach, Belichick indicated that he was having second thoughts because the team was being sold.</p>
        <p>Parcells made a thinly veiled suggestion that he suspected there was something in the works between Belichick and the New England Patriots before Belichick quit the Jets and took over the Patriots.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't prove any of this and I'm not accusing anything,'' Parcells said. ''I just thought it was unusual that you plan on something for three years and at the last minute, something changes. It was a little bit surprising.''</p>
        <p>Belichick, when asked for a comment, referred to a statement he made about the book several weeks ago.</p>
        <p>''Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about events that have taken place,'' he said in the statement. ''Some of those opinions have been supportive and others haven't, but one thing is certain: it is in everybody's best interest that I take the high road.''</p>
        <p>On the trading of Keyshawn Johnson, Parcells said his job had been to present options to Groh and Woody Johnson about how to deal with the wide receiver. But he remained coy about where he stood on the trade.</p>
        <p>Parcells writes in his book that he was convinced that if the Jets did nothing -- that is, if they did not rework Johnson's contract and did not trade him -- Johnson would very likely have been bitter and disruptive entering this season.</p>
        <p>''What they said was 'We want to get paid here or get paid someplace else,' '' Parcells said of Johnson and his agent. ''At some point, you have to decide what's worth it to your franchise. I wouldn't necessarily say the best solution was to trade him. We weren't intent on trading this player. We had new circumstances here: a new coach, a new owner. My job was to present them all the options. At the end of the day, if they would have made a judgment in the absolute worst interest of the franchise, I would have said something.''</p>
        <p>Parcells said Groh had decided that the Jets should try to trade Johnson, although Parcells said that if no team had offered two first-round draft picks, as Tampa Bay ultimately did, the Jets probably would have rejected a deal.</p>
        <p>Still, Parcells did not say clearly what he thought the Jets should have done, and that has allowed Johnson to claim publicly that Parcells would not have traded him if he had still been the coach.</p>
        <p>''I'm not trying to say I didn't agree with the decision made,'' Parcells said. ''I have to support what those people want, the owner and the coach. Hypothetically, I don't think you can assume that things would necessarily have been different if I was the coach.''</p>
