        <p>Senior advisers to Gov. George W. Bush met here today with representatives from three television networks to discuss presidential debates that individual networks have proposed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said that he will participate in three debates and that he wants those debates to be watched by as many television viewers as possible. But he has not agreed to the three debates proposed by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which are by far the most likely to garner prime-time coverage by all the major networks as opposed to an individual network sponsor.</p>
        <p>The commission, an independent, bipartisan group that consults with all of the networks on acceptable dates and times for debates before proposing its schedule, has sponsored all of the general-election presidential debates starting with the 1988 campaign.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush instead chooses one or more debates sponsored by individual networks, there is a strong likelihood that networks other than the one sponsoring the debate would not televise it, and that the audience for the event would be diminished.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides said that was not their aim, and that it was one of the factors they were weighing and discussing with network executives. A trio of Mr. Bush's senior advisers met today with representatives from CNN, ABC and CBS, and these advisers were scheduled to meet on Thursday with representatives from Fox, NBC and PBS, said Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman.</p>
        <p>''The governor believes the debates should be seen as widely as possible,'' Mr. Fleischer said, echoing comments that Mr. Bush made on Tuesday as he tried to beat back news reports that he might be casting around for formats that would not be as prominently broadcast.</p>
        <p>But by not yet agreeing to the commission's debates and publicly entertaining other options, Mr. Bush has opened himself to accusations by aides to Vice President Al Gore that he is trying to minimize the impact of the debates or contrive formats tailor-made to his preferences and strengths.</p>
        <p>''He says he wants a big audience, so it's a mystery why he wouldn't accept the commission debates,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has essentially signed off on the commission debates and accepted invitations to 42 others, a number that is almost unimaginable from a logistical standpoint and clearly intended to provide a contrast to Mr. Bush's response and paint the Texas governor as timid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides said they simply believed that the two major party's nominees should have some say over the shape of the debates and were trying to exert that privilege.</p>
        <p>Several political strategists said that Mr. Bush might have an enormous public-relations problem if he did not consent to all or at least two of the commission's debates.</p>
        <p>They also said that his advisers' activities this week might be nothing more than a way of playing hard-to-get and gaining some leverage with the commission over certain details of its proposed debates. Mr. Bush's advisers are to meet here with members of the commission on Friday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's remarks in recent days, and the comments of several of his aides, suggest that he prefers informal formats to formal ones. Officials with the Bush campaign have also questioned the neutrality of one of the commission's proposed debate sites, a building in Boston near the John F. Kennedy Library.</p>
        <p>Asked whether that site could be changed in negotiations, Janet Brown, the executive director of the commission, indicated profound reluctance but did not flatly rule it out.</p>
        <p>''The venues and the dates have been in the works for 18 months, and we've done a lot of groundwork,'' Ms. Brown said. ''There's never been an objection to one of our sites on the merits, and I think that all of the sites we have for 2000 are very good.''</p>
