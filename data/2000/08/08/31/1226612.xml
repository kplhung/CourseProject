        <p>''Monstrous'' is the word used by Portland's mayor, Vera Katz. The executive director of the Port of Portland says the city's reputation has been tarred by ''Gestapo-type actions.'' A state senator here says the conduct in question is ''racist and xenophobic.'' And United States Senator Gordon H. Smith, a Republican, put it this way today, ''We don't want Portland to be known as ''Deportland.''</p>
        <p>All four are talking about the conduct of the local branch of the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service. The furor has been fanned by the recent strip-search and two-night jailing of a Chinese businesswoman who had landed here on her way to New York. But public officials were already concerned that immigration agents were detaining or deporting foreign travelers at a much higher rate than at other West Coast airports.</p>
        <p>For Portland, which labored mightily to persuade Delta Air Lines to establish a minihub here with nonstop flights to Asia, the controversy over the immigration office has been a blow to the city's image abroad. The South China Morning Post reported recently that the city was already known as ''Deportland'' in some Asian countries, and the Kyodo News Service of Japan has also reported on the problems, prompting some Japanese travel agencies to advise their customers to avoid flying through Portland if possible.</p>
        <p>Delta has already scaled back its cross-Pacific flights to Portland to two a day, both from Japan, having once had four daily nonstops, including flights from Seoul, South Korea,  and Taipei, Taiwan.</p>
        <p>And, citing fears that the controversy over the immigration service's treatment of foreigners here might lead the airline to scrap them altogether, public officials here have begun mounting a furious campaign to revamp the office. The mayor, the governor and both United States senators here, as well as one from neighboring Washington State, have all called for the resignation of the local director.</p>
        <p>For Portland, which prides itself on being one of the nation's more livable and culturally tolerant cities, the entire controversy is strange and wounding, and it could have severe economic consequences. A Port of Portland study said that losing the direct air link to Asia could cost the city as much as $900 million a year in lost trade and tourism. And even as the immigration agency has faced accusations of mistreatment or insensitivity in its dealings with foreigners at ports-of-entry around the country, the criticism here is particularly harsh, prompting officials to promise a complete review of the Portland office.</p>
        <p>''We are absolutely committed to restoring public confidence in our operations at P.D.X.,'' said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the agency's western division, using the three-letter airport code for Portland. ''We will not rest until the job is done.''</p>
        <p>Inspectors at the Portland airport will be given additional training in ''cultural awareness and professional communications skills,'' Ms. Kice said, and the western regional director for the agency, Johnny Williams, traveled to Portland on Monday to meet with public officials and announce other procedures, including higher-level authorization for decisions to detain or search foreigners arriving at the airport, and a better system for translation.</p>
        <p>Even as they acknowledged that Portland's deportation rates were demonstrably higher than those in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, immigration officials noted that the vast majority of foreigners were admitted into the country at any of those airports, and that rate differences between Portland and other West Coast airports had narrowed significantly in the past year.</p>
        <p>According to the immigration agency, from May through July of this year, Portland turned back 58 of 34,694 foreigners arriving here, meaning it admitted 99.83 percent of them. Seattle admitted all but 80 of 122,633 (99.94 percent), and Los Angeles admitted all but 752 of 1,236,679 (also 99.94 percent).</p>
        <p>Moreover, officials said, there may be additional reasons that Portland has a higher rate of deportations. Because it has much smaller numbers of foreign travelers, they said, agents here may actually be able to do a better job of screening out counterfeit documents, and a higher percentage of people arriving here are workers, who are more likely than tourists to have problems proving they have the proper authorization to remain in the country.</p>
        <p>None of that, however, seems to have quelled the public outrage here or the perception abroad that Portland is a bad place to enter the country. And the strip-search treatment of the Chinese businesswoman, which was first reported by The Oregonian, a daily newspaper here, was described as the ''last straw'' by Mike Thorne, the executive director of the Port of Portland.</p>
        <p>The woman, Guo Liming, of Guangzhou, China, arrived here on an Aug. 19 flight. An agent, who has not been publicly identified by the immigration service, decided that her passport was suspicious because the laminate over the photograph was loose, indicating that the photograph could have been replaced.</p>
        <p>The director of the office here, David Beebe, later told a reporter that the woman also ''fit the profile'' of an illegal immigrant because she was traveling with another person -- a man who turned out to be her fiance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Guo was shortly removed to a room where she was ordered to strip down to her underwear, and was inspected by two female agents. She was then handcuffed and taken to Northern Oregon Regional Corrections Facility in The Dalles, Ore., 80 miles away, while the agency investigated whether her passport was bogus. Inspectors declined to tell her fiance, Hsieh Tsuhui, where she was, and he hired a Portland immigration lawyer to track her down.</p>
        <p>After spending two nights in jail, Ms. Guo was told by the immigration service that her passport was indeed authentic, and they brought her back to the airport for a flight to New York. Mr. Beebe initially defended the agency's treatment of her, but after the Oregonian article about her ordeal set off a storm of outrage, he reviewed the incident, announced that agents had erred in their handling of her, and offered Ms. Guo an apology. Ms. Guo is traveling and could not be reached for an interview, said her Portland lawyer, Bao Lin Chen.</p>
        <p>The incident was not an isolated one: the immigration service here has come under fire for jailings of other foreigners, including six Chinese teenagers seeking asylum. But Mr. Beebe has resisted calls from elected officials for his resignation, and the agency has not announced any disciplinary action against the agents who dealt with Ms. Guo. Mr. Beebe referred calls to the immigration service's regional office in Laguna Niguel, Calif. Mr. Williams, the director there, said it was too early to call for anyone's dismissal here. ''You would not jump to that kind of a decision without benefit of a full look at all the issues at hand,'' he said.</p>
