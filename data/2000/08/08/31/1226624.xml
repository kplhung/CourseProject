        <p>In the latest installment in a Congressional race that has become increasingly bitter, State Senator Larry B. Seabrook yesterday accused his opponent, Representative Eliot Engel, of obtaining sealed divorce records and supplying them to the media to embarrass him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seabrook was reacting to an article in The Daily News yesterday. It stated that, according to sealed records, his ex-wife had said that the senator had secretly divorced her but had continued to file joint tax returns for several years.</p>
        <p>''I am certain that Eliot Engel's campaign is peddling this story around,'' Mr. Seabrook said. ''My private life and anything that has to do with my family and my ex-wife have no place in a campaign.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Seabrook, in accusing Mr. Engel of involvement in obtaining sealed divorce records, said that the congressman's activities amounted to a ''a public lynching of an opponent.'' He added, ''underhanded and offensive tactics will not deter me from campaigning vigorously.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Engel denied having a role in obtaining or disseminating any record relating to Mr. Seabrook's divorce.</p>
        <p>''I knew nothing about it until I read The Daily News today,'' Mr. Engel said, at a news conference at City Hall where he was endorsed by Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi.</p>
        <p>''Larry Seabrook has a bad enough record in his public life to pick apart,'' Mr. Engel said. ''I don't think private lives are relevant. Larry Seabrook has these questions swirling around him all the time -- and where there's smoke, there's fire. We will continue to raise questions about his ethics and morals.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Seabrook said his lawyers planned to file a suit against Mr. Engel's campaign charging it with  obtaining and giving out sealed court documents.</p>
        <p>The Daily News article said that Mr. Seabrook had obtained a divorce in 1993 without his wife's knowledge and that Mrs. Seabrook did not discover that the divorce had become official until 1999. It also stated that in 1993, after the couple had been legally divorced, the senator, saying he was married, secured a bank loan and that his ex-wife had signed the loan papers.</p>
        <p>The race between Mr. Seabrook and Mr. Engel in the Bronx-Westchester district is viewed as being particularly tight: the district is largely black and includes many of the same neighborhoods represented in the State Senate by Mr. Seabrook.  Mr. Seabrook is black and Mr. Engel is white.</p>
        <p>The race has been volatile for months. Mr. Seabrook is being backed by the Bronx Democratic Party, which broke with its tradition of supporting incumbents. And Mr. Engel has relentlessly charged Mr. Seabrook with a series of ethical lapses, from absenteeism in the State Senate to misuse of public funds.</p>
        <p>Of the charges in the article, Mr. Seabrook said that he filed joint tax returns only while the divorce proceedings were ongoing. ''When I received official information that I was divorced, I stopped filing joint returns.'' He said that his former wife was served papers about the divorce proceedings. ''There is no such thing as a secret divorce,'' Mr. Seabrook said. ''Notice has to be given and notice was given.''</p>
        <p>LaVerne Seabrook, Mr. Seabrook's former wife, also released a statement yesterday, saying that she did not wish to discuss the matter publicly.</p>
        <p>''I did not give any documents regarding our divorce to the media,'' she said. ''Our children have had to go through a protracted divorce and a story such as this is extremely painful for them. We are simply trying to move on with our lives and we ask for privacy.''</p>
        <p>In an interview a few weeks ago, Mrs. Seabrook declined to provide any details about her divorce.</p>
