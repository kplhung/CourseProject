        <p>Deep in One Part of Texas</p>
        <p>Weighing in on Robert Altman's fashion satire, ''Ready to Wear,'' six years ago, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''Beyond being so slack, the bleached, hazy 'Ready to Wear' commits the cardinal fashion sin: it doesn't even look good.''</p>
        <p>Critics might have a hard time leveling that particular complaint about Mr. Altman's newest movie, ''Dr. T and the Women,'' which opens in a few weeks and stars Richard Gere as a Dallas gynecologist who ministers to the kind of women (played by Laura Dern, Kate Hudson and Farrah Fawcett, among others) who wear rose-colored mink cuffs on their wrists and ostrich-feathered hats to lunch.</p>
        <p>With the help of Dona Granata as costume designer, Mr. Altman, it seems, has made his true fashion movie. To research the kind of Texas woman the director was trying to portray, Ms. Granata spent time going to Dallas fund-raisers and taking notes at Stanley Korshak, the city's well-known upmarket specialty store. In fact, a saleswoman in bridal wear there ended up with a role in the movie.</p>
        <p>''Some of the young women are very much in the New York black mode,'' Ms. Granata observed, ''but they'll put on some outrageous shoe or a really big piece of jewelry, and that wouldn't happen in New York. In Dallas, surgery starts young and diamonds are a girl's best friend.''</p>
        <p>So, too, are Dior bags, Dior miniskirt suits, stamped leather jackets from Escada and various outrageously styled numbers from St. John. Of one especially garish number worn by Laura Dern -- a fur-trimmed road-sign-yellow cape with matching fur-trimmed stiletto boots -- Ms. Granata said: ''Women were actually buying that. It's real. I didn't make it up.''</p>
        <p>A World of Talent</p>
        <p>When New York Fashion Week gets under way in the middle of next month, this premier showcase for American fashion will feel, well, slightly less American than usual. ''What we're doing is a kind of international summit,'' Fern Mallis, executive director of Seventh on Sixth, which organizes Fashion Week, said the other day. The 10 days of men's and women's shows begin on Sept. 13.</p>
        <p>On Saturday Sept. 16 and throughout the following week, an unprecedented number of little-known designers from around the world will show their clothes in Bryant Park, among other sites. They are coming from Hong Kong, Portugal, Brazil, South Africa and Nigeria. The five African designers -- one from Nigeria and four from South Africa -- are the winners of a continent-wide design competition that had Mark Eisen, a Seventh Avenue designer by way of South Africa, as a judge.</p>
        <p>''They've all been coming and calling and wanting to show in New York,'' Ms. Mallis said.</p>
        <p>Apart from this international jamboree, Lizzy Disney, a British designer, will be part of Moet &amp; Chandon's Designer Debut show. Also, the Parisian Nicolas Ghesquiere, the designer for Balenciaga, will show his line for the Italian label Callaghan for the first time here as well.</p>
        <p>Marc Jacobs, Major and Minor</p>
        <p>Conspiracy theorists might see it an effort to ward off the foreign invasion: the quintessentially American designer Marc Jacobs is holding not one show this coming season, but two.</p>
        <p>In September, in addition to his Marc Jacobs line, the designer will inaugurate his secondary line, which, assuming trademark issues are hammered out, will be called Marc. (Doom-sayers will remember that Isaac Mizrahi's ill-fated secondary line was called Isaac.)</p>
        <p>''We know we're missing a segment of the population because of our price point,'' Robert Duffy, president of Mr. Jacobs's company, explained. That segment of the population includes the many who see no reason to pay $800 for a Marc Jacobs sweater.</p>
        <p>The collection, Mr. Duffy said, will be priced below those of most secondary lines -- probably below $200 for that sweater. It will feature knits, shoes and bags, among other pieces. ''It's modeled after the way people we know dress,'' Mr. Duffy continued. ''No one wears designer head to toe.''</p>
        <p>The line will be shown at the Stuart Parr gallery in West Chelsea with the help of Juergen Teller photographs and about two dozen live models.</p>
