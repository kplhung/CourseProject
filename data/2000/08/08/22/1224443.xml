        <p>Spelling the possible demise for the phrase ''as scarce as hen's teeth,'' a team of researchers at Harvard Medical School and elsewhere has succeeded in making chick embryos grow tooth buds.</p>
        <p>This is not a rehearsal for ''Jurassic Aviary'' -- the earliest birds like archaeopteryx sported menacing rows of teeth along their beaks -- but rather a test of new knowledge about how organs are generated in developing embryos.</p>
        <p>Mice are often used to study mammalian development, and teeth are easy to work with because they grow well outside the body. Researchers at Harvard and elsewhere figured that a natural substance known as BMP4, which plays a central role in the development of mouse teeth, might be absent in birds, and that suppression of the gene that makes it might be the reason modern day birds do not have teeth.</p>
        <p>By inserting BMP4-laden beads into the jaw region of chick embryos, they showed that tooth buds would develop, Dr. Richard Maas and colleagues report in today's issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
        <p>Presumably, birds have retained the basic genetic apparatus for developing teeth, even though they ceased to grow them some 60 million years ago. But through a genetic change that occurred at that time, they ceased to produce the vital BMP4 protein at the embryo's tooth-formation stage.</p>
        <p>In mice, two classes of cells are generated which swathe the tooth buds in layers of dentin and enamel. This did not occur with the tooth buds in the treated chicks, presumably because birds had lost the ability to make these two substances.</p>
        <p>Dr. Maas said there had been brisk progress in understanding tooth formation in the last six years, largely because of ''knock-out mice.'' These are strains of mice in which a single gene has been deleted. Finding strains that are completely or partly toothless helps identify genes that are vital for tooth development.</p>
        <p>The emerging picture is that teeth develop through genetically signaled interactions between two sheets of embryonic cells, known as the epithelium and the mesenchyme. First the epithelium signals the mesenchyme, then the mesenchyme induces the epithelial sheet to bud into it. Within this bud a tooth develops. BMP4, short for bone morphogenetic protein No. 4, is a major factor in the initial formation of the bud.</p>
        <p>So far at least 25 different genes have been found to be involved in the development of mouse teeth. Probably all of them have counterparts in people. After a knock-out mouse lacking the gene known as Msx1 was generated, a human family was found who lacked one of their two copies of the gene. Their primary teeth are fine, but they fail to develop the set that replaces the milk teeth.</p>
        <p>The bioengineering of human teeth is more complicated than mouse teeth since people live much longer and need more durable dentition. The fact that the second set of teeth develops later in life is an exception to the rule that most organ development occurs exclusively in the womb.</p>
        <p>That raises the question of whether the factors discovered by tooth biologists may someday be useful in generating new teeth in humans. ''Maybe you could stimulate yet one more round of replacement if you understood how these pathways worked,'' Dr. Maas said.</p>
        <p>If other organs develop in a similar way, the organ-shaping genes discovered by embryologists may one day help to repair damaged organs or even generate new ones in the laboratory, perhaps using the versatile stem cells that seem to be part of each organ's natural repair kit.</p>
        <p>''We have entered an era where we can begin to understand organ fates based on molecular principles,'' Dr. Maas said. ''The field is clearly headed in the direction of organ regeneration. If you understood all the different pathways you could hope to influence organ development.''</p>
