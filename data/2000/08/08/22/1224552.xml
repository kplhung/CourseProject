        <p>SafetyTips.com, a site that specializes in safety consulting and training, may be near a deal to buy APBNews.com, a faltering Web site covering crime, justice and safety that sought Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection last month. APBNews said it had agreed to be purchased for $950,000, but the deal is subject to competition from other bidders and would need the approval of the federal bankruptcy court in New York.
