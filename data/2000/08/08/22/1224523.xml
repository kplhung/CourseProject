        <p>SEAN KENNIFF, the neurologist from Long Island, was voted off the ''Survivor'' island last week, to the satisfaction of many viewers, especially women. He had seemed the prototypically clueless, unreliable guy.</p>
        <p>Blind to the intricate social dynamics on the island, he had ignored the growing evidence -- and the pleas of his more observant female friends -- that a secret alliance had formed against them. Instead of joining with the women in a counteralliance, he doomed them all by persisting with his own alphabetical system of voting. It was easy to see why he deserved to go.</p>
        <p>The mystery was why he and other guys managed to stay on so long. ''Survivor'' seemed a rare female-friendly game show. Although men had an advantage in the physical contests requiring strength and speed, the overall format of the competition appeared well suited to women's subtle social skills at networking and cooperation.</p>
        <p>Yet the women are not ahead going into tomorrow night's grand finale. The program, which began with eight of each sex, now has two men and two women remaining, and the women may be in a more precarious position because they've been arguing with each other.</p>
        <p>Men excel at simple, quick, competitive tasks, which is why they have done so well on shows like ''Jeopardy!'' and ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Their testosterone helps them focus. Women are better at seeing the whole complex picture. They notice social nuances and cultivate personal relationships, creating what anthropologists call lateral networks instead of status hierarchies. They're experts at cooperating, but they can also be quietly ruthless.</p>
        <p>While boys are punching each other on the playground, girls are learning to emotionally devastate victims who don't even know what hit them. Females prefer indirect aggression, which Anne Campbell described last year in an article in Behavioral and Brain Sciences journal.</p>
        <p>''Indirect aggression by its nature seeks to conceal the identity of the attacker and should therefore be less appealing to boys,'' wrote Dr. Campbell, a psychologist at Durham University in England. While boys need to demonstrate their status by publicly vanquishing rivals, girls prefer to use ''acts of shunning, stigmatizing and gossiping,'' she explained.</p>
        <p>''Girls are more likely to exclude newcomers than are boys, to destroy their adversary's property or tell tales on them, and to use tactics of ostracizing and manipulating public opinion,'' Dr. Campbell wrote, summarizing others' studies. Girls are also more likely to become ''friendly with someone else as revenge,'' she noted, and in the adult workplace women have been found more likely to spread false rumors or stop speaking to an enemy.</p>
        <p>These stealthy skills seem perfect for ''Survivor,'' and the women on the island have done lots of networking and plotting. But the mastermind has been a man, Richard Hatch, a gay corporate consultant who persuaded a homophobic retired Navy Seal to join him and two women in an alliance that gradually voted all the others off the island. And now this odd couple of guys might profit further from female dissension.</p>
        <p>HOW have the men survived? Why have the women fought? I consulted an expert on testosterone, James McBride Dabbs, a social psychologist at Georgia State University and, with his wife, Mary, the author of a new book, ''Heroes, Rogues and Lovers: Testosterone and Behavior'' (McGraw-Hill). He watched last week's episode and was intrigued at the alliance between the gay man and the homophobe.</p>
        <p>''It's not the kind of coalition that women typically form,'' Dr. Dabbs said. ''It's more the ruthless utilitarian coalition men form to do a job, which might be catching an animal or taking over a company or winning a war or developing a new product. It's not personal. It won't last once the job is over. Testosterone helps men focus on the immediate task and neglect the social background and the personal relationships.''</p>
        <p>The men's short-term thinking could be their undoing if the women's memory for personal betrayal comes into play tomorrow night. Or maybe a man will win because ''Survivor,'' while more elaborate than ''Millionaire'' or ''Jeopardy!'' is still just a game.</p>
        <p>''Women are more interested in complex, lasting relationships based on affection rather than getting a one-time task done,'' Dr. Dabbs said. ''That's essential to the broader task of human living, even if it doesn't win a million dollars one night on television.''</p>
