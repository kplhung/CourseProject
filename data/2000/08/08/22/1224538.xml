        <p>Corey Reid was beginning the drudgery of another Monday, ambling across 42nd Street near Fifth Avenue from his day job as a clerk to his night job as a maintenance worker. But Reid's usual scowl disappeared yesterday when he heard about the trade that would have sent Patrick Ewing to Seattle in a four-team deal, one that later collapsed.</p>
        <p>Reid shared the mixed feelings of many Knicks fans who longed for Ewing to bring a championship to the city where he began his professional career. But pulling for the Knicks was not always about pulling for their longtime center.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry it had to be that way -- I would've loved to see him retire a Knick,'' Reid said. ''But he's old and New York needs a winner.''</p>
        <p>Many fans credited the 38-year-old Ewing for his hard play in his 15 years as the centerpiece of the Knicks team. They said they admired his courage as he played through the pain of a wrist injury, bad knees and a stiff back.</p>
        <p>But the injuries that vaulted Ewing's reputation are the same injuries that many said forced the franchise to consider trading him.</p>
        <p>''I always stuck with Ewing,'' said Ken Doran, a police officer, who remembered being ecstatic when the Knicks drafted Ewing in 1985. ''But these last couple of years, with all the injuries, it's just been impossible.''</p>
        <p>When Dumar Chun heard about the possible trade, he stopped in the middle of a crosswalk in Midtown and sighed. ''Ewing was the heart, he was definitely the heart,'' Chun said. ''He was a warrior.''</p>
        <p>Others agreed.</p>
        <p>''He's been here for so long, and he's tried so hard,'' said Charefe Mills, 31, of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>But after all those years, with only two appearances in the National Basketball Association finals, not everyone was so kind toward Ewing.</p>
        <p>''We need someone who is quick and fast on the court, someone who can win us a championship,'' said Angie Villegas, 21, of Flatbush.</p>
        <p>Villegas echoed the sentiments of many fans who had expectant smiles on their faces even as they considered Ewing's possible departure. After years of the Knicks' seemingly bogged-down halfcourt style of play, many fans said they were eager to see a leaner, more athletic team.</p>
        <p>Some fans saw Ewing's career summed up in one play in 1995. With a trip to the Eastern Conference finals on the line in Game 7 against the Indiana Pacers, Ewing, as he often had, called for the ball. He made a strong move and, with the seconds melting away, went to lay in the ball. But his finger roll did not go in as time ran out.</p>
        <p>''It was always that way with him,'' said Ken Adel, 52, a sales manager from New Jersey, who remembers Ewing jumping on tables and pumping his fist in the air before age and injuries hampered his play. ''There was always something missing, a little something extra.''</p>
        <p>Barbara Tedaldi proudly displayed her Teresa Weatherspoon jersey last night as she made her way up the steps to Madison Square Garden to see the Liberty reach the Women's N.B.A. championship round. But with news of the proposed trade, her mind turned to the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''I've seen all my other teams win the championship -- the Mets, the Rangers, the Giants -- but I'm still waiting for the Knicks,'' she said. In fact, Tedaldi said she was more worried about other players being traded.</p>
        <p>''When my son told me, I screamed, 'Please don't let it be Sprewell!' '' said Tedaldi, a season ticket-holder for 15 years, referring to Latrell Sprewell.</p>
        <p>James Stevenson, 36, of Brooklyn agreed with Mills, his friend, that Ewing is a fixture in New York basketball, but he said he wouldn't be sorry to see Ewing go, calling him ''a dinosaur, an old dinosaur.'' Referring to the near trade, he said, ''That's what the Knicks should've done a long time ago.''</p>
        <p>Other fans asked: how many players stay with one team for their entire careers?</p>
        <p>''It's business, that's the bottom line,'' Adel said. ''With the way sports is today, you have to look to the future, and Ewing is part of the past.''</p>
