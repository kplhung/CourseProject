        <p>Even as local governments engage in widespread spraying against virus-bearing mosquitoes, New York's governor yesterday signed what experts called the nation's most stringent notification procedures for the use of pesticides by private companies, schools and individuals.</p>
        <p>The law, signed by Gov. George E. Pataki, promises to affect everyone from the parents of preschool children, who will get written notices 48 hours in advance of pesticide use at day care centers, to fans of weed-free lawns, who could be required to post a notice every time they go to battle with their crab grass.</p>
        <p>The outbreak of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus in the New York region, and concerns about the methods used to battle it, provided a backdrop for the passage of the law, even though this law would not be binding on local governments, legislators and environmentalists said.</p>
        <p>The state is also joining a growing trend of state and local governments across the country that are trying to regulate chemicals by using information.</p>
        <p>The new rules are all based on the idea that knowledge is a right that can be exercised. Residents in Massachusetts and Maryland, for example, can now legally request that their properties not be sprayed for mosquitoes unless a health emergency is declared by local authorities. A Connecticut law that takes effect this fall gives parents the right to join a registry that will give them automatic notices when pesticides are going to be used at their children's schools.</p>
        <p>Chemical companies are using new products and technology to respond to demands for greater knowledge about pesticides, and for greater control over them. Pest-control companies can now tap into databases, for example, that will calculate exactly which homes or buildings will be affected by a given application, and which will not.</p>
        <p>Pesticide experts say advances within the next few years will include computer-controlled spraying mechanisms that use a Global Positioning System so workers will know exactly where the pesticides are being sprayed and what properties are affected. Perhaps just as important in an age of litigation, these systems will give them a written record.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the state's environmental groups, which fought for years to win passage of the New York Neighbor Notification Law, as the new measure is called, said the various compromises required to win passage in the State Legislature made the bill complicated.</p>
        <p>The law covers all manner of chemical pesticides, from those used against insects to garden-variety weed killers. But its effects on the typical suburban lawn are difficult to gauge because the law leaves it up to each county to decide whether to adopt the most stringent provisions, including a requirement that lawn care companies and other commercial pesticide users notify residents in advance of an application in their neighborhood.</p>
        <p>But other parts of the law would affect the entire state, including the requirement that every public school give parents lists of pesticides used on school grounds.</p>
        <p>''The language is complex, but the idea is simple,'' said Audrey Thier, the pesticide project director at Environmental Advocates, a group based in Albany that pushed a notification bill for years. ''When people are aware of what is going on around them and the risks to which they and their children are being subjected, they look for safer alternatives.''</p>
        <p>Some critics of the new wave of legislation say that notification requirements are simply a veiled effort to end pesticide use by making it more and more difficult. They say the new information requirements are simply the means for reaching that goal.</p>
        <p>''At what point does it become unreasonable? -- that's a question I have,'' said Richard J. Pollack, a public health entomologist at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''At some point, you've got to say, O.K., a mosquito control commission is going to need 30 lawyers, and a bunch of geographers, and people to go out and notify people, and in the end, the spray is probably not going to impact people in a significant way anyway.''</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, eight states have passed laws like Connecticut's requiring schools to establish registry systems that give parents the right to be notified in advance if a pesticide is going to be used at their child's school. Two other states require all parents to be notified whether they have asked for the information or not.</p>
        <p>New York's law is a kind of hybrid of those two types. Day care centers, for example, will be required to post notices in advance of applications. At least three times a year, public schools will have to give parents a list of every pesticide used on school grounds. But New York parents will be notified in advance of an application only if they sign up for an information registry.</p>
        <p>Around the country, 11 states have also passed laws in the 1990's requiring local governments to create registry systems for residents to be notified whenever pesticides are going to be used in their areas, by a lawn-care company, for example, according to the National Pest Management Association, which represents mainly pesticide applicators.</p>
        <p>Under New York's law, individual counties can require pesticide users to give 48 hours written notice to properties within 150 feet of an area being treated with a pesticide, although granular pesticides -- which are too large to be carried by the wind -- would be exempted.</p>
        <p>Counties could also require homeowners to post notices on their properties -- just as commercial lawn-care companies do in most places -- whenever a pesticide had been applied. So far, at least five counties around the state, including Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester, have said they would choose the most stringent standard.</p>
        <p>Nassau's bill, sponsored unanimously by all 19 members of the County Legislature, will go to a committee hearing this month and is expected to come up for a full vote in September.</p>
        <p>Because local governments are exempt from the notice requirements, the law would not have any effect on efforts against the mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus, although most counties have been notifying residents in advance about their spraying schedules. But some counties, including Nassau, have taken a further step, passing local laws that make such notices a requirement rather than a courtesy.</p>
