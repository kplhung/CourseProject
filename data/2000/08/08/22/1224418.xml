        <p>With rates of resistance to antibiotics growing in this country, many doctors have long advocated a more measured hand when it comes to dispensing the drugs.</p>
        <p>Now, a new study suggests that when it comes to one of the conditions for which antibiotics are often dispensed -- children's earaches -- the treatment may be of little value.</p>
        <p>A study sponsored by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has found that almost two-thirds of children with acute otitis media, or middle-ear infection, recover from pain and fever within 24 hours of diagnosis -- without antibiotics. And 80 percent recover in one to seven days, the study found.</p>
        <p>Of the children given antibiotics, up to 93 percent recover during the first week.</p>
        <p>The report also found that amoxicillin, long a standard treatment, was about as effective as newer, more expensive antibiotics and caused fewer side effects. And for children 2 and older, there appeared to be no difference between taking a drug for five days or for seven.</p>
        <p>The study was based on a review of studies done of children age 4 weeks to 18 years, from 1964 to 1998.</p>
        <p>About five million episodes of acute otitis media occur in the United States each year and are routinely treated with antibiotics. The report notes that in other countries, like the Netherlands, doctors prefer a method known as ''watchful waiting'' in children over 2. Only if the infection does not clear up in one or two days do they administer an antibiotic.</p>
        <p>The rate of resistance to antibiotics in the Netherlands is about 1 percent. In the United States, it is about 25 percent.</p>
