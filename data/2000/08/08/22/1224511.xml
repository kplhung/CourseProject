        <p>With Ford Explorer owners still crowding car dealerships in search of scarce replacements for recalled Firestone tires, and with sales of new Ford Explorers beginning to slip, the Ford Motor Company said today that it would close three assembly plants for two weeks, beginning next Monday, to make an extra 70,000 tires available.</p>
        <p>Ford will shut down production of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles in St. Louis and of Ford Ranger pickup trucks in St. Paul and Edison, N.J. The Ranger uses the same type of 15-inch tires as many Ford Explorers, although virtually all of the 62 possibly tire-related deaths now under investigation by regulators have occurred in Explorers, which outsell Rangers by a wide margin.</p>
        <p>Martin Inglis, Ford's vice president for North American automotive operations, told reporters in a conference call this afternoon that the factories would reopen on Sept. 11 because a rapid increase in tire production by Bridgestone and other tire makers should ease the current shortage of 15-inch tires by mid-September.</p>
        <p>Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive and president, prepared a television advertisement to be broadcast tonight on ''Monday Night Football'' on ABC, confirming the automaker's decision to cut production and vowing to keep customers' trust.</p>
        <p>Ford idled 6,000 unionized assembly line workers at the three factories. Under Ford's union agreement, the workers draw 95 percent of their usual pay, excluding overtime, during the temporary layoff.</p>
        <p>Ford officials have begun showing signs of panic. The company took out advertisements in national newspapers on Sunday saying that it would channel just 30,000 tires a month to dealerships instead of using them in the production of new Ford vehicles. The decision to close factories, releasing more tires into the market, was made at 1 p.m. today.</p>
        <p>While Ford might be able to catch up some of the production of Rangers later this year, its St. Louis factory constantly runs at full capacity and is unlikely to be able to make up the lost production. Because Ford earns an average pretax profit of $8,000 on each Explorer, that will hurt the company's earnings for the third quarter, financial analysts said.</p>
        <p>''It shows Ford is willing to put customer satisfaction before profitability -- shutting down an auto plant where you make eight grand a unit is a pretty bold statement,'' said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto analyst at Lehman Brothers.</p>
        <p>George Pipas, a Ford market analyst, said that Ford's sales of Explorers had been running at 91 percent of the company's target over the last four days after matching the company's target during the first two weeks of the month. Ford's target had been for a 4 percent increase in Explorer sales compared with those last August, and overall sales of Explorers so far this month are slightly ahead of last year's level, he added.</p>
        <p>Ford is still short of Explorers, having struggled for years to keep up with demand. Closing the factory in St. Louis was not done because of excess inventories, Mr. Pipas said.</p>
        <p>Ford will keep open one of its two Explorer factories, a plant in Louisville, Ky., that tends to make the more expensive models, which are more likely to be equipped with 16-inch tires that have not been recalled. The Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit group sometimes allied with plaintiffs' lawyers, filed a lawsuit against Ford and Bridgestone/ Firestone today, contending that the 16-inch tires should also be recalled, a move that Ford and Bridgestone have repeatedly dismissed as unnecessary. The center also wants a recall of 15-inch tires made at factories whose production is not part of the recall.</p>
        <p>Ford said that it would lose the production of 10,000 Explorers and 15,000 Rangers at the three factories being closed. Mr. Lobaccaro estimated that the loss of the Explorer production would cost Ford up to $80 million in pretax profits during the third quarter, or $52 million in after-tax profits. The lost Ranger production, with a pretax profit of $4,000 apiece, will cost Ford about $60 million in pretax profits and $39 million in after-tax profits in the third quarter, but roughly half of this loss can be recovered in the fourth quarter, he said.</p>
        <p>The lost profits could be smaller if Ford can adjust production in the coming months to emphasize higher-profit versions of the Explorer and Ranger. And all of these sums are small for Ford, which earns $1.2 billion to $2 billion each quarter.</p>
        <p>While Ford executives have consistently said that they are paying attention now only to customer safety, and not to the company's liability exposure, Ford's decision to close the factories temporarily could help its legal position. Plaintiffs' lawyers said last week that people injured in the coming weeks in Ford vehicles equipped with recalled Firestone tires would have strong cases in suing the company as long as Ford continued putting new 15-inch tires on vehicles instead of making them available as replacements.</p>
        <p>Stopping production at the factories for two weeks will only make an extra 70,000 15-inch tires available, at a time when 6.5 million tires are being recalled. While the 25,000 Explorers and Rangers would normally be equipped with 125,000 tires, including spares, not all of the tires would be of the size being recalled. Ford said that it could not adjust its production to make only those Explorers and Rangers that need other sizes of tires.</p>
        <p>A national survey published today by Automotive News, a weekly trade magazine read widely by auto executives, found that 47 percent of the people thought that Ford's honesty had been fair or poor, and 49 percent said that the speed of Ford's response had been fair or poor. Public perception of Bridgestone was considerably worse, while the image of Ford sport utility vehicles other than the Explorer, notably the Expedition, had also eroded, the survey found. The survey was conducted by e-mail by the Dohring Company, a large auto market research firm, with 3,600 respondents who were representative of the country in terms of income and other factors.</p>
        <p>Anne Doyle, a Ford spokeswoman, responded that the survey captured only a temporary reaction to the recall.</p>
        <p>Ford's own focus groups showed that when people viewed Ford's ads, they thought the automaker had handled the issue well.</p>
