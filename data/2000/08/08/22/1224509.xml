        <p>With electricity rates doubling or tripling for some consumers in San Diego, the California Public Utility Commission took a step back from the recent deregulation of the market today and narrowly voted to cap electric bills for some residential and business customers in that city.</p>
        <p>The arrangement, a compromise,  left many people still unhappy, and several experts said further regulations might be needed because of what some have described as price gouging in the wholesale electricity market and a system that leaped toward deregulation before sufficient supplies were available.</p>
        <p>Today's decision, on a vote of 3 to 2, would reduce rates for many residents of San Diego by about 43 percent, assuring that customers who keep their consumption below certain caps would pay no more than $68 a month through the end of the year. San Diego was the first big market in California to be deregulated because its principal gas and electric utilities merged earlier to form Sempra Energy.</p>
        <p>Loretta Lynch, the president of the commission and an opponent of the decision today, explained that the price caps would apply only to individuals who use 500 kilowatts or less a month or from 60 percent to 70 percent of customers in the city. Customers who use more than that will be charged the higher rates in the unregulated market, she said. The decision also applies only to small-business customers, those that use 1,500 kilowatts a month or less.</p>
        <p>San Diego's mayor, Susan Golding, said one of her biggest concerns was that the plan left important users, including public schools and hospitals, at the mercy of a market that has seen prices skyrocket. Ms. Golding said that while she generally favored deregulation, it was ill-considered because the supply was clearly inadequate to meet demand, particularly at a time when the economy was booming.</p>
        <p>''But even if demand weren't so strong, we still would be in incredibly bad shape,'' Ms. Golding said.</p>
        <p>San Diego's utility welcomed today's step as a temporary measure that would be required only until new power plants come into operation, perhaps in three years or so.</p>
        <p>''The impact of deregulation on San Diego has been just awful,'' said Steve Baum, the chairman of Sempra Energy, which owns San Diego Gas and Electric. ''This step as a smoothing mechanism has been very helpful.''</p>
        <p>The deregulation of the $20 billion electrical power industry in the state resulted from passage of a 1996 law. But the state has suffered power shortages that led rolling ''brownouts'' in the San Francisco Bay area in June, in addition to the price increases in San Diego.</p>
        <p>The average wholesale price for San Diego electricity was $117 per megawatt hour, up from $25 per megawatt hour at a comparable time last year, The Associated Press quoted a member of the utilities commission, Carl Wood, as saying.</p>
        <p>This was not the first time that the commission had retreated slightly from its earlier decision to deregulate rates in San Diego, but it was seen as a larger move than in the past. It was also characterized as a possible prelude to more restrictions because of the soaring rates and concerns that inadequate supplies have thwarted this experiment in allowing market forces to determine prices.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lynch said that an investigation was under way into why wholesale rates had soared and that the results of that inquiry might be used to establish other restrictions, at least until significant new supplies of electricity were built.</p>
        <p>Gov. Gray Davis said he supported a competing proposal that would have provided a broader price cap, but which was defeated in a commission vote today.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Davis said, ''the action taken today by the P.U.C. is clearly a step forward.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis, a Democrat, also called for a thorough investigation of the wholesale market by the federal government, and added that he put most of the blame for the problems on price gouging by out-of-state suppliers of electricity.</p>
