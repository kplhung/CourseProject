        <p>Cochlear implants have been used for almost a decade to help thousands of profoundly deaf children, but some two-thirds of insurance companies are often unwilling to pay, citing a lack of evidence that the devices are cost-effective.</p>
        <p>A new study, however, reports that over the course of a deaf person's life, the implants can save more than $50,000 in costs associated with the disability. It also found that the devices, used in children who are not helped by conventional hearing aids, have made a difference in the lives of the children using them.</p>
        <p>''Cochlear implants in profoundly deaf children have a positive effect on quality of life, at reasonable direct costs, and appear to result in a net saving to society,'' researchers at Johns Hopkins University wrote in a recent issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
        <p>The researchers based their conclusions on a study of 78 families of deaf children.</p>
        <p>Although the cost of the implants is well over $10,000, the cost to society of someone who develops profound deafness as a young child is believed to be over $1 million, the report said. The figure includes special education and reduced work productivity.</p>
