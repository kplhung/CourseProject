        <p>Doing hard time at a federal prison in Allenwood, Pa., did not stop two inmates from coming up with a scheme to make a little cash from their fellow convicts, all with the help of a New York City police officer, federal prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>According to an indictment issued in Brooklyn yesterday, the inmates, George Gallego and Hamed Elbarki, told two of their fellow prisoners that they knew a corrupt agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration who could help get them out of prison early. The two arranged for the inmates' families to give thousands of dollars in cash to Mr. Gallego's brother, James, a New York City police officer, the indictment said.</p>
        <p>James Gallego, 34, was arraigned yesterday on charges of wire fraud and mail fraud in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. He was released from custody on $100,000 bail after his lawyer, Robert S. Wolf, denied the charges against him.</p>
        <p>''He had no knowledge of any criminal activity,'' Mr. Wolf said in a courthouse hallway as Mr. Gallego looked on only hours after voluntarily surrendering to the authorities. ''In fact, the purported victims in this case are convicted felons who were seeking to pay bribes to federal agents so they could defraud the United States and get bogus sentence reductions.''</p>
        <p>George Gallego and Mr. Elbarki were still in custody yesterday, but according to the indictment, they told one of their victims last September that Mr. Elbarki's cousin was a dishonest D.E.A. agent who could help the inmate set up a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors. Cooperating with the government would have the effect of vacating a deportation order against the unnamed inmate as well as reducing his sentence, the indictment said.</p>
        <p>To prove themselves, federal prosecutors said, the two men showed their victim a phony document that indicated that George Gallego's 40-year sentence for a murder conspiracy conviction had been cut to only eight years because of the corrupt agent's supposed intervention. But, in fact, the D.E.A. agent did not exist and George Gallego's prison term had been reduced because of an earlier cooperation agreement, the indictment said.</p>
        <p>George Gallego and Mr. Elbarki, who was to be released from Allenwood next month after serving a 56-month sentence for bank robbery, then approached another inmate, the indictment said, and told this man that, for a price, they could introduce him to a lawyer who would put him in touch with the federal drug agent. Federal prosecutors maintain that the lawyer, like the agent, was made up.</p>
        <p>James Gallego, who has been suspended from his job as an officer at the 90th Precinct in Brooklyn, was charged with taking $15,000 in cash from the first inmate's family and $10,000 from the family of the second inmate. Daniel Alonso, an assistant United States attorney, said Mr. Gallego gave some of the money to Mr. Elbarki's family and kept the rest for himself and his brother.</p>
