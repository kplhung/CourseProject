        <p>One bright afternoon last week, at the Prada store on Fifth Avenue, two young women who appeared to share the same parents and the same attitudes about highly elective surgery, passed a baby and platform shoes back and forth between them. With some fall shoes already sold out, they gave up and moved downstairs to the handbag section. ''I have the Chanel, I have the Louis, I have the Gucci,'' said the redhead to the brunette, as a saleswoman showed them a burgundy bowling bag. ''I want tan,'' said the redhead. ''I need tan.''</p>
        <p>The two women seemed to defy the conventional thinking about just who the Fifth Avenue shopper is. First, as locals, they were in full command of the English language, and second, they were spending actual money in a place that displayed not a single Tweety Bird athletic sock.</p>
        <p>While certain New Yorkers continue to lament the downscaling of the stretch of Fifth Avenue from Rockefeller Center to Grand Army Plaza -- its amusement-park feeling, the out-of-towners in their Easy Spirits -- it has become harder to argue that the blocks have been abandoned to the tastes of those eager to dine at Hooters.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 4, Gucci will re-open on Fifth Avenue at 54th Street after an extensive 17-month remodeling, unveiling a new limestone facade, an interior by the architect William Sofield and 13,000 square feet of space in which to sell the label's $800 boots and chevron mink coats. In December, Louis Vuitton will open a 6,000-square-foot store, about the size of its Beverly Hills boutique on Rodeo Drive, one block north of Gucci. Both Bergdorf Goodman and Cartier are in the midst of overhauls. And Saks Fifth Avenue is undergoing a $100 million renovation that will add 40,000 square feet of sales space to the store's flagship, including an expanded fine jewelry section, when complete in 2005.</p>
        <p>What all of this amounts to in the minds of some retailers and shoppers is that Fifth Avenue is reclaiming something of its resplendent past. In a symbolic shift, several months ago the Coca-Cola store on 55th Street -- the first of the avenue's theme stores, which opened in 1992 -- shut its doors for good. Its former space is occupied temporarily by Cartier while it spiffs up its longtime home, three blocks south at 52nd Street. ''It's still a world-renowned shopping destination,'' Pat Malone, the president of Gucci America, said of Fifth Avenue. ''You see the resurgence of luxury brands here.''</p>
        <p>Gucci, long a Fifth Avenue resident, briefly considered joining the luxury exodus to upper Madison Avenue before deciding to stay put. It is the sort of logic with which John Slavinsky, the senior vice president for stores of Louis Vuitton, would not argue. Mr. Slavinsky compared the company's decision to open a store on Fifth Avenue to its decision to move one in Paris from a quiet street to the more clamorous Champs-Elysees two years ago. Sales there increased about 50 percent, Mr. Slavinsky said.</p>
        <p>''In my mind, Madison is where you put a third store,'' Mr. Slavinsky said. (Louis Vuitton put its first New York store in SoHo.) ''We wanted to be in a place with a lot of people.''</p>
        <p>There is speculation in the commercial real-estate world that the Warner Brothers store on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, a mighty symbol of Fifth Avenue as theme park, may move well before the expiration of its lease in five years. The speculation is driven by the fact that the theme-store business has been slackening (Warner has closed four stores in 18 months) and that the building housing its nine-story emporium was purchased in March by Allied Partners, a development firm. A representative of Allied, which could theoretically buy out the Warner Brothers lease, would not comment. A spokeswoman for Warner Brothers, when asked if there were plans to close the store, said, ''Not that I'm aware of.''</p>
        <p>For some, Fifth Avenue started its descent toward lowbrow well before the theme stores ever arrived -- back in the late 1960's, 70's and 80's, when discreet stores like De Pinna and Peck &amp; Peck stopped selling their establishment tweeds. Peck &amp; Peck had opened on Fifth Avenue and 48th Street in 1907, pioneering upscale retailers' shift from the East 20's and 30's to what was then considered ''upper'' Fifth.</p>
        <p>Beginning in the 90's, with the arrival of Barneys New York on the Upper East Side, the focus shifted again, this time to Madison Avenue above 61st Street, where rents in recent years have caught up to what they are on Fifth, about $600 a square foot, said Faith Hope Consolo, the vice chairwoman of Garrick-Aug Worldwide, a real-estate consulting company. The renewed interest in Fifth, Ms. Consolo said, has much to do with a heightened understanding among retailers of the modern shopper's habits, whether she is from Westport, Conn., or Dusseldorf. ''There's no pure luxury anymore,'' Ms. Consolo said. ''There's no pure shopper.''</p>
        <p>''Someone who shops at Chanel also shops at H&amp;M,'' she said, referring to the inexpensive Swedish clothier drawing crowds on Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>Ms. Consolo, who bids on store spaces for retail clients, makes it her business to know how well purveyors of expensive clothes do once they land on Fifth. The Prada store between 56th and 57th Streets on Fifth achieves sales four times greater per square foot than at Prada's Madison Avenue store, Ms. Consolo said. She said that when the men's clothier Ermenegildo Zegna opened on Fifth near 57th, it increased its wholesale business by about 70 percent.</p>
        <p>In the view of Tom Cusick, the president of the Fifth Avenue Association, ''the whole notion that Fifth turned down a mass path is  overblown.'' As head of the association, a group of merchants and property owners, Mr. Cusick wouldn't be expected to say otherwise; but he does point out that while many spent the 90's whining about the end of a recherche Fifth Avenue, the decade saw the arrival of a fair number of high-end stores. Prada replaced a Doubleday bookstore on Fifth. Fendi took the place of a Hallmark card store.</p>
        <p>Giulia Melucci, a publicist at Scribner, who was walking up Fifth not long ago, felt  that merchants like the National Basketball Association had been gaining on the avenue until recently. ''I walked past H&amp;M,'' she said, ''and I saw that big sign announcing a new Louis Vuitton across the street and I thought, 'What does it all mean?' It means that Fifth is a democracy, not purely elite, not purely crass.''</p>
