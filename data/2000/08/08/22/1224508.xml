        <p>For those without moral qualms, it has to be one of the last remaining bargains in New York State: Chop down a tree worth hundreds, even thousands, of dollars and -- if caught -- pay a paltry $10 fine.</p>
        <p>Since 1909, that has been the minimum penalty for each tree taken illegally from pristine state forests in the Adirondacks and the Catskills, even though law enforcement officials can ask for up to three times the estimated value of those trees. But in many cases, these officials say, tree rustlers escape without paying anything at all because it is difficult to catch them and the $10 penalty poses little, if any, deterrent.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people don't speed on state roads because they don't want to get hit with a heavy fine,'' said Judith Enck, an adviser for State Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, whose office prosecutes a half-dozen cases of timber theft a year from public and private lands. ''This is the equivalent of getting hit with a 7 cents fine if you're caught speeding. So they're just going to eat that fine.''</p>
        <p>State officials, environmentalists and others renewed their calls today for heavier penalties and other measures to stop timber theft, during a hearing held by state legislators in Jamestown, a small city south of Buffalo. It was the second of three hearings that will be held.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the Democratic-led Assembly has passed several bills that included stiffer penalties for stealing timber from protected state forest land, but the Republican-led Senate and the timber industry have opposed those bills because of other provisions in them. But several legislators and environmentalists said today that they were hopeful  those differences could be resolved by next year's legislative session, which starts in January.</p>
        <p>''We don't have a problem with the increase,'' said Thomas Bergin, a spokesman for Senator Ronald B. Stafford, a Republican from Plattsburgh who has introduced a bill that would increase the penalty to $350 per tree. ''If it was simply a matter of dealing with timber theft, we'd have a bill today. Unfortunately, the Assembly attaches other items to it that are, at best, only peripherally related.''</p>
        <p>Although no one knows for sure how often trees are filched from public land, state officials and environmentalists say that it has become a growing problem as the market value for hardwoods like black cherry and chestnut has risen to $1,000 or more per tree. Dan Farrell, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Conservation, estimated that trees are illegally taken each year from about 100 acres of the 4 million acres of state-owned forest land.</p>
        <p>Kevin S. King, executive vice president of the Empire State Forest Products Association, said that timber theft had also cut into the income of private landowners and businesses in the state's $4-billion-a-year timber industry. There is no specific penalty for stealing trees from private land. ''Individually, it can have a significant impact,'' he said. ''You lose a few trees, and that's a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>But environmentalists have warned that the damage to forests and wildlife habitats in the Adirondacks and Catskills goes far beyond money. ''In the course of stealing 5 or 10 trees, they've damaged 30 trees,'' said John F. Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, an advocacy and protection group. ''Yet, with 5 or 10 trees, you barely have a $100 fine. It's like spitting on the sidewalk. In a lot of smaller cases, there has been very little effort to bring these people to justice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sheehan said the higher prices for hardwoods had increasingly led to a different type of timber thief who is harder to catch than in the past: renegades who deliberately chop down a handful of choice trees, rather than loggers for lumber or paper companies that mistakenly stray across their boundaries.</p>
        <p>''It's more of a middle-of-the-night thing,'' he said. ''People are being very selective about stealing extremely high-value trees.''</p>
