        <p>Shares of the Boots Company P.L.C., a British drug and beauty retailer, rose 3 percent, to 516 pence, on a report in The Independent on Sunday, a British newspaper, that the company may be purchased for $9 billion by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the expansion-minded American retailing giant. Analysts said it was hard to see the rationale for such a deal as the two companies pursue markedly different business strategies. Wal-Mart concentrates on large out-of-town retail sites, while Boots' stores are smaller and placed in most of Britain's main urban shopping districts. Both companies declined to comment.</p>
