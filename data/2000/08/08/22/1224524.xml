        <p>Dave Thomas streaked up the left sideline, intercepted a short pass from Kerry Collins and broke toward the end zone before the play ended. It was merely a preseason practice outside Giants Stadium, but Thomas needs some positive reinforcement after the cornerback's poor performance Friday against the Jets, and provided that for himself with the play he made against his team's starting quarterback.</p>
        <p>Jason Sehorn, the veteran cornerback on the other side of the field, jogged over to Thomas and offered a high-five. Still, Thomas insists he doesn't need special treatment.</p>
        <p>''My skin is like an armadillo and a rhinoceros,'' Thomas said afterward. ''It's very thick. It's pretty much over with.''</p>
        <p>Thomas preferred to look at Friday night as the exception, not a prelude. For one night, though, it was worrisome. With the Giants' defense unable to pressure Ray Lucas, the second-team quarterback, he had ample time to find an open receiver. Usually, Lucas was looking Thomas's way, and when he threw there, he was successful. Lucas completed 19 of 26 passes for 286 yards and 3 touchdowns, including a flea-flicker in which Thomas was one of three Giants defensive backs who was fooled on the run fake.</p>
        <p>Thomas said today that he was still learning the Giants' defense, the third he will have played under in three years, and that he hadn't yet adjusted to where help would come from the safeties. Thomas noted that the Giants added two new defenses. And despite all the looks Lucas gave him, Thomas said he didn't think the Jets were coming after him.</p>
        <p>''I don't get that feeling,'' Thomas said, while adding: ''I encourage that. It's more to prove for me.''</p>
        <p>But Coach Jim Fassel said, ''It was obvious there were times they went after him.''</p>
        <p>Despite the interception in practice today, Thomas was also beaten several times by Collins while covering wide receiver Amani Toomer.</p>
        <p>Fassel expressed optimism in both the pass rush and Thomas, and he truly has few alternatives in either regard.</p>
        <p>After being signed as a free agent from Jacksonville for the league minimum of $440,000 plus incentives, Thomas was expected to play in nickel-back situations. But Conrad Hamilton's continued knee problems forced his release before training camp and thrust Thomas into a starting role, leaving Emmanuel McDaniel as the nickel back.</p>
        <p>Fassel said today that he expected Thomas to be the starting cornerback when the Giants open the season Sept. 3 against Arizona.</p>
        <p>Thomas has good size, at 6 feet 3 inches, but has continually faced criticism that he is too slow to keep up with fast receivers. Thomas started 35 games at cornerback for the Jaguars, but none since 1998. Injuries cost him his starting job that season, and he was used primarily in nickel and dime situations and on special teams last season.</p>
        <p>Sehorn, one of the National Football League's top defensive backs before injuries limited him the past two seasons, is a lock to start at one cornerback. The Giants' lack of depth may provide Thomas a safety net.</p>
        <p>''I'm concerned about how thin we are, and I want Dave Thomas to be a confident guy and play confidently,'' Fassel said. ''You can't be out on the corners and not be confident. And I think he is.''</p>
        <p>Thomas promised an improved effort from himself and the team this Friday in the Giants' final preseason game, against the Baltimore Ravens.</p>
        <p>''I think this game is going to show a big difference,'' Thomas said. ''It's going to show how hungry we are, how bad we want to show how much of a team we can be and pull together with adversity.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>JOE MONTGOMERY is in no-man's land, with little chance of stealing carries from TIKI BARBER and RON DAYNE and little experience at fullback. Montgomery carried once for 1 yard against the Jets and is playing fullback for the first time. Montgomery, the Giants' leading rusher last season, maintained he was in competition with Dayne, the first-round pick. Yet Montgomery isn't getting the chance to compete. ''I don't think I have to show those guys something,'' he said. ''They know what happened last year. Going out there and playing with broken ribs, going out there when they put me on the field, I produced.'' . . . A second opinion on running back SEAN BENNETT'S knee Monday confirmed Giants doctors' diagnosis that Bennett needs season-ending surgery. He will have the operation within the next 10 days, the team said. The Giants haven't said more than Bennett has at least a strained medial collateral ligament.</p>
