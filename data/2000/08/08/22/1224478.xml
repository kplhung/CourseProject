        <p>To understand the genius of Tiger Woods, you must appreciate not only his skill, but also his will.</p>
        <p>Like truly great athletes in any sport, Woods possesses something deep within that allows him to focus clearly in the most chaotic and challenging situations. Those who watched Woods and Bob May battle Sunday during the final round of the P.G.A. Championship saw a classic moment in sports. It was like watching Muhammad Ali versus Joe Frazier at the Thrilla in Manila, like watching Michael Jordan's last game, against the Utah Jazz, in which he ended his career with a textbook jump shot that clinched another championship.</p>

        <p>To understand the genius of Tiger Woods, you must appreciate not only his skill, but also his will.</p>
        <p>Like truly great athletes in any sport, Woods possesses something deep within that allows him to focus clearly in the most chaotic and challenging situations. Those who watched Woods and Bob May battle Sunday during the final round of the P.G.A. Championship saw a classic moment in sports. It was like watching Muhammad Ali versus Joe Frazier at the Thrilla in Manila, like watching Michael Jordan's last game, against the Utah Jazz, in which he ended his career with a textbook jump shot that clinched another championship.</p>
        <p>During Sunday's finishing holes, Woods's putting stroke under pressure was as pure as Jordan's shooting stroke at the buzzer. Woods faced two difficult putts that he simply could not afford to miss -- the 15-footer to save par at No. 15 in regulation and the 5-footer for birdie at No. 18 to force the playoff.</p>
        <p>Was anyone surprised that Woods sank them both? Was anyone surprised when Woods opened the playoff with another birdie putt, chasing the ball into the hole like a jockey riding a horse down the backstretch? Those putts reflected another quality shared by Woods and Jack Nicklaus. Both are good putters. But in pressure situations, they become great putters.</p>
        <p>''It was a great battle, and I enjoyed it,'' Woods said afterward. ''You learn something about yourself in situations like that.''</p>
        <p>But instead of learning something, Woods actually reinforced something he already knew. Not only is he the world's most talented player, but he may be the toughest mentally.</p>
        <p>Woods is 5-0 in majors when he leads entering the final round. There were people who actually wondered how Woods would react if he were challenged during the back nine of a major championship. After all, he had run away with both the United States Open and the British Open, turning the final holes into a victory lap. Would Woods crack if someone finally pushed him to the final hole and played against him without fear?</p>
        <p>The answer came Sunday. May played remarkably well, and his performance was more impressive when you consider that he had never been in that situation before. One could argue that he would have beaten any other player in the world except Woods. On the back nine, May turned in the performance of his life, shooting a five-under-par 31. All weekend, May played the tournament of his life, shooting 66 in each of the final three rounds.</p>
        <p>No, May was not perfect, and his missed 4-foot birdie putt at No. 15 was huge. But he played well enough to force Woods to make a 5-footer on No. 18 just to force a playoff. Who expected that when the day started? Yet, May still lost because Woods simply would not let anyone else win.</p>
        <p>''When you shoot 66 in the final three rounds of a major, you're supposed to win,'' May said. ''But it wasn't good enough to beat Tiger.''</p>
        <p>When Woods blitzed the field at both the United States Open and the British Open this year, it was a tribute to his talent and his preparation. When Woods won Sunday, it was a tribute to his grit. He never came close to hitting the ball as well here as he did during his romps at Pebble Beach and St. Andrews. For most of the P.G.A., his putting was erratic.</p>
        <p>From the moment May went two strokes up on Sunday, however, Woods became a different player. When he senses a tournament slipping away, Woods truly becomes a tiger. That was true during his amateur days, when he won three consecutive United States Amateur championships, and it remains true today. Competition does not scare Woods, it inspires him. And when May opened the door by missing his crucial 4-foot birdie attempt at No. 15, Woods sensed an opening and seized it.</p>
        <p>So Woods added to his lore, becoming the first player to win four out of five majors, and only the second to win three professional majors in one year, matching Ben Hogan's feat from 1953. And by dueling into a playoff, Woods and May made the P.G.A. Championship the most dramatic of the year's four majors.</p>
        <p>Watching Woods dominate at Pebble Beach and St. Andrews was compelling in its own right because nobody had ever seen anything quite like it. But at those two events, it became obvious that Woods would win. There was not the heart-pounding excitement that Sunday's final round contained, when people were afraid to turn away, fearful they might miss a dramatic shot.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere at Valhalla Golf Club was electric, with people in the gallery screaming for both players. Television viewers tuned in and could not turn it off. It was another great moment for golf, and once again, Woods was the focal point. And with Woods still only 24 years old, there should be many great moments to come.</p>
        <p>Whatever he does the rest of year is gravy. The majors are over, and there is no doubt who will win the money title or the Player of the Year award. For Woods, the next great achievement could come next year at Augusta, where he will try to win the Masters and become the first player to win four consecutive professional majors, the consecutive Grand Slam, if you will.</p>
        <p>Until then, it would be wise to appreciate what Woods has done over the past 12 months. Even he may never enjoy another run like that. And by finding a way to win Sunday, Woods proved again that both his skill and his will are enormous.</p>
