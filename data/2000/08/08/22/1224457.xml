        <p>Only weeks before shareholders vote on a planned merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges, British and German regulators said today that the two bourses had not yet devised adequate rules to guarantee the financial transparency of what would be Europe's dominant transnational stock market by far.</p>
        <p>The unusual joint comment by the Financial Services Authority of Britain and the Federal Securities Trading Security Authority of Germany seemed to add to the questions piling up around the merger, according to British traders who had already questioned the regulatory, clearing and settlement framework of the proposed new exchange. Many of them have been skeptical since reading the initial agreement, which was vaguely worded.</p>
        <p>''It's a preliminary document saying here are some of the issues which we need to work out,'' said Brian Mairs, a spokesman for the Association of Private Client Stock Brokers and Investment Managers, the representative body of British private client brokers, who control about one-third of the shares in the London Stock Exchange. ''It's evidently not enough to sort out all the issues.''</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Mairs said, some assurances from regulators were encouraging. ''The more transparency the better; we're very pleased,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The London shareholders are to vote Sept. 14 on the merger. Approval needs a 75 percent majority.</p>
        <p>In their document today, the British and German supervisory authorities singled out the marked differences in both the legal and practical approaches to disclosure on the London and Frankfurt exchanges, which mean, for instance, that start-ups in Germany face different listing requirements on the Neue Markt there than on the Alternative Investment Market in Britain. Additionally, most large trades in Britain must be reported to the exchange immediately, while many large trades in Frankfurt are not subject to the same requirement, according to British traders.</p>
        <p>The British and German regulators said, however, in the merged exchange, all trades would be reported to both regulators.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the proposed merger, London would handle mostly blue-chip transactions while start-ups and stocks of high-growth companies would be concentrated in Frankfurt.</p>
        <p>''The authorities note that the legal and regulatory requirements governing the scope and level of their transparency arrangements need further consideration in consultation with market participants,'' the document said.</p>
        <p>It was the first time the regulators had commented publicly on the planned merger, announced last May. The merger is part of a Europe-wide scramble for alliances as traditional exchanges are challenged both by Internet-based electronic trading systems and by investors' demands for a single bourse that reflects the growing perception of Europe as a single market. The new, merged exchange is to be called iX, for international exchange, with corporate headquarters in London.</p>
        <p>The regulators' statement said: ''The development of iX needs to take full account of requirements of market integrity -- in particular the prevention of insider dealing and market abuse -- and of market transparency and the protection of investors.''</p>
        <p>Howard Davies, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, also said the ''overriding objective'' of British and German regulators was ''to ensure that iX's proposals take full account of our requirements for market integrity, investor protection and the prevention of market abuse.''</p>
        <p>Don Cruickshank, the chairman of the London Stock Exchange and chairman-designate of iX, called the regulators' document ''an important step'' toward common regulatory practices. He did not respond in detail to the regulators' concerns. He insisted, however, that the Sept. 14 vote would not be delayed.</p>
        <p>The combined exchange would far outstrip other European exchanges, with a combined market value of $4.3 trillion, making it the world's fourth largest after the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the Tokyo stock exchange. There are plans for a separate European transnational exchange, called Euronext, that would group the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels bourses, trading stocks with a market value of about $2.2 trillion.</p>
