        <p>At a time when many critics and classical music lovers fret that orchestras around the world are becoming stylistically homogenized, the Russian conductor Valery Gergiev has been a tireless proselytizer for the distinctiveness of the orchestra of the Kirov Opera and Ballet, of which he is the artistic director. Of course informed musicians anywhere can learn to play Russian repertory sensitively. But hearing Russian musicians and singers perform operas that they have absorbed from long tradition and constant renewal can be a revelation.</p>
        <p>For the last few seasons at the Salzburg Festival, Mr. Gergiev has been agitating to get Russian operas performed here. When Gerard Mortier, the festival's artistic director, who in the face of opposition has broadened its cultural reach, presented Weill's ''Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny'' in the summer of 1998, that was the last straw for Mr. Gergiev.</p>
        <p>''I told him, 'Gerard, I'm sorry, but Tchaikovsky is a more important composer than Kurt Weill,' '' Mr. Gergiev said during a panel discussion. Whether or nor Mr. Mortier agreed, it worked. On Wednesday night at the Large Festival Hall, the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theater, as the Kirov is known in St. Petersburg, made its festival debut, conducted by Mr. Gergiev in a concert performance of Tchaikovsky's ''Pique Dame,'' or ''The Queen of Spades,'' based on the Pushkin story. The glittery Salzburg audience responded ecstatically.</p>
        <p>The cast was Russian with one notable exception: Placido Domingo, celebrating his 25th anniversary at the festival. He sang the lead role of Hermann, a tormented and avaricious army officer in St. Petersburg in the early 1790's who professes love for Lisa, a vulnerable young woman of means, but is fatally obsessed with finding out the purported secret to winning at cards from a bitter old countess, the Queen of Spades of the title.</p>
        <p>Mr. Domingo first performed the role, his first in Russian, this past season at the Metropolitan Opera with Mr. Gergiev conducting. One could argue that the Met Orchestra played the score with more technical precision and suppleness. But the performance here by the Kirov Orchestra was striking for the distinctive character and colors the players revealed in the music.</p>
        <p>The string sound was rich yet touchingly plaintive, even during lighthearted passages. When playing pianissimo, the woodwinds had a reedy sound that seemed to emanate from some far-off place. The brass were not afraid to be raucous, but the effect was weighty and virile, never rude and boisterous. Apparently Mr. Gergiev, jetting about to other engagements, missed part of his rehearsals for this program and another with the Vienna Philharmonic, which may feed the perception that he is accepts too many dates and doesn't especially like rehearsing.</p>
        <p>He relies a lot on inspiring players with his spontaneity and charisma. It worked on this occasion. He is a musician with powerful instincts and an uncanny ear, and he has a palpable connection to this repertory.</p>
        <p>It goes without saying that the fine Russian singers brought stylistic authority to their work, especially Larissa Diadkova as the Countess, Nikolai Putilin as Count Tomsky, Vladimir Moroz as Prince Yeletsky and, despite some vocal stridency, the Kirov prima donna Galina Gorchakova as Lisa.</p>
        <p>The role of Hermann is sometimes called the Russian Otello. Mr. Domingo infused it with the impassioned lyricism and declamatory power that he has long been noted for in the Italian Otello. Yet he knows when to hold back and to pace himself. For a singer pushing 60, his Hermann is a remarkable accomplishment.</p>
        <p>Answering a question at the panel, Mr. Gergiev confirmed that to accommodate Mr. Domingo's current difficulties with sustained high-range singing, some passages in the ''Pique Dame'' score were performed in slightly lowered transpositions. But he defended the artistic propriety of these adjustments, asserting that Tchaikovsky sanctioned similar changes for his own singers, adding that if Placido Domingo had not undertaken this role, it ''would have been a great loss to world culture.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday morning Mr. Gergiev conducted a program of Russian works with the Vienna Philharmonic at the Large Festival Hall, proving that even Austrian orchestras can sound rather Russian when he conducts them. By choosing some startlingly measured tempos and highlighting curious inner voices in Prokofiev's ''Classical'' Symphony, he made this well-known work, treated by many conductors as a clever trifle, seem newly complex and inventive.</p>
        <p>Alfred Schnittke's 1985 Concerto for Viola and Orchestra, despite its sometimes just plain odd mix of musical styles, received a riveting performance with the amazing Yuri Bashmet as soloist. Mr. Gergiev concluded with an organic and blazing performance of Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' that routinely ignored the composer's metronome markings. Could anyone have cared? The music never seemed more radical. And Russian.</p>
        <p>Saturday night at the Large Festival Hall brought a chance to attend Salzburg's ill-fated production of Wagner's tale of ill-fated lovers, ''Tristan und Isolde.'' The scheduled conductor, Claudio Abbado, had withdrawn during the winter because of illness and was replaced by Lorin Maazel. Then, two weeks before the first performance, the world's newly proclaimed Tristan, the tenor Ben Heppner, pulled out for personal reasons. Apparently, festival organizers said, he could not face another string of performances of this daunting heroic tenor role. Jon Fredric West valiantly stepped in.</p>
        <p>The production by Klaus Michael Gruber, introduced at the Salzburg Easter Festival last year, is static, stylistically inconsistent, ultimately conventional and poorly lighted. Still, the Vienna Philharmonic is quite the pit band for ''Tristan,'' and though Mr. Maazel had no special interpretive insights, the orchestra sounded luminous.</p>
        <p>These days the voice of the soprano Waltraud Meier, a veteran Isolde, is not the most attractive, especially at the top. But she is a keenly intelligent and interesting artist who infused her portrayal with subtlety and temperament.</p>
        <p>Mr. West, once a belter, has brought more pliancy to his singing in recent years. His beefy voice got a little leathery at times. But he has the stamina for the role, which few tenors do, and a sense of the poetry. The baritone Falk Struckmann was a stalwart Kurwenal; the bass Matti Salminen was a stentorian King Marke; the mezzo-soprano Marjana Lipovsek, though vocally shaky, was a moving Brangane.</p>
        <p>The Salzburg Festival has tended to cede Wagner to Bayreuth. This performance at least suggested that there are good reasons, especially the Vienna Philharmonic, to present the operas here from time to time.</p>
