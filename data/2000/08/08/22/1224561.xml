        <p>In the mad-dash opening minutes of last night's Eastern Conference finals, the Liberty played as if there were only a tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The present passed in a blur, as Liberty players steamrolled the visiting Cleveland Rockers in the first half, turning them into wide-eyed tourists unnerved by the rush of bodies, bright lights and brash sounds in Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>The Liberty launched a 30-2 run from the opening tap and held the Rockers scoreless for 10 minutes in the first half, which was nearly a repeat of what happened in Sunday's Game 2.</p>
        <p>But then, in another nightmarish repeat of Game 2 for the Liberty, the Rockers recovered in the second half, closing within 10 points with just under three minutes remaining in the game and introducing doubt into what had been total domination.</p>
        <p>The Liberty players have used doubt as a weapon this year, and in the final minutes once again turned back Cleveland to send the confetti showering onto the Garden floor, draping an exhaustive but eventually convincing 81-67 victory over the Rockers.</p>
        <p>For the second straight year, the Liberty captured the Eastern Conference championship.</p>
        <p>''We're proud of ourselves because of what we had to go through with nobody believing in us, and here we are again,'' the team captain, Teresa Weatherspoon, said. ''We're happy with what we accomplished, but we haven't accomplished anything yet.''</p>
        <p>For the third time in the four-year history of the Women's National Basketball Association, the Liberty earned a trip to the finals, to play the league's only champions, the Houston Comets.</p>
        <p>The two-of-three-game series opens Thursday night in the Garden, where the Liberty has won 13 straight games, then shifts to Houston over the weekend.</p>
        <p>''When it got down to 10 points, I was a little bit nervous,'' said Liberty center Tari Phillips, who scored all 12 of her points in her team's remarkable 46-point first half. ''But I already said before the game, that was not our destiny. This is what we fought for all season long; this is why we had 13 wins against great teams at home, including Houston. We were going to take this win no matter what.''</p>
        <p>Last night, the Liberty played like a veteran team, using its home-court advantage and experience to befuddle the much younger Cleveland group, which could not overcome the Liberty's merciless defense. The Rockers rode to the end the 13-point effort of Suzie McConnell Serio, their 35-year-old veteran point guard, who is now officially retired.</p>
        <p>It was her 3-pointer, her third of the game, that put the Rockers within 10 points with 2 minutes 45 seconds remaining. ''We lost our concentration,'' the Liberty's Becky Hammon said. ''We just had to keep together. We just couldn't play not to lose.''</p>
        <p>And with that, Hammon, the second-year shooting guard, scored 6 straight points three ways -- off foul shots, a 12-foot jumper and a driving layup. That gave the Liberty a 14-point lead and sealed the victory before a crowd of 15,173, which included Nets guard Stephon Marbury, who celebrated with the team on the court.</p>
        <p>Forward Tamika Whitmore, also a second-year player for the Liberty, scored a game-high 19 points. ''Last year I came in and I didn't know what to expect,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Last night, she was so prepared, she was unable to meditate as usual, restless for the victory. ''This one feels better,'' Whitmore added about the Eastern Conference title. ''It feels better because a lot of people doubted us in the beginning, and we still became champs.''</p>
        <p>There was doubt after the Liberty dropped the first game of this two-of-three series in Cleveland. There was doubt Sunday when the Liberty allowed the Rockers to creep back into the game. But from the start of last night's game, the Liberty made sure there was no question who was in control.</p>
        <p>Signs in large type displaying confident quotes from the Rockers hung on top of diagrammed plays in the Liberty locker room before the game, as much motivation as New York would need.</p>
        <p>In the first half, New York shot 55.9 percent from the floor, outrebounded Cleveland, 17-12, and with 8:49 to play in the half, New York already had a 33-5 lead.</p>
        <p>''I think the first half they were very emotional, just like yesterday,'' said Cleveland's Merlakia Jones. ''We were taking quick shots and they were taking advantage of it. You're just trying to find some kind of a way to stop the bleeding.''</p>
        <p>When Hammon's desperation underhand floater found its way into the basket at the buzzer to end the half, it was an omen, if not a precursor to the end. New York led, 46-27.</p>
        <p>''We could have hung our heads, but we didn't,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>Cleveland first closed the deficit to 13 points in the opening minutes of the second half, but then the Liberty launched an 8-0 run that seemed to put the game out of reach.</p>
        <p>Vickie Johnson, playing on a right ankle she sprained in Game 2, scored 14 points, and had 10 assists and 6 rebounds, an emblem for a team that would not be denied.</p>
        <p>''Before the game, it was probably like 70 percent, but I told Coach that once I warmed up it will be 110 percent,'' she said. ''It's really sore. I turned it three times, but thought I can't dwell on that -- I couldn't let my team down.''</p>
        <p>Johnson scored 14 points.</p>
        <p>''We had tremendous passion tonight to win the Eastern Conference championship,'' Coach Richie Adubato said. ''That's why we focused on such a great start in every phase of the game. We were everywhere, we got rebounds, pushed the ball and made great decisions.''</p>
        <p>The Rockers, meanwhile, made poor decisions, rushing shots. They won only four road games this season, their last coming three weeks ago. While the Liberty has been adequate on the road, 9-9, the team has been virtually unbeatable in the Garden, with a 15-4 record.</p>
        <p>The Liberty has not lost in the Garden since June 25, including a 69-64 victory over Houston.</p>
        <p>''To beat Houston we have to do everything right,'' Whitmore said. ''We can't have any slip-ups. When you go into the final we can't have any mental lapses like we did tonight.''</p>
        <p>Just frantic runs, followed by confetti.</p>
