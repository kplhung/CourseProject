        <p>Teenagers said they would be likely to switch from one brand or retailer to one that supports a good cause -- if price and quality were equal -- according to the second annual Cone/Roper Cause-Related Teen Survey. The study was commissioned by Cone Inc. in Boston, a division of the Omnicom Group, and conducted by Roper Starch Worldwide in New York.</p>
        <p>Eighty-nine percent of the respondents to the survey, which was completed in online interviews from Aug. 3 to Aug. 9, said they would be likely to switch brands to one that supported a good cause, if price and quality were equal. Likewise, 85 percent of the respondents said they would be likely to switch retailers to one associated with a good cause, if price and quality are equal. The survey was conducted with 600 America Online users aged 12 to 17.</p>

        <p>Given a list of eight factors that could be considered when making a purchase, the youths said, making donations to causes and support of causes ranked behind the quality of the product but ahead of factors like price, advertising and celebrity endorsement.</p>
        <p>The survey found that the most popular ways to find out about a company's social commitments were television advertisements, followed by school and then newspaper or magazine ads.</p>
