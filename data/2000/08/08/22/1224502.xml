        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton's appearance at a community center here ended abruptly this afternoon when a woman in the audience inadvertently discharged a pepper-gas canister in her purse, sending people, many of them coughing, out of the building.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was posing for pictures with children and taking questions at the Nepperhan Community Center when the room broke out in a wave of coughs.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's Secret Service contingent walked over and escorted Mrs. Clinton outside to  fresh air, and there she continued to shake hands, give autographs and pose for photographs. Her aides said she was not affected by the release of the gas, but she left ahead of schedule to make way for fire trucks called to investigate the release of the pepper gas.</p>
        <p>The pepper gas canister was inadvertently set off by Ka'ttie Coleman, a Democratic district leader, who was seated in a wheelchair about 50 feet from where Mrs. Clinton was speaking. Mrs. Coleman, who was questioned by Secret Service agents, said that she had placed an organizer into her purse, which had set off the pepper gas canister.</p>
        <p>''I worked very hard for her party,'' Mrs. Coleman said, obviously distressed by the evacuation.</p>
