        <p>The crowd started hooting on Dennis Cook's first ball to Dave Magadan with the bases loaded in the bottom of the 10th tonight. The hoots became roars when ball two sailed by. In his second inning of work, Cook had already walked four hitters. The unpredictable Mets left-hander was about to unravel again.</p>
        <p>Cook got a called strike, then a fastball came in a little low. Cook smirked -- he felt his strike zone had been squeezed by the home plate umpire, Gerry Davis, in the ninth -- and his final pitch was at Magadan's shoe tops. It was ball four, and it forced in the winning run as the Padres beat the Mets, 5-4.</p>

        <p>The crowd started hooting on Dennis Cook's first ball to Dave Magadan with the bases loaded in the bottom of the 10th tonight. The hoots became roars when ball two sailed by. In his second inning of work, Cook had already walked four hitters. The unpredictable Mets left-hander was about to unravel again.</p>
        <p>Cook got a called strike, then a fastball came in a little low. Cook smirked -- he felt his strike zone had been squeezed by the home plate umpire, Gerry Davis, in the ninth -- and his final pitch was at Magadan's shoe tops. It was ball four, and it forced in the winning run as the Padres beat the Mets, 5-4.</p>
        <p>Cook (6-3) stalked off the mound, hollering at Davis and holding his hands close together, giving his representation of Davis's strike zone. Cook shook his head and glanced once more toward Davis before slipping into the dugout.</p>
        <p>The loss dropped the Mets two and a half games behind Atlanta in the National League East, but they retained their three-and-a-half-game lead over Arizona in the wild-card race. Trevor Hoffman (4-4) was the winner for San Diego in relief of Woody Williams, who pitched nine innings but lost a 4-0 lead.</p>
        <p>The Padres got out of the top of the ninth when Derek Bell of the Mets was called out for interfering with Padres catcher Wiki Gonzalez, who was trying to catch Darryl Hamilton stealing. Manager Bobby Valentine argued unsuccessfully with Davis, and Cook came in to pitch.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez led off the ninth with a smash to right-center, and Jay Payton -- who is fast enough and takes good enough reads to play shallow -- dashed back to the warning track to take away an extra-base hit. But pinch-hitter Joe Vitiello walked, and pinch-runner Damian Jackson stole second. With two outs and runners at first and second, Cook fanned Ryan Klesko on a sidearm slider to end the inning.</p>
        <p>But Cook opened the 10th with a walk to Phil Nevin. Ruben Rivera reached on a fielder's choice, and a single by Mike Darr and a walk to Gonzalez loaded the bases for the pinch-hitter Magadan.</p>
        <p>Glendon Rusch's outing had long since ended by then, but his perseverance allowed the Mets to use their bullpen later rather than sooner.</p>
        <p>Ten times in Rusch's first 13 starts this year, he pitched at least six innings and allowed no more than three earned runs. For only the fourth time in 10 starts, Rusch matched that criteria, and the Mets needed it.</p>
        <p>Rusch had to give the Mets innings; the bullpen worked four and a third innings Sunday, and the long reliever Pat Mahomes is starting Tuesday for Mike Hampton, who is being held back because of a stress fracture in his right ribs, which forced him from his start last Thursday. Hampton will probably need to throw two bullpen sessions before he can start again, and the Mets are not sure when that will be.</p>
        <p>The Padres jumped to a 4-0 lead tonight, partly because of sloppy defense but also because they wore down a control pitcher. With two outs and the bases empty in the first, Klesko fouled off four pitches with a 3-2 count. Rusch, who averages only two walks per nine innings, lost the duel and walked Klesko.</p>
        <p>Then he had Klesko picked off, but first baseman Lenny Harris, giving Todd Zeile a day off, threw the ball off Klesko's body for an error. Phil Nevin's bloop single scored Klesko with an unearned run.</p>
        <p>Rusch threw 34 pitches that inning and 36 in the second, an inning that began with Rivera being hit by a pitch. Darr singled, but with two outs, Eric Owens reached on an infield single when second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo threw late to third in an attempt to catch Rivera off base.</p>
        <p>The bases were loaded, and Rusch did the unthinkable: he walked the weak-hitting Desi Relaford to force in a run. Rusch kicked his leg in frustration, and Klesko slammed down his bat and helmet when he struck out one batter later to end the inning.</p>
        <p>Rusch continued to stumble in the third, when his curveball escaped him as Rivera bashed it for a run-scoring triple and Darr pounded it for a run-scoring single that put the Padres ahead, 4-0. A line-drive double play ended the inning, and there was no telling then that Rusch would settle down as he did, allowing one hit and striking out four over three scoreless innings.</p>
        <p>The Mets could not score for him until the sixth. In the fourth, Mike Piazza rifled a low line drive to the warning track in left field, where the ball took one bounce off the soft wall. Piazza could get only a single; he had hit it too hard for extra bases.</p>
        <p>Singles by Robin Ventura and Benny Agbayani loaded the bases for Jay Payton, who was 0 for 16 in his career with the bases loaded. He lined out to right, where Darr caught the ball and threw to first baseman Klesko, whose relay beat a sliding Piazza for the inning-ending double play.</p>
        <p>In the sixth, after Ventura's third single put runners at first and second, Agbayani blasted Williams's first pitch over the fence in left-center field. It was his 11th home run, and probably his most important since his game-winning grand slam in Tokyo in March. The three-run blast got the Mets into the game, and they tied it, 4-4, in the seventh.</p>
        <p>Mike Bordick reached on a throwing error by the shortstop Relaford and, with one out, Harris singled Bordick to third. Bell, who is in the midst of another awful slump, chopped a ball in front of first base, where Williams fielded it, wheeled and threw to home. But Bordick slid by with the tying run.</p>
