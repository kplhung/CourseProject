        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Collector Joins Artifacts Panel, Stirring Debate'' (Arts pages, Aug. 15):</p>
        <p>The view of the Archaeological Institute of America has long been that the way to control looting of antiquities is to outlaw antiquities dealers and to vilify collectors, in the hope that this will dry up the market. The policy has been a failure. Looting is worse than ever. If antiquities dealers were outlawed, this would simply drive the market underground.</p>
        <p>Many archaeologists believe that the only effective way to control looting is by harnessing market forces -- for example, by governments' selling genuine antiquities that have thousands of duplicates, by scientifically excavating sites that are being looted, by raising money for these excavations through arrangements with museums and other public institutions, and by regulating, rather than trying to eliminate, the antiquities market.</p>
