        <p>MP3Board.com, a Web site that provides links to and searching of music sites, asked a federal court in New York to declare that Gnutella, a software used to exchange music files via the Web, does not violate copyright law. The request escalates the legal battle between the site and the recording industry. The industry sued MP3Board.com in June in federal court, asserting that the site linked visitors to pirated music. MP3Board contends that it cannot be held liable for merely providing links to sites outside its control. In its latest brief, MP3Board wants the court to establish Gnutella as lawful, which would mean that providing ways to search Gnutella sites was lawful as well.</p>
