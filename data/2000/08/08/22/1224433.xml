        <p>F. X. Toole is an erudite and profane character with a seemingly apocryphal life: actor, teamster, salesman, bartender and bullfighter. He added one more trade in 1979 -- boxing trainer and cutman -- and has stuck with it since.</p>
        <p>Yet prominent boxing folk cannot place Mr. Toole or remember his corner work. One promoter wondered if he was a scam artist. Another said that if he were any good as a cutman, he would be known. They could not recall him even when told of a sideline that surely makes him stand out in their raffish universe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toole writes fiction, a craft that he quietly pursued when he wasn't stopping blood coming from fighters' noses. His first book of short fiction, ''Rope Burns: Stories From the Corner,'' is to be published next month by Ecco Press, an imprint of HarperCollins.</p>
        <p>The book has received lavish praise from the novelists Joyce Carol Oates and James Ellroy, each of whom has also made detours into writing about boxing.</p>
        <p>''He is unique,'' Ms. Oates said during a telephone interview. ''He's a born storyteller who uses the language of the ring.'' She described his prose as an ''an elevated colloquial American English.'' In its review, Publishers Weekly said that his writing was ''as tight as a well-laced pair of gloves.''</p>
        <p>Still, the widely known trainer Lou Duva has never heard of Mr. Toole, and chuckles at the idea of a cornerman moonlighting with fiction.</p>
        <p>''Half the cutmen I know can't speak English, let alone write it,'' Mr. Duva said, ''because they've got mouthpieces in their mouth.''</p>
        <p>Even Bob DePhillipis, who manages three fighters Mr. Toole claims to have assisted, said he had never heard of Mr. Toole until he was offered this description: tall, lean, short white hair, 70 years old.</p>
        <p>''That's Jerry Boyd!'' he said. ''He's been around the world with me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyd invented F. X. Toole to shield his boxing life (which has brought him psychic fulfillment but no riches) from his writing (which had until recently brought him only rejection). He did not want anyone in boxing to view him as anything but a cornerman or to be recognized for sucking up his gym buddies' lives and conversations for his short stories and novellas.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want anybody to know what I was doing,'' Mr. Boyd said during one of several rollicking telephone interviews from Los Angeles. ''And F. X. Toole lets me write determinedly Irish-Catholic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyd's lack of literary success made it easy to maintain his secret. ''I've failed at everything,'' he said. ''I failed with every woman, I failed as a father, I failed as a writer. I was a bullfighter, but I wasn't good enough to be a matador. I wrote, but I wasn't a writer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyd refused to divulge his writing to his ''boxing daddy,'' the trainer Dub Huntley, until a few months ago, when a book review by F. X. Toole appeared in The Los Angeles Times. ''He told me something about it, but I didn't believe him,'' said Mr. Huntley, a former middleweight with failing vision who uses Mr. Boyd as ''my eyes.'' ''I didn't think nothing of it.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Boyd's luck turned last year when Zyzzyva, a literary journal in San Francisco that he discovered in Writer's Market (a sourcebook of publishing opportunities), published one of his tales.</p>
        <p>Howard Junker, Zyzzyva's editor, said, ''My first thought was that he was a little like Hemingway, and I didn't know if that was good or not. But quite clearly it was more than that. He's enough of a naif not to know about strategies or to disguise or call attention to the act of narration.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyd celebrated the $50 sale with a dram of malt whiskey and some dark chocolate. ''My fondest dream was to get published in a literary magazine,'' he said. ''Think of the Sistine Chapel, with the fingers of God and Adam about to touch -- that's my story. The odds against me being published and talking to you about it are greater than the odds against the existence of God.''</p>
        <p>Nat Sobel, a Manhattan agent who trolls literary magazines in search of talent, read the story and wrote Mr. Boyd to ask if he had more to sell.</p>
        <p>''I was surprised I hadn't heard of him and wondered if F. X. was a pseudonym,'' Mr. Sobel said. He sold ''Rope Burns,'' five short stories and a novella, plus a future boxing novel to Ecco for a ''high five-figure sum.''</p>
        <p>Daniel Halpern, Ecco's editorial director, showed the collection to people at the publishing house who disliked boxing. ''Their reaction,'' he recalled, ''was immediate and intense: 'How does a cornerman learn to write?' ''</p>
        <p>(Answer: he takes one college writing course, attends no workshops, reads voraciously, absorbs the way boxing people act and talk, and writes long after there is any legitimate hope of being published.)</p>
        <p>Ecco is so certain of the quality of ''Rope Burns'' -- and of Mr. Boyd's impetuous personal magnetism -- that it has ordered an unusually large first printing of 50,000 copies and is sending him on a six-city tour. HBO is also negotiating for the rights to turn three stories into movies, Mr. Boyd said.</p>
        <p>''Rope Burns'' is inhabited by cynical and sentimental trainers, heroic boxers and slimy promoters, familiar archetypes flavored with Mr. Boyd's ring-savvy, story structure and use of dialect. His stories are essentially about love -- a love of pure boxing, a love between boxers and cornermen, and a love among cornermen -- conveyed in gentle, graphic and occasionally violent terms. But that love rarely equates with joy.</p>
        <p>Boxing may be corrupt, but when done right, Mr. Boyd sees magic. ''Some people say boxing is a metaphor for life,'' he said. ''I think life is a metaphor for boxing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyd grew up in Gardena, Calif., south of Los Angeles, the son of an Irish immigrant father and a mother who was raised in rural Ventura County. His mother's culinary legacy lives on in her son the recreational pie baker. ''People grovel when you come in with a pie,'' he said. ''It's better than being published.'' (He baked a gooseberry pie for Mr. Junker, who called it ''exquisite.'')</p>
        <p>He started acting in high school and graduated from Los Angeles City College with a drama degree in 1951. He joined the United States Navy Reserve and was posted at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn Through friends he made on Broadway, he began to take nighttime acting courses in 1953 under Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''I consider Sandy one of my writing teachers, particularly for dialogue and giving your characters freedom,'' he said. ''You must know your characters well enough to turn them loose.''</p>
        <p>He said that he was smitten by Mr. Meisner's technique, though not by the actor's life; he became more fascinated by bullfighting. He said he made it to Mexico, married and had a daughter. But his bullfighting resume included being gored three times. The bulls, he said, were learning more than he was.</p>
        <p>Needing money, he and his family returned to Los Angeles, where he began a long series of blue-collar jobs to support his family. He would eventually marry and divorce three times and father two sons. Mostly, he tended bar. ''I was close to the seven deadly sins at all times,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In 1979, nearly 50 years old, he followed a personal passion for boxing and tried to become a fighter. He trained and fought, but when his nose was broken and his teeth bashed in, he chose the safer route of becoming a cornerman. He later received a license from the California State Athletic commission.</p>
        <p>And he continued to write, intermittently and unsuccessfully.</p>
        <p>''I'd submit things and I'd be destroyed when they were rejected, but then I'd crawl back to the typewriter to do some more,'' he said. ''This went on for years and years, and it hurt so bad.''</p>
        <p>In the mid-to-late 1980's, he said, he quit writing altogether to focus entirely on boxing. His boxing profile is as modest as the boxers he has worked with, among them Jesus Salud, a former junior featherweight champion; Antoine Byrd, a supermiddleweight, and King Ipitan, a heavyweight, with whom Mr. Boyd had a falling-out.</p>
        <p>''I was happy with boxing, but I kept writing in my head,'' he said. ''I rejected it like I'd caught my wife cheating on me, like, 'I love you, now leave.' '' But after complications from heart surgery in 1988, he said, his religious faith was reawakened along with his ardor for writing.</p>
        <p>''One night, sitting in bed, I looked across the wall and saw a story,'' he said. ''I got to the point in my life that if I can see the story, I can write it. It's not mystical, just something that seems to happen.''</p>
        <p>Then, in 1996, while living in Missouri, he suffered a heart attack. In bed, he said, fearing death, he remembered a final task: tacking a new ending onto the novel he was rewriting. He said he ignored the heart attack and slept until morning: ''I woke up and climbed the hills to force the heart to work to see if I was dreaming. I had a little wine, a cigar and had sex. Then my heart began to hurt again, so I said if I'm going to die, I'm going to finish the novel, so I spent a few hours putting it together, and told the woman I was living with, 'Baby, let's go to Springfield,' and they inserted two stent implants.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyd's survival has positioned him for an unanticipated publishing deliverance, one that will come under the pseudonym F. X. Toole.</p>
        <p>''How could I have written all these years if the process isn't as rewarding as it is, as much as it hurts?'' he said. ''When you're on a roll, baby, there ain't nothing like it, like a guy who can throw six or eight punches in a row and come out unscathed, then can do it again and again. When I'm writing, I can get blown up, blown up to the ceiling. The muse taps you on the shoulder and it's love at first sight; if you don't follow, you look at yourself like a punk.''</p>
        <p>Magic in a Corrupt World</p>
        <p>Here are excerpts from F. X. Toole's ''Rope Burns,'' a forthcoming collection of short stories and a novella (Ecco Press):</p>
        <p>I'm not the one who decides when to stop the fight, and I don't stitch up cuts once the fight's over. And it's not my job to hospitalize a boy for brain damage. My job is to stop blood so the fighter can see enough to keep on fighting. I do that, maybe I save a boy's title. I do that one little thing, and I'm worth every cent they pay me. I stop the blood and save the fight, the boy loves me more than he loves his daddy.</p>
        <p>But you can't always stop it. Fight guys know this. If the cut's too deep or wide, or maybe you got a severed vein down in there, the blood keeps coming. Sometimes it takes two or three rounds to stop the blood, maybe more -- the boy's heart is pumping so hard, or he cuts more. -- From ''The Monkey Look''</p>
        <p>''Boxing is an unnatural act,'' whispered the voice. ''Understand me on this kid. Everything in boxing is backwards to life. You want to move to the left, you don't step left, you push on the right toe, like this. To move right, you use the left toe, see?'' The old white man didn't look into your eyes, he looked clear through your eyes, and straight to the inside of the back of your head. ''Instead of runnin' from pain, which is the natural thing in life, in boxing you step to it, get me? So now, once you've made the decision to be a fighter, now you gotta know how to fight, because no matter how tough you are, my friend, these dudes . . . will knock you out.''</p>
        <p>The voice of Frankie Dunn pierced. In the same sentence it could climb high and harsh or loop sweet as a peach, like Benny Goodman playing ''Body and Soul,'' or go on down deep as a grizzly's grunt. It could move sideways on you and then curl back on itself, but always the voice pierced the mind with images that stuck. -- From ''Million $$$ Baby''</p>
