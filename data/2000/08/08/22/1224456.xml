        <p>It is harder to tell who is hotter right now, the 3-year-old roan filly Gaviola, or her regular rider, Jerry Bailey. This afternoon, Gaviola rolled to her fifth consecutive victory, winning the 17th running of the Grade II Lake Placid Handicap in her usual front-running style under another flawless Bailey ride.</p>
        <p>But the performance was overshadowed by an incident earlier in the card, when a 2-year-old filly, Outrage, bled to death after fracturing her pelvis in the starting gate before today's third race. Outrage, who had raced twice previously, each time finishing third, apparently became spooked when a first-time starter, Climbeverymountain, was fractious in the gate. Another fractious first-time starter, Nice Weather, sustained a minor injury, after Outrage fell and became pinned underneath the gate.</p>

        <p>It is harder to tell who is hotter right now, the 3-year-old roan filly Gaviola, or her regular rider, Jerry Bailey. This afternoon, Gaviola rolled to her fifth consecutive victory, winning the 17th running of the Grade II Lake Placid Handicap in her usual front-running style under another flawless Bailey ride.</p>
        <p>But the performance was overshadowed by an incident earlier in the card, when a 2-year-old filly, Outrage, bled to death after fracturing her pelvis in the starting gate before today's third race. Outrage, who had raced twice previously, each time finishing third, apparently became spooked when a first-time starter, Climbeverymountain, was fractious in the gate. Another fractious first-time starter, Nice Weather, sustained a minor injury, after Outrage fell and became pinned underneath the gate.</p>
        <p>''She reared up, lost her balance and fell over in the gate,'' the New York Racing Association starter, Bob Duncan, said of Outrage, whose sire was Slew City Slew, a son of Seattle Slew. ''She thrashed around trying to regain her position. There's nothing you can physically do when a horse is in a panic state. And she was in such a position that the only way we could extricate her was to move the gate.''</p>
        <p>By then, a large piece from Outrage's pelvis had severed an artery, causing the filly to bleed to death.</p>
        <p>Outrage's trainer and part-owner, Allen Iwinski, said he did not blame the gate crew for the death. Instead, Iwinski said that he wished trainers of other juveniles would make more of an effort to school their colts and fillies in entering the starting gate during training so they would not act up as much at the races.</p>
        <p>In the feature race, Gaviola cruised the mile and an eighth on the turf in a strong 1 minute 48.04 seconds to best Good Game by two and a quarter lengths. Millie's Quest was third, followed by the Irish-bred Storm Dream, who chased Gaviola for the first mile of the race, before Bailey asked Gaviola for her final run.</p>
        <p>Windsong, Queue, Search Party, Wolf Alert, Battenkill, Solvig and Sound of the West completed the order of finish. Gaviola paid $3.80 to win for the trainer Billy Turner.</p>
        <p>Bailey, meanwhile, rode three more winners today to run his meet-leading total to 31 victories in 122 mounts, which is four more victories than Jorge Chavez has.</p>
