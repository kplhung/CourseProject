        <p>Can rock 'n' roll be serious? Not very, many would say. Rock addresses earthy matters, like flirting and shopping and blowing off steam after a hard work week. It's amateur at heart, silly in its soul. Even ambitious rockers need to leaven their aspirations with wit and humility. Otherwise they'll be branded with rock's scarlet P, for pretentiousness.</p>
        <p>Yet despite the perils of sobriety, recorded in countless mockeries of bands like U2, Rush and Pink Floyd, new artists venture into rock's obscure depths. A Perfect Circle, the all-star progressive metal band that played Saturday to a sold-out Roseland audience, is only the latest to grab the flashlight. And judging by the enthusiasm that made the band's June album, ''Mer de Noms'' (Virgin), the highest-charting debut from a rock band in recent memory, such somber explorers open tunnels listeners never tire of visiting.</p>

        <p>Can rock 'n' roll be serious? Not very, many would say. Rock addresses earthy matters, like flirting and shopping and blowing off steam after a hard work week. It's amateur at heart, silly in its soul. Even ambitious rockers need to leaven their aspirations with wit and humility. Otherwise they'll be branded with rock's scarlet P, for pretentiousness.</p>
        <p>Yet despite the perils of sobriety, recorded in countless mockeries of bands like U2, Rush and Pink Floyd, new artists venture into rock's obscure depths. A Perfect Circle, the all-star progressive metal band that played Saturday to a sold-out Roseland audience, is only the latest to grab the flashlight. And judging by the enthusiasm that made the band's June album, ''Mer de Noms'' (Virgin), the highest-charting debut from a rock band in recent memory, such somber explorers open tunnels listeners never tire of visiting.</p>
        <p>In the hands of a band like A Perfect Circle, arty rock strives to be a heart-opening mystery rite. That's not to say it reveals anything new. To achieve the ritual mood the music must be fairly conservative. The singer who presides over the music's ceremony must also use proven formulas to invoke the desired response.</p>
        <p>For Maynard James Keenan, lyricist and focal presence in A Perfect Circle, this means returning to the place where the sacred meets the profane, carrying on rock's long fascination with paganism. With titles like ''Magdalena'' and ''Orestes,'' his songs troll the annals of myth in the service of modern ideas like self-realization and sexual freedom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Keenan performed most of Saturday's show nearly unclothed, with a spinal tattoo peeking out from beneath maroon briefs and his bleached hair falling seductively over his torso. His nakedness was the cloak that transformed him into a rock shaman. It demonstrated his daring and sexual self-confidence, and recalled cliches of orgiastic mystics stretching back to the ancient world.</p>
        <p>A modern idea of antiquity is central to A Perfect Circle's image and sound. Billy Howerdel, the guitarist who writes the band's music, layered chiming chords in slow arpeggios in an approximation of early choral music. The drummer Josh Freese and the bassist Paz Lenchantin augmented the prettiness with heavy, aboriginal beats. The second guitarist, Troy Van Leeuwen, added modern rock flourishes reminiscent of the Cure, a big influence the band acknowledged in a cover of ''Love Song'' that also nodded to Ozzy Osbourne.</p>
        <p>Connecting psychedelia and occult metal to music of the church and the tribal circle, the group laid claim to timelessness the way bands have at least since the 1970's. Mr. Keenan sang like a corrupted choirboy, his howls retaining their prettiness, and his mates careened around the stage as if buffeted by their own waves of noise.</p>
        <p>Tool, the other band Mr. Keenan leads, is harder-edged than A Perfect Circle, but both groups rely on Mr. Keenan's ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity. To skeptics his soul's journey may seem awfully familiar. But ritual isn't always best served by originality. It's the repetition that renews it.</p>
