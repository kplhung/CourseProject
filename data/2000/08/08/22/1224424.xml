        <p>Ever since scientists reported last year that pollen from genetically engineered corn could kill monarch butterfly caterpillars in the laboratory, scientists, industry representatives and activists opposed to genetic engineering have been battling over one central question: Are these butterflies being harmed by the millions of acres of biotech corn being planted across the country?</p>
        <p>Now, in the first study published on the subject since the debate began, scientists from Iowa State University say plants growing in and near the corn fields are being dusted with enough toxic pollen to kill monarch caterpillars that feed on them. The genetically modified corn produces the insecticide Bt in its tissues, including its windblown pollen.</p>
        <p>It is the first published data showing the potential for genetically engineered pollen in the wild to harm monarchs, scientists say, but leaves open the crucial question of what impact the corn actually has on the butterfly population. Critics of the original study, published by researchers at Cornell University, said caterpillars in the study could have died because they were fed levels of toxic pollen that were much higher than those found in nature.</p>
        <p>''This is telling us that with naturally deposited pollen there's a good probability you'll get some mortality,'' said Dr. John Obrycki, who along with Laura Hansen wrote the article published Saturday in the journal Oecologia.</p>
        <p>In their study, the researchers gathered leaves from plants growing in and around corn fields and onto which pollen had blown. The leaves were then fed to caterpillars in the laboratory. Twenty percent of the caterpillars eating leaves bearing genetically engineered pollen died, while all caterpillars eating leaves with regular corn pollen survived.</p>
        <p>''This is a big deal,'' said Dr. John Losey, one of the authors on the original Cornell study. ''It's an important next step.''</p>
        <p>But the new study seems to have only fueled the battle for public opinion inspired by the monarch butterfly, which has become a symbol to many of fragile nature threatened by genetic engineering.</p>
        <p>''This study should dispel any doubts about whether or not the effect observed in the Cornell study is a real one in the field,'' said Dr. Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, a group that has been critical of the biotechnology industry and its regulators. ''The Environmental Protection Agency should take some steps to ensure that butterflies in this coming planting season are protected.''</p>
        <p>Industry representatives say the new study did not accurately reflect what is happening in nature.</p>
        <p>''I don't see how this can be construed as a field study,'' said Lisa Dry, spokeswoman for the Biotechnology Industry Organization, referring to the fact that leaves from the field were brought back to the lab to be fed to caterpillars. Ms. Dry said she believed that rain, wind and sun would degrade the pollen to the point that caterpillars' chances of contacting toxic pollen in nature was ''remote.'' Ms. Dry said she knew of 20 other studies that would disagree with the new research, though none had yet been published. ''We're confident that the Bt has minimal, if any, impact,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Scientists interviewed agreed that  the ultimate effect on monarchs was still uncertain.</p>
        <p>So far the Environmental Protection Agency has requested but not required farmers to alter plantings to reduce the flow of genetically engineered pollen out of their fields. The agency has announced that the registrations that allow the widespread planting of Bt corn would be extended until September 2001.</p>
