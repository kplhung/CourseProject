        <p>One of the many odd experiences of being a psychiatrist is discovering that seemingly benign traits can have a dark and even pathological side to them.</p>
        <p>A characteristic that we would typically dismiss lightly in everyday life -- a tendency to procrastinate, a hot temper, or a fastidiousness about details -- sends up a red flag for a psychiatrist.</p>
        <p>Is this simply a quirk or is it part of a more pervasive behavioral pattern? And if it is the latter, should it simply be considered the person's style or could it be part of a disorder in need of treatment? At times what appears to be a minor eccentricity can afford a glimpse into a large and unsuspected landscape of symptoms.</p>
        <p>Shyness is a case in point. I had always thought of shyness as a sweet, even endearing quality. But that was before I first met Mr. Alonzo in the waiting room.</p>
        <p>I saw an elegant, if conservatively dressed, man in his early 30's. As I shook his hand and introduced myself, he flashed me a tense smile but did not meet my eyes. In my office, Mr. Alonzo stared into the middle distance and haltingly told me why he had come to see me.</p>
        <p>He was an accountant at an established firm, and he had recently been passed over for a promotion, despite his history of outstanding work. His boss had taken him aside to explain the problem: he made clients uncomfortable. Mr. Alonzo was at a loss as to how to begin to address this issue.</p>
        <p>By the end of the consultation, I knew just what his boss was talking about. Mr. Alonzo's replies to my routine questions were terse to the point of being monosyllabic. The conversation never flowed. It lurched from statement to statement. The few times when he tried to expand on a point, Mr. Alonzo would suddenly break off, look at me searchingly and lapse into silence. I realized that I, too, was becoming uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>In themselves, these feelings of anxiety did not surprise me. Transiently experiencing the same symptoms as a patient is a well-documented phenomenon in psychiatry. Depressed patients can leave therapists mildly enervated; angry patients can leave them in a slow burn. Actually, such elicited feelings are often used as handy therapeutic guideposts. But what amazed me in this patient was the intensity of the sensations I was beginning to share with him. I felt increasingly self-conscious as my words hung in the air. It was painful.</p>
        <p>As I questioned Mr. Alonzo further, it became clear that his symptoms of shyness infiltrated his life outside of work as well. He rarely ventured beyond his small circle of friends, and his girlfriend complained about his reclusiveness -- he always preferred for them to sit home.  Mr. Alonzo rarely picked up the phone, preferring to communicate by e-mail.</p>
        <p>To the outside world, Mr. Alonzo was a highly competent professional with some social awkwardness. But the pervasiveness and intensity of his symptoms suggested that he had crossed the diagnostic Rubicon from a simple occasional shyness to a severe, chronic shyness across a multitude of situations.</p>
        <p>The psychiatric terms for shyness of this intensity, social phobia or social anxiety disorder, may appear to bestow a slightly pompous, pseudo-medical sound to a common human trait. But a large body of research has demonstrated that such symptoms do, in fact, define a seriously debilitating condition.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Alonzo, people with this disorder often lead difficult and diminished lives. The emotional toll of the disease is huge. Studies have shown that a majority of people with social phobia have difficulty reaching their educational and professional goals or even maintaining employment. They can be more likely to  depend on others financially and to try to relieve anxiety with alcohol and drugs.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because of the very recessiveness of the symptoms that define social phobia, until recently psychiatrists remained largely unaware of the diagnosis. And for many people, social phobia is still experienced as a perplexing series of private defeats. Explaining to patients that they have a defined illness often causes relief.</p>
        <p>When I described the syndrome of social phobia to Mr. Alonzo at the end of the consultation, he listened with a look of incredulity.</p>
        <p>Then, for the first time in the session, as he slowly considered what I had said, he looked me directly in the eye. For a long while, we sat there together in silence. But it was a comfortable, shared silence as we both contemplated the long, difficult road he had traveled alone.</p>
