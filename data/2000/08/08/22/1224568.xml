      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Other than a brief screaming match after Sunday's game, most of the recent communication between Yankees Manager Joe Torre and reliever Jeff Nelson has been inferred. Nelson has been unhappy with the way Torre has used him lately, but when Torre brought him in to pitch an inning late in yesterday's wipeout of Texas, Nelson took that as a good sign.</p>
        <p>''I try to read into it that I am important and that I need to be consistent,'' Nelson said. ''And the way to get consistent is to go out there and pitch an inning or so.''</p>

        <p>Other than a brief screaming match after Sunday's game, most of the recent communication between Yankees Manager Joe Torre and reliever Jeff Nelson has been inferred. Nelson has been unhappy with the way Torre has used him lately, but when Torre brought him in to pitch an inning late in yesterday's wipeout of Texas, Nelson took that as a good sign.</p>
        <p>''I try to read into it that I am important and that I need to be consistent,'' Nelson said. ''And the way to get consistent is to go out there and pitch an inning or so.''</p>
        <p>Nelson has had control problems for a month or so, and Torre has used him more sparingly since the All-Star Game break. Nelson has been perturbed about being removed after one or two batters; he expressed his displeasure to Torre on the mound as he was being relieved Sunday.</p>
        <p>After that game, Nelson said, Torre confronted him in the players' food room and the two screamed at each other ''for about 20 seconds. I've had ups and downs with him in the past, and it has all worked out.''</p>
        <p>Nelson added: ''I have no problem with him. Obviously, I disagree with some of the stuff he does, and I don't understand it -- and still don't understand why I'm coming in and not being allowed to get out of my jams; that still hasn't been explained to me. But when my name is called, I'll still go out there and do my best.''</p>
        <p>Before the game, Torre said: ''It's an emotional thing. You get upset. I never want to take away the player's right to react, positive or negative. I think it's necessary to let your feelings be known. Nellie's struggling right now. He's a little more sensitive than he normally would be.''</p>
        <p>Nelson held the Rangers scoreless in the eighth inning, and Torre said he was pleased with the right-hander's aggressiveness.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch on Schedule</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch continued to make progress yesterday in his rehabilitation from right-elbow trouble, while working out in Tampa, Fla. If Knoblauch does not have a setback, he could begin his minor league assignment Thursday or Friday and rejoin the Yankees in about a week.</p>
        <p>The right-hander Ramiro Mendoza threw for the first time yesterday since getting a shot of cortisone in the back of his shoulder. The Yankees are hoping Mendoza can come back sometime next month.</p>
        <p>No Olympics for Curtis</p>
        <p>His time with the Yankees has Chad Curtis craving the pursuit of championships, and Curtis thought he would be doing so again this fall. The subject of trade talks before the July 31 deadline, Curtis thought he would be dealt to the Yankees late last month, and at one point last week, he began to believe he would be part of the United States Olympic baseball team.</p>
        <p>But Curtis will finish his season with the Texas Rangers, who are playing out the season in last place in the American League West.</p>
        <p>Curtis, who received his 1999 World Series ring before the game, raised the idea of playing for the Olympic team several weeks ago, taking it to the Rangers' management. Curtis reasoned that Texas intended to field and develop young players in the final weeks of the season, and that he could do more to represent the organization if he were playing in the Olympics. Curtis established immediately that he was willing to forfeit his major league salary to be a part of the Olympics. ''It was something I thought was a long shot at the start,'' Curtis said.</p>
        <p>But the Rangers' front office surprised him by embracing the idea, and Curtis and the players association sorted through other procedural problems last week. ''At certain times during the process, I thought it was probably going to come together,'' Curtis said.</p>
        <p>At the end of last week, however, an official from the Olympic team informed Texas General Manager Doug Melvin that there were concerns of an unforeseen obstacle cropping up; the Olympic team didn't want to give a spot to Curtis and pass up the chance to pick somebody else, only to see Curtis withdraw.</p>
        <p>''To be honest with you, I don't know what the obstacles were,'' Curtis said.</p>
        <p>''I grew up watching the Olympics. I wanted to spend a couple of weeks in Australia, be able to take some video of me and my girls at the Olympics; my son is a year old now. I just think it would've been a good experience. I've had people look at me and say, 'You're making how much money?' I said: 'I've made money before. I haven't played in the Olympics.' ''</p>
        <p>The Yankees and the Rangers discussed a deal involving Curtis in July, but the day before the deadline -- and couple of days after Texas sent first baseman David Segui to Cleveland -- Texas elected to keep reliever John Wetteland, Curtis and others. ''I hadn't started packing my bags,'' said Curtis, who heard about the trade talks, ''but I had mentally started thinking about the idea.''</p>
