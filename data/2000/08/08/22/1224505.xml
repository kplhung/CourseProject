        <p>Kenneth A. Gibson, who was Newark's mayor for 16 years, pleaded not guilty today at his arraignment on federal fraud and bribery charges -- and then pleaded poverty, asking the court to pay for his current defense lawyer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibson, who in 1970 became the first black to be elected mayor of a major Northeastern city, is charged along with two business associates with defrauding the Irvington Board of Education between 1991 and 1995, when his engineering firm was construction manager of a $50 million school rehabilitation and construction project.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibson's lawyer of four years, Cathy Fleming, said today in United States District Court here that he had insufficient income and assets to pay her to represent him. His personal property holdings could not finance the expense of a complex and long federal trial, she said, and many of his business holdings in partnership with others were tied up because of nearly $1 million in other court judgments.</p>
        <p>Ralph J. Marra Jr., the assistant United States attorney prosecuting the case, opposed both Ms. Fleming's request for court-financed representation and her request to continue as Mr. Gibson's lawyer. Mr. Marra said  he believed that Mr. Gibson's assets made him ineligible for taxpayer assistance and that the federal law providing such assistance was not intended to let a defendant pick his own lawyer.</p>
        <p>Judge William G. Bassler asked both sides to submit detailed arguments and said he would rule on the defense requests at a hearing on Sept. 6.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibson, 68, whose indictment on the charges was unsealed on July 24, was allowed to remain free on a $300,000 personal recognizance bond.  Also pleading not guilty and released on a $100,000 personal recognizance bond were his co-defendants, Camille Savoca, 53, vice president of the engineering consulting firm, Gibson Associates, and William Bernowich, 53,  an employee.</p>
        <p>It is not unusual, even in high-profile cases involving public officials, for the court to appoint and pay for a defense lawyer when the defendant is unable to pay. It is unusual, but not unprecedented, for a defendant to keep the same private lawyer he had before seeking court assistance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fleming, an experienced defense lawyer who once was a chief in the special prosecutions unit of the United States attorney in New Jersey -- the unit prosecuting this case -- said that in appointing her, the court would get ''competent counsel with a good familiarity with the case.''</p>
        <p>''This saves taxpayers money because the learning curve is eliminated,'' she said after today's arraignment. ''Plus, I suspect others would tell you that it is a matter of some sensitivity that a public figure like Ken Gibson ought to have someone representing him who is familiar with the case.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fleming is on the panel of lawyers that federal judges draw from to provide court-financed representation to defendants who cannot otherwise afford to pay a lawyer. Under the court program those lawyers receive a maximum of $75 an hour. Ms. Fleming's normal fee is $425 an hour. She said she nevertheless felt ''strongly about representing someone who did an awful lot for American politics.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marra said that Mr. Gibson did not meet the economic criteria for such court-financed representation and that he expected to show that by submitting detailed appraisals of two pieces of Newark property that the former mayor owns. He also said the value of the business properties that were the subject of the court judgments would more than cover those judgments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marra, in seeking successfully to attach conditions to Mr. Gibson's bail, asked the court to prohibit him from trying to make contact with or approach the property of an unnamed cooperating witness in the case. In court papers, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents working on the case said that as recently as June, when it became known that the witness was cooperating, a relative of the witness saw Mr. Gibson circling the block around the family's home four times.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fleming denied that her client had done such a thing, calling the assertion ''ridiculous.'' She said Mr. Gibson and the witness lived within three blocks of each other, perhaps explaining why Mr. Gibson may have been seen so often.</p>
