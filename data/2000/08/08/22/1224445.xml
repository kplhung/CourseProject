        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>After President Clinton's speech at the Democratic National Convention (front page, Aug. 15), speculation has begun about what he will do after he leaves office.</p>
        <p>There is an obvious role for Mr. Clinton: as a roving ambassador, concentrating on explosive areas around the world. His prestige is greater abroad than in the United States. People in other countries tend to minimize his sexual misdemeanors and focus on his personality, experience and grasp of the complexities of politics.</p>
        <p>We've had some brilliant 20th-century presidents, but none with the combination of intellectual and personality features that mark Mr. Clinton. Having a trouble-shooter with his standing around the world would be an invaluable asset to any administration.</p>
        <p>REO M. CHRISTENSON  Miamisburg, Ohio, Aug. 17, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is professor emeritus of political science at Miami University, Ohio.</p>
