        <p>Glenallen Hill squeezed his shoulders through the doors to the press room the other day, striding steadily along a shortcut to the home clubhouse at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>A picture hanging on the wall seized his imagination and he stopped suddenly. ''Look at that,'' he said. ''Look at those arms.''</p>
        <p>It was a black-and-white picture of a Yankee hitter, his face contorted at the end of a massive swing, his pinstriped jersey barely restraining the muscles of his shoulders and biceps. Hill was fascinated.</p>
        <p>''That's amazing,'' Hill said. ''Who is that?''</p>
        <p>The picture is of Mickey Mantle, a long-reigning heir to the Yankees' heritage of power hitters, a tradition Hill is embracing.</p>
        <p>He hit his 11th home run in his 18-game Yankee career yesterday, a 12-3 blowout against Texas.</p>
        <p>Orlando Hernandez won for the first time since July 7, surrendering six hits and three runs over seven innings.</p>
        <p>All five of the Yankees' starters have now contributed solid outings in the last trip through the rotation.</p>
        <p>Jorge Posada ripped a two-run homer and drove in four runs, and Clay Bellinger contributed three hits. Bellinger has reached base in his last seven plate appearances.</p>
        <p>The Yankees played without Bernie Williams, who has a strain in the right side of his rib cage, but who might return tomorrow.</p>
        <p>They were also without David Justice, a late scratch from the starting lineup because of stiffness in his neck.</p>
        <p>In their absence, Hill, the designated hitter, slid into the cleanup spot naturally, and by the time he chipped in with his two hits, the Yankees' rout of Brian Sikorski was well under way.</p>
        <p>Sikorski, a Texas right-hander, shut out the Yankees for seven innings last week, and after he held them scoreless in the first two innings yesterday,  Manager Joe Torre loudly chided his players in the dugout for swinging at bad pitches.</p>
        <p>By forcing Sikorski to throw 41 pitches in the third inning, the Yankees scored six runs.</p>
        <p>Hill batted in the fourth inning and ripped a line drive toward left, where the Rangers' Rusty Greer -- one of the best fielders at his position -- moved to cut off the ball.</p>
        <p>But Hill's liner, moving much faster than Greer thought, got past the Ranger, allowing Paul O'Neill to score.</p>
        <p>O'Neill was on first again for Hill's next at-bat, in the sixth, and Hill laced another line drive, this one carrying over the left-field fence. While Hill jogged around the bases, the small afternoon crowd roaring, the batboy, John Viola, retrieved Hill's bat and noticed a deep crack in the handle, just above the place where Hill places his hands.</p>
        <p>Hill had broken his bat and still hit the ball about 420 feet.</p>
        <p>Viola showed Hill the crack when he returned to the dugout, and the bat was examined by teammates. ''That just shows you how strong his wrists are,'' Viola, 17, said.</p>
        <p>Torre joked: ''I said to him, 'It was easy; with your hands you were able to hold the bat together.' It's amazing what he's done. It's fun to watch on our side because if you make a mistake, he's going to hit it hard.''</p>
        <p>First baseman Tino Martinez said: ''He's obviously a strong guy. He's got a short, compact swing. He's not overswinging; he's short and compact to the ball, and he's hitting it hard. Even when he strikes out, he's taking good swings.''</p>
        <p>Hill has been with the Yankees for less than a month and he is already known to his teammates as something of an eccentric personality.</p>
        <p>He plays music loudly -- ''all kinds,'' Derek Jeter said -- and speaks softly.</p>
        <p>He wears eye black for both night and day games. He dresses elegantly, but swings his bat viciously, quickly, powerfully. ''Like Muhammad Ali's left jab,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Apparently, there are ways to get Hill out. He came into the 2000 season with a .271 career batting average, striking out often, once for every 4.5 at-bats.</p>
        <p>If he gets behind in the count, Hill inspires opposing pitchers to throw breaking balls down and away, or fastballs high and inside to finish him off.</p>
        <p>But Hill, 35, is batting .446, with 4 doubles and 11 homers in 56 at-bats. His slugging percentage is 1.107. ''I don't know -- I don't want to jinx it,'' Hill said.</p>
        <p>He swings hard and is hitting everything very hard; this is not a fluke, Martinez said.</p>
        <p>Hill's explosion is reminiscent of Shane Spencer's run at the end of the 1998 season, when he bashed 10 homers in 67 regular-season at-bats and added a couple more in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''He's a lot stronger than Shane is,'' Martinez said of Hill. ''He can hit the ball out anywhere in the ballpark. When he hits the ball hard, it's going out. It doesn't matter where. Shane turned on his a lot. This guy is hitting them out to right field, left field, center. This guy is just ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>Martinez often follows Hill in the lineup. ''It's definitely fun,'' he said, smiling. ''But it makes me feel like a Little Leaguer after a while.''</p>
