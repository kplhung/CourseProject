        <p>From wage increases to greater pension benefits to less mandatory overtime, telecommunications union workers in 12 Eastern states from Maine to Virginia and the District of Columbia appear to have been the victors in the strike that ended yesterday for more than half of the 86,000 workers who walked off their jobs 16 days ago.</p>
        <p>What is more, the unions' agreement with Verizon Communications, the nation's largest telecommunications employer, with 260,000 employees around the nation, touches many of the hot-button issues of the new economy -- including stock options, profit-sharing and the relentlessness of long workdays.</p>
        <p>As the company tried to bring the remaining 40,000 or so strikers in several mid-Atlantic states into the fold yesterday, labor and management experts were marveling at a settlement that is generous by almost any measure.</p>
        <p>''This is a huge victory for the unions because it shows what they can do in parts of the economy where they still have leverage,'' said Paul Osterman, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''But I suppose it remains to be seen how this plays out in wireless organizing, the most tantalizing part of the agreement, because that's where unions have far less leverage.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, it was one matter for the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to go on strike against Verizon, a company formed by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. The strike involved workers in the union's stronghold -- the region formerly served by Bell Atlantic. But it is quite another task to begin organizing at the company's wireless division, where fewer than 50 of 32,000 employees around the country are unionized.</p>
        <p>And yet the unions won concessions that should make it easier to try to recruit members at Verizon Wireless unit -- the issue at the heart of the strike. The unions, particularly the Communications Workers of America, are intent on organizing workers at the mobile-telephone company, which is operated in a venture with Vodafone AirTouch of Britain. Verizon Wireless is the nation's largest wireless carrier, with more than 25 million subscribers, and it is growing much faster than Verizon's conventional telephone services.</p>
        <p>Analysts say it is too early to gauge how the union effort might play out with the wireless unit, where organizing is not expected to begin in earnest for six months or so. The union will no doubt be pointing to wage disparities between some workers -- like customer service representatives, who can make no more than $33,000 a year at Verizon Wireless, but as much as $44,400 for Verizon's union telephone company.</p>
        <p>While the natural inclination of Wall Street is to associate union jobs with higher costs, some analysts say greater unionization could have a potentially positive impact in some parts of the company.</p>
        <p>The unions, for example, won a concession from the company allowing their members to perform the entire installation of high-speed Internet access for customers who sign up for Verizon's Internet services. (Wholesale installations performed by Verizon under other companies' names would not necessarily be performed by union workers, according to a person involved in the talks.)  Union members are expected to be able to complete the installation process in about a day, instead of the two days it can sometimes take when Verizon uses nonunion contractors to perform some of the tasks of each installation.</p>
        <p>''A shorter installation cycle should quicken Verizon's deployment of access,'' said Joseph Bellace, an analyst at Jefferies &amp; Company who covers companies providing high-speed Internet access. ''It sort of surprises me that this hasn't happened sooner.''</p>
        <p>Verizon officials, too, sought to put a positive spin on the unions' new contract. ''I'm thoroughly confident this will enhance our competitiveness,'' Lawrence T. Babbio, vice chairman of Verizon, said in an interview. ''We've found ways to motivate our employees on a performance basis that will also reduce churn within the organization.''</p>
        <p>In another move that could speed Verizon's effort to transform itself into a nimble new-economy player, the company created a profit-sharing plan -- pegged to that of the chief executive, Ivan Seidenberg -- that would provide payouts of up to $1,000 a year per employee.</p>
        <p>And adopting a benefit similar to the nonunion competitors that Verizon competes with in many parts of its business, the company will hand out a small number of stock options to union members in an effort to further interest them in Verizon's overall financial performance and efficiency. Full-time employees will receive a one-time grant of 100 stock options, while part-time employees will receive 50.</p>
        <p>As union members absorb details of the agreement before meeting to vote on its approval over the next three weeks, the company and financial analysts mainly seem relieved that the strike is effectively over. Verizon said it had a backlog of some 78,000 repair orders, about 38,000 of these including people with no service at all and 40,000 with trouble like static on the line.</p>
        <p>And there are an estimated backlog of 200,000 orders for new installations of service, which Verizon hopes to clear up in about a month. This estimate anticipates an increase in orders as students return to universities along the East Coast in coming weeks.</p>
        <p>''No matter how good the agreement looks to the unions, Verizon nipped the real risk of the strike in the bud by ending it before it entered into September,'' said Courtney Quinn, an analyst at the Yankee Group, a telecommunications consulting company.</p>
        <p>Investors expressed mild optimism yesterday, bidding up Verizon's shares 69 cents yesterday, to a closing price of $42.81.</p>
        <p>Of course, there is the lingering risk that the bargaining unit for the communications workers' union representing nearly 40,000 employees in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, could let the strike drag on in their states.</p>
        <p>But people close to the talks yesterday said it was unlikely that those unions would not eventually sign on. The sticking points are apparently not over the main terms of the contract, but finer points involving pensions, job titles and mandatory overtime. ''It's a question of putting the remaining pieces into the puzzle,'' said Jeff Miller, spokesman for the communications workers' union.</p>
