        <p>The Republican presidential campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Dick Cheney began showing two new commercials in 21 states yesterday. One deals with Mr. Bush's education proposals and the other declares that now is the time to deal with ''tough problems,'' such as Social Security, declining moral values and education.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER Maverick Media for both</p>
        <p>'Education Agenda'</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Bush accepting the Republican presidential nomination. Children running in a school hallway. Mr. Bush again. Then four quick cuts, showing alphabet blocks, children reading and other school scenes, followed by another scene of Mr. Bush from the convention.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Bush: ''Seven out of 10 fourth graders in our highest poverty schools cannot read a simple children's book. Millions are trapped in schools where violence is common and learning is rare.'' Announcer (as school scenes shift): ''The Bush education agenda: Reform Head Start, focus on reading, restore local control, triple funding for character education, hold schools accountable for results.'' Mr. Bush: ''Now is the time to teach all our children to read and renew the promise of America's public schools.''</p>
        <p>'Hard Things'</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Bush, in a sport shirt, talking to the camera. Then, as he discusses problems, pictures of a classroom, of elderly women singing around a piano with trophies on it, of a black woman and of a teenage girl in a shot that widens to include a teenage boy. Then Mr. Bush again.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Bush: ''This is a moment in history when we have a chance to focus on tough problems. It's not always popular to say 'Our children can't read' or 'Social Security needs improving' or 'We have a budget surplus and a deficit in values.' But those are the right things to say. And the right way to make America better for everyone is to be bold and decisive, to unite instead of divide. Now is the time to do the hard things.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Aside from the assertion about reading levels in schools in the poorest neighborhoods, which is based on a federal Department of Education study, neither advertisement includes factual statements that could be either accurate or inaccurate. Mr. Bush has indeed made the education proposals that his commercial cites.</p>
        <p>SCORE CARD -- The education commercial is intended to re-emphasize one of Mr. Bush's political strengths, the impression that he cares deeply about education, long a Democratic strong point. The ''Hard Things'' commercial is intended to underline an argument made in his acceptance speech that the Clinton administration squandered the opportunity presented by economic prosperity to solve major problems. And its call ''to unite instead of divide'' seeks to imply that the Gore campaign is divisive and negative. That was a Bush strength after the Republican convention, but a CBS News Poll released on Monday shows that more people now say Mr. Bush, not Mr. Gore, is spending more time on the attack.</p>
