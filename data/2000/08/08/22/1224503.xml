        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has settled on a treatment regimen for his prostate cancer. But that is all he wants to disclose for now about how he is trying to beat the disease.</p>
        <p>The mayor, 56, dropped out of the United States Senate race in May after announcing that the early-stage cancer had been diagnosed a month earlier. Later, he said he was starting a hormonal therapy that shrinks prostate cancer tumors. But his deliberations continued over whether to pick surgery or a radiation therapy as the primary treatment.</p>
        <p>Asked yesterday about his progress in settling on an approach, he said, ''I have made up my mind, and I am doing what I am doing.'' But he declined to disclose which option he had picked and when -- or even if -- he expected he would have to miss work. ''I'd like to take a break, actually, probably to play golf, more than to get treated,'' he said at his daily news conference at City Hall. Growing more serious, he said, ''But yes, I will let you know when I am taking a break or when I need to take a break.'' Finally, he added, ''Maybe I can do it without taking a break.''</p>
        <p>The mayor's comments suggested he had decided on radiation treatment, an option he said he was ''probably leaning toward'' in an Aug. 3 interview on ''Larry King Live.''</p>
        <p>A patient undergoing prostate cancer surgery typically is hospitalized for two or three days and then misses work for at least three weeks while he recovers, said Dr. Patrick C. Walsh, chief of urology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, who emphasized that he was not commenting directly on the mayor's case.</p>
        <p>Dr. Walsh said that patients undergoing radiation seed placement, which requires a hospital visit though release can come the same day, typically can return to work within a few days. Patients undergoing a second method of radiation treatment, called external beam radiotherapy, are treated briefly each day for six to eight weeks, again usually without overnight hospitalization, he said. Although the patient may experience some fatigue, he usually can maintain most normal activities, including work. Some patients opt to use both radiation treatments, Dr. Walsh said.</p>
        <p>Several of Mr. Giuliani's friends and advisers said yesterday that they did not know what option the mayor had picked. But the mayor himself has said that making the decision has been hard, noting that he has never been seriously ill before. ''So you know, 56 years old, all of a sudden you face a situation like this, and you haven't been used to it, you have to adjust to it,'' he told Mr. King in the interview on CNN.</p>
