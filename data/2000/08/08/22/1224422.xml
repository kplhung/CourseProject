        <p>A convincing victory for a California team in the Spingold Knockout concluded the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals here on Sunday night. Rose Johnson Meltzer and Peter Weichsel, both of Los Gatos, Kyle Larsen of San Francisco, Lew Stansby of Castro Valley and Chip Martel of Davis, together with Alan Sontag of Manhattan, led from the start, winning by 94 imps. This was the first victory for a woman in the event since 1963.</p>
        <p>The losers were a dark-horse team: Roy Welland and Brad Moss of Manhattan, Marc Jacobus of Las Vegas, Fred Gitelman of Toronto, and Magnus Lindkvist and Peter Fredin of Sweden. They had reached the final by defeating three top-ranked teams in earlier rounds.</p>
