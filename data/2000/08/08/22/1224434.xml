        <p>Three decades ago, in his film ''Ludwig van,'' Mauricio Kagel suggested that the world could best pay homage to Beethoven by refraining from performing his music for a year. At Bard College last weekend the approach was different: not restraint but bombardment, by means of six concerts supported by lectures, discussions and films, Mr. Kagel's included. Yet perhaps the effect was like what a year's silence would have produced: a freshening of responses.</p>
        <p>It was generated partly by programming pieces that few people in the audience can ever have had a chance before to respond to, like the canons Beethoven wrote as jokes between friends, or the complete score of incidental music he composed for Goethe's ''Egmont.'' Apart from the ''Egmont'' entr'actes, one indicating what a Beethoven oboe concerto might have sounded like, there were no great discoveries. Beethoven was perfectly capable of writing a routine march or waltz, and ''Wellington's Victory,'' played right after the ''Egmont'' music, turned out to be as loud and crude as everyone has always said, even if there was certainly a thrill in hearing it, with opposing quartets of trumpeters sounding French and British calls and cannon effects firing off to right and left outside the concert tent.</p>

        <p>Three decades ago, in his film ''Ludwig van,'' Mauricio Kagel suggested that the world could best pay homage to Beethoven by refraining from performing his music for a year. At Bard College last weekend the approach was different: not restraint but bombardment, by means of six concerts supported by lectures, discussions and films, Mr. Kagel's included. Yet perhaps the effect was like what a year's silence would have produced: a freshening of responses.</p>
        <p>It was generated partly by programming pieces that few people in the audience can ever have had a chance before to respond to, like the canons Beethoven wrote as jokes between friends, or the complete score of incidental music he composed for Goethe's ''Egmont.'' Apart from the ''Egmont'' entr'actes, one indicating what a Beethoven oboe concerto might have sounded like, there were no great discoveries. Beethoven was perfectly capable of writing a routine march or waltz, and ''Wellington's Victory,'' played right after the ''Egmont'' music, turned out to be as loud and crude as everyone has always said, even if there was certainly a thrill in hearing it, with opposing quartets of trumpeters sounding French and British calls and cannon effects firing off to right and left outside the concert tent.</p>
        <p>But the inherent quality of the Beethoven marginalia, which also included small and faintly charming choral pieces made to mark a landlady's demise and a patron's son's birthday, was not really the issue. The point was to show Beethoven as more (or, perhaps, less) than the composer of the great works. Indeed, some of the liveliest programs were those that presented central pieces alongside eccentric ones: two of the late quartets with the canons and the singing birthday card for Prince Ferdinand Lobkowitz, or the Diabelli Variations and last cello sonata with some of the arrangements of British folk songs, made at the same time. Beethoven was heard as a working composer, sneaking masterpieces between potboilers.</p>
        <p>A couple of programs gave a little insight into the market in which he had to operate. One was devoted to some of the works most popular in his lifetime (to his disgust, in many cases), including the Septet ''Adelaide'' and the finale from the piano trio version of the Second Symphony. The image was that of a sentimental, curtailed Beethoven, radically different from the Promethean giant who rose up soon after the real man's death, but perfectly understandable within the surroundings of the teachers and contemporaries represented in another concert.</p>
        <p>This non-Beethoven program had a value in indicating how non-Beethovenian was Beethoven's environment -- though, to be sure, more music by French Revolutionary composers might have told a different story. The only big surprise -- and a surprise quite unlike any of Beethoven's -- was a highly chromatic fugue by his boyhood friend Antoine Reicha.</p>
        <p>Curiosities and new contexts, though, can take one only so far. Illumination has to come also, and principally, from performance, and here a lot of the performances were unremarkable.</p>
        <p>This was a pity. Some way needs to be found to attract musicians to Bard who will not stumble through an unusual piece -- Beethoven's D major fugue for string quintet, say -- as if they, too, are encountering it at that moment for the first time. It is also a pity that, after 10 years, these annual festival weekends have still not focused on the music of a living composer.</p>
        <p>Exceptions to the generally dull or weak level of performances came from the orchestra, which played with a lot of spirit despite the acoustically disfavoring tent in which it  had to perform, and most especially from the New York Virtuoso Singers, who sang for their director, Harold Rosenbaum, in the little choral pieces and for Leon Botstein in the Missa Solemnis.</p>
        <p>That work was the appropriate choice for the festival's grand finale. Though its stature could never be denied, it stands a little outside what  19th-century tradition authorized as Beethoven's essential output, and so has always provoked a more multifarious view of the composer. Also, it has links with many of the more obscure works heard earlier in the weekend: the canons and choral pieces, or the ''Egmont'' entr'actes, as much atmospheric as symphonic.</p>
        <p>A rousing performance ensured that the festival ended on a peak. Mr. Botstein went for quick tempos and affirmative closures of phrases, to which Mr. Rosenbaum's chorus added clear, lively counterpoint and, from the sopranos, exciting accuracy in the high lines they have to maintain. It was good to feel the work -- so much an appeal to God present in nature -- being shouted into the woods.</p>
