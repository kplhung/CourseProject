        <p>Surprising even some of his closest political associates and enraging his ultra-Orthodox opponents, Prime Minister Ehud Barak told his supporters during the weekend that he planned to push a ''civil reform'' through Parliament that, among other things, would strip the Jewish religious establishment of many privileges and powers.</p>
        <p>The unexpected announcement, coming at a time when Mr. Barak faces a fast-approaching deadline in talks with the Palestinians and several political challenges at home, left much of the country wondering about his motives.</p>
        <p>Some speculated that he was setting the scene for new elections, others that he was applying pressure on the opposition to support his dealings with the Palestinians, who have threatened to unilaterally proclaim a Palestinian state by Sept. 13 if a settlement has not been negotiated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak announced his proposal after summoning ministers and legislators from his One Israel coalition to a meeting late Saturday. He told them of a sweeping plan that would strengthen the secular nature of Israeli society at the cost of entrenched Jewish rights woven into the country's social and political fabric since its founding in 1948. Israeli commentators said that the plan posed one of the most serious political challenges ultra-Orthodox parties have faced in Israel.</p>
        <p>Among other things, Mr. Barak pledged to introduce a new constitution guaranteeing a full range of political, social and religious freedoms that would create greater equality between Jews and non-Jews. In addition, he promised to dismantle the Religious Affairs Ministry, introduce a bill to allow for civil marriages that would be beyond the control of the rabbinate, and sponsor bills promoting the status of women.</p>
        <p>He also outlined a ''comprehensive national service bill'' that would require all young Israelis, including members of ultra-Orthodox groups currently exempted from military service, to sign up for two years of nonmilitary work directed by the government. Finally, he pledged to impose a curriculum for all state-funded schools, including those run by ultra-Orthodox groups, that would include classes in subjects they have shunned, including civics, mathematics and English.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's continuing political problems were also compounded today when a second aide in his secretariat resigned. Haim Mendel-Shaked, one of Mr. Barak's old army friends, quit his administrative post as director of Mr. Barak's office. His resignation was considered a symbolic and psychological setback because Mr. Shaked had been loyal to Mr. Barak for many years. He was the second member of Mr. Barak's office to quit following the resignation last week of his own deputy, Shimon Batat.</p>
        <p>Accounts in Israeli newspapers today about Mr. Barak's weekend meeting said that many of those who attended were stunned. The accounts said this was partly because Mr. Barak kept his plans to himself before the weekend meeting, compounding complaints that he has become increasingly isolated from his top officials and ministers in the weeks leading up to, and since, the Camp David peace talks with the Palestinians that ended in deadlock last month.</p>
        <p>By forging ahead with a peace plan that offered greater concessions to the Palestinians on Jerusalem and other key issues than right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties were prepared to support, Mr. Barak in effect sacrificed his ruling coalition, which began to disintegrate before he left for Camp David. Now, with barely 40 of the 120 members of the Israeli Parliament still firmly behind him, he has taken another step, posing a challenge to the power of the religious establishment, that Israeli commentators view as politically risky and even quixotic.</p>
        <p>These commentators today offered a range of explanations for Mr. Barak's move. Some said he had abandoned hope of achieving peace with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and thus felt free to adopt domestic policies that would end any prospect of right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties that quit his coalition before Camp David agreeing to return to his government.</p>
        <p>Others said that Mr. Barak had realized that the only chance of winning support for a peace agreement rested on a realignment of Israeli politics that consolidated the power of secular forces. Still another view was that Mr. Barak, facing the probability of a new election in the next six months, and increasingly doubtful of having a peace agreement that could secure victory, had decided that his best chance rested with a bold new plan for reforming Israeli society from within.</p>
        <p>Accounts of the Saturday meeting said that it broke up in disarray, with some of Mr. Barak's closest political allies expressing grave doubts about his proposals, and others vigorous opposition. One newspaper, Yediot Ahronot, said one of the strongest dissents came from Shimon Peres, a former prime minister who won the Nobel Peace Prize for helping to initiate the 1993 Oslo accords that launched the current peace process.</p>
        <p>Newspaper commentators said the changes had no hope of passing the Parliament, where Mr. Barak's government faces a right-wing opposition galvanized by the concessions on Jerusalem and other compromises that Mr. Barak offered at Camp David. Although other prime ministers from the secular, left-wing political spectrum that Mr. Barak represents have tried and failed to achieve some of these reforms before, these critics said, none had ever sought to accomplish so much in one swoop, especially from a weak political position.</p>
