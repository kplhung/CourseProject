        <p>Bob Esquire, president of the Esquire Fitness group, was working out recently in a large New York City gym when he heard a loud pop. ''Everyone heard it,'' recalls Mr. Esquire. ''We all turned around to see what it was.'' The pop was the sound of a woman's inner thigh muscles ripping, the result of her personal trainer's overzealous efforts to stretch her out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Esquire, whose company does personal training and fitness consulting, said the trainer had recently taken a weekend stretching workshop but had scant hands-on experience. ''This is a perfect example of someone who took a little information but did not have the proper knowledge or depth of experience to apply the skills,'' Mr. Esquire said. (The injured client sued both the trainer and the club; the suit was settled out of court, Mr. Esquire said.)</p>

        <p>Bob Esquire, president of the Esquire Fitness group, was working out recently in a large New York City gym when he heard a loud pop. ''Everyone heard it,'' recalls Mr. Esquire. ''We all turned around to see what it was.'' The pop was the sound of a woman's inner thigh muscles ripping, the result of her personal trainer's overzealous efforts to stretch her out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Esquire, whose company does personal training and fitness consulting, said the trainer had recently taken a weekend stretching workshop but had scant hands-on experience. ''This is a perfect example of someone who took a little information but did not have the proper knowledge or depth of experience to apply the skills,'' Mr. Esquire said. (The injured client sued both the trainer and the club; the suit was settled out of court, Mr. Esquire said.)</p>
        <p>Although more than four million Americans use personal trainers, there are few standards governing the more than 66,000 people who make a living buffing biceps and toning pecs. The term is not legally defined and states do not require certification, minimum training or licensing. Anyone who can hoist a dumbbell and print a business card on a home computer can call him or herself a personal trainer.</p>
        <p>Dr. William Kraemer, director of the human performance laboratory at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., said few people adequately screen their personal trainers. ''And even when they do,'' he said, ''it is difficult to know what to assess.'' Some 250 organizations certify fitness professionals, but it is not always easy to know how rigorous their standards are.</p>
        <p>''Not all certifications are created equal,'' said Kevin Steele, vice president for health services and corporate accounts at 24 Hour Fitness, a national chain of health clubs.</p>
        <p>For example, while some certifications require individuals to take a stringent written and practical exam, others require little more than a signature on a check to earn a passing grade.</p>
        <p>''The best certifications are sponsored by nonprofit organizations made up of a professional membership,'' advised Dr. Kraemer. ''That means they're certifying more for professional development and to improve the quality of the industry than to enhance their bottom line.''</p>
        <p>He says that the certification exam should also be nationally recognized and standardized and that a four-year college degree should be required.</p>
        <p>Most experts agree that the American College of Sports Medicine, the American Council on Exercise and the National Strength and Conditioning Association -- the so-called big three -- are the certifications consumers should look for.</p>
        <p>''A trainer must demonstrate at least a grasp of the basics in order to pass them,'' said Mr. Esquire, who is a member of the faculty advisory board of the American Council on Exercise.</p>
        <p>The American College of Sports Medicine offers several certifications. The health fitness instructor exam is geared toward personal trainers and emphasizes cardiovascular exercise and health risk factor assessment but not weight training. The American Council on Exercise certifies trainers and class instructors. Its personal trainer exams are widely regarded as less technical, but more practical, than the health fitness instructor exam. Mr. Esquire said the National Strength and Conditioning Association's certification in strength and conditioning is considered the gold standard. It requires an in-depth knowledge of human anatomy, physiology and weight training technique.</p>
        <p>Ken Germano, executive director of the American Council on Exercise, cautioned that trainers should not dispense health or medical advice. ''The personal trainer's role is to help clients with their exercise programs,'' Mr. Germano said.</p>
        <p>Although the American Council on Exercise has a lifestyle and weight management certification, Mr. Germano said, it is not a license to prescribe or even recommend treatments, especially nutritional supplements.</p>
        <p>Beyond certification, says Dr. Kraemer, a former executive director of the National Strength and Conditioning Association, consumers should look for a trainer with a four-year degree in an exercise science discipline like physical education, exercise physiology or kinesiology, the study of how muscles move.</p>
