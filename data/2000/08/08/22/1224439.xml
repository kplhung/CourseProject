        <p>A medical doctor with a scholarly interest in pre-Columbian art appears to have pushed back the date of the earliest scientific medical illustration by several centuries with his study of bizarre two-faced ancient Mexican figurines known to art historians as the ''pretty ladies of Tlatilco.''</p>
        <p>The doctor, Gordon Bendersky, a visiting scholar in the department of history at the University of Pennsylvania, made the discovery a couple of years ago when leafing through journals and textbooks on pre-Columbian art. He noticed pictures of figurines unearthed since 1942 in Tlatilco, which is now part of Mexico City.</p>
        <p>Standing 3 to 12 inches tall, the figurines, which were created over a period of 500 years beginning in 1200 B.C., have short flipperlike arms, flaring thighs, small breasts, wasplike waists and a somewhat whimsical hairdo.</p>
        <p>A few dozen of the figurines have an even more grotesque feature -- two faces on a single head. Some have two heads on one neck and some have two heads on two necks.</p>
        <p>Art historians have long considered the two faces to be a representation of mythical beings. But, as Dr. Bendersky scanned the pages of the documents before him, he was suddenly struck by the similarities between the monstrous pretty ladies of Tlatilco and a rare congenital aberration called diprosopus that he had come across while a medical student.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bendersky's initial suspicion caused him to embark on what proved to be a two-year program of research to learn whether or not his guess could be correct.</p>
        <p>Now, he says, he is convinced he has identified ''the oldest scientifically medical images in world history.''</p>
        <p>''It was tremendously exciting to think that the Tlatilco artists appeared to be the very first to marry art with medical science,'' said Dr. Bendersky, who retired this year as professor of internal medicine at the MCP Hahnemann University School of Medicine in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>He is not alone in his enthusiasm. Robert Perlman, editor of the journal Perspectives in Biology and Medicine in which Dr. Bendersky's article on the figurines will appear in early September, said he and his peer-review panel found Dr. Bendersky's argument ''throughly convincing.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Perlman added: ''I think it was the Nobel prize-winner Albert Szent-Gyorgyi who said that discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought. That's Gordon Bendersky. Lots of people had seen these figurines before, but he was the first to think that they might represent human congenital anomalies.''</p>
        <p>Diprosopus is an exceedingly rare birth defect, with only about 85 cases reported since 1642. The condition, which invariably results in still birth, is caused by abnormal splitting of primitive fetal organs. It can result in facial duplication, heart abnormalities and duplication or complete absence of a brain. Scientists suspect that excess embroyologic tissue plays a role, and that both genetic factors and environmental stresses early in development of the embryo could be at work.</p>
        <p>After tracking down and examining hundreds of ceramic figurines and comparing them to photographic illustrations of two-faced Siamese twins, he concluded that the sculptors of ancient Tlatilco must have studied cases of diprosopus ''very thoroughly,'' as he later wrote.</p>
        <p>The sculptors, he explained, had not let their imaginations run wild with the creation of figurines with three or five faces or with faces  stacked on top of one another. Instead, they had strictly limited their ceramic models to naturally occurring diprosopus -- two faces side by side.</p>
        <p>In order to determine whether or not the Tlatilco figurines are in fact the world's oldest, Dr. Bendersky studied other ancient representations of human deformities, including the morbidly obese Paleolithic statuette, Venus of Willendorf; a six-toed statue from Ain Ghazal in Jordan; and a representation of the ancient Egyptian dwarf Seneb.</p>
        <p>Although older than the Tlatilco figurines, these objects fail to qualify as medical illustrations, Dr. Bendersky concluded. In addition to being crudely schematic rather than drawn from nature, they are portrayals of a particular deity or person who happens by chance to have an abnormality rather than being representative of a disease or deformity so as to provide diagnostic value.</p>
        <p>The result, he was able to say, was that the degree of accuracy in documenting anatomical and pathological features in a human head does not appear after the Tlatilco figurines for another 2,000 years or more until the 16th-century works of Hans Baldung Grien and Andreas Vesalius, who both did anatomical drawings based on dissected corpses.</p>
        <p>But as far as Dr. Bendersky has gone to explain the pretty ladies of Tlatilco, he has not been able to fathom their cultural meaning. What could explain the fascination of the early Mesoamericans with two-facedness? How was it possible that a prehistoric civilization that had yet to develop the wheel, metal tools, the domestication of animals and a sophisticated written language could have developed an extraordinarily acute power of scientific observation?</p>
        <p>''We don't know the answer to that,'' said Dr. Bendersky. ''The only way we might understand it would be to discover a written language used by these ancient peoples and that, I'm afraid, doesn't seem likely.''</p>
