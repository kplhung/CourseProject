        <p>Riffs interlaced into patterns and the patterns promised hypnotic immersion when Rokia Traore sang at Lincoln Center Out of Doors on Sunday afternoon. In the music of her country, Mali, the singer is the changeable, impulsive element within orderly pointillistic lattices, an individual carrying a message in a complex social order.</p>
        <p>Her gentle voice was surrounded by traditional instruments: two sizes of ngoni (lute), playing crisp banjolike notes and something like bass lines, along with a balaba (large balafon, or marimba), calabash and talking drums. Another singer, Xenia Caraibe, harmonized with Ms. Traore or sang overlapping lines that added one more layer of counterpoint. Only the guitar that Ms. Traore played in a few songs came from outside Africa.</p>

        <p>Riffs interlaced into patterns and the patterns promised hypnotic immersion when Rokia Traore sang at Lincoln Center Out of Doors on Sunday afternoon. In the music of her country, Mali, the singer is the changeable, impulsive element within orderly pointillistic lattices, an individual carrying a message in a complex social order.</p>
        <p>Her gentle voice was surrounded by traditional instruments: two sizes of ngoni (lute), playing crisp banjolike notes and something like bass lines, along with a balaba (large balafon, or marimba), calabash and talking drums. Another singer, Xenia Caraibe, harmonized with Ms. Traore or sang overlapping lines that added one more layer of counterpoint. Only the guitar that Ms. Traore played in a few songs came from outside Africa.</p>
        <p>Ms. Traore sang in Bamanan, the language she grew up speaking in southern Mali, and her melody lines used traditional five-note scales. Yet the songs were modern. They were about respect for women, about seizing the moment, about gratitude, about true love. Ms. Traore wrote them, and they are hybrids that neatly meld various regional styles. With finesse and ingenuity, she has created music that is thoroughly Malian, yet completely her own. She is 25.</p>
        <p>As a diplomat's daughter, Ms. Traore has lived in France, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Belgium; Sunday's performance completed her first North American tour. She is also a protegee of Ali Farka Toure, who made connections between Malian songs and American blues.</p>
        <p>Ms. Traore's cosmopolitan education may turn up in her melody lines, which are more symmetrical, and catchier to a Western ear, than the incantatory phrases of Malian griot songs. It's just as likely, however, that her melodies reflect the women's vocal tradition of the Wassoulou region of Mali, which has put singers like Oumou Sangare on the world-music circuit. And instead of accepting the Western world's common denominator of 4/4 time, Ms. Traore seems to prefer the triple-time 6/8 pulse, which dominates Africa's griot zone.</p>
        <p>She often sang quietly, letting the microphone capture a breathy melancholy in her voice. Yet there's no timidity in Ms. Traore; she rose to near-ululating urgency in some songs. And when she decided that she wouldn't be satisfied until the audience was dancing, she opened up to belt like a soul singer.</p>
        <p>Her light-fingered band made each patterned repetition a new pleasure.  Mamah Diabate, on the smaller ngoni, had multiple riffs for every song, reshuffling them with an improviser's timing; he could play the rippling, trilling lines of a griot, and in ''Laudi,'' he offered stately oudlike lines out of Mali's Arabic heritage.</p>
        <p>The music was always transparent. But it also jumped, particularly when Ms. Traore doubled the tempo and started a splay-legged, high-stepping dance. Malians came out of the audience to shower money on Ms. Traore and her band, taking their own part in a continuing tradition.</p>
