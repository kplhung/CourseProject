        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: TROOPS BACK -- The police said British troops would return to the streets of Belfast for the first time since September 1998 after the shooting deaths of two men in violence ascribed to rivalries between Protestant paramilitary units. The men were crossing a road when a gunman opened fire, a police spokesman said. Although loyalist groups all support British rule, they are riven by territorial, political and personality differences.</p>

        <p>CHECHNYA: REBEL ATTACKS -- Guerrillas staged dozens of attacks in a bid to disrupt voting for the region's representative in Russia's Parliament, but killed nine of their own by stumbling into a minefield, the Kremlin said. The region's president, Aslan Maskhadov, said guerrillas made 73 attacks; the Kremlin counted 47, which killed 3 Russian soldiers. Moscow officials said at least half of eligible voters turned out; the rights group Memorial said wartime conditions made the vote pointless.</p>

        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: MILOSEVIC TRAILING -- New polls show President Slobodan Milosevic lagging behind the joint candidate of 15 opposition parties for the Sept. 24 presidential election. A survey by the Institute of Social Sciences said Vojislav Kostunica, of the 15-party Democratic Opposition of Serbia bloc, would get 35 percent of the vote and Mr. Milosevic 23 percent. The institute interviewed 1,700 respondents from Serbia, excluding Kosovo. A survey by the Medium polling agency found 30 percent support for Mr. Kostunica and 25 percent for Mr. Milosevic.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: POLICE KILLINGS PROTESTED -- People gathered across the country in silent protest against the killing of two Civil Guards by a bomb believed planted by Basque rebels. In the Basque region, the police arrested five people believed to be linked to a cell of the armed separatist group E.T.A. The cell's leader and three other rebels died when explosives they were carrying denonated.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: WALL GUARD JAILED -- A former East German border guard commander, Walter Schulze, 52, was sentenced to two years and four months in prison by a Berlin court in the shooting deaths of East Germans trying to escape across the Berlin Wall. Among them was Chris Guffroy, 20, the last victim of the shoot-to-kill policy, who died on Feb. 5, 1989.</p>

        <p>ITALY: PEDOPHILIA ALERT -- A pedophilia scare has broken out after a 5-year-old Tunisian immigrant was sexually abused and stabbed to death in the northern town of Imperia and an 8-year-old Italian was sexually abused then burned alive in Bari, in the south. Alessandra Mussolini, a right-wing member of Parliament, proposed that pedophiles be chemically castrated. But the Rev. Gianni Baget Bozzo, a confidant of the center-right leader Silvio Berlusconi, dismissed it as a ''Nazi'' solution.</p>

        <p>CHILE: PINOCHET DATE SET -- The judge hearing the case against Gen. Augusto Pinochet set Oct. 9 as the date to question the former dictator and decide whether he will be tried on rights violations. Judge Juan Guzman did not specify where and how the hearing will take place. As a retired army general, Mr. Pinochet, 84, has the right to respond in writing, but Mr. Guzman has said he would rather question him in person.</p>

        <p>KASHMIR: 12 DIE IN CLASHES -- A brigadier and a colonel in the Indian Army were among 12 people killed in continuing clashes with rebels in Jammu and Kashmir, officials said. As the violence continued, shops and businesses went on strike in the summer capital, Srinagar, responding to a call by pro-Pakistan separatist guerrillas. Nearly a dozen groups are fighting Indian rule in the mainly Muslim Kashmir in a decade-old revolt that has left about 30,000 people dead.</p>

        <p>SOUTH KOREA: VETERANS PROTEST -- About 100 war veterans rallied in Seoul demanding the return of South Korean prisoners of war and civilians said to be held in North Korea. The South has given the North the names of 62 spies set to be returned on Sept. 2. Seoul has received growing criticism for failing to win a similar promise of repatriation from Pyongyang.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: CLEARED OF VIRUS -- Prosecutors dismissed all charges against a former computer college student accused of releasing the ''I love you'' virus on May 4 that crippled e-mail systems worldwide. The Department of Justice said the charges either did not apply to computer hacking, or there was insufficient evidence to back them up. Onel de Guzman acknowledged that he may have released the virus by accident but refused to say whether he was its author.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>SIERRA LEONE: REBEL REPORTED OUSTED -- The Revolutionary United Front has replaced Foday Sankoh with a new leader, Issa Sesay, the rebel group's field commander in recent months, the government announced. Mr. Sankoh has been detained in Freetown since a peace pact collapsed in May. Little is known of Mr. Sesay, who is in his 20's. The group has yet to confirm the change.</p>

        <p>ANGOLA: PEACE TALKS RULED OUT -- Despite pressure from the churches and civil society to find a peaceful solution to the country's longtime civil war, Angola's top general said the government would not negotiate with the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, left. Gen. Joao de Matos said peace could only be achieved if the military offensive continued and weakened the rebels.</p>

        <p>IRAN: PRESS CURBS CONTINUE -- Two pro-reform publishers, both women, appeared before a hard-line court to face charges of religious and political dissent, as Iran's press crackdown approaches its fifth month.
