        <p>Editorial lauds Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's choice of former correction commissioner Bernard B Kerik to replace outgoing New York City Police commissioner Howard Safir; says Kerick's management skills will come in handy in Police Department, where overtime is in need of scrutiny and department's relationship with minority community and its own officers needs rebuilding (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>With his exit from office just 15 months away, and members of his administration leaving for the private sector, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani faces the classic challenge of finding replacements who will both protect his legacy and sustain the administration's momentum through the lame-duck period. The mayor's decision to replace the outgoing New York City police commissioner, Howard Safir, with the former correction commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, fits these requirements nicely.</p>
        <p>As correction commissioner, Mr. Kerik drove down crime behind bars using some of the same policing techniques that Mr. Safir applied in the city streets. But unlike Mr. Safir, who engendered hostility among minority officers and the minority community as a whole, Mr. Kerik has cultivated an effective and harmonious relationship with those same communities.</p>

        <p>With his exit from office just 15 months away, and members of his administration leaving for the private sector, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani faces the classic challenge of finding replacements who will both protect his legacy and sustain the administration's momentum through the lame-duck period. The mayor's decision to replace the outgoing New York City police commissioner, Howard Safir, with the former correction commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, fits these requirements nicely.</p>
        <p>As correction commissioner, Mr. Kerik drove down crime behind bars using some of the same policing techniques that Mr. Safir applied in the city streets. But unlike Mr. Safir, who engendered hostility among minority officers and the minority community as a whole, Mr. Kerik has cultivated an effective and harmonious relationship with those same communities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir and his predecessor, William Bratton, drove down street crime in the city to its lowest levels since the 1960's. But the reductions came at great cost to minority New Yorkers, many of whom felt targeted by the police. Relations between the police and minorities were inflamed by several high-profile events, including the police torture of the Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the shootings of two unarmed black men, Amadou Diallo and Patrick Dorismond. Like Mayor Giuliani himself, Mr. Safir responded poorly. Instead of empathizing with public fears, he relentlessly cited statistics showing that crime and brutality complaints had dropped during his tenure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik, in his five years as a senior administrator at the Correction Department, won high praise from black and Latino correction officers -- who make up more than 70 percent of the work force. He brought to the jails a version of the Police Department's Compstat program, in which officers and resources are shifted around the system in reaction to carefully monitored crime trends. At monthly meetings he also held wardens accountable for their performance, monitoring not just crime trends but overtime and other expenditures. The jail system recorded dramatic drops in crime and overtime. Mr. Kerik's management system was cited by Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government as one of this year's most impressive innovations in local government.</p>
        <p>These skills will come in handy at 1 Police Plaza, where overtime is in need of scrutiny and the department's relationship with the minority community and its own officers needs rebuilding.</p>
