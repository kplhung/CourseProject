        <p>Offering another suggestive, but not yet conclusive, piece of evidence that birds evolved from dinosaurs, researchers have found that the microscopic bone structure of birds resembles those of the dinosaurs thought to be their ancestors.</p>
        <p>Over the last several years, Dr. John M. Rensberger of the University of Washington and Dr. Mahito Watabe of the Hayashibara Museum of Natural Sciences in Japan have been grinding down cross sections of bone to about a hundredth of an inch thick to look at the patterns of bone cells.</p>
        <p>They first examined the bones of existing creatures. ''We found a striking difference in the organization of the tiny tubes that connect the bone cells in mammals and in birds,'' said Dr. Rensberger, a professor of geological sciences and the curator of vertebrate paleontology at the university's natural history museum.</p>
        <p>In mammals, the tiny tubes that convey nutrients to bone cells are laid out in parallel lines, like the avenues of Manhattan. In birds, however, the tubes form a random pattern, more like the cracks of a dried-up lake bed.</p>
        <p>''We just immediately thought, gosh, what would the structure look like in dinosaurs?'' Dr. Rensberger said. ''If birds are derived from dinosaurs, then we would predict we would see that same structure we see in birds.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Rensberger took a bone fragment of a small theropod dinosaur in the University of Washington collection, ground it down, looked at it under the microscope and saw the same birdlike pattern.</p>
        <p>Not all dinosaur bones have the random pattern of tubes, which indicates fast-growing bone. Of the 550 fossils examined so far, only those belonging to the branch of dinosaurs known as coelurosaurs, believed to include the species most closely related to birds, share the birdlike tube pattern. Others, such as hadrosaurs, possessed bones that more closely resembled those of mammals.</p>
        <p>Other flying creatures that they have studied, like bats, do not have the birdlike bone structure.</p>
        <p>The findings were published in the Aug. 10 issue of the journal Nature.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rensberger admits that birds and coelurosaur dinosaurs may have independently evolved with the same bone structure.</p>
        <p>''That alone doesn't prove birds are derived from dinosaurs,'' he said. ''It just adds some additional structural similarities.''</p>
        <p>Initial analysis on bones of crocodiles, which some scientists have argued are closer relatives to birds than dinosaurs, is inconclusive, with portions appearing birdlike and others mammal-like.</p>
        <p>The researchers have not looked at the bones of Longisquama insignis, a feathered reptile that appeared about the same time as the earliest dinosaurs. That discovery, announced in June, was the latest challenge to the commonly held theory that birds evolved from dinosaurs.</p>
