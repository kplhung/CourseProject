        <p>Speaking in somber tones and at times struggling for words, Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor D. Sergeyev, offered a defense tonight of the military's failure to rescue the crew of the stricken nuclear submarine Kursk. In a nationally televised interview, he told Russians that the armed forces of the once-powerful Soviet empire had been ''robbed and stripped'' in the last decade and were operating on half the budget they required.</p>
        <p>After divers finally gained entry to the wreck of the nuclear submarine Kursk today and declared it flooded and its 118-member crew dead, the 68-year-old Marshal Sergeyev said he did not rule out the possibility that the military might have made mistakes in the rescue attempts.</p>
        <p>But he insisted that ''no fundamental mistakes'' had been made, and argued that foreign assistance might not have helped to save the crew.</p>
        <p>The Kursk went down in 350 feet of water after unexplained but powerful explosions sundered its hull during military exercises in the Barents Sea on Aug. 12.</p>
        <p>Russian officials are investigating whether it was involved in a collision with an unidentified vessel, or perhaps struck a World War II mine or was scuttled by some internal defect.</p>
        <p>In a day marked by expressions of remorse, confession and resolution to solve the mysteries of the sinking of one of Russia's most advanced warships, the commander of the Northern Fleet, Adm. Vyacheslav Popov, went on television to ask forgiveness. ''We lost the best submarine crew in the Northern Fleet,'' he said, adding, with eyes cast downward: ''Forgive the children. Forgive your sons. And forgive me for not bringing back your boys.''</p>
        <p>Marshal Sergeyev's remarks were less contrite, and seemed in part an attempt to quell the political storm that the incident has wreaked on the government of President Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
        <p>The authorities have been criticized for their failure to make a more timely request for Western assistance -- and for withholding or perhaps distorting information about the circumstances of the sinking and the condition of the sailors trapped in the submarine's nine compartments.</p>
        <p>And with fresh assertions that a foreign submarine was possibly involved in a collision with the Kursk, Russian officials betrayed some of the frustration and mistrust that were the hallmark of the cold war, even as an extraordinary collaboration among British, Norwegian and Russian sailors unfolded in the Arctic sea famous as a secret venue for  rival fleets.</p>
        <p>Marshal Sergeyev said that on Aug. 13, more than a day after the explosions, a second submerged object, probably a submarine, was detected lying near the Kursk. He also said Russian lookouts on two ships had observed a signal buoy, not of Russian origin, of the type Western fleets use to send emergency messages by satellite to their command bases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin, who remained on vacation at a Black Sea resort during most of the frantic rescue operation, did not appear in public today. But the marshal announced in the television interview that all submarines of the Kursk's class would stay in port until it was determined what caused the explosions that sent the ship  crashing into the seabed during missile- and torpedo-firing maneuvers.</p>
        <p>''It is not impossible that some mistakes were made,'' the marshal said, ''but it seems to me now that in the heat of the action, no fundamental mistakes were made.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, he added, ''we have to rise above emotions, and coldly and scrupulously investigate all the decisions that were made and how they were carried out,'' however ''serious the consequences.''</p>
        <p>He said ''the whole reason'' why Russia lacked lacked deep-sea-diving and rescue equipment in the Northern Fleet was the dire state of funding.</p>
        <p>Mark Kramer, a Russian specialist at the Davis Center for Russian Studies at Harvard University, agreed with this assessment. ''The navy is really in decrepit shape,'' he said. ''A lot of the best people have been leaving because they don't get paid. Only a tiny percentage of the navy is at sea at any one time.'' He added that most ships were ''in repairs or left in port to rust.''</p>
        <p>Russian sailors are paid $50 to $90 per month, and last winter, schools in naval towns reported 40-degree temperatures in classrooms because of chronic power interruptions.</p>
        <p>The end of the rescue operation today followed a day of fruitless attempts to open the rear escape hatch on the Kursk. This morning, a plan to pull the hatch off by force using a crane was deferred as Norwegian divers descended again and succeeded. They first opened the outer hatch to the escape chamber, which was flooded and held no signs of life. They then opened the inner hatch to the ninth compartment and found it flooded also. The body of a Russian sailor was reported to be just inside.</p>
        <p>''We have found that the whole submarine is full of water,'' a Norwegian military spokesman, John Epsen Lien, said in Oslo.</p>
        <p>Russia requested that Norway help recover the bodies, but the owners of the diving vessel, Stolt Offshore, said it might be too dangerous for their men to enter the ship. Russian navy officials said they would try to negotiate a contract to carry out the recovery.</p>
        <p>''We shall cooperate with the Norwegians as before,'' said Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak, chief of staff of the northern fleet.</p>
        <p>In response to criticism that Russian officials waited too long to seek Western assistance, Marshal Sergeyev said that as soon as it became apparent last Wednesday that the Russian Navy desperately needed help to open an escape hatch, he personally made the ''political decision,'' on the recommendation of Navy Commander Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, to ask for help and then informed Mr. Putin, who concurred.</p>
        <p>Marshal Sergeyev also said Russian military and civilian leaders strongly suspected that the Kursk had collided with another submarine, which suffered severe damage but eventually managed to escape.</p>
        <p>He said a submerged shape was detected lying near the Kursk about the time that Russian vessels were identifying its shattered hull, on the evening of Aug. 13 -- more than 30 hours after Western sensors detected the two explosions.</p>
        <p>Russian lookouts observed the Western signal buoy, but attempts to retrieve it failed in high seas, he said.</p>
        <p>His comments confirmed a report Friday from a Russian television correspondent, Arkady Mamontov, who said that military officials told him that the mystery buoy was green and white. Russian emergency buoys, he said, were red and white.</p>
        <p>At the same time that lookouts spotted the signal buoy, Marshal Sergeyev said, arriving Russian warships detected and ''directly observed the object itself on the bottom of the ocean that was of equal height of our submarine. This is a fact.'' Marshal Sergeyev then ordered the navy to send a ''hydrographic vessel with more powerful equipment'' to search for the mystery ship near the Kursk, ''but this object was not found.''</p>
        <p>It appeared from his remarks that in the early stages of the rescue operation, Russian Navy officials were not only organizing the attempted rescue of the Kursk crew, but also seeking a foreign submarine that they suspected in the collision.</p>
        <p>The Interfax news agency quoted an unidentified military official in Moscow today as saying that an object resembling ''the barrier of a foreign submarine tower'' had been discovered lying on the seabed less than 1,000 feet from the Kursk. The official said it was ''premature to draw any conclusions before studying the object,'' which ''may have been lying on the bed of the Barents Sea for a long time.'' But the statement offered another confirmation that the Russian military is actively scouring the seabed for evidence that might shed light on its collision theory.</p>
        <p>The American and British governments have categorically denied that any of their submarines or surface vessels were involved in a collision with the Russian vessel. But it was also apparent that both governments were withholding information under their own longstanding refusal to  comment on submarine spying operations directed at the Russian fleet.</p>
        <p>When Russian officials at NATO headquarters inquired whether ''even one ship was there where the accident took place, they told us no, there were no NATO ships there,'' the official said, adding that Russian officials had reported back that they overheard ''conversation that if this incident had happened,'' NATO officials ''would never acknowledge it.''</p>
        <p>Andrei A. Kokoshin, national security adviser to former President Boris N. Yeltsin, said in an interview today that ''there were many cases'' in the past decade ''when our submarines in the region and foreign subs were coming too close to each other and we raised complaints several times to the Americans and some other Western countries, even to the point of proposing that there should be some rules established for this kind of behavior.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kokoshin, now a member of parliament who has joined those calling for a parliamentary investigation into the sinking, said Russia owed a great debt to Norway and Britain for their help in the rescue attempts.</p>
        <p>But he added that even if the investigation proved that the Kursk was not involved in a collision, a new international agreement on submarine ''rules of conduct'' should be negotiated.</p>
