        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>At 40, I began to struggle with a succession of peculiar and debilitating symptoms: nausea, joint pain, sores on my hands, weakness in my hips and shoulders, extreme fatigue.</p>
        <p>After several months, doctors told me I had dermatomyositis, which, they explained, was simply a description of the symptoms because of an overactive immune system. They knew little else.</p>
        <p>After eight years and countless drugs, the illness finally let up. I've never completely recovered but I am visibly healthy and able to lead a normal life.</p>
        <p>The article ''Baffling Disorders Often Stem From Immune System Failure'' (Aug. 15), written 17 years after the onset of my illness, covers much the same ground and shows how relatively little progress has been made over this time.</p>
        <p>In the race for research dollars, autoimmune illness pales in comparison to cancer, AIDS and heart disease, yet countless Americans suffer from illnesses known or suspected to be autoimmune in nature.</p>
        <p>How gratifying it would be for this class of illness to be better understood, better researched, better treated and, perhaps, ultimately cured.</p>
