        <p>A front-page article on May 21 about the lack of research by major drug companies into diseases that affect impoverished Africans referred incorrectly to the discovery that the drug Eflornithine, developed as an anticancer drug, cures African sleeping sickness. It was made through research by several scientists, not by chance. A letter dated July 14 from a researcher pointing out the error was addressed to a vacationing correspondent overseas and received only yesterday.</p>
