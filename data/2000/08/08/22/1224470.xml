        <p>Johnny Miller has this theory about Tiger Woods.</p>
        <p>''Tiger is not really 24,'' said Miller, the NBC golf analyst who won the 1973 United States Open and 1976 British Open. ''He is more like 28, golf-wise, maybe 30. He was a child phenom. He's way past 24. A lot of people say he'll get a lot better, but I don't know. I think you're seeing the prime of Tiger. It may last two or three more years and after that he'll be a notch less. I could be wrong. Because if he went up another notch, it would be unfair.''</p>

        <p>Johnny Miller has this theory about Tiger Woods.</p>
        <p>''Tiger is not really 24,'' said Miller, the NBC golf analyst who won the 1973 United States Open and 1976 British Open. ''He is more like 28, golf-wise, maybe 30. He was a child phenom. He's way past 24. A lot of people say he'll get a lot better, but I don't know. I think you're seeing the prime of Tiger. It may last two or three more years and after that he'll be a notch less. I could be wrong. Because if he went up another notch, it would be unfair.''</p>
        <p>Miller watched Woods win the P.G.A. Championship on Sunday with his son, Andy, from a hotel room in Short Hills, N.J. Miller watched critically; Andy, who is playing this week at the United States Amateur Championship at the Baltusrol Golf Club, attended the Woods master class.</p>
        <p>''You can learn a lot by watching,'' Miller said. ''It's a standard Andy has to match. He has to do all the things these guys have to do. He's watched me. He has to watch Tiger. Tiger's the standard.''</p>
        <p>Assessing Woods versus all others, he added: ''It's like there's a bunch of Corvettes out there, but he's got a turbocharger. It's not really fair.''</p>
        <p>Fair or not, Woods's third major championship this year means that he has been spreading his ratings cheer equally among the networks.</p>
        <p>He has been most generous to CBS, which posted a final-round 10.0 overnight rating on Sunday, exceeding the 7.5 that ABC received from Woods's British Open victory last month and the 8.8 that NBC generated from his runaway triumph at the United States Open in June. (Each overnight rating point equals 659,000 television households.)</p>
        <p>CBS may have benefited from the Woods-Bob May slugfest, a match that ended in a three-hole playoff -- completely unlike Woods's runaway victories at the United States and British Opens and the 1997 Masters. For forcing Woods to work harder than better-known foes have, May certainly deserves the same Time magazine cover treatment that Woods got a few weeks ago.</p>
        <p>''It's the first time he came from behind to win a major, and the first time someone made him scramble to win,'' said Sean McManus, the president of CBS Sports. Because CBS carries the most golf, it benefits the most when Woods conjures his magic. At the 1997 Masters, his 12-stroke victory produced a 14.1 national rating. (A national rating point equals 1.01 million television homes.)</p>
        <p>Through the British Open, according to CBS, it has averaged a 4.7 rating in tournaments when Woods contends or leads, but a 2.7 when he is not contending or playing.</p>
        <p>For those scoring at home, that's a 74 percent Tiger Effect.</p>
        <p>For CBS, NBC and ABC, the 2000 Tiger Effect is 104 percent.</p>
        <p>Woods will continue to aid his television partners. Next weekend, he will defend his World Golf Championships-NEC Invitational title for CBS. And next Monday, he will play Sergio Garcia one on one in prime time for ABC. Last year, Woods's match against David Duval produced a 6.9 rating for ABC.</p>
        <p>As usual, Woods's P.G.A. performance steamrolled other sports on Sunday. CBS's rating got off slowly at 1:30 p.m. with a 3.3 (the world must have known that he would tee off at 2:30), but rose steadily in every half-hour until it peaked at a 17.5 during the Woods-May playoff from 7 to 7:30 p.m. At that level, albeit only for 30 minutes, the rating equaled what a top show like ''Survivor'' gets.</p>
        <p>In the New York market, only Channel 5's Yankees-Angels game, with a local 5.8 rating, came close. Even a Fox preseason football game, also on Channel 5 after the Yankees, was no match for Woods, chalking up a 2.4 rating (in spite of the allure of seeing the analyst Matt Millen play umpire, wearing a tiny camera on his cap).</p>
        <p>Peter Alliss, the ABC and BBC golf commentator, called a tournament for the BBC on Sunday before returning to his home in Surrey, England, to catch the last three holes of the P.G.A. on the telly.</p>
        <p>''I'm as riveted by him as people of the time must have been with young Tom Morris, or Harry Varden,'' he said by telephone. ''People must have been absolutely astounded by Bobby Jones, but they didn't have TV or instant coverage. He was the Tiger of the moment. But this Tiger of the moment has done so many extraordinary things that your eye has been drawn to him. He's learned more in three years than I thought anybody was capable of learning.''</p>
        <p>The standard of excellence set by Woods is so high, Alliss said, ''that if he misses a 4 or 5-foot putt, you'd fly the flags at half-mast.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Alliss said, he was astonished that the greatest challenge of Woods's four-year professional career came from Bob May, not from Ernie Els or Colin Montgomerie.</p>
        <p>''Where were all the other troubadours, all the other purple heart boys?'' he said. Miller said he noticed May's growing nervousness. ''I could see his game unraveling,'' he said. ''CBS sidestepped it, but his swing off the tee was coming apart. His tempo went from a nice pause at the top, to a pause and a double clutch. Afterward, CBS asked him if was getting tired; I think he wanted to say, 'I wanted to gag my guts out.' ''</p>
        <p>Miller cannot help but think of how he would fare, in his prime, against Woods. ''I'm not saying I'd beat him all the time, but I shot a lot of 61's, 62's and 63's,'' he said. ''I had that game in the mid-1970's. If I played well, nobody could beat me. Deep down, if I were 27 again, I'd say he's the best, but I don't know if he could beat me if I put up the numbers I did. I wouldn't be afraid.''</p>
