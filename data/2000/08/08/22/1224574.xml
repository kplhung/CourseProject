        <p>Correction of August 15 Business Day article on Pearson PLC of Britain</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article in Business Day on Aug. 15 about business deals by Pearson P.L.C. of Britain misstated the title of an executive and the unit he runs. Peter Jovanovich is chief executive of Pearson Education, not president of Pearson Publishing. The article also misspelled the name of a Pearson spokesman. He is John Fallon, not Phallon.</p>
        <p>The article also referred imprecisely to the reporting of Pearson's financial results. The company's financial statements include one-time gains and losses in profit before taxes and interest, not in operating profit.</p>
