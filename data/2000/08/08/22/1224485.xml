        <p>The federal government said yesterday that the nation's elementary and secondary schools would enroll a record 53 million students this fall, continuing a decade-long rise, and could expect that number to jump to 94 million by the end of the 21st century.</p>
        <p>The enrollment figure, released by Education Secretary Richard W. Riley, includes private and public schools and represents an increase of 239,000 students, or 0.5 percent, since last fall, and an increase of 6.6 million, or 14.1 percent, since 1990. School enrollment is expected to continue to rise slightly through 2005, to 53.5 million, and then drop slightly through 2010.</p>

        <p>The federal government said yesterday that the nation's elementary and secondary schools would enroll a record 53 million students this fall, continuing a decade-long rise, and could expect that number to jump to 94 million by the end of the 21st century.</p>
        <p>The enrollment figure, released by Education Secretary Richard W. Riley, includes private and public schools and represents an increase of 239,000 students, or 0.5 percent, since last fall, and an increase of 6.6 million, or 14.1 percent, since 1990. School enrollment is expected to continue to rise slightly through 2005, to 53.5 million, and then drop slightly through 2010.</p>
        <p>But in contrast to the baby boom -- which was followed, beginning in the early 1970's, by a fall in school enrollment that was uninterrupted for more than a decade -- the school population is expected to grow with no letup through the rest of the 21st century. Enrollment will swell steadily because of rising births and an unabated flood of immigrants, the report said, citing census projections.</p>
        <p>As graduation rates continue to climb, some colleges will be swamped by the overflow, at least in applications; college enrollment is expected to grow by 19 percent, or 2.4 million students, over the next decade.</p>
        <p>''We have a century of growth ahead of us, a crescendo of children,'' Mr. Riley said. ''America's challenge as we begin the 21st century is to make good choices now, so that we won't be overwhelmed later.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Riley issues an enrollment report at the end of each summer, his emphasis on the long view was aimed, at least in part, at the Republican Congress, which has consistently blocked President Clinton's efforts to make $25 billion in interest-free bonds available for districts to build and renovate schools. The Republicans have said such responsibility lies with school districts themselves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riley made clear that public school districts, both urban and rural, are already coping with growth at an extraordinary rate. In Las Vegas, where Mr. Riley released the report, the Clark County School District has almost doubled in the last 10 years, growing to 203,777 students from 105,054. (One of the newest schools, Irwin and Susan Molasky Junior High School, was named, appropriately, for a builder.) The Chattanooga, Tenn., schools grew at a similar rate in the last decade, to 42,292 students from 20,425. And in Greensboro, N.C., the school rolls rose to 61,154 from 23,851.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has estimated the cost of renovating and repairing existing schools at $127 billion.</p>
        <p>While every section of the country is expected to be affected by growth over the next century, Mr. Riley said that Western and Southern states would feel the increases acutely. Over the next 10 years, the public schools in Texas are projected to gain 219,000 students, an increase of 5.4 percent; California is expected to add 278,000 students, an increase of 4.6 percent.</p>
        <p>As overwhelming as the projected growth in school enrollment appears over the 21st century, it is, by percentage, smaller than that over the last 100 years.</p>
        <p>Enrollment in the nation's public and private schools grew by 36.1 million students, or 214 percent, from 1900 through 2000, compared with a projected growth of 41 million students, or 77 percent, from now to 2100.</p>
