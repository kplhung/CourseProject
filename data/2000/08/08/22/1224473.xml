        <p>Fifty years ago next month, on Sept. 23, 1950, President Harry S. Truman signed legislation to provide federal money to schools overcrowded by the children of federal workers and military personnel.</p>
        <p>Every president since then has tried to abolish the program or at least cut it to the bone. And every one has failed.</p>
        <p>They failed because every senator and most representatives in Congress have schools in their districts that receive money under the program, called impact aid, and have not been willing to let the program die.</p>
        <p>Now comes Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee for president. In a speech in Milwaukee today to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Mr. Bush proposed adding $310 million to the impact aid program, increasing the budget by more than a third.</p>
        <p>''Our men and women in service put their lives on the line to defend our freedom,'' Mr. Bush said. ''We have a special obligation to rebuild the schools that educate their children. As president, I will ensure that this obligation is met.</p>
        <p>''This funding means that thousands of students who are dependents of military personnel and attend public schools located near or on military facilities around the country will learn in better school environments.''</p>
        <p>The justification for the program has always been that school districts need compensation because the children of federal workers and people who work on military bases attend public schools that are supported by property taxes, but the federal government does not pay local taxes.</p>
        <p>That may have posed a burden in Truman's day. But for decades, budget experts have put the impact aid program in the same category as federal subsidies for the producers of honey and mohair: relics of the past that exist entirely because of pork barrel politics.</p>
        <p>The consensus of authorities who have studied the matter is that parents who work for the federal government today more than pay their own way. Most of the parents nowadays live in the community, pay property taxes and state and local sales and income taxes, and contribute to the local economy by buying goods and services.</p>
        <p>And military bases must be an economic boon to communities or they would not fight so hard to keep them when base-closings are threatened.</p>
        <p>Thomas M. Corwin, the acting deputy assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education, said today that over the years, some presidential candidates have been more eager than others to do away with the program. But Mr. Corwin said he could not think of a single one before Governor Bush who proposed expanding it.</p>
