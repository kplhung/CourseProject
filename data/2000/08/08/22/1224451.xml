        <p>Herbert Scheftel, an investor in real estate and television stations, died on Wednesday in New York. Mr. Scheftel, who lived in New York and had residences in East Hampton and Le Touquet, France, was 92.</p>
        <p>The best-known real estate project Mr. Scheftel was involved in, along with his brother, Stuart, and another partner, Alfred G. Burger, was the Pan Am building, now headquarters of the MetLife insurance company, which was built behind Grand Central Terminal on Park Avenue in 1963. The Pan Am project also involved Erwin S. Wolfson, who owned a contracting company, and several British investors. At one point, Grand Central City, as it was called, was to have had several theaters, an exhibition hall and an open-air restaurant.</p>
