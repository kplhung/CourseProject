        <p>THE creators of the long-running ''milk mustache'' campaign saw a natural connection between the need to drink milk and the hit CBS television show ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>''We always like to have a fun twist on the nutritional value of milk and the whole idea of 'Survivor' fits,'' said Kurt Graetzer, chief executive of the Milk Processor Education Program, which represents milk processors and sponsors the campaign with Dairy Management Inc., representing dairy farmers.</p>
        <p>As a result, the four remaining survivors of the show will don milk mustaches in a specially made print ad appearing tomorrow, the day the final episode of ''Survivor'' is broadcast. The headline is ''What the last remaining survivor dreams of wearing tomorrow.'' The winning survivor is to appear alone in a full page ad on Thursday in USA Today, and in newspapers and some weekly magazines over the next week or more, said Sal Taibi, account services director at Bozell New York, the True North Communications unit that created the milk mustache campaign.</p>
        <p>Like others, ranging from Reebok International to Playboy magazine, who have sought out the ''Survivor'' cast, the producer of the milk ads is trying to capitalize on the cast members' 15 minutes of fame.</p>
        <p>''It's relevant to everyone because they are in the news, and it helps us to cut through the clutter,'' said Craig Plymesser, vice president of milk marketing at Dairy Management Inc. ''We are picking up on their instant celebrityship, if you will, and using them to carry the message of milk and the calcium crisis.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the overall estimated $50 million milk mustache print campaign is intended to piggyback on celebrity and change the image of milk from wholesome to hip. Some 100 celebrities have worn mustaches in the campaign since it was introduced in 1995, Mr. Taibi said.</p>
        <p>But to keep the campaign fresh, Bozell often uses celebrities of the moment. This year Bozell ran an ad of the tennis champions and sisters Venus and Serena Williams. The ad ran the day after Venus Williams won Wimbledon, and was headlined ''Make ours doubles.'' The Dixie Chicks appeared with mustaches the day after winning a Grammy Award in March. And a milk mustache ad of the winning quarterback the day after the Super Bowl is now almost a standard.</p>
        <p>''We find it really works, it's a way, for a moment, of truly getting a blip on the awareness meter, and then what happens is that over time, people begin to recognize that milk is a drink for today's lifestyle,'' Mr.  Graetzer said.</p>
        <p>The ads may be short-lived, but their immediacy and novelty outweigh any drawbacks, Mr. Taibi said. ''On the morning after, when everyone is talking about it, we'll already have that person in an ad endorsing milk. And everyone's wondering how we did that.''</p>
        <p>And that conversation is valuable. According to BSMG, Chicago, the True North Communications unit that handles publicity for the milk campaign, some 250 television stations, The New York Times and The Associated Press did reports about the Super Bowl milk mustache ads in January. BSMG calculated that the coverage accounted for 29 million viewers or readers, based on circulation and ratings information.</p>
        <p>The publicity is all part of the program, of course. For the Super Bowl, the campaign typically runs an ad of the opposing quarterbacks of the big game on the day of the bowl, followed by an ad of the winning quarterback. BSMG interviews the quarterbacks about the advertising shoot, and then releases the interviews to TV stations to use during pre- and postgame coverage.</p>
        <p>The ads, which Bozell has dubbed its ''moments'' campaign, came about after the campaign garnered a huge windfall of publicity over an ad that featured President Clinton and his Republican opponent Bob Dole on the eve of the 1996 presidential election. Coverage of that single ad led to 189 print news articles and 36 TV reports, accounting for 107 million viewer-readers, according to BSMG.</p>
        <p>Now, Bozell has a staff of three people whose jobs resemble those of reporters more than ad people as they track the daily news for up-and- coming celebrities, and for dramatic stories like that of the Williams sisters who trained their whole lives together and then had to compete against each other at Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>While a typical celebrity ad for the milk mustache campaign could take months, from lining up a celebrity to scheduling the photo shoot, the moment's ads are turned around in a few days. Logistics are key and the entire process is lined up in advance and staged, Mr. Taibi said.</p>
        <p>For the ''Survivors'' ads, the four remaining survivors were photographed, together and separately, on a beach in Malibu on Friday. The group was paid an undisclosed standard group fee. Individuals are paid a standard $25,000 fee for a few hours work. As in sporting events, Bozell does not know who the final survivor will be, and must wait to release the proper ad for publication immediately after the show is broadcast.</p>
        <p>One big advantage of milk's ''moment'' ads is that often Bozell is catching the star on the rise. That usually means the celebrity is not yet overexposed and also less likely to turn them down. Though the mustache campaign is now so much part of the culture that Mr. Taibi said many celebrities consider being part of the campaign a validation of their status in the pop culture, stars do turn down the campaign. But so far, Bozell has never been rejected for a ''Moments'' ad, he said.</p>
        <p>Of course, the moment ads do have an element of risk.</p>
        <p>''We always have a generic ad in our back pocket, and if one of the people we have doesn't win, we'd just run that generic ad and no one would know the difference,'' he said.</p>
