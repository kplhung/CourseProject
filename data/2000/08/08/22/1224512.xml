        <p>The phrase is suddenly everywhere. In his acceptance speech last Thursday, Vice President Al Gore mentioned ''working families'' nine times. Party officials told other speakers to use the phrase, and they did, over and over. Now the Gore campaign is printing up signs with it and repeating it time and again on the road.</p>
        <p>''In the name of all the working families who are the strength and soul of America, I accept your nomination for president of the United States,'' Mr. Gore declared halfway through his 52-minute speech in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''It's about fighting for working families!'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said earlier in the night.</p>
        <p>''Imagine how strong we're going to be when we help our working families with affordable college educations and affordable health care,'' said Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo.</p>
        <p>While Democrats have been speaking to ''working families'' for years, the Gore campaign has recently latched on to the theme as a way of appealing to women. But unlike the pitch in the last two elections, directed to Volvo-driving suburban ''soccer moms,'' Mr. Gore's appeal this time is to the ''waitress mom,'' the working woman who not only juggles family and a job but also looks to the government for help in meeting the needs of her family.</p>
        <p>So as his campaign has steamed through the populist heartland in recent days, Mr. Gore has talked less about gun control and abortion rights, topics more likely to appeal to the more affluent ''soccer moms'' and more about bread-and-butter economic issues like adding a benefit to Medicare to pay for prescription drugs and shoring up Social Security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, the son of a populist Southern senator, used the ''working families'' phrase in his 1988 campaign for president. And it became popular among Democrats after the Republicans swept the Congress in 1994, and the party of the little guy needed to regroup its base.</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Gore formally began his campaign more than a year ago, he seemed more focused on busy, relatively upscale suburban parents who were snagged in traffic jams and could say good night to their children only by cell phone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore tried out the concept of ''working families'' late last year with the slogan ''Change that works for working families.'' It was noticeable for its double-barreled emphasis on work.</p>
        <p>But by that time, the threat from former Senator Bill Bradley was growing and the theme did not reflect what Mr. Gore was saying on the campaign trail. Besides, it was too clunky. The slogan, along with others like ''practical idealism,'' vanished as quickly as it appeared, as Mr. Gore slipped more naturally into combat mode with the phrase ''Stay and fight!''</p>
        <p>Then about two months ago, as Mr. Gore began drafting his speech for the convention, the phrase ''working families'' re-emerged. It came up in the normal course of the focus groups that most campaigns conduct, and advisers said it was tested with a so-called people meter, a hand-held device that test groups of consumers can use to register their reaction to products, or in this case,  to political language.</p>
        <p>''These are not new words in the dictionary,'' a top Gore strategist said. ''You hear things that the candidate says, you expose people to it, there are some things that resonate more than others, you get feedback from crowds and in the course of that, the language of the campaign begins to take shape.</p>
        <p>''There was no epiphany on these two words,'' the strategist said, ''but there was a consensus developing in recent weeks, not just on this term but that the whole program was a powerful way of speaking to the needs and concerns of the people who will decide this election.''</p>
        <p>Behind the phrase lies an entire political strategy. The phrase, along with Mr. Gore's populist fervor, marks a broad, thematic shift, intended to energize the party's base, which polls had shown to be less enthusiastic in their support of Mr. Gore than the Republican base was in supporting Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Anne Brown, 34, a schoolteacher who attended the opening rally for Mr. Gore's boat ride down the Mississippi in La Crosse, Wis., said she responded to the phrase because ''we know what he's talking about.'' Ms. Brown went to the rally with her 2-month-old daughter and her 55-year-old mother, who has lung cancer, and said she especially appreciated the Democrats' support of the Family and Medical Leave Act. ''It lets you be at home with your family as long as possible,'' she said, adding that she was leaning toward Mr. Gore for this reason.</p>
        <p>A top Gore adviser said: ''Working women in general encompass one of the largest elements of persuadable voters in this election. One of the great accomplishments of our convention was to soften up Bush's vote and expand our scope of opportunity.''</p>
        <p>There was some evidence today that Mr. Gore's approach was having some effect. Several polls showed Mr. Gore's standing among voters improved after the convention, largely because of stronger support from women. A CNN poll showed Mr. Gore beating Mr. Bush, his Republican rival, by 20 percentage points among women. It also showed Mr. Bush beating Mr. Gore by 20 percentage points among men.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign believes that getting the ear of these women is a crucial first step toward getting their vote, and that as Mr. Gore wins over lower-income voters, he can advance up the economic ladder to win higher-income voters.</p>
        <p>''They are a large bloc of voters who are anxious to see who will be their champion,'' said the Gore strategist. ''As the vice president gains more standing with more voters, others will come -- like blue collar men -- and he'll have the capacity to talk to other groups higher up in income scale, like the wired workers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's tax cuts are aimed specifically at working families -- tax credits for college tuition, day care, after-school programs, long-term health care, retirement and investments. He is offering $500 billion in tax cuts and credits over 10 years, which might seem a lot for someone who has criticized Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut, but Mr. Gore said today on the last leg of his boat trip that his own tax cuts ''will go to the right people.''</p>
        <p>A Gore adviser who helped coax the phrase ''working families'' from the focus-group stage to the candidate's lips explained its purpose this way: ''It implies we're talking about the people who really need government to be on their side, particularly the federal government, where so many programs from retirement, security and health emanate, and the federal government would be a real partner in terms of education.''</p>
        <p>The idea of getting help for education costs spoke directly to Lou Cook, 48, a mother of three, who showed up at a rally Saturday for Mr. Gore in Dubuque, Iowa. She said that her local property taxes, which pay for her public schools, were so high that she needed help. ''All of us who work for a living have to send our kids to school, pay taxes and mortgages, and we know the only way our kids are going to benefit themselves is through education,'' Ms. Cook said.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Cook and her husband together earn nearly $100,000 -- she licenses day-care centers and is studying toward her master's degree in therapy, while her husband is a lawyer -- she said she considered herself working class, and she liked the phrase ''working families.''</p>
        <p>Gore advisers said they were not worried that the phrase sent a subliminal message, as Mr. Bush has charged, that ''working families'' was code for class warfare. They said that this tack by the Bush campaign could help Mr. Gore because it steered the conversation away from whether Mr. Bush was more likable than Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''When Bush says 'class warfare,' that's a sign he's moving to our terrain,'' one Gore aide said. ''Bush wins if we talk on his terrain about 'affability.'</p>
        <p>''But if we move the argument from 'Kumbaya' '' the aide said, referring to the good vibes engendered by the Bush campaign, ''to 'fighting for working families,' Gore wins.''  THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE RALLYING CRY</p>
