        <p>ALL aboard! Feeling a little seasick? Wait until the J. J. Callis docks at Plum Island. Now we're truly queasy, especially if we've perused Nelson DeMille's best-selling novel about the place. Sinister stuff, even if it is fiction.</p>
        <p>Ignore the ferry captain's jokes about the island's mutant population: the seven-foot chicken and the toothless gorilla are just his way of getting your goat. And no, he won't turn the boat around, not when we're en route to visit Dr. David L. Huxsoll, brand-new king of the island where hoof-and-mouth disease (it ran amok and wiped out an island herd in 1978) and African swine flu are just a few of the enemies in residence.</p>
        <p>The seals and the seabirds are free to come and go with the tide, but the rules aren't so lenient for the quadruped inmates (118 at last count) at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, a mile off the North Fork of eastern Long Island. Apparently animal etiquette at this high-tech clinic comes from the low-tech Roach Motel handbook: they can check in, but they can't check out.</p>
        <p>''The animals are not volunteers,'' concedes Dr. Huxsoll, the plain-spoken veterinarian (not the Dr. Dolittle kind) and Walter Reed Army Institute alumnus (his ominous specialty: infectious diseases and bioterrorism) who has run this Department of Agriculture germ tank since June.</p>
        <p>Today he's running it while wearing a statement tie: canary yellow with hand-painted doggies, many of the beagle persuasion.</p>
        <p>A Midwesterner and a grandfatherly guy, Dr. Huxsoll, 63, admits he went with the man's best friend motif for public relations reasons. Plum Island is desperate for positive PR  now that it's trolling for $75 million in federal funds to upgrade to Biosafety Level 4, which deals in diseases that wipe out humans, not herds. Nothing like dressing in puppy mode to show that he's no mad scientist.</p>
        <p>In sad fact, he's not just a dog-lover (though he does condone their use in medical research); he's in mourning for one. He lost his beagle-terrier Sally, 17, to cancer recently, and forget about displaying scientific detachment: he's bummed.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, bonding with the doomed animals here isn't in his job description. Dr. Huxsoll, who grew up in hardscrabble circumstances -- zero money for college -- on a farm in Aurora, Ind., remembers weeping when the calves he had named and tended were sold. He also recalls eating other barnyard incumbents; it was either that or go hungry. He decided in third grade to be a veterinarian, and after he enlisted in the Army (he was No. 1 at his local draft board), the military covered his medical school bills and nudged him into immunology and virus research.</p>
        <p>Ensconced in 1990 as a professor of microbiology at Louisiana State University's veterinary medicine school, with retirement at arm's length, he didn't volunteer for this $125,000 assignment. The Agriculture Department twisted his arm, which gives him something in common with the animals, though unlike them he will presumably walk away intact and return home to Baton Rouge when his tenure ends in 2001 or 2002. Come to think of it, he's not sure when he can leave. But that would be sweating the small stuff.</p>
        <p>THE big stuff is why Dr. Huxsoll, on virus patrol from Vietnam (not his favorite Army posting, though he did save plenty of fever-ridden G.I.'s) to Malaysia (where he, his wife and their two children spent what he calls the happiest years of their life) to Iraq (he scoured for biological weapons), agreed to take the job.</p>
        <p>First thing he did was read Mr. DeMille's book ''Plum Island.'' No wonder people think his new workplace is one big lab experiment gone awry. ''I didn't finish it,'' he says, giving an irate twirl to the copper bracelet on his left wrist, worn just in case it does cure arthritis. As regards curing Plum Island's bad rep, Dr. Huxsoll, calling the current outbreak of West Nile virus a wake-up call (if a mosquito can catch us looking the other way, just think of the damage a bioterrorist could wreak), aims to be more than a folksy placebo.</p>
        <p>He's already talking about opening the island to interested citizens to prove there's nothing secret going on, that safe containment is a given and vaccines a mission. In that vein, he says, Representative Michael P. Forbes should not be sabotaging the center's offer to safely incinerate those 355 Vermont sheep that have been linked to a variant of mad-cow disease. It's the prudent way to go.</p>
        <p>Does Dr. Huxsoll enjoy killing animals? ''I don't like killing any mammals, from mouse to cow, but when we find ourselves in this kind of mess. . . . ''</p>
        <p>What kind of mess is he talking about? He says that the confirmation of just a single case of hoof-and-mouth disease in this country would shut down the export of all animal products, a $60 billion industry, within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Worse, there is bioterrorism -- like the tons of smallpox traced to the Soviets in the 80's -- which is why the center wants to upgrade its lab. ''It's taken the whole threat of biowarfare to the highest -- maybe -- security concern in the U.S. today, greater than nuclear,'' Dr. Huxsoll says. Yes, there's a global moratorium on making the stuff, but he's convinced there's cheating, convinced you can never have too many vaccines.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, 50 pigs, 20 mice, 20 guinea pigs, 10 sheep, 10 rabbits and 8 cows await martyrdom on his watch. Mr. DeMille and Mr. Forbes are welcome anytime to come find out why.</p>
