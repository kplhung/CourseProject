        <p>Steering clear of a political struggle that has stirred ethnic tensions in New York's Democratic Party, Hillary Rodham Clinton declined today to offer her backing for Representative Eliot L. Engel, a five-term Bronx Democrat who is facing a September primary challenge orchestrated by black and Hispanic leaders.</p>
        <p>''I am not getting involved in that campaign,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference in Yonkers this morning, as Mr. Engel stood, stiff and expressionless, at her side. ''This is a local situation. I'm not going to have anything to say about that.''</p>

        <p>Steering clear of a political struggle that has stirred ethnic tensions in New York's Democratic Party, Hillary Rodham Clinton declined today to offer her backing for Representative Eliot L. Engel, a five-term Bronx Democrat who is facing a September primary challenge orchestrated by black and Hispanic leaders.</p>
        <p>''I am not getting involved in that campaign,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference in Yonkers this morning, as Mr. Engel stood, stiff and expressionless, at her side. ''This is a local situation. I'm not going to have anything to say about that.''</p>
        <p>''I count both of them as friends, and I'm not going to become, you know, involved one way or another,'' said Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate for senator.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's statement today  was in keeping with a general policy of her campaign not to take sides in any primaries, even one that involves incumbents. Mr. Engel has served in Congress since 1988.</p>
        <p>But this particular Congressional contest has drawn unusual attention since Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic leader, who is a senior Hispanic leader in New York, announced that he was withdrawing his support for Mr. Engel, who is Jewish, and endorsing Larry B. Seabrook, a state senator who is black.</p>
        <p>A number of Mr. Engel's supporters and some Jewish newspapers have assailed Mr. Ramirez's decision as a stark attempt to increase the power of black and Hispanic leaders. Mr. Ramirez disputed that today, saying his decision was based on what he described as Mr. Engel's lackluster performance in Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Engel, who appeared with Mrs. Clinton at two campaign stops in lower Westchester County today, said he was not surprised by Mrs. Clinton's statement, though he made no effort to hide his disappointment. ''I'm told that she's not endorsing any race in a contested primary,'' he said. ''If it was solely my race, I would be more upset about it.''</p>
        <p>But he said Mrs. Clinton's decision to sit out this struggle was likely to complicate her already unsteady position with some Jewish voters. ''She has a lot of convincing to do in the Jewish community, and frankly, I think the fact that she's staying neutral isn't helping her,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton discussed Mr. Engel's primary challenge on a day in which she campaigned through Yonkers before coming here this evening to be the host for a fund-raiser on behalf of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion. At both stops in Yonkers, she reprised her attacks on her  opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, for his support of Republican positions backing large tax cuts and opposing strict regulation of health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton spent Sunday night at her home in Chappaqua with President Clinton and, for the first time, she said, the first dog, Buddy. She expressed particular delight at finding herself this morning at Sunnyside Manor, a community center for the elderly by the Hudson River in Yonkers. ''What a well-named place: Sunnyside!'' she said, looking out over a cramped, low-ceilinged room. ''Look at all these faces; it makes me feel so sunny!''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's attempts to avoid a discussion about Mr. Engel's race, one of the more complicated ethnic situations on New York's political landscape this year, suggest the experience Mrs. Clinton has gained since she came to New York more than a year ago, when she found herself ensnared in a number of only-in-New York ethnic political disputes.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has appeared at public events with both Mr. Seabrook and Mr. Engel, in a concerted attempt, her aides said, to appear to be evenhanded. Several Democrats said today that Mrs. Clinton would be particularly well advised not to take sides between Mr. Ramirez, the powerful Bronx leader and one of the most influential Hispanics in New York, and Mr. Engel.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Ramirez applauded Mrs. Clinton's decision to stay out of the race, and said his own abandonment of Mr. Engel, whom he has supported before, reflected his conclusion that he was an ''absentee congressman'' who had lost interest in the concerns of Bronx residents. He chastised Mr. Engel for even complaining about the turn of events.</p>
        <p>''Eliot Engel ought to stop that nonsense,'' he said. ''Take a chill pill. Relax. It's just a primary.''</p>
        <p>Still, the decision was not without risks. Mr. Engel's case has raised concern among a number of Jewish leaders, some of whom have already been less than full-throated in their support of Mrs. Clinton's campaign. And one of Mr. Ramirez's advisers said that whatever the Bronx Democrats' concerns about Mr. Engel's Congressional record, his endorsement of Mr. Seabrook was also very much intended to lay the groundwork for him to solicit the support of black Democrats for his candidate for mayor, Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Democratic leader and borough president, in next year's mayoral race.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Engel placed the blame not on Mrs. Clinton but on Mr. Ramirez. ''I accept that is the position that she's taken,'' Mr. Engel said. ''Let's face it: Robert Ramirez has browbeaten the world and threatened the world and this is the kind of boss-laded politics he runs in the Bronx. Everyone is afraid of him.''</p>
