        <p>MANHATTAN: MEETING CLOSED TO SOME  The police kept two dozen Bronx residents from attending a meeting of the City Council's land use committee yesterday. The officers feared the residents were about to enter City Hall to begin a demonstration, said Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The group wanted to attend an open meeting on 10 community gardens on city-owned Bronx lots that might be taken over to make way for housing. The residents had gathered in City Hall Park and unfurled a purple banner that read ''Save Our Gardens.'' A vote on the lots was delayed.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: HATE CRIMES BILL BACKED  Four of New York's Democratic members of Congress gathered yesterday at the offices of the American Jewish Congress to announce their pledge to help pass a federal hate crimes bill. Representatives Gary L. Ackerman, Joseph Crowley, Jerrold Nadler and Major R. Owens joined the New York State N.A.A.C.P. director, Hazel Dukes, and officials from the Jewish organization at the news conference. A White House-backed federal hate crimes bill passed the Senate 57-42 but is uncertain in the House, where 192 members are cosponsors.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: AVERAGE APPLE CROP  The state yesterday confirmed the estimate of New York apple growers that their harvest this year would be considerably lower than last year's because of weather damage. The apple crop is estimated at 1.05 billion pounds, down 17 percent from last year's 1.26 billion pounds. But last year's crop was the largest on record since 1926. A crop of about 1 billion pounds will be close to the average for the last five years, the New York Apple Association said.</p>

        <p>GREENWICH: WATER CALLED SAFE  New York State's health commissioner gulped down a glass of water at the opening of the Washington County Fair yesterday and promised that last year's E. coli outbreak need not be a worry. ''That water was good,'' said the commissioner, Dr. Antonia Novello. She said changes made in all water systems for state fairs had improved water quality. As a result of E. coli contamination at the Washington County Fair last year, a 3-year-old girl and an elderly man died and more than 1,000 people were sickened. It was the worst outbreak in state history.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>SPARTA: FEDERAL FLOOD AID  The Federal Emergency Management Agency has received more than 350 applications for aid from residents and businesses damaged by this month's flooding in northwestern New Jersey. The agency, which set up an office in Sparta over the weekend, will probably start distributing some grants in a few days, a spokesman said. The agency's average grant to New Jersey victims of Tropical Storm Floyd, which caused much more damage in the state, was $2,900.</p>

        <p>CAMDEN: RABBI'S WIFE CASE  Saying the flood of publicity made a fair trial impossible, lawyers for Rabbi Fred J. Neulander, accused of arranging his wife's death, have asked that a judge either move his trial to another part of the state or bring in a jury from elsewhere. The lawyers said there was little chance a Camden County jury would be unbiased toward the rabbi, who has been charged with paying two men to kill his wife, Carol, in their Cherry Hill home six years ago. Mrs. Neulander's slaying and the accusations against Rabbi Neulander have received widespread publicity in southern New Jersey.</p>

        <p>HACKENSACK: INQUIRY INTO DISMISSAL SOUGHT  A state legislator is asking for a state investigation of the Bergen County prosecutor's dismissal of his top deputy last week, after the deputy criticized the prosecutor. The legislator, Assemblyman Charles Zisa, a Democrat of Hackensack, said in an Aug. 18 letter to the state attorney general that Richard Muti, the first assistant county prosecutor, was fired for criticizing the prosecutor's managerial skills and his use of seized drug money to buy a building for his agency. The prosecutor, William H. Schmidt, a Republican, did not return a call for comment yesterday.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: OPEN-SPACE MONEY  Gov. John G. Rowland said yesterday that he planned to authorize an additional $6 million to help cities and towns buy and preserve open space. The governor is chairman of the State Bond Commission, which is expected to approve the money on Friday; it will be distributed to qualifying local governments by the State Department of Environmental Protection. Since Mr. Rowland established the Governor's Open Space Program two years ago, Connecticut municipalities have spent about $40 million to buy or preserve more than 14,000 acres.</p>

        <p>HADDAM: ATOMIC CLEANUP PLEDGED  The owners of the Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power station, closed since 1996, said they planned to dismantle and clean up the site so thoroughly that people could live there or eat plants grown on the land, according to a document recently filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Representatives from the Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company, the largest owner of the station, said they expected the decontamination to be finished by 2004. About $354 million is expected to be spent to meet the commission's decontamination standards.</p>
