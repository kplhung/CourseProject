        <p>John Meriwether is ready to apologize, but not ready to quit.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, high-risk strategies drove his hedge fund empire, Long-Term Capital Management, to the brink of collapse and unsettled world financial markets. Now Mr. Meriwether, 52, is struggling to raise money for a new fund and making an attempt to repair his reputation by apologizing for failed strategies. In interviews appearing yesterday in The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times, Mr. Meriwether conceded that his strategy had not worked.</p>
        <p>''Our whole approach was fundamentally flawed,'' Mr. Meriwether was quoted as saying in The Journal. ''I feel enormous remorse.''</p>
        <p>Eric Rosenfeld, one of Mr. Meriwether's past and current partners, said yesterday, ''I wish we had recognized the faults.''</p>
        <p>When asked why they were speaking out now, Mr. Rosenfeld said: ''Frankly, we thought it might be a good time to tell our story -- one that we have been telling a long time to investors. It's a point where everything has been taken care of with Long-Term and everyone paid off. Our new attitude is being more open.''</p>
        <p>The public contrition, after two years of mostly silence, comes a few weeks before the publication of a new book about Long-Term Capital by Roger Lowenstein, the journalist, titled ''When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management'' (Random House).</p>
        <p>Long-Term Capital, with several Wall Street legends and two Nobel laureates among its advisers, had $7.5 billion in assets in 1997. But bets on the direction of global bond prices went against them, draining $4 billion from the fund in nine months in 1998.</p>
        <p>The unraveling of Long-Term Capital came about in part because of Russia's default on its debt payments and by the fund's heavy use of leverage, or borrowed money, which accelerated its troubles. Ultimately, it took a consortium of 14 Wall Street firms to bail out the concern.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lowenstein describes how Mr. Meriwether and his partners wrangled with the Wall Street firms trying to rescue Long-Term Capital and how the partners, ''motivated by insatiable greed,'' ultimately lost the bulk of their personal fortunes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lowenstein's book follows another, by Nicholas Dunbar, ''Inventing Money: The Story of Long-Term Capital Management and the Legends Behind It'' (John Willey &amp; Sons) that came out earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Robert Stavis, one of Mr. Meriwether's successors as head of Salomon Brother's arbitrage group and an investor in the fund, said, ''It's been an interesting question why they haven't said anything for two years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meriwether and Mr. Rosenfeld, and several other partners, are operating as JWM Partners from Long-Term Capital's old offices in Greenwich, Conn. The Relative Value Opportunity Portfolio, as the new fund is called, is billed as a conservative version of the former fund.</p>
        <p>Conservative, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. The fund's managers say they will use less leverage, borrowing about $10 for every $1 invested, as opposed to the nearly $30 to $1 leverage that Long-Term Capital sometimes reached. The new fund also aims for returns of 15 percent a year, half the 30 percent a year sought by Long-Term Capital.</p>
        <p>The firm says it has raised $350 million to $400 million since its inception last December, well short of the $1 billion the partners would like. Institutional investors, some of them burned by Long-Term Capital, have largely stayed away.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, he's the poster child for all that's perceived wrong with hedge funds -- volatility, risk, exposure,'' said Barry Colvin, chief operating officer for Tremont Advisors, a consulting firm for the hedge fund industry, referring to Mr. Meriwether. ''This is a very hard allocation for anybody to make. If you're right, you're eking out 15 percent to 20 percent returns. If you're wrong, how stupid are you? There's a whole lot of downside.''</p>
        <p>Still, that Mr. Meriwether and Mr. Rosenfeld have raised several hundred million dollars at all is testament to either faith or folly. Many of the investors are former associates of Mr. Meriwether from the days when he ran the bond arbitrage group at Salomon Brothers, now a unit of Citigroup.</p>
        <p>''I gave them real money because I believe in what they're doing,'' said Mr. Stavis, now a partner at the venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners. He believes there might be more opportunity for their strategies now that other firms as well as Long-Term Capital have abandoned it. Basically, the new fund, like Long-Term Capital, makes sophisticated bets mostly on the convergence of the yields of similar bonds around the globe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenfeld said that the Long-Term Capital partners believed that they were well diversified because they were using different strategies in different markets around the world. But he added that they realized too late that ''there was a thread that ran through all of these trades,'' namely, that during a market crisis too many investors fled from positions they viewed as illiquid, regardless of their relative value.</p>
        <p>Clearly, there is still some confidence. JWM charges a higher fee than the normal 1 percent flat fee and 20 percent performance fee charged by most hedge funds. JWM, like Long-Term Capital, charges a 2 percent annual fee and a performance fee of 20 percent of profits. Since its beginning in December, the fund is up about 7.5 percent.</p>
