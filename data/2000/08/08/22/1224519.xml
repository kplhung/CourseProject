        <p>To Ward Off Wildfires, U.S. May Thin Forests  The Clinton administration, seeking to make public lands less susceptible to the kind of blazes that have scorched the West this summer, is weighing an approach that would remove small trees from forests, leaving the largest, most fire-resistant behind.

Four such executions have already been carried out this year, and a 32-year-old juvenile offender is set to be put to death on Thursday in Georgia.</p>
