        <p>Roger Doucette's head was spinning as he reported to work yesterday for the first time in two weeks. Like tens of thousands of other Verizon Communications employees, Mr. Doucette had gone on strike at the country's largest local telephone company. Now, as he returned to his job as a customer-assistance representative in Braintree, Mass., he weighed the consequences.</p>
        <p>First, the walkout had given him a nice raise and more benefits. Even stock options.</p>
        <p>But it had also brought a host of headaches.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doucette said he was expecting a flood of customer calls about the enormous backlog of telephone line repairs and new service orders. And there were the workplace relationships that had to be mended. Like other union workers, Mr. Doucette had walked the picket lines and joined in calling managers ''scabs,'' jeering them as they strode into the building to fill in on the grunt jobs. Union jobs.</p>
        <p>''One of the managers was crying when she was coming out, and I knew why,'' he said. ''She had been a rep for years and years. You can't avoid it and you can't let it stop you from doing what you need to do. But boy, emotionally, there is a lot of pain there. I'm so glad that part of it is over.''</p>
        <p>For tens of thousands of union workers, their managers and many customers, yesterday was a time for trying to bridge the chasms that emerged during the emotional 15-day walkout at Verizon, which was formed only this summer by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. In those two weeks, managers were taunted, repair vans were assaulted and two union workers were nearly electrocuted in Long Island when, the polic said, they tried to cut a power line they had mistaken for a telephone cable. Many customers, meanwhile, in need of new telephone service or repairs were told they would have to wait.</p>
        <p>But on Sunday night, two unions representing 86,000 workers in 12 states along the Eastern seaboard reached a contract agreement with Verizon that would cover about two-thirds of the strikers. Local unions representing the rest, who work from New Jersey to Virginia, were still trying to negotiate a new contract.</p>
        <p>Some of those workers showed up yesterday outside a half-dozen or so Verizon offices in New York, forming picket lines and forcing other union workers who were ready to return to work to make a moral decision about whether to cross those lines.</p>
        <p>Still, more than 80 percent of the strikers in New York and New England returned to their jobs, said John Bonomo, a Verizon spokesman. Under the settlement agreement, union workers did not have to report to their workplaces for another three days if they had extenuating circumstances. Of those who did show up, some talked of managers' buying them lunch, while others said they were greeted with cold silence.</p>
        <p>''Normally, after a strike, and in this situation in particular where management was working long hours, both sides are relieved,'' said Richard Hurd, a professor of labor studies at Cornell University. ''There's the potential to go back to work with feelings of good will. The only situation where there may be difficulty is if there were places where strikers were particularly vociferous in their attacks on managers.''</p>
        <p>One such site was a repair-van garage on King Street in lower Manhattan. In the opening days of the strike, a group of union workers surrounded a manager in the street and taunted him about his troubled marriage. The police later charged four of the workers with harassment.</p>
        <p>''There was a lot of tension'' on returning to work, said Rob Anderson, who spent five hours in jail last week after being arrested for the jeering. ''Managers didn't say much of anything. It was like, go to work, go to work. They gave us our toolbags. They didn't give us information on anything.''</p>
        <p>But some managers at the garage said they had a right to harbor bitter feelings about the strike. One said he had recently been pelted in the back of his head with an egg while out making a repair. His friend, who also declined to give his name, said he too had been harassed.</p>
        <p>''I didn't think highly of them before the strike,'' he said of the union members, ''and I don't think highly of them now.''</p>
        <p>The question that the strike posed to many customers was how highly they should regard Verizon. By yesterday, the company's backlog of repair orders had risen to 78,000 since the strike began on Aug. 6. It is unclear how many orders were put in before the strike and how many resulted from vandalism during the walkout, Mr. Bonomo said.</p>
        <p>Maria Belfiore, a Manhattan resident, said she had been waiting since the strike began to get her telephone repaired. She said telephone service was crucial because her son, Michael, has cerebral palsy and often injures himself.</p>
        <p>''The telephone is vital,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For workers and managers, the return to the workplace provided ample opportunities for occasionally tense encounters. At several offices. union members were working alongside managers who had filled in for strikers during the walkout. In many cases, supervisors had asked those managers to stay on yesterday in case union workers did not show up or refused to cross some of the remaining picket lines.</p>
        <p>''It was unusual to see managers reporting to your desk, and you sitting in the same cubicle with them,'' said Stephen Montgomery, who works in a bill-collecting office in Boston.</p>
        <p>At some offices, union workers tried to maintain an air of civility as they encountered managers who were still pinch-hitting in their jobs.</p>
        <p>Robert Shapiro, who usually managed computer programmers in White Plains, watched yesterday morning as union workers began straggling back into the customer assistance call center in nearby Valhalla. The workers looked over the gray cubicles they had vacated for two weeks. Then they saw the strangers. Mr. Shapiro, who had been filling in as an operator, was one of them.</p>
        <p>He half-expected a resentful glance or even a shouting match. But the workers just smiled.</p>
        <p>''The local management here seems like they're assimilating everybody into the workflow without making an issue of anything,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''And that's the way I guess it needs to be for the business to function as efficiently as possible.''</p>
        <p>But for some union workers in New York, assimilation did not come so easily. They still had to grapple with the moral implications of crossing picket lines. About 20 members of mid-Atlantic local unions, which were still negotiating for a contract, showed up yesterday morning at a Verizon office tower on Pearl Street near the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
        <p>Kenny Thompson, who tested data lines for the company, said he walked into the building after a union steward told him to report to work.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know what to do,'' he said. ''My heart told me not to do it.''</p>
        <p>At mid-afternoon, a manager was standing in the plaza trying to persuade some union workers to go into the building. One technician, John Giarrita, said he did not want to return to work because managers were filling in for some union jobs in his workplace. ''The management and craft, we don't work together,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Then the manager, who asked not to be named, offered a deal: If 5  technicians went up with him, he would cut loose 15 of the pinch-hitting managers. Mr. Giarrita mulled over this with some of his co-workers. The five men glanced around the plaza, then followed the manager through the glass doors.</p>
