        <p>A senior Clinton administration official said today that Congress was not likely to approve a landmark trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam this year. The official, Robert L. Mallett, said the administration had sent him to Hanoi to reassure Vietnamese officials, and to ''keep the drumbeat going for economic reform.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mallett, the deputy secretary of commerce, predicted that the deal, signed in Washington on July 13, would be approved by Congress eventually regardless of how many seats each party gains or loses -- or who wins the White House -- in November.

        <p>A senior Clinton administration official said today that Congress was not likely to approve a landmark trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam this year. The official, Robert L. Mallett, said the administration had sent him to Hanoi to reassure Vietnamese officials, and to ''keep the drumbeat going for economic reform.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mallett, the deputy secretary of commerce, predicted that the deal, signed in Washington on July 13, would be approved by Congress eventually regardless of how many seats each party gains or loses -- or who wins the White House -- in November. Neither Republicans nor Democrats, he said, will seek to kill an agreement that has great potential benefits for both countries.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Mallett said that carrying out the deal would be as arduous as the four years it took to hammer it out.</p>
        <p>''There has been some talk about foot-dragging in Vietnam,'' said Mr. Mallett in an interview here during a stopover on his way to Hanoi. ''If you're going to have foot-dragging, then their economy is not going to improve. Economic reform must be a front-burner issue for Vietnam.''</p>
        <p>Among the issues Mr. Mallett said he would raise with Vietnamese officials is the protection of intellectual property. Although Hanoi has passed laws protecting copyrights, he said it was not enforcing them adequately. He also plans to discuss labor conditions, which were not addressed in the trade deal but have been an issue because of Vietnam's reputation for sweatshop factories.</p>
        <p>''They cannot expect to be a member of the group of trading nations and pretend that labor doesn't matter,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Mallett was sanguine about prospects for trade between the two countries. He said American exports to Vietnam could grow to between $800 million and $1 billion a year within two years of the deal's ratification. That compares with $291 million last year, and $4 million in 1993, the year before President Clinton lifted the trade embargo.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Vietnam would gain improved access to American markets for its products, with the average tariff on Vietnamese goods falling to 3 percent from nearly 40 percent. In return, it would open itself to American banks, insurers and retailers, though on a somewhat slower timetable than in the recent trade agreement between China and the United States.</p>
        <p>The long road the China trade bill is taking through Congress is one reason the Clinton administration is unlikely to push the Vietnam pact before the end of the year. With Congress facing a crowded calendar and an impending election, administration officials said the White House was pouring its resources into winning Senate approval of permanent normal trading relations with China.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the delay, the Vietnamese government is already starting to carry out provisions of the agreement. Hanoi, for example, recently issued a license to the American International Group, a United States insurer, to sell life insurance. Under the deal, it does not have to admit wholly foreign-owned insurance companies for five years.</p>
