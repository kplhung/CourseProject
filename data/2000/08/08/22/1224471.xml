        <p>With the Republican and Democratic conventions completed, the next potentially decisive event in the presidential campaign will be the debates between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. Both camps have begun arguing over the format and number of debates. Mr. Bush's team wants to consider options other than the nationally televised one-on-one format sponsored since the late 1980's by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The obvious public interest is for Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush to have a chance to face and challenge each other directly, with questions coming from journalists or an audience of citizens. There should be at least three such debates on nationwide television in prime time, beginning as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>In some years the presidential debate commission, a nonpartisan group, has excluded third- and fourth-party candidates so that the Democratic and Republican nominees can hold a more focused exchange of their views. In 1996 this page questioned the commission's decision to exclude Ross Perot. We argued that since Mr. Perot had run a strong race in 1992 and still had a broad national standing four years later, he had the right to debate President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole. This year, however, neither Ralph Nader nor Patrick Buchanan has yet reached the status of a candidate with demonstrated national support. Should that change as the campaign progresses, the commission can respond accordingly. For now, the public deserves to see Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore lay out the substantial differences between them, without interference from third- or fourth-party candidates who have not built solid constituencies.</p>

        <p>With the Republican and Democratic conventions completed, the next potentially decisive event in the presidential campaign will be the debates between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. Both camps have begun arguing over the format and number of debates. Mr. Bush's team wants to consider options other than the nationally televised one-on-one format sponsored since the late 1980's by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The obvious public interest is for Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush to have a chance to face and challenge each other directly, with questions coming from journalists or an audience of citizens. There should be at least three such debates on nationwide television in prime time, beginning as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>In some years the presidential debate commission, a nonpartisan group, has excluded third- and fourth-party candidates so that the Democratic and Republican nominees can hold a more focused exchange of their views. In 1996 this page questioned the commission's decision to exclude Ross Perot. We argued that since Mr. Perot had run a strong race in 1992 and still had a broad national standing four years later, he had the right to debate President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole. This year, however, neither Ralph Nader nor Patrick Buchanan has yet reached the status of a candidate with demonstrated national support. Should that change as the campaign progresses, the commission can respond accordingly. For now, the public deserves to see Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore lay out the substantial differences between them, without interference from third- or fourth-party candidates who have not built solid constituencies.</p>
        <p>Since the Democrats met in Los Angeles last week, the political news for Mr. Gore has looked more favorable, and it is understandable that he would want more debates rather than fewer. Not only have the polls improved for the vice president, but they also show that the public is more inclined to favor him on the economy, Social Security, education and health. It stands to reason in Mr. Gore's camp that a debate might underscore these and other issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, on the other hand, has developed into a forceful and articulate candidate with what many voters believe are appealing leadership qualities. His confident manner could easily make up for any inability to recite facts and legislation as Mr. Gore has shown he can do. In one of those paradoxes of the so-called expectations game, the Bush team has already begun talking up Mr. Gore's well-known debating skills. Karen Hughes, the Texas governor's communications director, said over the weekend that ''we want to make sure it's not a yelling contest or something undignified.'' But her criterion should not become an excuse for the Bush camp to insist on an informal disorganized discussion in place of a a focused examination of issues, broadcast on all the television networks and allowing for plenty of time for rebuttals on either side.</p>
        <p>Though the political conventions did not draw as many viewers as they have in the past, the abrupt changes in opinion ratings show that when television devotes at least some time to the campaign, the public starts to pay attention. That is why an early start on debates, shortly after Labor Day, would be good for all candidates. Aides to Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush should meet right away with the presidential commission and agree on a format.</p>
        <p>There can be no objection to the candidates' accepting other formats sponsored by other news organizations, with discussions that include minor party candidates. But since the differences between the Republican and Democratic nominees are becoming clearer by the day, a series of universally televised debates in prime time would best educate voters, spur public interest and force the candidates to articulate why they should be elected.</p>
