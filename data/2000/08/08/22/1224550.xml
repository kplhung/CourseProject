        <p>The leading Spanish  hotel company, Sol Melia S.A., said it would buy Tryp S.A. for $326 million in cash and stock as part of its strategy to acquire more urban properties in Spain. Until now, the Majorca-based company had concentrated on resort hotels. Analysts said Sol Melia, majority owned by the Escarrer family, is also hoping to make itself more attractive for a potential merger or takeover. Sebastian Escarrer, the vice chairman, told Bloomberg News that Sol had talked to bigger chains. The deal will place Sol among the top 10 hotel chains, owning or managing more than 100,000 rooms in 410 hotels.</p>
