        <p>Six public polls conducted for news organizations since the Democratic convention have all shown Vice President Al Gore leading Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, though in two cases by only a single percentage point, a difference that is statistically insignificant.</p>
        <p>The postconvention gains for Mr. Gore were generally larger than the bounce recorded by the same polls for Mr. Bush. But the Bush gains generally fell off quickly. If Mr. Gore's also do, he will find himself trailing Mr. Bush again.</p>
        <p>Moreover, in none of the polls does Mr. Gore's lead exceed the margin of sampling error, which ranged from three to five percentage points, a fact that underlines the narrow, uncertain margins.</p>
        <p>Three of the polls were released today. A CBS News poll of 956 registered voters conducted Friday through Sunday showed Mr. Gore leading Mr. Bush, 45 percent to 44 percent, with 6 percent for Ralph Nader of the Green Party and 1 percent for Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party. A comparable poll taken two weeks earlier, just after the Republican convention, gave Mr. Bush 50 percent and Mr. Gore 34 percent. Mr. Gore had never led Mr. Bush in a CBS News or CBS News/New York Times poll this year.</p>
        <p>Kathleen A. Frankovic, director of surveys for CBS News, said the advantage for Mr. Gore extended beyond the horse-race numbers.</p>
        <p>''He improved the public's assessment of him as having strong qualities of leadership and someone who could be trusted. Over all, the favorable evaluation of Gore is now the same as that for Governor Bush,'' Ms. Frankovic said.</p>
        <p>Each is rated favorably by 45 percent of the public and unfavorably by 27 percent.</p>
        <p>Similarly, a Zogby International Poll for Reuters, conducted on the same three days among 1,004 likely voters, gave Mr. Gore a 44 percent to 41 percent lead, with 5 percent for Mr. Nader and 2 percent for Mr. Buchanan. A week earlier, the same poll had Mr. Bush up, 43 percent to 40 percent, with 7 percent for Mr. Nader and 2 percent for Mr. Buchanan. The last time a Zogby Poll showed Mr. Gore with a lead was in early February, when he had a one-point margin.</p>
        <p>An ABC News/Washington Post poll of 896 registered voters from Friday through Sunday, Mr. Gore has 46 percent to Mr. Bush's 44 percent, with 4 percent for Mr. Nader and 3 percent for Mr. Buchanan. Before the Democratic convention, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore in that poll, 48 percent to 40 percent, with 5 percent for Mr. Nader and 2 percent for Mr. Buchanan.</p>
        <p>Three polls conducted and released earlier pointed in the same direction. A Gallup poll of 697 likely voters for CNN and USA Today, taken on Friday and Saturday, had Mr. Gore leading Mr. Bush, 47 percent to 46 percent. Mr. Nader had 3 percent and Mr. Buchanan 2. One week earlier, before the Democratic convention, Mr. Bush had 55 percent, Mr. Gore 39 percent and Mr. Nader 2 percent, with less than 1 percent for Buchanan. Mr. Gore last led in one of these polls at the beginning of April.</p>
        <p>Another Friday-Saturday poll, done for Newsweek by Princeton Survey Research among 806 registered voters, gave Mr. Gore a 48 percent to 42 percent lead, with 3 percent for Mr. Nader and 1 percent for Mr. Buchanan. Eight days earlier, that poll found Mr. Bush leading, 48 percent to 38 percent, with 3 each for Mr. Nader and Mr. Buchanan.</p>
        <p>The first postconvention poll, conducted among 508 registered voters Thursday night for NBC News, showed Mr. Gore with a 46 percent to 43 percent lead over Mr. Bush, with 2 percent for Mr. Nader and 1 percent for Mr. Buchanan. Just before the convention, Peter D. Hart and Robert Teeter, who conduct the NBC polls, found Mr. Bush with 44 percent, Mr. Gore with 41 percent, Mr. Nader with 5 percent and Mr. Buchanan with 2 percent. None of their previous polls had found Mr. Gore ahead.</p>
        <p>Dr. Frankovic said the Gore bounce measured by the CBS News Poll had been exceeded only once in her polling, by Governor Bush's father. In 1988, she said, Vice President George Bush went from 17 point deficit to a 6 point lead over Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. Mr. Bush never trailed again.</p>
