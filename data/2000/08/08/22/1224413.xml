        <p>About 600,000 women a year have hysterectomies in the United States, usually only after a long and difficult consideration of the consequences.</p>
        <p>Now there is something else for them to think about: women who have had hysterectomies have a substantially higher risk of having urinary incontinence in later years, a new study reports.</p>
        <p>Writing in The Lancet, the researchers say it appears that women who have had the surgery have a 60 percent greater risk of being incontinent by the time they are 60. The onset, they said, can be well after the surgery, since most women who have hysterectomies do so in their 40's or 50's.</p>
        <p>The operation is the second most common major surgical procedure for women, said the researchers, from the University of California at San Francisco. Most of the time, it is done to treat noncancerous but painful conditions like fibroids.</p>
        <p>The researchers based their findings on a review of 12 previous studies. They said it was unclear why the incontinence set in so long after the surgery, but noted that incontinence caused by childbirth also tended to begin later.</p>
        <p>The lead author, Dr. Jeanette S. Brown, said in a statement that women contemplating hysterectomies need to weigh the difficulties of incontinence with their current levels of discomfort.</p>
