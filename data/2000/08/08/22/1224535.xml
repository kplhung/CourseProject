        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>An Aug. 20 front-page article about the improvement in standardized test scores in California suggests that Proposition 227, which eliminated bilingual education, was a success. But as the article notes, it is not clear whether dropping bilingual education was responsible for these gains because other changes may also have occurred, including increased test preparation and reduction in class sizes in the lower grades.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>An Aug. 20 front-page article about the improvement in standardized test scores in California suggests that Proposition 227, which eliminated bilingual education, was a success. But as the article notes, it is not clear whether dropping bilingual education was responsible for these gains because other changes may also have occurred, including increased test preparation and reduction in class sizes in the lower grades.</p>
        <p>A less obvious factor is selective testing. An article in The San Francisco Chronicle on July 22 documented several cases in the Bay Area in which increases in test scores coincided with decreases in the number of students tested.</p>
        <p>Controlled studies comparing groups that differed only with respect to the use of the first language have consistently shown that children in properly organized bilingual education programs acquire English at least as well and usually better than children in all-English programs.</p>
