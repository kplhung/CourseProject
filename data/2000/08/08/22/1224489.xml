        <p>For Vice President Al Gore these days, there is no devil in the details.</p>
        <p>As he finished his four-day riverboat tour of the Mississippi River with a floating seminar on tax policy -- a significant departure from the crap games that once prevailed on these waters -- Mr. Gore tried to convey once again that his political message is built on a foundation of substance.</p>
        <p>On his postconvention trip down the Mississippi, which began on Friday morning and ended here today in Mark Twain's boyhood home, Mr. Gore has underscored the theme of his policy-laden convention acceptance speech by portraying himself as the candidate of specifics.</p>
        <p>Rather than simply riding the tides of postconvention momentum, he has held a nautical forum on health insurance and given speeches on dry land about the environment and managed care. In remarks to his newly enthused crowds, he races through a laundry list of policy positions, then plants his tongue in his cheek and asks whether he is providing too much detail, whether he is being too specific.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Gore likes to be very specific about how specific he is being. ''If you don't want specifics,'' he told the crowd at a riverside rally here tonight, ''now is the time to leave.''</p>
        <p>At a rally earlier today in Quincy, Ill., Mr. Gore critiqued Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to allow a portion of Social Security payroll taxes to be invested in the private markets, and then asked: ''Where are the specifics? Where does the money come from?''</p>
        <p>''I'll give you the specifics before the election because I'm not afraid for you to know the facts of what Joe Lieberman and I are proposing,'' he said. Doing so, he said, is ''a way to respect and honor our democracy.'' Then he asked, ''Do you want specifics in this election?'' And the crowd, as always, yelled that it did.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's obsession with specifics, and his nonstop promotion of his obsession, serves a dual purpose. At one level, he is trying to draw substantive distinctions between his policy proposals and those of his Republican opponent. From health care and education to Social Security and tax cuts, Mr. Gore argues that his positions will do more than Mr. Bush's to improve the lives of middle-class Americans, who control the swing vote in this election.</p>
        <p>But at a somewhat more subliminal level, Gore aides make clear, the vice president's focus is intended to reinforce questions about Mr. Bush's intellectual heft. And so even as Mr. Gore technically sticks to his pledge not to wage personal attacks against Mr. Bush, he is able to use policy to plant doubts not only about his opponent's positions but also about his depth and acuity.</p>
        <p>It is terrain where Mr. Gore clearly feels he holds an advantage, and it reflects his campaign's effort to turn a perceived liability -- the candidate's wonkishness -- into an asset.</p>
        <p>''Rather than make apologies for giving people specifics, Gore is being proud of it,'' said Greg Simon, a senior adviser to Mr. Gore. ''The other side is trying to win on charm, but charm doesn't help you with prescription drugs or putting your kids through school.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore voiced a similar theme aboard the riverboat, the Mark Twain, as he conducted a discussion this morning on tax cuts with several area residents who had been brought aboard as props.</p>
        <p>Most of the forum consisted of an arithmetic lesson that compared Mr. Bush's call for a deep reduction in income tax rates with Mr. Gore's own proposals for tax cuts aimed at those struggling to afford college tuition, long-term care and child care.</p>
        <p>But before delving into policy, Mr. Gore said: ''I don't go for the old approach that says just give sound bites and public relations and images and that kind of thing and keep the facts hidden until after the election. I think the specifics are important.'' His comments came on a day when Mr. Gore rose early to conduct five brief network television interviews, and when he used the picturesque deck of the Mark Twain as a backdrop for a number of interviews with local television reporters.</p>
        <p>In his defense, Mr. Gore can be self-deprecating about his tactics. In an impromptu news conference aboard the riverboat today, he said he sensed from the enthusiasm of his crowds that his devotion to detail was paying off ''because people appreciate the effort to lift the tone of the campaign to substance and not just sound bites.'' Then he added with a laugh, ''Although that in itself is a sound bite.''</p>
        <p>The strategy is also driving Mr. Gore's public comments about proposed debates with Mr. Bush, who has said he would debate the vice president three times but has not said when or where.</p>
        <p>In the news conference today, Mr. Gore accused Mr. Bush of ''procrastinating,'' and said that ''the American people have a right in this day and time to be respected with an adult, intelligent discussion of what the major issues are in a give-and-take without the slick image-makers intervening.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's use of the phrase ''adult, intelligent discussion'' may or may not have been arbitrary. But his aides have been more explicit.</p>
        <p>''People are beginning to ask the question more and more,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's press secretary. ''Does George W. Bush have what it takes to be president?''</p>
        <p>For the most part, that is the message that Mr. Gore's crowds take from his speeches. ''The key point when you're specific is that you're accountable,'' said Robert E. Merrick, a 49-year-old physician who attended today's rally in Quincy. As for Mr. Bush, Dr. Merrick said, ''He certainly hasn't presented anything that would make you think he has the ability to do the job.''</p>
        <p>But at other moments on this trip, there have been doubts about exactly how much detail the public really craves. As the riverboat paused in a lock in Wisconsin on Friday, Mr. Gore stood on the top deck and exchanged small talk with several people on shore. ''Anybody have any questions on any of the issues?'' he asked. Nobody did.</p>
