        <p>A Custody Battle Rages On in Details</p>
        <p>In the long-running child-custody case involving the billionaire RONALD O. PERELMAN and his former wife, PATRICIA DUFF, yesterday was Ms. Duff's day to go over details.</p>
        <p>On the witness stand in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, she delivered a list of postdivorce problems: unhappy holidays, a pre-emptive trip to Disney World and what she called ''regressive behavior'' by their daughter, CALEIGH, now 5.</p>
        <p>The Disney World trip? Mr. Perelman took Caleigh. ''I had planned to take her to Disney World myself,'' Ms. Duff said.</p>
        <p>Thanksgiving 1997? ''Caleigh was extremely stressed, showing regressive behaviors,'' Ms. Duff said. ''She'd told me she was upset about the amount of time she was spending with her father.'' By January and February 1998, Ms. Duff said: ''She was showing a great deal of anger. She was upset, saying to me, 'I don't want to see Daddy, and I don't want to talk to Daddy.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Duff talked about the difficulty of calling Caleigh when the little girl was at Mr. Perelman's house. ''I would be put on hold for long periods of time and would be told Caleigh was unavailable,'' she testified. ''Sometimes Caleigh would be put on the phone and she would sound tense.''</p>
        <p>Under questioning by her lawyer, TOBY KLEINMAN, Ms. Duff also said that she had had difficulty arranging to talk with Caleigh over a video telephone. Mr. Perelman pulled the curtains shut in Caleigh's room, darkening the picture; on other occasions, audio problems interfered with the conversation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Duff also asserted that lack of privacy had been a problem. Caleigh, Ms. Duff told the court, had said that ''she did not have any privacy when talking with me on the phone.'' Ms. Duff added: ''She was distressed. She would say, 'Mommy, why do I have to be away from you for so long?' ''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Perelman's lawyers, CHARLES P. STILLMAN, jumped up repeatedly during Ms. Duff's testimony to raise objections, and the judge, JUSTICE EILEEN C. BRANSTEN of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, sustained many of them. ''Let's go on,'' Justice Bransten said at one point. When Ms. Kleinman cited the next-to-last paragraph of a letter Mr. Stillman had just been on his feet about, the judge said: ''No, you can't. It's not in evidence.''</p>
        <p>Dances With Apes In the Hamptons</p>
        <p>The other night, dancing on the path leading to the theater artist ROBERT WILSON'S Watermill Center -- a six-acre property in the Hamptons where he spends the summer rehearsing projects he presents the rest of the year -- were two actors in white gorilla costumes. They had been posted just past the Noguchi-like lanterns, the 3,500-year-old Stonehenge-like stones that Mr. Wilson had moved there from somewhere in the South Pacific. A woman in a long white party dress started dancing with the gorillas. ''It was priceless,'' said a man who happened by at that moment. ''It was on the fringes of being spellbinding but faintly preposterous, too.''</p>
        <p>So it went at the benefit for the center on Saturday, which drew 600 guests, including the dancing woman. At dinner under a tent, BOB COLACELLO, an organizer of the event and a protege of Andy Warhol, talked about an encounter Mr. Wilson and Mr. Warhol had had at the Factory, way back when. ''After he left, Andy Warhol said: 'Did you notice Bob Wilson barely said a word? That's because he's afraid I'll steal his ideas,' '' Mr. Colacello told the crowd.</p>
        <p>Mr. Colacello said that Mr. Wilson still had plenty of ideas and was ''building his own Bayreuth'' at the center, ''minus the nationalism.''</p>
        <p>Bayreuths need money, so there was an auction that raised more than $300,000. HEINER BASTIAN, a collector from Berlin, bought a BRICE MARDEN oil and watercolor on paper for $88,000. And the auctioneer, SIMON de PURY, sold the last item, a sculpture of an upside-down pair of women's legs with high-heel shoes by JUAN MUNOZ, to LOUISE P. BLOUIN MacBAIN, a collector. Later -- after a performance by PAUL SIMON -- Mr. de Pury and Mrs. MacBain melted into the crowd that was dancing cheek to cheek to music from the celebrity D.J., MARK RONSON.</p>
