        <p>A citizen telephoned the office of Mayor John DeStefano Jr. last week to register a complaint: There was an obscene painting hanging in the window of a small art gallery on Whalley Avenue and it ought to be removed. It was not exactly the kind of call to bother mentioning to the mayor, but in an effort to be helpful, it was passed on to Cindy Rodriguez, who handles all sorts of gripes as a public advocate.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rodriguez passed the complaint to one of Police Chief Melvin H. Wearing's secretaries. And as the message passed from hand to hand, it seemed to get more and more important.

        <p>A citizen telephoned the office of Mayor John DeStefano Jr. last week to register a complaint: There was an obscene painting hanging in the window of a small art gallery on Whalley Avenue and it ought to be removed. It was not exactly the kind of call to bother mentioning to the mayor, but in an effort to be helpful, it was passed on to Cindy Rodriguez, who handles all sorts of gripes as a public advocate.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rodriguez passed the complaint to one of Police Chief Melvin H. Wearing's secretaries. And as the message passed from hand to hand, it seemed to get more and more important. From the chief's office it went to Capt. Francisco Ortiz, director of community relations, and when it got to Sgts. Thaddeus Reddish and Whitney Epps, something clearly had to be done. After all, it came from the mayor, by way of the chief.</p>
        <p>So about 2 o'clock on Friday afternoon, the uniformed sergeants arrived at the Frame Shop and Eierweiss Gallery in the Westville section and politely asked that the painting, a 4-foot-square abstract of elderly nudes, be removed from the window.</p>
        <p>The gallery's owner, who had already been thinking of changing the window display, agreed. Still, she was alarmed that police officers were offering advice on where to hang art, especially in New Haven, a college town with a progressive reputation. So she called the artist, Alexander Kanevsky, who became piqued and suggested they notify the news media.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kanevsky, who is 40 and lives in Cheshire, Conn., grew up in Soviet Russia. ''My painting was suppressed for 20 years by my teachers in school,'' he said today. ''They said, 'If you continue with this, your future will be jail and extinction.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kanevsky said that he felt an obligation to speak about the police incident. ''I am not angry at all,'' he said. ''I think it's just curious. Should David be put in shorts to cover his genitalia? The times of the Spanish Inquisition passed a long time ago.''</p>
        <p>But in the end, it seems, the affair was the result not of Communist-style censorship but of Soviet-style bureaucratic bungling.</p>
        <p>Mayor DeStefano said today that he had not been aware of the complaint and had certainly not asked the police to respond. ''The mayor's public advocate, in trying to be responsive, used my name since people respond to it,'' he said. It was unclear why the complaint was passed to the police and not to the cultural affairs department, or was not simply discarded.</p>
        <p>Robert Kovsky, who works in the shop framing prints, said the officers had seemed hesitant, almost bashful, as if they really did not want to be there.</p>
        <p>''They said: 'We don't know how to say this. We don't know how to ask this,' '' Mr. Kovsky said today. ''They beat around the bush. They said: 'Well, it's the painting. We have had some complaints.' ''</p>
        <p>The sergeants said that a lawyer in town had made a complaint but that they were not naming names. They mentioned the mayor. They mentioned the chief. ''They asked us to take it out of the window, but they did not order us, because it offended a certain person,'' Mr. Kovsky said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kovsky said he was sure that the complaint had come from a well-connected lawyer. ''I am assuming the lawyer who was offended, he and his family, he must know the mayor personally or just runs in higher circles,'' he said. ''The officer specifically told us that this is down from the mayor's office.'' Ms. Rodriguez, the public advocate, said the complaint was made by a man who identified himself as Jeffrey Weisman. Mr. Weisman could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Mayor DeStefano said he did not know why police supervisors had concluded that art hanging in a private gallery was somehow part of their law enforcement jurisdiction. ''I think in the important things in life, the Police Department is excellent at exercising discretion,'' he said. ''I think like a lot of things in American life, when it comes to sex people get a little bit nervous and don't always respond appropriately perhaps.''</p>
        <p>Mayor DeStefano said he intended to call Mr. Kanevsky to assure him the city did not want to censor his work. ''We are going to call the painter tomorrow and offer to display the work in City Hall because that's not the business we are about,'' the mayor said.</p>
        <p>The gallery owner, Judy Eierweiss, did not respond to a phone message today, so it was unclear whether she would lend the work.</p>
        <p>Peacemaking aside, art professionals said there was reason for concern.</p>
        <p>''It just scares me when anyone says anything about taking art out of a window in any way that it is said,'' said Phyliss Satin, who owns two New Haven galleries called Wave. ''The political feeling in the country is reflected in this small incident,'' she said. ''That really saddens me because New Haven is such a culturally rich town.''</p>
        <p>Helen Kauder, who coordinates an annual art festival, said, ''I find it incredibly disturbing, and we are not about a situation here where public funds have been used.'' Public funds were at the heart of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's opposition to the ''Sensation'' exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum last year.</p>
        <p>''It's pretty alarming,'' Ms. Kauder said.</p>
