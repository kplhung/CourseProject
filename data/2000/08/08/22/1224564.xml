        <p>The Daily News will begin distributing a free evening newspaper aimed at commuters starting Sept. 12, executives said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The new paper, to be called The Daily News Express, will have a staff of about 12 reporters and will generally feature 20 pages of news and 20 pages of advertisements.</p>
        <p>Street hawkers will hand out the paper at 75 transportation points in Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn Mondays through Fridays, between 4  and 7 p.m. It will not publish on weekends. The Express will have an initial press run of 75,000.</p>
        <p>Les Goodstein, The Daily News's president, said the new paper would  focus on business coverage and late-breaking general news. ''This is an abbreviated, quick read,'' he said.</p>
        <p>This is not the newspaper's first foray into an evening publication. In 1980 it started a paper called Tonight, but shut it down after about a year because of lagging sales.</p>
