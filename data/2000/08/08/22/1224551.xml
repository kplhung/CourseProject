        <p>In a move that took creditor banks by surprise, Chung Ju Yung, the founder of the Hyundai Group, is seeking to sell his stake in its profitable automotive subsidiary, Hyundai Motor, to foreign investors. Originally, the founder had been expected to sell a large piece of his stake of Hyundai Motor, South Korea's largest automotive company, to domestic creditor banks, but they were demanding what he considered an excessive discount. Hyundai had said earlier that Mr. Chung would lower his stake in Hyundai Motor to 3 percent from 9.1 percent to help spin off South Korea's biggest automaker.</p>
