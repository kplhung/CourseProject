        <p>Beleaguered airline passengers looking for immediate relief from a summer of record delays and cancellations received scant hope today from a meeting of airline executives, labor unions, airport executives and the government.</p>
        <p>The meeting was called earlier this month by Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater to discuss ways of improving air travel in the face of a growing outcry from passengers.</p>
        <p>At a news conference after the meeting, Mr. Slater, flanked by several of the participants, announced three initiatives but admitted that none of them would have a significant effect before the fall, when air travel traditionally diminishes after the peak summer season.</p>
        <p>''The greatest accomplishment of today's meeting is this: that we have stated our shared commitment and expressed our renewed effort -- all of the participants here -- to improve our service to the American people,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Several participants said the meeting did succeed in setting a more cooperative tone between groups that had tended to blame one another for recent problems.</p>
        <p>For example, airline executives have attributed most of this summer's difficulties to stormy weather, an antiquated air traffic system and covert protests by pilots and machinists, especially at United Airlines, which has had the worst on-time performance of the major airlines.</p>
        <p>Air traffic controllers and some government officials have accused the airlines of scheduling too many flights that leave at the same times, overwhelming air traffic capacity.</p>
        <p>David Z. Plavin, the president of the Airports Council International, a trade association representing major airport operators, said, ''The thing that I found for myself that's different from anything I have ever experienced is a commitment to really pay some attention to this issue.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Plavin and others warned that there was no magic solution to an infrastructure problem that would take years to correct. ''It's an evolutionary process,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Plavin, the meeting was attended by, among others, executives from nine major airlines and eight labor unions representing virtually all airline and airport workers. Mr. Slater said he would hold another meeting next week with regional airlines and consumer advocates, who had complained that they were excluded today.</p>
        <p>Among the initiatives announced today, Mr. Slater promised to make the transportation department work more aggressively to help the airlines exchange information about practices that improve customer service. He also appointed a deputy to lead a task force that will report back to him in 90 days with ideas for improving the information about quality of service, like statistics about on-time performance and lost baggage, that the department receives from airlines and passes on to consumers.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Slater said the Federal Aviation Administration, which operates the air traffic system, had undertaken 20 initiatives to improve performance at seven ''choke points'' that are often responsible for causing delays. Many of the improvements, like redesigning air space around frequently congested cities like New York, Boston and Cleveland, will take years. But Mr. Slater said 11 of the improvements could be instituted by the end of October.</p>
        <p>Michael P. McNally, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the changes would not make much of a difference. ''Everything is a tweak,'' he said after the meeting. ''We are just trying to add a few percentage points to a system that is pretty much maxed out.''</p>
        <p>Still, he added that the meeting left him hopeful that industry players could begin a new era of cooperation.</p>
        <p>One indication of that will be how fast United can negotiate new contracts with its pilots and machinists. Part of today's meeting focused on how to speed up bargaining in the industry.</p>
        <p>Since airline workers are prohibited from striking until given permission by a federal mediator, many workers express their displeasure by refusing to fly overtime or calling in sick. United has said such protests by its pilots and mechanics have forced it to cancel thousands of flights.</p>
        <p>The unions have repeatedly denied that they have orchestrated any job actions. Asked at today's news conference about the effect the protests had had on consumers, Robert Roach Jr., vice president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said, ''Machinists never use job actions to aggravate consumers.''</p>
