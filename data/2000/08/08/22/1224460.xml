        <p>Open positions of short sales on the New York Stock Exchange slipped 1.2 percent in the most recent monthly period, the stock exchange reported yesterday.</p>
        <p>On the smaller American Stock Exchange, uncovered short sales increased 12.8 percent, according to the exchange, which is owned by the National Association of Securities Dealers.</p>
        <p>On the New York Stock Exchange, uncovered short sales totaled 4.18 billion shares for the month ended Aug. 15, compared with 4.23 billion shares for the month ended July 14. The most recent figure was equal to 1.4 percent of the total shares listed on the Big Board.</p>
        <p>Uncovered short sales totaled 197.8 million shares on the American Exchange, compared with 175.3 million shares in July.</p>
        <p>In a short sale, an investor borrows shares from a brokerage firm and sells them, hoping to buy them back at lower prices and make a profit on the difference. If the shares rise in price, the short-seller faces a loss. Uncovered short sales -- or those with open positions -- are shares that have been borrowed and sold, but not yet covered by repurchase.</p>
        <p>Large short-sale positions have long been considered an indicator of bearish sentiment among investors. But the level of short interest can fluctuate as a result of complex trading strategies involving options, futures and derivatives.</p>
