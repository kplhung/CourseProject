        <p>It is rewind time for ReplayTV, a company that makes digital video recorders. On Friday, the Mountain View, Calif., company withdrew its application for an initial public offering of stock. The offering of 8.5 million shares at $13 to $15 a share, had been simmering on the back burner since January, waiting for investor interest to rebound. Meantime, shares of Replay's main competitor, TiVo, have fallen sharply, to $18.69, after reaching a peak of $78.75 in January. Buzz Kaplin, a Replay executive, said the company wanted to sell more equity stakes, but could not do so with a pending offering. ''A number of opportunities came up, and we didn't want to be wallflowers forever,'' Mr. Kaplin said. Time Warner, NBC and Disney already own stakes in Replay.</p>
