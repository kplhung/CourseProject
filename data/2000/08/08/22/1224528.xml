        <p>Few dentists in the past have provided oral cancer exams to their patients (''Fighting Oral Cancer, by Looking for It,'' Aug. 15). But there is a major effort under way in the New York region to change this situation through the Consortium for the Prevention and Early Detection of Oral Cancer, which is offering additional training to dentists and free screenings for the public.</p>
        <p>I was impressed with the exhortation to readers to ask their dentists to include oral cancer exams in routine checkups. ''Ask your dentist'' is the consortium's slogan, and it represents the best way for patients to avoid becoming statistics.</p>
        <p>An oral cancer exam should be a nonnegotiable, must-have annual event, like a Pap smear or a mammogram. The federal initiative Healthy People 2010 has set a goal for 35 percent of the population to receive an oral cancer examination each year by 2010. With continued help, we surely can beat that target.</p>
