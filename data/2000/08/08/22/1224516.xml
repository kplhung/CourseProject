        <p>After a weekend of public ceremony and symbolic gestures before the television cameras, New York City's new police commissioner rolled up his sleeves yesterday and settled down to the mundane details of his post.</p>
        <p>The commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, was greeted by flashing cameras as he walked through the front door of 1 Police Plaza at 7:30 a.m., having been briefed by telephone on the day's crime statistics (murders are still down, as is major crime over all).</p>
        <p>Once inside headquarters, Mr. Kerik's only photo opportunity was on the 10th floor, where he posed for his identification card picture and the glossy photograph that will be distributed to the precincts. And from now on, Mr. Kerik is likely to enter the building through a back door that opens up onto the building's garage, to little if any fanfare.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik, who was until Saturday the commissioner of the city's Correction Department, spent yesterday making his way through the building, shaking hands with employees and meeting with his staff members. He fielded congratulatory telephone calls, and peppered his office with photographs of his wife and two children, an aide said. For lunch, he ate a sandwich at his desk, stealing bites between conversations with colleagues.</p>
        <p>At a 10 a.m. meeting in the commissioner's conference room, the department's executive staff members briefed Mr. Kerik on their responsibilities and current projects. (Each top staff member is expected to submit a more detailed, written report by the end of the day today.) Mr. Kerik then formally introduced himself, detailing his own career.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik hinted at his priorities and concerns when he held two executive staff members behind for private meetings with him and the new first deputy commissioner, Joseph P. Dunne: George A. Grasso, the deputy commissioner for legal matters, and Peter Abbot, the commander of administrative services, said a new spokesman for the department, Thomas Antenen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Antenen, who was a deputy commissioner to Mr. Kerik at correction, is expected to be named deputy commissioner of public information for the police. (The person in that job now, Marilyn Mode, was clearing out her office yesterday morning.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik asked Mr. Grasso to map out the various legal matters that the department faces, Mr. Antenen said. And Mr. Kerik spoke with Mr. Abbot about the quality of police precinct station houses and other facilities, and the chain of command through which repair requests are funneled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik has visited at least seven precincts since he was appointed on Saturday to succeed Howard Safir, Mr. Antenen said. He noted that at the Correction Department his boss had focused on repairing jail cells and other department property.</p>
        <p>After a brief meeting with reporters based at Police Headquarters, Mr. Kerik walked over to City Hall, where he met with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and several other officials. He was back at his desk for lunch, and spent the rest of the day juggling telephone calls and meetings inside the building. Mr. Kerik and Mr. Dunne met several times to discuss staff appointments, which will be announced in the days and weeks to come.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik left the office for the day about 5:45 p.m., when he headed to a golf course in White Plains for an outing and dinner to raise funds for the New York Law Enforcement Foundation, Mr. Antenen said. Not a golfer himself, Mr. Kerik left in his Correction Department car, flanked by two security officers.</p>
        <p>Even as the commissioner was settling in, his brief tenure was already under scrutiny. The Rev. Al Sharpton criticized Mr. Kerik and Mr. Giuliani for their visit on Sunday to a black church in East New York, Brooklyn, saying it was a ''counterfeit effort'' to show concern for minority residents.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Giuliani did not reach out in advance of this appointment,'' Mr. Sharpton said, speaking at a news conference at the Harlem offices of his National Action Network. ''He did not seek the counseling of anyone in the black and Latino community,'' he said, then he made the ''bogus trip''  to the Greater Bright Light Baptist Church.</p>
        <p>Mr. Antenen said that Mr. Kerik may pay other visits to churches in minority neighborhoods, saying, ''I know he enjoyed the service very much.''</p>
