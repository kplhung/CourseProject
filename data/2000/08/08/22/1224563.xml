        <p>AFTER a summer of so much trade talk that hovered over the city like a suffocating blanket of stale hot air, a genuine Knicks legend answered the telephone in his Manhattan apartment yesterday and sounded amazed that the biggest deal of all might go down after all.</p>
        <p>''I really didn't think it was going to happen,'' he said. ''To be honest, I thought that you guys were just selling papers.''</p>
        <p>Walt Frazier needed to be reminded that if he was traded when it wasn't about the money, then why can't Patrick Ewing be dispatched to Seattle when it apparently is?</p>
        <p>He chuckled, obviously delighted with this historical perspective, and said: ''I guess we've all seen Ewing as part of the Knicks for so long, we just assumed he would never play anyplace else. And I guess people, even me, forget that it also happened to me.''</p>
        <p>It was a long time ago, longer than I'd prefer to admit, as the dealing of Frazier to the Cleveland Cavaliers (''Cleveland, come on, man,'' is how he put it) occurred shortly before I was assigned to follow the Knicks around with a suitcase and my trusty Olivetti typewriter. I can still remember treading carefully into the Cavaliers' locker room at the Richfield Coliseum one wintry night in 1978, hoping this champion of my own adolescence, this one-time embodiment of urban chic and cool, would cough up a few quotes on life in the Cleveland 'burbs.</p>
        <p>Frazier wasn't in the best of moods, even months after being informed of the deal by his agent, who was waiting for him when he returned to his apartment late one Friday night. More than two decades later, a modern multimillionaire star like Ewing at least has the power to engineer his potential departure on more favorable terms, relative to his earning power beyond next year.</p>
        <p>If Walt Frazier couldn't finish his career in New York, please spare me any whining or wheezing about Ewing possibly moving on after 15 fruitful yet also frustrating seasons. On judgment day in the court of great players, Frazier is remembered as everything Ewing is not. He was an improvisational genius, a showman who connected with the crowd. And when his team found itself in a seventh game, the championship riding on one 1970 spring night against Wilt and the Lakers, Frazier responded with the game of his adult life.</p>
        <p>If the rough edges of this complicated four-team trade get worked out, if it is the end for Ewing in New York, no one can say the 1990's Knicks didn't spend all they could to help put him in the same position as Frazier, 30 years ago. The personnel moves weren't always the best. The surrounding players were never as good. The opposition, particularly in the person of Michael Jordan, was almost always better. But Ewing did have Game 7 in Houston, 1994, when it was he against Hakeem Olajuwon, and Ewing stood back in the fourth quarter and watched his best championship opportunity hoisted into oblivion by John Starks.</p>
        <p>The quest continued, and in the heat of the playoffs and in recent seasons under painful conditions, it seemed courageous and real. But there was always the other side of Ewing, whose stubborn streak stretched well past the limits of pride. If Ewing is to leave New York, he will go because the organization made a perfectly prudent decision not to extend a contract that is already hopelessly inflated in terms of his 38-year-old worth.</p>
        <p>Someone close to Ewing said yesterday that once the Knicks made it clear that a contract extension was not forthcoming, his immediate response was to caucus with his agent, David Falk, to plan a strategy to obtain it elsewhere. That Ewing would be willing to go to a team that is the fifth- or sixth-best in its conference speaks volumes about his primary interest at the stage of his career.</p>
        <p>Seattle plays in the conference of the most recent champions, San Antonio and Los Angeles, and of Duncan and Shaquille. But here is the catch: the Sonics did not make the playoffs two years ago and most recently lost in the first round. Seattle will not frown upon being led to the second or third round by Ewing, as was New York. It might even be appreciative enough to pay him more millions to do it again, and again.</p>
        <p>Cynicism of Ewing's motives must be tempered with those of the Knicks, who now maneuver frantically and perhaps foolishly to justify their continuous warfare on the middle-class fan. Over the past decade, ticket prices have swelled, along with the franchise player's head, as the Knicks indulged him every which way to make him happy and maintain their illusion of contention.</p>
        <p>''I was devastated when I got traded,'' Walt Frazier said. ''But you know what? It turned out better for me. People equated the Knicks' decline with my leaving, even though we were declining anyway.''</p>
        <p>Declining or retooling, the Knicks won't be Patrick Ewing's problem anymore if this deal is made, and he won't be theirs.</p>
