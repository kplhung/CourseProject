        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Charles Ogletree suggests that because blacks who have received federal judgeships have proved to be ''not ideological extremists, but respected jurists,'' Republicans must have something sinister afloat by not speeding up the confirmation process for other blacks (''Why Has the G.O.P. Kept Blacks Off Federal Courts?'', Op-Ed, Aug. 18).</p>
        <p>One would expect that anyone who rises to the federal bench can be classified as a ''respected jurist.'' But it cannot be denied that most African-Americans nominated for federal judgeships fall on the left side of the political spectrum, and any Republicans worth their salt would not nominate such a person for the federal bench. It's not about race; it's about politics.</p>
