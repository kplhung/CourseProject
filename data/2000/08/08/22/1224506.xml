        <p>If a phone circuit goes dead and no one is on the line, does it really stop carrying sound?</p>
        <p>In many ways, a similar question could be asked about the effective end to the strike against Verizon Communications. While the strike is important for Verizon, the walkout and Sunday's agreement with two-thirds of the union membership on strike probably will not have much bearing on the rest of the telecommunications industry. Even for consumers, the strike's effect can fairly be described as only minimal.</p>
        <p>As for Verizon itself, the company will continue to be penalized to the tune of billions of dollars of market value for the strength of its unions.</p>
        <p>When auto workers go on strike, cars stop rolling off assembly lines. When pilots go on strike, planes stop flying. But when phone workers go on strike, life pretty much goes on.</p>
        <p>That is because modern networks are largely automated. Incidents of vandalism cut service to a few thousand customers here and there. Two striking workers who were nearly electrocuted were accused of trying to slice a phone line on Long Island last week. But in a backhanded testament to the power of the machines, those figures paled beside the hundreds of thousands of Verizon customers who lost long-distance phone service last week when an obscure piece of equipment failed in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>By Sunday, Verizon, the company created by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of GTE, had a backlog of about 92,000  outstanding requests for repairs. That figure was perhaps twice normal, implying that about 46,000 of Verizon's 25 million customers in the strike region were having problems they would not have otherwise had.</p>
        <p>That works out to fewer than 2 of every 1,000 customers. Of course, for each of those customers one problem was one too many, and those figures do not include the thousands of people who were stymied in attempts to sign up for or change phone service.</p>
        <p>Verizon's success in serving almost all of its customers during the strike does not mean that people are unimportant in modern communications. Without the thousands of managers that filled in for the strikers, the extent of the service failures would have been far greater. A network as extensive as Verizon's requires extensive maintenance, and that requires many people.</p>
        <p>Largely, however, lower-level employees are needed because customers want to talk to people. Most customers do not want to sign up for new phone service online. Customers with billing questions want a person on the line right now -- not an e-mail response tomorrow.</p>
        <p>During the strike, Verizon's directory assistance was largely disabled because the people who answer calls were on picket lines. If voice-recognition software is ever ready for prime time, Verizon will surely prefer to lay off thousands of operators. But while Verizon's unions would certainly block such a move, consumers would probably complain, too. During the strike many consumers have borne the inconvenience of using a phone book, the mark of an old economy if ever there was one.</p>
        <p>In the big scheme of things, the effect on consumers of the strike and its partial settlement was and will be quite small. And much the same could be said of the deal's effect on the rest of the industry, even though the unions appeared to win almost everything they had asked for.</p>
        <p>For one thing, while the wrangling over the unionization of Verizon's wireless unit was viewed as a referendum on unions' power in newer industries, the deal that was reached in the end was not all that different from those already in place at some other major wireless operators.</p>
        <p>''In terms of wireless, it seems as though what they're talking about in terms of union organizing might be similar to AT&amp;T,'' said Burke Stinson, an AT&amp;T spokesman.</p>
        <p>Eric W. Rabe, a Verizon spokesman, even ventured that his company had made a better wireless deal than had SBC Communications, the No. 2 local phone company after Verizon. ''The wireless deal that we made, from the union point of view, is more restrictive than the deal SBC already had in place,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The expedited organizing that Verizon agreed to covers only a quarter of the wireless unit employees.</p>
        <p>In any case, the main reason the Verizon deal is not a harbinger for the rest of the industry is that Verizon's unions are stronger -- perhaps a lot stronger -- than those at any other phone company in the nation, largely because of Verizon's Northeastern geography.</p>
        <p>''I think that Verizon has the toughest unions, so it's very difficult to extrapolate from what happens here to the rest of the industry because Verizon is in a pretty unique position,'' said Eric Strumingher, a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber.</p>
        <p>BellSouth, Qwest, SBC, Sprint and WorldCom declined to comment on the settlement.</p>
        <p>The other companies have nothing to gain by becoming involved in what would be considered a debacle for most of them. The fact is that under Sunday's deal, with its limits on overtime and its limits on job movements, Verizon ultimately has less control over its own business than does just about any big communications carrier.</p>
        <p>''The most important thing is the pace at which they can adapt to change in the industry and innovate and capitalize on the new growth opportunities,'' Mr. Strumingher said. ''If the Bells didn't have unions, it's worth a lot.''</p>
        <p>This month, just as the strike was starting, Verizon announced new projections for its future revenue and earnings growth. Mr. Rabe said the strike and the new deal would not alter those projections.</p>
        <p>But unionization nonetheless carries a big price on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>The price of a stock is often calculated in terms of a multiple of the company's expected per-share earnings. For instance, Verizon's shares closed at about $42.81 yesterday, up about 69 cents, meaning that they are worth 14.63 times the company's expected per-share earnings of about $2.93 this year.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Strumingher said  unionization was probably costing all of the Bell companies ''at least five'' multiple points. If Verizon's stock were trading at an earnings multiple of 19.63 rather than 14.63, each share would be worth $57.44. Over all, Verizon would have a market value of about $156 billion, not the $116 billion it currently has.</p>
        <p>All else being equal, Verizon's earnings multiple probably suffers  ''a couple of points'' relative even to SBC or BellSouth, said Mr. Strumingher, because of its strong unions and the presumed drop in productivity they cause. Just two points of earnings multiple costs it about $16 billion in market value.</p>
        <p>None of this will come as a surprise to Verizon's senior management. They know it all too well. Now, there is nothing they can do about it.</p>
