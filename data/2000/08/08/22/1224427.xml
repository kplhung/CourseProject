        <p>First and Foremost</p>
        <p>When the Lake George Opera Festival makes its debut at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center Amphitheater under the direction of Daniel Beckwith on Thursday, the soprano Cynthia Lawrence will be appearing once again in one of her signature roles, the tragic Cio-Cio San in Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly.'' Ms. Lawrence sang the role at the Metropolitan Opera this year in a season that also included her debut at the Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin in Schonberg's ''Von Heute auf Morgen,'' led by Daniel Barenboim, and her debut as Lady Macbeth with Opera Colorado.</p>
        <p>Pulling Strings</p>
        <p>A one-man show with a cast of 34 begins performances at the New York Theater Workshop at 8 p.m. on Friday. The one man is the Canadian master puppeteer Ronnie Burkett. Not only did he conceive and write the show, ''Street of Blood,'' but he also created the 34 marionettes he brings to life in what is described as a prairie gothic epic about religion, celebrity worship, adoption, AIDS and contamination of the blood supply. ''Street of Blood,'' opening officially on Sept. 7 and running through Oct. 8, is part of the Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater 2000, which will present 26 productions from 14 countries starting on Sept. 6.</p>
        <p>On Rounds</p>
        <p>Spanning six centuries and four continents, a new exhibition takes the viewer from the treatment of a German plague victim in the 15th century through Florence Nightingale's military hospital in Turkey during the Crimean War to a Red Cross tent in Africa in the 1920's and the back-road rounds of Maude Callen, a black midwife in North Carolina in the 1950's. Beginning on Saturday and continuing through Oct. 29 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, ''The Nightingale's Song''  presents 80 prints, drawings and photographs from the museum's Ars Medica Collection of 2,500 items devoted to the interrelationships of medicine, pharmacy, public health and the visual arts.</p>
        <p>Casting News</p>
        <p>Out of a swimsuit and into a split personality. That's the prospect for David Hasselhoff, the star of television's ''Baywatch,'' who is to make his Broadway debut on Halloween as the star of ''Jekyll &amp; Hyde'' at the Plymouth Theater. He will replace Sebastian Bach, who is leaving the cast on Oct. 15. . . .  Cheryl Ladd, who played Kris Munroe in ''Charlie's Angels'' on television, is to take over the role of Annie Oakley from Bernadette Peters in ''Annie Get Your Gun'' for a run from Sept. 6 through Jan. 28 at the Marquis Theater. She will play opposite Patrick Cassidy, who will succeed Tom Wopat as Frank Butler.</p>
