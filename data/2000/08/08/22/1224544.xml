        <p>In the aftermath of blazes that have scorched millions of acres of Western forests this summer, the Clinton administration will try to extend nationwide an experimental effort here to reduce fire dangers by thinning small trees from forests and leaving the largest, most fire-resistant behind.</p>
        <p>One draft, being circulated by the  Forest Service as enormous fires in Montana and other states continue to burn, calls for thinning, over 15 years, most or all of the 40 million acres of national forest now deemed at high risk of catastrophic fire.</p>
        <p>The estimated cost of the plan envisioned by the draft is $825 million a year, one administration official said.</p>
        <p>The administration's reassessment of its approach to wildfires follows criticism from conservatives who say the government should have done more to combat the fire threat in the West, through emergency logging measures advocated by the timber industry.</p>
        <p>Administration officials have dismissed that accusation as politically motivated, but appear now to be moving toward broad adoption of a Flagstaff-style alternative in the hope that it will prove acceptable to both the industry and environmental groups.</p>
        <p>At least a partial version of the plan could be made public as early as next month, when Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman are to report back to President Clinton with the results of a reassessment prompted by the current fire season, which is on track to become the most devastating in decades.</p>
        <p>Administration officials have declined to specify the extent of any new effort, but they have clearly signaled an intention to expand significantly the kind of thinning already under way. They have openly expressed admiration for the experiment being attempted in the dense Ponderosa pine forests outside Flagstaff, where a broad coalition of government, industry and environmental leaders have joined forces behind a costly approach that involves the removal of many small trees while larger, more commercially valuable ones are left behind.</p>
        <p>''We really need to scale this up to a significant level,'' Mr. Babbitt said in an interview.</p>
        <p>The Flagstaff experiment was undertaken with federal support in 1998, in response to residents' concerns after forest fires in 1996 drew close to the city. At present, however, it involves only 300 acres.</p>
        <p>As evidence of the plan's promise, its architects point to what did and did not happen this June, when one of the season's big blazes swept through Ponderosa pines in a section of the Kaibab National Forest not far away. A stand of pines had previously been thinned to about 10 percent of its former density, with the largest, most fire-resistant among those left behind. As the architects had hoped, that small island was mostly spared as flames that had been leaping uncontrollably from treetop to treetop dropped to ground level when they reached the test zone.</p>
        <p>''I think we have seen from results that are on the ground, if we can reduce the density of trees, we can have a better chance of controlling the wildfires,'' Jim Golden, forest supervisor in the neighboring Coconino National Forest, said as he escorted a visitor through one test plot.</p>
        <p>But the Flagstaff initiative also illustrates the formidable hurdles that may yet lie in the way of an approach that has not fully satisfied either side in a bitter debate, and that would require that a formula be found to make possible the harvesting of unprecedented quantities of low-quality wood.</p>
        <p>So far, the most powerful opponents of the Flagstaff experiment are environmental groups that regard the effort as little more than a veil for commercial logging that they say should have no place in the national forests. And though the coalition assembled in support of the plan includes a number of environmental organizations, including the Nature Conservancy and the Grand Canyon Trust, the opponents have successfully sued to limit the total size of the test plots to hundreds of acres rather than the thousands envisioned by advocates.</p>
        <p>''We strongly oppose the project as it now stands and will litigate again to stop it,'' said Bryan Bird, executive director of the Forest Conservation Council of Santa Fe, N.M., one of several groups trying to block the next step in the experiment, which would widen the total test area to more than 5,000 acres.</p>
        <p>There is no doubt, fire experts say, that most Western forests have become dangerously overgrown and that thinning them could reduce the risk of a repetition of the current fire season. [On Monday, federal officials said that the amount of land burned by wildfires this year was already well above five million acres and that many blazes in hard-hit states like Montana and Idaho were not likely to be extinguished until the first snows.]</p>
        <p>But questions about the scope of such projects, and as a result their cost, remain a source of bitter divisions that are likely to surface even more visibly this fall, as Congress holds hearings about this summer's fires and begins to weigh any administration plan.</p>
        <p>Among the critics who have accused the administration of inaction to date is Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee. In an interview with The Seattle Times on Aug. 12, Mr. Bush said policies that had restricted logging and thinning of underbrush had ''made the forests much more dangerous to fire.''</p>
        <p>But Secretary Babbitt said the administration stood fully behind the thinning approach, and blamed legal and administrative maneuvering by the strategy's opponents for the lack of progress. ''The problem,'' Mr. Babbitt said, ''is that we keep getting jammed up, and we've just got to bust that barrier.''</p>
        <p>As presented in the draft Forest Service plan, a ''projected treatment schedule'' calls for the thinning of three million acres of Western forests a year by 2004, when the program would take full effect. Over its proposed 15-year span, the total cost of the program could top $12 billion,  administration officials said.</p>
        <p>While Congress would no doubt consider that price tag substantial, the officials said it should be compared with the cost of fighting this summer's fires, which is expected to exceed $1 billion, and with the risk of leaving Western forests in their current fire-prone condition.</p>
        <p>In large measure, that condition is an outgrowth of what most fire experts now agree were decades of mistaken policy, in which until very recently forest managers sought to extinguish virtually every wildfire. That approach has deprived most public lands of the natural cleansing that a low-intensity fire can provide, while leaving the dense forests that have resulted increasingly prone to the kind of intense, fast-moving fires that have burned so much land this season.</p>
        <p>''Future generations are going to damn us if we don't get on this in a hurry,'' one architect of the Flagstaff plan, W. Wallace Covington, a professor of forest ecology at the University of Northern Arizona, said of what he called an urgent need for wide-scale forest thinning.</p>
        <p>Dr. Covington's approach, which has led to the thinning of some experimental tracts by as much as 90 percent, aims to restore the more natural, less fire-prone condition that scholars say existed in Western forests before the vast European settlement of the late 1800's.</p>
        <p>But others argue that the extent of scientific knowledge does not yet justify so aggressive an overhaul of existing woodlands.</p>
        <p>''This approach is extreme and untested,'' said Sharon Galbreath, who heads the local chapter of the Sierra Club. ''This should not be billed as 'if you do this, you save the forests of the West.' If you do this, you might set back the forests of the West by 100 years.''</p>
        <p>At the heart of the debate over the thinning here have been arguments over how much wood should be removed and how much should be left behind, questions that bear heavily on the cost of any campaign.</p>
        <p>As timber industry officials and their allies point out, no project can come anywhere close to breaking even unless loggers are permitted to harvest large, commercially valuable trees. The industry argues that its ordinary practices are adequate to produce healthy forests, and would allow thinning to be carried out at a cost far less than is apparently being envisioned by the administration.</p>
        <p>But other experts note that many of this summer's largest fires are burning in areas that have previously been logged, and strongly defend the Flagstaff-style approach, of paying loggers several hundred dollars an acre to subsidize what little they can earn from selling the low-quality wood they are permitted to harvest.</p>
        <p>''What we're doing is the opposite of logging, in that you leave the best trees behind,'' said Brad Ack, executive director of the Grand Canyon Partnership, the coalition behind the Flagstaff plan. ''What we need to do now is to invest in our forests.''</p>
