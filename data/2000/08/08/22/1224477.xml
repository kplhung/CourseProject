        <p>Furthering a consolidation among bottlers of Pepsico beverages, the Whitman Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire PepsiAmericas Inc. for about $331.7 million in cash and stock.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the transaction, Whitman will pay $3.80 a share in cash and stock. In addition, it will assume $330 million in PepsiAmericas debt.</p>
        <p>The deal unites the second- and third-largest Pepsi bottlers in the United States. Executives at Whitman said the combined company would have 20 percent to 21 percent of the market for Pepsi products.</p>
        <p>Pepsi's largest bottler, the Pepsi Bottling Group, has about 55 percent of the market.</p>
        <p>Last year PepsiCo, which owns about 40 percent of Whitman's outstanding common stock, transferred several of its bottling franchises to Whitman. The transfer came just before the Pepsi Bottling Group went public.</p>
        <p>''The merger is a giant step forward in the consolidation of our business, which will translate into greater efficiencies and increase the likelihood that we will participate in other deals,'' Bruce Chelberg, Whitman's chief executive, said in a teleconference with reporters yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chelberg, who is 66, will step down once the transaction is completed, Whitman said. He will be succeeded by Robert Pohlad, 46, PepsiAmericas' chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>''Consolidation makes sense in terms of increased scale, but the key point is that the deal solves the management issue at Whitman,'' said Bill Pecoriello, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. ''Mr. Pohlad is well respected within the industry. And Whitman will build its management bench'' with PepsiAmericas executives.</p>
        <p>Based in Minneapolis, PepsiAmericas does business in nine states, many in the South, and in Puerto Rico. The company has annual sales of about $576 million.</p>
        <p>Although it is publicly traded, 70 percent of PepsiAmericas shares are owned by Dakota Holdings L.L.C., a private enterprise controlled by the Pohlad family.</p>
        <p>Whitman, which operates from headquarters in Rolling Meadows, Ill., produces and distributes Pepsi products in 10 central states as well as a number of foreign countries, including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Whitman has revenue of about $2.4 billion.</p>
        <p>''PepsiAmericas is not a huge company, but it is very well located relative to Whitman,'' said George Thompson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. ''The deal not only allows Whitman to increase its leverage with big food retailers, but puts the company in a position where they are the only game in town in that territory.''</p>
        <p>Consolidation among supermarket chains is a big reason both Coca-Cola and Pepsi have been seeking to cut the number of local bottlers.</p>
        <p>''There are lots and lots of very small bottlers still out there,'' said John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. ''Consolidation among both Coke and Pepsi bottlers slowed down in the last year, but I would anticipate that it will pick up over the next two to three years.''</p>
        <p>Currently, Whitman and PepsiAmericas together employ 14,700 people.</p>
        <p>Company executives spoke generally yesterday about anticipated cost savings as a result of the merger, but declined to talk about specific cuts.</p>
        <p>''There are synergies in this combination,'' Mr. Pohlad said, ''but the focus of this merger is on accelerating growth.''</p>
        <p>On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Whitman shares closed at $14.13, up 38 cents a share. Shares of PepsiAmericas fell 81 cents, to $3.94 a share.</p>
