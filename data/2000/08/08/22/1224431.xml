        <p>A Brown University student who knew she was allergic to peanuts died after dining on chili that, unbeknown to her, had been thickened with peanut butter. A friend faces the same risk if she inadvertently eats celery. A Minnesota school boy who had been playing in a field with friends barely survived being stung by angry yellow jackets. A Pennsylvania man with a known allergy to bee stings died while snorkeling after being stung by jellyfish. And a New York health care worker had to find a new career after a near-fatal reaction to the latex in surgical gloves and medical equipment.</p>
        <p>All are or were among millions of Americans at risk of developing an anaphylactic reaction, an extreme and potentially fatal allergic response. The immune system evolved to protect people from foreign organisms that could threaten their health and life.</p>
        <p>In ordinary allergies, the immune system reacts to innocent substances like pollen, dust mites or cat dander grains as if they were foreign invaders. But if allergies are a sign the immune system has run amok, anaphylaxis resembles a wildly out-of-control immunological riot. It is a systemic reaction that can kill within minutes by shutting off the airways or causing a precipitous drop in blood pressure.</p>
        <p>Allergic symptoms that can lead to anaphylaxis include itching, hives, swelling of the throat, asthma, a drop in blood pressure, irregular heart rhythm, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and loss of consciousness. If the reaction is not halted with epinephrine (adrenaline) and emergency treatment, it can be lethal.</p>
        <p>Each year, several hundred people succumb to anaphylactic attacks, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology says, because they fail to use epinephrine as a first-aid measure or fail to use it soon enough. Further deaths result when victims fail to seek professional medical help after using epinephrine, which suppresses the attack for only about 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>An estimated 1 percent to 2 percent of the population risks anaphylaxis from foods or insect stings alone. Others may be affected by penicillin or sulfa drugs, fish and shellfish, milk, soy, wheat, eggs or sulfites used as preservatives. And some experts say that as many as 62 million people could be at risk.</p>
        <p>While children often outgrow allergies to milk, soy and eggs, allergic reactions to peanuts, tree nuts and shellfish tend to be lifelong. People with asthma, those who are highly allergic or who suffered a previous anaphylactic attack are especially vulnerable to future anaphylaxis.</p>
        <p>Step One: Prevent Exposure</p>
        <p>Avoiding the offending substance is by far the best way to cope with a possible anaphylactic attack. Anaphylactic reactions don't result from a first-time exposure, and most people experience a warning reaction that clues them in to their vulnerability. After eating a few walnuts, for example, their mouths may feel itchy and their throats a little tight. Or after being stung by a bee or wasp they may develop a more widespread reaction than just local swelling, pain or itchiness. Such reactions are warnings that the next exposure could be lethal.</p>
        <p>People with serious food allergies must be extremely careful about what they eat. They must learn all the different names or descriptors applied to the food to which they are sensitive and must check labels on packaged foods to be sure that food was not included in any form. Eating out can be very risky. While they may ask the food server if the dish they are considering contains nuts, a nut oil might have been used in preparing it and that may not be mentioned. Some people are so sensitive that simply inhaling invisible airborne particles from someone else's meal or snack could precipitate an attack, which is why some airlines have decided to stop serving peanuts.</p>
        <p>People who have experienced an allergic reaction to the venom from an insect sting have a 30 percent to 60 percent chance of suffering a similar or worse reaction the next time they are stung. Since insect stings are likely to occur when a person is far from medical care, avoiding being stung is especially critical. This means wearing protective light-colored clothing during activities that could expose them to stinging insects, wearing shoes outdoors, keeping food and garbage covered and letting someone else dump the garbage, and not using scented detergent, shampoo, conditioner, hairspray, body lotion, lipstick or any cologne. It may also be advisable to stay out of waters that harbor jellyfish because there is sometimes a cross-reaction between the stings of jellyfish and insects.</p>
        <p>For those who know they are allergic to insect stings, immunotherapy through injections of tiny doses of the offending venom is now possible and up to 97 percent effective. Immunotherapy should be administered only by a board-certified allergist with proper emergency equipment at hand.</p>
        <p>Half a million people each year experience an allergic reaction to medications administered in hospitals, and many more cases occur outside hospitals. Penicillin and its derivatives are the main culprits, accounting for as many as three-fourths of the documented deaths from anaphylaxis in the United States and occurring mostly in people with no history of allergic reactions to penicillin. They may have become sensitized by previous treatment or even by eating meat or poultry from animals that had been treated with antibiotics. Other drugs that can cause anaphylaxis include sulfa drugs, allopurinol, medications for seizures and abnormal heart rhythms, muscle relaxants and even nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen. Sometimes vaccines, antihypertensive drugs, insulin, blood products and dyes used in X-ray examinations cause anaphylaxis.</p>
        <p>Anyone who experiences an allergic reaction to a medication should find out what drug was the likely cause and what class of medications it belongs to because other drugs in that class may have the same effect. Then they must be sure to tell every medical and dental practitioner about their drug allergy. They would also be wise always to wear a medical identification bracelet to inform medical personnel of their allergy if they are unable to communicate.</p>
        <p>Latex allergy has skyrocketed with the increased use of protective gloves by members of the health professions and possibly with the wider use of condoms and dental dams to prevent transmission of AIDS and hepatitis. While repeated professional exposure is the most common precipitant of latex anaphylaxis, sometimes patients who have had multiple operations are also at risk. To reduce the chance of becoming sensitized to latex, buy lined gloves for household chores and avoid using powder or cornstarch on rubber gloves or applying an oil-based hand lotion. Wear a medical identification bracelet and inform all medical and dental personnel before treatment.</p>
        <p>Lifesaving Treatment</p>
        <p>Epinephrine should be injected at the very first inkling of a severe allergic reaction, because anaphylaxis can kill in minutes. Taking an antihistamine is not adequate to stem a potential anaphylactic attack, and waiting until you are sure the attack is life-threatening can mean waiting until it is too late. Thus, everyone who is at risk of anaphylaxis should carry a ready-to-use syringe of epinephrine at all times (or, in the case of a small child, it should always be carried by an accompanying caretaker, teacher or counselor). An allergic person's family members, friends and, in the case of children, teachers and caretakers should know how and when to administer it.</p>
        <p>There are two versions of self-injectable epinephrine; both require a doctor's prescription. The Epi-Pen and Epi-Pen Jr. (for children weighing 22 to 45 pounds) is a spring-loaded auto-injector that, when placed against the outer thigh, even through clothing, injects a dose of epinephrine. Each pen contains one dose. Epi-Pens are made by Dey Laboratories in Napa, Calif. The second device, Ana-Kit by Bayer Laboratories in Spokane, Wash., is a preloaded syringe that can deliver two injections.</p>
        <p>Epinephrine counters anaphylaxis by relaxing respiratory muscles, constricting blood vessels, stimulating the heart and reducing swelling. Each dose lasts only 10 to 20 minutes. It is a first-aid measure only, not a replacement for professional medical care, which should be obtained on an emergency basis. As many as one-quarter of people who experience anaphylaxis will have a recurrence of life-threatening symptoms within hours of the first attack. Thus, further treatment with antihistamines and other medications is often necessary.</p>
        <p>Side effects of epinephrine include palpitations, rapid heartbeat, sweating, nausea and vomiting and respiratory difficulty. People with cardiac arrhythmias should consult their doctors about when to use epinephrine.</p>
