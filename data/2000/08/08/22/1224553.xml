        <p>VeriSign, a leading provider of encrypted messaging and payment services on the Internet, and Slam Dunk Networks, which manages business-to-business communications on the Internet, said that they would offer a service starting in October that would provide security and speed in handling data previously available only on private or specialized networks. The two Silicon Valley companies plan to charge 0.5 cent to 2 cents for each kilobyte of information handled, compared with services that now cost up to 32 cents a kilobyte. The service could speed the migration of electronic business transactions from private networks to the public Internet.</p>
