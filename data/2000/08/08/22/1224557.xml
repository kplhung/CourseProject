        <p>Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone AirTouch, has placed its Northeast local and tactical account into review, in addition to two other regional accounts being reviewed. Billings were estimated at $50 million.</p>
        <p>Jim Gerace, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless in Bedminster, N.J., confirmed reports of the review this week in Advertising Age and Adweek, adding that ''there are a lot of overlaps and redundancies and we're trying to clean up some of that.''

        <p>Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone AirTouch, has placed its Northeast local and tactical account into review, in addition to two other regional accounts being reviewed. Billings were estimated at $50 million.</p>
        <p>Jim Gerace, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless in Bedminster, N.J., confirmed reports of the review this week in Advertising Age and Adweek, adding that ''there are a lot of overlaps and redundancies and we're trying to clean up some of that.'' He said Verizon Wireless is looking to consolidate the Northeast regional advertising account at one agency; likewise, he said, Verizon is looking to consolidate the Southwest region at one agency, and the South Central region at one agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerace said that there were at least three agencies handling local and tactical advertising in the Northeast; the agency that handles the bulk of that is the Bozell Group in New York, part of True North Communications, which has been invited to take part in the review, he said. Bozell also handles national brand advertising for Verizon Wireless, which is not affected by the Northeast regional review. He declined to name other agencies invited to the review because it was still in the early stages.</p>
        <p>John Bonomo, a spokesman for Verizon Communications in New York, declined to comment about a report in Advertising Age this week that Verizon Communications was looking to consolidate its media buying account, with billings estimated at $300 million.</p>
