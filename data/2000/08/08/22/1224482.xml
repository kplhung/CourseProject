        <p>The Telus Corporation, the largest telecommunications company in western Canada, made a brash move to become the country's biggest wireless telephone network today with an offer worth $3.1 billion for Clearnet Communications Inc. of Toronto.</p>
        <p>The takeover would greatly accelerate the expansion of Telus and pose a competitive challenge to two other big Canadian telecommunications providers, the Bell Mobility division of Bell Canada of Montreal, the country's largest telecommunications organization, and Rogers AT&amp;T Canada, a unit of Rogers Communications Inc. of Toronto.</p>

        <p>The Telus Corporation, the largest telecommunications company in western Canada, made a brash move to become the country's biggest wireless telephone network today with an offer worth $3.1 billion for Clearnet Communications Inc. of Toronto.</p>
        <p>The takeover would greatly accelerate the expansion of Telus and pose a competitive challenge to two other big Canadian telecommunications providers, the Bell Mobility division of Bell Canada of Montreal, the country's largest telecommunications organization, and Rogers AT&amp;T Canada, a unit of Rogers Communications Inc. of Toronto.</p>
        <p>Like other wireless phone companies, the Canadian competitors are scrambling to gain geographic reach, partly in anticipation of a boom in demand for Internet services delivered via wireless networks.</p>
        <p>''Wireless and Internet applications are the two fastest-growing areas in telecommunications,'' said Darren Entwistle, president and chief executive of Telus, based in Burnaby, British Columbia. ''Our objective is to become the Canadian leader of this market.''</p>
        <p>Michael Cant, an analyst at Renaissance Strategies in Waltham, Mass., said Telus had strengthened its hand by moving quickly to gain a national wireless network. But he also expressed caution that with so many wireless networks under construction around the world, companies like Telus might find themselves in tough competition with new marketers who are able to buy capacity at inexpensive rates.</p>
        <p>Shareholders of Clearnet have been offered 70 Canadian dollars, or $47.18, in cash, or 1.636 of a Telus non-voting share for their stock, a total of 4.6 billion Canadian dollars. Telus will also assume Clearnet's debt of 2 billion Canadian dollars, or $1.36 billion. The offer has been endorsed by the boards of both companies.</p>
        <p>The offering price is a 53 percent premium to Friday's closing price of 45.80 Canadian dollars on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In trading today, Clearnet shares surged 42 percent, to 64.95 Canadian dollars, still below the offer of 70 Canadian dollars a share. Telus shares fell 10 percent to close at 40.05 Canadian dollars in Toronto.</p>
        <p>Telus said the offer, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to be completed by October. George Cope, president and chief executive of Clearnet, would head Telus's wireless division.</p>
        <p>Clearnet shareholders would own 18.5 percent of Telus. Shareholders with 86 percent of the voting stock and more than 30 percent of total equity have agreed to the bid -- including the family of the founder David S. Simmonds; Nextel Communications Inc. of Reston, Va.; and Motorola Canada Ltd. of Montreal.</p>
        <p>While Motorola may sell its shares after a one-year holding period expires, Nextel may remain as a strategic investor. Through Nextel, Clearnet links its Canadian wireless customers with the United States, just as the Verizon network in the United States ties in with Telus.</p>
        <p>Previously based in Edmonton, Alberta, Telus was owned by the provincial government and called the Alberta Government Telephones Commission before it was privatized in 1990.</p>
        <p>Clearnet was formed in 1984 and has raised more than 3.2 billion Canadian dollars to build two digital networks -- Clearnet PCS and Mike, which integrates PCS phone service with two-way radio, data and other communications services for businesses. With Clearnet, Telus avoids having to build its own cross-country wireless network, and it will become a national competitor three years earlier than many had expected.</p>
        <p>The combined company would have 26,000 employees and revenue of 6.5 billion Canadian dollars -- a quarter of it from the mobile phone operation.</p>
