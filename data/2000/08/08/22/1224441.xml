        <p>Using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers recently peered into the heart of the star cluster M15, an assemblage of several hundred thousand stars about 40,000 light-years distant in the constellation Pegasus, hoping to solve an astronomical mystery. Their target was a pinkish cloud, nestled by the upper left of the cluster's core. Such clouds, known as planetary nebulae, are blasted from dying stars about the mass of the sun, but the stars in M15, some 12 million years old, were thought to be too light to engage in such pyrotechnics. Because more massive stars evolve and burn out faster than lighter ones, astronomers deduced that there should not be any stars as massive as the sun still burning in M15. They suspected that the cloud, named Kuestner 648, would be shown to harbor a double star, but none was detected. The dying star remains a mystery.</p>

        <p>Correction:  August 24, 2000, Thursday  A picture caption in Science Times on Tuesday about the star cluster M15 misstated the age of the stars there. They are about 12 billion years old, not 12 million.</p>
