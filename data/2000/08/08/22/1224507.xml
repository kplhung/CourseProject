        <p>The Russians are not, as the old movie would have it, coming. They have gone.</p>
        <p>Some have just slammed the door on America -- the country where, as one of them put it, his Russian friends have become ''slaves to the dollar'' -- and have gone back home, to Moscow, to St. Petersburg, to Kiev.</p>
        <p>And by voicing just what they feel about this place, they have left in their wake a small but impassioned debate about how Russians really view America.</p>
        <p>It was a furor that journalists at The Russian Bazaar, a weekly newspaper based in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, scarcely expected when they published an article last month titled ''Why They Are Leaving.''</p>
        <p>In the story, Valentin Labunsky, a 49-year-old journalist from Kiev who has been in America four years, wrote at great length about the complaints of three departing immigrants: a 24-year-old female student, a 30-year-old male journalist and a 50-year-old former headmaster.</p>
        <p>Broadly speaking, the three, who had been in America from one to four years, bemoaned the obsession with materialism, the emptiness of conversation, the ugliness and what the student deemed ''the utter treelessness'' of their part of Brooklyn, and the functionality and inelegance of what she branded ''the American uniform, jeans and sneakers.'' Above all, they lamented the lack of what Russians call ''dukhovnost,'' the spiritual dimension of life.</p>
        <p>The headmaster from St. Petersburg, his wife, -- a translator of German literature in Russia but retrained here as a bank teller -- and their son, who became a computer programmer, depicted a four-year struggle to establish themselves in New York City. When, finally, they had a halfway decent apartment, good jobs, a car, had paid off their debts and even had some money to spare, he said, ''we suddenly found a terrible emptiness inside.''</p>
        <p>''There, in St. Petersburg, we lived poorly, but to the full,'' continued the headmaster, Ilya, who like other Russians in the article would give only his first name. (Mr. Labunsky said all three feared that giving their full names could lead to trouble with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in part because they have green cards entitling them to live in the United States.)</p>
        <p>Suddenly deprived of their full spiritual life, ''We really realized that human beings do not live by bread alone,'' the headmaster added. ''When we were struggling here to survive, we didn't think about this. But when we had finally staggered to our feet, we started to look for America's dukhovnost. And we just couldn't find it. I don't want to heap dirt on America, a country that accepted us as its own. But neither I, nor my family, could accept the values of this world, all their serials, their humor, their TV. And not because it's worse than ours. It just isn't ours.''</p>
        <p>None of the criticisms voiced in the two-page article were especially new. But they were apparently striking for many of the one million Russian speakers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and for others across the country. Nothing prepared Mr. Labunsky or his boss, Natasha Nakhankova, for the avalanche of reaction from readers. Their paper, which prints just more than 10,000 copies a week and, they say, has a readership of some 40,000, received a flood of phone calls and 237 long, handwritten letters in one week, some from as far away as California. They printed pages of the most articulate letters, along with forceful rebuttals to the three departees in a series by Mr. Labunsky titled ''Why We Are Staying.''</p>
        <p>Most of the letters, especially those written by emigres who went through the horrors of leaving the Soviet Union in the 1970's and 1980's, were passionate paeans to America. As Ms. Nakhankova, 44, concluded in an editorial, ''the discussion has shown how dear America is to most of us, what patriots we have become today, we, who so recently thought that the very word patriotism was something dreamed up by Communist propagandists.'' The outpouring of gratitude for the assistance given to many emigres and the chance to build a good life was the stuff of a White House speechwriter's dreams.</p>
        <p>Scattered among the letters, however, was isolated support for those who decided to go back. A woman who signed herself simply Vita said the stories of the departing immigrants had made her weep because ''everything they say is the purest truth.''</p>
        <p>After six years in America, she indicated, she would not return to Russia, but her estrangement even now from America was plain. Voicing sentiments that are common enough among arrivals from the former Soviet Union -- though not, generally, among their children, educated here -- she complained bitterly about the bad treatment caseworkers give ex-Soviets asking for welfare, about the loud music of her neighbors and the continual worries about making ends meet.</p>
        <p>Immigration, she concluded, ''is like moving a flower that should live in black earth to sandy soil. It is still alive, but with each day it withers, and finally it stops blooming, and all that remains is a coarse stem.''</p>
        <p>More than 380,000 immigrants have come from the former Soviet Union since it began collapsing 10 years ago. Although there are no figures on the number of people who have returned, nobody imagines that there is a mass movement back to the former Soviet Union. For one thing, the struggling countries formed from the breakup of the Soviet empire are all very poor, often affording little in the way of jobs or wages.</p>
        <p>Some Moscow residents, however, do report that several friends who had left for western Europe and for Israel have been trickling back to live and work back home. Young and educated Russians find that they can parlay their Western experience and their new languages into good jobs in Moscow, either in the expanding field of marketing and advertising, or in representing foreign firms.</p>
        <p>This kind of movement is an acknowledgment of how things have changed since the bad old days of the Cold War. The immigrants who arrived then had been forced to burn their bridges, sell off apartments, renounce citizenship and arrive in their new homelands with little in their pockets.</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, however, the collapse of communism has made travel freer. And, if they can get past tightening visa requirements in all Western countries, Russians, Ukrainians and others from the former Soviet world are increasingly dipping their toes into America, just to see what it is like.</p>
        <p>Dmitri is a 23-year-old lawyer from Kiev who also refused to give his full name. He said in an interview that he had been in the United States, off and on, for four years, liked it well enough and determinedly avoided discussing whether he missed Kiev. (''Nostalgia,'' he said briskly, ''is a hard thing to think about.'') In his view, the three who returned home are ''losers'' who lack his toughness.</p>
        <p>Yet Dmitri, too, hangs out mostly with other young Russians because, he said, the kind of educated Americans he would like to socialize with ''look down on us.''</p>
        <p>As for staying here, who knows?</p>
        <p>''I'm kind of lost in the world,'' Dmitri said. ''I have been born in the Soviet Union. Since my homeland collapsed, I've been looking for my place in the world.''</p>
        <p>The contrast with Maksim, the 30-year-old journalist interviewed by Mr. Labunsky before he returned to Moscow in June, is stark. Reached by telephone at his Moscow apartment, Maksim could not have sounded more at home.</p>
        <p>''I calmed down a lot, being back here,'' he said. ''Here, I really feel as if I am in my place, where I belong. One reason is that I realized I have to be really in the center of Russian culture -- and not on its edges.''</p>
        <p>Maksim, who is back in his old job at a Moscow newspaper, said the education of his 7-year-old son also played a big part in the decision to move back.</p>
        <p>''The school we can get him into here will give him a much better education than the public school in Brooklyn which was the only realistic scenario there,'' Maksim said.  ''My son will always be able to go to America -- it won't be closed off to him,'' Maksim added. ''Russia is getting more Americanized, and anyway America is a more universal culture than ours. It will be accessible. If we stayed in America, he would be completely American, and not know our culture, which is more Eastern, and harder to get to know. I write poems -- I want him to be able to read them.''</p>
