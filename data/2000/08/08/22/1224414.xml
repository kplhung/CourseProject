        <p>Clinical drug trials, in which volunteers are given drugs or placebos so that researchers can gauge the effectiveness of a particular treatment, are a linchpin of modern medicine.</p>
        <p>But in one recent trial, a new study says, 30 percent of the volunteers falsely reported taking their medication. Instead, the study found, the volunteers engaged in a practice called dumping, simply disposing of the drugs they were given.</p>
        <p>The report is in the August issue of Chest, the journal of the American College of Chest Physicians, and was prepared by researchers at Johns Hopkins and U.C.L.A.</p>
        <p>The study involved patients being studied to evaluate smoking cessation techniques and the effectiveness of an inhaled bronchodilator in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>
        <p>The researchers were following up on earlier studies that found some volunteers were discharging their inhalers instead of taking the medication. The participants knew that on each visit to the researchers their inhalers would be weighed, to see if the amount of drug missing corresponded to the amount they reported taking.</p>
        <p>The goal of the study was to help researchers predict which volunteers were most likely to be dishonest. But, said Michael Simmons, one of the U.C.L.A. researchers, ''I couldn't find anything that would seem to indicate who would do this.''</p>
        <p>Researchers gave 241 patients inhalers and asked them to take two puffs at least three times a day. The inhalers were designed to record the date and time of each use -- but 101 of the volunteers did not know this.</p>
