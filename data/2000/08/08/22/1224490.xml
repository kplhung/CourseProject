        <p>When Norwegian divers opened the emergency escape hatch on the sunken Russian submarine on Sunday, they had done in a day what Russian rescue workers had not managed in a week. The tragic story of the Kursk is only the latest evidence that Russia can no longer afford to maintain the technology created in the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>The Kursk was a quintessential Soviet creation, huge as the superpower's ambition, equipped to destroy entire groups of vessels many times its own size -- and, of course, top-secret. But we now know that for years the sub has been going to sea without even the required emergency food and water supplies on board.</p>
        <p>The help of Norwegian deep-sea divers was needed because Russia has none of its own. Some say this is because the country has not developed the sophisticated equipment necessary for deep-sea diving, while others claim that ships on which divers would normally be based have been written off for lack of maintenance. In other words, the Kursk and nine other huge nuclear submarines could function only as long as they could avoid accidents.</p>
        <p>But the Kursk tragedy has two main protagonists: the submarine itself and Vladimir Putin, who is facing the first emergency of his presidency. Like the submarine, Mr. Putin is a quintessential product of the Soviet era. The Communist state's ultimate ambition was to create a new type of man, and the robot-like qualities of Mr. Putin may be the predictable result.</p>
        <p>In the rare interviews when he has discussed his own background, he has gone to great lengths to define himself as a man average in every way, taken along by the system and a remarkable fate that landed him in the country's highest office. There seemed to be a great discrepancy between his background and his high position -- and now it seems that, like the Kursk and its fleet, Mr. Putin lacked the resources to cope with an emergency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's statements about the Kursk have been meager. At first he said nothing and refused even to cut short his vacation in a Black Sea resort. Then he made a brief statement that seemed to indicate that he considered salvaging the equipment on board the Kursk more important than rescuing the crew.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, on the seventh day since the sinking, when criticism had reached a deafening pitch, Mr. Putin finally decided to fly back to Moscow. Cornered in Yalta, he defended his decision not to fly immediately to the area near the disaster. ''I think I did the right thing,'' Mr. Putin said, ''because the arrival of nonspecialists from any field, the presence of high-placed officials in the disaster area would not help and more often would hamper work. Everyone should keep to his place.''</p>
        <p>The phrasing was telling. The words for ''highly placed officials'' literally mean ''top-level bureaucrats.'' Mr. Putin could have said ''executives'' or ''leaders,'' but instead chose words suggesting that he sees himself as a bureaucrat who should keep to his place, not a leader who should go where the trouble is.</p>
        <p>It was leadership that the people trying to save the Kursk crew needed most. They needed a leader who, placing human life above all, would seek foreign assistance from the start, instead of refusing offers of help until after signs of life stopped coming from the sub. They needed a leader who would order the names of sailors on the sub made public immediately, instead of letting relatives remain in suspense until Day Six, when some journalists succeeded in buying the information from the Navy.</p>
        <p>They needed a leader who would order that relatives of crew members be granted free vouchers to fly to the rescue site -- instead of forcing relatives to take up a collection to buy the cheapest available train tickets and undertake a two-day journey. They needed a leader who would break through the military's natural urge to err on the side of caution, which compelled the border control to delay foreign rescue ships for an additional six hours after they arrived in the area.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has indicated that he knew from the start that most of the crew were dead and this was why he failed to shift into an emergency mode. If more people had been alive immediately after the accident, he seemed to imply, more would have been done sooner. This kind of mathematics betrays a perfectly Soviet disregard for the individual.</p>
        <p>It is no surprise, ultimately, that at a time of crisis Mr. Putin demonstrated the cog-in-the-wheel mentality on which he was reared. But the Kursk disaster shows that Russia can no more afford a Soviet-era ''top-level bureaucrat'' in charge than it can afford to maintain its Soviet-era nuclear submarines.</p>
