        <p>A 65-year-old woman known to her neighbors as the unofficial grandmother of her apartment building on the Upper West Side was found dead in her apartment yesterday with a plastic bag over her head, the police said.</p>
        <p>The woman, identified by friends as Sallie Holmes, had been dead for several days, possibly since Thursday, the police and neighbors said.</p>
        <p>Several neighbors on the 11th floor of the Stephen Wise Towers, a public housing building at 74 West 92nd Street, said that they had noticed a foul smell coming from her Mrs. Holmes's apartment in recent days.</p>
        <p>The medical examiner's office and the police are investigating the cause of death. The police said there were no suspects.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Holmes, whose children were grown and whose husband had died, had lived in the building, between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, for at least 30 years, neighbors said.</p>
        <p>When she was not patrolling the hallways and saying hello to everyone who came her way, she was sitting on a bench in front of the building, passing the time.</p>
        <p>''She was like a part of this building, almost like a mother or a grandmother,'' said a woman who lived on the 11th floor and would not give her name.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Holmes was especially fond of children and would refer to those in the 22-story building as ''my babies.''</p>
        <p>''She saw us all grow up,'' said Pedro Gonzalez, 35. ''She used to say she was going to spank us. She was a good lady.''</p>
        <p>The woman who lived on the 11th floor said that her husband had seen Mrs. Holmes in the hall on Thursday and exchanged greetings with her. But by Sunday, residents were noticing an odor, and yesterday someone called the police, who forced their way into the apartment around noon and found the body, said Sgt. James Foley, a police spokesman.</p>
