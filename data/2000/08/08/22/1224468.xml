        <p>He had lived in self-imposed exile for the past three years, infuriating the British government with a series of disclosures about the country's two ultra-secret security agencies. But today David Shayler, a former security agent who calls himself a patriot and a whistle-blower, returned to Britain to be branded a criminal.</p>
        <p>Under an agreement with the government that said he would be released on bail if he gave himself up, Mr. Shayler, 34, was arrested in Dover this morning as he stepped off a ferry from Calais. Mr. Shayler was charged with two violations of Britain's Official Secrets Act, a sweeping law that outlaws unauthorized disclosures of any kind about the internal workings of the government. He faces a trial and, if found guilty, could be sentenced to up to four years in prison.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shayler worked for three years at one of Britain's security agencies, known as M.I.5, serving in areas dealing with terrorism in Northern Ireland as well as throughout the world, and with background checks for government officials. He quit in early 1997, disillusioned with what he said was a pervasive culture of drunkenness, apathy, incompetence and lack of accountability there. His complaints were outlined in a newspaper article in 1997, as was Mr. Shayler's accusation that M.I.5 had kept secret files on several members of the current government, including Peter Mandelson, now the Northern Ireland secretary, when they were active in student movements in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>The government quickly obtained a far-reaching civil injunction barring the British news media from airing any more of Mr. Shayler's disclosures, which included accusations that M.I.5 mishandled investigations of Irish Republican Army attacks in London in the 1990's and that it failed to take steps that would have prevented the bombing of the Israeli Embassy in 1994. Mr. Shayler, sensing that he was about to be arrested, fled the country, moving to the Netherlands and eventually settling in France.</p>
        <p>But what really angered the British government was a far more explosive allegation by Mr. Shayler, who said that Britain's other security agency, M.I.6, which is the foreign intelligence service, had spent $160,000 or so in a plot to assassinate Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, in February 1996. (The plot went awry, he said, when agents paid by the agency put a bomb under the wrong car, killing several Libyan bystanders).</p>
        <p>When Mr. Shayler threatened to publish details of the alleged plot on the Internet, he was arrested and held in a Paris prison for three and a half months. But he was ultimately released when the French government refused to extradite him, saying that the British charges against him were politically motivated.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the government dismissed talk of an anti-Qaddafi plot as ''pure fantasy.'' In an interview in 1998, Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, said that he was ''perfectly satisfied'' that the previous Tory government had never put forward such a plan, and that there was nothing to suggest that M.I.6 had ''any interest, any role or any experience of any such escapade.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Shayler has always said he eventually wanted to come home. And, now that Britain is poised to incorporate into its domestic law the European Convention on Human Rights -- a set of principles that includes the right to freedom of expression -- he said he feels he stands a better chance of being acquitted when his case comes to trial.</p>
        <p>It is uncertain whether the government will actually prosecute him, however.</p>
        <p>''It is a farcical situation to make it a crime to report a crime,'' he said.</p>
