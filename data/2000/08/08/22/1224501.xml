        <p>THE ABORTION ISSUE</p>
        <p>'CHOOSE LIFE' TAGS PROMPT LAWSUIT -- For years, Florida drivers have been able to buy specialty license plates that proclaim their love of the panther, the manatee, the University of Florida Gators and Florida A&amp;M Rattlers. Now they have another option, a new specialty tag that reads ''Choose Life'' in a childlike scrawl. The tags, created by legislation sponsored by State Representative Bev Kilmer, Republican of Quincy, have already resulted in one lawsuit from the National Organization for Women, and more legal challenges are expected as the sale of the tags spreads around the state. Approved by the State Legislature last year, the tags, which cost an additional $22, will benefit adoption services. But lawsuits, some state officials say, could ultimately result in a statewide recall. The tags, which went on sale this week in South Florida, also feature the smiling faces of two children.</p>

        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>AN UPHILL BATTLE IN GEORGIA -- Former Senator Mack Mattingly began his uphill race to return to the United States Senate from Georgia over the weekend, starting in Marietta, one of the most Republican cities in the state. Mr. Mattingly, a Republican running in a special election to succeed the late Paul Coverdell, is facing former Gov. Zell Miller, a better-financed and more popular Democratic candidate. But he told several hundred Republicans on Saturday that he is the true heir to Mr. Coverdell. Several party officials at the gathering said they agreed. Chuck Clay, the state Republican chairman, told the group that there is no such thing as a Paul Coverdell Democrat.'' Technically, the election is nonpartisan, and both candidates have been running as fiscal conservatives.</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>NADER QUESTIONS GORE AS POPULIST -- Ralph Nader, the nominee of the Green Party, challenged Vice President Al Gore's populist credentials yesterday and urged him to reject campaign money from industries that he criticized during his address to the Democratic National Convention. ''In his speech he challenged and criticized the giant drug companies, the oil companies, the pharmaceutical industry, the H.M.O.'s,'' Mr. Nader said at a news conference in Los Angeles. ''He talked populist but buys into corporate power.'' Speaking outside the Staples Center, site of the Democratic National Convention last week, Mr. Nader called on Mr. Gore to return campaign money contributed by ''big tobacco, big oil, big polluters, the pharmaceutical companies, the H.M.O.'s.''</p>
