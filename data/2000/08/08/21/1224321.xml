        <p>Few local political races are laced with the kind of unvarnished acrimony seen in a primary contest being waged in the 32nd Senate District in the South Bronx between an incumbent state senator who is one of the Democratic Party's most loyal soldiers and his predecessor, an ardent enemy of the party organization.</p>
        <p>For the last four years, Pedro Espada Jr., who operates a large health care center in the Bronx, has been the principal thorn in the side of the Democratic Party organization in the borough. And Mr. Espada is now engaged in another primary battle to regain the seat he lost four years ago.</p>
        <p>In doing so, he is taking on David Rosado, who acquiesced to the wishes of party leaders in 1996, when he resigned his City Council seat to run against Mr. Espada. That matchup was short-lived. Mr. Espada was removed from the ballot because of irregularities in his nominating petitions. In their last battle, in the 1998 Democratic primary, Mr. Rosado prevailed, but by just 745 votes, making his one of the narrowest victories in the state that year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada, 46, is back this year in what has become a high-voltage battle filled with old grudges and bitterness. On any given day, residents in the district might run into the caravans of either of the competitors, with sound trucks blaring the names of the candidate. Posters for the candidates are in storefronts. And the candidates have been spending their mornings greeting voters at subway stations and their evenings in door-to-door campaigning throughout the district.</p>
        <p>The Rosado campaign, for example, is operating telephone banks from three different locations. And Mr. Espada has opened three offices and has campaign workers deployed throughout the district, passing out campaign literature, T-shirts and campaign trinkets to get the attention of voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosado, 58, said the closeness of the 1998 primary was a reflection of his limited campaign activity that year. He said that he spent months suffering from a nerve disorder in his neck and that he had surgery for it before the primary. ''But this year,'' he said, ''I am out here working hard, campaigning every day and I am connecting with the people.''</p>
        <p>He defends his stewardship in the State Senate, saying he worked vigorously to create a bill, signed into law last month, that imposes harsher sentences on criminals in New York who single out their victims on the basis of sexual orientation, race, religion or age.</p>
        <p>''I have a long record of working within the community,'' said Mr. Rosado, a former state assemblyman and city councilman. ''I have worked on creating new housing for the people in the Bronx. I have helped people with landlord-tenant disputes. I have worked hard in the district and in Albany.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada, who served in the State Senate from 1992 to 1996, said he was running again because of his desire to expand economic opportunities for the residents of the district. He said he would work with the Republican majority in the Senate to bring job creation programs to the district and to increase the number of public housing units.</p>
        <p>Assailing his opponent, Mr. Espada said: ''David Rosado is not a leader. We are in one of the poorest districts in the state and Rosado is simply an instrument of the local political operation. Clubhouse politicians treat their positions as jobs. I see it as an opportunity to create new change for our community. He is an instrument of the Democratic machine.''</p>
        <p>The Espada family has had its share of tangles with that machine. The most dramatic came in 1996, when Mr. Espada was in the Senate and his son, Pedro Gautier Espada, won a special election for an open Assembly seat. But later that year, after a feud, the Espadas broke with the Democratic organization, which resulted in Mr. Rosado running against the senator, and Ruben Diaz Jr. running against the son.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the party organization was then successful in having both Espadas thrown off the ballot after finding irregularities in their nominating petitions.</p>
        <p>Since then, however, the Espadas have enjoyed at least something of a political comeback. In 1997, Pedro Gautier Espada was elected to the City Council in an embarrassing defeat for the Democratic organization. And a year later, Jose Espada, the former senator's brother, was elected a Democratic district leader.</p>
        <p>The following year saw more difficulties for Pedro Espada Jr. He was arraigned with two of his employees on charges that they had illegally diverted $221,000 in Medicaid money to his failed 1996 re-election campaign and that of his son, the assemblyman. But Mr. Espada said the charges were politically motivated since they came just a few days after he announced that he would run. The case is still pending.</p>
        <p>The current Espada campaign has become a family affair. His son, the councilman, is the campaign chairman, and another son, Alex, is working as the field director. But the Rosado campaign has also enlisted a high-profile campaign manager: Assemblyman Diaz. Mr. Diaz won his last election by a margin so wide that he is considered one of the borough's most popular politicians.</p>
        <p>The 32nd Senate District sweeps through the southern tier of the Bronx, and includes the Crotona, Soundview, Clason Point and Mott Haven neighborhoods. In the 1990 census, the district was 61 percent Hispanic and 31 percent black. Non-Hispanic white residents accounted for about 5 percent of the district's population.</p>
        <p>Many Bronx Democrats expect that this year's race in the district will be close. Both campaigns say they will spend about $150,000 on the campaign leading to the Sept. 12 primary. Mr. Rosado has the support of the Bronx Democratic organization, but Mr. Espada, who employs more than 300 full-time workers in the Bronx, said he would have hundreds of campaign workers at his disposal on Election Day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosado predicts that because he is campaigning more vigorously, his victory will be more substantial this year and that winning by an overwhelming majority, as he hopes to, will likely mean an end to Mr. Espada's interest in running for the State Senate seat.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he will run again if I win big,'' Mr. Rosado said. ''That's why I'm working so hard.''</p>
