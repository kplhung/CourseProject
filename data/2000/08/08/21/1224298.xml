        <p>After the plates of spicy raw tuna and wasabi-crusted tofu were cleared from the table of a Greenwich Village restaurant one recent evening, discussion turned to probably the hottest topic among New York entrepreneurs these days: the wireless Internet.</p>
        <p>''Where's the talent?'' asked Tyler Daines, a venture capitalist who is backing a wireless Web start-up with offices in Manhattan and Helsinki.</p>
        <p>''Where's the killer app?'' asked Gordon Gould, chief executive of a mobile communications company.</p>
        <p>''Why isn't this discussion taking place in California?'' asked Andrew Seybold, a Silicon Valley wireless consultant and industry-newsletter publisher.</p>
        <p>The answer to all these questions lies in New York, which is emerging as the nation's center for wireless Internet applications, financing and advertising. Eager to expunge the dot-com taint -- the volatile stock valuations based on questionable, pure-play Internet business models -- much of Silicon Alley is recasting itself in a wireless role.</p>
        <p>There is even a new buzzword to describe the scene: ''unstrung.''</p>
        <p>The unstrung are undaunted by some experts' gloomy forecasts that the wireless Internet might never live up to its billing if users are turned off by the current, bland offerings of e-mail or sports scores, served up as scanty lines of text on the tiny screens of cellular phones and other mobile devices.</p>
        <p>Undeterred, more than two dozen New York wireless Internet companies have been created in the last year or so. The rookie lineup includes Savos, which delivers Internet music and other Web-based audio to mobile phones; SmartRay, a portal seeking be the wireless Yahoo, and Upoc, which focuses on Internet text-messaging services intended for young wireless phone enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>The West Coast remains the locus of wireless technology development. And there are many more wireless Internet services and applications already up and running in Europe -- eagerly embraced by people weary of balky wired telephone networks. But it is New York that has become the fertile breeding ground for new uses and services through wireless hand-held devices.</p>
        <p>Part of the impetus is geographic. ''Manhattan has the potential to be the center of deals between the U.S. and Europe, where the wireless phenomenon is much stronger,'' said Mark Caron, chief executive of MobileSpring, a so-called incubator company in New York that is focused on wireless start-ups. What's more, he said, ''the level of creativity here is unequaled.''</p>
        <p>And then, of course, there is New York's standing as a major money center. A host of financiers with operations in New York are focusing on the wireless Internet, with big players including Flatiron Partners, a venture capital firm that has had ties with Chase Manhattan and Softbank of Japan. Others, like Nokia Venture Partners, the investment arm of the Finnish mobile phone giant Nokia, are preparing to set up New York offices.</p>
        <p>''New York is getting hot very quickly,'' said Tom Kenney, a principal at Nokia Venture Partners, who plans to move the firm's East Coast base to New York from Washington.</p>
        <p>The field is so new and so much in flux that no one pretends to have firm figures on investments, jobs created or even the number of new wireless Internet companies in New York. But many with money agree that the mobile Internet is one of the few Net-related areas that continues to solicit strong interest among entrepreneurs and investors.</p>
        <p>''We were among the first to carve out a space in the area,'' said Seth Goldstein of Flatiron Partners.</p>
        <p>The New York wireless scene is buzzing, so much so that an online magazine has been created to cover it all: the magazine, Unstrung, seeks to blend the sophistication of Wallpaper, an architecture and design magazine, with the attention to detail of trade publications like Wireless Week. Unstrung's motto is ''tied to nothing but the future.''</p>
        <p>''We're on the cusp where the kids in sandals at the dot-coms are turning their attention to wireless,'' said Josh Newman, a former schoolteacher in the South Bronx, who help found Unstrung and serves as its top editor. ''The opportunity to cover this potentially huge niche was looking us right in the face.''</p>
        <p>Stoking Mr. Newman's hope that Unstrung can hit it big was a panel discussion about the wireless Internet last month held by the New York New Media Association at N.Y.U. The event's organizers had to turn away about 200 people after the crowd reached the fire marshal's limit of 1,100.</p>
        <p>Many were employees at Silicon Alley dot-coms who were hoping to learn more about what was being touted as the next big thing. A good many others were from other walks of life -- just curious about a subject that true believers discuss with equal parts grandeur and jargon. (''Talk spurt'' and ''location-based services'' are two favorites in the unstrung lexicon.)</p>
        <p>Some people in New York's wireless Internet scene, think that the buzz surrounding the young industry -- including the verbiage -- is risky.</p>
        <p>''We're concerned that the hype level, combined with the lack of knowledge about the limitations of the wireless Internet, could turn people off in the same way pure Internet plays are falling out of favor,'' said Brian Bodell, head of marketing strategies at Mobile Metrics, a company providing advertising services for wireless users. ''That's why you rarely see a wireless Internet company with a dot-com in their name and why many companies want to show they're not betting all their chips on wireless.''</p>
        <p>But certainly some established Silicon Alley Web development companies see advantages in having a stake in wireless. For instance, Razorfish and Agency.com, two players with international reach that help companies develop and roll out their Web operations, are expanding their New York wireless operations.</p>
        <p>''Until six or eight weeks ago, we had no concrete wireless plans for North America'' said David Eastman, Agency's head of mobile business for Europe, during a recent trip to New York. ''But now, we're ready to promote a knowledge bleed from London to New York because this is where the action is.''</p>
        <p>Among the pure-play mobile Internet start-ups, New York's best known so far may be Vindigo, which provides maps and information from publications like the Zagat restaurant guides, for use on Palm hand-helds and other portable devices.</p>
        <p>The service is not yet a true wireless Internet application, because users must download the material through a standard, land-line Internet connection. But the information is formatted for relatively easy searching and reading on a hand-held device, and the company plans to offer wireless updating as network technology evolves.</p>
        <p>Nearly 100,000 people have downloaded the company's city guides in six months in New York and four other urban regions, making Vindigo one of the first applications of its kind to show potential of spreading ''virally'' -- by word of mouth, or mouse -- and with little formal advertising.</p>
        <p>''We're creating the technology which will allow content providers to extend their brand to the wireless realm,'' said Jason Devitt, 31, who left a job selling derivatives at D. E. Shaw, a technology-focused investment bank, to become Vindigo's chief executive last year.</p>
        <p>''Look around,'' Mr. Devitt said, pointing to the frenzied activity in Vindigo's disheveled headquarters in a gutted building in the garment district. ''We have no time to pause and think about whether we're going to be a big part of the location-based services segment because we're already there.''</p>
        <p>While Vindigo offers a glimpse of an industry poised for takeoff, most wireless Internet companies in New York are in the early stages of development -- ''stealth mode,'' as people familiar with the start-ups put it. Few have advanced beyond the first stages of financing provided by venture capitalists.</p>
        <p>Still, the sense that new applications can evolve well beyond stock quotes or short e-mail has some people believing that local companies have a bright future.</p>
        <p>Tim Connolly, director of Ericsson CyberLab, a research and development company set up in New York's financial district by the Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson, said that ''with the mobile Internet, it seems the transition from technology to services is happening faster than it happened on the Web, and thus the services focus that New York has plays a large role.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, the advantage of being close to the television, publishing, telecommunications and financial industries of New York is a lure for anyone seeking to hop on the wireless Internet bandwagon.</p>
        <p>But given the industry's current limitations, there is a chance that companies focusing on applications for the wireless Internet might be in for the rough road traveled by many a struggling content provider for the hard-wired Web.</p>
        <p>After all, there are two definitions of ''unstrung'' in the American Heritage Concise Dictionary. One is ''having the strings loosened or removed.'' The other is ''emotionally upset.''</p>
