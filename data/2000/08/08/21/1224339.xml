        <p>The ominous signs had been piling up during training camp for cornerback Otis Smith. He was coming back from a twice-broken clavicle -- first injured during training camp last season and again in the first game after he returned from the original injury.</p>
        <p>In his absence, the secondary had solidified and Smith, who entered camp last season as a starter, dropped during this camp to the fifth cornerback on the depth chart, behind even the rookie Tony Scott. Most critically, his salary cap number, $1.2 million, was enormous for a backup who would be 35 years old during the season. One more thing: the Jets got his number wrong in the media guide.</p>
        <p>The ax finally fell for Smith today, when the Jets waived eight players, cutting their roster to 62 before Tuesday's deadline for the 65-man roster. The Jets must slim down to 53 players by Aug. 27.</p>
        <p>Smith, an 11-year veteran who was in his sixth straight training camp with the Jets, was the most notable player cut loose, although his departure was not unexpected. Still, the loss of Smith, who was on Bill Parcells's New England team that went to the Super Bowl, had the deepest reverberations. Coach Al Groh said that Smith's large salary-cap number was a factor in the decision. Scott, a sixth-round pick, will make just $193,000 this season, and he counts just $217,000 against the salary cap.</p>
        <p>''Otis has been a very important part of what we've done both here and in New England,'' Groh said. ''I respect a great deal what he's done for us. He's a consummate professional playing on the corner. We just felt at this point, we were going to go in a different direction.</p>
        <p>''The same cycle that brings players into the league eventually carries them out. Almost every player on the team, when he came into the league, somebody had the job he took. Eventually, it comes back around at the end.''</p>
        <p>Smith, who has played in 109 regular-season games, joined the Jets as a free agent in 1995. Smith was waived by the Jets early in the 1996 season and signed by New England. In the Patriots' playoff victory over Jacksonville, Smith scooped up a fumble and returned the ball 47 yards for the game-deciding touchdown. He re-signed with the Jets before the 1997 season and started all 33 regular-season games he was in uniform for.</p>
        <p>Smith was also a well-liked leader in the locker room and grew particularly close to Marcus Coleman, whom he helped tutor.</p>
        <p>''He's been through everything,'' Coleman said. ''The highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows. He was like my big brother, to be honest. It's like losing a brother.''</p>
        <p>Smith is likely to surface elsewhere, perhaps back in New England with Bill Belichick, who was Smith's coach for the Patriots and Jets.</p>
        <p>''He'll probably be picked up tomorrow,'' Coleman said. ''You only last that long if you've been doing something. I don't care where he goes. I just want him to be somewhere, to be playing.''</p>
        <p>The others waived were the third-year linebacker Casey Dailey, a fifth-round pick in the 1998 draft; the second-year tackle Ian Rafferty, who was rendered expendable by Jumbo Elliott's return from retirement; wide receiver Fred Coleman, a 1999 practice squad member who had little opportunity to compete in the crowded wide receiver field; defensive tackle Richard Seals, the Jets' seventh-round draft choice who missed much of camp with an arm injury; and linebacker Brent Naccara, fullback Mike Stack and linebacker Kelvin Moses, all rookie free agents.</p>
        <p>Groh said none of them were likely to be brought back for the five-man practice squad.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>WAYNE CHREBET fired back at KEYSHAWN JOHNSON's recent suggestion that DEDRIC WARD, not Chrebet, should be the Jets' No. 1 receiver. In comments made recently, Johnson did not refer to Chrebet by name while lobbying for Ward, calling Chrebet ''the other guy.'' Chrebet, when asked why it seems Johnson cannot stop talking about him, said: ''I think he's in love with me. I really, really do.'' Chrebet added, ''I think he should worry about his team and not the New York Jets.'' . . . Chrebet also had an opinion on the Jets' bye week before the start of the regular season. ''It's pretty horrible,'' he said. ''We're antsy to get to the real stuff. You close your eyes and hope this week goes as quickly as possible.'' . . . Running back BERNIE PARMALEE called his foot injury a stress injury that was not a fracture, sustained when another player fell on his foot during a nine-on-seven drill. Parmalee said he would run Sunday and expected to return to practice Monday. . . . Cornerback AARON GLENN (ankle) planned to run Sunday and then determine when he could return to practice after that.</p>
