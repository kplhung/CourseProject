        <p>After losing three of their previous four games and also losing their premier goalkeeper on Wednesday to an act they felt should have been punished by the league, the MetroStars had plenty of incentive to perform at their best this afternoon.</p>
        <p>With goalkeeper Mike Ammann in a hospital bed in Tampa, Fla., the MetroStars exploded for five goals today in a 5-3 triumph over the Colorado Rapids. The Rapids scored twice in the last three minutes, after an inexperienced goalkeeper, Russell Payne, replaced Tim Howard, Ammann's backup, with eight minutes left in the game.</p>
        <p>The victory was an easy jog in sun-soaked Giants Stadium for the MetroStars, who delighted the crowd of 27,897 with a performance reminiscent of their play before the All-Star Game break, when they were undefeated in seven games.</p>
        <p>''It's great to be back to the way we were before the All-Star Game,'' said Mike Petke, who scored the last goal for the MetroStars and created some controversy when he raised his jersey to display a T-shirt underneath that read ''Aug. 16, Crime of the Century'' on the front, and ''Revenge Is Coming'' on the back.</p>
        <p>The words on Petke's T-shirt alluded to Ammann's injury Wednesday at Tampa Bay, in a 4-3 overtime loss to the Mutiny. Ammann has been hospitalized since he collided in that game with Mamadou Diallo, Major League Soccer's leading scorer.</p>
        <p>Ammann sustained three broken ribs and a punctured lung, courtesy of Diallo's left knee. Diallo also stepped on Ammann's face with his foot, bruising Ammann's right cheek.</p>
        <p>That Diallo's action has gone unpunished by the league has infuriated the MetroStars. Coach Octavio Zambrano said that Diallo's action was intentional. ''If the league doesn't come down with a substantial punishment, I think we're setting ourselves up for a huge problem down the line,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Howard was more critical of Diallo's action against Ammann. ''He's a big goal scorer,'' Howard said, ''but he is also a big punk. What he did was clearly blatant. What Mike did this afternoon was a statement echoed by everyone in our locker room.''</p>
        <p>''Justice hasn't been done,'' Tab Ramos said of Diallo's collision with Ammann. ''A person that is guilty should pay for his crime. He should be out for as long as Ammann is out.''</p>
        <p>MetroStars General Manager Nick Sakiewicz said that Ammann would be out for the rest of the season. With Howard going to Australia with the United States Olympic team, the MetroStars may have to search for a goalkeeper because Payne is inexperienced.</p>
        <p>Zambrano put Payne into the game with eight minutes left and the MetroStars holding a 5-1 lead. Payne allowed Colorado's last two goals, one on a penalty kick only three minutes after he entered the game.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars built a four-goal lead on two goals by Clint Mathis and one each by Alex Comas, Mark Chung and Petke. Mathis's goals were his first since July 8 and gave him 11 for the season.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars (15-10-2) can clinch the Eastern Division title with a victory here against Kansas City on Wednesday.</p>
