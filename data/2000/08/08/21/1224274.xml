        <p>The National Geographic Society is venturing into new terrain; it is buying a stake in an online adventure travel company.</p>
        <p>The nonprofit society, created in 1888 for the ''increase and diffusion of geographic knowledge,'' plans to announce today that it will buy 30 percent of iExplore Inc., a privately held Internet company that sells adventure and ''experiential'' vacation tours in 152 countries.

        <p>The National Geographic Society is venturing into new terrain; it is buying a stake in an online adventure travel company.</p>
        <p>The nonprofit society, created in 1888 for the ''increase and diffusion of geographic knowledge,'' plans to announce today that it will buy 30 percent of iExplore Inc., a privately held Internet company that sells adventure and ''experiential'' vacation tours in 152 countries. Experiential travel includes things like culinary tours and Antarctic cruises.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, National Geographic will incorporate iExplore's travel information and database of trips into its own four-year-old Web site, www.nationalgeographic.com. It will promote iExplore in its magazines, which include National Geographic, National Geographic Traveler and National Geographic Adventure. And the society will give iExplore marketing access to its members.</p>
        <p>For its part, iExplore will add National Geographic Expeditions, the society's own tour program, to iExplore's tour offerings. National Geographic content will also appear on iExplore's Web site, which will also carry a National Geographic logo, and allow visitors to chat online with National Geographic experts.</p>
        <p>IExplore, which has had its site since February, is backed by investors that include Soros Private Equity Partners. The company has had sales of less than $5 million so far, according to its founder and chief executive, George M. Deeb.</p>
        <p>John M. Fahey Jr., National Geographic's chief executive and president, said the society had considered developing its own online travel business and had been pursued by several companies besides iExplore.</p>
        <p>Henry Harteveldt, a senior analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said getting the nod from National Geographic was ''extremely impressive'' for iExplore and would give it an edge over competitors like the Gorp.com Web site and tour operators like Mountain Travel Sobek. ''You can't really buy National Geographic's endorsement,'' he said. ''It's like the Good Housekeeping seal of approval.''</p>
