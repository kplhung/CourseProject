        <p>FINE-David. Died in Tamarac, FL, on August 19. His life spanned three centuries and his contributions to his adopted country were many. Along with his late son Leon and late brother Norman, he built homes in Queens, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, which are a tribute to his accomplishments. His word and his bond were greatly respected by business colleagues. Active in community causes, he was a Founder and Past President of Congregation Beth Israel of East Flatbush, a proud member of the Bayside Jewish Center and Member of the Board of Directors of the Tamarac, FL, Jewish Center. His life, together with that of his late, beloved wife, Anna, ardently revolved about his synagogue activities and other aspects of Jewish community life. He was a truly good and pious man. He is survived by his daughters, Renee F. Stave and Nadine F. Stock, grandchildren Gregg, Marjorie, Richard, Matthew and Wayne, and greatgrandchildren Elise, Yasmin, Soraya and Gianna. Services at ''Riverside-Nassau North Chapels,'' 55 No. Station Plaza, Great Neck, NY, on August 21, at 1 PM.</p>
