        <p>New York City is about to become the largest contributor to a broad medical study to determine the effectiveness of an experimental X-ray screening test for diagnosing and treating the early stages of lung cancer.</p>
        <p>The city's contribution of $4 million will come from its share of the settlement cigarette manufacturers reached with New York State and other states as compensation for treating smoking-related illnesses among Medicaid patients.</p>
        <p>The study will be the first large-scale look at how effectively a new generation of X-ray machines, known as spiral CT scanners, can spot lung tumors that are much too small to be seen with a conventional chest X-ray, said Dr. Maria Mitchell, president of Academic Medicine Development Company, a nonprofit consortium of 35 academic health centers, research institutions and medical schools coordinating the statewide project.</p>
        <p>''We hope to determine whether or not this is an effective screening device in finding early-stage cancers, and whether or not there are effective interventions at an early stage,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Michael A. Stocker, the president of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which is giving $1 million to the project, are scheduled to appear with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at a City Hall news conference this morning to unveil it.</p>
        <p>The three-year project is to involve as many as 10,000 men and women 55 or older, most of them from New York City, who smoked on average a pack of cigarettes a day for 10 years or longer, Dr. Mitchell said. Each participant will receive at least two CT scans, which normally cost $300 to $700 and are not covered by most health insurance plans. Participation is free.</p>
        <p>The project is an expansion of a study of 1,000 smokers conducted a few years ago by Dr. Claudia H. Henschke of the Weill Cornell Medical Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital. That study's initial results showed that CT scans were effective in detecting lung cancer earlier than conventional X-ray tests.</p>
        <p>The expanded study will seek to confirm those findings and to determine the value of early detection.</p>
        <p>In search of the $9.7 million needed  to finance a longer-range study, Dr. Mitchell and the deans of several of the city's medical school wrote to Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles, a senior adviser to Mr. Giuliani, and in January the doctors met with the mayor to outline their project, Dr. Mitchell said.</p>
        <p>''The mayor was supportive,'' Mr. Coles said. ''The object of the program is to help as many people as we can to survive lung cancer. I think it's going to save many, many lives in New York City.''</p>
        <p>Twelve research institutions throughout the state will participate in the project, Dr. Mitchell said, including eight in New York City: the New York Weill Cornell Center, Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York Medical College, Sisters of Charity in the Bronx, Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, and Downstate Medical School.</p>
        <p>Three other health centers upstate and one on Long Island will also take part. Dr. Henschke said she would be the project's principal investigator.</p>
        <p>Patients have converged on many radiologists and other doctors who offer the CT scan, hoping to detect potentially deadly tumors as early as possible. Lung cancer is the country's leading cause of cancer deaths, with about 157,000 each year. ''I don't think recruitment is going to be a problem,'' Dr. Mitchell said.</p>
        <p>But the popularity of spiral CT screening is troubling to some doctors, including Dr. Barnett Kramer of the National Institutes of Health, who believe the scans may help cancer detection but do nothing to help patients live longer.</p>
        <p>Despite those concerns, ''Most people believe this is worthy of a trial,'' Dr. Stocker said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 22, 2000, Tuesday  An article yesterday about a medical study of an experimental X-ray screening test for diagnosing and treating early stages of lung cancer paraphrased one doctor's concerns about the test incorrectly. The doctor, Barnett Kramer of the National Institutes of Health, says that although the test, known as spiral CT screening, may help cancer detection, whether it will help patients live longer remains undetermined. He did not say that the test does nothing to help patients live longer.</p>
        <p>The article also included erroneous names supplied by the study's publicists for two participating institutions. They are Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center (not the Sisters of Charity) and Mount Sinai School of Medicine (not Mount Sinai Medical Center).</p>
