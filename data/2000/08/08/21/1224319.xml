        <p>In the Gore camp, there has been much talk about the need to gain separation from President Clinton, to set Al Gore apart as his own man with his own style, message and persona.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, in a most surprising way, Mr. Gore took a step toward doing just that. He did it by becoming more like Mr. Clinton, and he did it, best of all, in a place called Clinton, a small Iowa town set back from the banks of the Mississippi River. There, on the lawn of the county courthouse, Mr. Gore put in a performance more reminiscent of Mr. Clinton's two presidential campaigns than of Mr. Gore circa 2000.</p>
        <p>He arrived hours late, filled his speech with twangy Southernisms, spoke with a populist passion that had the crowd roaring, danced with his wife and then stayed late into the cool summer night to shake every hand he could reach. Normally not known to linger at the rope line, Mr. Gore plunged again and again toward knots of onlookers, posing for group photographs, kissing babies, tweaking a little boy's nose, signing autographs, slapping high fives -- reveling in the crowd in much the same way Mr. Clinton is famous for doing.</p>
        <p>''Are you with me?'' Mr. Gore shouted from the stage. ''Yeah!'' the crowd yelled back.</p>
        <p>In a campaign sometimes notable for staging events with the pizazz of a tax seminar, Mr. Gore's appearance in Clinton was one of his most energetic and effective in more than a year of campaigning. ''My goodness gracious,'' said Mary Ruth Michelson, 70, who waited four hours for a glimpse of Mr. Gore but never expected anything quite so lively. ''What on earth has gotten into him?''</p>
        <p>At the end of his speech, Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper, danced under a spray of confetti, and they looked so loose and natural that one grizzled union organizer in the audience wondered whether the notoriously wooden Mr. Gore had undergone a body transplant. By contrast, Iowa's governor, Tom Vilsack, looked stiff and uncomfortable -- think of the old Mr. Gore -- trying to boogie up on a stage in front of several thousand people.</p>
        <p>Then again Mr. Gore had a slight advantage. Before his arrival in Clinton aboard the riverboat Mark Twain, Mr. Gore had been dancing with gusto during a birthday celebration for his wife on the top deck. In another echo of Mr. Clinton, who was known to cultivate relationships with journalists during his presidential campaigns, the Gores invited reporters to join the festivities in a rare extended off-the-record session.</p>
        <p>A Day for Faith and Family</p>
        <p>In purely political terms, it may not have been the ideal time to take a day off from the campaign trail. Just as Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, were trying to build momentum from the Democratic National Convention, just as they were trying to give their political partnership a memorable national identity, and right as the campaign held the attention of a large traveling press corps, Mr. Lieberman and his family all but disappeared to observe the Sabbath.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman dropped off the campaign trail on Friday afternoon and spent much of the next day in seclusion with his family at the Radisson Hotel in La Crosse, Wis. On Saturday morning, the Lieberman family attended services at Congregation Son's of Abraham, the only synagogue in town. In accordance with their Orthodox faith, which prohibits driving on the Sabbath, the Liebermans walked the mile and a half from their hotel to the synagogue. Accompanied by Secret Service agents and a few aides and reporters, the Liebermans paused along the way to greet residents who came out of their homes to say hello.</p>
        <p>Reporters were allowed inside the synagogue, but cameras, note pads and tape recorders were not welcomed. Mr. Lieberman was invited to read from the Torah, but he avoided making any remarks that could be construed as overtly political, again in accordance with his religious beliefs.</p>
        <p>On the same day, Mr. Gore was winding his way down the Mississippi, delivering forceful, populist stump speeches to thousands of people in small towns and cities where Mr. Lieberman is largely an unknown. Mr. Gore regularly paused to praise Mr. Lieberman, but he never felt the need to explain the reason for Mr. Lieberman's absence, a reflection of his stated desire to incorporate Mr. Lieberman's Orthodox practices into the rhythm of campaigning with as little fanfare as possible.</p>
        <p>''The Sabbath is his private time for his faith and his family, and that's all I'm going to say,'' said Mr. Lieberman's campaign press secretary, Kiki McClean.</p>
        <p>Campaign aides reasoned that regardless of the cost of Mr. Lieberman's being off the national stage one day every week, many voters would admire a display of commitment to religion above political ambition. And there was another benefit: On Friday, Mr. Lieberman's voice was raw and hoarse. This morning, when he rejoined Mr. Gore in Moline, his voice was back to normal.</p>
        <p>Watch for Falling Signs</p>
        <p>For those charged with shaping Mr. Gore's image, his four-day trip down the Mississippi has been a feast of useful symbolism. What better way to convey a politician of mainstream, heartland values than to put him aboard the Mark Twain decorated with red, white and blue bunting?</p>
        <p>But even on this tightly scripted journey, events have sometimes intervened in ways that turned the symbolism upside down. Take Saturday morning in Dubuque, Iowa, where Mr. Gore gave a speech on a low bluff overlooking the Mississippi. At stage right, organizers had erected a huge sign that read, ''Gore Iowa 2000.'' Unfortunately, minutes before Mr. Gore was to take the stage, the ''Iowa 2000'' part of the sign collapsed to the ground with a thud.</p>
