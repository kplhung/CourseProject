        <p>SUE BAILEY, the government's new highway-safety chief, insists she is not obsessive when it comes to safety on the roads. ''I'm not at all an anxious person,'' she says. ''I'm not compulsive.''</p>
        <p>So who, then, was that young mother in Philadelphia in the early 1970's who hired a mechanic to install a seat belt for her son on the bus that ferried neighborhood children to preschool? And who, before child-restraint seats, made one of her own by cutting holes in a plastic child seat so a seat belt could be looped through it to keep her toddler daughter safe?</p>
        <p>Her son, now 31 and an emergency-room physician in suburban Washington, ''will tell you that he still remembers that he was the only one on that little school bus who had to buckle himself in,'' said Dr. Bailey, a psychiatrist, neurologist and public-health specialist who begins work today as the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
        <p>''I was interested way before anybody else seemed to be interested in how to make yourself safe in a vehicle,'' she said, recalling that three decades ago Americans rarely used seat belts, and that her neighbors ''thought I was crazy'' to be so concerned about her children's safety in the car. ''I was probably ahead of Ralph Nader.''</p>
        <p>When the White House announced her appointment to lead the safety agency, ''my family and friends were all laughing,'' she explained. ''They said, 'This is perfect. She's driven us crazy for years about these safety issues in automobiles. Now she can do something about it.' ''</p>
        <p>Dr. Bailey will have no time to ease into her new job at the agency, which is responsible for the safety of the nation's highways, automobiles and tires.</p>
        <p>The agency is under scrutiny after the announcement that millions of Firestone tires are being recalled because of evidence that they are prone to shredding; 62 deaths have been linked so far to separation of the treads on tires that were installed as original equipment on some Ford vehicles. The agency has been criticized by public-safety advocates for failing to properly track accidents involving the tires, and for not forcing Firestone and Ford to do more, faster.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bailey says it is too early for her to discuss the tire recall in detail. But without making judgments about the agency's performance, she says she will review the methods used to monitor tire safety. ''I'm so hesitant to speak about this because this was before my tenure,'' she says. ''But I do want to review our ability to track in a timely fashion, which is part of how we serve the American public.''</p>
        <p>SHE is not new to controversy. During her time at the Pentagon -- she was assistant secretary of defense for health affairs from 1998 until this summer, the first woman to oversee the military health system -- she directed a program to inoculate troops against the anthrax virus, despite reports from some soldiers that the vaccine was unsafe.</p>
        <p>She has no apologies for the program, which was scaled back significantly because of shortages of the vaccine and mismanagement at the company licensed to produce it. ''I knew what we were doing was right,'' she said. ''Anthrax is easily weaponized, it's as deadly as the Ebola virus, and you need protection. We had a safe vaccine. It would have made me uncomfortable to think that there were body bags coming back that I could have prevented.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Bailey, 57, was born Patricia Sue Bailey in Rapid City, S.D., the third of four children. Her father, a physician, dabbled in engineering, and during World War II he worked at a B-17 base in Rapid City and invented a type of compass still common in aircraft today. ''By all rights, my family should be very rich'' on the basis of that invention, she says. ''But we're not, because he did it for the public good. I respect that.''</p>
        <p>When she was 3, the family moved to Washington, so her father could continue his engineering work at Andrews Air Force Base. Of his children, Sue was the one most likely to help her father under the hood of the car. ''I was the one who worked on machinery with him, whether it was the car or the lawn mower or the furnace,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She followed her father into osteopathic medicine, which emphasizes holistic treatments. She graduated from the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and completed her residency in psychiatry and neurology at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She worked in private practice in Washington, raising two children. She is divorced.</p>
        <p>A lifelong, politically active Democrat, she returned home Friday from the party's convention in Los Angeles. She is an eager supporter of Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Gore, she says, will continue the economic expansion that is helping make cars safer. ''It's a luxury to make policy that provides for safety,'' she said. ''If you have a sound economy, corporations are going to be more willing and more able to embrace techniques to make cars safer.''</p>
        <p>Stepping into a car at the airport Friday night for the ride home, she fastened her seat belt. And she looked disapprovingly when she noticed that a passenger had not buckled his.</p>
        <p>She announced -- only half in jest, it seemed -- that the car would stop until he buckled up. ''You're being a danger not only to yourself but to the other people in this car,'' she explained, all but shaking her finger. ''You could be a flying object that would endanger the driver. I'm not going to participate in this ride if you don't put that seat belt on.''</p>
        <p>The passenger hurriedly obeyed.</p>
