        <p>In the often rarefied world of foreign policy treatises, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace is making a bet: that there are plenty of readers interested in a magazine about globalization and how it affects them.</p>
        <p>No longer will Foreign Policy, the 30-year-old publication of the endowment, concentrate on articles about relations between governments, on military policy, or on the domestic politics of an important American ally.</p>
        <p>Instead, the magazine, remade from its elegant slim size into a bigger, flashier format that resembles the celebrity magazine Talk, will concentrate on ''global politics, economics and ideas.''</p>
        <p>The first issue of the remade magazine, which is in the mail to subscribers and will be on the newsstands early in September, poses the question: Would a sudden collapse on Wall Street spark a global 21st century Great Depression? Not necessarily, is the answer. The article, by Martin Wolf, associate editor of the Financial Times, goes on to delineate some likely results: a weaker dollar, a slump in international trade particularly hurting Mexico and Canada, and falling petroleum prices that would severely limit the oil boom in Russia.</p>
        <p>Foreign Policy was founded 30 years ago, partly as an antidote to Foreign Affairs, the more staid, more establishment voice of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.</p>
        <p>The magazine's founders, Samuel P. Huntington and Warren Manshel, thought that an alternative voice was needed to the hawkish views of Foreign Affairs on the Vietnam War. Its initial creed, according to its opening editorial, was to re-examine and redefine American foreign policy as the United States disengaged from Vietnam. Richard C. Holbrooke, currently the chief representative to the United Nations, was its managing editor from 1972 to 1976.</p>
        <p>By focusing Foreign Policy on globalization and the new economy, the editor and publisher, Moises Naim, is making a fundamental change from the founders' emphasis on the American role in world affairs. Indeed, the choice of Mr. Naim three years ago was quite a switch. A Venezuelan who was a trade minister of his country and who had served two stints as a senior official at the World Bank, Mr. Naim took charge of the magazine after the 17-year tenure of Charles William Maynes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Naim -- whose interests span economics, and psychology as well as classic foreign policy -- soon revamped the magazine to make it look more like a literary publication. He livened it up with a Web site, introduced reviews of books published abroad and ran lengthy interviews with figures normally considered offbeat by a serious foreign policy publication.</p>
        <p>The visage of Lori Wallach, a leader of the protests in Seattle last year against the World Trade Organization, beamed out from the cover of the magazine this spring, accompanied by an interview in which she excoriated Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers and the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Naim's initial revamping did not go far enough in satisfying the appetite of an audience he believes wants to know more about how globalization is going to change their lives and businesses.</p>
        <p>He is not so brash as to try to put out a news-you-can-use publication. But in the world of foreign policy he is getting about as close as possible. ''There is a lot of confusion,'' he said. ''Globalization is changing things faster than people, countries or companies can digest or react to, A lot of the anxiety about globalization is rooted in fast-paced changes, and it's not very clear how people are going to come out of this.''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Naim is now directing Foreign Policy to readers who want an understanding of globalization without reading specialist fare. Next month, a lead article ''Sushi Goes Global'' describes how in just a decade a Japanese speciality has become a worldwide phenomenon involving the international regulation of the fish trade. The lead interview will be with Ray Kendall, the head of Interpol, the crime prevention agency, which has become more important in the fight against people-trafficking and other crimes that easily cross borders in the post-cold-war era.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the rival Foreign Affairs has also gone through something of a modernization, but it remains, according to Mr. Naim, the journal of record.</p>
        <p>His magazine's circulation, subsidized by the Carnegie Endowment, is a modest 30,000. With its new content and an extra $1 million investment by the endowment, Mr. Naim thinks he can push that up to 130,000 over the next three years.</p>
        <p>He is not beyond attracting attention. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this year, he gave a talk called the ''Occupational Hazards of Power'' in which he described how some chiefs of Washington, Hollywood and Wall Street suffer from what he called ''narcissistic personality disorder.'' If the size of the crowd that came to hear that piercing criticism is a gauge, Mr. Naim may reach his circulation target.</p>
