        <p>THERE'S no business like show business.'' At least that is what the News Corporation's chairman, Rupert Murdoch, was trying to convince investors of when the company spun off 20 percent of Fox Entertainment Group, its entertainment unit, to the public in November 1998.</p>

        <p>THERE'S no business like show business.'' At least that is what the News Corporation's chairman, Rupert Murdoch, was trying to convince investors of when the company spun off 20 percent of Fox Entertainment Group, its entertainment unit, to the public in November 1998.</p>
        <p>News Corporation's shares were depressed at the time. By spinning off a chunk of entertainment operations, Mr. Murdoch wanted to demonstrate to shareholders that the company's entertainment assets were more valuable than investors were giving News Corporation credit for.</p>
        <p>Did it work? Maybe better for News Corporation shareholders than for Fox shareholders. Since the spinoff on Nov. 11, 1998, stock in Fox Entertainment has climbed 20 percent from its close on its first day of trading, a far smaller increase than other media stocks, including Viacom, The Walt Disney Company, Time Warner, Seagram -- and News Corporation itself, which has risen 85 percent during that period and closed last Friday at $52.4375.</p>
        <p>Though the spinoff of Fox has helped News Corporation, analysts say the company's share price has also benefited from other actions, including the merger of its TV Guide unit with Gemstar Inc. The stock also got a vote of confidence last year when the cable mogul John Malone increased his investment in News Corporation.</p>
        <p>So what's eating Fox Entertainment?</p>
        <p>''It's like the school nurse who is always issuing excuses,'' said Jeffrey Logsdon, a media analyst at WR Hambrecht &amp; Company. ''Every quarter, it's something else. There's always a problem.''</p>
        <p>Take the quarter that ended June 30.  Though revenue rose 25 percent, to $2.47 billion, the company reported earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization of $235 million -- down 4.4 percent from a year earlier. The company attributed the decline to the box-office failure of the movie ''Titan A.E.'' For the full year, net profit was down to $145 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $205 million, or 33 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Fox's key assets include 20th Century Fox, which produces both films and TV programs, and Fox Television, which includes the Fox Network and TV stations, and cable services.</p>
        <p>''They have talked as if good results are around the corner,'' said Christopher Dixon, an analyst at PaineWebber. ''Maybe this time they are.''</p>
        <p>Syndication sales from reruns of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and other TV series  should begin to swell corporate coffers a year from now, Mr. Dixon said.</p>
        <p>News Corporation claims that its problems at the Fox film studio are over, now that there is a new management team in place under the co-chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos.</p>
        <p>Besides looking for Fox's performance to  put a dollar value on News Corporation's entertainment assets, the company may have hoped to use Fox's stock to make acquisitions.</p>
        <p>There was precedent for such optimism. In 1998, CBS spun off what was then 20 percent of its Infinity radio and outdoor advertising business. The spinoff let CBS use Infinity stock to buy additional radio stations and outdoor advertising companies, notably Outdoor Systems, which it bought for $6.5 billion. At that time shares in CBS, perceived as a slower growing network business, traded at a lower multiple than stock in Infinity, whose high cash flow and faster growth made it more attractive to radio station operators and other target companies.</p>
        <p>But since then CBS has merged with Viacom, and that stock has done exceptionally well. So there is no further need for the Infinity currency -- which explains why Viacom said last week it would buy back the Infinity shares it did not already hold.</p>
        <p>News Corporation has not had such good fortune with the Fox spinoff.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reasons, target companies apparently prefer News Corporation stock to Fox stock. Last week when the TV station owner Chris-Craft Industries sold out to News Corporation for stock and cash, Chris-Craft got stock in News Corporation. News Corporation plans to swap the stations to Fox for newly issued Fox stock.</p>
        <p>An acquired company will want shares of the parent company because ''they want the ownership at the level of the guy who runs the company,'' said a News Corporation investor who contends Fox stock has not achieved its goals. ''And they like the asset mix at News Corp. much better.''</p>
        <p>If Fox's performance improves, the bulls will feel vindicated. But if Mr. Murdoch were to decide to buy back stock, those who want to bail out may not like the price.</p>
        <p>There are several cases of media companies spinning off assets and then trying to buy back the shares at a price investors do not find acceptable. Indeed some analysts said last week that Viacom, which is controlled by Chairman Sumner Redstone, might have to raise its bid for Infinity's remaining shares slightly above the equivalent of about $40 a share it offered last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Redstone himself has been on the other side of such transactions. When he owned a stake in MGM Home Entertainment, a company controlled by the financier Kirk Kerkorian, he went to court to sue for a higher price when Mr. Kerkorian tried to buy back the shares at a price Mr. Redstone considered inadequate. Mr. Redstone won.</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Murdoch has revealed no plans to buy Fox shares. But should he decide to make such a move, investors presumably will be comparing his offer not only to the market price at the time, but to the bold predictions made in November 1998.</p>
