        <p>Zeldon Linn has worked on the railroads and in a sawmill. He has been a sergeant in the Army and a mechanic in a garage. At times for the last 15 years he has found work as a fisherman, crabbing and catching salmon in the Pacific Ocean off this struggling blue-collar town along the Oregon coast. At other times, he has found no work at all.</p>
        <p>All of which, he conceded with a laugh the other day, seems like odd preparation for his new job, where he sits in a cubicle each day, fires up a computer, dons a headset and swings into action on the first ring of the telephone.</p>
        <p>''Good morning,'' Mr. Linn says. ''Thank you for calling MSN Technical Support. My name is Zeldon. May I have your e-mail address, please?''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Linn and 345 other people here in remote Coos County, where the historical economic pillars of logging and fishing have been severely battered and where the unemployment rate was in the double digits as recently as last year, an improbable savior has emerged, mushrooming in a matter of months into the second-largest private employer in the county.</p>
        <p>As high-tech companies face an acute shortage of workers in many urban areas, they have begun to branch out to areas of the country that had been passed over by the boom, bringing jobs and training and making inroads on the ''digital divide'' between America's urban and rural regions.</p>
        <p>Here in southern Oregon, the company is CyberRep.com, a Virginia concern that has contracts to provide phone and Internet services for well-known corporate clients. CyberRep workers like Mr. Linn answer the toll-free help lines for the Microsoft Corporation's MSN online service and for Barnes &amp; Noble.com, the online division of the bookseller.</p>
        <p>For places like Coos Bay, once the largest wood-products shipping port in the world, there are some painful twists. These are the back-office jobs of the ''new economy,'' paying $8 to $9 an hour and offering no stock-option bonuses. There is a graveyard shift, because the help lines need to be staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Even with CyberRep set to surpass the Mill Casino, owned by the Coquille Indian tribe, as the area's largest source of private jobs, it will still represent just a fraction of the 3,200 jobs in the wood-products industry that local officials say have been lost in the last 20 years. In many cases those jobs paid, in constant-dollar terms, twice as well as the new ones.</p>
        <p>Still, these are jobs, offering health benefits and computer skills that many workers say they believe are the perfect entry to more lucrative employment. And most of the workers, like Mr. Linn, seem grateful for the work, though they often express ambivalence about the nature of the work and the sweeping economic forces that have taken them out of the woods or off the seas and placed them in small workstations in a boxy warehouse building up the street from the local airport.</p>
        <p>''I miss the ocean,'' said Mr. Linn, 43, a burly, bearded man who still wears work boots to his job. ''There's a feeling of freedom you get there like no place else. Now here I am, confined to this little cubicle.</p>
        <p>''On the other hand,'' he said, his face brightening, ''this is the first job I've ever had where I go to work clean and I come home clean. I've never had a job where I didn't come home smelling like fish or oil.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Linn and other workers at CyberRep described the kick they get from helping frustrated or even irate callers from around the nation facing trouble with their dial-up adapters, modem connections, configuration schemes and all manner of other software and Internet problems. Some callers simply need old-fashioned help, like directions.</p>
        <p>''I'm driving through Kansas right now,'' said a woman named Peggy, speaking on her cell phone, after she called Barnes &amp; Noble's 1-800-THE-BOOK help line and reached Stella Smith, 62, the wife of a retired logger, at her workstation here. ''I'm driving across the country. Do you have a bookstore anywhere near Topeka, Kan.? I'd really like to go to a bookstore.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Smith instantly used her computer mouse to navigate the ''find a store'' function of the Barnes &amp; Noble site to locate the store in Topeka and give Peggy the directions.</p>
        <p>These jobs are not for everybody. Some who have worked around trees or at the port all their lives said they could not imagine being cooped up all day, staring at a computer screen.</p>
        <p>''You put me indoors and I'm lost,'' said George Sjostrom, 59, a wiry man with a chain saw and a hard hat, who shook his head when asked if he might want to trade his job as a log-yard worker for that of a computer-support specialist.</p>
        <p>''I'm out of my world,'' continued Mr. Sjostrom, who tags and sorts giant logs all day with the help of enormous claw-equipped machines that move the logs around the yard as if they were toothpicks, readying them for placement aboard ships at the nearby port or in machines that turn them into wood chips bound for pulp mills. ''I wouldn't have any idea what to do with a computer. If I could figure out the 'on' button, that'd be a big accomplishment for me.''</p>
        <p>At CyberRep, though, many of the workers said they enjoyed computers and several, including Mr. Linn and Mike Armijo, 38, who lost two jobs in recent years when local mills closed, said they had initially taught themselves how to use the machines.</p>
        <p>The jobs have their stressful aspects, perhaps chief among them the constant pressure to satisfy customers while sticking to an average time of roughly nine minutes a call.</p>
        <p>''You walk a fine line,'' Mr. Armijo said. ''You've got to be as caring as you can, but you've also got to get them off the phone as quickly as possible.''</p>
        <p>Workers here trade horror stories about their longest service calls -- 82 minutes here, 74 minutes there -- often involving customers who have completely fouled up their software settings in a bid to solve what began as a much simpler problem. Men are generally more difficult than women, workers of both sexes agree.</p>
        <p>''Men are much more likely to think they know something about computers when they don't,'' Mr. Linn observed. ''But women, I've found, are more willing to say something like, 'I really don't know, I need help.' They'll really listen to you more. So they take less time.''</p>
        <p>Several elements came together to culminate in the deal that brought CyberRep to the call-center building, which is part of the airport office park in North Bend, the neighboring town to Coos Bay. The idea started last year in the mind of John Stadter, then the chief financial officer of 800 Support, a company based in the Portland suburbs that was recently acquired by CyberRep.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stadter grew up on the Oregon coast and had a vacation home near here, in Bandon. So, he explained, he knew something about the area and convinced his initially skeptical colleagues that there was a large, willing and able work force.</p>
        <p>''Some of the smartest people in my high school class went to work in the woods, because that's where the big money was,'' said Mr. Stadter, now the general manager of Coos Bay operations for CyberRep. ''And they're still around here.''</p>
        <p>The Oregon International Port of Coos Bay, which helps broker economic development deals, put together a package of tax incentives and agreed to lease the building. The local Southwestern Oregon Community College provided computer training classes.</p>
        <p>Coos Bay's wood-shipping industry, as well as its fishing, has declined in the face of foreign competition and heightened environmental regulations. While 300 million board feet of lumber were shipped out of Coos Bay annually a decade ago, the number last year was 13.5 million, said Ingvar Doessing, the manager of a local stevedoring company and a member of the port commission.</p>
        <p>The region, 80 miles away from the nearest Interstate, is remote by many measures. Local officials have sought unsuccessfully to attract a steel mill, a pulp mill and a fish-processing plant. They say they are thrilled to have landed a high-tech company.</p>
        <p>''This area has never really participated in the economic boom of the 1990's,'' said Allan E. Rumbaugh, the port's general manager. ''It certainly participated very strongly in the recession of the early 1980's. So this deal has given us a real sense of optimism that we're not the pariah we sometimes worry we are. We can attract a company to come here from out of town. That feels pretty good.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Armijo, the CyberRep support technician, expressed more caution: ''It's been my sad observation that nothing lasts forever around here as a source of jobs. I've never seen anything that permanent.</p>
        <p>''But for now,'' he said, using an analogy that looks back to what was once an economic mainstay, ''I think it's a godsend that this company has come in here. It's kind of like a guy going fishing and reeling in a 1,300-pound tuna. It's unbelievable.''</p>
