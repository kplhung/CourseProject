        <p>The Nets chose Kenyon Martin as the No. 1 pick in the National Basketball Association draft, assured that his broken leg would be healed in time for the season. Last week, Martin passed the first test.</p>
        <p>Playing competitively for the first time since he fractured his right fibula and tore ligaments in his ankle on March 9, Martin excelled at Pete Newell's big-man camp in Hawaii and emerged injury free, Nets officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''We have heard that he played very well,'' Rod Thorn, the Nets' president, said.</p>
        <p>Martin arrives tonight for his routine team physical, which is scheduled for tomorrow. He has signed his rookie contract -- expected to be worth the maximum of $11.4 million for three years -- and the Nets will most likely complete the deal early this week after Martin takes his physical.</p>
        <p>Martin has had an exhilarating two weeks. He married in Hawaii, honeymooned there and then performed impressively at the camp. Last month, after working out on his own for two hours a day in California, Martin said that he was playing his best basketball.</p>
        <p>He will be able to prove that for the Nets when he starts working out at the Nets' facility next month, in preparation for the start of training camp on Oct. 2.</p>
