        <p>Willa Laskowitz letter, commenting on August 16 article, praises New Jersey Supreme Court decision overturning as unconstitutional parent notification law requiring minors to inform parents that they are pregnant before getting legal abortion</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am relieved that the New Jersey State Supreme Court found the parental notification law unconstitutional (news article, Aug. 16), thereby protecting the reproductive freedom of young women like me.</p>
        <p>At first glance, the law may have seemed like a way for teenagers to involve their parents in important decisions, but it would have done just the opposite. There are many young women who do not want to tell their parents that they are pregnant because they suffer from abuse or incest. If forced to inform their parents before obtaining a legal abortion in New Jersey, they may have attempted self-induced abortions or left the state to terminate their pregnancies.</p>

        <p>Reproductive freedoms are a privilege, not a gift. So it is very important that young people realize the possible results if the parental notification law had not been struck down.</p>
