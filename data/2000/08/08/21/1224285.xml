        <p>One of Antonio Vivaldi's ardent admirers was his contemporary Johann Sebastian Bach. In the first third of the 18th century music publishing on an international scale was in its infancy. Bach himself engraved his ''Clavierubung'' on copper plates, serving as his own production team, publicist and marketing director. When Vivaldi's scores made their way to Germany and came before him, Bach either copied them in his own hand or transcribed them, often in different keys and for different instruments. Frequently textures and counterpoint were ''filled out.'' Until a generation ago Vivaldi pieces in Bach's hand were misattributed by musicologists.</p>
        <p>I Solisti Veneti, an Italian Baroque orchestra, came to Avery Fisher Hall as part of the Mostly Mozart Festival on Thursday night. Music by Vivaldi and his great transcriber were interleaved, the evening ending with the Italian's B minor Concerto for Four Violins followed by Bach's version transposed a tone down and using four harpsichords.</p>
        <p>Bach, possessing what was arguably music's most profound mind, might have envied his colleague's easy gallantry and mercurial sense of drama. This indeed was a German who interested himself deeply in French and Italian musical fashions while on the surface leading the life of a provincial northern burgher.</p>
        <p>In the transcriptions one senses Vivaldi's spirit being moved somewhat to the background. But Bach learned much from his innovations, especially the increasing separation of solo parts from orchestra parts. These devices were the beginnings of the virtuoso concerto form as practiced from the end of the 18th century until today. Bach, however, also saw the harmonic implications beneath Vivaldi's high drama and could not resist spelling them out. The result is an imposed density that sounds far more German than Italian.</p>
        <p>Let it first be said that a full house at Fisher Hall loved I Solisti Veneti, and who could argue that this group of about 25 was not an amiable lot to have around for an evening? I could search through lexicons of diplomatic language, but the unavoidable fact is that they were not very good. In the players' favor was a gleaming tutti sound that filled this big hall. No one, furthermore, would begrudge them their florid approach to Baroque style, their modern instruments or even their conductor Claudio Scimone's stagy use of terraced dynamics descending into triple and quadruple pianissimos.</p>
        <p>I Solisti Veneti was founded by Mr. Scimone in 1959, but on Thursday it sounded like a collection of strangers at a first rehearsal. There were safe landings on strong beats, but what happened in between turned out to be anyone's guess.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scimone waved his baton with great elegance and grace but what transpired in front of him was muddle and confusion. The violin soloists came out of the orchestra, and none were technically strong. Francesco Finotti was a dignified keyboard player. Giuseppe Falco's oboe in the Marcello C minor Concerto created a pleasant sound and a lot of shaky rhythmic definition. Yet who of us should complain? The sounds were sweet; the incompetence was almost lovable; and the audience had a very good time.</p>
