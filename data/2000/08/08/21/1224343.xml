        <p>A day after being named New York City's new police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik took the first step to fulfill his pledge to reach out to the city's minority residents, who are among the department's harshest critics.</p>
        <p>Yesterday -- along with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Joseph P. Dunne, the new first deputy commissioner -- Mr. Kerik visited a black church in East New York, Brooklyn, where he asked about 60 congregants to give him a chance to succeed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik also spent the first hours after his appointment meeting patrol officers in the 41,000-member department, visiting precincts in Manhattan and Brooklyn, including the Midtown South Precinct, where he was a rookie officer, and the 50th Precinct, which covers the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where he lives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik, 44, who comes to the nation's largest police force after serving as commissioner of the city's Department of Correction, is being closely watched by community groups and city leaders because of strained relations between the department and blacks and Hispanics.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Kerik's predecessor, Howard Safir, a crime drop that had begun in the early 1990's accelerated, but relations between the police and the city's minority residents worsened after the torture of Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, in a Brooklyn precinct house and the fatal shootings of Amadou Diallo and Patrick Dorismond, both unarmed black men.</p>
        <p>In the visit to the Brooklyn church, the Greater Bright Light Baptist Church on Sutter Avenue, Mr. Kerik vowed to work with community leaders while striving to ensure that officers were respectful of all residents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik, a former undercover detective who won commendations for valor, said that he already had told officers that wrongdoing would be punished. But he also said that mistakes by officers need not inflame relations with the community if there is understanding and respect on both sides.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik told the congregation that in visits yesterday morning to the 33rd and 34th Precincts in Washington Heights, he had advised officers: ''If you do something and you do something by accident, if you do something that you didn't mean and it wasn't intentional, I need to be able to go to the community and say, 'I need help.' ''</p>
        <p>He added: ''In order for me to do that, they've got to believe in you. They've got to trust you. You've got to show them respect. And, I'm sure if you show them that respect, you're going to get the respect back.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik also had something to say to those, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, who were critical of his appointment, though he did not single out anyone by name.</p>
        <p>''I've listened to the naysayers,'' he said. ''I've listened to all the derogatory comments in the last 24 hours. It's somewhat humorous. They don't even know me. They never met me.''</p>
        <p>And he asked the churchgoers to tell others to support him.</p>
        <p>''I want you to tell them one thing: 'Give him a chance,' '' said Mr. Kerik, who, at 12:01 this morning, became the 40th police commissioner in the city in just under 100 years.</p>
        <p>The pastor of Bright Light, the Rev. H. Devore Chapman, said he had briefly spoken with Mr. Kerik before the service, and voiced the concerns of residents about racial profiling and the treatment of young people at the hands of officers.</p>
        <p>''He needs to be establishing rapport with people who have concerns and he seemed to be doing that today,'' said Mr. Chapman, who also oversees a church in Park Slope, Brooklyn. ''I would like to see him reach out to all communities. We have had, for a while, a distance. We've had an insensitivity, and we've had a misconception of our neighborhood and we need to have the right kind of dialogue so these suspicions and fears can be reduced and eliminated.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik's appearance at the church was clearly meant as an attempt to start off on the right foot. The visit was organized Saturday by Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington, who is African-American, and Councilwoman Priscilla A. Wooten, who belongs to Bright Light.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chapman and many church members said they had known and respected the newly appointed deputy commissioner, Mr. Dunne, since the early 1990's, when he was commander of the neighborhood's precinct, the 75th. Therefore, they said, theirs was a community that was willing to listen to Mr. Kerik.</p>
        <p>''This is a community for him to start in, to work with him,'' Ms. Wooten said after the service.</p>
        <p>''We already had a good relationship with police that Joe Dunne brought to this area,'' she said. ''It's just a continuation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, in remarks at the church, said that the new leadership in the department would provide ''a chance to try to improve on things, to do things differently.''</p>
        <p>He also stressed that it was imperative that the community respect the police. ''We have to improve with the way the police deal with the community, and the community has to improve with the way they deal with the police,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik spent the weekend demonstrating his support for rank-and-file officers in the department, where morale has been affected by criticism from some in the community and what many officers see as low wages.</p>
        <p>''I want you to know, as your boss and commanding officer, I support you and understand your job,'' he told about 15 officers at the 50th Precinct station house.</p>
        <p>The officers greeted Mr. Kerik's visit enthusiastically but said he had to stay in touch with those who patrol the neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>''Kerik needs to be attuned to the hardships that the police face every day,'' said Officer Philip Gonzalez, who is retiring next month. ''You can't be behind a desk and know what is going on in the street.''</p>
