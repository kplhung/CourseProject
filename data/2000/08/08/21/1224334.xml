        <p>Vivian and Salvatore Frisicaro were wearing Hillary stickers, but when Representative Rick A. Lazio strode past them at the Pulaski Day parade here this afternoon, they did not voice fist-waving contempt or even just grimace like the longtime Democrats they profess to be.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, the Frisicaros let slip a secret: they were apostates, Lazio fans who had turned against their party's Senate candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>''We need help, economically, medically,'' explained Mrs. Frisicaro, 69, a retired teacher's aide who said she had put on the sticker as a courtesy to a friend who handed it to her here in this Buffalo suburb. ''I think she had her try when President Clinton was in, with the health-care plan. And health care is still going down the tubes.''</p>
        <p>Like the Frisicaros', the political allegiances of Erie County, a classically blue-collar Democratic redoubt in western New York, are not always predictable. The county has increasingly become one of the most crucial swing areas in New York, and if the number of Lazio backers who lined the route today on Harlem Road was any indication, Mrs. Clinton cannot assume the county is a sure thing.</p>
        <p>The Democratic organization here in Erie County is more formidable than any in the state outside New York City, but it has faced some unexpected defeats in recent years. It lost the county executive's office last year and could not stop Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, from winning the county in both 1994 and 1998.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton have identified Erie as vital to their campaigns, and although Mrs. Clinton skipped the parade, which celebrates Polish-Americans by honoring the Revolutionary War hero Casimir Pulaski, she arrived late this afternoon for a visit to an arts festival that followed the parade.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was greeted enthusiastically as she mingled with people before taking the stage to dance a polka with her daughter, Chelsea.</p>
        <p>She also served kielbasa at a food stand, conducting a taste test that compared the local variety with one her campaign had brought from Westchester, her new home county.</p>
        <p>In brief comments to reporters, Mrs. Clinton did not directly address her chances in Erie, though she expressed fondness for the people of the county.</p>
        <p>Her campaign aides disputed the idea that Mr. Lazio had a chance here, saying that wayward white, working-class Democrats like the Frisicaros would return to the fold.</p>
        <p>''It's a swing area that it's important to win, and I'm confident that we will do so,'' said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign. ''We have devoted an enormous amount of time upstate. And we are the only candidate in the race to have an economic plan to bring new jobs upstate.''</p>
        <p>It also might be argued that some of those at the parade could have been smitten by Mr. Lazio because he took time to shake their hands or pose for photos with their children. Still, it was not difficult, in more than 20 interviews with Democrats at the parade to find people leaning toward him.</p>
        <p>''He's New York State-born,'' said Adolph Rakowski, 62, a retired custodian who recalled that the only Republican for whom he had voted in recent years was Mr. Pataki in 1998. ''I don't think that we should have a carpetbagger running. She does not know where western New York is. If she learns where western New York is, maybe we can vote for her.''</p>
        <p>Nearby was Ray Full, 79, a retired painter, who said it would be unthinkable to vote for Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Full said he had supported a Republican in the past -- Representative Jack Quinn, who has close ties to labor -- but would not do so this time. ''Hillary is going to win,'' Mr. Full said. ''Most of the time the Democrats get in around here.''</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters after he marched, Mr. Lazio said the response pleased him. ''If this today is any indication of the level of support that we have in a county that has a Democrat registration edge, we are going to do very well,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Like Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lazio also used the day to express his appreciation for the county and for Polish-Americans, though he seemed to evince a little confusion about geopolitics when he said in a short speech that he had favored Poland's entrance into the North American, rather than North Atlantic, Treaty Organization, or NATO.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and his aides continued to attack a Spanish-language radio commercial that is being sponsored by the Democratic State Committee in support of Mrs. Clinton. The commercial declares that Mr. Lazio has always voted in Congress against the interests of Hispanic people on government spending, the military's use of a bombing range in Puerto Rico and other issues.</p>
        <p>''It is an attempt to bring out the very worst in people,'' Mr. Lazio said of the commercial. ''It's beyond distorting the record -- it's an outright fabrication.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton dismissed his criticism and his demand that the commercial be withdrawn, saying that it was factually correct.</p>
        <p>''National Hispanic groups have given him a zero for his voting record,'' she said.</p>
