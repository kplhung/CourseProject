        <p>BINGHAMTON: E. COLI OUTBREAK  About 3,500 Broome County residents will have to boil drinking water until at least today after samples showed traces of E. coli bacteria, which are sometimes fatal. ''We're just taking precautions,'' the county executive, Jeffrey P. Kraham, said of the order issued in Port Dickinson and Hillcrest. The county has not determined the source or strain of the bacteria. A 5-year-old Binghamton girl is hospitalized with an illness linked to E. coli.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: CITY PARK SURVEY  New York City has more parkland and open public land than any other city in the country, according to a new reference book, but much of it is inaccessible, consisting of marshes, ponds and steep, rocky bluffs. The book, ''Inside City Parks,'' published by the Trust for Public Land and the Urban Land Institute, compares park systems in 25 American cities. About 28,000 acres, or more than a quarter of New York City's five boroughs, consists of open public green space and ponds.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: PHARMACIST SENTENCED  A Brooklyn pharmacist has been sentenced to one to three years in prison for selling more than 60,000 pills, including painkillers and sleeping pills, to drug dealers, the office of Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer announced last week. The pharmacist, Mudassir Ali Khan, 53, was arrested in August 1998 and pleaded guilty to conspiracy in May 1999.</p>

        <p>WATKINS GLEN: SANCTUARY FOR CALF  She narrowly escaped death in a New York City slaughterhouse then roamed the streets of Queens. But now an 8-month-old, 500-pound calf faces a far brighter future on the grounds of an upstate New York animal sanctuary. The calf escaped on Wednesday from Astoria Live Poultry, and was captured nearly 20 blocks away. On Saturday, workers from the Farm Sanctuary, which is about 80 miles southwest of Syracuse, picked up the calf at the animal holding area at Kennedy Airport. The shelter does not buy animals so Aladdin El-Sayed, the owner of Astoria Live Poultry, donated the calf to the city.  (AP)</p>

        <p>NEWARK: MONORAIL CLOSES ON LABOR DAY  Just over four years after it opened, the monorail at Newark International Airport is closing on Sept. 4, Labor Day, for major repairs that are expected to last into the winter. The 30,000 people who take the six- to eight-minute ride on the monorail daily will return to buses for now -- rides that could take 30 to 45 minutes. Fixing cracks and track corrosion caused by cold weather is expected to cost the contractors who built the monorail $25 million.</p>

        <p>ATLANTIC CITY: PART-TIME VOTES  A voting-rights struggle has emerged at the New Jersey shore -- with a twist. While most such debates have involved marginalized members of society, it is the largely affluent owners of second homes at the shore who are demanding a vote in the towns where they pay property taxes. The argument comes down to whether voting rights are based on residency or property ownership. Several states, including Connecticut and Tennessee, allow local governments to decide whether to grant voting rights to nonresident property owners. Local officials and many year-round residents of shore towns oppose changing voting rights in New Jersey, saying that would violate the principle of one person one vote.</p>

        <p>MERIDEN: FEDERAL GRANTS FORFEITED  The city's housing authority was forced to return about $690,000 in federal grants after missing a deadline by which the money had to be spent. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development reclaimed the money after notifying public housing authorities last fall that the money had to be used by March 2000. The Meriden Housing Authority had had the funds since 1997.</p>

        <p>STORRS: ABBIE HOFFMAN'S PAPERS  The writings, F.B.I. surveillance files and even dirty socks of the 1960's radical Abbie Hoffman are now the property of the University of Connecticut. The Hoffman papers and memorabilia were given to UConn this summer by Jack Hoffman, his brother. Abbie Hoffman, the founder of the Yippie movement, committed suicide at 52 in 1989. The collection includes a pair of well-worn red, white and blue socks. Mr. Hoffman had no connection to UConn. The gift was negotiated after Brandeis University, his alma mater, and Clark University, in Mr. Hoffman's hometown, Worcester, Mass., turned down the collection.</p>
