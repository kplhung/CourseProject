        <p>Software programs like Napster and Gnutella have achieved a reputation for fostering a communal spirit of sharing among millions of music-loving computer users.</p>
        <p>The reality may be more selfish.</p>
        <p>Two scientists at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center have surveyed the behavior of anonymous music downloaders on the Internet and have found that, rather than demonstrating a ''from each, to each'' ethos, most Internet users are only taking files and not giving any back to their electronic community.</p>
        <p>The survey of use of the Gnutella system during a 24-hour period this month was conducted by Eytan Adar and Bernardo A. Huberman. They said their research demonstrates that ''free riding'' is the most common behavior.</p>
        <p>The result, they said, is a ''tragedy of the digital commons.''</p>
        <p>For one thing, if only a few users are providing files, they would require inordinate bandwidth to meet all the requests, so the system would be more sluggish than one where all users contributed equally.</p>
        <p>''Since files on Gnutella are treated like a public good and the users are not charged in proportion to their use, it appears rational for people to download music files without contributing by making their own files accessible to other users,'' they wrote. ''Because every individual can reason this way and free ride on the efforts of others, the whole system's performance can degrade considerably -- which makes everyone worse off.''</p>
        <p>The results also indicate that Gnutella may not be immune from the legal challenges facing the Napster service. Unlike Napster, Gnutella has no single database under centralized control. But the researchers found that the core users providing music through Gnutella are a concentrated group.</p>
        <p>''About 25 percent of the Gnutella users serve about 98 percent of the files,'' said Mr. Adar, a Xerox computer scientist who specializes in profiling the Internet. Moreover, the researchers found that 1 percent -- 314 computers -- of the users in their survey provided 40 percent of all files made available during the survey period.</p>
        <p>Those providing music through Gnutella are identifiable to other users by their Internet protocol addresses, so the biggest providers of files could potentially be made targets of a legal action that could cripple the network.</p>
        <p>The Xerox survey was based on the activity of 31,395 computer users who shared 3,019,405 files during a 24-hour period over a weekend earlier this month. The researchers said that there was no way to determine the precise number of Gnutella users but that  they thought they had surveyed a substantial portion of the network.</p>
        <p>The research paper, posted on a Xerox World Wide Web site  (http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl  /groups/iea/papers/gnutella  /index.html), comes during a bitter legal fight between Napster, the most prominent music-sharing system, and the record industry, which says the system is a mass copyright infringement. A federal judge's ruling that Napster must shut down has been temporarily set aside by an appeals court.</p>
        <p>Recording industry representatives said they were studying how to deal with the Gnutella network.</p>
        <p>''We are basically analyzing it now,'' said Cary Sherman, senior executive vice president and general counsel for the Recording Industry Association of America.</p>
        <p>And the behavior of the Gnutella users, the Xerox researchers said, could simply be an artifact of the way large groups function.</p>
        <p>''It's very hard to secure voluntary cooperation in very large groups,'' said Bernardo Huberman, a physicist who is a research fellow at the Palo Alto center. ''I don't know of a single country in the world where taxation is voluntary.''</p>
