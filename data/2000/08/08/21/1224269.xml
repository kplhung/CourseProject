        <p>Re ''Ford Says Firestone Was Aware of Flaw in Its Tires by 1997'' (front page, Aug. 14):</p>
        <p>Bridgestone/Firestone's recent recall of millions of ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires made by replacement workers at the company's Decatur, Ill., plant underscores the safety threat posed by the use of replacement workers during strikes and other labor disputes.</p>
        <p>Union workers are highly skilled and among the most productive in the world. It should come as no suprise that replacing skilled, experienced workers with unskilled, inexperienced workers in a highly technical manufacturing environment might lead to the production of defective and unsafe products.</p>
        <p>Until the United States bans the use of replacement workers during strikes, consumers will face tragedies like those that led to the Firestone recall.</p>
