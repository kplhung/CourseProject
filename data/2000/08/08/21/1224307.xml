        <p>In the last step of a backpedal, his weight on his back -- or right -- foot, as Kerry Collins releases the football it seems more prayer than pass.</p>
        <p>How can something heaved with such disregard for proper technique be calculated, or for that matter, aimed?</p>
        <p>But across several weeks now, it has become apparent that Collins has a process to this kind of pass, even if it lacks procedure.</p>
        <p>The most remarkable quality of the Giants' preseason so far has been the almost cosmic union developing between Collins and wide receiver Amani Toomer -- a kinship that defenses have found difficult to stop because the two improvise so well.</p>
        <p>Collins will be on the run, leaning the wrong way, and will suddenly hoist a pass in Toomer's direction. Toomer, sensing Collins's intent, will spin in the right direction even before Collins has lofted the ball, then run under the pass -- often behind the last defender and into the end zone.</p>
        <p>This combination of perfect throw and perfect catch was on display again in Friday night's Giants loss to the Jets, when Collins, pressured in the pocket, sailed a pass 50 yards down the middle of the field.</p>
        <p>As the ball tailed to the right, Toomer drifted in that direction, smoothly settling under the pass in stride as it fell into his arms. He ran untouched into the end zone, a 73-yard touchdown. It was the second Collins-to-Toomer touchdown pass of the preseason, a continuation of late last season when Collins became the starter and threw four touchdown passes to Toomer.</p>
        <p>But they are not merely touchdowns, there are also long, quick strikes, exactly the kind of backbreaking plays the Giants have lacked for several seasons.</p>
        <p>It is the work of a receiver who never gives up on his pass patterns, certain that Collins might yet find a way to get him the ball. It is the work of a quarterback who does not fret about gambling with a risky throw, confident someone tall and fleet like Toomer will find a way to get to the ball.</p>
        <p>''With Kerry you just keep running, because you never know what will happen,'' Toomer said, a smile on his face as he described their relationship last week. ''He's a gunslinger back there. If you're open deep, he's got the arm to get it there.''</p>
        <p>Collins said it was Toomer who was making him look good.</p>
        <p>''He's got a great ability to change his body position and adjust to the ball in the air,'' Collins said.</p>
        <p>What Collins and Toomer are describing is the kind of affinity created in months of practice, skills honed not only this summer but last winter. In February and in March, Collins, Toomer and the Giants' other prime receivers, Ike Hilliard and Joe Jurevicius, would bundle up in the locker room then make the 150-yard walk across a Giants Stadium parking lot to the indoor practice facility. Inside, they would shed the extra clothing and get to work on pass routes and the kinds of throws that work best for each.</p>
        <p>''A lot of it is confidence,'' Collins said. ''With Amani and I, over time I can convince him, 'Hey, just go, I'll get it there.' ''</p>
        <p>In another way, usually on underneath passes, Collins turns to Hilliard even more frequently. And the maturation of Jurevicius, now in his third year, is also plainly evident. On Friday, Jurevicius -- Collins's former teammate at Penn State and probably his closest friend on the team -- made two receptions in traffic, a 30-yard pass from Collins and a leaping 15-yard touchdown grab on a pass from the backup quarterback, Jason Garrett.</p>
        <p>As for Collins's occasionally unusual passing methodology -- throwing off his back foot -- he said it was not planned and not recommended when trying to fire a crisp, sharp pass.</p>
        <p>''But it seems to help me get some touch on the ball,'' said Collins, apparently not quite aware that 40- or 50-yard passes are not commonly thrown with touch.</p>
        <p>But it is a handy technique on the run, something Collins needed Friday, which was the first preseason game this season that Collins was sacked and knocked around in the pocket.</p>
        <p>How Collins will behave and throw the ball under pressure is one of the major question marks of the Giants' season. On Friday, Collins completed 16 of 28 passes for 275 yards. He had an interception, but it was on a desperation, end-of-the-half, jump-ball-type pass into the end zone.</p>
        <p>In three preseason games, Collins has completed 41 of 65 passes, or 63 percent, for 502 yards, 4 touchdowns and 2 interceptions.</p>
        <p>''I feel more comfortable than I ever have,'' Collins said. ''It's just the preseason but I feel like I'm getting things off on the right foot.''</p>
        <p>Or back foot.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Giants waived 13 players and signed a free-agent tight end yesterday. Few of the players waived were familiar names, except perhaps for FRED LEWIS, the rookie cornerback whose fumble after an interception late in the Jacksonville preseason game led to a quirky loss. Lewis was tackled by a teammate, JACK GOLDEN, who will almost certainly survive all the cuts this month. Also waived yesterday: running back OMAR BACON; quarterback BILL BURKE; defensive linemen LAVELL ELLIS, CARL HANSEN, FAIVA TALAEAI and CEDRIC PITTMAN; guard JOHN KUSORA; tight end MARK THOMAS; safety B. J. WILLIAMS; linebacker VERNON STRICKLAND; and wide receivers ANTHONY TUCKER and JEREMY WATKINS. The Giants signed the rookie tight end BRODY HEFFNER-LIDDIARD, a free agent from Colorado who was released by the Minnesota Vikings last week. Heffner-Liddiard, who caught 45 passes at Colorado last season, is 6 feet 4 inches and 234 pounds and also has experience as a long snapper.</p>
