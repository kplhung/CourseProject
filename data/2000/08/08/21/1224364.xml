        <p>D. Wayne Lukas was furious after this afternoon's Grade I Ballerina Handicap. But after watching replays of the race, the winning trainer, Bill Mott, was not sure why.</p>
        <p>With one furlong left in the seven-furlong sprint for fillies and mares, Mott's Dream Supreme, under the jockey Pat Day, barged through a tiny hole between Lukas's Cash Run and the race's second favorite, Bourbon Belle. Cash Run, who appeared to be tiring, banged off Dream Supreme, then pinballed back toward the rail, impeding the late run of Honest Lady, the even-money favorite.</p>
        <p>Dream Supreme never looked back. The 3-year-old dark bay daughter of Seeking the Gold and the Dixieland Band mare Spinning Round powered to a two-and-a-quarter-length victory over Country Hideaway, who in turn had three-quarters of a length on the third-place finisher, Bourbon Belle. Honest Lady was another length and a quarter back in fourth. Cassidy, Cash Run, Tropical Punch, Debby d'Or and Joana Alegre completed the order of finish.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Lukas claimed foul.</p>
        <p>''If we're going to let them bang off each other in the stretch, 150 yards from the wire, we've got to know that, so we can turn them loose and tell them to get a little tougher and run over each other,'' Lukas said after a long phone conversation with the stewards after they decided to leave the order of finish unchanged.</p>
        <p>Lukas, whose last 22 starters here have failed to reach the winner's circle, seemed most upset that the stewards waited until his claim of foul to start an inquiry. But the jockeys and other trainers did not see it the way Lukas did, and felt the problem was caused by Cash Run, who won the Breeders Cup Juvenile Fillies race last fall, and not by Dream Supreme.</p>
        <p>''Cash Run was the filly that caused the traffic trouble, not us,'' Day said.</p>
        <p>After viewing a head-on replay of the race, Mott said, ''It looked more like Cash Run was looking for a spot to get out of the way.''</p>
        <p>Jerry Bailey, Honest Lady's jockey, said his horse ''got stopped pretty cold.'' He said he wasn't sure Honest Lady would have won if her progress had not been impeded, but he absolved Dream Supreme.</p>
        <p>''I just didn't think the winner did it,'' Bailey said. ''I thought the 1 horse'' -- referring to Cash Run -- ''did it.''</p>
        <p>Lukas, normally poker faced in defeat, could be seen having a spirited discussion with Bailey about the race long after it was over.</p>
        <p>''But he's a competitive guy,'' Mott said of Lukas. ''Maybe two weeks from now, if he looks at it again, maybe he wouldn't make the same call.''</p>
        <p>Lukas is having a tough meet. Although the Lukas barn does have eight seconds and nine thirds, Lukas has saddled only one winner in 34 starts here this summer. Meanwhile, Mott's nine victories for the meet, in 45 starts, tie him with Mark Hennig for second in the Saratoga trainer standing, one victory behind Todd Pletcher.</p>
        <p>Today's victory was the fifth in seven career starts for Dream Supreme, who is owned by George Steinbrenner's Kinsman Stable.</p>
        <p>''The filly ran a huge race today,'' Mott said. ''When Pat pushed the button, there was plenty of horse there and she had everyone else at her mercy. I don't really think she cost Cash Run anything. And Jerry was going up in a tight spot to begin with.''</p>
        <p>The victory was Dream Supreme's second in 22 days here. She also won the Grade I Test for 3-year-olds on July 29.</p>
        <p>''I did have some reservations about running her in here, because she is a 3-year-old filly coming back in three weeks,'' Mott said. ''But we started looking at the options, and I really wasn't satisfied with any of the others.''</p>
        <p>After Dream Supreme covered the seven furlongs in a lively 1 minute 22.97 seconds, all of Mott's reservations disappeared.</p>
        <p>Shug McGaughey, the trainer of second-place Country Hideaway, had a few reservations of his own about the way the race unfolded. ''It would have been nice if they would have changed the numbers,'' said McGaughey, referring to both the stewards and the traffic jam in the lane. ''But we were not affected by it, so I can't yell and scream about it.''</p>
