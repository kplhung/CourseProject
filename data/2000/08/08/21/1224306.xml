        <p>The punches from the featherweight champion Naseem Hamed came so fast that even if you were staring at Hamed's hands, you missed them. One man blindsided by their speed was Hamed's opponent, Augie Sanchez.</p>
        <p>It was the fourth round of Hamed's World Boxing Organization title defense late Saturday night, and Hamed threw a three-punch connection. Or was it four? With a Hamed fight, replay is a necessity because the eyes play tricks.</p>
        <p>The punches were actually a left, then a right, then a left. They were enough to end the fight with 2 minutes 34 seconds left in the round and send Sanchez toward the canvas. Then Hamed threw a final right for good measure -- a bone-crunching blow that, as it connected with Sanchez's head, could be heard throughout the arena at Foxwoods Resort Casino.</p>
        <p>Sanchez was knocked almost unconscious and, as a precaution, spent the night at a hospital. A hospital spokeswoman said Sanchez was released early this morning and was in good condition.</p>
        <p>So what is worse? Getting hit by a 250-pound National Football League linebacker or by a punch from the 126-pound Hamed? Neither is pleasant.</p>
        <p>The Sanchez fight showed the two sides of Hamed. He displays scary punching power, which ranks among the best of the lighter boxers. That power, along with his speed, is the main reason Hamed is 35-0 with 31 knockouts and 15 title defenses in five years.</p>
        <p>The flip side is the meatball Hamed, the showboat who sometimes sacrifices his boxing skills for showmanship. His entrance to the fight consisted of chants in Arabic, rap music and dancing. The only thing missing from Hamed's introduction was Elvis impersonators. But they were at the fight as well, brought by Sanchez, who was born in Las Vegas. So Hamed was not the only showoff.</p>
        <p>Sanchez (26-2) got serious once the fight began, while Hamed was still playing the ham. In the second round, Hamed was knocked down, though it was ruled a slip by the referee, Michael Ortega. And by the fourth round, Hamed was bleeding from the mouth and nose and had a swollen left eye.</p>
        <p>Yet each time Hamed was knocked down or hit hard, he would smile at Sanchez, indicating he was not seriously hurt and displaying a toughness that complements his boxing skills.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what other fighters do,'' Hamed said after the fight, ''but when I get hit and go down, I smile and I say, 'I'm going to hit you harder than you hit me, and I'm going to knock you out.' The times I go down and get back up -- that's when I'm the most dangerous.''</p>
        <p>Hamed is at a critical stage in his career. First, he faces a mandatory title defense on Nov. 4 against Koko Kovacs, possibly in Britain.</p>
        <p>Then there could be two big opportunities to increase his presence in the United States. So far, boxing fans here have not flocked to watch Hamed.</p>
        <p>Early next year, Hamed could make his American pay-per-view debut against the 122-pound Marco Antonio Barrera, a top junior featherweight. Then in May, Hamed might fight the undefeated Erik Morales, who would be one of his tougher opponents.</p>
        <p>What Hamed is trying to do now is gain more respect from his critics, many of whom do not rank him among the top 10 featherweights in boxing history despite his record and number of title defenses.</p>
        <p>Hamed also wants to gain more fans in America, but to do so, he knows he needs to fight better opponents.</p>
        <p>Hamed has not demonstrated much maturity in the ring. He often fools around with his opponents, like a puppy playing with a new toy, before he finally gets serious.</p>
        <p>''I will prove myself in America,'' he said. ''I agree that some of my performances in America, apart from having drama and excitement, have been a little under my estimation for performance.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Hamed continues to be one of the most exciting boxers in the sport. With those speedy hands, he can't help but be.</p>
