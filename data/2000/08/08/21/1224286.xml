        <p>Large, ambitious projects often have their origins in seemingly inconsequential small moments. For the British conductor John Eliot Gardiner, it was a glance at a program of a concert he was about to present in 1996.</p>
        <p>''I read in my own C.V. that I was due to record all the cantatas of Bach, and it struck me as very odd because I didn't know about it,'' he recalled. Even by his own industrious scheduling standards -- he already has more than 150 CD's to his name -- he computed that he would have to live to 120 to complete the task.</p>
        <p>But Sir John, who is 57, found the challenge tantalizing, and the solution turned out to be characteristically bold: perform and record them all in one year, 2000, the 250th anniversary of Bach's death.</p>
        <p>Thus was born the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, a 12-month odyssey of more than 60 concerts by Sir John's masterly early-music groups, the Monteverdi Choir and the English Baroque Soloists. They are playing all 198 surviving sacred cantatas in the most architecturally rich churches, monasteries, priories and cathedrals across 14 European countries and the United States, where the tour ends on New Year's Eve at St. Bartholomew's Church.</p>
        <p>The places chosen were those Bach had some association with, some he might have visited if he had had the chance and others, like the 15th-century abbey with its towering Norman pillars here in this medieval town in the west of England, that made the cut for their sheer reverential beauty. The performance dates through the year correspond to the Sundays and feast days for which each cantata was created, based on its own piece of liturgy.</p>
        <p>One of the leaders of the early-music movement that took root in England in the 1970's and 80's, Sir John combines taskmaster discipline and intellectual rigor with the energy to produce brisk, toe-tapping Bach, full of thrusting attacks and swaying rhythms. Now his expressive hands are tamping down the sound; now shaping the full parabola of a serpentine line; now tripping the cadence into dance time; and then sending bass notes plunging down to the crypt and soprano tones soaring upward to the fan vaulting of the sanctuary.</p>
        <p>Though Bach is best known now for his grand masterpieces like the ''St. Matthew Passion'' and the B minor Mass, it was the 340 cantatas composed during his five years, starting in 1723, as cantor at the Thomaskirche in Leipzig that drew the most notice when he died on July 28, 1750. ''They were the only pieces of music noted in the first paragraph of his obituary,'' Sir John said.</p>
        <p>For Bach it was a frantic period of exalted creativity and commonplace drudgery that delights the musical historian in Sir John.</p>
        <p>He said: ''Bach would sit down on Monday morning at his desk and think: 'What's the gospel, the epistle of next Sunday? What can I write about this? I have to do it to bolster the sermon. Who's going to be preaching? What's he going to be saying? How am I going to negotiate with him? And how am I going to do something that makes his words redundant?' ''</p>
        <p>He chuckled at this last notion. ''I'm sure that was a part of it,'' he said. ''He believed his music was going to be more effective than any amount of words.''</p>
        <p>Sir John wasn't finished with the busy week in the Leipzig life of Johann Sebastian Bach: ''Not only does he have to compose the piece, he has to have it copied. So he gets the family factory going, with his wife, Anna Magdalena, and his various sons. And then he has to start rehearsing with the kids of the Thomas school and assign the obbligato and the soloists, and he's pretty merciless about throwing very difficult arias at kids who may not have the technical wherewithal to sing them in an accomplished way.</p>
        <p>''He's quite uncompromising, but at the same time he's very practical in a way. You can sense where he's got a virtuoso trumpeter or viola da gamba player, and he writes something very elaborate. Or other times when he seems to say, 'O.K., we know the boys can't really cope with a florid line here, so we'll give them just the hymn tune and leave the men to do the more elaborate polyphonic line.'</p>
        <p>''That's the sort of usual week, then you have the festivals that come thick and fast, like Christmas, Easter, Whitsun and other saints' days where he has to double, triple, quadruple his output as composer and also to conduct. And the music doesn't stop when the ink is dry. Because then you turn the page, and it's Monday morning and time for a new piece.''</p>
        <p>This short and intense period of conveyer-belt cantatas produced pieces that were performed only once in Bach's lifetime. But for Sir John they are works for the ages.</p>
        <p>''It is a paradox,'' he said, ''but this music written for a very parochial, even sectarian audience for a specific Sunday in the church year carries with it an extraordinary message of universality that seems to leap over frontiers and time barriers, and we are finding people today responding to it in a very refreshing and direct way.''</p>
        <p>''Operatic'' is a word that recurs in Sir John's discussion of the cantatas. ''On the one hand you can call the cantatas almost sermons in music, but in another sense they're minioperas,'' he said. ''People sometimes ask me what kind of opera composer Bach would have been, and I say, 'We already know.' ''</p>
        <p>Sir John's musical sensibility was established early in life, thanks to an upbringing of startling originality. ''Looked at with outside eyes, my childhood must seem very peculiar and eccentric,'' he said. ''But then to me it seemed totally normal.''</p>
        <p>He was reared on a farm in Dorset that was the centerpiece of a postwar rural reinvigoration plan initiated by his great-uncle, Balfour Gardiner, a composer who gave up writing music in the 1920's, and his father, Rolf. They planted four million trees and revived guilds, old harvest rites and farm holidays. His mother, Marabel, an art historian, was, he said gleefully, ''even a bit more wacky and eccentric.'' She taught young John Eliot to speak French, German and Latin by the time he was 8, and she gave him art instruction by taking him to Rome, Florence and Venice. ''She knew them stone by stone and painting by painting,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On Sundays and holidays she would round up family members, visitors and villagers and stage mimed Nativity and Resurrection plays or dramatized Nordic and Celtic sagas. They also sang masses and motets, and by the time he went away to boarding school, he was playing violin and viola, turning his tenor voice to the lieder repertory and dabbling in conducting.</p>
        <p>When Sir John went to King's College, Cambridge, on a history scholarship, everyone assumed he would become a chorister. But he said he found the treatment of English music ''precious, polite and mannered'' in comparison with the robust approach he had learned at home. His majors were medieval Spanish and classical Arabic, but he showed such interest in music that his tutor recommended that he take a year and explore his conducting ambitions.</p>
        <p>He decided to devote the time to studying the background of Monteverdi's 1610 Vespers of the Blessed Virgin and preparing an updated edition of them. To do so he created a choir, his present-day Monteverdi Choir, and performed the work in the King's College chapel. This March, 36 years later to the day, he performed three Bach cantatas there in a triumphant return concert.</p>
        <p>After studying with Nadia Boulanger in Paris, he took conducting posts in Lyon, Hamburg and Vancouver. But he always kept the Monteverdi group intact back in England, and in 1978 he added the English Baroque Soloists. He is said to be good at glowering at laggard performers and flinging music stands across rehearsal spaces, but his singers and players have remained loyal, with two of the choir members reaching their 35th year with the group.</p>
        <p>His former wife, Elizabeth Wilcock, was first violinist with the English Baroque Soloists, and though they are divorced, they remain friends. She and the couple's three daughters rushed to embrace Sir John moments after the Tewkesbury Abbey concert on July 16.</p>
        <p>For the last four years he has shared his homes in London and on the family farm in Dorset with Isabella de Sabata, 40, an Italian from a musical family who worked for years as a press representative for Deutsche Grammophon in London and Hamburg and who is handling much of the planning of the current odyssey.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Grammophon was originally going to make discs of all 198 surviving cantatas, but when they cut back on the number, Sir John and Ms. de Sabata decided to produce their own professional recordings of every performance. A specially built mobile studio van arrives the day before they do at each site to set up wiring and equipment, and rehearsals and post-performance run-throughs are often recorded to make sure that substitute material is on hand for editing.</p>
        <p>Prince Charles is the patron and a contributor to the project, which is also supported by other private donations and corporate grants. He and Sir John are friends, sharing a passion for organic farming as well as music, and the prince has organized fund-raising dinners at Buckingham Palace and his Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire. The project is still $1.5 million shy of the $8.25 million needed.</p>
        <p>Sir John said the pilgrimage fulfilled his original purpose in becoming a full-time musician.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to confront and come to terms with the great heritage of European music, which in the 1960's and 70's was very selectively performed,'' he said. ''It was the precursors to the great masterpieces that fascinated me. The historian in me wanted to know what the function of that music was, what brought it into being, for whom was it composed, in what sort of building would it have been performed, to what kind of audience, in what kind of acoustics with what sort of instruments. It wasn't nostalgia or antiquarianism. I saw it as musical archaeology.''</p>
        <p>As his yearlong musical dig goes on, Sir John says he is finding his time well spent. ''Bach,'' he said, ''is probably the only composer whose musical output is so rich, so challenging to the performers and so spiritually uplifting to both performer and listener alike that one would gladly spend a year in his exclusive company.''</p>
