        <p>By now, after winning three straight league championships, the Houston Comets might seem blase about a chance at a four-peat. Not so today against the Los Angeles Sparks, who were left stunned at being swept from the Western Conference finals by a Houston team they dominated in the regular season.</p>
        <p>The Comets were as gritty in victory as they were giddy in celebration, knocking off the Sparks, 74-69, with clutch shooting and defense in the final minute to win the series, 2-0. As Janeth Arcain, the Comets' unlikely star, clinched Houston's fourth consecutive trip to the Women's National Basketball Association finals with three free throws, her teammates gleefully danced around as though they were experiencing something new.</p>
        <p>''This is just one step closer to our ultimate goal, but winning never gets old,'' Cynthia Cooper said with a huge smile.</p>
        <p>Cooper, who has announced her plans to retire after these finals, led the Comets with 29 points. Arcain, averaging only 8 points in the playoffs, scored 16 points on 6-of-8 shooting. Tammy Jackson came off the bench to add 12 points.</p>
        <p>Houston won despite a poor game from Sheryl Swoopes, the W.N.B.A.'s Most Valuable Player, who became nauseous and dizzy in the locker room before the game. She finished with 8 points, but handed out 6 assists.</p>
        <p>The Comets will play either the Liberty or the Cleveland Rockers, who are tied at one game apiece in the Eastern Conference finals. The deciding game is Monday night.</p>
        <p>The last professional sports team to win four straight championships was the National Hockey League's Islanders, who won four Stanley Cups from 1980-83.</p>
        <p>''As far as the game goes, you have to tip your hat to Houston,'' Los Angeles Coach Michael Cooper said. ''That's why they're the three-time defending champions. They know what it takes to win. They made the necessary plays toward the end to pull this one out.</p>
        <p>''I loved our effort. I thought there were some things that we could have done, some shots that didn't go in that normally fall for us, but that's the way it goes. We wish them well.''</p>
        <p>The Sparks trailed, 67-64, with three minutes to play, but Tamecka Dixon sank a 3-pointer to tie the score. After the teams traded baskets, the Comets delivered two key plays.</p>
        <p>With 39 seconds remaining, Arcain provided the game-winning basket, drilling a running jumper as the shot clock ticked below three seconds to give Houston a 71-69 lead. With 22 seconds left, Jackson provided the game-saving play, swatting away DeLisha Milton's short jump shot, which could have tied the score.</p>
        <p>''I just tried to stay whichever way Milton went,'' Jackson said. ''She's good going to both sides. It was an opportunity that presented itself, and I was there to block her shot.''</p>
        <p>Cynthia Cooper said: ''Can you pick a better time to block a shot? Wow, that was something.''</p>
        <p>Arcain then made three of four free throws to finish the Sparks, who had beaten the Comets in each of their three meetings en route to a league-best 28-4 record during the regular season.</p>
        <p>The Sparks also lost on the day Cooper was honored as the W.N.B.A.'s Coach of the Year in a pregame ceremony.</p>
        <p>''They were probably determined not to lose to us again,'' said Lisa Leslie, who had 12 points and 14 rebounds for the Sparks. ''I think it's really hard to judge based on one or two losses that we're not a championship-caliber team. We feel like we did a great job this year. We just lost to a very good and very experienced team.''</p>
        <p>Mwadi Mabika led the Sparks with 19 points, Dixon scored 17 and Milton added 12. Although the Sparks had a 34-25 edge in rebounds, they were held to 35.4 percent shooting, making only 23 of 65 attempts.</p>
        <p>Houston made 29 of 59 shots, 49.2 percent.</p>
        <p>The Comets quickly established that their 77-56 romp in Game 1 in Houston was not a fluke. That loss last Thursday was the Sparks' worst this season, but today they broke to a 12-6 lead. The Comets answered with a 12-0 run and led by as many as 9 points in the first half.</p>
        <p>''We just had a lot more experience, especially in the last two minutes,'' Arcain said. ''That's why we won.''</p>
        <p>Swoopes said: ''The satisfying part was that we beat them once at home and once here. I'm sure Michael Cooper's award had them fired up and excited, but we hung in there, played well and got the job done.''</p>
