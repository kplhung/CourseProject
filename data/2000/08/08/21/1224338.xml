        <p>Yesterday's playoff game between the Cleveland Rockers and Liberty was not staged on the court in Madison Square Garden, but in the ring.</p>
        <p>''We just wanted to throw the first punch,'' said Liberty forward Vickie Johnson, who had ice bags on her sore left shoulder and sprained right ankle after the battle, which the Liberty won, 51-45. ''The thing we wanted to do was send a message in Madison Square Garden, our home. They want to talk about physical, we'll be physical.''</p>
        <p>Having lost the first game of the Eastern Conference finals by yielding to the board-crashing, body-blocking Rockers, the Liberty was determined not to be bullied again. Facing elimination in the two-of-three-game series, the Liberty drove straight into the Rockers in the first half, pummeling them into submission and leaving them scoreless for an 11-minute stretch that helped give the home team a 19-point halftime lead.</p>
        <p>But in the second 20 minutes, the Liberty players hung on in desperation. They scored only 15 points while earning two technical fouls. While the technicals may have served as badges for the players' wounded pride, they were barely able to outlast the surging Rockers.</p>
        <p>''We're still alive,'' said the Liberty's Teresa Weatherspoon, who screamed to the crowd of 15,865 all afternoon and also earned one of the technical fouls. ''That's what counts. We're alive.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty evened the series and forced tonight's game in the Garden for the right to play the Houston Comets, the three-time defending champions, in the Women's National Basketball Association finals.</p>
        <p>The Liberty has won 12 straight on its home court, three of them at the Rockers' expense. Cleveland's Merlakia Jones, who scored 14 of her 18 points in the second half, said that her team's late effort gives it confidence going into tonight.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be an all-out war,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>Her prediction could have stemmed from an incident late in the game. After coming away with a steal, Weatherspoon was incensed with the attitude from the Rockers' 6-foot-7-inch rookie center, Ann Wauters, a 19-year-old from Belgium. Weatherspoon said Wauters was staring her down, walking toward her as if to antagonize her.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to back down from anyone,'' Weatherspoon said. ''That's not my style. If you're in my home, too, for a youngster to walk in my face, I'm not taking it from anyone.''</p>
        <p>Weatherspoon practically challenged Wauters to spar, which resulted in a technical for the Liberty guard.</p>
        <p>The Liberty's combative attitude was clear from the game's opening minutes. With the Liberty trailing, 5-2, Johnson drove through the lane and drew a foul from Mery Andrade, the Rockers' enforcer. Later in the first half, the Liberty was able to take Andrade out of the game for a while when she sprained her right thumb in a collision with Tamika Whitmore.</p>
        <p>Andrade left at 9 minutes 13 seconds to get X-rays. In her absence, the Liberty launched a 19-0 run to take a 24-7 lead, and the Rockers could not recover. During that stretch, the Rockers missed 17 straight shots. For the first half, the Liberty shot 57.1 percent from the field and took a 36-17 lead into the locker room.</p>
        <p>In the second half, the Liberty began playing on the fumes of its emotion, rather than relying on rebounding and defense. ''We got a little relaxed and lost focus,'' Johnson said. ''I think it was like we were trying to kill them, trying too much, and sometimes it works against you. We just needed to settle down and play Liberty basketball.''</p>
        <p>While this was the physical play the Rockers expected, Andrade, who played 26 minutes yesterday and was expected to play tonight, said she was surprised that some Liberty players reacted the way they did.</p>
        <p>''They have veteran people on that team that should not act the way they act,'' she said. ''The way we were aggressive, it wasn't in a mean way to get people hurt. And if you notice, nobody got a technical foul on Cleveland.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty's Crystal Robinson earned a technical foul because she thought Andrade was the one trying to inflict pain with dirty play.</p>
        <p>''Andrade gets you away from the ball, just with elbows in the throat, and she trips you,'' Robinson said. ''You try to run, she clips you with her feet. I had had enough of it. I told the referee if he didn't stop it, I would do something about it.''</p>
        <p>Robinson added a few ''choice words'' to that statement and was assessed a technical with 11:23 to play. At that point, the Liberty led, 43-28, but started to let the lead slip. Down the stretch, Tari Phillips steadied the Liberty, finishing the game with 12 points and 6 rebounds.</p>
        <p>Becky Hammon, who led the Liberty with 13 points, made two foul shots, and her jumper with 6:22 to play kept the lead at 11 points. The Rockers missed three 3-pointers in the final 1:53, and the battle was extended to another game.</p>
