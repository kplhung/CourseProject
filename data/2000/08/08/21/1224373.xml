        <p>Facing a courageous challenger who refused to give in, the world's best golfer showed the world just how good he is.</p>
        <p>Winning his third consecutive major championship, and winning his second consecutive P.G.A. Championship, Tiger Woods prevailed by one stroke in a three-hole playoff against Bob May, ending a day overflowing with spectacular golf.</p>
        <p>Woods became only the second player to win three majors in one year, joining Ben Hogan, who won the Masters, the United States Open and the British Open in 1953. Woods also became the first back-to-back winner at the P.G.A. Championship since Denny Shute won the P.G.A. title in 1936 and 1937.</p>
        <p>But Woods's year has been even more dominant than Hogan's year in 1953. Woods won this year's United States Open by a record-setting 15 strokes, he won the British Open by eight strokes, and today, Woods and May set the P.G.A. Championship scoring record (18-under-par 270), breaking the previous mark of 17 under par set by Steve Elkington and Colin Montgomerie in 1995.</p>
        <p>Incredibly, Woods holds the scoring record at all four major championships -- the Masters (18 under par), the United States Open (15 under par), the British Open (19 under par) and the P.G.A. Championship (18 under par). At 24, he has won five career majors faster than anyone, and he is the first player in history to win four of five majors, dating to last year's P.G.A. Championship.</p>
        <p>Yet, hardly anyone expected what happened today -- Woods being pushed to the brink of defeat by a 31-year-old, relatively obscure player, who had never won a PGA Tour event, let alone a major championship. But when May made him play his best, Woods was brilliant. Woods forced the playoff by making a pressure-packed 5-foot birdie putt at No. 18, then he closed the playoff by making a wonderful up and down from the greenside bunker at No. 18 to protect his one-shot lead.</p>
        <p>That bunker shot came after his tee shot hit a tree and dropped nearly straight down onto a cart path. The ball bounced so high it hit the tree again. It landed on the cart path and sped down a hill onto trampled grass. His second shot landed in the rough, with his third shot going into the bunker.</p>
        <p>An extraordinary effort by May was not enough to defeat the game's most extraordinary player. Woods could not remember being tested more severely.</p>
        <p>''This was probably one of the greatest duels I've ever had in my life,'' Woods said. ''It was a memorable battle, and I enjoyed it. It was a very special day, to have two guys playing at a level that you don't see unless you have the concentration heightened to where it was at. We never backed off from one another. Birdie for birdie, shot for shot, we were going right at each other. That's as good as it gets.''</p>
        <p>Woods (66-67-70-67) and May (72-66-66-66) finished five strokes ahead of Thomas Bjorn (13 under par), who finished third. But on the back nine, the other contenders could not keep up with the torrid pace set by Woods and May at Valhalla Golf Club, a course that has been criticized for lacking history and major championship difficulty.</p>
        <p>Both players shot a sizzling five-under-par 31 on the back nine. May began the run with birdies at No. 10, No. 11 and No. 12, and he led for most of the day. This was a player who did not come to praise Woods. Only Woods's greatest prevented May from glory.</p>
        <p>''I think I proved to a lot of people that I could play under the heat,'' said May, who heard plenty of support from the noisy gallery following the final group. ''I think people started rooting for me about the second hole, when I made birdie, and Tiger made bogey. I think they figured, 'O.K., this is going to be a little bit interesting.' They probably thought Tiger was going to do what he usually does, run away.''</p>
        <p>But May would not go away, leading to 21 holes of riveting competition.</p>
        <p>There were many key moments, although several stood out. May almost won at No. 18 in regulation, when he made a sensational 15-foot birdie putt from the back fringe to take a momentary one-stroke lead, forcing Woods to make a 5-foot birdie putt to keep the tournament alive.</p>
        <p>''The way things were going, I had to figure he was going to make his putt,'' Woods said of May's putt. ''So I had to step up there and bury mine.''</p>
        <p>On the first hole of the playoff, Woods took a one-stroke lead for good at the par-4 No. 16, making a 15-foot putt for birdie, after May hit a great chip to save par. Then on the final hole, the par-5 No. 18, after Woods and May both pulled their drives left and failed to reach the green in two shots, Woods hit a tremendous bunker shot within a foot, leaving May with a tough 30-foot putt uphill for birdie that he needed to keep the match going. May's putt for birdie just missed, and Woods tapped in for victory, taking the first-place check of $900,000, and setting a single-season earning record of more than $6.6 million.</p>
        <p>Another key turning point came at No. 15 in regulation, when Woods made a 15-foot putt to save par, then May missed a 4-foot putt that would have given him a birdie. If Woods had missed his putt at No. 15, and May had sunk his, May would have had a three-stroke lead with three holes to play. Instead, Woods remained just one stroke back, and he pulled even at No. 17, hitting a huge drive, then hitting a beautiful sand wedge shot from 96 yards within 2 feet for birdie.</p>
        <p>''The one shot that meant the most to me was that putt at No. 15,'' Woods said. ''If I missed that putt, he makes his, he's three up with three to go. I'm not looking very good. To step up there and make a 15-footer for par, with everything on the line, that feels pretty good. That was a big putt.''</p>
        <p>But after winning another major, Woods's career continues to grow in stature. He has a chance to become the first player to win four consecutive professional majors at next year's Masters, but for tonight, that could wait. Woods wanted to savor a victory.</p>
        <p>''To play as well as I did down the stretch is very special,'' Woods said. ''It's hard to rank. This is probably the most exciting from a player's standpoint. On Sunday at a major championship, knowing the fact that par is not going to win, that is different. I made a lot of good putts coming in, especially the big ones I needed to make. I was able to pour them right in the hole. I hit a lot of good quality shots and so did Bob. It was a great day.''</p>
