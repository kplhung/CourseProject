        <p>A go-go dancer wiggles as the music starts to play on the video for the song ''Nicotine &amp; Gravy.'' The song's performer, Beck, appears briefly on screen, and then is soon replaced by a throbbing montage of photographs and glaring graphics.</p>
        <p>''Nicotine &amp; Gravy'' might look like just another hyperkinetic MTV offering. But like an increasing number of music videos, this one has a digital twist: it was produced specifically for the Internet, not  television. To suit its intended medium, the video's creators used software that crams its saturated colors and lively animation into a relatively compact file for fast downloading. The cost is compressed, too, with a budget far below that of a full-scale music video.</p>
        <p>Further evidence that this is a music digital, as the online videos are sometimes called, is found in the final frame of ''Nicotine &amp; Gravy,'' which is available on Shockwave.com. The frame provides a link to Beck's Web site, www.beck.com, where an e-commerce shop sells compact discs, T-shirts and mouse pads.</p>
        <p>So far, fewer than three dozen music digitals are available on the Web, from a half-dozen companies that include Fullerene Productions and Sudden Industries.  And such files are greatly outnumbered by MTV-style video clips available for viewing on many sites via so-called streaming technology, in which the clips remain on the host Web site, rather than being downloaded for playback on the user's computer. The drawback to the more common streamed video images, though, is that after being squeezed to pass through a phone line, the streamed images are tiny, blurred and washed out by the time they arrive on the computer screen. Even with high-speed DSL or cable-modem Internet connections, streaming video can look jerky.</p>
        <p>Proponents see a future in music digitals as a video counterpart to MP3 files -- the compressed files that are now the most popular format for sending digital music over the Internet. And in fact, the music-digital video files can be even smaller packets of data than MP3 files, though the audio portion of the music digital tends to be of somewhat lesser quality than with MP3.</p>
        <p>''If people will take the time to download an MP3, which is about three and a half megabytes for a three-and-a-half-minute song, they'll download a full-length music video that's a half or third that size,'' said Jeff Ellermeyer, president of Fullerene Productions, the Los Angeles company that made the Beck video.</p>
        <p>Beck's recording label, Seagram's Interscope, also benefits. ''The label gets another way to distribute the music, except that this one has marketing components built in,'' Mr. Ellermeyer said. One promise of future interactive, high-speed cable television systems is that people will be able to ''watch a video, click on a link and go buy the album,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Well,'' Mr. Ellermeyer added, ''we're doing that now.''</p>
        <p>Even MTV, the showcase for conventional videos, is experimenting with what it calls Webeos -- online videos that can be downloaded and that let viewers control some of the sounds and images. On Sept. 1, the company plans to post its first five interactive Webeos for songs by performers like Moby, Busta Rhymes and Bjork.</p>
        <p>For the ''I've Seen It All'' Webeo, Bjork is working with Floria Sigismondi, the noted video director, and even rerecording a shorter version of the tune. As the song plays, viewers will be able to click on portions of the screen to see Bjork's handwritten lyrics or alter the audio. For Busta Rhymes's ''Make Noise,'' Web users can select images they want to see during the video.</p>
        <p>''We've got a great platform for traditional music videos, which is our television services,'' said Nicholas Butterworth, president and chief executive of MTV's interactive group. ''For the Web, we're trying to come up with something that really uses the capabilities of the medium.''</p>
        <p>Since the debut of the MTV cable channel on Aug. 1, 1981, with a screening of the video for the Buggles' song ''Video Killed the Radio Star,'' music videos have become an integral part of the recording industry's marketing campaigns for new and established artists, while emerging as a staple of popular culture in their own right.</p>
        <p>Developers of the new forms of online videos hope to keep that tradition of marketing and art form alive. Although Beck's ''Nicotine &amp; Gravy'' is one of only 15 music digitals on Shockwave.com, Stefanie Henning, the site's vice president for content acquisition, said she hoped to have 100 ''Shockwave Singles'' online within a year -- as a lure to viewers and advertisers alike.</p>
        <p>No one expects the Internet to kill the conventional music video. For one thing, Web videos do not yet deliver the millions of eyeballs that television can bring. Fullerene's online video for the Duran Duran song ''Someone Else Not Me'' was an Internet hit, for example. But that meant it was downloaded a mere 15,000 times in June.</p>
        <p>And yet, the lower costs of the mostly animated music digitals mean they do not necessarily need to attract as large an audience as the television versions. Another company in the field, Sudden Industries, has charged $15,000 to $100,000 for the Vmations -- as the company calls them -- that it has created for Nine Inch Nails and a dozen other acts. That compares with the cost of a professionally made television music video, which starts at $100,000, with the cost of a big-budget production reaching into the millions.</p>
        <p>Sudden Industries' founder, Bob Holmes, who was nominated for a music-video Grammy Award as a member of the group Rubber Rodeo in 1982, says that online videos have their special niches in the music industry.</p>
        <p>''Today,'' he said, ''the artists who are best served by them are the ones that either have a loyal following on the Web, or the bands that can't afford to do full-scale music videos and want to find an alternative form of marketing.''</p>
        <p>At MTV, a unit of Viacom, Webeos are seen as a complement to the network's televised programming. The ones scheduled for September release are being produced to promote this year's Video Music Awards, and the company will introduce others in the coming months. ''Our audience is increasingly using two screens at once, crossing back and forth from TV to the Web,'' Mr. Butterworth said.</p>
        <p>It was Mark Ghuneim, senior vice president for online technologies at Sony's  Columbia Records Group, who is credited with coining the phrase music digitals a few years ago. He says he is pleased to see that ''now, there finally are some.''</p>
        <p>Three of Sony's music acts are working on Vmations: P. J. Olsson, performing ''Visine;'' Getaway People, doing the song ''Six Pac;'' and PaloAlto, with ''Sonny.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ghuneim said Vmations could be a good way for emerging artists to produce low-cost music videos that could be shown on the Internet as well as on television.</p>
        <p>Some made-for-PC videos are starting to pop up on television. Mr. Ellermeyer said that his Duran Duran video had been on MTV and that the Beck video had been on MTV2. And Cablevision's MuchMusic USA, a channel devoted to music videos, is preparing a fall pilot for a 30-minute show devoted to Sudden Industries' Vmations. Nora Ryan, MuchMusic's general manager, said the program is being developed  with an eye toward the day when interactive set-top boxes for televisions are widely available.</p>
        <p>But as the MTV generation becomes increasingly a Web audience, and as online technology improves, it may turn out that music videos on television will become less important. That possibility provides another motivation for MTV's Webeos. ''Over the next couple of years, who's to say that music video might not migrate more to the Internet?'' Mr. Butterworth said. ''We're just trying to jump-start something we think is going to happen over the long term anyway.''</p>
