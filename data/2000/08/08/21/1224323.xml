        <p>Of all the unusual aspects of what is shaping up to be one of the most important espionage cases of the post-cold-war era -- the trial here of Wen Ho Lee -- none is more striking than the fact that it is not an espionage trial at all.</p>
        <p>In a 59-count indictment, Dr. Lee, a former nuclear scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, is charged with having illegally downloaded a virtual library of nuclear weapons design and test data with the intent of harming the United States. It is a crime that carries a possible life sentence.</p>
        <p>But the government has specifically said it will not raise espionage at the trial and has acknowledged repeatedly that it has no evidence that Dr. Lee ever handed over nuclear secrets to anyone. Indeed, in their bill of particulars the prosecutors said that Dr. Lee had taken the data to enhance his job prospects at scientific institutes in countries like France, Australia and Singapore.</p>
        <p>But the distinction could easily have been forgotten this week as Dr. Lee struggled, for the third time since his arrest in December, to be released on bail from the kind of harsh prison regimen usually reserved for nefarious superagents. (The government reported that Dr. Lee, held in something close to solitary confinement in Santa Fe, has actually had his conditions imporved, since he is now unshackled during his recreation time, has greater access to publications and is given more fruit.)</p>
        <p>The hearing dragged on for three days in the Federal District Court here, nearly unheard of for a bail hearing but the same length as Dr. Lee's last effort. It was characterized by the government's claims that  Dr. Lee's crimes were unprecedented in the history of nuclear weapons spying; that he was the subject of  ''classic P.R.C. tradecraft,'' or Chinese spying techniques, in a mysterious encounter in Beijing 12 years ago; that he might have altered the global balance of military power; and that he had compromised the United States' efforts to build a ballistic missile defense system.</p>
        <p>George Stamboulidis, an assistant United States attorney drafted from Long Island to prosecute the case, said of Dr. Lee's actions, ''It's of a caliber where hundreds of millions of people could be killed.''</p>
        <p>The government clearly resorted to such assertions to justify keeping Dr. Lee in prison until his trial, scheduled to begin in November. But in doing so the prosecution transformed the courtroom into a forum for some of the nation's most eminent nuclear weapons experts to debate issues like what is really secret now in the nuclear world, how useful nuclear designs are to countries that do not possess a sophisticated industrial infrastructure, and the value of computer simulations of nuclear explosions in an era when most countries have sworn off testing.</p>
        <p>But the most significant result of the government tactic of characterizing this as an egregious case of espionage may have been to make the holes the defense punched in the prosecution's case appear that much more glaring.</p>
        <p>In one of the most damaging disclosures, an F.B.I. agent conceded that the government had no evidence that the letters Dr. Lee wrote to the foreign institutes seeking employment, found in a search of his home, were ever mailed.</p>
        <p>And the agent, Robert Messemer, acknowledged that he had incorrectly described Dr. Lee as having resorted to rank deception when he borrowed a colleague's computer to download the vast trove of weapons secrets to portable computer tapes.</p>
        <p>In an exchange in December that Judge James A. Parker cited in denying Dr. Lee bail then, Mr. Messemer said that Dr. Lee had told his colleague that he only wanted to download a resume, when in fact the colleague had made no such claim.</p>
        <p>But this damaging about-face on claims delivered with confidence at the last bail hearing provided more evidence that two almost separate exercises are under way in Dr. Lee's case -- one highly personal, the other a policy debate on the nature of nuclear proliferation and nuclear security in the new millennium.</p>
        <p>This split was seemingly buttressed by the judge's surprising public plea at the end of the hearing to have the lawyers from each side help him sort out the long and odd list of issues he must resolve before deciding whether he will release Dr. Lee. Some issues relate specifically to Dr. Lee's credibility, and others to the hypothetical question of whether Dr. Lee might still be able to transfer some of the secret data to a hostile country, and if so, if that would threaten the United States.</p>
        <p>There is no longer any question whether Dr. Lee did anything wrong -- his lawyers all but conceded that he had violated at least some rules on the handling of classified information -- but the issue is whether what he is accused of is a crime worthy of a life sentence, or an act of recklessness that could be dealt with in a less harsh fashion.</p>
        <p>''He may have been arrogant and he just may have made a stupid mistake,'' Mark Holscher, one of Dr. Lee's lawyers, said in his summation on Friday, indicating that Dr. Lee may have no defense for the way in which he downloaded and then handled the data, given that 7 of the 10 tapes he made are unaccounted for.</p>
        <p>The government says that Dr. Lee dedicated a great deal of time -- more than 40 hours -- to assembling the secret files, moving them to an unsecure computer and then downloading them, but in doing so he left a lengthy, clumsy paper trail, which he took almost no steps to cover up. He was even detected during the process, but the security officer who had monitored the transfer by computer dropped the matter.</p>
        <p>Another issue on trial seems to be whether a huge volume of data on nuclear tests and bomb features, the information Dr. Lee downloaded, is as important as simple blueprints for constructing bombs, the sort of prize that might have been sought in traditional spycraft.</p>
        <p>At the least, all the testimony and legal jousting left Judge Parker with no easier decision than he had last time, when he agreed with the government to detain Dr. Lee. Late Friday, Judge Parker laboriously went through some 20 points of concern that he had cited in his earlier decision, and questioned how many of them could be seen in a different light based on the evidence introduced this week.</p>
        <p>He hinted that, at least to some degree, he saw Dr. Lee as less devious now, but he gave no indication of when he would make his ruling. He also expressed concern about the prospect of the missing tapes ending up in hostile hands, and how the arcane data might affect global nuclear policy, a weighty issue for a trial that supposedly does not concern espionage.</p>
