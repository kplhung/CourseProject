        <p>In this city that lives off the sea, people know about disaster. But even here, the tragedy of the sunken submarine Kursk, which entombed 118 sailors, has rattled residents and brought a hush to the streets.</p>
        <p>In a corner of the city where most of the navy staff members live, residents said they noticed an unusual stillness after officials said on Saturday -- for the first time since the accident on Aug. 12 -- that most of the crew on the nuclear powered submarine probably had died instantly.</p>
        <p>The neighborhood, called Rosta, borders the bay. It is home not only to many navy people but also to a navy museum and a submarine repair factory. Tall grass and purple flowers fringe crumbling cement apartment buildings here. Only a few people were strolling this afternoon, though the air in this northern city had warmed since morning.</p>
        <p>''It's so quiet today,'' said Sveta, a 29-year-old mother of two, wheeling her youngest in a baby carriage. ''We keep thinking about them, the sailors. The military -- that is the worst profession. It is bad money and dangerous.''</p>
        <p>She has lived all her life in Murmansk. Her husband works on a fishing boat that sails mostly in foreign seas, giving the family access to much-sought-after foreign currency. She said that her husband managed to avoid military service, compulsory in Russia, after he graduated from college six years ago. Their 10-month-old son, Dmitri, will follow his father's example when he grows up, if she has anything to say about it.</p>
        <p>The navy has had its share of disasters involving vessels from this fleet. Another nuclear-powered submarine, the Komsomolets, sank off the coast of Norway in 1989, killing 42 members of the crew after a fire on board raged out of control.</p>
        <p>Nine years later, federal agents stormed a nuclear-powered submarine and shot a 19-year-old sailor who had killed eight crew members.</p>
        <p>Many have left this region since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, mostly to chase higher wages and better job opportunities farther south. The Murmansk region, which encompasses all of the Kola Peninsula and is home to 983,000 people, has lost about 15 percent of its population since 1991.</p>
        <p>In 1997, the region had one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. According to the state statistics committee, the average sailor brings home about $85 a month.</p>
        <p>The day after the Kursk sailors were declared dead, residents continued to click on radios and televisions every hour for the news as the rescue effort dragged on. But today, as they watched and listened, they seemed numbly resigned to the outcome.</p>
        <p>Two women behind the counter at the Youth Cafe in central Murmansk took a break from placing chickens on a roaster to turn on a radio for news. People in line behind the counter leaned closer to listen. Few took solace in the fact that foreign rescue crews began work today. The hospital boat meant for ailing crew members left for the small town of Vidyayevo, where the sailors' families are staying. It will instead treat anguished relatives.</p>
        <p>Some residents said that the mysterious submarine disaster clearly shows that lives mean little here and that the government in the Kremlin has lost touch with people.</p>
        <p>''This is a shame, a shame before the whole world,'' said Andrei Lebedev, a 37-year-old engineer who works on a fishing trawler.</p>
