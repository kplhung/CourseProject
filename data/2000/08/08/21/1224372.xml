        <p>Shannon Miller went twisting into the air during her first vault tonight but found herself too low in the air and too short on her landing. With a horrendous thud, her legs jammed into the padding like post-hole diggers.</p>
        <p>Her 23-year-old body buckled on impact. Suddenly, Miller, the most decorated female gymnast in American history, was flat on her back at the Olympic trials, staring at the rafters of the Fleet Center as her coach, Steve Nunno, and Bela Karolyi circled her. They spoke, but their words did not register. In her daze, Miller was more stunned than injured, more mortified than hurt. With stiff legs, Miller got up and finished her only event of the night with an awkward second vault.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, a distraught Miller scratched from the competition. The doctors cleared her, but it was obvious Miller could not put on a show that would reflect her golden image. Still, she was looking for a miracle appointment to the Olympic team, hoping Karolyi's belief in her had not eroded, believing her body of work might be enough.</p>
        <p>Although there was room in the selection committee's subjective rules to put her on the six-woman team, Karolyi and company chose the two other remaining members of the 1996 Olympic gold-medal team. Those two, Amy Chow and Dominique Dawes, were going to Sydney, Australia -- alongside the new generation gymnasts Elise Ray, Kristen Maloney, Morgan White and Jamie Dantzscher -- but Miller was left off.</p>
        <p>Miller wiped the tears from her face and exited the building, knowing her career was over.</p>
        <p>''In two back-to-back performances, on Friday and tonight,'' Karolyi said, ''Shannon could not prove she was capable of representing her country.''</p>
        <p>It was a brutal punctuation to a wonderful career. But in a way, the end to her comeback simplified the selection process, in which only the top four performers based on the trials and the national championships were guaranteed spots on the team. The top four were Ray, Chow, Maloney and White.</p>
        <p>If Miller had completed the trials with a solid but not spectacular performance, if she had finished out of the top six or even top 10 at the trials, controversy would have erupted had she made the team. As it was, Miller's presence caused an undercurrent of tension.</p>
        <p>''I guess if someone says they deserve to be on the team like she did -- at least that's what I read, I wasn't in her interviews -- then I guess people assume she'll be on it,'' said Dawes, who began her comeback in April and placed seventh in the overall competition. ''I don't think I deserved to be on the team. I came here and wanted to prove I belonged. Just because you made it in '92 and in '96, that doesn't give you the right to think you belong in 2000.''</p>
        <p>The committee agreed. They could not rationalize placing Miller on the team and leaving off someone like Dawes, who leapfrogged the sixth-place Vanessa Atler to land on the team. Atler's omission from the team -- with the eighth-place Alyssa Beckerman named as the alternate -- was the only real stunner of the night. What was more perplexing was Atler's reaction to it.</p>
        <p>Although she was fourth at the nationals and was considered a shoo-in to make the team, Atler was mentally unprepared to perform at her best tonight. And she knew it. For some reason, her heart was not in this meet and it showed with scores that left her 10th in the trials. She failed to score better than a 9.437 on any apparatus.</p>
        <p>''I think everyone else wanted it for me more than I did,'' Atler said. ''When they named the team, it was sort of a relief. I knew I wasn't ready. I was messing up all over the place. It's not my time.</p>
        <p>''I just didn't have any fun here. I don't know, I just wasn't into it. The performance I put out there is not Olympic material. Maybe that's why I'm not as upset about this as I could be. That's why I'm not taking this too hard.''</p>
        <p>Atler was even smiling. There were tears everywhere -- some for joy and some out of disappointment -- but there was very little controversy. Except for Atler, the team was selected in order. Although Ray was first in the overall competition, the two most spectacular performances tonight belonged to the veteran Chow and White, a waif-like blond wonder. Chow, a pre-med student, brought out a roar from the crowd with her 9.725 on the uneven bars. Then White wowed everyone as she moved through her floor exercise with lightness and ease to score a 9.650.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing; I'm just so excited to be on this team,'' the 17-year-old White said. ''I didn't know what was going to happen. I just knew there was no room for error and went for every routine.''</p>
        <p>After so much consternation over the selection procedure, there was barely a ripple of discontent. Even Miller must have known her chances were slim. After she scratched from the meet, she had hope, but the redness in her eyes revealed her doubts.</p>
        <p>''They've seen what I can do,'' said Miller, who felt stiffness in her legs but admitted she was not injured. ''They saw what I did in verification on Tuesday and then on Friday. If they need me to be ready for the team, I'll be ready. Obviously, I wanted to compete tonight, but I didn't want to risk an injury. I didn't want to go out there not looking my best.''</p>
        <p>The last image of Miller at the Olympics will have to sustain her. Although Karolyi was one of her biggest supporters during a comeback that began in December, he chose the six women he believes can defend the gold the 1996 team took home: two of the Magnificent Seven, Chow and Dawes, with four newcomers by their side in Sydney.</p>
        <p>''I think this was the most colorful and dramatic trials ever,'' Karolyi said. ''I didn't know how it was going to turn out. I believe I was right with this process.</p>
        <p>''I believe we are medal contenders. This is a strong team. If they perform to their potential, they can win a medal.''</p>
