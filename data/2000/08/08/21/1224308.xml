        <p>''Legal Firms Cutting Back on Free Services for Poor'' (front page, Aug. 17) should be disturbing to those whose sense of injustice is aroused by our underprivileged population's being denied access to the legal system.</p>
        <p>There is a solution. Congress should restore the financing cuts made in 1996 to the Legal Services Corporation and remove the restrictions on legal services providers. Second, states should provide permanent financing for legal services.</p>

        <p>''Legal Firms Cutting Back on Free Services for Poor'' (front page, Aug. 17) should be disturbing to those whose sense of injustice is aroused by our underprivileged population's being denied access to the legal system.</p>
        <p>There is a solution. Congress should restore the financing cuts made in 1996 to the Legal Services Corporation and remove the restrictions on legal services providers. Second, states should provide permanent financing for legal services.</p>
        <p>And at a time when there is competition among law firms to recruit the top graduates of the elite schools, these graduates should make it clear that they will not work for firms that do not permit them to work a significant number of pro bono hours, and that these hours must be credited toward the hourly goal set by the firm for associates.</p>
