        <p>Months ago, The Financial Times gave the producers of ''Bull,'' TNT's new series about Wall Street, permission to use its image in the program.</p>
        <p>John Lizars, the newspaper's vice president for marketing, described it as ''the standard permission that we and all people engage in product placement: that the product may be used in a setting appropriate to the product and in no way denigrates the product.''</p>

        <p>Months ago, The Financial Times gave the producers of ''Bull,'' TNT's new series about Wall Street, permission to use its image in the program.</p>
        <p>John Lizars, the newspaper's vice president for marketing, described it as ''the standard permission that we and all people engage in product placement: that the product may be used in a setting appropriate to the product and in no way denigrates the product.''</p>
        <p>''In 99 times out of 100, that works out quite nicely,'' he said.</p>
        <p>This was one time it did not.</p>
        <p>About two weeks before the program made its debut last Tuesday, Mr. Lizars said, executives at the newspaper were startled to read in news reports that one character in the premier episode was a Financial Times reporter who behaves unethically.</p>
        <p>In return for a scoop, the reporter character, Johnny Walker, agrees to disperse misleading investment information to one of his source's business associates to trick the man into making a high-stakes deal.</p>
        <p>That is not the sort of behavior the newspaper condones, Mr. Lizars said. ''We had no idea that they were going to interject a character in the program purported to be an F.T. reporter,'' he said. ''I can assure you, we took the attitude that this person denigrated the image of our journalists.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lizars said the newspaper immediately made its displeasure known to executives at Warner Brothers, which produces the program. The newspaper's lawyers followed up. In response, executives at Warner Brother's ''were quite accommodating,'' Mr. Lizars said.</p>
        <p>So, at the end of the program, the studio added the following disclaimer: ''The character portrayed as a Financial Times reporter is fictitious and does not imply that Financial Times journalists have ever engaged in improprieties. The Financial Times is a world-renowned newspaper and is respected for its quality and integrity.''</p>
        <p>The glowing disclaimer has gone over well at The Financial Times, which is owned by Pearson P.L.C.</p>
        <p>''Our agreement was very quick and very amicable,'' Mr. Lizars said. ''This was a misunderstanding that was very quickly resolved.''</p>
        <p>Warner Brothers and TNT had no official comment. Executives familiar with the story said they were under the impression that the newspaper had received a copy of the script much earlier and had raised no objections.</p>
        <p>Asked if he expected the Financial Times character to show up again in a later episode of the program, Mr. Lizars said, ''I don't think that would be in their interest or ours.''</p>
