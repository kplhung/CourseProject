        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>President Clinton, in his valedictory address to the Democratic National Convention (editorial, Aug. 15), asked, ''Are you better off than you were eight years ago?'', to which his audience responded with a resounding, ''Yes.'' That is true, financially, for most Americans. But for Mr. Clinton to take credit for this is specious. The reversal in our national budgetary situation was fueled by a huge increase in tax receipts brought about by the technology revolution, not by spending cuts.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>President Clinton, in his valedictory address to the Democratic National Convention (editorial, Aug. 15), asked, ''Are you better off than you were eight years ago?'', to which his audience responded with a resounding, ''Yes.'' That is true, financially, for most Americans. But for Mr. Clinton to take credit for this is specious. The reversal in our national budgetary situation was fueled by a huge increase in tax receipts brought about by the technology revolution, not by spending cuts.</p>
        <p>But for the state of our ethics and morals -- that is, our spiritual state -- we are undoubtedly worse off, and for this Mr. Clinton must bear a large measure of responsibility. His ''outsized personal problems,'' as you label them, have made parenting more difficult, and his brilliant linguistic dancing has created an aura in which truth has taken on an aspect more of relativism than of certainty.</p>
