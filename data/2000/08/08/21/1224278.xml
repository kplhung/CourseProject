        <p>On Earth and Heaven  The millennium takes the spotlight at Harvard's Fogg Museum in Cambridge, Mass., beginning on Saturday. Not the new millennium but the one a thousand years ago, when many people anticipated that the world would end, and the City of God, the Heavenly Jerusalem described in Scripture, would come on earth. In a collaboration with the university's Graduate School of Design, an exhibition at the Fogg will contrast the Romanesque architecture of Western Europe at that time with artistic visions of the City of God inspired by the biblical account of the Apocalypse. Among the 60 works on display through Jan. 21 in ''Before and After the End of Time: Architecture and the Year 1000,'' is an installation representing the Heavenly Jerusalem, made of gemstone and designed especially for the exhibition. Information: (617) 495-9400.</p>
        <p>Talent Search  You tell your best friend you would do anything for him. What happens when he asks you to kill someone? This compelling idea has been turned into a play by Jeremy Martinez of DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. ''Do Me a Favor,'' and seven others by New York City high school students are to be presented at 7 p.m. from tomorrow through Sunday in professional productions in the ninth annual ''Summer Play Party'' at the MCC Theater, 120 West 28th Street, Manhattan. The event is intended to inspire the students to pursue dramatic writing, and the 8 plays were chosen from some 60 by students citywide. With the authors involved in production from rehearsal to presentation, four plays, including ''Do Me a Favor,'' will be performed tomorrow, Thursday and Saturday evenings, and the rest on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. Tickets are free, although a $5 donation and reservations are suggested. Information: (212) 727-7765.</p>
