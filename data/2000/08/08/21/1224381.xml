        <p>A team of Norwegian divers managed to open the damaged outer hatch of the sunken Russian submarine Kursk early today and found the escape chamber was flooded but found no sign that any of the crew members were alive.</p>
        <p>First reports from the rescue site in the Barents Sea indicated that officials had not yet decided how to open the inner hatch below that provides access to the submarine.</p>
        <p>Having found no signs of life aboard the Russian submarine Kursk more than a week after it plunged to the bottom of the Barents Sea, rescue teams had been preparing a plan to use a ship's crane to rip a hatch off the vessel and begin the grim task of recovering bodies and a lengthy and dangerous mission to salvage the submarine's twin nuclear reactors.</p>
        <p>In their first full day of work on Sunday, a team of Norwegian divers working with the Russians found the rear escape hatch on the 490-foot vessel badly damaged, a Russian official said, and they failed in repeated attempts to force it open by hand and with powerful special tools.</p>
        <p>The divers reported that hatchway valves had been opened from the inside, leading Russian officials to conclude that the body of one of the submarine's 118 crew members was in the flooded air lock chamber.</p>
        <p>During the weekend, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya I. Klebanov and  Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak, chief of staff of Russia's Northern Fleet, indicated that one or more members of the Kursk crew may have tried to make a desperate escape from the submarine, only to perish when seawater under great pressure rushed in.</p>
        <p>In a frenetic day working at a depth of more than 300 feet, the Norwegian Navy team on Sunday sent back vivid pictures of the escape hatch that had defied nearly a week of efforts to open it. The divers pounded with hammers on the hull, hoping that their soundings would locate any remaining air pockets inside.</p>
        <p>As they worked in teams of three in six-hour shifts, the divers sent up requests for special tools to turn the hatch valves and some tools were fabricated on board the Norwegian vessel.</p>
        <p>On Sunday night, two Norwegian divers flew by helicopter to the Russian submarine base at Vidyayevo, Kursk's home port, to practice opening and entering hatches on one of the Kursk's sister ships before returning to the Kursk, where planning was under way to rip the hatch cover off by force, according to Mr. Klebanov.</p>
        <p>''The joint commission made a decision to open the top hatch of the rescue lock chamber,'' he said, referring to the escape chamber that passes through the hull with inner and outer hatches that allow emergency exit from the submarine. ''Unfortunately, they failed to open it for several hours, though very powerful tools have been used.''</p>
        <p>They succeeded today where they failed yesterday.</p>
        <p>Russian officials reported that air pockets might still exist in the compartment below the inner hatch, but they expressed no expectations that  any survivors would be found, though a Norwegian military spokesman in Oslo, Kjell Grandhagen, said, ''We are still working on the theory that we are looking for possible survivors.''</p>
        <p>What seemed a cooperative spirit in the joint effort of Russian, British and Norwegian rescue crews was somewhat undermined Sunday night when the spokesman for the Norwegian armed forces, speaking in Oslo, contradicted Mr. Klebanov's statements that the escape hatch was too severely damaged to be opened manually or with the British LR5 rescue submarine that arrived on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''We have not drawn the conclusion that the hatch is so damaged that it cannot be opened,'' the spokesman, John Epsen Lien, told Reuters. ''We think it should be possible to open it with a British or Russian rescue capsule.''</p>
        <p>The British minisubmarine began diving toward the Kursk at about 7 a.m. today.</p>
        <p>Earlier Mr. Klebanov said that video images of the hatch showed a serious crack in the ring around it that creates an airtight seal.</p>
        <p>''That is why we think the British sub will not be able to dock,'' Mr. Klebanov said, adding that he believed that the Norwegian divers would agree to enter the Kursk after studying the entryway on one of Kursk's sister ships.</p>
        <p>''Their commander is now asking them who will go and it is already clear that someone will go,'' Mr. Klebanov said. ''Psychologically, it is very difficult but there is assuredness that several people will agree and the operation will continue.''</p>
        <p>Norwegian officials have yet to confirm that their divers will enter the Kursk.</p>
        <p>What lies ahead after the hatch is opened is a complex and dangerous investigation of the Kursk's nine compartments. Dangerous battery acids, unexploded weapons and highly radioactive fuel elements in the Kursk's twin reactors could pose a serious danger to the recovery operation.</p>
        <p>Russian officials have speculated about lifting the rear section of the submarine partly and then dragging  the vessel with surface ships to shallower waters for easier access by salvage divers. With winter already approaching in the Arctic region, it seemed possible that the salvage operation could carry over to next spring, but Russian officials have as yet given no accounting of their plans.</p>
        <p>As the Norwegian divers worked on Sunday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met in Moscow with senior clergymen of the Russian Orthodox Church and expressed the powerlessness he felt over the loss of the 118-member crew of the attack submarine, which went down on Aug. 12 during military maneuvers.</p>
        <p>''With sorrow in our hearts and, I do not exaggerate, tears in our eyes, we are following all that is happening in the Barents Sea,'' he said. ''The sailors are doing everything they can to save their comrades, but, alas, sometimes events -- and not us -- dictate the logic of how a situation develops.''</p>
        <p>Still, he added, ''until the last minute we will do all that can be done to save whoever can be saved. We will struggle for the lives of each of our sailors, and hope for the best.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's remarks, delivered in an unusually somber and deliberate tone standing in front of the golden brocade walls of one of the churches inside the Kremlin walls, appeared in part to be in response to a swell of criticism that the Russian military, and Mr. Putin personally, were too slow to seek foreign help in the Kursk rescue operation. Two explosions apparently ripped through the hull of the 490-foot submarine as it was running at periscope depth and sent it crashing to the seabed.</p>
        <p>The investigating commission announced on Saturday that preliminary findings showed that the Kursk was involved in a collision with an object near the surface weighing 8,000 tons or more. Mr. Klebanov  said it was possible that such an object could have been a ship or an old mine. Or, he said, some unknown chain of events could have set off an  explosion aboard the submarine.</p>
        <p>In any case, Russian officials say most of crew died in the first two minutes after the explosion, including all officers on the bridge. As many as six of the submarine's nine sections were flooded, and the others slowly filled with seawater.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the pressure of the intruding seawater compressed the air in the hull and reduced the chances for survival beyond a few days.</p>
