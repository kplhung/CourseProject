        <p>Survey by Pew Research Center for People and the Press finds that consumers are concerned about their privacy but that many of them are willing to share personal information with Web sites they use; many Internet users surveyed do not understand how their online activities are observed and do not take advantage of tools to protect themselves; graph (M)</p>

        <p>In the continuing battle between Internet companies that want to use customers' personal information to deliver tailored advertisements and services and privacy advocates who want stricter controls over how this information is used, consumers themselves appear to be of two minds.</p>
        <p>At least that is the finding of a survey whose results were released last night by the Pew Research Center for People and the Press, a nonprofit group. While many consumers surveyed expressed concern about their privacy, many also said they were willing to share personal information with the Web sites they used. And many Internet users in the survey sample indicated they did not understand how their online activities were observed and did not take advantage of tools to protect themselves.</p>

        <p>In the continuing battle between Internet companies that want to use customers' personal information to deliver tailored advertisements and services and privacy advocates who want stricter controls over how this information is used, consumers themselves appear to be of two minds.</p>
        <p>At least that is the finding of a survey whose results were released last night by the Pew Research Center for People and the Press, a nonprofit group. While many consumers surveyed expressed concern about their privacy, many also said they were willing to share personal information with the Web sites they used. And many Internet users in the survey sample indicated they did not understand how their online activities were observed and did not take advantage of tools to protect themselves.</p>
        <p>The report, which surveyed 2,117 Americans, 1,017 of whom were Internet users, found that 86 percent of the Internet users favored ''opt in'' privacy policies, which require Internet companies to obtain people's permission before using their personal data. This preference is in contrast to the policy recently negotiated by the Clinton administration, the Federal Trade Commission and a group of Internet advertisers, which gives Web sites the right to track visitors unless those users ''opt out'' of being monitored.</p>
        <p>On a similar note, 54 percent of Internet users in the survey said that the tracking of users by a Web site was harmful because it invaded their privacy, compared with 27 percent who described it as helpful because it allowed sites to tailor information to specific consumers.</p>
        <p>And 94 percent of the Internet users agreed that any company that violated its privacy policy should be disciplined -- with 11 percent of the disciplinarians saying the company's owners should be sent to prison.</p>
        <p>Despite this hard line, the Pew survey revealed a deep pocket of trust among Internet users. Slightly more than half said they had provided personal information to a Web site and an additional 10 percent said they would provide it under the right circumstances. Only 27 percent said they would never provide a Web site with personal information. Just less than half -- 48 percent -- said they had bought something online with a credit card and 22 said that had posted personal information on online calendars or online address books.</p>
        <p>As for efforts to protect their privacy, the survey indicated that many Internet users were either unaware of how they were being monitored online or unlikely to take steps to prevent being tracked. The report noted that 56 percent of Internet users could not identify the primary online tracking tool -- a ''cookie'' file placed on a user's computer by a Web site -- and only 10 percent of the Internet users had set their browser software to reject cookies.</p>
