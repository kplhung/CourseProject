        <p>Op-Ed article by Moira Johnston on recent recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires, accompanied by months of growing complaints, lawsuits and federal investigation, recalls similar scenario in huge Firestone recall of 1978; sees same corporate culture of greed and expediency, same blame-the-consumer attitude, and same willingness to let cascading reports of dangerous problems pile up in both cases; says these product failures must not go unpunished, unfixed or unremembered (M)</p>

        <p>Will we never learn? As the Firestone tire recall gives rise to a national storm of fear and blame, I fall into a funk of deja vu. I've been here before, terrified by defective products, seeing evidence of corporate callousness, and hearing the inevitable righteous cries for change.</p>
        <p>In 1977, I stood huddled with three terrified children and another mother on the shoulder of Interstate 5 in California's Central Valley, all of us shaking as we stared at a 16-inch tear in the wall of the Firestone tire that had blown out, almost killing us. I felt shock and rage as I learned, at the gas station we limped to, that this tire was notorious for failing. I found later that the accidents were often precisely like ours: a blowout in the rear left tire of a Ford station wagon.</p>

        <p>Will we never learn? As the Firestone tire recall gives rise to a national storm of fear and blame, I fall into a funk of deja vu. I've been here before, terrified by defective products, seeing evidence of corporate callousness, and hearing the inevitable righteous cries for change.</p>
        <p>In 1977, I stood huddled with three terrified children and another mother on the shoulder of Interstate 5 in California's Central Valley, all of us shaking as we stared at a 16-inch tear in the wall of the Firestone tire that had blown out, almost killing us. I felt shock and rage as I learned, at the gas station we limped to, that this tire was notorious for failing. I found later that the accidents were often precisely like ours: a blowout in the rear left tire of a Ford station wagon.</p>
        <p>Galvanized by a mother's fury, I wrote a magazine article on the Firestone 500 tire that spurred, in 1978, congressional hearings and the largest tire recall in American history. Firestone, nearly bankrupt, was saved with a buyout by the Japanese tiremaker Bridgestone.</p>
        <p>Reading about the current case -- Firestone's recall of 6.5 million tires on Aug. 9, six months of growing complaints and lawsuits, and a federal investigation -- makes me remember the lessons of 1978. The Firestone 500 case taught me that too often it takes needless deaths to rouse us to anger and make us demand reform.</p>
        <p>It takes images like the tangled wreck of a Texas couple's Ford Explorer in 1997 to force the class actions, federal investigations and congressional hearings that lead to the recalls and repairs -- of regulations, as well as of manufacturing practices.</p>
        <p>But unless the lessons penetrate deeply into a corporation's memory and conscience -- its DNA -- human frailty and expediency will likely prevail again. Now, there are complaints that 62 deaths are linked to failures of Firestone tires on Ford Explorers, and this has again turned a simmering problem into a scandal.</p>
        <p>Behind the 41 deaths attributed to the Firestone 500 by government investigators were 14,000 complaints from disgruntled tire owners, their trunks full of failed, ripped, blown 500's -- like me, alive by luck. Now, as in that scandal, drivers have complained, and dangers were known but not acted on quickly enough.</p>
        <p>The 500 was the product of a hidebound industry adapting antiquated equipment and mindsets to try to catch the wave of steel-belted radials sweeping in from Italy's technologically superior Michelin. Firestone has had 22 years to improve the manufacture of steel-belted tires, and today's parallels alarm me.</p>
        <p>I see the same corporate smokescreen, made even more dense by the symbiotic involvement of two companies. Proof does not come to light because confidentiality is often the condition of the settlements that grieving families choose over the prolonged pain of a trial, though it is in the courtroom that evidence can be exposed and the finger of guilt pointed publicly by a jury.</p>
        <p>I also see the same old tire-industry culture that perpetuates low technology, the same blame-the-consumer attitude, the same penny-pinching prorated tire replacement policies. And, above all, the same willingness to let cascading reports of dangerous problems pile up. Even as Ford was replacing the suspect tires on its Explorers in overseas markets last year, the problems were kept from the American public.</p>
        <p>As Ford tries to focus the heat on Firestone, as Firestone argues that Ford and its customers trade safety for the smoother ride of underinflated tires, the basic issue must not be obscured: Firestone tires are failing. The results, given the tendency of sport utility vehicles, like the Ford Explorer, to roll over in highway blowouts, are even more lethal than those from the Firestone 500.</p>
        <p>As the machines in our lives fail more rarely, consumers have shifted their vigilance and cries of concern to issues of communal well-being like the health of watersheds and salmon stocks. But there are still failures in products, too, and they must not go unpunished, unfixed or unremembered.</p>
