        <p>ZICKLIN-Robert. Died on August 20, 2000. Beloved husband of Carole. Devoted father of Adrienne and Diana. Grandfather of Benjamin. Cherished brother of Stanley and Gilbert. Closest of cousins to Larry and Rita, and loyal friend to many. A consummate New Yorker, he lived his life as a gift. We will miss him deeply. Service Tuesday, 11:45 AM, at ''The Riverside,'' 76th St and Amsterdam Ave. Donations may be made to the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>ZICKLIN-Robert. We mourn the loss of our dear friend and extend our loving wishes to his family. ''Zick'' was the dearest friend one could ever have; a man of integrity, limitless affection and a great sense of humor. We have all been lucky to have shared life with him. Leslie, Linda, Adam, Alana Libow</p>
        <p>ZICKLIN-Robert. Bob gave wisdom and joy to all who shared his life. He was the very best. Pat and Stuart Laurence</p>
