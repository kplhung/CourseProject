        <p>The minaret on the mosque was the last trace of the ancient village to disappear. Years after the homes and shops vanished, God's house stood as a mute witness before it, too, slipped beneath the waters of the Euphrates rising above the Ataturk Dam.</p>
        <p>Up and down the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers in southeastern Turkey, villages inhabited since the beginning of civilization are being flooded into watery oblivion by a vast dam system. For tens of thousands of people, those who live in places of great archaeological value and those in historically insignificant hamlets like Samsat, a way of life is being erased.</p>
        <p>The destruction is the price of progress. The Turkish government is in the final years of its largest public works project, an ambitious effort to quench an insatiable appetite for electricity, irrigate arid land and bring jobs to this impoverished region.</p>
        <p>The question being asked in Turkey, and with rising urgency by archaeologists and human rights groups worldwide, is whether the price is too high. And, as so often when modernization clashes with cultural heritage, the answer depends on whom you ask.</p>
        <p>For the planners, engineers and government officials involved in the $32 billion Southeastern Anatolia Project, the answer is a steadfast no. They describe the network of 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric plants as the key to the economic revitalization of Upper Mesopotamia and a vital component in satisfying the whole country's pressing need for electricity.</p>
        <p>''This was the least developed region of Turkey,'' said Olcay Unver, chairman of the project. ''Over the last 10 years its development rate has caught up with and surpassed the rest of Turkey.''</p>
        <p>When completed in a decade, the project will irrigate 2,500 square miles of land and affect the lives of 6.2 million people in the region. Government planners hope to build an export-based economy to ship agricultural products and finished goods worldwide.</p>
        <p>The plans also have political ramifications in this Kurdish region. After 15 years of conflict and at least 30,000 casualties, the army defeated the guerrilla group known as the Kurdistan Workers Party last year.</p>
        <p>Experts inside and outside government see the project as an opportunity to win the peace, though Kurdish grievances extend beyond poverty to issues of ethnic identity and equality, and those cannot be solved by providing electricity and jobs.</p>
        <p>The politics, like the rivers, do not end at the border. Syria and Iraq have depended on the Euphrates and Tigris for millenniums, and both have complained in recent years that Turkey is withholding their share of the water. Negotiations are stalled, and now the dams threaten to reduce the supply downstream.</p>
        <p>Statistics and politics mean little to Fatma Seker, 18. Her evaluation of the project is made at the personal level, by the money she earns in a clean, well-lighted factory, sewing T-shirts for export to Wal-Mart and Bugle Boy. She makes the minimum wage, about $138 a month, but the money goes a long way and she is proud of her first job.</p>
        <p>''We like our work, and life goes smoothly,'' she said shyly from beneath a traditional Muslim scarf during her lunch break at the Harrani Textile Company in Sanliurfa.</p>
        <p>Sanliurfa is a bustling, dusty city of 500,000 about 40 miles from Syria. Its best claim to fame is as the place where, according to Muslim tradition, Abraham was born and Job waited for divine mercy. It is also the laboratory for the way the government hopes to develop the region.</p>
        <p>Per capita income doubled in the last five years as water from the gigantic Ataturk Dam irrigated 500,000 acres on the nearby Harran Plain, increasing the production of cotton, wheat and vegetables.</p>
        <p>Helped by a five-year tax exemption and other incentives, cotton mills, garment factories and other businesses are operating in the city's industrial zone and officials are trying desperately to attract foreign investment.</p>
        <p>The start is small but promising. For instance, at the Polteks Company, 110 workers use the latest Swiss and German machinery to spin cotton from the Harran Plain into yarn for export to Italy. At Harrani Textile, 460 people, mostly conservative Muslim women in headscarves, turn out 180,000 T-shirts a month for the American market. Neither factory existed before the project.</p>
        <p>A two-hour drive northeast, upriver from the Ataturk Dam, the 4,600 villagers of Samsat have seen nothing of the prosperity blooming on the plain.</p>
        <p>Samsat was an important stronghold in the Byzantine era, controlling a strategic point on the Euphrates. Arabs conquered the region in A.D. 640, and the Turks came later.</p>
        <p>From medieval times on, Samsat was of little significance except to the people who lived there. The occasional tourist wandered in for a quick look at the ruins of a small fortress, but life remained quiet and slow.</p>
        <p>For years there were rumors about a dam. In April 1988, the authorities arrived from Ankara and told the residents they would be moved out. They would be paid the value of their modest houses and given new homes in a new Samsat, about a mile away, beyond the reach of the 500-square-mile lake that would rise behind the dam.</p>
        <p>When the time came, the villagers exchanged houses of mud, with thatch roofs and no electricity, for solid new places with electricity and plenty of water. They traded muddy ruts for paved streets. Everyone should have been happy, but no one seems to be.</p>
        <p>''In old Samsat we were growing many different things: corn, melons, lentils, fruits,'' Fevzi Kural, 59, said as he sat in the yard of his government-issue house with his family, threading tobacco leaves onto string for drying. ''We could work in many fields and we were supporting each other. There was a vitality to life. We are missing very much the old Samsat.''</p>
        <p>Occasionally residents walk to the lake and strain for a glimpse of their past. More enterprising, or desperate, souls borrow a small boat and row toward the memories. Until last year the minaret was still visible to guide them. Now there is nothing.</p>
        <p>As the muezzin called worshipers to afternoon prayer at one of two handsome mosques built by the government in new Samsat, men removed their shoes and paused in the shade of the portico. They, too, spoke fondly of the lost village and complained bitterly about the new one. The only jobs are in the tobacco fields, they said. The government has brought no industry. We are forgotten.</p>
        <p>Asked whether anything is better now, they answered in unison: ''Yok. Yok.'' (''Nothing. Nothing.'')</p>
        <p>The scene evoked a Kurdish fable about the bulbul, or nightingale. The bird was caught and put in a gilded cage. Despite the grandeur, the nightingale cried every night to return to its nest.</p>
        <p>The demise of Samsat, one of the first villages evacuated when the Ataturk Dam went into service in 1990, caused no ripple outside the region.</p>
        <p>But in recent months the imminent drowning of sites with archaeological appeal has sparked an outcry across the world that Turkey is cannibalizing its history. Some have even protested that the project is a plot to wipe out Kurdish culture.</p>
        <p>Turkish officials shake their heads at the criticism. In the past they were criticized for failing to bring economic development to the southeast. Now they are criticized for doing so. They also said that excavating and rescuing significant sites had been a component of the project for more than two decades and there had been dozens of digs. And in this crossroads of civilization, where two great rivers have nourished life for thousands of years, there are those who say some losses are acceptable.</p>
        <p>''You have to make choices,'' said Toni M. Cross, director of the Ankara branch of the America Research Institute in Turkey, a consortium of American and Canadian universities. ''If you are a politician in a democracy, you'd better consider the living as well as the dead. I'm a classical archaeologist, and I'd rather not lose anything. But I like having electricity.''</p>
        <p>Still, some losses must be mourned, and few sites in the region match the breathtaking beauty and drama of Hasankeyf. The old town sits below towering limestone cliffs on a sweeping curve in the Tigris, east of Diyarbakir. The cliffs and surrounding hills are riddled with 5,000 cave dwellings more than 2,000 years old. Some are still occupied, with numbers on the outside; one near the top sports a satellite dish.</p>
        <p>At the summit are the ruins of two small castles and an Assyrian-era church later transformed into a mosque. Far below, in the rushing river, are the remains of a 12th-century bridge, once regarded as the grandest in Anatolia.</p>
        <p>Six miles downriver is the site of the planned Ilisu Dam, which will create a 200-square-mile reservoir and flood about 80 villages in seven or eight years. With about 5,000 residents, Hasankeyf is the largest of the doomed settlements.</p>
        <p>Government officials say they improved the resettlement process after learning from mistakes in places like Samsat. Residents of Hasankeyf are being consulted about where to build the new village and what type of businesses and crops might thrive.</p>
        <p>But the consultations cannot erase the fear. Some foreign companies involved in the Ilisu Dam have expressed concerns about the controversy that may jeopardize the dam's construction, though it is unlikely that Turkey would cancel the dam, because of its importance to the overall project.</p>
        <p>Ibrahim Apalday, 25, grew up in Hasankeyf, swimming in the Tigris and hiding in the caves, just as children were doing one morning as he sipped tea in town. He now works in the family butcher shop. Single and articulate, he could make a fresh start in Diyarbakir or Istanbul when the flood comes, but he does not think about a new life.</p>
        <p>''After we lose Hasankeyf,'' he said with a shrug of resignation, ''it doesn't make any difference where we live.''</p>
