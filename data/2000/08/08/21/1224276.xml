        <p>What's halfway between ''Touched by an Angel'' and ''The X-Files''? It's ''Mysterious Ways,'' a new series that NBC has been previewing on Mondays this summer, ahead of the show's run starting tomorrow night on the Pax network, NBC's family-friendly corporate cousin.</p>

        <p>What's halfway between ''Touched by an Angel'' and ''The X-Files''? It's ''Mysterious Ways,'' a new series that NBC has been previewing on Mondays this summer, ahead of the show's run starting tomorrow night on the Pax network, NBC's family-friendly corporate cousin.</p>
        <p>Like ''The X-Files'' this drama features an appealingly mismatched man and woman trying to explain the unexplainable. But in these tales the unknown forces are unimpeachably good, not evil; they come not from Mars, but from another celestial address.</p>
        <p>Although ''Mysterious Ways'' does not explicitly invoke God, as ''Angel'' does, the new show is built upon the same conviction that earthly problems yield to divine solutions. Like ''Angel,'' and a thousand pop pieties from Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley, ''Mysterious Ways'' is a one-size-fits-all exercise in faith without any of the responsibilities or requirements of actual religion. That doesn't mean the show isn't pleasant entertainment. It won't stir your soul, but it might warm your heart.</p>
        <p>The series's central characters are Declan Dunn, an anthropology professor, and Peggy Fowler, a psychiatrist. Declan (played with a bit of goofy charm by Adrian Pasdar) has made a sideline of investigating what he calls ''miraculous phenomena'' since he was unaccountably rescued from an avalanche by a boy on a snowmobile who just appeared out of nowhere and quickly vanished.</p>
        <p>In the pilot episode, which Pax is showing tomorrow, he meets Peggy (Rae Dawn Chong) at the hospital where she works. Declan has come there to check on a boy who fell into an icy lake and was saved from sure drowning by an unseen hand. Declan and Peggy, the hunter after miracles and the levelheaded scientist, are opposites that attract.</p>
        <p>''I'm perplexed by you,'' she says.</p>
        <p>He replies, ''Get in line.''</p>
        <p>The pattern for the series, which was created by Peter O'Fallon and Carl Binder, is established as Peggy joins Declan and his quirky graduate assistant, Miranda (Alisen Down), looking for every reasonable explanation for the boy's survival. Was it a miracle? What do you think?</p>
        <p>Tonight on NBC, which will broadcast new episodes weekly through Labor Day, the investigators go to a town where a bus load of schoolchildren were killed 10 years earlier in a collision with a train at a rail crossing. The locals, who have never gotten over the tragedy, believe that the children's ghosts now protect the crossing; any car that stops there is somehow pushed off the tracks to safety.</p>
        <p>The story takes a clever turn or two, although the dialogue and much of the acting, especially among the townspeople, is wooden. More problematic is the relationship between Declan and Peggy. They seem to kind of like each other, but there's no electricity there. The most interesting character remains Miranda, the unsmiling but brilliant graduate student. She dresses in black, rides a motorcycle and locates elusive data when she should be grading Declan's anthropology exams.</p>
        <p>''I don't get her,'' Peggy says of Miranda.</p>
        <p>Declan replies: ''What's not to get? Take your I.Q., double it, add black velvet, and you're halfway there.''</p>
        <p>Is there an implied conflict here: the shadowy Miranda vs. the good Dr. Peggy? And what happens back on campus, when Declan is alone with his sultry assistant? Must he endure some devilish trial by temptation?</p>
        <p>Nah. This modest little show couldn't support that kind of weight. Besides, in this realm of convenient, plot-resolving miracles, heaven can triumph with no competition from hell.</p>
        <p>MYSTERIOUS WAYS</p>
        <p>NBC, tonight at 8  (Channel 4 in New York)  Pax, tomorrow night at 8  (Channel 31 in New York)</p>
        <p>Peter O'Fallon and Carl Binder, creators and executive producers; Jonathan Goodwill, producer; Melissa Byer, Treena Hancock, Dawn Ritchie and Keri Young, co-producers. Produced and distributed by Lions Gate Television.</p>
        <p>WITH: Adrian Pasdar (Declan Dunn), Rae Dawn Chong (Peggy Fowler) and Alisen Down (Miranda).</p>
