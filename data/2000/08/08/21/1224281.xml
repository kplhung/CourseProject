        <p>Amy Bloom is a psychotherapist. She is also a writer whose first book of short stories, ''Come to Me,'' was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1993 and whose most recent collection, ''A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You,'' was recently published by Random House to critical praise.</p>
        <p>''Some of the traits that led me to be a psychotherapist are the ones I find in myself as a writer,'' Ms. Bloom said. ''I've spent a lot of time listening to people, and I am endlessly intrigued by relationships, particularly by the gap between what people say and what they truly feel, and the gap between what they do and what they really want.''</p>

        <p>Amy Bloom is a psychotherapist. She is also a writer whose first book of short stories, ''Come to Me,'' was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1993 and whose most recent collection, ''A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You,'' was recently published by Random House to critical praise.</p>
        <p>''Some of the traits that led me to be a psychotherapist are the ones I find in myself as a writer,'' Ms. Bloom said. ''I've spent a lot of time listening to people, and I am endlessly intrigued by relationships, particularly by the gap between what people say and what they truly feel, and the gap between what they do and what they really want.''</p>
        <p>Janet Maslin, reviewing the new collection in The New York Times, said Ms. Bloom, in her ''sharply wrought stories,'' writes ''warmly and astutely, with arresting precision,'' about the tangled webs of human connections.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bloom said her career as a writer essentially began about a decade ago, when she was returning home from an appointment with the man who was to train her as a psychoanalyst. A graduate of Wesleyan University who also has a certificate in social work, Ms. Bloom, then in her mid-30's, was a mother of two young children and a psychotherapist in Durham, Conn.</p>
        <p>Although she was about to undertake the several years of additional training to become a psychoanalyst, ''I was still not entirely sure,'' Ms. Bloom, 47, said in a telephone interview from Provincetown, Mass., where she was teaching a workshop on writing fiction. ''And after one session the plot of a mystery came to me, and I started scribbling it on a McDonald's box from one of my kids. When I got home, I wrote up my notes. I had 15 pages, and I thought, 'That's interesting.' I sent a note to the training analyst that I wanted to hold off. And he said: 'If you change your mind, let me know. Otherwise, good luck with your writing.' ''</p>
        <p>Good luck she has had: her stories have appeared in The New Yorker, Antaeus and Story, among other publications, and were selected for the 1991 and 1992 ''Best American Short Stories'' collection and the 1994 O. Henry Prize anthology. Her first novel, ''Love Invents Us,'' was published in 1997 to excellent reviews. And ''The Story,'' a tale from her new book, has been chosen for the ''Best American Short Stories'' volume for this year.</p>
        <p>She also wrote that mystery novel. ''When HarperCollins bought 'Come to Me,' it also bought the mystery,'' Ms. Bloom said. ''But about a year or two later, after 'Come to Me' came out, I thought better of it and bought the mystery back. I just didn't think it was good enough.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Maslin, in her review of ''A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You,'' said Ms. Bloom's stories focus on ''exotic intimacies'': unusual relationships, unconventional liaisons, perhaps those connections that take place on the edge. The title story, for example, concerns the closeness between a mother and her daughter, who is soon to have surgery to make her a man.</p>
        <p>In two stories, ''Night Vision'' and ''Light Into Dark,'' Lionel and Julia, a black man and his much older white stepmother, deal with the sexual encounter they had one night years earlier. And ''Rowing to Eden'' is about the relationship between a woman undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, her husband and her best friend, a lesbian who has had a mastectomy herself.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Bloom said, ''The aspect of a story that is unusual is often not the thing that catches my eye.''</p>
        <p>'' 'Rowing to Eden' came out of my interest in a longstanding friendship between two women,'' she added. ''And that was combined with my having encountered, as everyone does, lots of breast cancer in friends and friends of friends. So I didn't think that there could be something unusual here. The story just grew out of what the characters came to be.''</p>
        <p>The only story in the collection that strikes her as unusual, she said, is the title one, ''because not that many people are transsexual.''</p>
        <p>''Part of what drew me to that story,'' Ms. Bloom said, ''was thinking about the way a good mother is devoted to her daughter, and the way in which mothers and daughters try to spare each other certain kinds of pain, and inevitably cause each other certain kinds of pain. I had encountered families with transsexuals, and I knew I couldn't tell the story from the point of view of the transsexual. That's not in my range. But I knew what it was like to be a devoted mother, trying to take care and offering your best self but grieving as well.''</p>
        <p>Critics have said that the characters in the stories casually break various taboos. ''In the world people do break all sorts of taboos,'' Ms. Bloom said, ''although they mostly don't like to talk about it. All of us have lines we have crossed at least once in our lives that we would just as soon not mention to other people.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bloom grew up on Long Island, in Great Neck, ''which,'' she said, ''was probably not the town to which I was best suited.''</p>
        <p>''On the other hand,'' she said, ''if you're going to be a weird little kid like I was, I'm not sure if any town would be suited to you. I was definitely one of nature's observers. I loved to read a lot of 19th-century literature, which probably didn't do a lot for my playground skills. From the time I was a little kid I was waiting to grow up. At 9, for my birthday, I was asked what I wanted, and I said, 'my own apartment.' ''</p>
        <p>Her life eventually got better. ''Like most bookish little kids I was always very interested in what other people were doing,'' she said. ''I didn't develop an adequate set of social skills until my early teens. I was one of those rare people for whom adolescence was an improvement over childhood.''</p>
        <p>After a year at Boston University she transferred to Wesleyan, in Middletown, Conn., and became a therapist.</p>
        <p>''Writing has made me less available as a therapist,'' she said. ''I had to make a decision on whether to go on having a full-time practice or to write more. I now have a very small practice. I didn't end treatment with people who were in the middle. But when people ended, I didn't fill those hours. I guess I've had two careers I've really loved.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bloom's children are ''all more or less big people now,'' she said. She has a 35-year-old stepson and two daughters, 21 and 18. She is somewhat circumspect about her own relationships. ''I have been divorced, and I am happily living with someone,'' is all she will say.</p>
        <p>She still lives in Durham, ''a very small town,'' she said, not far from Wesleyan. ''I originally wanted a nice town with a good school system, and my former husband was teaching at Wesleyan,'' she explained. ''Now my children say, 'Mommy, you can move where you want.' But I find myself thinking, 'I like the library, I like the backyard, I like the garden.' I've become enamored of small-town life.''</p>
        <p>And she remains enamored of writing. ''I'm working on new short stories,'' she said, ''and a couple of them are linked to two in the new collection. There will be two more stories in the Lionel and Julia group. There are certain characters I'm just not done with, or they're not done with me.''</p>
        <p>She is also working on a nonfiction book for Random House, about female-to-male transsexuals. It is based on an article she did several years ago for The New Yorker, itself an inspiration for the title story in her new collection.</p>
        <p>''It will be a larger look at people who occupy complicated gender territory,'' she said, ''as well as other people in their lives: surgeons, psychiatrists, makeup artists, people who run the clothing stores that cater to cross-dressers.''</p>
        <p>After that book, she said, she will write another collection of stories. Her love for therapy has, at least for now, been overtaken by her love for words. ''I hope to be writing,'' she said, ''for another 40 years.''</p>
