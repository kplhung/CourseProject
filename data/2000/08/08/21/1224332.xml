        <p>Univision Television Network and Telemundo Network Group, nation's leading Spanish-language networks, come under fire for not having enough dark-skinned Latinos on and off the air and for relying on imported programming that all but ignores Latinos in US; critics say Spanish television should help familiarize immigrants with the American way of life and draw together Latinos of different nationalities; another criticism is that telenovelas, the popular soap operas, often perpetuate sexism, racism and antigay sterotypes; networks buy foreign shows because they are cheaper than creating new ones and because people watch them; photos (M)</p>

        <p>On any given Saturday night, a television host known as Don Francisco holds sway in hundreds of thousands of American homes for four straight hours with a throwback to American variety shows of the 1950's, and more. The Miami-based television show ''Sabado Gigante'' (Giant Saturday) grabs viewers with a mix of musical performances, contests, comedy, interviews and audience sing-alongs.</p>
        <p>On weeknights, millions of viewers tune in to ''telenovelas,'' the short soap operas with rags-to-riches plots. The genre has been spiced up considerably this year with the addition of ''Xica'' from Brazil, which features nudity and a love story between a willful slave and her former master.</p>
        <p>And on weekdays, there is ''Laura en America,'' a Peruvian talk show where Jerry Springer meets Mother Teresa. The hostess, Laura Bozzo, is a legal scholar and women's rights advocate who is also known as the Eva Peron of Peru for creating a foundation to help the poor and unfortunate, many of whom appear on her show to slap and shove each other.</p>
        <p>This is what the fastest-growing television audience in the nation watches on Univision Television Network and Telemundo Network Group, the two Spanish-language networks. In major markets like New York, the Univision affiliates now outperform some English-language broadcast stations in the Nielsen ratings.</p>
        <p>The high ratings reflect the steady growth of Latinos in this country, now estimated to be about 32 million, but as they draw more viewers, Univision and Telemundo are drawing more criticism.</p>
        <p>Hispanic organizations boycotted the four big English-language networks last year for the scarcity of Latinos in television and got a few commitments to increased diversity. Now, some of the same groups are pressuring the two Spanish-language networks to address concerns like the invisibility of dark-skinned Latinos on and off the air and the preponderance of imported programming that all but ignores Latinos in the United States.</p>
        <p>''The viewership is fighting many different barriers to equality in this country and I think one is entitled to expect a little better from these folks given that reality,'' said Juan Figueroa, president and general counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York.</p>
        <p>Univision, which dwarfs Telemundo by capturing about 80 percent of the Spanish-language television audience in the United States, is the fifth-most-watched television network in the nation, after NBC, Fox, ABC and CBS. But while the Big Four have been bleeding viewers, Univision has been gaining hundreds of thousands of them.</p>
        <p>In some cases, the Spanish-language programs are essentially versions of the popular English language formats: the talk show ''Cristina,'' the tabloid show ''Primer Impacto'' (''First Impact'') and the early morning show ''Despierta America'' (''Wake Up America'').</p>
        <p>But newscasts on Spanish-language television, for which Univision has won two Emmy Awards, offer more coverage of Latin America and Latinos in this country than anything available in English.</p>
        <p>And, unlike the major networks, Univision and Telemundo anchor their prime time on ''telenovelas,'' offering a block of three, four and even five in a row on weeknights.</p>
        <p>Viewers, it seems, cannot get enough of them. Of the 20 top rated shows in Spanish nationally, 15 are telenovelas, Nielsen figures in early August showed.</p>
        <p>Unlike the English-language soaps, which can last generations, telenovelas typically wrap up their tortuous plot lines in less than a year and thus offer a beginning, middle and end. Hernan Velez, 40, a truck driver from Queens who is a fan of ''Xica,'' said he watches it as an escape.</p>
        <p>''It's a way to forget about work,'' he said. ''I just relax.''</p>
        <p>Many young Latinas who list shows like ''The West Wing'' and ''Sex and the City'' as favorites somehow find themselves hopelessly addicted to telenovelas, too.</p>
        <p>''I always say I won't watch the one that's getting started but I do and I get hooked,'' said Yesenia De Avila, 28, an entertainment editor at the magazine Latina, who was born in the United States to Colombian and Honduran parents.</p>
        <p>She even admits to clicking on ''Sabado Gigante'' on a slow Saturday; she said most of her Hispanic friends who were born in the States find the show ''cheesy,'' but she cannot resist it.</p>
        <p>But not all viewers are happy with their choices. Many are rankled by the dominance of programming from Mexico, Venezuela and elsewhere in Latin America that has little to do with the lives of people in this country. Critics say that Spanish television should play a larger role in familiarizing immigrants with the American way of life and to link Latinos of different nationalities.</p>
        <p>But the only original sitcom or drama currently dealing with the Latino experience in the United States on Spanish television is Telemundo's ''Los Beltran,'' which is set in Burbank, Calif., and features a first-generation Cuban-American family with a daughter married to a Mexican-American and with a gay couple as neighbors. (Both Univision and Telemundo have announced two new original sitcoms for the fall season based on Hispanics living in the United States.)</p>
        <p>Yet Alex Nogales, president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, a watchdog group, points out that this country is full of story lines.</p>
        <p>''How about a Mexican-American man who meets an immigrant woman and the clashes of culture?'' he said, naming one. ''They're not doing enough programs that take into consideration the culture, the education and legal institutions that are here.''</p>
        <p>Industry experts say the networks buy foreign shows because they are cheaper than creating new ones and because people watch them. Telemundo officials, who said they import 60 percent of their programming, said that not only do many Latin American countries have television industries that produce quality programming, but that the foreign product is also widely accepted in the United States because of the multinational makeup of the audience.</p>
        <p>Accents, for instance, are not the big issue for Hispanic viewers that they are for most English-speaking Americans, the officials said.</p>
        <p>''If NBC could produce novelas in Ireland that would work in the United States for a third of the cost, they would do it,'' said Joaquin F. Blaya, a former president and director of both Univision and Telemundo who is now chairman and chief executive of Radio Unica Communications, a national Spanish-language radio network.</p>
        <p>But Univision and Telemundo viewers often get a dose of old-fashioned sexism, racism and stereotypes. The telenovelas, for instance, have had the tendency to stick women to the traditional role of mothers or ''Cinderella,'' as in poor young girls whose only goal in life is to bag the upper-class leading man. Gay men are often depicted as caricatures. And servile roles are usually reserved for black, indigenous and dark-skinned actors.</p>
        <p>And the stars are so white and blond, critics like Mr. Figueroa said, that they seem to hail from Eastern Europe rather than Hispanic countries.</p>
        <p>''If you look at the Mexican novelas and you compare them to the Mexican people you see in New York, you'd think they were from two different Mexicos,'' agreed Charlotte Castillo, 28, a colleague of Ms. De Avila at Latina magazine.</p>
        <p>But unlike Ms. De Avila, Ms. Castillo said she seldom watches Spanish television.</p>
        <p>''I like 'E.R.,' 'The Practice,' 'Once and Again,' '' she said. ''You don't find these types of programs on Spanish-language television. I don't think it's very smart. Spanish-language television is like a decade behind.''</p>
        <p>Even Telemundo's ''Xica,'' a telenovela from Brazil that broke with tradition by having a black woman as its star, is too unpalatable for some viewers. Loosely based on the true story of the Brazilian slave Xica da Silva, who won her freedom and rose to a position of power thanks to her wit and wiles, the drama, which is dubbed in Spanish, stands out for the nude scenes (albeit in blurred, censored images) involving Xica and the other slaves.</p>
        <p>''Again, as a black woman you're seen as an object of oversexuality,'' said Evelyne Laurent-Perrault, a founder of ''Encounters, Inc.'' an East Coast group of black Latinos that advocates racial inclusion. ''To me it isn't any improvement of television.''</p>
        <p>There are also complaints that some Hispanic groups are underrepresented on Univision and Telemundo. Marco Camacho is president and chief executive of Hispanic Television Media Network, a network begun from Texas this year to focus on Mexican-American viewers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Camacho noted that Mexican-Americans account for more than 60 percent of the nation's Hispanic population but are a minority among the hosts and actors in productions made in the United States, which come mostly from Miami, where Univision and Telemundo have their studios.</p>
        <p>''The Mexican market doesn't have the same likes and dislikes as the Cuban or Puerto Rican markets,'' he said. ''They want to hear jokes that they can understand.''</p>
        <p>Members of the National Hispanic Media Coalition in New York and Los Angeles said that over the last year they had met several times with Henry G. Cisneros, Univision's president until he resigned this month to form a housing company, to voice their concerns. With revenues approaching $1 billion a year, critics said, it is time for Univision to produce more of its own programs, or at least have more say in what is produced abroad, and deal with the issue of diversity.</p>
        <p>Univision's chairman and chief executive, A. Jerrold Perenchio, does not give interviews and forbids network officials to do so, a policy cited by the network's publicists for declining requests for interviews.</p>
        <p>James McNamara, Telemundo's president and chief executive, said his network would have more original productions as its target audience -- Latinos from 18 to 49 who speak only or mostly Spanish or who are bilingual -- grew. But Mr. McNamara said Telemundo needed to compete ''head on'' with Univision by offering telenovelas and other imported programming.</p>
        <p>Nely Galan, producer of ''Los Beltran,'' said that the time had also come to put the onus on the viewers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Galan said she had counted herself among the networks' critics until she became Telemundo's president of entertainment in 1998 and got ''a reality check.'' At that time Telemundo took the telenovelas off the prime-time lineup to experiment with new programming like documentaries and original productions.</p>
        <p>By August 1999, the telenovelas were back and most of the new shows were out.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, the demand is not as high as you'd think for original productions,'' said Ms. Galan, who noted that ''Los Beltran'' survived but that its audience was slow to build.</p>
        <p>''Latinos are used to watching the same things,'' she said. ''It's time to change that.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Galan said Spanish-language programming was bound to improve as English-language television started mining the bilingual market with shows like Showtime's ''Resurrection Boulevard.'' But she said competition can only do so much.</p>
        <p>''We really have to make people understand the power they have as viewers,'' she said.</p>
