They will then begin recovering the bodies of the 118 crew members and try to salvage the submarine's nuclear reactors.</p>

        <p>Top Southern Democrats Offer Gore Little Support  Several prominent Democratic politicians in the South have been keeping their distance from Vice President Al Gore as they begin their own general election campaigns. Their decisions seem to illustrate the South's general indifference to Mr. Gore's appeal, and demonstrate how hard he will have to work to capture even a few states in the region.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore renewed his attacks on drug companies and health maintenance organizations and vowed to bring broader and fairer health coverage to all Americans. Campaigning in Illinois and Iowa, Mr. Gore also said he would push for a patients' bill of rights to protect HMO consumers and for adding a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program.</p>
        <p>A18</p>
        <p>A senior adviser to Mr. Gore accused Gov. George W. Bush of trying to dodge, or at least minimize the impact of, presidential debates, while one of Mr. Bush's top aides said the governor was willing to debate but was still considering more than 40 invitations from an array of potential sponsors.</p>

        <p>A Scare Led McCain to Act  Senator John McCain was recovering at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, awaiting a determination by pathologists on whether the melanoma removed from his temple had spread. Mr. McCain's experience with a delayed response to his first melanoma in 1993 led him to act much faster this time.</p>

        <p>New Jobs for Lumberjacks  As high-tech companies face labor shortages in cities, they have begun to branch out to areas passed over by the boom, bringing jobs and training. But for places like Coos Bay, Ore., once a center for the wood-products and fishing industries, there are painful twists. Many new jobs pay less than the old ones and require people used to physical outdoor work to sit at computers.</p>

        <p>New Police Commissioner Reaches Out to Minorities  Bernard B. Kerik, New York City's new police commissioner, visited a black church in East New York, Brooklyn, where he asked the congregants to ''give me a chance'' to succeed. He said he has told officers that wrongdoing would be punished. But he also said that mistakes by officers need not inflame relations with the community if there is understanding and respect on both sides.</p>

        <p>Complaints for Spanish TV  The nation's fastest-growing television audience watches Univision Television Network and Telemundo Network Group, the two Spanish-language networks. In New York, the Univision affiliates now draw higher ratings than some English-language stations. But the networks are also criticized for a lack of dark-skinned Latino employees and for using too much imported programming.</p>

        <p>Tourists Flow to Hudson Valley  Tourism officials say that after years of getting lost between the hyperkinesis of New York City and the tranquility of New England, the Hudson Valley seems to have arrived. Tourism is at an all time high, with the amount of money spent on lodging almost doubling in 10 years. Some 25 million people visit the Hudson Valley a year, and their spending adds about $2.5 billion to the local economy.</p>
