        <p>PURPLE CANE ROAD  By James Lee Burke  341 pages. Doubleday.$24.95.</p>
        <p>Near the beginning of this new police mystery by James Lee Burke, a man with the exotic name Vachel Carmouche is hacked into his constituent body parts -- all clearly identified by Mr. Burke -- by a woman wielding a mattock.</p>
        <p>Near the end, a state official named Jim Gable is found inside the trunk of a car with his body wrapped in a plastic wardrobe bag. This scene, too, is described with graphic succintness by Mr. Burke: ''He had inhaled the bag into his mouth, so that he looked like a guppy trying to breathe air at the top of an aquarium.''</p>
        <p>There are many more imaginative murders in ''Purple Cane Road'' and lots of bruising, bludgeoning, hacking and slicing in a novel that tries hard to be atmospheric, hard-boiled, charged with brutality. Set in the racially troubled, Creole-accented Louisiana backwoods, Mr. Burke's novel comprises several intertwining stories of sexual abuse, political corruption, murder and revenge. The characters range from a prostitute named Little Face Dautrieve to an ambitious attorney general, Connie Deshotel, to a drunken private eye, and they are an aromatic group, each giving off a highly individual smell.</p>
        <p>But redolent of the bayou as it is, ''Purple Cane Road'' remains a meandering contrivance, a set of apertures in which Mr. Burke makes visible about as much seediness and mortality as is reasonably possible to cram into a mere 341 pages. He provides a tingle here and there and a luscious sense of deep South iniquity, but his book's psychedelic straining for ever more stylized killings perversely robs it of that sense of plausibility and unexpectedness necessary for genuine suspense.</p>
        <p>The main character and narrator will be familiar to readers of Mr. Burke's previous books. He is Dave Robicheaux, a homicide detective in the sheriff's office in Iberia Parish, outside New Orleans. Robicheaux is a recovering alcoholic and a good guy even if he is prone to clubbing people from time to time with his heavy fists. He only does this when he is angry and to people who really deserve it, but he is angry often and many people seem deserving.</p>
        <p>Robicheaux's first concern is that Letty Labiche, a former prostitute and the murderer of Vachel Carmouche, was abused by her victim for years while she was growing up with her twin sister in the house next door. As the action gets under way in ''Purple Cane Road,'' Letty has been on death row for eight years, and her execution is approaching, unless Robicheaux can find some extenuating circumstances to prevent it.</p>
        <p>As Robicheaux interviews prostitutes and pimps, trying to get something new on the Carmouche murder, someone tells him that his own mother, who disappeared mysteriously years before, was murdered by police officers because she had seen them do away with somebody else.</p>
        <p>Robicheaux investigates, asking about his mother's disappearance, learning of seedy connections between the police and the Giacano organized-crime family. But soon, out of nowhere, the man who told him about his mother's death, a wiry pimp named Zipper Clum, is shot dead by a hired assassin. The same assassin then goes to kill Little Face Dautrieve, though he seems to change his mind at the last minute, showing that he is an assassin with, possibly, a conscience.</p>
        <p>Who wants these people dead? Who killed Mae Guillory, Robicheaux's mother? And can Letty Labiche be saved from lethal injection?</p>
        <p>Robicheax assiduously works on all three questions at once, helped out by Clete Purcel, his alcoholic sidekick who has no interest in overcoming his drinking problem, or, for that matter, his own inclination to beat people up. Sometimes alone, sometimes in Purcel's troubled company, Robicheaux tours the Louisiana underbrush, winging about by car and by boat.</p>
        <p>As the deaths accumulate, everybody seems to be vaguely suspect, including Attorney General Deshotel; Gable, a police liaison officer; Gable's wealthy, semi-invalid wife, Cora; and Cora's creepy chauffeur, Micah. Everyone seems capable of knocking someone else off in this book, and several of them do so, but most of the murders are committed by the hired killer who blew away Zipper Clum (after hacking off his arm with a machete). This is Johnny Remeta, a smart maniac who torments Robicheaux by charming his impressionable teenage daughter.</p>
        <p>In other words, Mr. Burke's plot is as thick and tortuous as a Louisiana swamp, and while there is certainly nothing wrong with that, some matters, like motivation and the trail of evidence, seem at times to disappear in the murk. It's not that Mr. Burke leaves behind large logical holes, but rather that the degree of mayhem does not seem justified by the stakes involved. Remeta, the murderer in chief, is a psychopath and maybe doesn't need motivation, but his appearances out of nowhere have a Wizard of Oz quality and seem out of place in a novel whose sense of rootedness is likely to be important to its author.</p>
        <p>Robicheaux, with a terse sort of solidity, is a man of a few well-chosen words. He speaks to his colleagues in something close to code, with about as many metaphors for knocking somebody off as there are people knocked off in this novel.</p>
        <p>''I had the chance to plant one in Johnny Remeta's cauliflower and didn't do it,'' he tells his chief.</p>
        <p>''You froze?'' the chief asks him.</p>
        <p>''I had him set up,'' Robicheaux says. ''I was going to cut all his motors.''</p>
        <p>But while Robicheaux may be laconic, he discloses plenty about his interior life, including his dreams, his moods, his sense of despair, his sometimes clumsy efforts to set things right. He is very human, and he gives this novel, despite its nonstop violence, its strong moral sense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke also entertains with his knack for the underside of the human experience and with his characters' jaundiced disregard for the corrupt human heart.</p>
        <p>But ''Purple Cane Road'' is so stylized, so devoted to its own appearances, that it comes across as almost a commentary on itself rather than as something real, a novel whose characters genuinely cry out when they are hurt.</p>
