        <p>In the largest youth gathering ever held in the West, more than two million young people prayed, sang, swayed and got sprayed with water hoses today at a Mass celebrated by John Paul II on a hot, dusty, trash-strewn field in a suburb of Rome.</p>
        <p>The youth Mass and an overnight vigil before it closed a six-day World Youth festival timed to coincide with a Roman Catholic Holy Year, a gathering that the Italian press dubbed ''The Catholic Woodstock'' -- a teeming love-in without the sex, drugs or rock 'n' roll, but with much of the same enthusiasm and abandon.</p>
        <p>One overwrought young girl burst through security lines on Saturday night and hurled herself into the frail pope's arms as if he were a pop star, and he gently patted her head as she wept on his shoulder.</p>
        <p>''It is like a rock concert in some ways, huge masses of people getting really excited, but really, it's about spirituality, not entertainment,'' said  Claire Heyne of Dallas, who graduated from college in the spring.</p>
        <p>But the festival, which drew hundreds of thousands to packed prayer services at churches throughout the city, mass confessions at Circus Maximus, and the Stations of the Cross at the Colosseum, was as much a Special Olympics of the soul -- a huge, often grueling effort by young Catholics to show the world that not all of today's youths live in a secular, morality-free zone.</p>
        <p>''One of the main principles of this whole thing is to prove to people that the new generation still believes,'' Etienne Corpechot, 18, a high-school student from Paris, said as he squatted amid a sea of rumpled sleeping bags and cardboard boxes in scorching 98-degree heat waiting for the pope to begin Mass. And his was a point that John Paul II, who turned 80 last May, welcomed with visible relish and relief.</p>
        <p>''Our society desperately needs this sign, and young people need it even more so,'' the pope said in his homily today, ''tempted as they often are by the illusion of an easy and comfortable life, by drugs and pleasure seeking, only to find themselves in a spiral of despair, meaninglessness and violence.''</p>
        <p>The turnout for this World Youth Day, the 15th since John Paul II created the event in 1984, exceeded even Vatican expectations, which hovered at 1.5 million. It was the largest papal event ever held in Europe, drawing two million people, according to city officials, and topping the previous World Youth Day, which gathered more than one million in Paris in 1997. Only the World Youth Day in Manila in 1995, which drew up to four million people, was larger.</p>
        <p>Pilgrims began streaming in Tuesday, staying in convents, priories, hostels and public school buildings that the city began planning to make available two years ago for the event. But on Saturday night more than a million people slept on sleeping bags, cardboard boxes and plastic bags in the open air of a vast, arid field belonging the University of Rome in preparation for the pope's Mass today.</p>
        <p>The huge numbers, and a lapse in organization, brought the day to a chaotic end. Pilgrims, who were supposed to leave in scheduled waves, instead left en masse, swarming into the one metro stop near the field, flooding highways and bus stops and overwhelming the transportation system.</p>
        <p>Mostly, however, the event was a personal triumph for the pope, who prides himself on his rapport with young people and has long viewed the Holy Year of the new millennium as a cornerstone of his papacy. Frail, and shaking from the symptoms of Parkinson's, the pope nevertheless beamed throughout Saturday night's three-hour candlelit ceremony, tapping his armchair to the music and at the end swaying both arms above his head as if joining a human wave.</p>
        <p>''I return, rejuvenated,'' he told Saturday's cheering crowd, noting approvingly that ''Rome has never heard such a noise before.''</p>
        <p>But there also were some tears of fatigue and frustration, as young pilgrims, who invaded a deserted Rome, found themselves walking for miles in tight packs, or crammed into trams in stifling heat. Many were lodged on the floors of empty schools, modestly donning bathing suits to take outdoor showers.</p>
        <p>Mostly, however, young people from Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia sang as they walked, cheerfully shrugging off discomfort.</p>
        <p>''I am used to the heat, and I have no right to be sleepy if the pope can make it,'' Sabin Sonhaye, 29, a student from Togo, said at the Saturday night vigil. He saw the pope in his own country in 1984, when he was 14, but said he had wanted to experience a World Youth Day ever since viewing a video cassette of the Paris event. He, like others, expressed a desire to renew their faith with like-minded young people. Others said they reveled in a city that for a week seemed doused with religious feeling.</p>
        <p>''There are as many churches here as there are gas stations in Los Angeles,'' Lucy Kim, 22, of Gardena, Calif., marveled.</p>
        <p>The huge masses left their mark. This week so many young pilgrims wanted to pass through the Holy Door of St. Peter's, a Holy Year ritual, that the Vatican opened a second one for the first time in church history. After 500,000 people walked with candles to recreate the Stations of the Cross along the Via dei Fori Imperiali, next to the ancient Forum, the entire street was closed off for four hours the next day so sanitation workers could scrape up the melted wax on the pavement.</p>
        <p>To reach today's Mass at Tor Vergata, a suburban campus of the University of Rome, many pilgrims had to walk more than six miles from the end of a subway line under a broiling sun, carrying boxed meals and six-packs of bottled water. At least 2,000 people were treated in first-aid tents Saturday and Sunday, and ambulances, which ominously circled the area like buzzards, took more than 40 people to the hospital.</p>
        <p>Even the pope's opening greeting at St. Peter's on Tuesday, which drew 300,000 into St. Peter's Square, was a trial for some.</p>
        <p>''I was on point, it was insane,'' said Jesse Randall, 16, of Seattle, explaining that he had led his Catholic youth group into the teeming square. ''It was fun,'' he said. ''I was born for it. It was like a mosh pit, except nobody was wielding chains.''</p>
        <p>Some of the Roman merchants who stayed in town and witnessed the youthful invasion were less than enthusiastic about pilgrim spending habits.</p>
        <p>''They came in ten at a time, and only one bought anything,'' Fabrizio Sagnotti, who runs an eye-wear store on Via del Corso, groused to the Italian news agency Ansa. ''They created a big confusion, and that is all.''</p>
        <p>RAI, Italy's largest network, covered the major events of the festival live, and the Saturday night vigil won a 28 percent share of the television audience. Some intellectuals expressed diffidence about the lavish, doting attention the Italian news media paid to the festival.</p>
        <p>''Are a million and a half or even two million young people touring Rome in the Jubilee worth more than the more than two million crowding Adriatic beaches without crosses and litanies?'' Eugenio Scalfari, the retired editor in chief of La Repubblica, asked in a front-page editorial in his paper on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Pilgrims, however, expressed no regrets. ''Getting here was an incredible hike, and at times I have asked myself why did I make this trip,'' Linda Muraski, 46, of Knoxville, Tenn., said as she and her 16-year-old daughter Allison kneeled by the cot of their group leader, Patrick Donovan of Wilmington, Del., who had fainted from heat stroke and lay inert and hooked up to an IV in a Red Cross tent on Saturday evening.</p>
        <p>''But then you get into the middle of the most beautiful Mass,'' she added, ''and there is the pope, with you, and it is so moving you forget all you went through to get there.''</p>
