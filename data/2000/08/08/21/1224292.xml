        <p>In the video game world, when players face bleak prospects -- a hero loses ''health points,'' or a spaceship's shield is depleted -- they have the ultimate recourse: hit the reset button.</p>
        <p>It is an option rarely available in the business world, but Electronic Arts, the world's leading independent game company, has such a fresh start in mind.</p>
        <p>The company, which makes dozens of sports, action-adventure and strategy games for PC's as well as for game consoles made by Sony, Nintendo and others, is weathering a market in great flux. Sales have been in a lull, awaiting the full emergence of a new generation of faster, more powerful game consoles.</p>
        <p>Consider the bleak outlook on July 25, when Electronic Arts announced a fiscal first-quarter loss of more than $42 million on revenue of $154.8 million and warned of losses nearly as great in the second quarter. The news was in stark contrast to the company's modest profit in last year's first quarter. And because the report came after the stock market's close that day, most investors had no immediate way to vent their concerns.</p>
        <p>The next morning, though, investors were ready to pounce -- and they did so by bidding up the company's stock nearly 15 percent.</p>
        <p>Why such enthusiasm for a money-losing quarter? Evidently, investors share the optimism of Electronic Arts' executives, who during one of the game industry's cyclical downturns have been spending heavily preparing for the future.</p>
        <p>Electronic Arts invested some $700 million on an ambitious two-prong strategy that its president, 41-year-old John Riccitiello, asserts will propel it to new prominence in the video and PC game industry. And the intensely focused, hypercompetitive Mr. Riccitiello says the strategy could help move games beyond their core audience (adolescent males of all ages) to become an entertainment medium in which people can interact with others across the globe and compete with one another in a new generation of Internet-based games.</p>
        <p>''Instead of being comatose on the couch, you'll be on the couch role-playing, fantasizing, competing, shooting or driving,'' Mr. Riccitiello said, suggesting that the TV, connected to the Net, will become the preferred medium for online game play.</p>
        <p>He even predicts that the popularity of Internet-based games could surpass the appeal of TV programming because players will become immersed in elaborate cyberworlds rather than merely watching someone else's drama unfold.</p>
        <p>''You'll interact with other people. You'll get to date, marry, murder -- it's all there,'' Mr. Riccitiello said. ''By next summer, these games will start to look like legitimate competition for TV.''</p>
        <p>The next two months should give some indication of whether Electronic Arts' big bets can pay off.</p>
        <p>About half of its investment, or roughly $350 million, has been spent developing an online gaming site called EA.com (www.ea.com), which begins its first public tests later this week or early next before its official debut in September. EA.com will be going up against a handful of already well-established game sites and will soon face additional competition from heavyweights like Sega and Sony, both of which have major gaming portals planned.</p>
        <p>The online investment includes $81 million in cash and equity in EA.com that the company gave to America Online to make EA.com the exclusive operator of AOL's game channel. Electronic Arts plans to spin off EA.com as a tracking stock in the first half of 2001, Mr. Riccitiello said.</p>
        <p>But those millions of dollars do not include the cost of adding a proposed fourth and fifth building to the company's Silicon Valley campus -- a proposed increase of 315,000 square feet of space -- in part to accommodate the expected growth of EA.com. The local government in Redwood City, Calif., has yet to approve the expansion.</p>
        <p>Already, the company has devoted three floors of an existing building to the development of online games. In cubicles, engineers and game writers are preparing games and setting specifications. In a modest, early-version of the EA.com control room, two engineers oversee large video monitors that relay traffic patterns from several sports games Electronic Arts already operates online, including the golf games Tiger '99 and P.G.A. Tour, of which tens of thousands of rounds are played online each month via Electronic Arts server computers.</p>
        <p>But online gaming is only around half the big bet. The other half is about $350 million placed on producing games for Sony's next console.</p>
        <p>In October, roughly a month after the start of EA.com, Sony plans to make the United States debut of the Playstation II video game console, which is already a best seller in Japan and eagerly awaited by game players in this country. Electronic Arts has gambled heavily that the Playstation II will be a success, surpassing the 72 million Playstation I consoles already in use worldwide. It is, in fact, among those predicting that sales of the new machine could eventually exceed the 100 million units.</p>
        <p>The $350 million spent developing games for the new Sony machine, a major investment by game-industry standards. At the same time, Electronic Arts made a controversial decision not to make games for the Sega Dreamcast introduced last year, deeming the system would not be sufficiently popular to justify the $3 million to $4 million it costs to develop individual games.</p>
        <p>The Playstation II will be a 128-bit machine, meaning its main chip processes information 128 bits at a time -- or effectively twice as fast as the 64-bit chip in the current market leader, the Sony Playstation and the No. 2 machine, the Nintendo N64. The 128-bit speed is supposed to allow startling realism, as with car racing games that appear to be TV footage.</p>
        <p>The losses that Electronic Arts reported last month reflects the fact that, for much of this year, the game industry in this country has been in a lull -- awaiting not just a new version of the Playstation, but also 128-bit machines expected next year from Microsoft and Nintendo. While the lull is considered cyclical within the industry, it has nonetheless slammed the revenues of video game companies, sent stock prices lower across the industry and forced considerable consolidation among smaller game developers.</p>
        <p>As soon as the Playstation II hits the market, the company plans to have as many as five new games for it -- titles that include SSX snow-board racing and Madden Football 2001. Four or five additional new titles are in the pipeline for Christmas, which could mean that Electronic Arts may have more than half the available Playstation II titles on the market by the holidays.</p>
        <p>Eventually the company hopes to corner 30 percent of the game market for the Playstation II, compared with Electronic Arts' 20 percent share for the current Sony players.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Riccitiello insists that Electronic Arts has not put all its eggs in the Playstation II basket. He says the company diversified beyond video games the last several years by bolstering its game business for personal computers. The PC game category now represents 30 percent of its total revenue. The PC share is up from 15 percent a year ago, an increase attributable in part to the success of the Sims series, made by Electronic Arts' Maxis subsidiary. Players build cities, neighborhoods and control day-to-day municipal activities in SimCity, or even control individual characters in the most recent game, the Sims.</p>
        <p>Industry analysts, however, believe that the success of the Playstation II titles will largely determine the success of Electronic Arts the next two or three years.</p>
        <p>Billy Pidgeon, an analyst with the research firm of Jupiter Communications, said that Electronic Arts had emerged with a stronger market position with each transition to a new console. ''The one thing that could hurt them is if Playstation II doesn't do well,'' Mr. Pidgeon said, ''but that's hard to imagine.''</p>
        <p>But it is the Internet gambit that presents an even riskier and more complex challenge, industry analysts say.</p>
        <p>The idea of playing computer and video games online is nothing new. In fact, online game playing is brimming with competitors, including uproar.com, iWin.com, Zone.com, a site operated by Microsoft and WON.net, which has an extensive following. These, like at least the initial version of EA.com, are meant for use with PC's. And some analysts say Electronic Arts will need to demonstrate it can compete in this league.</p>
        <p>Greg Kasavin, senior editor at Gamespot.com, an online publication about electronic games, said that so far, Electronic Arts' online offerings, including a medieval, role-playing fantasy world called Ultima Online, had been harder to use than many of its competitors' services.</p>
        <p>But David Cole, an industry analyst and president of DFC Intelligence, a San Diego market research firm, said the online game market was still too new and unproved to predict winners and losers. ''Right now, the online gaming market is fairly spread out,'' he said. ''There is no dominant player.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cole said that Electronic Arts had put EA.com in a good position by aligning it with with AOL. ''The key to online games is distribution,'' he said, ''and with AOL they have the key distribution point.''</p>
        <p>Besides operating as a separate Web site, EA.com will be the ''game channel'' on America Online, which will receive 4 percent of the channel's revenue -- with the first $81 million in payments already accounted for in the recent stock and cash transfer.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, Mr. Riccitiello sees an expanding opportunity in more powerful video game consoles and PC's, as well as faster Internet connections. He notes that people are already playing relatively simple games, like pong, on current computer-based game sites that draw between five million and six million people. More sophisticated online play could double the size of the $13 billion video game market in the next five years, he predicts.</p>
        <p>The popularity ''is on a curve pointing to the sky, and the content is miserable,'' Mr. Riccitiello said. ''E.A. is going to change all that.''</p>
        <p>The EA.com site will begin with 50 games, which will include basic parlor and card games, and sports titles like Running Back Challenge, a relatively simple game in which players try to evade a computer-operated tackler. The company acknowledges it will be several months before EA.com includes more elaborate, graphics-intensive games.</p>
        <p>Assuming all goes well with the initial free trial of EA.com, Electronic Arts plans to begin charging money for some levels of access. Some of the games will remain free. But for the more elaborate ones, the company plans to use a subscription model, possibly with two tiers costing $4.95 and $9.95 a month respectively.</p>
        <p>Besides vying with the existing online game operators, Electronic Arts will also be wading into online competition with both Sony and Sega,  also leading producers of game software. (Nintendo, the other big console maker, also intends for its upcoming 128-bit console, known as Dolphin to have online access and is exploring plans to have a game site).</p>
        <p>The Sony Online Entertainment division operates the Station (www.station.sony.com), a PC-based game portal offering games like Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy online. And the Playstation division plans to introduce an online component for the Playstation II, once high-speed, or broadband, connections are more widely available.</p>
        <p>Sega plans to open its own game site on Sept. 7. Sega's site will be designed for use only with its Sega Dreamcast consoles. If users commit to buying two years of Internet access from the company's SegaNet service, for $21.95 a month, Sega will give them Dreamcasts at no additional charge.</p>
        <p>Whatever the intensity of the online play, the offline battle promises to become nasty between Electronic Arts and Sega.</p>
        <p>Electronic Arts executives are predicting the Sega site will have limited demand, since it restricts the potential audience to Dreamcast owners. But Sega officials fire back that Electronic Arts will be unable to offer consistently high-quality, realistic game play because the company has no control over the type of hardware its players will be using.</p>
        <p>Charles Bellfield, a spokesman for Sega of America, said he had played early versions of EA.com in a closed beta test -- a sort of private dress rehearsal. The ''experience is awful,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''E.A. has not been able to rectify that, because it is always dependent on the hardware'' owned by its users, Mr. Bellfield said.</p>
        <p>Executives at Electronic Arts, meanwhile, say Sega had no business exploring their company's beta test. ''It's like breaking into Lockheed in the 80's, seeing the B2 bomber sketched on the back of a napkin and predicting it'll never fly,'' said Jeff Brown, a company spokesman.</p>
        <p>He contends that Sega has handcuffed itself by dedicating its online play to its own hardware. ''Building a site that is tied to a poor-selling console starts with a tremendous handicap; they are building for a limited audience,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The sniping no doubt traces to Electronic Arts' decision not to develop games for the 128-bit Sega Dreamcast, which has had sales of 2  million consoles in the United States since its introduction a year ago, and 5.5 million worldwide.</p>
        <p>In the fall of 2001, Nintendo is expected to introduce Dolphin, while Microsoft plans to jump into the fray with its 128-bit console, the X-Box, around the same time. Mr. Riccitiello predicted those companies could each sell 50 million to 60 million consoles, and he said Electronic Arts was discussing with Microsoft and Nintendo whether to produce games for their new machines. (Nintendo has sold about 28 million N64 consoles worldwide.)</p>
        <p>People close to Electronic Arts expect the company to support those platforms, and not only because they could generate significant sales. If Nintendo and Microsoft do not thrive, Sony could end up with no viable competition for the Playstation II, which in turn could allow Sony to charge higher licensing rates to video game makers like Electronic Arts that make software for its console.</p>
        <p>And over the long haul, healthy competition could stimulate continued technological improvement in the machines, which combined with high-speed Internet connections could bring ever-more-lifelike online play. Or so Mr. Riccitiello hopes.</p>
        <p>He likes to describe a day, not too far in the future, when instead of tuning in to ABC or NBC, couch potatoes will turn to Electronic Arts.</p>
        <p>''We believe, based on a mountain of evidence, that if we can create a sports game that also is a place for you to live 24 hours a day, seven days a week, you might actually have a better life in cyberspace,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And if that happens, Mr. Riccitiello is betting that Electronic Arts can have a better life in cyberspace, too.</p>
