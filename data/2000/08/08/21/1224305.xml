        <p>Fox Spinoff Has Benefited Some More Than Others  When Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, spun off 20 percent of Fox Entertainment Group to the public in November 1998, he was trying to convince investors that the company's entertainment assets were more valuable than investors were giving News Corporation credit for.</p>
        <p>The move has been better for News Corporation shareholders than for Fox shareholders. Since the spinoff, stock in Fox Entertainment has climbed just 20 percent, a far smaller increase than other media stocks, including Viacom, Walt Disney, Time Warner, Seagram -- and News Corporation itself, which has risen 85 percent.

        <p>When Modern Sounds Like Oldies  As it nears its 10th anniversary as a radio format, so-called modern rock is at a crossroads. Modern, also called alternative, is the style that established itself as the first to play new music, like that of Limp Bizkit, led by Fred Durst. But the format has begun to sound commonplace, leading listeners to ask: What exactly is modern rock radio an alternative to? [C7.]</p>
        <p>More Taking Than Giving on the Web  Software programs like Napster and Gnutella have achieved a reputation for fostering a communal spirit of sharing among millions of music-loving computer users. The reality may be more selfish. Two scientists at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center have surveyed the behavior of anonymous music downloaders and have found that, rather than demonstrating a ''from each, to each'' ethos, most Internet users are only taking files and not giving back to their electronic community.

        <p>Music Videos Are Going Digital  An increasing number of music videos are being produced specifically for the Internet. To suit its intended medium, the video's creators use software that crams its saturated colors and lively animation into a relatively compact file for fast downloading. The cost is compressed, too, with a budget far below that of a full-scale music video. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Marketing Enters the E-Mail Era  Among Internet companies struggling to retain customers, e-mail marketing is seen as the next best thing to being on the home page each time a customer goes online. E-mail is a relatively inexpensive marketing tool, provides immediate results and can be measured. But conducting an effective e-mail campaign is complicated, with challenges ranging from basic privacy issues to technical hurdles. E-Commerce Report. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Deal Maker Turns to Technology  Irwin L. Jacobs, who became wealthy by taking big stakes in Fortune 500 conglomerates in the 1970's and 1980's, usually with the goal of unlocking value by breaking them up, never seemed overly fascinated by new technology. A company left over from his corporate raider days, Genmar Holdings, is the nation's second-largest leisure boat manufacturer, a labor-intensive segment that has been slow to invest in new technology. But now Mr. Jacobs plans to hold an open house at a factory to show off a compact, enclosed computer-controlled manufacturing system that can be remotely operated over the Internet. New Economy.

        <p>Soda Maker Seen on Auction Block  Britvic, one of Britain's largest soft-drink manufacturers, is for sale as part of a strategy by Bass to focus on its hotel business, executives said. Analysts say the company could be sold for more than $500 million. [C6.]</p>
        <p>A Makeover for Foreign Policy  No longer will Foreign Policy, the 30-year-old publication of the the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, concentrate on relations between governments, on military policy, or on the domestic politics of an important American ally. Instead, the magazine, remade from its elegant slim size into a bigger, flashier format that resembles the celebrity magazine Talk, will concentrate on ''global politics, economics and ideas.''
