        <p>IT is never fun to be cut. In high school sports, the process can be as simple as scanning a list posted on the gymnasium wall.</p>
        <p>''Wait. Maybe Coach misspelled my name.'' Right.</p>
        <p>In the arcane world of gymnastics, they make the cuts in public. With the cameras turned on. They let everybody perform and then they announce: ''Everybody who is going to Sydney, take one step forward. Not so fast, Abernathy.''</p>
        <p>Not that they had to, but the officials did not adhere to the standing in the men's trials on Saturday night, and they did not totally follow the final results of the women's trials last night. They dropped Vanessa Atler, who had finished sixth, and upgraded the golden oldie Dominique Dawes, who had finished seventh but was improving with every event.</p>
        <p>Dawes was such a popular choice that even Atler seemed to accept it -- better than a lot of aspirants who don't survive the first cut for high school varsity.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't my day, it wasn't my time,'' Atler said. ''I think everybody wanted it more than I did.''</p>
        <p>Atler did say she would have gone if the committee had chosen her for the top six. But she told her coach she would not go as an alternate. Being dropped made her seem almost relieved, but maybe that was the perfectionism of a competitor who knows she had a bad weekend. Because the gymnastics federation never bothered to put the standing on a scoreboard, the process must have seemed mystifying to fans, who paid big bucks for something billed as the ''Olympic Team Trials.'' The real trial was held by Chief Justice Karolyi and his colleagues in chamber.</p>
        <p>However, the operative word in gymnastics these days is ''team,'' with more emphasis on specialists, which means the committee had more mandate to pick and choose.</p>
        <p>Last night the women's committee picked the first five finishers -- Elise Ray, Amy Chow, Kristen Maloney, Morgan White and Jamie Dantzscher, then jumped Dawes over Atler. Alyssa Beckerman, who finished eighth, was named the alternate.</p>
        <p>Shannon Miller had complicated the machinations by hobbling off after two dodgy vaults, and she withdrew from the trials. At first, Miller said that despite her weary legs she was still very much available should Karolyi want to draft her, which he did not.</p>
        <p>Dawes pleased everybody who wanted experience on the team by giving a mature and elegant performance. The crowd booed judges who gave her a low mark on the floor, and then the crowd called Dawes back for a wave after she more than survived the beam. Karolyi gave her a hug, which proved prophetic a few minutes later.</p>
        <p>''I never said I had the right to be on the 2000 team,'' said Dawes, who was on the 1992 and 1996 teams, a clear reference to Miller's statements in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>The officials say that they are looking only for improving technique, that leadership is not a factor, but on both nights they juggled the standing to account for two positive adults and veterans, Dawes and John Roethlisberger.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Paul Hamm figured he was safely ensconced in second place but his fraternal twin, Morgan, was in a quite precarious sixth, right ahead of good old reconstructed Roethlisberger, a very ancient 30 and everybody's big brother.</p>
        <p>''I was so nervous,'' Morgan said. ''If I didn't make the team, we'd be separated for really the first time in our lives.''</p>
        <p>What was the rationale for making the athletes get the word in public? It came from Peter Kormann, the men's team coach, who thought that the fans in the upper reaches of the sprawling Fleet Center deserved to find out at the same time as the athletes.</p>
        <p>Kormann, it should be noted, is a true son of New England, where they used to put people in the stocks and burn alleged witches.</p>
        <p>''They're men,'' Kormann repeated yesterday. ''They're warriors. They walk out here and raise their hand and get on the pommel horse. They can handle this, too.''</p>
        <p>Maybe yes, maybe no. In front of a packed arena, Paul Hamm heard the announcement that Jamie Natalie had been consigned to alternate. This could only mean that Morgan had made the top six. Paul patted Morgan on the back. They were going to Sydney together. Natalie is still playing good soldier about his very public demotion.</p>
        <p>Athletes don't get to this level without learning to deal with direct competition. There is something very finite about the way track and field does it. Dan O'Brien aced nine events in the decathlon trials in 1992, but he could not get over the bar in the pole vault and was thereby denied a trip to Barcelona.</p>
        <p>However, in gymnastics, under the new rules, the men will send six competitors, but only five will be entered in each of the six events, and only the top four scores will count.</p>
        <p>Kormann and Karolyi were both looking for specialists. Gymnastics is getting to be like the real team sports -- nickel backs on passing defense, setup relievers in baseball, short-handed specialists in hockey, expendable lummoxes who hack Shaquille O'Neal six times and foul out.</p>
        <p>In this technological age, the fans could have used some standings -- if only to compare them with the squad lists that were finally posted on the gymnasium wall.</p>
