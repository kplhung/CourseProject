        <p>Joe Torre can share his unedited emotions with the world every day to condemn, confront or blame, as manager of the Yankees. But he seems to sift carefully through his thoughts, to identify the most presentable, and he might have required a giant mental colander after the Yankees gave away another game yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Yankees led Anaheim, 3-0, when Torre replaced David Cone after six innings yesterday. The bullpen allowed four runs in the seventh and another in the eighth and was responsible for a 5-4 loss at Yankee Stadium, the second time in three days the Yankees' bullpen blew a sizable lead.</p>
        <p>Torre plaintively answered questions afterward. He reiterated how excited he is about how Cone is pitching now; what Torre did not say, as his decisions indicated, is that his confidence in Cone is not restored fully. Torre mentioned again how important reliever Jeff Nelson is to the bullpen, and how he expects Nelson will work through his recent inconsistency; he did not elaborate on Nelson's unhappy response to being taken out yesterday, or how he intends to address Nelson's mounting frustration.</p>
        <p>Torre has credited the bullpen time and again for much of the Yankees' success this season. He did not offer the reality that right now, his middle relief is something of a mess, and somewhat responsible for the Yankees' inability to pad their slender lead in the American League East. They are 5-5 in their past 10 games, playing mediocre teams in the Texas Rangers and the Angels.</p>
        <p>''It's unfortunate,'' Torre said of yesterday's loss, ''but it's not that we're going to do anything different. We'll still send those guys out there.''</p>
        <p>They probably should have walked away from this four-game series with Anaheim with four victories. They could have beaten the Angels on Friday, if they had not blown a five-run lead in the ninth inning -- only the second time the Yankees had done that in Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>They could have added a fitting finish yesterday, Whitey Ford Day. The Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, who takes these sort of events seriously, was in the clubhouse for the first time in weeks and greeted most of his team's most recent acquisitions by extending a handshake and a slap on the shoulder -- David Justice and Jose Canseco and Glenallen Hill -- and spoke glowingly of what they had added to the team. ''How could anyone debate that?'' Steinbrenner said rhetorically. ''What they've done is incredible.''</p>
        <p>Ford was touched by his ceremony, shook hands with Cone before throwing out the first ball, and Cone pitched well, changing speeds, striking out the side in the first inning. He fell behind in the count at times, but did not allow a hit until the fourth. Clay Bellinger, filling in for the injured center fielder Bernie Williams, twice drew walks and scored on run-scoring hits by Luis Sojo. The Yankees led, 3-0, after five, although they could have had at least one more; Sojo had run through the stop sign raised by the third-base coach Willie Randolph and was thrown out at the plate in the fifth.</p>
        <p>Cone threw 79 pitches in the first five innings, and after Orlando Palmeiro singled with one out in the sixth, the interim pitching coach Billy Connors visited the mound. Cone appeared annoyed by this, turning his head with exasperation when he saw Connors and relievers warming up in the bullpen. He had allowed two hits and a walk to that point and knew he was on the verge of being replaced.</p>
        <p>Cone had 96 pitches after six innings and with the left-handed slugger Mo Vaughn scheduled to lead off the seventh, Torre -- intending generally to replace him at about 110 pitches -- decided to replace him. Cone lobbied to stay in the game, ''for the first time in a long time,'' without success.</p>
        <p>Torre's response, Cone said, was: '' 'You're starting to crawl now and you're breaking into a jog and you're on your way. Let's take the positive and I'm going to get you out of there.' Sure, maybe there is a little bit of a mixed message there. But Joe has his reasons, and I'm not going to second-guess him.''</p>
        <p>Mike Stanton took over in the seventh, walked Vaughn and allowed a two-run homer to Tim Salmon. Two batters, two runs. After Garret Anderson grounded out, Nelson relieved Stanton and walked Troy Glaus on four pitches -- the eighth time in Nelson's past 13 appearances he has allowed a walk or a hit to the first batter he has faced.</p>
        <p>Glaus stole second easily, taking advantage of Nelson's big leg kick. Nelson struck out Bengie Molina, but Adam Kennedy poked a grounder inside the third-base line, Glaus scored the tying run, and the booing was loud and pointed.</p>
        <p>The switch-hitter Kevin Stocker was scheduled to bat next, and Torre preferred to force Stocker to bat from his weaker side, as a right-handed batter; he also was wary of Kennedy swiping second. So Torre called on the left-handed rookie Randy Choate. Nelson said something to Torre before he left the mound, an expression of unhappiness. Nelson explained afterward that he feels he should be used more, that this would give him a better chance of sorting through his recent wildness.</p>
        <p>Nelson was asked if he feels Torre has lost confidence in him. ''I don't know -- it doesn't bother me if he does or not,'' Nelson said. ''I mean, who else is he going to go to? I think I've been one of the most consistent guys down there, so if that's the case, then we're in trouble.''</p>
        <p>Choate threw to first once, driving Kennedy back to the base, but word is out that Choate has trouble holding runners. Kennedy stole second uncontested, and when Stocker fought off a good pitch and flipped a blooper over the second baseman Sojo's head, Kennedy scored.</p>
        <p>Dwight Gooden allowed a run in the eighth, and Anaheim led, 5-3, negating the solo homer hit by Hill in the bottom of the inning, Hill's 10th in only 51 at-bats for the Yankees. The Yankees had a couple of runners on base with two out in the bottom of the ninth, but Paul O'Neill lined to left to end the game.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have benefited from the most significant midseason makeover in the history of baseball, and almost every player they have added has made major contributions. But check today's standing: the patchwork Boston Red Sox are only a few good days away from overtaking the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Torre may or may not be concerned about the Red Sox, about Nelson, about his middle relief. He sees the big picture and says good things.</p>
