        <p>Piotr Naimski, the former head of the Polish secret services, has some moral qualms about what he is doing, but he says that Lech Walesa, anti-Communist hero and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has a moral problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walesa, who is running a quixotic campaign to be elected once more as Poland's president, was cleared on Aug. 12 of charges that he collaborated with the Communist-era secret services and reported on the activities of his friends and fellow shipyard workers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Naimski, one of the first members of KOR, the Workers' Defense Committee that led to the Solidarity trade union, says he believes that Mr. Walesa did collaborate, and he testified against him in the closed vetting trial.</p>
        <p>He says he did so reluctantly, and with a heavy heart. In a long interview, he said first that what bothered him most was the continuing security risk of a hidden collaboration. But it became clear that what really seemed to bother him was hypocrisy. He says Mr. Walesa could have easily confessed to youthful collaboration without harming his political standing or historical reputation -- and in fact could have enhanced both.</p>
        <p>''Walesa has failed a moral hurdle,'' Mr. Naimski said finally. ''He has made a mistake by not going openly to the public, and he has missed an important chance.''</p>
        <p>It all ''seems bizarre,'' Mr. Naimski said, staring into space. ''Walesa will go down as a positive historical figure and as a Polish president -- what else is there? But still. . . .''</p>
        <p>Was Mr. Walesa lucky in the court's verdict? Mr. Naimski smiled thinly. ''He's lucky, yes.'' He laughed. ''And the rest is left for God.''</p>
        <p>The Poles have come late to the vetting game, now 11 years after Communism collapsed, and the process has been clumsy. Perhaps like the French after World War II, there is a popular desire to assume that everyone was really part of the resistance and that the same pressures put on East Germans, Czechs and Hungarians to collaborate with Moscow and the Communist secret police were better resisted here.</p>
        <p>This process has not been smooth or particularly successful anywhere in the former Soviet bloc, in part because of the ease of faking or manipulating files built on the products of spies and informers. Still, the issue of who cooperated with the secret services and who did not is a moral touchstone. The problem is deciding -- for certain -- who is innocent and who is guilty, and proving that someone is lying when they say they did not do what certain documents indicate they did.</p>
        <p>Mr. Naimski, a biochemist and anti-Communist, ran the Polish secret services, now known as the State Protection Office, in 1992, when the process to screen people suspected of being Communist collaborators began. He helped prepare a list of 64 people that year who were named as spies in the police records, including Mr. Walesa, then the Polish president. Mr. Walesa's name was included on the list, Mr. Naimski now says, after a wrenching internal debate about the virtues of honesty versus political discretion. But a parliamentary committee later concluded that Mr. Walesa had signed no agreement with the police.</p>
        <p>Unlike most of the world, Mr. Naimski has seen Mr. Walesa's file, where the former Gdansk shipyard electrician is alleged to have been an agent, code-named Bolek, who spied for the secret police in the early 1970's -- before Mr. Walesa rocketed to fame in 1980 as the feisty, salty leader of Solidarity.</p>
        <p>No one contends that Mr. Walesa collaborated during the Solidarity period or afterward, and during the closed trial the secret services revealed a 1985 Interior Ministry report that documents had been faked in 1982 to try to prevent Mr. Walesa from winning the Nobel Peace Prize, which he was awarded in 1983.</p>
        <p>While these fakes were said to have been important in the clearing of Mr. Walesa, Mr. Naimski says that he was aware of them in 1992 and that what troubles him are other, earlier files.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walesa, now 57, has regularly denied charges of collaboration at any time. After he was cleared, he called the whole affair ''an incredibly repulsive game.'' At the same time, he bemoaned the fact that the vetting trial -- in a process known as lustration, after the Czech term -- did not seem to clear his name.</p>
        <p>''I am a little sick at heart because I had trusted in the lustration,'' Mr. Walesa said. ''Now I see it has no point because the whole operation did not convince anyone.'' And Mr. Walesa is particularly angry at Mr. Naimski and former Interior Minister Antoni Macierewicz, who both testified against him in the hearing.</p>
        <p>''I trusted that at least one of them would shift one way or another,'' Mr. Walesa told Polish Radio. ''But it turns out that it was all too hard. Their money, their books, and their entire philosophy and existence is based on this conviction. Now they can't go back on this. Would they give the money back to those whom they tried to deceive?''</p>
        <p>These charges pain Mr. Naimski, a thin, ascetic-looking man of 49, who is now teaching foreign and security policy at a private business school in the southern town of Nowy Sacz. Mr. Naimski is also an adviser on the staff of Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, a member of the Solidarity coalition who heads a minority government. But Mr. Naimski denies that the government or the Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski, also running for president, manipulated the legal process in any way.</p>
        <p>Mr. Naimski favors lustration, would like the entire process to be ''transparent, open and public,'' unlike its current secrecy, and yet understands that any vetting system that relies on informants and secret service files must be ambiguous and subject to manipulation. ''In the end, these are moral questions, not legal ones,'' he said. ''The courts are not the best way to answer moral questions.''</p>
        <p>A 1997 law requires the vetting of those seeking high public office. It is not a crime to have collaborated. But anyone who denies it and is found to have lied is banned from political life for 10 years. This presidential election is the first time the law has been used.</p>
        <p>Mr. Naimski believes the special court that cleared Mr. Walesa did so on special, technical grounds. He says that the court did not find certain original documents sufficient proof that Mr. Walesa was lying, and he says that many other documents have been destroyed since 1989.</p>
        <p>Mr. Naimski has other concerns, which are about state security. ''This is not a problem of collaboration, but of counterintelligence,'' he said. Secret collaborators may still be blackmailed, he said, especially by former Communist party apparatchiks and secret service officers who have moved, almost seamlessly, into the new economy. Many, Mr. Naimski believes, still have strong connections to their former colleagues in Russia, many of whom have also moved into the market economy.</p>
        <p>Poles like to talk of a ''Russian party'' of influence, which lately has been trying to win Polish approval of Russian plans to build a second natural-gas pipeline to Western Europe that will go through Poland and Slovakia, cutting out Ukraine, a Polish ally that Moscow is trying to bring back under control.</p>
        <p>''Are you surprised that Russia treats Central Europe as a lost jewel?'' Mr. Naimski asked. And he pointed out that it was not until days before Poland formally joined NATO that the former Communist opposition in the Parliament was persuaded to pass a strong law vetting the past of senior officials, as NATO membership requires.</p>
        <p>The former Communists, led by the current Polish president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, who was also cleared by the court, are expected to win control of the government in parliamentary elections likely in the spring. The former Communists say they intend to reexamine the current government's decision not to allow the Russian gas giant, Gazprom, to build a second pipeline through Poland, avoiding Ukraine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Naimski's position as a government adviser has also led to complaints that he should simply shut up and accept the verdict of the court. To those complaints, he simply shrugs. Asked if he considered himself Mr. Walesa's enemy -- as Mr. Walesa has charged -- Mr. Naimski again looked pained. ''I am not an enemy of Walesa,'' he said. ''I'm disappointed in him.''</p>
