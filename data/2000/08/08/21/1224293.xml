        <p>Several advertisers have made some decisions on accounts.</p>
        <p>DirecTV in El Segundo, Calif., a satellite television service that is part of the Hughes Electronics division of General Motors, named the Marina del Rey, Calif. office of Deutsch to handle its account. Billings were estimated at $65 million to $70 million. The account had been at the Los Angeles office of Campbell-Ewald, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, for more than six years.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a three-and-a-half month review that had been narrowed to Deutsch and two other finalists: the Los Angeles office of D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, part of the B Com3  Group; and GMO/Hill, Holliday in San Francisco, part of Interpublic.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles office of Mediavest North America, part of B Com3  will handle media planning; media buying remains at G.M. Mediaworks in Warren, Mich., a unit of Interpublic that handles media buying for the divisions of General Motors.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, Deutsch was awarded the assignment for a DirecTV programming package called the ''NFL Sunday Ticket,'' with billings estimated at more than $10 million.</p>
        <p>The Parmalat USA Corporation in Wallington, N.J., part of the Italian food company Parmalat S.p.A., named the Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, part of B Com3  to handle the introduction of a new product line of fresh, refrigerated milk products: Parmalat Milk-E, Skim Plus, 2 percent Lactose Free Plus and Fat Free Lactose Free Plus. Billings were estimated at $28 million. Allscope Media in New York will handle media planning and buying.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a two-week review in which Kaplan Thaler and three other agencies were considered. Overall branding and packaging design for Parmalat USA were handled by AG Worldwide in New York, part of the Draft Worldwide unit of Interpublic, until they parted ways at the end of last year.</p>
        <p>The Friendly Ice Cream Corporation, a restaurant chain with over 600 locations, named GMO/Hill, Holliday in San Francisco, part of Interpublic, to handle its account, including strategic planning, creative development and media planning and buying. Spending was estimated at $18 million.</p>
        <p>Maura C. Tobias, a spokeswoman for Friendly's in Wilbraham, Mass., said the decision came without a review. She added that Jack Connors, chief executive, and Richard L. Couch, senior vice president and chief marketing officer, were familiar with GMO/Hill, Holliday and had a ''high comfort level'' with the agency. The account had been handled by Berry-Brown Advertising in Dallas for less than one year.</p>
