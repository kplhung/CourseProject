        <p>Britvic, one of Britain's largest soft-drink manufacturers, is for sale as part of Bass P.L.C.'s strategy to focus on its hotel business, executives close to Britvic said today.</p>
        <p>Britvic, which owns Tango and other popular British soft drinks, is 90 percent controlled by a joint venture of Bass, Allied Domecq and Whitbread, in which Bass has a 50.1 percent majority stake. PepsiCo owns the other 10 percent as part of deal that allows Britvic to manufacturer and distribute Pepsi in Britain.</p>
        <p>Schroder Salomon Smith Barney has been hired to sell Britvic, which analysts say will probably raise about $:350 million pounds, or $522 million, as part of Bass's strategy to sell its noncore assets and focus on its hotel business, the executives said. Bass is one of the largest hotel operators in the world, with nearly 3,000 hotels under the Holiday Inn, Inter-Continental and Crowne Plaza names.</p>
        <p>In June, Sir Ian Prosser, Bass's chairman and chief executive, sold the company's brewery operations to Interbrew, a Belgian company, for $:2.3 billion, although that deal has come under scrutiny by British antitrust authorities.</p>
        <p>A Bass spokesman declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Possible bidders include PepsiCo, although the company's strategy of spinning off bottling assets runs counter to a purchase of Britvic.</p>
        <p>Company executives were not immediately available for comment.</p>
        <p>Britvic has attractive operating cash flow, which surged 36 percent in 1999, to $:41 million. For the first six months of this year, the company had an operating profit of $:9 million on sales of $:270 million. That compares with operating profit of $:8 million on sales of $:254 million in the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The current auction would not be the first attempt at a change of ownership for Britvic. Last autumn, Allied Domecq tried to sell its Britvic stake to Punch Taverns, which was also buying Allied's pub business. Whitbread, which lost out to Punch in the bidding for Allied's pubs, used its pre-emptive rights to eliminate the Britvic stake from the deal.</p>
