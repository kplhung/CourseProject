        <p>A young woman who joined hundreds of excited onlookers on Main Street on Saturday night to catch a glimpse of President Clinton stripped off her T-shirt in glee after the president signed it.</p>
        <p>The woman, wearing a bra, was immediately surrounded by law enforcement officials, who handcuffed her and questioned her until Mr. Clinton had left the area. She was later released.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't a big deal,'' said an officer with the Lake Placid Police Department. ''She was questioned, but that's it.'' The authorities did not release the woman's name.</p>
        <p>The incident occurred about 11:30 p.m. as Mr. Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea, stopped for ice cream on Main Street of this small resort town in northern New York after a birthday dinner for the president, who turned 54 on Saturday.</p>
        <p>On the street, Mr. Clinton had signed T-shirts of both men and women before he reached the young woman, who pulled out the bottom of her T-shirt for him to sign and enthusiastically hoisted the shirt over her head after he signed it.</p>
        <p>''He signed the bottom of her shirt and he turned away, and then she did a Brandi Chastain and ripped off the shirt,'' said a White House spokesman, Jake Siewert, referring to the American soccer star who took off her shirt and revealed her sports bra after her team won the World Cup finals last year.</p>
        <p>After the commotion, Mr. Clinton briefly turned back toward the woman before heading for his motorcade. Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea were nearby. Mr. Siewert called the incident ''less risque than a Sunday Times Magazine.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, as he emerged from dinner, the president revealed his birthday wish: that both his wife and Vice President Al Gore win their electoral bids.</p>
        <p>On his lapel was a ''Hillary for Senate'' pin.</p>
        <p>The Clintons were spending the weekend at the private home of a local real estate developer, Arthur Lussi, whose grandfather was an Olympic gold medalist. Lake Placid was the host of the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics.</p>
        <p>Today, after Mr. Clinton finished a round of golf and Mrs. Clinton made a campaign appearance in Buffalo, family members met in Chappaqua, N.Y., where they had established residency to qualify for Mrs. Clinton's Senate bid.</p>
