        <p>As if Vice President Al Gore did not have enough trouble in his native region, several prominent Southern politicians of his own party have been keeping their distance from him as they begin their own general election campaigns.</p>
        <p>The Democratic candidates for governor in North Carolina and senator in Georgia have avoided appearing with Mr. Gore and skipped last week's Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. The governor of South Carolina left the convention early and has dismissed Mr. Gore's chances in his state.</p>
        <p>Each has his own explanation, and no one will confess to a deliberate snub of the national ticket. But taken as a whole, their decisions seem to illustrate the South's general indifference to Mr. Gore's appeal and demonstrate how hard he will have to work to capture even a few states in the region.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, held a rally in downtown Atlanta on Aug. 10, there was no sign of Georgia's newest statewide Democratic candidate, Senator Zell Miller, the state's former governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller was recently appointed to replace the late Senator Paul Coverdell, and has only a few weeks to campaign to keep the job in a November special election. But rather than attend the convention, or spend the time campaigning, he chose to spend last week on a private, unannounced tour of Georgia's military bases, unaccompanied by reporters or cameras.</p>
        <p>The Democratic candidate for governor of North Carolina, State Attorney General Mike Easley, chose not to appear with Mr. Gore during a June visit to meet with flood victims, although the two men met privately.</p>
        <p>Mr. Easley has made it clear in various interviews that campaigning with Mr. Gore is not a priority for him. Mr. Easley made a speakerphone call to the North Carolina delegation at last week's Democratic convention but was criticized by some delegates for not appearing in person and for distancing himself from the ticket.</p>
        <p>Jim Hodges, the Democratic governor of South Carolina, left the convention rather conspicuously on Tuesday, before the acceptance speeches of Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodges, who has had a rocky political relationship with Mr. Gore, was quoted in The State, the Columbia newspaper, as saying Gov. George W. Bush has a ''99 percent'' chance of winning South Carolina, adding that he was not planning to work hard for the ticket. Mr. Hodges is not up for re-election this year, but is commanding a major campaign for a November referendum to create a lottery in the state that would provide more money for education.</p>
        <p>According to a series of recent polls taken before the convention, Mr. Gore was behind in every Southern state except his native Tennessee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore may be doing better after his convention appearance, but the earlier polls showed that he had been hurt by President Clinton's personal scandals, and his own positions on issues like gun control and the environment are seen as less congenial in the South than those of Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Democrats like Mr. Easley and Mr. Miller are the heavy favorites in their races, and Mr. Hodges is a popular figure in his state. All three seem painfully aware that voters in the region continue to distinguish between national Democrats and Southern Democrats.</p>
        <p>''It always happens, and you can bet it's going to happen in this year's races -- the Republicans are going to try to tie the state Democrats to the unpopular head of the national party,'' said Bill Moore, a professor of political science at the College of Charleston. ''From their point of view, it's just pragmatic politics to appear as independent from Gore as they can be.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Governor Hodges said he was not trying to be aloof by leaving the convention early; he said he had made a commitment to attend a fund-raiser for a state Senate candidate. But he obliquely suggested that Southern voters have different priorities from those voiced at the convention.</p>
        <p>''Moderate Democratic candidates can win in the South, if they focus on a core set of issues that voters care about,'' Mr. Hodges said. ''Too often, Democrats at the national level are identified with more liberal causes that send voters to the Republicans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodges backed off his earlier assessment that Mr. Gore had no chance in South Carolina, saying Mr. Gore's selection of Mr. Lieberman and his positions on education and Medicare might help him if he chose to campaign in the state.</p>
        <p>But many Southern Democrats are grumbling more openly that the Gore campaign has spent little time and money in the South, essentially freeing up candidates to go off on their own. Richard A. Harpootlian, the chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said the Bush campaign was still reaping the benefits of having spent at least $4 million in the state during the hotly contested Republican primary in February, while the Democrats have spent about $5,000.</p>
        <p>''The successful Democrats in the South have fought hard and swam against the current to win their elections,'' Mr. Harpootlian said. ''If the national Democrats want to come here and spend some money and work hard, they can do it, too. But so far, they're not.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Easley, the candidate for North Carolina governor, said much the same in a recent interview with The Charlotte Observer.</p>
        <p>''I want them to commit the resources, commit the effort,'' he said of the Gore campaign. ''If they do that, I think they can win the state.'' But in the absence of a strong national presence, Mr. Easley said, he has to run his own race, because ''there's not any room on the ticket for a weak campaign, top or bottom.'' Campaign officials said he was too busy campaigning to go to Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign insists it can be competitive in the South -- particularly in Tennessee, Florida and Georgia, and possibly North Carolina and Arkansas -- and plans to devote resources to the region, although Douglas Hattaway, a campaign spokesman, said he did not know precisely where Mr. Gore would appear.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore is a Southern New Democrat who has long favored a strong defense, welfare reform, fiscal responsibility, and values like that,'' Mr. Hattaway said. ''Those are the kind of issues that are important to Southern voters and New Democrats.''</p>
        <p>But Rick Dent, a spokesman for Senator Miller, said it might be the Southern Democrats who wound up helping Mr. Gore, a reversal of the conventional coattails theory. Mr. Miller, as a new senator, has been too busy learning the job and gearing up for his campaign to appear with the national ticket, Mr. Dent said.</p>
        <p>''But he is a strong vote-getter,'' Mr. Dent said, ''and it may just be that some of his supporters will decide to vote for Mr. Gore.''</p>
