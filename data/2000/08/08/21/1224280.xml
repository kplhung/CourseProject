        <p>Anita Durst and Despina Stamos are onto something with Deli Dances in Times Square. The free series provides the ultimate in New York serendipity to passers-by in the area. On Friday at lunchtime, camera-toting tourists, shoppers and office workers joined dance fans on comfortable banquettes to watch shrewdly chosen modern-dance pieces in a simple black-box theater in an empty store on 42nd Street near Broadway. Outside, dancers performed in the store's display window, attracting quite a crowd.</p>
        <p>Miguel Gutierrez and Erin Cornell opened the first hour of the all-day marathon that closed the series. Their untitled duet had the two, dressed in tennis skirts and tops, moving with enjoyably astringent energy to Latin music. Then came Bianca Falco and Elise Knudson in ''Interlude,'' an imaginative duet for two bodies joined at the hands.</p>

        <p>Anita Durst and Despina Stamos are onto something with Deli Dances in Times Square. The free series provides the ultimate in New York serendipity to passers-by in the area. On Friday at lunchtime, camera-toting tourists, shoppers and office workers joined dance fans on comfortable banquettes to watch shrewdly chosen modern-dance pieces in a simple black-box theater in an empty store on 42nd Street near Broadway. Outside, dancers performed in the store's display window, attracting quite a crowd.</p>
        <p>Miguel Gutierrez and Erin Cornell opened the first hour of the all-day marathon that closed the series. Their untitled duet had the two, dressed in tennis skirts and tops, moving with enjoyably astringent energy to Latin music. Then came Bianca Falco and Elise Knudson in ''Interlude,'' an imaginative duet for two bodies joined at the hands.</p>
        <p>The shapes Ms. Falco and Ms. Knudson made and the ways they clung to each other, pulled away and rebounded made for witty physical comedy with surprising emotional nuances. The ending, in which the two shared tea from a pot on a tiny table at the back, was a charming surprise and a perfect close to the piece.</p>
        <p>The dancers in Le Minh Tam's untitled group piece also made intriguing shapes, this time with a length of white fabric that served as a river, the boundaries of a stage within the stage and a screen. The large cast was divided into a group of bouncing, wheeling women in white dresses and four dancers in red and black who moved in a mix of the martial arts and contact improvisation genres. A shorter version of the work would have been much more effective, however, particularly in this setting.</p>
        <p>The improvisational duet by Andrew Suseno and Stacey Royce should have been dreadful but was inspired. Mr. Suseno and Ms. Royce are well matched and comfortable with each other as improvisation partners. But they also had a nicely relaxed way with the audience, soon having people call out ''stop'' and ''start'' to one or both of the performers. Some of the freezes were hilarious.</p>
        <p>Audiences came and went all the while, handed on through the dark theater by Julie Atlas Muz, the Bemused Blonde of downtown performance art and the afternoon's host. The audience comments were perceptive, enjoyably freewheeling and often fascinating, particularly given the blessed absence of the kind of discussions that are now de rigueur before and after dance performances. What about making Deli Dances a year-round event?</p>
