        <p>From New York's K-Rock to Los Angeles's KROQ, FM radio stations with a so-called modern format have flourished the last few years by promoting the cutting-edge sounds of grunge, electronica and the latest hip-hop and rock hybrids.</p>

        <p>From New York's K-Rock to Los Angeles's KROQ, FM radio stations with a so-called modern format have flourished the last few years by promoting the cutting-edge sounds of grunge, electronica and the latest hip-hop and rock hybrids.</p>
        <p>These and stations like WBCN in Boston and WKQX (called Q101) in Chicago say that they provide an alternative to traditional rock outlets, or that they broadcast, as the Dallas station KDGE likes to put it, on ''the edge.''</p>
        <p>So why is it, between all the slogans stressing up-to-the-minute hipness, that many of the songs are several years old from bands like Pearl Jam or Nirvana, while others -- like the razor-guitar blasts from Limp Bizkit or Korn -- can also be heard on hard-rock stations?</p>
        <p>As it nears its 10th anniversary as a format that the radio industry has assigned its own charts and demographic surveys, so-called modern rock is at a crossroads. Modern, also called alternative, is the style that established itself as first to play new music. But it has begun to sound commonplace, leading listeners to ask what exactly is modern rock radio an alternative to?</p>
        <p>''The lines are more blurred than they've ever been,'' acknowledged Steve Kingston, program director for K-Rock -- WXRK in New York, which has used the modern format since 1996.</p>
        <p>It is a problem programmers will have to face soon or risk losing their claim to the specific ''hip'' -- 18-  to 34-year-old professionals -- audience favored by some advertisers.</p>
        <p>Already, the modern format has nearly blended into its nearest competitor, hard or so-called active rock, which plays many of the same current rap-rock stars, like Papa Roach, Limp Bizkit and Korn. The overlap in active and modern playlists rose from 44 percent in 1998 to 54 percent last year, according to Airplay Monitor, a trade journal published by Billboard. More striking, 62 percent of both categories' top 10 lists were identical in an average of all of 1999.</p>
        <p>And Airplay Monitor's group editor, Sean Ross, notes that 15 songs from a recent week's modern top 20 were also on the active rock charts, which means that any new tracks from acts that merge hip-hop and metal, like Kid Rock and Rage Against the Machine, can expect to jump into both formats' heavy rotation as soon as they are released.</p>
        <p>The few self-described modern rock stations not leaning toward the active format, notably WLIR on Long Island and WPLY in  Philadelphia, find themselves mixing established Top 40 stars, like Sting and Madonna, with melodic newcomers like Nina Gordon.</p>
        <p>''I have to program against K-Rock,'' said Gary Cee, program director of WLIR, which transmits from Garden City and has a large geographic overlap with Manhattan-based K-Rock. ''And I want to do a cutting-edge radio station that still appeals to the mainstream.'' The result is a sound that borders closely on the existing adult contemporary format.</p>
        <p>If modern rock seems to lack focus, industry experts say, the blurring has a long history. ''Nothing is static in the music industry,'' said Jim Kerr, an editor at the trade publication Radio and Records. ''Over time, it's very difficult to put a very rigid definition to such a thing as a format. The music changes. The approach changes.''</p>
        <p>The so-called underground radio of the early 1970's -- FM stations playing bands like the Doors in stereo -- became the industry standard later that decade. By the 1980's, smaller stations began breaking away from this album-oriented rock format with New Wave artists like Talking Heads and U2.</p>
        <p>By 1990, this experimental mix was recognized as a separate format, usually called alternative in those days, with new charts to track such adventurous stations as WLIR, which switched formats in 1982, and WFNX in Boston, which began broadcasting in 1983. These were small stations, however, playing what Mr. Kingston calls a boutique format and often more akin to free-form college radio than to their markets' big-money rock establishments.</p>
        <p>That all changed in 1992. Early that year, the guitar-heavy ''Nevermind'' by Nirvana -- a band that only alternative stations had played before -- knocked Michael Jackson out of the top slot on the Billboard album chart. Other grunge and punk groups like Pearl Jam followed Nirvana's success, and  stations began switching en masse to the suddenly popular -- and lucrative -- alternative, or modern, format.</p>
        <p>The evolution from Aerosmith and the J. Geils Band to R.E.M. and the Pixies was gradual for many stations. But between 1994 and 1996 several major outlets, notably K-Rock in New York and WBCN in Boston, both owned by the giant Infinity Broadcasting jumped from the old-style rock to the new. ''Alternative didn't change,'' Mr. Kerr said. ''The mainstream moved.''</p>
        <p>Just as the music was flooding the charts, the business of radio was going through a radical reorganization. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 cleared the way for corporations to own and manage multiple stations in a market. That change not only drove up the prices of FM stations, but it resulted in big companies like Viacom, which now owns Infinity, and through it, WXRK and WBCN, and Clear Channel which controls several stations in cities like Boston, New York and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Such cluster ownership at first provided a spur for the new format, as group owners sought ways to remove internal competition. ''Companies didn't need three Top 40 stations someplace like Omaha, so they took one and tried the new alternative format,'' said Daniel Behring, the program director of WFNX.</p>
        <p>Such experimentation was short-lived. Higher station prices raised the ante for profitability. And compared with the smaller pioneer stations, the 50,000-watt powerhouses new to the format needed much higher ratings and advertising billings.</p>
        <p>''When you pay $75 million for a good-size FM, you're going to program it in a way that brings you back the best return on your investment,'' said Paul Heine, executive editor of the Friday Morning Quarterback group of media trade publications.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kingston of K-Rock agrees. ''The landscape changed,'' he said. ''You need to be more of a specialist.''</p>
        <p>Because women are seen as more likely to switch to pop stations -- particularly the increasingly trendy adult-contemporary stations, which specialize in melodic pop artists like Sheryl Crow and Bonnie Raitt -- men became the most readily accessible rock demographic. And most of the formerly free-wheeling alternative stations pursued them with a harder-sounding, more tightly formatted playlist.</p>
        <p>''Most of the alternative stations have gone decidedly male,'' Mr. Kingston said. ''They're playing Metallica and Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach.''</p>
        <p>And what remains of the old alternative in today's modern format is the focus on new material.</p>
        <p>''Stations are much more current-music focused than the old A.O.R. stations,'' said Mr. Behring, referring to album-oriented rock. He worked at the old-style rock station  WSAQ in San Antonio before arriving in Boston in November 1997. ''We were less than 25 percent current,'' he said, referring to the Texas station. Now, in Boston, ''a station like ours -- or K-Rock or 99X in Atlanta -- is 75 or 80 percent current.''</p>
        <p>That quest for the new may keep the modern format from losing more of its identity, said Jim McGuinn of WPLY in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>''Right now, there's a preponderance of heavy music,'' Mr. McGuinn said. ''But it's too early to tell if this is a paradigm shift, like grunge was, or if this is a trend and there'll be a reaction against it.''</p>
