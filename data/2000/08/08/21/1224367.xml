        <p>When they were growing up in Southern California as junior golfers, Bob May set records that Tiger Woods would break.</p>
        <p>''When we were juniors,'' May recalled, ''I was 16 and he was 9, so he was still playing nine holes and I was playing full rounds. But later on, in some newspaper articles he would say, 'I'm going to beat Bob May's record,' which he pretty much proceeded to do. He kept on saying it and doing it, so I was hoping maybe I could get a chance to get back at him.''</p>

        <p>When they were growing up in Southern California as junior golfers, Bob May set records that Tiger Woods would break.</p>
        <p>''When we were juniors,'' May recalled, ''I was 16 and he was 9, so he was still playing nine holes and I was playing full rounds. But later on, in some newspaper articles he would say, 'I'm going to beat Bob May's record,' which he pretty much proceeded to do. He kept on saying it and doing it, so I was hoping maybe I could get a chance to get back at him.''</p>
        <p>May got that chance in today's final round of the 82nd Professional Golfers' Association Championship, and he almost did get back at Woods.</p>
        <p>With a desperate 15-foot birdie putt from the fringe of the 18th green for a third consecutive 66 to Woods's 67, the 31-year-old May forced a three-hole playoff that Woods eventually won with a bunker shot within a foot on the same 18th hole, the final playoff hole.</p>
        <p>''When it ended,'' May said, ''Tiger told me: 'It was a great match. You played incredible.' ''</p>
        <p>May, who earned a total of more than $700,000 in previous PGA Tour and European Tour events this year, played the round of his life against the world's No. 1-ranked player in one of the most dramatic duels in a major golf tournament.</p>
        <p>In earning $540,000 as the runner-up with a record-sharing 18-under-par total for 72 holes, May at least fulfilled his own expectations as someone who could contend for a major title.</p>
        <p>''You might say that if I shot maybe 62 today and three 72's, it was kind of a fluke,'' he said. ''But I shot 72 the first day and then three rounds of 66 on a pretty good golf course. So I don't think there is any fluke involved in that.</p>
        <p>''If I had won, it would have been a dream come true. Not only to win a major, but to beat -- well, we can't say Tiger is the best ever to play, it wouldn't be fair to a lot of other players, but when he is done, he may be the best player.''</p>
        <p>May trailed Woods by one shot after 54 holes. In the tension of being in contention in a major tournament for the first time, he had a strange night of sleep.</p>
        <p>''I never played so much golf in my sleep,'' he said. ''I mean, I slept great until the alarm clock went off, but all I was doing was playing these holes in my sleep. I was like, wow, I'd play that hole again and I'd wake up -- well, not really wake up, just kind of turn over. It was weird. But I never played a hole out. I just kept on seeing holes, but I never hit a shot.''</p>
        <p>He hit shots today -- shots that had the gallery rooting for him as the underdog. When he birdied the 535-yard second hole as Woods bogeyed, May suddenly led by a stroke.</p>
        <p>''I think they started rooting for me then,'' May said. ''I think they thought, 'This is going to be a little interesting.' And they seemed to root for me all day. It's tough out there. I turned to Tiger and said, 'Is this what you get every week?' and he said, 'You got it.'</p>
        <p>''I could see how he can be a little irritable at times, and people think he's not being kind to people. But it is tough when you get that four or five and a half hours a day. But it's great to have fans. Fans make the golf tournament.''</p>
        <p>May's home is in Las Vegas with his wife, Brenda, and their son, Trenton.</p>
        <p>''The reason my wife wasn't here,'' he said, ''is that she's due with our second child in four and a half weeks, maybe five weeks. The doctor doesn't let her fly anymore. But my parents were here, and I had several other friends come in to support me. I probably had a dozen people I knew personally who came from all over the country to support me.''</p>
        <p>He was not counting Tiger Woods.</p>
