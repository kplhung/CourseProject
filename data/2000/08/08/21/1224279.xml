        <p>UNTIL recently, it was obvious which prominent Irwin Jacobs was the business executive exemplar of the new economy. That would be Irwin M. Jacobs, the computer scientist and electrical engineer who founded Qualcomm in San Diego in 1985. He built it into a thriving Fortune 500 company through pioneering innovations in cellular communications.</p>
        <p>The other Irwin Jacobs, Irwin L. Jacobs, is an irrepressible deal maker and bargain hunter based in Minneapolis. He became wealthy by taking big stakes in Fortune 500 conglomerates in the 1970's and 1980's, usually with the goal of unlocking value by breaking them up.</p>
        <p>New technology was never high on Irwin L.'s list of fascinations. His idea of an electronics venture was to sell surplus and returned consumer electronics devices obtained from big retailers through the Jacobs Trading Company. His effort to sell such goods directly to consumers over the Web (wgdeal.com, for ''world's greatest deal'') was a bust. The only major business he retains from his days as a corporate raider -- Genmar Holdings, the nation's second-largest leisure boat manufacturer -- is in a labor-intensive segment of the economy that has been among the slowest to invest in new technology.</p>
        <p>Irwin L.'s image may get a cybersheen at the end of this month, though. That is when  Genmar plans to hold an open house at its Little Falls, Minn., factory to show off a compact, enclosed computer-controlled manufacturing system that can be remotely operated over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Visitors will see 18-foot hulls, which used to take eight hours to produce, pop out every 35 minutes. Pollution, waste and labor will be sharply reduced, while quality will be so much higher that Genmar is offering a lifetime guarantee instead of the industry standard of five years. Genmar says the total cost is comparable to that for boats made by conventional techniques -- and should become lower over time.</p>
        <p>Time Magazine, given a preview tour and a sales pitch on how the system could be adapted to many other products, called it ''the revolution in a box'' and suggested it could make large centralized factories ''obsolete.'' Bruce Bobbins, Mr. Jacob's publicist, calls the process, known as virtual engineered composite, or V.E.C., ''the most important manufacturing revolution in the past half century'' and says that Genmar has been inundated with inquiries from other manufacturers, including producers of cars, household products and construction materials.</p>
        <p>The technology was invented by Gene Kirila II and Robert McCollum, two Pennsylvanians who envision scattering leased VEC manufacturing cells around the world that would produce a variety of products close to where they would be used. The expertise to run the systems could reside at a central control center thanks to the Internet, so that workers at the production sites would not need extensive training.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs was so impressed with how well the virtual engineered composite process had fitted Genmar's needs that he bought Pyramid Operating Systems, the company Mr. Kirila and Mr. McCollum created in 1993 to develop VEC. Genmar's  control room is hundreds of miles from Little Falls, in Greenville, Pa., where Mr. Kirila, Mr. McCollum and an expanding team of engineers are searching for new VEC applications.</p>
        <p>Manufacturing experts say Mr. Jacobs would be justified in bragging about the process at any high-technology gathering. That does not mean that other manufacturers will jump at Mr. Jacobs's offer to sell them access to the technology. Their reaction matters because Mr. Jacobs is counting on more than stronger sales at Genmar to justify the $30 million he has invested in VEC so far. Interest in VEC could provide the fuel for taking Genmar public, a move Mr. Jacobs has talked about for years.</p>
        <p>But like a 20-something Silicon Valley entrepreneur with the latest Web-based strategy for going from zero to millionaire in a matter of weeks, Mr. Jacobs and other backers of his technology face the temptation to oversell VEC's future. In addition to underestimating the costs and risks other manufacturers could encounter in moving to their new technology, proponents of the process, like true believers in any new technology, are probably underestimating the strengths and potential of competing technologies.</p>
        <p>No wonder, as the history of robotics, machine vision and other innovations shows, computer-based technology generally seeps, rather than bursts, into manufacturing. The bigger the manufacturing sector the more cautious are managers to replace proven, if less than perfect, technologies and materials with new approaches. There is no particular reason to believe that any of VEC's attributes, including its ability to be controlled by remote experts via the Internet, will change that.</p>
        <p>''We have to make numbers every quarter,'' said Paul Dickard, a spokesman for Ingersoll-Rand, which has been experimenting with VEC for several years. ''There's always the question of which quarter you are going to sacrifice on the altar of Internet-enabled manufacturing.''</p>
        <p>Internet capability is central to the vision of virtual-engineered-composite manufacturing ''cells,'' as the company calls its systems, serving as remote minifactories that could be set up and running within days. But that innovation, already available in different forms on other computerized manufacturing equipment, is only part of what makes VEC a unique package. The other key element, developed to keep costs down, is the use of laminated plastic skins instead of metal as the molding frames.</p>
        <p>The skins are attached to supports inside the VEC cell and composite resins are injected between them. To give the skins the rigidity that metal would usually provide,  Mr. Kirila and Mr. McCollum hit upon the elegantly simple idea of water pressure. Before the molding compounds are injected, the cell is sealed and the cavities behind the skins are filled with water.</p>
        <p>Computers monitor the numerous variables in this ''floating mold'' process -- there are roughly 800 in the hull-making operation -- so that relatively unskilled laborers can handle all of the necessary work  at the actual manufacturing site.</p>
        <p>VEC is clearly innovative enough to attract many window shoppers, but the chances that it will lead to the wide dispersal in manufacturing that its inventors envision are slim. Plastics manufacturing experts say Mr. Jacobs is likely to have his hands full simply establishing the process as a reliable system in a few segments of industry best suited to it.</p>
        <p>Those segments include fabricators like Genmar that use fiberglass and other plastic composites, face environmental restrictions and have high labor turnover because of the health risks and discomforts associated with current working conditions. Potential sites will also have lower volumes than the typical auto plant and less need for precision than, say, aircraft manufacturers. Logical candidates include other marine products like jet skis as well as bathtubs and paneling for buildings, trucks, rail cars or specialty vehicles.</p>
        <p>''It's suited for about half the volume of the plastics composites industry,'' estimates Robert Locavara, director of technical affairs for the Composite Fabricators Association, a trade group for companies that make industrial components and consumer products out of fiberglass and other plastic composites.</p>
        <p>That could add up to billions of dollars of production, but one thing is for sure: even if it comes to pass, it will not happen at Internet speed.</p>
