        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani rejected the advice of the departing police commissioner and the wishes of much of the rest of the department hierarchy. But the leadership team he installed in the city's highest profile  agency makes perfect sense, if viewed through the mayor's prism.</p>
        <p>The new police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, is someone the mayor trusts, and whose loyalty, like that of the departing police commissioner Howard Safir, he need not question. The mayor expects that Mr. Kerik, who brought order to the once-chaotic city jails, will move with alacrity to tighten the Police Department's financial management.</p>
        <p>Joseph P. Dunne, the 31-year department veteran whom Mr. Safir backed and who many had predicted would get the top job, is now first deputy commissioner, the department's second in command. He can use the relationships he has established with rank-and-file officers and the department's top brass, as well as his rapport with some of the city's minority leaders, to help Mr. Kerik pursue his goals.</p>
        <p>And at City Hall, the mayor keeps at his side the third finalist for the commissioner job, Dennison Young Jr., one of his closest and most trusted aides. Since the administration began, Mr. Young has helped coordinate law enforcement matters, and keeping him there effectively ensures the mayor can maintain his supreme command over a department whose crime-reduction campaign has so defined his tenure.</p>
        <p>In theory, the arrangement mixes the best skills of each, assuming the team can work together for the 16 remaining months the mayor has in office. ''The city is going to have the good fortune of having all three of them working together,'' the mayor said on Saturday. ''It's a wonderful team.''</p>
        <p>The mayor showed obvious pleasure at his decision. But as he articulated his choice on Saturday, it became clear that the effusive praise he had offered Mr. Safir -- repeatedly calling him the city's greatest police commissioner -- might have been too generous. If not, why then would the mayor appoint a new commissioner who has implied he wants to curtail overtime spending, make Police Department managers more accountable and improve department morale, while also pushing to ease tension between the department and ethnic groups?</p>
        <p>The community relations campaign got under way yesterday morning, as Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Kerik and Mr. Dunne together went to the Greater Bright Light Baptist Church in Brooklyn for the Sunday service at the predominantly black church.</p>
        <p>''We want the department to reach out more, and we want the people of the city to understand that we expect from them that they are going to respect the police more,'' Mr. Giuliani said yesterday.</p>
        <p>By passing over Mr. Dunne, 52, who as chief of the department had been the top uniformed officer in the 41,000-person force, the mayor demonstrated his concern that a man who had spent his entire career within the department might be too caught up in the traditional ways and too closely allied with his department colleagues. For the mayor, these questions of loyalties are particularly important now, as his administration presses the Police Department unions to accept money-saving changes in personnel rules and to switch to a merit-based system of pay raises. The department's largest union is resisting such changes.</p>
        <p>''I am sure most New Yorkers will agree that New York City's police officers have been productive and we will leave the rest of the negotiations to the bargaining table,'' said Joseph Mancini, a spokesman for the 27,000-member Patrolman's Benevolent Association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik, 44, and Mr. Giuliani first met when Mr. Kerik worked as a city narcotics detective and Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, was making his first run for mayor. Mr. Kerik coordinated Mr. Giuliani's security detail on weekends during his second campaign, and shortly after the mayor went into office in 1994, Mr. Kerik became the first deputy commissioner at the Department of Correction.</p>
        <p>His success in reshaping that troubled department -- where inmate stabbings and violence against officers had surged -- is largely what earned him his new job. Mr. Kerik, who became correction commissioner in January 1998, shares the mayor's obsession for numbers. He applied this data-driven approach to correction, measuring employee performance on more than 130 statistical yardsticks, from inmate violence to officer overtime and sick time and the speed at which broken equipment was repaired.</p>
        <p>Commissioner Kerik was able to get more out of correction workers and ''at the same time build their morale by holding them accountable,'' the mayor said yesterday. ''That is the sign of a truly effective leader, in the modern day in which you have to accomplish all of those things.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik clearly intends to take some of his same management techniques to the Police Department. ''It'll give you a way to get to see every little bit of the agency, every area where you may be lacking,'' Mr. Kerik said on Saturday.</p>
        <p>But some city officials and former police administrators question how effective the commissioner will be at accomplishing these goals. He  served as a city police officer for only eight years before leaving for the Department of Correction, and his quick rise to the top of the nation's largest police department may result in some resentment.</p>
        <p>''There are hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of supervisors or commanders in the Police Department who have seniority to him,'' said City Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, a Democrat from Queens, who is chairman of the Public Safety Committee. ''That has often made it difficult for someone assuming command to get people under him to follow his policies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik is also known to be temperamental, and his willingness to demote and replace subordinates who do not live up to his expectations may heighten resistance. Mr. Kerik comes out of a department where the customers are under lock and key. He will suddenly be serving the city at large, running an agency that has four times as many employees. And Mr. Kerik, who does not have a college degree, is now leading an agency that wants its rank-and-file officers to have college experience.</p>
        <p>''It is O.K. to be the commissioner without college, but you can't be a cop without college,'' said Rafael Collazo, first vice president of the Latino Officers Association, which represents some correction officers and police officers. ''It is outrageous. If we are holding out a standard for police, it should start from the top.''</p>
        <p>Finally, by not naming Mr. Dunne, who earned a high degree of respect from black leaders in the city when he was a Brooklyn precinct commander, the mayor has already inspired some criticism that he is not adequately committed to repairing the relationship between the police and minorities, which has suffered following recent shootings of unarmed black men.</p>
        <p>''I don't know that the mayor felt there was a need to build bridges,'' said Councilwoman Annette Robinson, a Brooklyn Democrat who is black. ''Joe Dunne could have done that. I am saddened that he was not give that chance.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani yesterday rejected the criticism, which was echoed by the Rev. Al Sharpton.</p>
        <p>''You can't win with some people,'' the mayor said, laughing. ''We're doing everything we can to reach out. There are some people that make their reputations and money on criticizing the Police Department. You are never going to please them.''</p>
