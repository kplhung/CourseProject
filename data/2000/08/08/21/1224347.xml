        <p>Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' leadoff batter, may be within a week of returning to the team. He threw from 90 feet yesterday, taking ground balls and making throws from second base to first, and took batting practice.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch is recovering from tendinitis in his right elbow, and if he does not have any setbacks in the next few days, he could begin a minor league rehabilitation stint toward the end of the week. Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said there was a ''real possibility'' that Knoblauch could rejoin the Yankees before Sept. 1.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch has not played since Aug.  2, and the Yankees have missed his presence at the top of their lineup, his ability to elevate pitch counts and to create offense. Knoblauch's elbow trouble did not prevent him from hitting before he was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his career; it did cause deep pain when he threw.</p>
        <p>By waiting until Sept. 1 to activate Knoblauch, the Yankees could avoid making a roster decision to make room for him, because all major league rosters expand on that date. But the Yankees have failed to increase their lead over the Boston Red Sox recently, and each of their remaining 42 games are taking on increased importance; they will need Knoblauch as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>The most vulnerable player on the 25-man roster would appear to be outfielder Luis Polonia, who has not performed well since joining the Yankees and does not have a clear-cut role now that the roster is stocked with David Justice, Glenallen Hill and Jose Canseco.</p>
        <p>Ramiro Mendoza, the right-hander who is on the disabled list because of weakness in the back of his right shoulder, will begin a throwing program today as he works his way back to the active roster. Mendoza's status is crucial to the makeup of the Yankees' bullpen, because he has been so useful in the postseason in recent years. The Yankees hope Mendoza will be back in early to mid-September, to give him enough appearances to establish his command before October.</p>
        <p>Celebrating No. 16</p>
        <p>Whitey Ford joked that he had never been so nervous since he faced Ted Williams for the first time. The occasion was Whitey Ford Day at Yankee Stadium and the No. 16 was painted near the first- and third-base foul lines -- Ford's number, the only Yankees number retired in honor of a pitcher. Ford, a left-hander who won 236 regular-season games and 10 more in the World Series, was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974.</p>
        <p>About a dozen former teammates were on hand, including Yogi Berra, Phil Rizzuto and Luis Arroyo. Ford mentioned his late son Tom in thanking his family, his voice clutched by emotion. ''I've had some wonderful days here,'' he said. ''But this tops them all.''</p>
        <p>Ford continued, ''I've been a Yankee for 53 years, and I'll be a Yankee forever.''</p>
        <p>Ford, 71, finished radiation treatments he had been undergoing after the removal of a cancerous brain tumor last November. Ford, who went through a similar procedure five years ago, has said he is feeling a lot better. Yesterday, he smiled on the field and laughed and appeared to wipe away a few tears. ''I'm so overwhelmed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Not to Worry</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams, the Yankees' center fielder, was out of the lineup for the second consecutive game because of a twinge in his right side. He initially felt the pain while taking batting practice before Saturday's game. ''I feel better today,'' Williams said before yesterday's game.</p>
        <p>Williams has had a rib-cage injury before and said that his pain is nowhere close to what it was the last time he was hurt. ''I'm not really worried about it,'' he said. ''But I'd rather be out there playing.''</p>
        <p>Beyond the fact that the Yankees need him as they prepare for the final 42 games of the season, Williams has reasons of his own to return as soon as possible. He is considered one of the American League's top candidates for the Most Valuable Player award, and with 107 runs batted in he is 23 short of the single-season record for switch-hitters, established by Mickey Mantle in 1956 and later tied by Ken Caminiti.</p>
        <p>Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher, was also out of the starting lineup and did not participate in batting practice, taking a full day off from his regular pregame work to rest. During his last at-bat Saturday, Posada tore a fingernail while batting, stepping out of the batter's box to flex and test his hand at one point. Posada pinch-hit in the ninth inning yesterday, grounding out, and he expects to be back in the lineup this afternoon when the Yankees play the Texas Rangers. Darin Erstad, Anaheim's most valuable player candidate, also missed Sunday's game because of a rib-cage problem.</p>
        <p>Feeling Better</p>
        <p>David Cone struck out the first two batters in the first inning yesterday, Orlando Palmeiro and Scott Speizio, and when the count reached full on the first baseman Mo Vaughn, the Yankee Stadium crowd began clapping and cheering.</p>
        <p>Standing on the mound, Cone looked around for an instant, as if to feed off their emotion, and he finished off Vaughn with a split-fingered fastball, the third of his six strikeouts on the afternoon. Cone's confidence, hurt by his long winless streak, seems to be returning.</p>
        <p>There were times when Cone made vague references to the end of his career during his slump, but he is beyond that now. His record is 3-10. But he said that anyone who really believed he had pitched like a 3-10 pitcher this season had not been paying attention. ''I've been better than 3-10,'' he said, a reference to the games when he has pitched well enough to win but has not done so. ''I just feel good about what I'm doing.''</p>
        <p>Over his last four starts, Cone has compiled a 2.74 earned run average, allowing 7 earned runs in 23 innings in winning both of his decisions.</p>
