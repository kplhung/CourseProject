        <p>One by one, disappointed players came off the course, knowing the year's final opportunity to win a major championship had passed them by.</p>
        <p>Ernie Els, who finished second in the year's first three majors, finished well back in the field at three under par. At least he didn't have to deal with another second-place finish, but he was hoping to finally finish first.</p>
        <p>''The last two days, I totally lost it with my putting stroke,'' said Els, the world's No. 2-ranked player and a two-time United States Open winner. ''I don't believe I have ever putted as bad in all my life. I missed everything and had a terrible time on the greens. It's a bit disappointing.</p>
        <p>''I have been playing well this year. It's obviously very disappointing to play like this. All in all, I have to look at my year, and I played very well. I've had a good time. I could have done better here and there, but I can't complain.''</p>
        <p>Phil Mickelson and Davis Love III tied for ninth place at nine under par, but both players faded over the weekend when they had a chance to win.</p>
        <p>''I am certainly disappointed,'' said Mickelson, at age 30 looking for his first major championship. ''I would have loved to have won here at Valhalla. It's a course I felt very comfortable on. I felt like I had been playing well this year and would have loved to have won a major.''</p>
        <p>Still Going Strong</p>
        <p>At 50 years old, Tom Watson shot 68 to finish nine under par for the tournament, good enough to tie for ninth place.</p>
        <p>''I'm very happy with the way I played and the way I competed,'' Watson said. ''After not really striking the ball well yesterday, I was a little bit tentative about how I was going to hit the ball today. I changed something on the practice range today and it worked. After the first couple of holes, I was very confident with what I was doing as far as my golf swing was concerned. After a start of 76, it wasn't a bad tournament.''</p>
        <p>No Surprise</p>
        <p>Phil Mickelson, who knows Bob May well, was not surprised by May's performance.</p>
        <p>''When the average fan looks at Bob May, they just see a good young player,'' Mickelson said. ''When I was growing up in San Diego, Bob May dominated. He was a couple of years older than I was, and he won every Southern California PGA junior championship there was. He qualified for the L.A. Open when he was 15 or 16 years old, and he has been a top, top player at every level of the game. It's just taken him a little while to get out on the PGA Tour and to win. He is a very tough competitor. He was one of the most difficult guys to beat head to head as a junior.''</p>
        <p>Begay and Cink Join Team</p>
        <p>Notah Begay and Stewart Cink won the tournament within the tournament by qualifying for the Presidents Cup in October. The event was the last chance for a handful of players to compile enough points, based on earnings, to make the 12-member team, and Begay and Cink earned the final two automatic bids available.
