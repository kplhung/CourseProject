        <p>In the light mist that suffuses the black-box stage of the Clark Studio Theater at Lincoln Center, the Aquila Theater Company's production of ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' begins with an engaging series of directorial ideas. Actors enter and begin building a makeshift theater out of rudimentary props: a platform on a pushcart, a closet-size proscenium with light drapes for a curtain.</p>
        <p>Collapsed umbrella skeletons, lonely-looking on the floor, are raised high by a pulley, their arms spreading, tiny lights along them illuminated: Voila! Chandeliers! And the babbling Parisians who arrive for a theater performance in the opening scene of Rostand's comic melodrama are portrayed by a shuffling scrum of actors holding puppets, the frivolous repartee traded among the animators and the animated.</p>
        <p>The clear message is that this is to be a conceptual ''Cyrano,'' the vision of Robert Richmond, associate artistic director of the Aquila, a nine-year-old, half-British, half-American touring company based in London and New York. Mr. Richmond, who also directed the company's ''Comedy of Errors'' that was enthusiastically received in New York this summer (I didn't see it), has adapted the script as well as directed this production, and he sets a high standard for charm and invention in his opening sequence, which has a precociously witty feel.</p>
        <p>Unhappily, it is only intermittently matched thereafter, as the tether of the auteur tightens around the collar of the production, and both actors and script are held in thrall to an inconsistent welter of ideas.</p>
        <p>Written in the late 19th century and set in the 17th, ''Cyrano'' is of course the defining parable of the appearance-versus-character question, the story of the world's most competent, honorable and manly man whose gifts and accomplishments are dwarfed only by his nose, the shame of which keeps him from declaring love for the beautiful Roxanne, makes him defensive and bitter, and consigns him to a martyr's loneliness. With its gloriously highfalutin speechifying, its unabashedly outsize passions and its elbow-in-the-ribs spirit, it has always been attractively ripe for interpretation.</p>
        <p>The problem here is that Mr. Richmond doesn't seem to have settled on a tone for the show, which waffles among broad farce, anachronistic sitcomesque jokiness and, particularly in the soliloquies of Cyrano himself (Anthony Cochrane), straightforwardly formal melodrama. His script adaptation mixes modern colloquialisms and occasional vulgarity -- Cyrano's colleagues, the Gascon guards, are prone to flatulence jokes and flourishing their middle fingers -- with Rostand's more sophisticated tongue-in-cheekiness, an undermining flirtation with sophomoric baseness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richmond does create a handful of effective tableaux -- as in the famous scene in which Cyrano, speaking for handsome but inarticulate Christian (Alvero Heinig), woos Roxanne (Lisa Carter) beneath her window -- in which the actors are positioned to play to the audience rather than one another, a simple idea that pays dividends to the performers, connecting them to their characters in a way that Mr. Richmond's more heavy-handed tricks do not. His swordplay scenes, in slow motion, replete with smoke and effusive lighting, are merely grandiose.</p>
        <p>In sum there's a showoffy quality to this production: independent scenes informed by separate ideas (Hey, watch this!) rather than a firm grip on the play as a whole. But Mr. Richmond's reins are tightly held throughout, and the actors are victimized by his sacrifice of sustained wit for mere jokes.</p>
        <p>The supporting players particularly appear to be roped firmly into broad comic performances their gifts don't support Sean Fri, as De Guiche, the privileged military officer who has designs on Roxanne, and Mr. Heinig (who plays the fop humiliated by Cyrano's eloquent recitation of nose jokes, as well as Christian) overplay the wimpy card with conventional mugging.</p>
        <p>Most egregiously, Jenny Israel, as Roxanne's maid, for some reason employs the overexcited accent of a Southern yahoo, as if she reported to work from the set of ''The Andy Griffith Show.'' Even Ms. Carter, who, as Roxanne, is poised when in serious mode (despite a hoop dress that consists of only barrel staves and exposes her undies), becomes frivolously cartoonish when Mr. Richmond unnecessarily wants her shallow attraction to Christian underscored.</p>
        <p>At the center of the play Mr. Cochrane gives a game performance here; his verbal aptitude for Cyrano's eloquence is apparent (a Scot, he has the voice and accent for it) and shows himself capable of both the seriousness of Cyrano's torment and the glibness of a Seinfeld. But the nature of the production has him shuttling back and forth between impulses, as though he's changing masks; in his several long speeches he does a lot of pacing, which feels less like a character's nervous release of energy than an actor's desperate search for a center.</p>
        <p>At Thursday's performance Mr. Cochrane had the added burden of keeping his makeup glued on. His nose fell off twice before he finally put it in his coat and finished the play without it. He provided one glitteringly timed ad-lib, patting his pocket when he would otherwise have pointed to his face, but otherwise his performance was improved for his not having to worry about it. Cyrano's nose was better off in his head, not on it. Like a lot of obvious elements in this production, it was only calling attention to itself.</p>
