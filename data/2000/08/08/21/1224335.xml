        <p>Leo Hernandez had not been planning to wake up at 5:30 this morning to go to work. Old-timers at the phone company had told him that if a strike lasted more than two weeks, it would be a long one. Mr. Hernandez had been preparing to wait it out.</p>
        <p>But an agreement reached yesterday, as the walkout entered its third week, meant the end of picket lines and paycheck worries for about two-thirds of the more than 86,000 Verizon Communications workers on strike in 12 states and Washington. And it meant hope for thousands of customers stranded without service.</p>
        <p>''I'm very happy,'' said Mr. Hernandez, a switchman at the Manhattan headquarters who has worked for the company for five years. Though he did not know the details of the agreement between Verizon and two unions, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, he said he was certain any settlement would address his main concerns.</p>
        <p>Among them were the company's ability to organize workers in the wireless division and management's ability to transfer jobs, which are both addressed in the agreement.</p>
        <p>''I am confident that at least the people from my local that I know personally did a good job representing us,'' Mr. Hernandez said.</p>
        <p>In the lobby of the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel in Washington, leaders of the unions said they had accomplished much of what they had sought to achieve when they went on strike.</p>
        <p>''We reached a fair agreement and everybody's happy,'' Angel Feliciano, a leader of Local 1101 of the Communications Workers of America, said.</p>
        <p>Asked what the union had won in the contracts, James P. O'Hare, president of Local 1118, which is in Albany, replied: ''Stock options are nice, but the major goals are transfering our work, protections against contracts, no layoffs, no downgrades. You can't beat that.''</p>
        <p>Several Verizon workers said they were prepared to face the backlog of repairs and other jobs that had piled up in their absence. ''We're not afraid of hard work,'' said Annie B. Bowie, a 30-year veteran, as she volunteered at CWA Local 1101 in Manhattan last night, preparing checks for union members who had done picket line duty. ''For a good day's wage, we will give a good day's work.''</p>
        <p>Though forced overtime was one of the complaints the unions brought to the bargaining table, a local union president in Boston said overtime restrictions would be rolled back this week to allow technicians to chip away at the accumulated work requests.</p>
        <p>''For many of them, especially the younger ones with children, it's good money for them,'' said the official, Edward T. Fitzpatrick of I.B.E.W. local No. 2222.</p>
        <p>Verizon customers said they were relieved that the strike was over, but somewhat skeptical that an end to their wait for service would soon follow. Rachel Karr, the office manager for Digital Club Network in Manhattan, said that because of a delay in installing digital phone lines, she had been able to provide only 8 phone lines for more than 60 employees.</p>
        <p>When told that the strike had ended, she said, ''They were late before they went on strike, so I'm not happy until everything's done. Maybe they'll answer the phones now, though.''</p>
        <p>Heidi Bullinga, an architect, said she had been without phone, fax, or e-mail service since she moved into a new office in SoHo last week.</p>
        <p>''It's actually a very lonely, disconnected feeling, when you can't do business or get in touch with anyone,'' Ms. Bullinga said.</p>
