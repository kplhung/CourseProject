        <p>There were three talking points as the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals reached their conclusion here today. One was the participation in the Mixed Teams of Bill Gates, Chairman of Microsoft and a bridge enthusiast. Teamed with him, and qualifying for today's final sessions, were Sharon Osberg of San Francisco, Howard Weinstein of Chicago and Sheri Winestock of Toronto. Gates, who plays bridge frequently online, was expecting to be teamed here with Warren E. Buffett; but Mr. Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, is recovering from surgery.</p>
        <p>The second talking point was the Women's Knockout Team victory on Friday night of Kathie Wei-Sender of Nashville; Betty Ann Kennedy of Shreveport, La.; Jill Levin of Riverdale, the Bronx; Juanita Chambers of Walpole, Mass.; Janice Seamon-Molson of Miami; and Tobi Sokolow of Austin, Tex. They won the final by 44 imps against a Texas squad that will represent the United States in the world championships in the Netherlands next week.</p>

        <p>There were three talking points as the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals reached their conclusion here today. One was the participation in the Mixed Teams of Bill Gates, Chairman of Microsoft and a bridge enthusiast. Teamed with him, and qualifying for today's final sessions, were Sharon Osberg of San Francisco, Howard Weinstein of Chicago and Sheri Winestock of Toronto. Gates, who plays bridge frequently online, was expecting to be teamed here with Warren E. Buffett; but Mr. Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, is recovering from surgery.</p>
        <p>The second talking point was the Women's Knockout Team victory on Friday night of Kathie Wei-Sender of Nashville; Betty Ann Kennedy of Shreveport, La.; Jill Levin of Riverdale, the Bronx; Juanita Chambers of Walpole, Mass.; Janice Seamon-Molson of Miami; and Tobi Sokolow of Austin, Tex. They won the final by 44 imps against a Texas squad that will represent the United States in the world championships in the Netherlands next week.</p>
        <p>The third talking point was the performance in the Spingold Knockout Teams of Roy Welland and Brad Moss, both of Manhattan, Marc Jacobus of Las Vegas, Fred Gitelman of Toronto and Magnus Lindqvist and Peter Fredin, both of Sweden. They followed upset victories over powerful squads led by Nick Nickell of Manhattan and Richard Schwartz of East Elmhurst, Queens, by defeating George Jacobs of Hinsdale, Ill., and his team by 13 imps in Saturday's semifinal.</p>
        <p>In the other semifinal, Rose Meltzer and Peter Weichsel, both of Los Gatos, Calif.; Alan Sontag of Manahattan; Kyle Larsen of San Francisco; Chip Martel of Davis, Calif.; and Lew Stansby of Castro Valley, Calif., trailed early but recovered to win by the same margin of 13 against a foursome led by Steve Robinson of Arlington, Va.</p>
        <p>The defending Spingold Champions, and reigning world champions, were Nickell; Dick Freeman of Atlanta; Bob Hamman of Dallas; Paul Soloway of Mill Creek, Wash.; Eric Rodwell of Naperville, Ill.; and Jeff Meckstroth of Tampa, Fla. Their loss on Thursday to the Welland team, only their second defeat in 52 Spingold matches, was the talk of the tournament. A key deal, shown in the diagram, led Jacobus and Welland to reach a slightly optimistic seven-diamond contract.</p>
        <p>The opening bid of one no-trump showed 14-16 points. After a transfer response showing hearts, Rodwell and Meckstroth, East and West, bid up to four spades, and eventually regretted their enterprise. Welland's final bid of seven diamonds was made in the hope that his partner held the diamond queen. If that card was missing, the contract would hinge on locating it, and this proved to be the case.</p>
        <p>Welland won the spade lead in dummy, crossed to the diamond ace and led to the heart ace. He then led a trump and thought matters over when the 10 appeared on his right. It was most unlikely that East-West would bid to the four-level without some distributional values, so he finessed the jack and was rewarded when the grand slam came home.</p>
        <p>This proved to be a gain of 10 imps to the Welland team and might have been more. In the replay the contract was six hearts, and the bad trump split made it necessary for the declarer to make a winning guess in diamonds, which he did.</p>
