        <p>Comparing his increasingly populist pitch to that of Harry S. Truman, but leaving the ''give-'em-hell'' to his running mate, Vice President Al Gore renewed his attacks on drug companies and health maintenance organizations today and vowed to bring broader and fairer health coverage to all Americans.</p>
        <p>At the first of four appearances today in Illinois and Iowa, all of them in communities along the Mississippi River, Mr. Gore said he would push for a patients' bill of rights to protect H.M.O. consumers and for adding a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program.</p>

        <p>Comparing his increasingly populist pitch to that of Harry S. Truman, but leaving the ''give-'em-hell'' to his running mate, Vice President Al Gore renewed his attacks on drug companies and health maintenance organizations today and vowed to bring broader and fairer health coverage to all Americans.</p>
        <p>At the first of four appearances today in Illinois and Iowa, all of them in communities along the Mississippi River, Mr. Gore said he would push for a patients' bill of rights to protect H.M.O. consumers and for adding a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program.</p>
        <p>''If you entrust me with the presidency, we will flat make it happen,'' Mr. Gore promised a crowd of about 3,000 in downtown Moline.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, used their speeches here to draw on the Trumanesque imagery that has enthralled Democrats for more than half a century. But Mr. Gore left it to Mr. Lieberman to assail the health care record of Mr. Gore's Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gore made only passing references to the Republicans, Mr. Lieberman cited statistics that 1.4 million children in Texas did not have health insurance, that Texas led the nation in the percentage of residents who were uninsured and that it ranked next to last in health care coverage for women.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said Mr. Bush often responded to criticism of his state by saying, ''Don't mess with Texas.'' But, he asserted, ''when it comes to health care, it's a mess in Texas.''</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Bush accused the Gore campaign today of distorting the governor's health care record, pointing out that a bill he signed in 1999 was expected to add 423,000 children to the health insurance rolls by 2001. (Mr. Bush, however, had earlier fought for a less-inclusive plan.)</p>
        <p>''The further Al Gore floats down the Mississippi, the more he drifts away from the facts on Governor Bush's record on health care in Texas,'' said Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman.</p>
        <p>After a two-day riverboat tour down the Mississippi, Mr. Gore left the slow-moving ship and traveled by bus today so he could make all four cities on his schedule. Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper, were rejoined by Mr. Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, who had left the tour in Wisconsin on Friday to observe the Jewish Sabbath.</p>
        <p>The candidates clearly have been buoyed by polls showing they received a significant boost from the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, and they have been received enthusiastically by sizable crowds. ''I'm no expert as to what to make of it,'' Mr. Gore told reporters, ''but it feels good.''</p>
        <p>As in his speech at the convention on Thursday night, Mr. Gore accepted credit today for the economic health of the Clinton years but said there was more work to be done. He noted, for instance, that 15 percent of Americans still lacked health insurance.</p>
        <p>''We've got some serious problems in our health care system,'' he said, his voice still hoarse from his convention speech, ''and we've got to fix them without undermining the good things about our health care system.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he would move incrementally toward a system of universal health care, starting with guaranteed coverage for every child by 2004. And he said the country owes its older citizens a prescription drug benefit, a proposal estimated to cost $253 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>''When people have bills for pills that are more than their Social Security check,'' Mr. Gore said, ''it is wrong for our country to put seniors, the generation that won World War II, in a situation where they have to choose between food and medicine when the drug companies have the biggest profits of any industry in America.''</p>
        <p>The drug companies, Mr. Gore said, do not support such plans because they fear that drug prices will come down. ''Well, they need to come down,'' he said. ''They need more competition.'' He added: ''I'll be like Harry Truman. I'll tell them the truth and they'll just think it's hell.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore then switched targets from the drug companies to H.M.O.'s that he accuses of making financial decisions that usurp medical recommendations. ''Some bean counter behind a computer terminal who doesn't have a license to practice medicine and surely does not have a right to play god overrules the doctor because the H.M.O. or the insurance company doesn't want to shell out the money, even though you've been paying the monthly premium,'' Mr. Gore said. ''What is that all about?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's proposal for a patients' bill of rights, campaign aides say, would assure access to specialists, would guarantee emergency room care regardless of when and where the need arises and would provide either a right to sue or an alternative appeals process if insurers deny coverage.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign criticizes Mr. Bush's proposed bill of rights because it would cover only those Americans in federally governed health care plans, a restriction that Gore aides say would exclude 135 million people with private insurance.</p>
