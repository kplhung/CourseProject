        <p>A woman is having lunch with her grown children at an outdoor cafe when she is transfixed by the familiar tune a street-corner guitarist is playing. The children, who are pretty sure that Mom's going dotty, can't understand why she's suddenly enraptured.</p>
        <p>''If your pulse doesn't quicken when you hear Hoagy Carmichael's 'Star Dust,' then I've failed as a mother,'' the woman says with ironclad certainty.</p>
        <p>So where do you stand on the ''Star Dust'' question? Does the melody haunt your reverie? Would you like to hear it, and a pride of other pop standards, played in bracing swing-band arrangements? Do you have a tolerance, even a secret fondness, for nostalgic, life-affirming movies that bypass the head and go straight to the heart? If so, be sure to catch ''The Last of the Blond Bombshells'' tonight on HBO. Your pulse will not only quicken, it'll do the jitterbug.</p>
        <p>The woman whose children don't get it is Elizabeth, played with infectious relish by Dame Judi Dench. When first encountered, she is at a memorial service for her husband. At the sound of one of the dear departed's favorite musical selections, Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Pirate King,'' Elizabeth's mind supplies another song, ''(I'll Be Glad When You're Dead) You Rascal You,'' performed by a World War II vintage all-girl band, the Blond Bombshells.</p>
        <p>As a teenager Elizabeth was the band's tenor saxophonist, the prettiest and most talented of the young women who nightly donned platinum wigs to become the Blond Bombshells at a London ballroom. Well, almost all were young women. The drummer was a young man named Patrick who preferred drag to draft, hiding from military service in wig and gown and enjoying the embrace of all his band mates but Elizabeth.</p>
        <p>Now the new widow worries her embarrassed children by embracing life, hauling out her sax to join that outdoor guitarist for regular jam sessions. And who should happen by and catch a performance but Patrick (Ian Holm)? The young rake is now a bit bent and faded, but Sir Ian makes sure that he still has the glint in his eye and the spring, however rusty, in his step.</p>
        <p>The two gray Bombshells hit upon a plan to try to find other surviving band members to play a reunion gig. Elizabeth's wide-eyed granddaughter Joanna (Millie Findlay) offers them a job at her school dance.</p>
        <p>This warm bath of a film, directed by Gillies MacKinnon from a script by Alan Plater, glides gracefully in and out of flashbacks in which the band performs tunes like ''Opus One'' and ''A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square.'' (The sight of young Patrick in his dress will kindle a momentary memory of ''Some Like It Hot,'' but this movie dances on different turf.)</p>
        <p>Elizabeth and Patrick warm to their task and each other, finding the band's singer, Gwen (Dame Cleo Laine), performing with a jazz combo. (Dame Cleo's rendition of ''Taking a Chance on Love'' is just one of the film's musical rewards.)</p>
        <p>They find Dinah, the trumpet player (Olympia Dukakis, spewing vaudeville Brooklynese that seems to come not only from another continent but also from another movie) living in a Scottish castle with dogs named Patty, Laverne and Maxene. They find the Bombshells' leader, Betty (Joan Sims), playing piano at a seaside dive; Annie, the trombonist (June Whitfield), in a Salvation Army band; Evelyn, the alto sax player (Billie Whitelaw), in jail. And they lure Madeleine, the bass player (Leslie Caron, who still has Gigi's sparkle), from her native France. Each of these performers makes maturity look like great fun.</p>
        <p>The reconstituted band sounds ragged at first. But there's really no suspense about whether the Bombshells will find their chops and show the young listeners a trick or two. This is a fable, after all, and if the soundtrack makes the little geriatric ensemble sound better, and bigger, than the Basie band in its prime, so what?</p>
        <p>When Dame Cleo belts out ''It Don't Mean a Thing if It Ain't Got That Swing,'' there's no doubt that she has got that swing. So does this film. And that's the name of that tune.</p>
