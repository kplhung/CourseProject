        <p>A day after he proposed large tax cuts if elected senator, Representative Rick A. Lazio today fended off skepticism from Democrats and sought to defend his plan as a way to continue and spread prosperity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, the Republican nominee, visited a thriving business in nearby Malta and then came here to discuss his tax plan in interviews with five television stations. Aides to Hillary Rodham Clinton, his Democratic opponent for the United States Senate, have called it a ''reckless'' venture that would squander the surplus and stifle the economic boom. Mrs. Clinton's campaign office said Mr. Lazio's plan would produce $1.24 trillion in cuts, rather than the $776 billion Mr. Lazio cited.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio fired back, saying:  ''This is a campaign that is based now entirely on fear-mongering, on negative attacks, on ripping our state apart. I can't imagine that Mrs. Clinton is proud of the kind of campaign that she's waging right now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's tax cut plan -- a compilation of ideas he has talked about on the stump as well as those advocated by other Republicans -- includes as its centerpiece a proposal to allow people to deduct from their federal income taxes the payroll tax that finances Social Security. He also called for reducing the capital gains tax to 15 percent from 20 percent and eliminating the inheritance tax and the so-called marriage tax, among other taxes. He suggested that federal surpluses of $4.4 trillion projected over the next 10 years would offset any loss of revenue.</p>
        <p>Just as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has sought this week to snuff out mounting criticism of his presidential campaign's $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut plan, which Democrats have also characterized as too risky, Mr. Lazio set out right away to back up his plan.</p>
        <p>Today, he toured the Racemark International Inc. plant in Malta. It is an industry leader in producing floor mats for cars, mainly high-end models by BMW and Mercedes-Benz, and this year orders have increased 15 percent, said the company chairman, Bob Bailey. Mr. Lazio said the company was a bright spot in an upstate economy that he said Mrs. Clinton viewed as too bleak. He said his tax cuts would bring the same prosperity to other parts of the state.</p>
        <p>And in five satellite interviews with stations in Buffalo, Binghamton, Syracuse, Rochester and Westchester County -- all markets in a region that both camps consider a key battleground for votes -- Mr. Lazio sought to drive home his points.</p>
        <p>''The estimates we have are based on nonpartisan sources,'' Mr. Lazio told viewers in Syracuse.</p>
        <p>''The reduction in the capital gains is important to stimulate business to continue to invest in themselves'' was a message for Rochester.</p>
        <p>''It's a responsible tax plan that will help incentivize economic development,'' he said to Westchester.</p>
        <p>But by the end of the day, Mrs. Clinton, for one, remained unconvinced. Her proposals would trim taxes by $496 billion over 10 years and include a cut in, rather than elimination of, the marriage penalty and inheritance tax. She has said that the surplus should be used first to pay down the national debt and then to shore up Social Security.</p>
        <p>''Hillary has presented New Yorkers a plan to provide targeted tax cuts and preserve Medicare and Social Security,'' said Cathie Levine, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton. ''Rick Lazio's reckless $1.2 trillion tax cut would explode the deficit and drive interest rates sky-high.''</p>
        <p>Her comment was in a statement that included a compilation of what the Clinton campaign said was Mr. Lazio's negative campaigning.</p>
