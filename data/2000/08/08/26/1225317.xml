        <p>The scene has shifted back to the familiar stage, with the principal stars ready again from last year, the year before and the year before that.</p>
        <p>This summer theater brings the promise of suspense, but always, it seems, leads to an inevitable outcome.</p>
        <p>The Houston Comets brushed by the Liberty in Game 1 of the Women's National Basketball Association championship, 59-52, on Thursday night at Madison Square Garden thanks to their superstars whose timely shots seemed to find the basket by muscle memory, and whose defense befuddled the home team.</p>
        <p>Because the W.N.B.A. championship is a two-of-three-game series, the Comets can win their fourth consecutive league title this afternoon in Houston, at the Compaq Center. The Liberty needs to win twice in a place where the Comets have lost only one playoff game in four years.</p>
        <p>For the third time in those four years, the Liberty arrives in Houston as the undaunted obstacle. ''We're not going down there to lose, I can tell you that,'' Liberty guard Becky Hammon said after Game 1.</p>
        <p>''This has been the Comets' ever since we opened up in 1997,'' Comets Coach Van Chancellor said. ''We are back to Houston. But just because we go to Houston doesn't mean we win.''</p>
        <p>The odds say otherwise. In 1997, the Liberty went to Houston for the one-game championship with the confidence of having won three regular-season games against Houston, then promptly lost, 65-51. In 1998, Phoenix was Houston's victim. Last year, the Liberty pushed the Comets to the limit, Teresa Weatherspoon's improbable halfcourt shot forcing Game 3, before bowing out again.</p>
        <p>''We've got to believe in the impossible, when no one else does,'' Weatherspoon said. ''Sure, we're somewhat frustrated because we didn't get this one at home and didn't play a tremendous basketball game, didn't put the ball in the basket. But those things happen and you have to come in and correct it.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty needs to correct its shooting first. After never leading in Game 1, the Liberty lost because it shot 32.1 percent and only center Tari Phillips scored in double figures. She had the best individual effort of anyone, including Houston's Cynthia Cooper, who hit the winning shot. Phillips had a game-high 24 points, shooting 10 for 19, and pulled down a game-high 15 rebounds.</p>
        <p>No one else on the Liberty made more than two field goals, going 0 for 8 from 3-point range, struggling to get free off screens. Tamika Whitmore missed 10 short-range shots.</p>
        <p>''I give them credit for their defense because they are very athletic and they can challenge shots,'' Liberty Coach Richie Adubato said, ''and we give up four, five inches to each person in our guard and small forward situation.''</p>
        <p>Hammon hit just one outside shot all night, guarded by Cooper, who is five inches taller.</p>
        <p>''At age 37, I thought this was Cynthia Cooper's best defensive game of the year,'' Chancellor said.</p>
        <p>Offensively, Cooper, the league's two-time Most Valuable Player, who has also captured every championship series M.V.P., scored 20 points. Sheryl Swoopes, this year's overall M.V.P., had 10 of her 12 points in the second half, and Tina Thompson had 10 of her 15 points in the first half.</p>
        <p>Together, the Big Three scored 47 of Houston's 59 points. Janeth Arcain (8 points) and Tammy Jackson (who had a key block in the final two minutes) have also played on all three championship teams.</p>
        <p>Despite Houston's experience and motivation, the Liberty still came within a minute of seizing the Game 1 victory. With 7 minutes 14 seconds left, the Liberty launched an 8-0 run that spanned the next six minutes. Weatherspoon's two foul shots made it 52-50 with 52.3 seconds left.</p>
        <p>But with 26.4 seconds remaining, Cooper, who has announced her intention to retire at the end of this season, beat the shot clock by four seconds with a baseline floater and drew the foul. The sequence gave Houston a 5-point cushion. No matter that Cooper had missed three shots before that. She was not thinking about retirement.</p>
        <p>Neither is the Liberty, which hopes to build on the bright spots in the loss. The Comets outrebounded the Liberty by only 35-34, while the Liberty held Houston to 35.5 percent shooting. For the final motivation, the Liberty can draw upon Weatherspoon's epic shot in last year's Game 2.</p>
        <p>The Comets, meanwhile, are fueled by the thought that they can become the first professional sports team since the National Hockey League's Islanders (1980-83) to win four straight titles.</p>
        <p>''We want to go out and play for 40 minutes and not make it come down to a halfcourt shot,'' Swoopes said. ''If we go out and take care of business in the first half and in the second half, then we should walk away champions.''</p>
