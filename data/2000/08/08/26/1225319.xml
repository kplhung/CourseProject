      <block class="full_text">
        <p>At 10:13 a.m. yesterday, investors in Emulex, a California company that makes fiber optic communications equipment, received some terrible news.</p>
        <p>Bloomberg News, a leading financial news service, reported that the company's chief executive had resigned and that Emulex planned to restate its earnings for the last two years.</p>
        <p>Investors rushed to shed their Emulex shares, and the stock plunged from $103 to $45 in 15 minutes. The drop stripped more than $2 billion from the company's market valuation before the Nasdaq stock market halted trading in the stock at about 10:30 a.m. The free fall dragged down several stocks of companies in similar businesses and even pulled down the broader Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>Dow Jones News Service, CBS.Marketwatch.com, the cable channel CNBC and other financial news outlets soon joined Bloomberg in reporting Emulex's woes, referring to a press release from the company.</p>
        <p>There was just one problem. The news was not true, as investors quickly learned, enabling Emulex to recover before the day was out. The statement was the latest -- and most devastating -- of several fake press releases and other hoaxes that have upset the financial markets. The two most prominent cases have been Lucent Technologies and PairGain Technologies.</p>
        <p>With trading volume soaring and longtime financial news providers like Dow Jones competing furiously with newer Internet services like CBS Marketwatch, business reporters have never faced more pressure to put out information fast. And with traders quick to punish stocks of companies with bad news, the odds have never been greater that a hoax will cause a stock to rise or fall, harming investors caught in the crosscurrents.</p>
        <p>''It's a scary thing to see something like this happen, because what the hoaxers are doing is taking advantage of the intense competition among the news agencies to get this thing out,'' said David Callaway, executive editor of CBS Marketwatch.</p>
        <p>F.B.I. agents in New York and Los Angeles, along with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, are investigating the fake release.</p>
        <p>The apparent motive for the fraud was to cause Emulex's stock to plunge, enabling someone to profit by buying put options or selling the stock short. Put options rise in value when a company's stock falls; short-selling is another way to profit from price declines. Many more Emulex put options than usual were bought on Thursday and yesterday, and a spokesman for the Chicago options exchange said it was conducting an investigation into who bought the puts. If caught, the perpetrators might be forced to give up their profits and could face criminal and civil fraud charges.</p>
        <p>By the end of the day, Emulex shares regained nearly all their losses after the company said that its business was stronger than ever. The stock closed at $105.75, down $7.31, on exceptionally heavy trading of more than 11 million shares.</p>
        <p>But that bounce will be cold comfort for Emulex investors who panicked and sold their shares yesterday morning, or who had ''limit orders'' to sell at some preset price, orders that were automatically executed as the company's shares plummeted. The S.E.C. and N.A.S.D. say that trades made yesterday morning will not be canceled.</p>
        <p>''All transactions prior to the halt will stand,'' said Wayne Lee, an N.A.S.D. spokesman. So, investors who sold their shares at the wrong time have little chance of being made whole, although Mr. Lee said investors could ask their brokers to share their losses. Regulators said investors who lost money might also be able to bring lawsuits against the perpetrators if they are caught.</p>
        <p>The genesis of the hoax appears to have been Internet Wire, a Los Angeles service that distributes press releases to news organizations and Web sites. At 9:30 a.m. Eastern time, just as the financial markets were opening, Internet Wire put out a release supposedly from Emulex that stated the company was revising its earnings for its quarter ended July 2 from a profit of 25 cents a share to a loss of 15 cents a share ''due to compliance with generally accepted accounting principles.''</p>
        <p>The release stated that ''Net earnings for fiscal 1998 and 1999 will also be revised,'' and some versions reported that Emulex's chief executive, Paul Folino, had resigned and that the S.E.C. had begun an investigation into Emulex's accounting.</p>
        <p>The release was automatically posted on some Web sites, including the CBS Marketwatch site, and within a few minutes people on the Emulex message board on Yahoo began calling attention to it. ''EMLX SEC investigation SELLLLL,'' wrote someone calling himself ''charles-ptrs'' at 9:46 a.m. After others questioned whether the release existed, ''mtnbrdr'' provided a link to the release.</p>
        <p>Emulex stock, which had closed Thursday at $113.06, steadily slid in the first minutes of trading yesterday. By 10:13 it had fallen to about $103, losing almost 10 percent of its value. But Emulex stock is generally volatile, so the move did not garner much attention.</p>
        <p>Then Bloomberg sent headlines summarizing the apparent press release to trading desks around the world, and the true rout began. In three minutes, Emulex stock lost another $10, sliding close to $90. Even without the Bloomberg headlines, that move would have been big enough to attract the attention of other news organizations, which closely monitor what stocks are rising and falling.</p>
        <p>As CNBC, TheStreet.com and others geared up to produce their own stories, Emulex kept falling. At 10:20, it touched $75. By 10:26, it had fallen as low as $50.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Emulex executives arriving at the company's offices at 7 a.m. Pacific time were perplexed by the decline in the company's stock, said Emulex's senior vice president, Kirk Roller. ''I walked in, my administrative assistant immediately said to me, 'The stock's down 45 points,' '' Mr. Roller said. ''By the time I got to Paul, the stock was down 68.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Folino, Emulex's chief executive, and Mr. Roller immediately asked the N.A.S.D. to halt trading in the company's stock. The N.A.S.D. soon did, but the damage had been done, and news organizations, including TheStreet.com, which has a joint venture with The New York Times, continued to report on the fake release until nearly 11 a.m.</p>
        <p>Matthew Winkler, Bloomberg's editor in chief, said Bloomberg had been right to report on the news release, especially since Emulex stock was already dropping. But Mr. Winkler said he was disappointed in his organization's handling of the episode. Bloomberg should have clearly explained that it had been unable to confirm the release or get a comment from the company, he said. Instead, the service simply rewrote the release as fact.</p>
        <p>Rick Stine, managing editor of Dow Jones News Service, said financial news agencies were extremely competitive because the traders they serve can make big profits if they get news even a few minutes before their competitors.</p>
        <p>''Does everyone want to be first? Yes,'' Mr. Stine said. As a result, Dow Jones will generally use information from press release agencies like PR Newswire and Internet Wire without checking directly with the companies mentioned in the releases, he said.</p>
        <p>Internet Wire, which was founded only six years ago, is the smallest of the three major press release agencies, trailing PR Newswire and Businesswire, much older organizations. Dave Armon, senior vice president at PR Newswire, said his company had much stricter procedures to verify press releases than Internet Wire, including always checking releases with the companies that supposedly have put them out.</p>
        <p>Emulex said Internet Wire never contacted the company to ensure the release was real. But Michael Terpin, chairman of Internet Wire, said his organization had fallen victim to a ''sophisticated fraud.'' The people behind the fraud ''were successful in convincing somebody from the nighttime shift that they had authorization from the daytime shift,'' Mr. Terpin said. ''They obviously had some kind of familiarity with our policies and procedures.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Terpin said the other news agencies had also been fooled into carrying fake releases. ''We have 135 employees,'' he said. ''We're not a little fly-by-night company.''</p>
        <p>In the last two years, fake press releases have moved the stocks of Lucent and PairGain, other high-technology companies. Lucent fell after a fake report said its earnings would be less than expected, while PairGain jumped on a false report that it would be taken over.</p>
        <p>Gary Dale Hoke, who worked at PairGain's engineering development operations in Raleigh, N.C., used online brokerage accounts at E*Trade and Ameritrade to buy and sell stocks, trading in PairGain shares and posting false messages on the Internet. He pleaded guilty to fraud and was ordered to pay $93,000 and sentenced to five years' probation, including five months of house arrest.</p>
