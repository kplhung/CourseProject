        <p>At a sentencing hearing for her estranged husband yesterday after a plea bargain was arranged, a millionaire investment executive bitterly accused the state court system of failing to sufficiently punish him for sneaking into her bedroom, bludgeoning her with a steel barbell and later announcing to one of their daughters, ''I've killed Mom.''</p>
        <p>The woman, Theresa Havell, 53, underwent extensive surgery to reconstruct her face after the attack in April 1999, which was witnessed by three of the couple's daughters, then ages 15, 12 and 11.</p>
        <p>Ms. Havell, who addressed the court about the effects of the crime, also complained about the bureaucratic handling of the case and the many delays. This month, a state appellate judge ordered her to pay $215,000 in legal fees to her husband's defense lawyers. Under New York divorce law, a spouse can receive some marital assets even if  accused of attacking a partner. Ms. Havell is appealing the ruling.</p>
        <p>Her comments came at the sentencing of her husband, Aftab Islam, a 59-year-old former securities executive from India, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Ms. Havell, who suffered a fractured skull and broken jaw requiring more than 100 stitches, criticized as too lenient a plea bargain that sentences Mr. Islam to eight years and three months in prison and five years on parole.</p>
        <p>''This judicial farce is a crime against my children,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Havell accused her husband's lawyer, Jack Litman, of being driven by greed and intentionally delaying the criminal case for 16 months by claiming he was not ready for trial. Mr. Litman, she said, then billed for 845 hours of legal work on the case.</p>
        <p>''Jack Litman, your son and my daughter were high school classmates,'' Ms. Havell said. ''How, as a father, can you explain your conduct to him?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Litman was not in court, but one of his partners, Richard M. Asche, denied that lawyers had intentionally delayed the trial.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Asche spoke, Mr. Islam, a frail-looking man in tan chino slacks and a white shirt, made his first public comments on the attack.</p>
        <p>He pledged his undying love to his wife and begged her and their children for forgiveness.</p>
        <p>''Since that beautiful day we first met 37 years ago I have loved her, cherished her and adored her,'' Mr. Islam said, referring to his wife.</p>
        <p>He then spoke of their six children, saying, 'I am still the same affectionate and doting father who loved you since birth, who picked you up from school on Fridays, who took you on play dates.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Islam, who claimed he was under the influence of alcohol and prescription drugs at the time of the attack, had been expected to mount a psychiatric defense at trial. Prosecutors said the attack occurred after Ms. Havell, who heads an investment firm with over $400 million in assets, asked Mr. Islam for a divorce.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney John Martin, dismissed Mr. Islam's explanation for the attack, pointing out that he had broken the locks on his wife's door earlier in the day, set his alarm for 4 a.m. and put on yellow dishwashing gloves before silently entering his wife's room with the 10-pound steel dumbbell.</p>
        <p>Ms. Havell survived the attack because she was awake and the children's nanny, Olanda Dornelles, 68, rushed to her aid, Mr. Martin said. Mr. Martin said he chose to accept the plea bargain to spare Ms. Havell and her children from having to testify against Mr. Islam at trial.</p>
        <p>Ms. Havell said yesterday that the injuries to her face and head had been so severe that one daughter assumed she was dead. Staring at her mother's mangled face just after the attack, the girl whispered, ''Bye-bye, Mommy,'' Ms. Havell said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Havell also complained about the various judges who were involved in her case, accusing Justice Felice K. Shea of allowing Mr. Litman to delay the proceedings and Acting Justice John A. K. Bradley of allowing Mr. Islam to plead guilty to first-degree assault instead of attempted murder.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors, who also agreed to the plea bargain, said that first-degree assault and attempted murder carried the same penalty. If convicted at trial of either charge, Mr. Islam would have faced a sentence of 5 to 25 years in prison.</p>
        <p>While the prosecutors portrayed him yesterday as arrogant and unrepentant, Mr. Islam described himself as a devoted parent. He told his two oldest children, who were in court, ''You are my best work.''</p>
