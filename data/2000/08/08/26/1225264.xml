        <p>Dido showed signs of ascertaining her uniqueness during her performance Monday night at Roseland. She  uses ambient hip-hop beats and synthesizers to sleekly modernize a sound that otherwise recalls the pristine folk-rock of British songbirds from Linda Thompson to Dolores O'Riordan of the Cranberries.

        <p>Voices have prints, the way fingers do. The swirls and tiny cracks in a performer's tone make the singer more than just a skilled anonymous craftsman. Yet discerning the marks that make a singer exceptional isn't as easy as pressing thumb to paper. The ones that stand out cultivate those distinguishing qualities without sacrificing a well-shaped tone.</p>
        <p>Dido showed signs of ascertaining her uniqueness during her performance Monday night at Roseland. She  uses ambient hip-hop beats and synthesizers to sleekly modernize a sound that otherwise recalls the pristine folk-rock of British songbirds from Linda Thompson to Dolores O'Riordan of the Cranberries. Dido has spent a year and a half on the road with the material from ''No Angel,'' her Arista Records debut; the unusually strong label support she has received as a debut artist is paying off commercially and artistically.</p>
        <p>The singer, once part of the moody dance band Faithless, has a talent that has proved portable. Her first single, ''Here With Me,'' has found listeners as the theme to the WB Network's sleeper hit, ''Roswell.'' And a sample from ''Thank You,'' her next single, graces Eminem's latest hit, ''Stan,'' making Dido part of the best-selling album of the year. Aided by these crossovers, ''No Angel'' received gold certification this week.</p>
        <p>Dido happily performed these songs tied to her good fortune, along with most of the material from ''No Angel,'' during her short set. She also broke out some new material, including the intriguing ''Don't Leave Home,'' in which she took on the persona of a drug seducing an addict. Most of Dido's songs used the first person in a more conventional sense as they expressed a desire for romantic love balanced with independence. They were ingenue moments, milking the singer's fresh-faced vulnerability.</p>
        <p>Paying attention to the singer's craft sometimes lifted Dido from these familiar spots. For a while, Alex Alexander, the percussionist, stepped from behind his kit and played a hand-held drum. Dido explored jazz syncopation, enlivening her verses with jumpy rhythms.</p>
        <p>Mostly, though, she stuck to the code of today's female singer-songwriter. Acoustic guitar and gentle bass mixed with mildly trippy electronic elements to form a lush bed behind her melancholy reveries. Interestingly, though, Dido seemed to become more of herself when she scratched up the sound a bit. She is clearly still getting a grip on her deeper side.</p>
