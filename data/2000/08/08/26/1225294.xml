        <p>Shortly after Florida State's football players assembled to begin their quest for a second straight unbeaten season, the team doctor was giving his annual speech about the various viruses that could strike them. He showed a slide of a player who lost much of his hair because of a virus. Suddenly, many of the players in the room began pointing at Chris Weinke and chanting, ''Chris! Chris! Chris!''</p>
        <p>It was their playful way of having a few laughs at the expense of Weinke, their 28-year-old quarterback, who has a prominent bald spot.</p>
        <p>''He is not holding his age well,'' tight end Ryan Sprague said.</p>
        <p>Now that word is out that Weinke's high school class in St. Paul had its 10-year reunion this year, Weinke, Florida State's senior leader, may face a new wave of jokes about his age. He has been called Methuselah and Rip Van Weinke by his teammates, but not often in front of him.</p>
        <p>''I've laid down the law,'' said Weinke, who will be back at quarterback Saturday night when Florida State, ranked No. 2 in the Associated Press news media poll, opens its season at home against Brigham Young, which was 8-4 last season. ''I don't want to date myself. For the most part, I don't feel out of place at all.''</p>
        <p>He fits most on the football field, where he is a dream come true for Coach Bobby Bowden, who is 70. Weinke is the first three-year starter at quarterback in a quarter-century at F.S.U. With Weinke surrounded by talented blockers and receivers and experienced running backs, Bowden says he has a pat hand on offense.</p>
        <p>Weinke comes into this season with a 21-1 record as a starter, including 20 victories in a row. He holds school records for the number of 200-yard games passing (20) and yards per completion (14.8), and is in position to break many of the others.</p>
        <p>''He's better today than he was last year,'' Bowden said. ''He's sharper and more accurate with his passes, and there's less hesitation on where he's going with the ball.''</p>
        <p>Once Weinke decided in January that he would return for his senior season rather than opt for the National Football League draft, he decided to improve his physical condition dramatically. Never mind that teammates say he is a millionaire already, mostly from real estate investments with the money he received from six seasons as an infielder in the Toronto Blue Jays organization. He dropped nearly 20 pounds, to 229.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to do whatever I could do to be the best that I could be,'' he said. ''My main focus was getting quicker. I wanted to be able to move around better than I did last year.''</p>
        <p>He will still be a drop-back passer, mindful of the career-threatening neck injury he suffered two seasons ago, but he says he will not be an easy target anymore.</p>
        <p>''You're not going to see me running around,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His offensive line, acutely aware that Weinke's health may well make a difference in whether the Seminoles repeat as national champions, has sworn to keep the opposition off of him. Of course, it helps that Tarlos Thomas, a senior, and Brett Williams, a sophomore, are pro-caliber tackles and that the senior guards Justin Amman and Jerry Carmichael have extensive starting experience.</p>
        <p>''Our goal this year is not to give up any sacks,'' Thomas said. ''I mean we don't want his jersey dirty, unless we're patting him on the back after a touchdown.''</p>
        <p>Weinke was never close to leaving F.S.U. for the N.F.L., he says now. For one thing, some pro scouts projected him as a third-round pick, at best. For another, he knew the Seminoles were loaded for another title run.</p>
        <p>''I could sit on the bench and make the minimum of whatever they're paying up there,'' he said, ''and I'd be watching Florida State on TV every Saturday knowing I could be a part of that.''</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-5-inch Weinke shrugs off talk about his Heisman Trophy candidacy, which figures to blossom if F.S.U. picks up where it left off last season, when it capped a 12-0 season with a 46-29 victory over Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl.</p>
        <p>''I'm not here to win any awards,'' he said. ''I'm not here to do anything but win a national championship.''</p>
        <p>Yet in the next breath, some ego does surface.</p>
        <p>''People are going to realize that I came back for a reason: to be the most dominating quarterback who has ever played here,'' he said. ''I think I can do that, because I know what it takes to get there.''</p>
        <p>This season, Weinke will not have his favorite receiver, Peter Warrick, who has gone to the pros. While Bowden says that because of Warrick's distinctive explosive moves, the next version of him ''is probably down in elementary school somewhere; about every 10 years you see one like him,'' Weinke believes the Seminoles are loaded with talented receivers.</p>
        <p>He points out that in the two games Warrick missed last season, against Miami and Wake Forest, he completed passes to 11 and 10 receivers.</p>
        <p>''That's one big reason I came back,'' he said. ''I know what kind of ability these guys have.''</p>
