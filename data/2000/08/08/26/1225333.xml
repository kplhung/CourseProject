        <p>Angry over the use of his face on billboard advertising as far away as Oshkosh, Wis., Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday repeated a threat to file suit against an animal rights group that is trying to publicize a possible link between milk consumption and various illnesses, including prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>''The ad is tasteless,'' Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference yesterday, adding that he would decide over the weekend whether to sue the group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which is based in Norfolk, Va. ''My illness is a very public matter, which I am fine with, but I don't like people exploiting it, either.''</p>

        <p>Angry over the use of his face on billboard advertising as far away as Oshkosh, Wis., Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday repeated a threat to file suit against an animal rights group that is trying to publicize a possible link between milk consumption and various illnesses, including prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>''The ad is tasteless,'' Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference yesterday, adding that he would decide over the weekend whether to sue the group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which is based in Norfolk, Va. ''My illness is a very public matter, which I am fine with, but I don't like people exploiting it, either.''</p>
        <p>The mayor's threat of legal action, which he made initially in comments to reporters on Thursday night, did not appear to have deterred the animal rights group yesterday. It said it would put up more of the billboards.</p>
        <p>The dispute centers on ads that the group, known as PETA, has posted this week in three cities in milk-producing areas -- Lancaster, Pa., and Oshkosh and Appleton in central Wisconsin. The ads parody the ubiquitous ''Got Milk?'' campaign sponsored by the dairy industry, and are dominated by what appears to be an oversize mug shot of Mr. Giuliani with a band of white -- intended to look like milk -- above his upper lip.</p>
        <p>A brief text reads ''Got prostate cancer?'' Below that phrase, it asserts, ''Drinking milk contributes to prostate cancer.''</p>
        <p>PETA, known for its strident tactics in promoting animal rights, said the ad was intended to protest the dairy industry, not Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Bruce Friedrich, the group's vegetarian-campaign coordinator, said yesterday that PETA hoped the ad would draw attention to studies that have raised the possibility of a link between dairy consumption and several types of serious illnesses, and to what he called the hypocrisy of the dairy industry in promoting the health benefits of milk.</p>
        <p>Although scientists are uncertain about the exact cause of prostate cancer, according to the American Cancer Society, there is an increased risk of the disease associated with eating animal fat, red meats and dairy products.</p>
        <p>Mr. Friedrich would not say how many more billboards would be erected, or where. But it seemed unlikely that the ads would find their way to New York City, since PETA said it had already been rejected by several companies that post ads on billboards, in subways and on taxis in the city.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the advertising agency in Wisconsin that put up the two billboards there said they would be taken down, according to The Associated Press. Wisconsin farm leaders attacked the ads as misleading and insensitive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who has declined to specify which treatment he is undergoing for his prostate cancer, has reacted to the ads by keeping a glass of milk at his side in public appearances and by making repeated references to drinking milk. At a town hall meeting at the Norman Thomas High School in Manhattan, he turned from the podium several times to drink a glass of milk and to refill it from a half-gallon carton. And on his weekly radio call-in show, he broke away for a commercial by telling the program's listeners he would ''take a short glass of milk and come back.''</p>
