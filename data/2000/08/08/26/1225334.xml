        <p>An American political campaign just doesn't get any better than it has in this convention summer of 2000. We've seen strange ideological bedfellows perpetrate Machiavellian intrigues. The sudden emergence of dark-horse candidates and collapse of front-runners. No-holds-barred debates.</p>
        <p>No wonder the nation has been riveted. But now we must awaken to the grim reality: This season's run of ''Survivor'' is over.</p>
        <p>Which leaves us with the strange residue of ''official'' politics offered by the twin conventions -- neither of which, even on their best nights, drew close to half the audience of Wednesday's ''Survivor'' finale. Through a weird cultural reversal, America is now a place where there's more spontaneity and ''reality'' in a prime-time network entertainment series than there is in the TV spectacles staged by our political parties over supposedly momentous issues of public policy.</p>
        <p>The audience that cast its vote by Nielsen isn't stupid. It does prize authenticity over canned showmanship. And with John McCain long out of the race, authenticity isn't on the ballot. As that minority of Americans paying attention knows, the choice this year is between two distinctive brands of inauthenticity: the faux rainbow coalition that George W. Bush showcased under the brand Compassionate Conservatism in Philadelphia vs. the populism lite that Al Gore marketed as Fighting for Working Families last week in L.A.</p>
        <p>You've got to give the Democrats credit. Mr. Gore has pulled ahead, at least for now, because he did a much cleverer job than his rival of giving his inauthenticity the gloss of credibility. The media that repetitively noted the ''scripted'' quality of the G.O.P. convention, and the gap between the dense minority population on stage and the restricted-country-club demographics in the hall, didn't harp as relentlessly on the discrepancy between Mr. Gore's message (''They're for the powerful -- we're for the people'') and the reality at the Staples Center. Sex, as always, is a fatal distraction for the Washington press pack, and so the Al-Tipper kiss (''disgusting,'' according to Robert Novak) and the tiff over the Playboy mansion (arguably one of the week's classier venues) easily upstaged the more telling story. The Democratic convention was showered with an avalanche of big money, much of it coughed up by the same powerful interests (big oil, Hollywood, polluters, even tobacco) that were attacked by the nominees from the podium.</p>
        <p>The parties at Spago and Armani in Beverly Hills, like Tom DeLay's fat-cat golf outings in Philadelphia, were usually kept out of camera view. So was the celebration in the skybox of Terry McAuliffe, the Clinton-era Democratic money siphon who has been praised by Mr. Gore as ''the greatest fund-raiser in the history of the universe.'' As reported by Holly Bailey of the Center for Responsive Politics, Mr. McAuliffe and movie-industry potentates ''dined on cake iced with an illustration of President Clinton's face.'' Here is a power-to-the-people movement that even Marie Antoinette could love.</p>
        <p>Instead of these Gilded Age images we got a very shrewdly packaged portrait of fightin' Al and Joe. In his acceptance speech, the vice president talked about growing up in Tennessee but not of his childhood residence at the Fairfax Hotel in Washington; he mentioned his brief stint studying religion at Vanderbilt but not his four years at Harvard; he recounted in detail his parents' working-class backgrounds as a rhetorical bait-and-switch to camouflage his St. Albans pedigree. A particularly brilliant touch was the just-folks video about Mr. Gore made by Spike Jonze, the gifted director of ''Being John Malkovich.'' This filmmaker was the perfect choice for the assignment of transforming an American prince into an Everyman, since he has already performed the same identity transplant on himself; the spiky Mr. Jonze was born Adam Spiegel, heir to the clothing-catalog fortune.</p>
        <p>The gap between Joseph Lieberman's L.A. persona and his offstage reality was also deftly abridged. Check out the nonpartisan statistics at opensecrets.org: This newly passionate champion of the oppressed health-care consumer has received more campaign cash from insurance companies (many based in his home state, Connecticut) than any other senator and is third in contributions from pharmaceutical giants.</p>
        <p>Nor is he immune to paydays from the entertainment companies he browbeats for profiteering from cultural sewage. In his last financial statement, Mr. Lieberman's biggest source of outside income was a book advance from Simon &amp; Schuster, whose parent company makes zillions from a particular Lieberman-William Bennett bete noire, ''The Howard Stern Show.'' Throw in Mr. Lieberman's abrupt recantations of previous positions on affirmative action and Social Security, and it's easy to see why last week he could be found spinning faster than a dreidel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is no less inauthentic than his Democratic opponents, of course. In his acceptance speech, he paid tribute to his hometown of Midland, Tex., and its motto of ''the sky's the limit.'' Somehow he failed to mention the decade he spent at Andover, Yale and Harvard, where the mottos ranged from ''Finis origine pendet'' and ''Lux et veritas'' to the charmingly soigne ''Veritas.'' In truth, he has enjoyed far more inherited wealth and privilege than Mr. Gore has; he leads a party that opposes affirmative action even as he benefited from the affirmative action given to ''legacies'' (the children of alumni) at Ivy League schools.</p>
        <p>But it's a measure of how much Mr. Gore has outwitted Mr. Bush that the vice president was able to tar the Texas governor as a lightweight frat boy with the line ''the presidency is more than a popularity contest,'' while simultaneously stopping at nothing to best him in that popularity contest. Mr. Gore's wife, daughters and least Harvard-esque college roommate, Tommy Lee Jones, were all milked to imbue Mr. Gore with the popular traits (warmth and testosterone) he was thought to lack. Let Mr. Bush brag incessantly about his ''heart'' -- Mr. Gore one-upped him by clasping his own heart Sammy Sosa-style. Even Bill Clinton hadn't thought of that one.</p>
        <p>The measure of the Democrats' success last week can be seen in Mr. Bush's angry cries that Mr. Gore is stirring up ''class warfare.'' Again, the vice president has faked him out. Mr. Gore is not an authentic populist preaching class warfare -- he's an inauthentic populist supported by corporate interests who hijacks populist sloganeering to vilify a few focus-group-chosen industries that most middle-class Americans understandably regard as ripoffs.</p>
        <p>And he knows that Mr. Bush can't fight back on that turf. While Democrats are indeed awash in insurance company money, drug company money and even oil money (the Gore family portfolio holds a fat chunk of Occidental Petroleum), the Bush-Cheney ticket and G.O.P. Congressional leadership have taken in far more loot still from all these sources, with worse prescription-drug plans, patients' bills of rights and environmental records to show for it. If the Democrats are inauthentic fighters for the little man, they are at least less inauthentic than the Republicans. This year that's what makes a horse race, unless you're besotted by the idea of casting a protest vote for Ralph Nader.</p>
        <p>In fairness, it must be noted that the two major tickets have yielded one completely authentic candidate between them this year -- Dick Cheney. As a young, future defense secretary who didn't oppose the Vietnam War, Mr. Cheney nonetheless repeatedly sought deferments from military service because, as he honestly has put it, ''I had other priorities in the 60's.'' And much as he preferred feathering his own nest to the inconvenience of public service then, so he does three decades later -- refusing so far to give up future oil-company stock options worth at least $6 million at today's prices even though they pose a conflict of interest with the vice presidency (and even though he walks away with a consolation prize valued at an additional $30 million).</p>
        <p>In a political year in which everyone is suddenly on the side of the people, the unabashed and unapologetic consistency of Mr. Cheney's devotion to his own self-interest is downright refreshing. He's as close as the casting agents at either party have come to producing a rival to the cool corporate operator Richard Hatch, the ''Survivor'' antihero Americans love to hate.</p>
