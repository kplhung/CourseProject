        <p>No matter how big a lead the Giants might have late in a regular-season game -- if they ever get such a lead -- do not be surprised if Coach Jim Fassel declines to remove his starters.</p>
        <p>Tonight at Giants Stadium, for the third time in four preseason games, the Giants' reserves squandered a first-half lead and the Giants concluded the preseason without a victory for the first time in 29 years.</p>
        <p>The Baltimore Ravens, with 24 second-half points, overcame a 10-point deficit to win the preseason finale for both teams, 24-17. It left the Giants 0-4 this month, and while that left them mildly disappointed, the prevailing emotion seemed to be relief that the preseason was over.</p>
        <p>Because there were no major injuries and the Giants' starters left the game with a 7-0 lead, most players were already looking ahead to the regular-season opener against Arizona on Sept. 3.</p>
        <p>''If we get a win next week,'' Giants defensive tackle Keith Hamilton said, ''no one will be talking about being 0-4 in the preseason.''</p>
        <p>Fassel seemed almost upbeat, even if his team became the first since the 1971 Giants to finish the preseason without a victory. The 1971 team lost six preseason games and went 4-10 in the regular season.</p>
        <p>''I don't know when I've looked forward to the end of a preseason more than this one,'' Fassel said. ''Because we're 0-4, because I think this team has gotten better and because I think we've got a chance to be real good.</p>
        <p>''I think we've improved and I want to move on to the next phase. Starting next weekend, everybody's record is 0-0.''</p>
        <p>Long before the Ravens' game-winning touchdown -- a 3-yard run midway through the fourth quarter by Jason Brookins against the Giants' second-team defense -- the Giants' first units on offense and defense looked sharp, although they played slightly less than the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Giants quarterback Kerry Collins completed 3 of 7 passes for 29 yards. The rookie running back Ron Dayne, who had 60 yards on 15 carries, made a dramatic, powerful run into the end zone from 5 yards out for the game's opening touchdown.</p>
        <p>Cornerback Jason Sehorn made two sparkling plays and, after committing 16 penalties last week in a preseason loss to the Jets, the Giants were whistled for only five tonight -- none by the first-string offensive line.</p>
        <p>''I see us coming together in a lot of ways,'' Collins said. ''I'm excited. I think we saw a little more of what we can expect from Ron Dayne tonight. Ron Dixon had a great game, too.''</p>
        <p>For the first time in the preseason, Dayne played the majority of his time with the starters. Although Tiki Barber started the game at running back, Dayne came in after the first play. By the Giants' second possession, Dayne was the focus of the offense, with four carries for 19 yards.</p>
        <p>In one sequence, Dayne carried on three successive downs, picking up the first down off left tackle on a tough third-and-2 play. Two plays later, after a 20-yard pass from Collins to Ike Hilliard, Dayne took a pitch from Collins and moved to his right. Most impressive, he waited for the hole to open, then cut back through it for his 5-yard touchdown, going in almost untouched.</p>
        <p>The touchdown drive was set up by another big play by Barber, who has had the best preseason of any Giants offensive player. Barber caught a Baltimore punt on his 30-yard line and, seeing the slimmest of openings in the middle of the punt coverage, burst up the field. He made two cuts to escape tackles before being brought down at the Baltimore 39.</p>
        <p>But Barber's return was not the most notable return by the Giants tonight. The Giants' lone score of the second half was a 90-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Dixon.</p>
        <p>Dixon fielded the kickoff and slowly made his way up the right sideline, waiting for his teammates blocking in front of him.</p>
        <p>But when he saw a narrow crease along the right sideline, he bolted through it with such a burst of speed that neither kicker Matt Stover nor the Ravens' final defender, Clarence Love, could get a hand on him.</p>
        <p>The Giants' first-string defense played far more dependably tonight than it did against the Jets last week, with Sehorn active in a variety of ways. First, he knocked quarterback Tony Banks down on a blitz, forcing an incompletion.</p>
        <p>Later, defending wide receiver Jermaine Lewis in man-to-man coverage, Sehorn was in perfect position to slip around him to bat down a pass without making contact.</p>
        <p>Against the Giants' reserves, Baltimore's third-string quarterback, the rookie Chris Redman, threw two touchdown passes. And then, for the second consecutive time in this annual preseason game between the Giants and Ravens, Baltimore wide receiver Brandon Stokley became a star.</p>
        <p>A year ago, Stokley scored a touchdown on the game's final play, when Giants safety Lyle West went for an interception and missed the pass. Tonight, Stokley returned a punt 32 yards -- after the Giants' Craig Walendy and Brandon Short appeared to have him stopped for no gain -- to set up the game-winning score.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>STEVE EHRHART, the general manager for the Memphis franchise of the XFL, said Friday that JIM SKIPPER, the former Giants assistant coach, was not the team's new head coach. The Giants announced Thursday that Skipper was leaving to become the Memphis head coach. Ehrhart announced that he was not ruling Skipper out but that ''we're not going in that direction right now.'' Skipper is expected to get another coaching job in the XFL. . . . The Giants on Friday claimed cornerback RAMOS McDONALD from waivers. McDonald started 12 games with Minnesota and San Francisco last season, but was put on waivers by the 49ers Thursday.</p>
