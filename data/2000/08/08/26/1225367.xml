        <p>On April 15, 1989, a wild 25-year-old Montreal left-hander started against Pittsburgh and could not get out of the second inning. None of the five outs he recorded were strikeouts.</p>
        <p>Last night, three teams and 352 games later, that pitcher faced a Mets lineup that included no position players who were active back then. And for the first time since then, Randy Johnson, the second-leading left-handed strikeout pitcher in baseball history, failed to fan a batter.</p>
        <p>The Mets own Johnson, the best pitcher in the National League. There is no mistaking that now, not after they clobbered him and the Arizona Diamondbacks, 13-3, at Shea Stadium in a victory that increased their lead in the National League wild-card race to five and a half games over Arizona.</p>
        <p>Since the opening game of the division series last October, Johnson has faced the Mets four times. The Mets have won each game, and in those games Johnson is 0-3 with a 7.29 earned run average.</p>
        <p>There are mind games at work: the Mets believe they can beat Johnson, who seems confused by them.</p>
        <p>''It's as much our confidence against him,'' first baseman Todd Zeile said. ''I mean, he's an intimidating, aggressive, dominating pitcher, and if we don't show that we're intimidated, and we actually seem like we're looking forward to facing him because we're rising to the challenge, that takes some of that edge away.''</p>
        <p>Rick Reed, meanwhile, threw his fastball with precision and worked seven strong innings to improve to 8-4. Two victories have come against Johnson, who looks very different in person, Reed said.</p>
        <p>''When you watch him on TV, he's a totally different pitcher,'' Reed said. ''When he comes here, maybe we are in his head. I don't know. I guess we have his number.''</p>
        <p>In a brief postgame interview, Johnson revealed little. ''I take full responsibility,'' Johnson said. ''It's my job as a pitcher to keep us in the game. When I go out there and pitch the way I did, I didn't do that.''</p>
        <p>Johnson (16-5), the major league strikeout leader this year, has 2,971 career strikeouts, second only to the Hall of Famer Steve Carlton among left-handers. Despite his struggles against the Mets, he had always shown hints of his dominance.  In 18 2/3 innings over three games, Johnson had struck out 29 Mets.</p>
        <p>But last night he fanned no one and could get only seven outs. The Mets collected six hits and six runs in two and a third innings off Johnson, who walked two, made one error and watched as a Gold Glove-winning teammate made another.</p>
        <p>Johnson was not throwing as hard as usual, with most fastballs in the low 90's, and he gave up several hits on his slider. Manager Bobby Valentine noticed Johnson throwing changeups in slider counts, a sign Johnson did not have confidence in the pitch that makes him so devastating.</p>
        <p>''He didn't have his A fastball or his A slider today, but he went out there and battled and gave it everything he had,'' Mets center fielder Jay Payton said. ''But he's usually 95 to 97 on the gun, and he only had a couple of pitches up there tonight. He didn't have his A game tonight.''</p>
        <p>Zeile also noted that each time the Mets have beaten Johnson, they have capitalized on Arizona's mistakes. Those mistakes came in the second and the third innings last night, and Zeile was involved in both rallies.</p>
        <p>Zeile, who had no hits and five strikeouts in 10 career at-bats against Johnson, knocked a slider up the middle for a leadoff single in the second. Johnson then walked Benny Agbayani on four fastballs to bring up Payton.</p>
        <p>Johnson had said he needed to establish his inside fastball to beat the Mets. But his pitch was outside, and Payton drove it to right field for a run-scoring single.</p>
        <p>With Agbayani at third, Mike Bordick chopped a ball to third, where Matt Williams bobbled it on the transfer from his glove to his hand. As his throw arrived home, Agbayani slid around catcher Damian Miller to give the Mets a 2-0 lead.</p>
        <p>The next two batters bunted: Reed to get Payton to third, and Joe McEwing to bring Payton home.</p>
        <p>Considering the error and the bunts, Johnson was having no luck. But he made his own bad luck in the third. Edgardo Alfonzo, starting for the first time since Monday after missing time with a stiff neck, lined a slider to left to lead off the inning, bringing up Mike Piazza.</p>
        <p>Piazza chopped a ball in front of the plate, and Johnson caught it on one hop. He wheeled to start a double play, but fired low, under the glove of Tony Womack at second. Johnson threw his head back disgustedly as Alfonzo went to third. Zeile drove Alfonzo in when he singled on a fastball above the belt.</p>
        <p>Again, Johnson walked Agbayani on four fastballs. Again, Payton followed with a drive to right with runners on. Danny Bautista misjudged it, and the ball rolled to the fence as two runs scored and the Mets took a 6-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Agbayani was thrown out at home, but the 38,237 fans at Shea did not care. They were having too much fun roaring at Johnson, who was lifted in the third inning, his shortest start in more than four years.</p>
        <p>A three-run homer by Steve Finley cut the deficit to three runs, but Agbayani's three-run double in the sixth made the game a rout and ensured another victory over Johnson, an improbable feat that is routine for the Mets.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>MIKE HAMPTON had a strong bullpen session last night and will start tomorrow against Arizona. Hampton, who left his start nine days ago with a stress fracture in his right ribs, said the pain was ''mild, but bearable'' after throwing at close to maximum effort and using all his pitches. With Hampton starting, GLENDON RUSCH and AL LEITER will get an extra day of rest between starts. . . . Left fielder BENNY AGBAYANI went 3 for 3 with two walks and has reached base in his last nine plate appearances. . . . ROBIN VENTURA played an inning at first base last night, his first appearance there since last May 5.</p>
