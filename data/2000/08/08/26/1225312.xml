        <p>It seemed a long way to travel to preach to the choir. Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush each courted Florida voters this week, but spoke mostly to the already converted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore made his party's usual pilgrimage to the retirement condominiums of Broward County north of Miami, a loyal Democratic base, where he spoke about protecting Social Security.</p>
        <p>''I got goose bumps,'' said Renee Kugler, 66, of Tamarac, at Mr. Gore's talk on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, the Texas governor campaigning in the state where his brother, Jeb Bush, is in his first term as governor, met today with a largely Cuban-American audience in Miami, a long-devoted Republican constituency. He challenged Fidel Castro to embrace democracy, and got a standing ovation.</p>
        <p>''There may have been five minutes during the Democratic National Convention when I stopped to think about how well things are going,'' said Heidi Marcelo, a 20-year-old Cuban-American, at Mr. Bush's talk this morning at Florida International University. ''Now I've gone right back to Bush.''</p>
        <p>As campaign stops go, for each man, it was the equivalent of an overstuffed armchair, soft, familiar and comfortable.</p>
        <p>But far back in the audience at Mr. Bush's speech, Jorge Herrera wondered why a candidate would court votes he already has instead of trying to change other voters' minds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Herrera, a minority among Cuban-Americans, plans to vote for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''Gore needs to come here,'' said Mr. Herrera, 19, who studies political science at Florida International.</p>
        <p>''I come from a middle class family, and Gore seems to suit my needs more,'' he said. Other young Cuban-Americans might side with him if they saw Mr. Gore in person, Mr. Herrera said.</p>
        <p>He came to hear Mr. Bush with an open mind, willing to be swayed, said Mr. Herrera, who lives in Miami.</p>
        <p>But, he said, ''all Bush talked about today were the things that people here wanted to hear,'' such as continued sanctions against Cuba, and expanded trade elsewhere in Latin America.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore did not seek votes in Little Havana. Mr. Bush did not court the condo vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not reach out to black Miamians, almost a forgotten constituency in Miami. But then, neither did Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Gore is already pretty solid with the black community down here,'' said Garth Reeves, publisher emeritus of The Miami Times, a newspaper devoted to black readers. ''We're a little afraid of Bush.''</p>
        <p>Voters in the middle said they heard or saw little to sway them in the newspapers or on television.</p>
        <p>''Gore doesn't talk about anything interesting,'' said Fred Truby, a 37-year-old fund-raiser for nonprofit organizations. ''Who is he? He's a Southern boy but he's a senator's son. He went to Vietnam for the war, but he didn't fight.</p>
        <p>''I'm really upset about Bush,'' said Mr. Truby, who lives in South Miami. ''While his dad was president, he was just a party boy.''</p>
        <p>But then, neither candidate seemed to care about that sliver of undecided voters.</p>
        <p>In Miami, where a large part of the population was Republican to begin with and incensed by the Clinton administration's handling of the Elian Gonzalez custody battle, Mr. Bush was welcomed as a hero.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not mention Elian Gonzalez -- he did not have to. Many players in the saga -- including Ramon Saul Sanchez, who organized street protests -- were in the audience, and are already in his camp.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's much-talked-about break from Mr. Clinton on the Elian Gonzalez case -- saying that he thought a family court should decide the matter -- has been largely dismissed and even ridiculed here as a political gesture.</p>
        <p>So, instead of dwelling on that issue, Mr. Bush tersely denounced Mr. Castro and promised to resurrect free-trade negotiations with Latin America.</p>
        <p>''He should have been more verbal about the situation in Cuba,'' said Alex Acosta, 18, who studies international relations at Florida International. But he considers himself a strong Bush supporter.</p>
        <p>The Republican rallies at Florida International have, like the Democratic rallies at the condos, become a  political tradition. Mr. Bush's father and brother kicked off their Florida campaigns here.</p>
        <p>''I was a supporter of his father and his brother, and he will have my vote as well,'' said Scherry Jenkins, a member of the Republican Women's Club of Coconut Grove.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, had that same warm reception, if not more so, in what people refer to here as the condo canyons.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kugler said she was willing to consider Mr. Bush, but quickly dismissed him after seeing recent news coverage of him. He just seemed fake, she said.</p>
        <p>''I just don't like Bush,'' said Mrs. Kugler, who moved to South Florida 28 years ago. ''He has this look on his face, this smirk. He just doesn't cut it for us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, by contrast, ''oozes with compassion,'' Mrs. Kugler said. And Mr. Gore is tightly bound to them by his political promises.</p>
        <p>''Prescription drugs are a big burden for us,'' Mrs. Kugler said of the older residents of the condos. ''He's trying to make it easier.''</p>
        <p>Lil Kaufman, who lives in the Kings Point condo in Tamarac, said there were some ''undecideds'' among the older residents going into Mr. Gore's visit, but ''I think they're decided now.''</p>
        <p>It was not that Mr. Gore pulled huge numbers to him on this trip, but cemented the cracks in his support, older residents here said.</p>
        <p>''Florida is a tough one for Gore,'' said J. P. Monroe, a political science professor at the University of Miami. ''This state is leaning Bush.''</p>
