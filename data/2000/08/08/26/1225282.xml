        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Although I have doubts about bilingual education as we have known it, I take issue with an Aug. 23 letter that says the ability of Europeans to speak more than one language proves that bilingualism can be achieved outside the classroom.</p>
        <p>Millions of Americans come from families that immigrated from non-English-speaking countries, yet too many in the second or third generation have lost their fluency in the original language.</p>
        <p>Schools should be making extra efforts to provide courses that give students incentives to strengthen their use of English while they continue expanding their original language. We should not repeat the error of the last two centuries, when the drive to assimilate resulted in the loss of second languages among so many Americans. This is what bilingual education should be about.</p>
