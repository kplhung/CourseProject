        <p>Two former employees of a mortgage brokerage firm near Albany  became so annoyed when a New York City woman pulled out of a deal, the police said, that they harassed her for months by calling on the phone and clucking like a chicken.</p>
        <p>The two men, Scott Chittenden, 28, of Cohoes, N.Y., and Victor Guilianelle, 32, of Ballston Lake, N.Y., were arrested on Thursday and charged with aggravated harassment, the Cohoes Police Department said. Both are free on bail pending a court appearance next week. If convicted, each faces up to a year in prison.</p>

        <p>Two former employees of a mortgage brokerage firm near Albany  became so annoyed when a New York City woman pulled out of a deal, the police said, that they harassed her for months by calling on the phone and clucking like a chicken.</p>
        <p>The two men, Scott Chittenden, 28, of Cohoes, N.Y., and Victor Guilianelle, 32, of Ballston Lake, N.Y., were arrested on Thursday and charged with aggravated harassment, the Cohoes Police Department said. Both are free on bail pending a court appearance next week. If convicted, each faces up to a year in prison.</p>
        <p>To protect her privacy, the police withheld the name of the woman, who is a secretary at the State Labor Department in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In addition to clucking over the phone, the police said, the two men also clipped Perdue chicken advertisements from newspapers and mailed them to their victim, and Mr. Chittenden once called her, pretending to be Regis Philbin and inviting her to be a contestant on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>''They thought it was really funny,'' said Detective Lt. Tom Ross, of the Cohoes department. ''And once they saw her reaction, they got caught up in it. They got hooked.''</p>
        <p>The two made 30 to 40 calls over three or four months, Lieutenant Ross said, after the woman reneged on a home mortgage deal.</p>
        <p>''Hey, she got a better rate,'' he  said. ''I think we've all been hit up with telemarketers. Usually, they're just rude. These guys took it to another level.''</p>
        <p>The woman received some of the calls at her office, a spokeswoman there said. Distraught, she informed her boss, who asked investigators for the Labor Department's inspector general to trace her calls. That led to Mr. Chittenden's home and the office of Tri-City Funding in Clifton Park, the police said.</p>
        <p>Neither man works at Tri-City any longer, according to Joseph Zappone, a lawyer representing the company. He would not say whether their departures were tied to the charges, but said that Tri-City officials had no knowledge of any harassment.</p>
        <p>''It is not our business practice to use aggressive business tactics in any way, shape or form,'' Mr. Zappone said.</p>
