        <p>The Times has revised its stock market tables, listing prices in dollars and cents rather than in fractions.</p>
        <p>The change is being made as the stock markets move toward quoting prices of stocks and options in decimals, beginning with tests next week.</p>
        <p>Until the stocks trade in decimals, The Times will round their fraction prices to two decimal places. For example, 12 5/8, which translates into $12.625, will be expressed as $12.63. Articles that mention a stock price will also round it to two places.</p>
        <p>Comments about the changes may be e-mailed to tables@nytimes.com or telephoned to (212) 556-3123.</p>
