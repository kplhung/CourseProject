        <p>In this society riven by race, the color line has long been crossed only by the most determined of souls. So when Harry F. Oppenheimer was remembered today, here in the small Anglican church where he worshiped for decades, no one had to ask why so many people from such different walks of life had come to pay tribute to a titan of business and industry.</p>
        <p>The Oppenheimers earned much of their fortune in gold, diamonds, minerals and other holdings during the country's darkest days. But more than many of his fellow magnates, Mr. Oppenheimer, who died last Saturday at age 91, was a champion of change. The longtime chairman of the world's biggest mining companies, Anglo American and De Beers, and one of the world's richest men, Mr. Oppenheimer opposed apartheid and pushed for an end to the oppression of blacks.</p>
        <p>This morning, cabinet ministers and corporate chiefs, black and white, made their way to St. George's Church in the city's Parktown neighborhood, filing in alongside ordinary employees and parishioners who also felt themselves touched at one time or another by the man affectionately known as Harry O.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oppenheimer was far from a revolutionary, and he often found himself at odds with those who were -- namely, the outlawed African National Congress. But in the end many in the country, including leaders of the liberation struggle, judged him to have been a friend of their fight.</p>
        <p>''He played an important role, from a different type of trench,'' said Cyril Ramaphosa, who was secretary general of the African National Congress during the early 1990's. ''His trench was not the struggle, the armed struggle. It was in the boardroom.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramaphosa said that the business success that Mr. Oppenheimer achieved should not discount the enormous contribution he made to the country's evolution.</p>
        <p>''There will always be questions of whether, in the process of making his money, whether it was advanced through the help of apartheid,'' Mr. Ramaphosa said. ''My answer to that is he operated in the time and he did well in advancing he causes of many people.''</p>
        <p>Bobby Godsell, one of the Anglo American Corporation's top executives, said the collective complexion of the people who had shown up signified the place Mr. Oppenheimer held in South African life.</p>
        <p>''It says a lot about him and it says a lot about where the society we live in has come from,'' Mr. Godsell said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oppenheimer championed the creation of black trade unions and was influential in ending an employment system that set aside certain jobs for whites only. He also developed programs to bring blacks into positions of responsibility in his companies.</p>
        <p>One person who came to know Mr. Oppenheimer's good works was Isabel Louw, a 60-year-old black woman who was a parishioner at St. George's in the 1960's and 1970's. She was one of those people who benefited from his generosity and so she, too, came today to pay her respects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oppenheimer, she recalled, had helped her son with a scholarship to college in Cape Town, and later the family helped him land a job at the company in spite of his student activism, which made him a target of state security agents.</p>
        <p>''He was very nice, and he always was helping,'' she said. ''He was rich man, but he wasn't a boaster.''</p>
