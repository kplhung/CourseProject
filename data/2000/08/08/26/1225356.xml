        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak has warned of ''a tragedy'' ahead for Israel and the Palestinians if they fail to reach a peace agreement, and has hinted that he fears a return to the Islamic terrorist attacks that killed scores of Israelis in the mid-1990's.</p>

        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak has warned of ''a tragedy'' ahead for Israel and the Palestinians if they fail to reach a peace agreement, and has hinted that he fears a return to the Islamic terrorist attacks that killed scores of Israelis in the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>In an interview published today in Yediot Ahronot, Israel's most widely circulated newspaper, Mr. Barak said he could not predict whether a peace pact could be reached with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. But he said whatever chance there was of an agreement on Jerusalem and other contentious issues was now up to Mr. Arafat showing ''flexibility and openness'' that was not forthcoming at the Camp David talks that foundered last month.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if there will be an agreement, but I am sure there should be one,'' Mr. Barak said. ''I am sure the alternative is tragedy. It would not be appropriate to go into detail as to what could happen later on.'' At another point, he noted that within the past 18 months -- roughly the period since he campaigned for and won Israel's May 1999 election on a pledge to push assertively for peace with the Palestinians -- there had been no major terrorist attacks on Israelis.</p>
        <p>Alluding to mounting pressure from opposition parties for a new election later this year or early next year, Mr. Barak said that, if forced to go to the polls again, he would campaign on the peace offer he made to Mr. Arafat at Camp David. That offer included concessions on Jerusalem and other issues. A new opinion poll published today in Yediot Ahronot showed a continuing erosion of public confidence in Mr. Barak, showing only 33 percent of the respondents rated his performance as prime minister as ''good'' and 64 percent as ''not good.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Barak predicted he would win an election, because most Israelis know the potential consequences of abandoning the peace effort.</p>
        <p>He said that if the Israeli Parliament calls for new elections, as many politicians expect, when it returns from its summer recess on Oct. 29, ''I will go to the people to ask their trust in continuing to steer the helm of the peace process, and I tell you that this trust will be given, because we are now faced with dramatic decisions. With a year and a half having passed without a terror attack, whoever closes the road to an accord is taking a heavy responsibility on themselves.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Barak returned empty-handed from Camp David on July 25, his government was in serious disarray. His ruling coalition had already lost its parliamentary majority before he left for Washington when two ultra-Orthodox parties quit the government in disagreement over the peace effort. His political position was further weakened after his return, when Parliament rejected the government's candidate for the Israeli presidency, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, in favor of a little-known candidate, Moshe Katsav, of the main opposition Likud Party. Parliament then voted for a new election, but recessed immediately for the summer before the bill could become law, which would have required approval by a parliamentary committee and a second vote by the full Parliament.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, in the past week, Mr. Barak has gone on the political offensive. First, he stunned his own Labor Party by announcing that he planned a ''secular revolution'' that would strip the Jewish religious establishment of legal powers and privileges accumulated over Israel's 52-year history. On Wednesday, he challenged Likud to join the ''march'' to a more secular state by forming a new Labor-Likud government of national unity, similar to one that ruled in the 1980's. He suggested that such a government could be formed within ''a few weeks'' if the peace effort, vigorously opposed by Likud, falters.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Barak appears to have found renewed confidence in his peace proposals, even as the impasse with the Palestinians shows no sign of easing. When he landed back in Tel Aviv from Camp David, he described the concessions he had tentatively accepted in Washington, including a limited Palestinian foothold in East Jerusalem, as ''null and void'' because Mr. Arafat had rejected them and demanded full Palestinian sovereignty over all of East Jerusalem. But if this suggested that Mr. Barak was preparing to draw back from the Camp David proposals, the interview with Yediot Ahronot today suggested the opposite.</p>
        <p>Shlomo Ben-Ami, the acting foreign minister, who was a key aide to Mr. Barak at Camp David, told reporters today in Jerusalem that far from rejecting the proposals put forward by President Clinton at Camp David, and tentatively accepted by Mr. Barak, Israel now wanted the proposals codified in a ''collective paper.'' Such a document would have to be agreed on by Israel and the Palestinians and set out exactly what was proposed and what was rejected at Camp David. ''We must work on the basis of what was created at Camp David, and not return to square one,'' Mr. Ben-Ami said.</p>
        <p>The change did not appear to reflect any new confidence by Mr. Barak that Mr. Arafat will accept the Camp David proposals, or any modification that might be acceptable to Mr. Barak. After Camp David, Mr.  Arafat used a 20-nation tour of Europe, the Middle East and Asia to round up support in the Arab and Muslim worlds for his refusal to accept anything less than the return of all of East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Although he failed to get backing for his plan to make a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state on Sept. 13 -- even from the Palestinians' closest allies like Egypt and Russia -- Mr. Arafat lined up fairly solid support for his position on Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>According to reports in the Palestinian press, Mr. Arafat, in his diplomatic encounters since Camp David, has used strong invective against the Israelis, and Mr. Barak in particular, accusing them of ''lies'' in depicting Mr. Arafat as the spoiler at Camp David -- a view seemingly shared by President Clinton, who said at the time that he had found Mr. Barak more ''creative'' in seeking solutions. In the interview today, Mr. Barak hit back, saying that there was ''a great deal of misunderstanding and lack of knowledge'' among Arabs, and in particular Palestinians, over the most sensitive of all issues in the conflicting claims for East Jerusalem -- Haram al Sharif, called the Temple Mount by Jews.</p>
        <p>For Jews, the Temple Mount is the most sacred of all places, the site, according to Jewish beliefs, of the first and second temples destroyed by the Babylonians and Romans. Among Muslims, the site, and its two Muslim shrines, the Dome of the Rock and Al Aksa, are among the holiest of all Islamic sites. At Camp David, Mr. Barak tentatively agreed to proposals that would have granted religious sovereignty over the Mount to the Palestinians, but retained Israeli political sovereignty.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Barak complained that Mr. Arafat was distorting the issue by suggesting that the Israeli position masked a desire to dig up the foundations of the old temples, and to use the findings as a grounds for usurping the Muslim claim. ''Arafat has created the impression in the Arab world as if we were demanding sovereignty over the Temple Mount in order to dig up the temple,'' Mr. Barak said. ''But we know the reverse: Our faith prevents us from digging there. We want to ensure an arrangement where no one digs for the temple, not even the Muslims.''</p>
