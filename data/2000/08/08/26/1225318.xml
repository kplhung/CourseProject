        <p>IMAGINE a meeting that put Israel's chief rabbi, an emissary of Iran's top ayatollah, the head of the World Council of Churches and a granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi together in the same room. An unexpected grouping, to be sure. But it would have only a few of the spiritual figures due to begin meeting at the United Nations on Monday, when 2,000 people from 90 nations and a wide spectrum of faiths gather to spend four days on issues related to peace.</p>
        <p>''There's a unique opportunity for religious leaders to have an impact on the political process,'' said Bawa Jain, a veteran of interfaith activities who is general secretary of the event, the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jain, 44, an Indian native and United States citizen who lives in New Jersey, has traveled widely, asking prominent people in the worlds of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and other faiths to attend.</p>
        <p>The meeting, backed by a large advisory board filled with religious figures, scholars and diplomats, has been organized in cooperation with the office of the United Nations secretary general. But it is not an official United Nations event, and its financing has come largely from foundations.</p>
        <p>In terms of its breadth, the event is not unique. At meetings in South Africa last year and in Chicago in 1993, the Parliament of the World's Religions drew wide interfaith participation.</p>
        <p>But it may be, as Mr. Jain said, the biggest in terms of the high level of leadership involved. Among its goals is the creation of an advisory council of religious leaders to work with the United Nations.</p>
        <p>What seems to have helped in attracting participants are the event's location, at the United Nations; its timing, in the year 2000; and its focus on peace. Five hundred delegates are coming, many with associates as well.</p>
        <p>In addition to the religious figures mentioned above -- Rabbi Meir Lau, from Israel; Ayatollah Abdollah Vaeze Javadi, from Iran; the Rev. Konrad Raiser of the World Council of Churches; and Ela Gandhi -- those attending are to include Cardinal Francis Arinze, a Vatican official representing Pope John Paul II; Kuni Kuniaki, high priest of Shintoism's Grand Shrine at Ise, Japan; and Bishop Vashti McKenzie, the first woman to be a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>
        <p>(One major figure not attending is the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of Tibet, whose presence at the United Nations was blocked by objections from China, casting a shadow over the proceedings.)</p>
        <p>MR. JAIN belongs to the Jain faith (it is not at all unusual, he said, for believers to carry its name as their own). It originated in India and espouses ahimsa, or nonviolence toward all living creatures.</p>
        <p>He is vice president of the Interfaith Center in New York, an organization headed by the Rev. James Parks Morton, retired dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Morton spoke of Sushil Kumar, Mr. Jain's spiritual mentor, who was long active in promoting dialogue among religious groups. ''All of the big, international interfaith conferences I attended, he was there,'' Mr. Morton said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jain said Mr. Kumar had a religious vision as a 7-year-old in India, was ordained a Jain monk at 15 and was deeply affected by the violence between Hindus and Muslims that marred the independence of India and Pakistan half a century ago. Mr. Kumar, he said, pursued interfaith activities as a way of improving relations between adherents of different religions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kumar came to the United States in 1975 and, six years later, found a site for the area's first Jain temple, on property once occupied by a Jewish summer camp in Blairstown, N.J. Mr. Jain, then running a construction company in India, supplied craftsmen for the project. Before his death in 1994, Mr. Kumar asked Mr. Jain to take a lead in interfaith efforts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jain said the process culminating in the  event next week had originated in a conversation between Ted Turner and Secretary General Kofi Annan. Mr. Turner suggested that religious leaders ought to come together to promote world peace, Mr. Jain said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jain said a United Nations official had asked him to get involved, after which he sought assistance from David Finn, founder and chairman of Ruder-Finn, a public relations company in New York. Mr. Finn's daughter Dena Merriam, a Ruder-Finn partner and vice chairman who works with religious and cultural organizations, joined in, lining up foundation support.</p>
        <p>The event's advisory board has more than 40 people, including the Roman Catholic theologian Hans Kung. Its chairman is Maurice Strong, an adviser to Mr. Annan who organized the Earth Summit in Brazil in 1992.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jain said he found inspiration for the event in the memory of Mr. Kumar.</p>
        <p>''It's his blessing,'' Mr. Jain said.</p>
        <p>PUBLIC LIVES  Correction:  October 4, 2000, Wednesday  A Public Lives profile on Aug. 26 about Bawa Jain, general secretary of the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, held at the United Nations, referred incorrectly to David Finn, whose company helped organize it.  He is a co-founder of Ruder Finn public relations, with William Ruder -- not the sole founder. A reader's letter dated Sept. 13 pointed out the error; this correction was delayed by an editing lapse.</p>
