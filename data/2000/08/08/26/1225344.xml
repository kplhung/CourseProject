        <p>As she came out of the final turn, Beautiful Pleasure swung wide, awfully wide, enough to allow her rival Heritage of Gold an opening to run her down for the third time this year. More was at stake today than the Personal Ensign Handicap at Saratoga Race Course. The move endangered Beautiful Pleasure's title as the champion mare.</p>
        <p>Heritage of Gold had cut Beautiful Pleasure's five-length lead in half, and now Shane Sellers guided his mare to the rail and urged her to go by, as she did four weeks ago here in the Go for Wand, as she did in April at the Apple Blossom Handicap in Arkansas. But on the far outside of the track, Jorge Chavez slapped Beautiful Pleasure, the mare he has ridden to seven victories and the 1999 Eclipse Award, in an easy rhythmic motion, asking for a final burst.</p>

        <p>As she came out of the final turn, Beautiful Pleasure swung wide, awfully wide, enough to allow her rival Heritage of Gold an opening to run her down for the third time this year. More was at stake today than the Personal Ensign Handicap at Saratoga Race Course. The move endangered Beautiful Pleasure's title as the champion mare.</p>
        <p>Heritage of Gold had cut Beautiful Pleasure's five-length lead in half, and now Shane Sellers guided his mare to the rail and urged her to go by, as she did four weeks ago here in the Go for Wand, as she did in April at the Apple Blossom Handicap in Arkansas. But on the far outside of the track, Jorge Chavez slapped Beautiful Pleasure, the mare he has ridden to seven victories and the 1999 Eclipse Award, in an easy rhythmic motion, asking for a final burst.</p>
        <p>Beautiful Pleasure answered, speeding down the stretch for a five-length victory in 2:03.77 and ensuring that she and Heritage of Gold would meet again in the Breeders' Cup with the championship at stake.</p>
        <p>''Her crown hasn't fallen off yet,'' said Donna Ward, who trains Beautiful Pleasure with her husband, John.</p>
        <p>Just as in the Go for Wand, Chavez and Beautiful Pleasure were allowed to lope along in the lead at their own pace. But in that race, Heritage of Gold collared her in the stretch and then blew past her. That was not the case today. Sellers did not feel the power beneath him and Heritage of Gold struggled to finish the race of a mile and a quarter. In fact, Heritage of Gold was nipped at the wire by Back in Shape but was placed second by the racing stewards after they determined that Jerry Bailey had impeded Pentatonic, who was third, in a meandering stretch drive. Back in Shape was placed fourth.</p>
        <p>By capturing the $400,000 Grade I race and the $240,000 first-place check, Beautiful Pleasure pushed her career earnings past $2.5 million, though her backers were rewarded with only $3.80 for a $2 bet to win on the heavy favorite.</p>
