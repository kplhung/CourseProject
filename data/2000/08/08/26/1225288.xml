        <p>Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer is pessimistic about the eradication of rightist extremism in the east of Germany. It will take a ''generation and a half,'' he said, to overcome the wounds of an area that reminds him of his youth ''in the twilight zone'' between democracy and authoritarian tradition.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Fischer said the anti-immigrant violence that has become the chief focus of German political debate in the last month is not confined to eastern Germany.</p>
        <p>But the fact that the postwar decades saw ''no development of civil society'' in the east when it was under Communist rule left that area more vulnerable to neo-Nazism, he said.</p>
        <p>''I remember growing up in the 1950's and we were in this twilight zone between democracy and the Nazi heritage,'' said the foreign minister, who is from western Germany. ''And now I go to to the east and I feel I am back in my youth. Not only the landscapes, but also the minds. And so there is a potential for neo-Nazi ideas among a small minority, but a very violent one.''</p>
        <p>A bomb in the western city of Dusseldorf that wounded nine immigrants, six of them Jews, and a spate of anti-immigrant slurs or attacks in the east led Mr. Fischer to a much-noticed statement this month in which he deplored German ''passivity'' in the face of xenophobia. ''We need a reaction,'' he reiterated in the interview.</p>
        <p>Asked if he saw a danger of rightist terrorist groups emerging, a sort of ''Brown Army Faction'' that would parallel the Red Army Faction of the 1970's, Mr. Fischer said such a possibility was being watched ''very carefully.''</p>
        <p>The foreign minister, a leader of the Green Party and a man who has made a long personal journey from anti-American protester in the 1970's to staunch defender of Atlanticism today, said he was divided about the idea of banning the rightist National Democratic Party, which has been identified with violent extremists.</p>
        <p>''I am split,'' the minister said. ''I am a radical supporter of free speech. But freedom of speech is one thing in America, and another here in Germany.''</p>
        <p>He explained that in the light of Germany's Nazi past, neo-Nazi movements could not be viewed as they might be in another Western country. Extra severity is needed, he said, as demonstrated by the fact that the selling of Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' is illegal here but not in the United States.</p>
        <p>Pressed about whether banning the National Democratic Party was appropriate, Mr. Fischer said there was evidence that the youth organization of the party provided ''the organizational cells for many of these violent acts.''</p>
        <p>He continued, ''Yes, I am split, but if the facts are sufficient, then the ban must be done.''</p>
        <p>Although the government can recommend a ban, any decision would ultimately be made by the Constitutional Court. Many analysts say barring the party would merely force its supporters into other rightist groups.</p>
        <p>Claus Leggewie, a political scientist close to the Greens, said: ''A ban is not good policy. It is ridiculous and would be counterproductive. What is needed are vigils, demonstrations, by hundreds of thousands of people, like those we had when the first anti-immigrant attacks occurred in the early 1990's.''</p>
        <p>But since then, Germany seems to have grown used to the occasional racist violence that unification has brought. Overcoming the problem will take time, Mr. Fischer said. ''How long did it take to close the wounds of the Civil War in America?'' he asked. ''Here we certainly need one and a half generations.''</p>
        <p>The minister said he was appalled that some of the people calling themselves German nationalists could identify with the Nazi movement. ''Every German patriot must hate Hitler,'' he said. ''He destroyed our country, destroyed our culture. Here in Berlin you feel it. He destroyed the Jewish culture that had been very important for our identity and history. He destroyed the German minorities in Eastern Europe.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fischer's own family was among those German minorities -- the millions of ethnic Germans in Eastern Europe driven from their homes after World War II. His family fled in 1946 from near Budapest, where they had lived for two centuries.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Mr. Fischer suggested, Europe's wounds would be healed by the unification of the continent. Comparing Europe's integration with that of the United States, he said, ''We are passing the phase of the Confederation and entering the period of the constitutional process and federalism.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Either Europe will have a weak central body and a confederation of independent states, and that will not work. Or we will move ahead to a real European constitution and a new European central body.''</p>
        <p>Asked what would be governed by the individual nations of the European Union and what by the central body -- in effect, a European government -- Mr. Fischer declined to give details, but said, ''Very important parts of sovereign decisions should be transferred to the central body.''</p>
