        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman accused Gov. George W. Bush today of distorting the Democrats' tax cut proposal, saying it was time for ''an honest debate'' on the subject.</p>
        <p>Making his first solo campaign foray as Vice President Al Gore's running mate, Mr. Lieberman sought to take advantage of the trouble Mr. Bush has had in selling his tax cut plan, a central plank in his platform. The governor has proposed an across-the-board tax cut totaling about $1.3 trillion over the next decade, while the vice president has called for a targeted $500 billion tax cut package.</p>
        <p>With polls showing that Americans are not clamoring for tax relief in a time of prosperity, Mr. Bush said this week that he had done a poor job of explaining his plan. To that end, he appeared on Thursday in New Orleans with the Bechac family, an in-the-flesh example of who, he said, would save money under his plan, but not under Mr. Gore's.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lieberman, who appeared before 300 cheering supporters at a community center here, contended that the Bechac family could save money under Mr. Gore's plan, and he pointed to an article in today's Wall Street Journal to support his contention. The article said the Bechacs could benefit under Mr. Gore's plan if they took advantage of college and retirement savings programs Mr. Gore has proposed.</p>
        <p>''Our opponents' problem is they can't explain away the facts,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''I think it's good to have a debate on taxes, but it has to be an honest debate that accurately tells the American people what we would do.</p>
        <p>''Governor Bush said that he had to do a better job of explaining his plan. With all due respect, the problem isn't explaining the plan. The problem is the plan itself.''</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, argued that the two proposals were not comparable, because the Gore plan would require families to set aside money in approved savings accounts for retirement and college to reap most of the tax benefits.</p>
        <p>''You have to take a significant step before you're even eligible for Al Gore's tax relief,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''The clear difference here is under Governor Bush's plan it's plain and simple. You get a tax cut automatically and immediately.''</p>
        <p>The vice president's plan, he said, would benefit mainly accountants and lawyers who he said would be needed to guide people through its provisions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's remarks today were his sharpest yet at the Republican ticket, as he feels his way into the vice-presidential nominee's traditional role as his party's attacker. He has shown -- especially in his successful 1988 campaign to unseat Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in Connecticut -- that he can be relentless and effective on the offensive.</p>
        <p>The Democrats clearly see the tax issue as working to their advantage, and not just because Mr. Bush struggled this week to defend his plan. Cutting against the Republican orthodoxy that deep tax cuts are both good policy and good politics, Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman have attacked the Bush plan as a threat to the nation's economic health that would benefit mainly the rich.</p>
        <p>Andrew Bechac makes about $40,000 a year as a teacher, and his wife, Margaret, stays home in Mandeville, La., with their two girls. Under Mr. Bush's proposals to award a tax credit of $500 per child and to reduce the lowest bracket to 10 percent from 15 percent, their federal income tax bill would drop to less than $500, a savings of about $1,600.</p>
        <p>The Bechacs said they were saving for both college and retirement. Under Mr. Gore's plan, they could put up to $2,000 a year into approved savings accounts for those purposes -- which the Gore campaign has likened to 401(k) or Roth individual retirement account plans -- and save up to $2,300 on their tax bills.</p>
        <p>Clearly enjoying his new celebrity, Mr. Lieberman rode the train today from Washington to Wilmington, near this old steel town. He strode up and down the aisles, greeted by smiles of recognition from riders.</p>
        <p>One passenger, Lynn Imperiale of Nutley, N.J., said she was talking on her cellular phone with her mother, Marie Stefanelli, who is being treated for breast cancer. Mr. Lieberman took the phone and told Mrs. Stefanelli, ''I'm praying for you.''</p>
