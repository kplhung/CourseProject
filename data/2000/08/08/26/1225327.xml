        <p>Bruce J. Teitelbaum, the chief fund-raiser for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's aborted campaign for United States Senate, is moving to set up an independent committee to tap money from Mr. Giuliani's national network of contributors, and finance television advertisements on behalf of Representative Rick A. Lazio's campaign, said political leaders knowledgeable about the discussions.</p>
        <p>One Republican said it was ''90 percent certain'' that Mr. Teitelbaum would go ahead with creating the committee. Although some details of its structure were still being worked out, the committee would be set up independently of Mr. Lazio, and would be exempt from most restrictions on campaign contributions, one official said.</p>
        <p>As contemplated, the independent committee would provide a much-needed assist for Mr. Lazio, the Suffolk County Republican who entered  the race only three months ago to replace Mr. Giuliani, who is undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has been under intense pressure to raise money fast in order to catch up with his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>The Democratic candidate for Senate has collected $18.6 million, compared with the $8.5 million accumulated by Mr. Lazio, who has said he needs at least $15 million to be competitive in the race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teitelbaum is reported to have  said he thought he could raise several million dollars from the network of Mr. Giuliani's supporters -- or, perhaps more accurately, opponents of Mrs. Clinton. The money would probably go to finance television advertisements and other activities, like a get-out-the-vote drive, one official said.</p>
        <p>That said, there are some risks here for Mr. Lazio. He has repeatedly criticized Mrs. Clinton for what he has described as campaign finance abuses, in particular, her use of so-called so-called soft-money committees to collect largely unregulated contributions.</p>
        <p>With much fanfare, he signed a ''New York Freedom From Soft Money Pact,'' while Mrs. Clinton was collecting soft-money contributions in California. And he has also campaigned with Senator John S. McCain, who has led the effort in Washington to eliminate soft money, and who is expected to make a television advertisement on Mr. Lazio's behalf.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teitelbaum helped Mr. Giuliani raise $23 million before he quit the race, an amount that stunned Mrs. Clinton and her supporters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teitelbaum declined to comment this week. Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, did not return several calls seeking comment on the committee.</p>
        <p>Soft money is largely unregulated contributions raised by political party committees and outside groups. By law, it is not supposed to be used to directly promote a candidacy, but parties in general -- and President Clinton in particular -- have found ways to work around that. Donations to the official campaign committees, like those set up for Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton, are limited to $2,000.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign says she has two soft-money accounts set up with outside committees. Mr. Lazio has none, according to his aides. One official familiar with the negotiations to set up the new committee said that in order to avoid such criticism, the committee being set up would not technically be a soft-money committee, but rather an independent entity that would raise and spend money on its own -- and, at least officially, without Mr. Lazio's knowledge, to make certain that the committee does not run afoul of election laws.</p>
        <p>That said, aides to Mr. Lazio acknowledged this week that they were aware of what Mr. Teitelbaum, and a small group of other Lazio supporters, were trying to do.</p>
        <p>The effort by Mr. Teitelbaum is notable for political, as well as financial, reasons. Until now, Mr. Giuliani has seemed to offer what many Republicans have viewed as perfunctory support for Mr. Lazio, although he did urge his donors to turn over contributions to the congressman.</p>
