        <p>The Jets are expected to make at least some of their final cuts on Saturday, and Coach Al Groh said he used the bye week to scrutinize positions that were especially close. The Jets have to cut nine players to get to the mandatory 53-man roster by Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I got good advice long ago,'' Groh said. ''That was: Don't ever make a major decision any sooner than is necessary. That's not to say procrastinate. If you've got 15 seconds to make a decision in, don't make it in 5. You may find something out in the last 10 seconds.''</p>

        <p>The Jets are expected to make at least some of their final cuts on Saturday, and Coach Al Groh said he used the bye week to scrutinize positions that were especially close. The Jets have to cut nine players to get to the mandatory 53-man roster by Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I got good advice long ago,'' Groh said. ''That was: Don't ever make a major decision any sooner than is necessary. That's not to say procrastinate. If you've got 15 seconds to make a decision in, don't make it in 5. You may find something out in the last 10 seconds.''</p>
        <p>Groh said he would not announce his starters until next week, and he has kept his starter at free safety a secret, even from the three players competing for the spot. Groh has continued to have Omar Stoutmire, Scott Frost and Kevin Williams rotate during practice at the position, even though Groh said he knows who will start.</p>
        <p>Stoutmire, the presumed favorite for the job, did not want to talk about it until the decision was announced. Frost compared the suspense to an episode of ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>''I feel I played well enough in camp to contribute some way on the team this year,'' Frost said. ''I've shown the coaches I can play and I've proven to myself I can play and be a quality safety in the league.</p>
        <p>''Whichever one of us doesn't start is going to play a lot and contribute on special teams, too. It's going to come down to taking the name out of the pot.''</p>
        <p>Work, Work, Work</p>
        <p>Some players have grumbled throughout training camp -- and in some cases since the veterans' minicamp in the spring -- about the length and intensity of Groh's practices. The former coach Bill Parcells, fearing injury, did not believe in grueling practices during camp. Apparently, Al Groh's policy did not change during this bye week.</p>
        <p>The players practiced twice on Wednesday, and linebacker Marvin Jones said practices were, in some cases, even tougher this week. Groh also scheduled a practice for Saturday, unusual in a bye week.</p>
        <p>Cox Is Mostly Quiet</p>
        <p>Linebacker Bryan Cox apparently meant it when he said last week that he was not talking to the news media this season. The usually voluble Cox said he made his decision after talking to his mother, who told him to ''shut up and do my job.''</p>
        <p>Cox, perhaps not coincidentally, decided to keep quiet after he had a loud argument with the defensive line coach, Ray Hamilton, in front of reporters on the last day in which practices were open to the public. Hamilton has also not spoken about the incident, in which Cox had to be pushed away from Hamilton by Mo Lewis and Victor Green.</p>
        <p>This week, Cox and Lewis, who has grown increasingly distant from reporters in recent years, engaged in something of a vaudeville act when reporters approached.</p>
        <p>''Hey, Mo, what's our comment?'' Cox began.</p>
        <p>Lewis: ''No comment.''</p>
        <p>Cox: ''That's right, no comment. Me and Mo are on the same page.''</p>
        <p>Lewis: ''I'll tell you off the record, though. No comment.''</p>
        <p>Cox to reporters: ''Your go-to guy has left the building.''</p>
