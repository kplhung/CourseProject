        <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a gay Mexican man who dresses and acts like a woman is entitled to asylum in the United States, expanding the circumstances that immigration officials must consider when foreigners ask to stay in the country.</p>
        <p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which covers the Western part of the country, ruled on Thursday that Geovanni Hernandez-Montiel should be granted asylum. A three-judge panel sitting in Pasadena, Calif., unanimously overruled an immigration judge and members of an immigration appeals board, who had said he should be deported.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hernandez-Montiel, who is in his early 20's, told of repeated assaults and taunts by the Mexican police before he fled to the United States in 1995. Testifying for Mr. Hernandez-Montiel, an expert on Latin American history said gay men who dressed and acted like women were often singled out for cruel treatment in Mexico.</p>
        <p>The Immigration and Naturalization Service has occasionally granted asylum to foreigners who claimed they were persecuted because of their sexual orientation. But Mr. Hernandez-Montiel's lawyer, Robert S. Gerber of San Diego, said he thought this case was the first in which an appeals court held that sexual orientation could be grounds for asylum because the applicant merits protection as a member of a ''particular social group.''</p>
        <p>The immigration agency has not decided whether to appeal, Bill Strassberger, a spokesman, said today. But Mr. Strassberger said the agency usually did not contest Circuit Court rulings unless government lawyers thought the judges had committed a serious error.</p>
        <p>The term ''particular social group'' comes from United Nations deliberations on the treatment of refugees and refers to those who share common traits that have caused them to be persecuted. These can range from fundamental characteristics like sex, color and ethnic background to biographical details like military service or land ownership.</p>
        <p>Whether an asylum seeker is a member of such a group is decided by immigration officials on a case-by-case basis. As the circuit court judges noted, the definition of ''particular social group'' is evolving. Generally speaking, the immigration agency says the traits that constitute membership in a particular social group must be ones that a person cannot change, or should not have to change because they are fundamental to a sense of identity or conscience.</p>
        <p>''We conclude as a matter of law that gay men with female sexual identities in Mexico constitute a 'particular social group,' '' the court ruled in a decision written by Judge A. Wallace Tashima.</p>
        <p>An immigration judge and appeals board had found Mr. Hernandez-Montiel's account of ostracism by his family and persecution by school officials, the Mexican police and ordinary Mexicans to be sincere and credible.</p>
        <p>But the judge and board rejected arguments that Mr. Hernandez-Montiel was persecuted because of membership in a particular group. They also were skeptical of his claims that his traits were ''immutable.'' Perhaps, it was suggested, he could just dress differently.</p>
        <p>Circuit court judges rejected that reasoning. ''This case is about sexual identity, not fashion,'' Judge Tashima wrote in the ruling, in which he was joined by Judges Melvin Brunetti and William S. Schwarzer.</p>
