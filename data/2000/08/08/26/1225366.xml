        <p>About 1,100 lobstermen from New York and Connecticut filed a federal lawsuit yesterday charging that pesticides sprayed last year to kill mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus have devastated the lobster population in Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Central Islip, N.Y., seeks at least $125 million from five pesticide manufacturers. They are accused of disregarding the likelihood that their products would seep into coastal waters and kill marine life.</p>
        <p>While the lawsuit acknowledges that New York State, Connecticut, New York City and Suffolk County used the pesticides to fight the spread of the West Nile virus, it does not accuse any public officials of wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit says lobstermen have witnessed a ''dramatic and severe'' decrease in the number of lobsters in Long Island Sound. This decrease, the suit maintains, began immediately after heavy rains washed the pesticides into the sound.</p>
        <p>Laura McGowan, a spokeswoman for Clarke Mosquito Control Products Inc. of Roselle, Ill., one of the defendants, said she had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it. Representatives of the other pesticide manufacturers named in the suit could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>They are Cheminova Inc. of Wayne, N.J.; its parent, Cheminova Agro A/S of Denmark; Agrevo Environmental Health Inc., which has headquarters in Frankfurt; and Zoecon Corporation of Schaumburg, Ill.</p>
        <p>Gladstone N. Jones, the lead lawyer for the lobstermen, said the spraying of pesticides wiped out about 90 percent of last year's full-grown lobster population. Mr. Jones also said the pesticides had killed many young and larval lobsters, meaning that the lobster harvest in the sound could be damaged for 5 to 10 more years.</p>
        <p>He added that the lobstermen had chosen to sue the pesticide manufacturers because they were in the best position to warn government officials of the dangers of their products. ''They had the information in their control that in all likelihood, this fishery would be wiped out,'' Mr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones also pointed out that like insects, lobsters are arthropods and are particularly susceptible to pesticides.</p>
