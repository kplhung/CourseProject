        <p>WHEN Joe Dumars III was 15, his father of the same name sat him down one night inside the little brick house on Martin Luther King Street in Natchitoches, La., and said, ''I'm going to bring you out and let you see what the real world is like.''</p>
        <p>It was family tradition, a rite of passing, father and son heading out at dawn in the 18-wheeler, making the cross-country run from one Kroger supermarket to another.</p>
        <p>''When you're 15, you want to impress your father with how strong you are,'' Dumars once said. ''I'm grabbing the bags, just slinging them the first two, three stops. He never said a word. Just looked at me and smiled.''</p>
        <p>Hard work with a hearty attitude would become the trademark of the teenager's 14-year pro basketball career. When late-night celebrity was suddenly as available to the All-Star-caliber player as 100 cable channels, Dumars would click right past Arsenio and rest on Charlie Rose. He and his backcourt opposite, Isiah Thomas, were the pillars of two championship seasons in Detroit, but Dumars, the quiet and dignified star for whom they have named the league's sportsmanship trophy, has fittingly remained at the helm.</p>
        <p>In all likelihood, the first place the Pistons will go now is into free fall, after Grant Hill packed his coatless bag for Doc Rivers's magic kingdom in Orlando, just as Dumars took front-office control. In an era of the one-size-fits-all superstar contract, when the highest bid has been displaced by the most verdant view of the 18th green, Dumars can only offer a Palace in a parking lot, a half-hour from chilly, gritty Detroit.</p>
        <p>This is what the real sports world is like and, upon reflection, the trade that would have sent Patrick Ewing to Seattle earlier this week represented much of what ails it. David Falk and company pulled off a deal that had an odious and collusive quality, until one blue-collar Joe responded to a fan outcry and wisely pulled the plug.</p>
        <p>''The other three teams in that deal were making out pretty good,'' Dumars said.</p>
        <p>The needy SuperSonics would have received the gimpy but still capable Ewing, along with a token of the agent Falk's appreciation in the person of the free agent Maurice Taylor. For sending another Falk client, Glen Rice, to New York with a hefty new contract he would not get elsewhere, the Lakers would have landed the Pistons' power forward Christian Laettner, as well as the backup center Chris Dudley, to mimic Shaq in the middle and on the free-throw line. The Knicks would have reeled in Rice and the enigmatic Vin Baker, providing depth to facilitate a trade for another big man, perhaps the Falk client Dikembe Mutombo.</p>
        <p>From both coasts, from the entertainment centers and ranking television markets, this made perfect sense. It sounded right. Except Dumars was about to receive an assembly line of bricklayers and bunglers, and he realized he couldn't sell future cap room to restless patrons. When he reportedly asked the Knicks to send him even one useful player, Marcus Camby, the deal was suddenly off, Ewing didn't have a way out, Rice didn't have a deal and Falk, for once, didn't have his way.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner and baseball's other heavy wallets never worry about such elaborate schemes. With no salary cap, they just sign away the game's financial stability and competitive balance. The result is that even a team such as Arizona, boasting a fairly crowded new ballpark and a division title after two major league seasons, has to borrow money to keep competitive pace.</p>
        <p>Their annual playoff runs say the Knicks did not hang on to Ewing too long, but they took on a paralyzing debt in the quest to salvage one title with him. And just as they realized they had lost ground again in the Eastern Conference, here came Falk to bail them out of a bind, in the process of securing Ewing's next financial score. Then Dumars ruined everything.</p>
        <p>Falk, of course, would never think of threatening a general manager who won't play ball with a future ban on his client. Attracting star free agents, even a homegrown one such as Chris Webber, will nonetheless be a trickier task for Dumars than slinging a produce bag.</p>
        <p>With patience, with the right trade and draft moves, he could yet succeed in remaking the Pistons, the way Donnie Walsh has done it in Indiana, the way Don Nelson is doing it in Dallas. The system rewards patience and prudence. It'll be hard work, a long haul. Joe Dumars did not have to prove he was the right man for the job this week, but he did, anyway.</p>
        <p>Last thought on the trade: good for him.</p>
