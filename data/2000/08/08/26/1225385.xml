        <p>Monica Seles, still trying to regain the form that made her one of the dominant women's players in the early 1990's, and Venus Williams, the reigning Wimbledon champion, won today to set up a showdown between the top two seeded players in Saturday's final of the Pilot Pen tournament.</p>
        <p>The second-seeded Seles, the winner of nine Grand Slam titles but none since 1996, recovered to beat the veteran Nathalie Tauziat, 2-6, 6-2, 6-1, this afternoon at the Connecticut Tennis Center. Tonight, the top-seeded Williams, who has won her last three tournaments and 18 matches in a row, defeated Amanda Coetzer, the fifth-seeded player, 6-3, 6-4, in the second semifinal.</p>
        <p>Williams has beaten Seles in all three of their previous meetings, including a final two weeks ago in San Diego, when Williams was extended to three sets before defeating Seles, 6-0, 6-7 (3), 6-3.</p>
        <p>At 5 feet 2 inches and 120 pounds, the 28-year-old Coetzer gave away 11 inches and 40 pounds to Williams. And where Williams is a power hitter, Coetzer is a counterpuncher whose only chance tonight, she conceded before the match, was to induce errors. She did that, since Williams committed 26 unforced errors. But Williams compensated for those errors with 26 winners, 2 aces and about a dozen service winners.</p>
        <p>Coetzer took a 3-2 lead in the first set on a service break in the fifth game. But she could never break Williams's serve again and was broken three times under Williams's withering ground-stroke assault.</p>
        <p>The 32-year-old Tauziat had never won a set from the 26-year-old Seles in nine previous meetings. But she took advantage of a slow start by Seles and won the opening set by breaking Seles's serve in the first and third games while saving break points in the second and fourth games. Seles committed 15 unforced errors in the first set.</p>
        <p>Seles, who has won three tournaments this year and is ranked sixth in the world, got stronger and steadier as the match progressed while Tauziat gradually faltered.</p>
