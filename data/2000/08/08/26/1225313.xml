        <p>California Company Victim Of a Fake Press Release  A fake press release sent over financial news wires set off a 60 percent decline in the shares of Emulex, a California company that makes fiber optic communications equipment. The price recovered after the company disclosed the hoax and said its business was flourishing. Government and financial agencies are investigating the fake release.</p>
        <p>The apparent motive for the fraud was to cause shares of Emulex to fall, enabling someone to profit by buying put options or selling the stock short. Put options rise in value when a company's stock falls; short-selling is another way to profit from price dips. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Dow Jumps 9 Points, to 11,292.63  Stocks were mixed after new economic data suggested that the Fed might not have to raise interest rates further. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 9.89 points, to 11,292.63. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.85 points, to 1,506.46; and the Nasdaq slipped 10.60 points, to 4,042.68. [C2.]</p>
        <p>U.S. Growth Put at 5.3% Pace  The economy grew in the second quarter at a 5.3 percent annual rate, as consumer spending increased at the slowest pace in three years and businesses built up inventories. Sales of existing homes fell 9.8 percent in July, to an annualized rate of 4.79 million. [C14.]</p>
        <p>Concern About European Inflation  European central bankers remain worried about inflation and the weak value of the euro, and analysts say the concern heralds an interest rate increase next week. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Tire Charges Possible in Venezuela  An official of Venezuela's state consumer protection agency said he would submit a report to the government that might result in criminal charges against Ford Motor and Firestone over the companies' handling of defective tires on Ford Explorers. The United States government is investigating at least 62 deaths linked to Firestone tires, most on Ford's popular Explorer sport utility vehicle. The Ford Explorer has been one of the best-selling models of cars in Venezuela in recent years, popular among affluent Venezuelans for its combination of ruggedness and luxury features. [C2.]</p>
        <p>The Japanese tire maker Bridgestone said it earned 18.9 billion yen, or $176.6 million, in the first half of the year, down 48.5 percent from the period a year earlier, because of costs related to its extensive tire recall in the United States. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Chief Executive at Azurix Resigns  Rebecca Mark resigned from her positions as chairwoman and chief executive of Azurix, a Houston-based water and waste-water treatment company, just a year after the company was spun off by Enron. [C3.]</p>
