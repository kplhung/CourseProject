        <p>A 17-year-old was arrested yesterday afternoon and accused of igniting a Brooklyn stable fire in June that killed 21 horses and sent 30-foot flames soaring into the night sky, the police said.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Frank Esposito, was charged with arson, reckless endangerment, 21 counts of animal cruelty, and marijuana possession, the police said, adding that the fire apparently started while he was smoking marijuana. According to a statement he made to the police, Mr. Esposito stopped by the century-old Bergen Beach Stables in Mill Basin on June 10 to have a smoke, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman. It was a muggy Saturday night, and as Mr. Esposito puffed away, he ignited a clump of hay and ''watched it for his amusement,'' Detective Pentangelo said.</p>

        <p>A 17-year-old was arrested yesterday afternoon and accused of igniting a Brooklyn stable fire in June that killed 21 horses and sent 30-foot flames soaring into the night sky, the police said.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Frank Esposito, was charged with arson, reckless endangerment, 21 counts of animal cruelty, and marijuana possession, the police said, adding that the fire apparently started while he was smoking marijuana. According to a statement he made to the police, Mr. Esposito stopped by the century-old Bergen Beach Stables in Mill Basin on June 10 to have a smoke, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman. It was a muggy Saturday night, and as Mr. Esposito puffed away, he ignited a clump of hay and ''watched it for his amusement,'' Detective Pentangelo said.</p>
        <p>After finishing the marijuana cigarette, Mr. Esposito threw the hay aside in the 46-stall wooden barn, then smoked a regular cigarette for a while and tossed that away, Detective Pentangelo said.</p>
        <p>''We believe it contributed to the fire,'' the detective said. ''As he walked away, he could hear the horses stirring.''</p>
        <p>The fire spread quickly through the stables, gutting the inside and shooting pillars of flame through the roof. Smoke billowed into the sky. The barn owner, Karen Facciolo, who had been called by a neighbor, said the middle of the barn ''looked like a volcano.'' Firefighters who arrived on the scene said they could hear horses kicking wildly in their stalls.</p>
        <p>Several firefighters sawed through a wall and rescued two of the 24 horses, including a badly burned pony belonging to Ms. Facciolo. A couple who lived next to the barn rescued another horse by ripping apart the door to its stall.</p>
        <p>But salvation eluded the other horses. Two of them, Belgian draft horses named Jake and Betty, belonged to the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, which was boarding them while they trained for the department's mounted park patrol. Many of the others belonged to families with children who took the horses out for weekend trots and the occasional gallop.</p>
        <p>The day after the fire, Mr. Esposito drove past the charred remains of the barn, the police said.</p>
        <p>''He said he did not realize he was the person responsible for causing the fire,'' Detective Pentangelo said. ''It certainly was reckless. Hay is very volatile; the animals were very vulnerable.''</p>
        <p>On the morning after the fire, Ms. Facciolo stood with several horse owners and watched as the bodies of their prized mounts, some of them weighing as much as 2,000 pounds, were lifted from the smoldering wreckage with forklifts. Children arrived clutching pictures of their horses even as the smell of burning wood and horse flesh wafted through the air.</p>
        <p>The stable, which was built in 1901, was demolished days later. It was the last of three sets of stables near Jamaica Bay, where many residents grew up riding along Bergen Beach or took children to see the horses.</p>
        <p>Police officers and fire marshals began interviewing people in the neighborhood, and that eventually led to Mr. Esposito's arrest, Detective Pentangelo said. He had one previous arrest, on May 29, for spraying graffiti, the detective said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Esposito was in custody last night at the 63rd Precinct. When a call seeking comment was made to his residence on East 57th Street in Brooklyn, a man who answered said: ''No comment, goodbye,'' and hung up.</p>
