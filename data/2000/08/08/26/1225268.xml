        <p>The United States will have three teams competing in the World Olympiad, which begins today in Maastricht, the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Its open team consists of George Jacobs, Ralph Katz, Steve Garner, Howard Weinstein, Larry Cohen and David Berkowitz. The women's team will be a Texas group: Joan Jackson, Petra Hamman, Peggy Sutherlin, Robin Klar, Mildred Breed and Shawn Quinn. The senior team is Kit Woolsey, Steve Robinson, John Sutherlin, John Mohan, Bobby Wolff and Dan Morse.</p>
        <p>The American senior representatives, all of whom have won many American national titles, will be strongly favored to win in Maastricht. They won the Senior Trials in Las Vegas in June, surviving an apparent disaster on the diagramed deal.</p>
        <p>Mohan, North, pushed his opponents to five hearts, which they would have made exactly, but then he bid one spade too many. East and West were Dan and Natalie Hertz of Harrison, N.Y., who were happy to double five spades.</p>
        <p>Sutherlin, South, was helpless against excellent defense. Hearts were led, and on the second round West played the jack as a suit-preference signal for diamonds.</p>
        <p>East led the diamond two, a suit preference signal for clubs, and West duly underled her club ace, allowing East to win and lead a second diamond for another ruff. The spade queen still scored for the defense and the penalty was 1,100.</p>
        <p>East and West naturally expected to gain, but were disappointed. In the replay, the opening bid by West was four hearts, and North not unnaturally tried five diamonds. East was charmed by this development, and his double collected the same 1,100 points, an unusual ''push'' board.</p>
