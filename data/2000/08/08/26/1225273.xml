        <p>The writing of American history underwent a significant change in the 1960's and 70's, one that remains in place today. Not only did the Vietnam War set off a reaction against national institutions, especially the state, but the growth of ''liberation'' movements also led many women, blacks, gays and other groups to demand their own distinctive, ''usable past.'' Increasingly, younger historians shifted their emphasis from the public life of the nation to the private lives of its citizens.</p>
        <p>By the 1980's an explosion of historical categories -- race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality -- had supplanted the more traditional fields of political, diplomatic and intellectual history.  Those formerly on the margins of American society now got the lion's share of attention.</p>
        <p>But critics of the new history have worried about the fragmentation of the past, with each group telling its own story, on its own terms, in its own ''authentic'' voice. And even advocates  wondered at times about the place of these categories in the larger scheme of things. How do they fit together? What does the research tell us about the overall culture or the exercise of power in public life? Where is the framework that connects the parts to the whole?</p>
        <p>In 1994, the prestigious Journal of American History surveyed its members about the state of the profession. Those who responded -- mostly academic historians -- agreed that the greatest improvement in the field was the inclusion of ''more diverse people from the past.'' Yet when asked to list the greatest weaknesses, the respondents placed ''narrowness,'' ''political correctness'' and ''divorce from the public'' at the top of the list. Diversity, it appears, does not come cheap.</p>
        <p>In a biting critique, the journal's respected editor, David Thelen, portrayed the new scholarship as ''too obscure to appreciate and too remote from everyday life.'' The profession had reached a point, he warned, ''where dazzling people with the unfamiliar and erudite was more highly prized than telling a good story or distilling wisdom.''</p>
        <p>Six years have passed, but the issues linger.  Interviewed recently at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he teaches American history, Mr. Thelen still frets about his profession's divorce from the larger world. Yet he also claims to have widened his own focus in teaching and scholarship in terms that reflect the new social history. ''It's difficult to view the nation-state as an agent of progressive change anymore,'' he says. ''I'm trying to stress the more human elements of history. The ways that individuals experience events, interpret them and then remember them are essential to understanding our national culture and beliefs.''</p>
        <p>Some historians see a clearer pattern of progress in recent years. ''Specialization is essential,'' says Linda Kerber, a history professor at the University of Iowa. ''The grand old theories we inherited were fragile and poorly researched. They didn't match up to our present standards of evidence, and we needed to be specific in order to puncture their claims. Microstudies are really the building blocks of change.''</p>
        <p>And change, Ms. Kerber believes, means a more honest, complex and inclusive vision of the past. With a solid foundation now in place, she says, historians are beginning to ask the large questions that make good synthesis inevitable. ''We're on the cusp of something extraordinary,''she says, ''an explosion of knowledge that is revolutionizing the profession.''</p>
        <p>Other historians, including Eric Foner of Columbia and David Levering Lewis of Rutgers, are less confident. Mr. Foner, whose books on race, slavery and freedom reach audiences well beyond the academic walls, is concerned by what he sees as the continued reluctance of historians to impart broad meaning in their written work.</p>
        <p>In the classroom, he notes, it's just the opposite: ''We all do synthesis there. Events don't simply happen. We provide an interpretive framework that ties the new social history to larger themes of ideology and power. We give students a clear but contested narrative that makes sense of the major features of American history while highlighting the diversity of our experience.''</p>
        <p>Above all, Mr. Foner adds, ''we stake out positions on the big issues and we defend them. When a student asks, 'Why did Andrew Jackson veto the bank bill?,' we don't stumble around and give 15 different scenarios. It seems so natural in the classroom, yet so very hard to do in print.''</p>
        <p>The failure to write boldly and clearly may help explain why commercial publishers -- not to mention the reading public -- are deserting academic history. Indeed, professional historians find themselves in an odd position today. Their subject is growing in popularity, yet their once considerable influence is on the wane. Fewer people are seeking their wisdom about the past.</p>
        <p>With some exceptions, the most widely read narratives in American history are no longer written by academic historians; and even the freshest theories connecting America's past and present are appearing in the books of ''outsiders,'' like the journalist Michael Lind's ''New American Nation,'' published in 1995, and the economist Robert Fogel's ''Fourth Great Awakening,'' released a few months ago.</p>
        <p>This wasn't always the case. Grand narratives and big theories once dominated the writing of American history. From George Bancroft and Frederick Jackson Turner in the 19th century through Charles and Mary Beard, Richard Hofstadter and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in later years, the great historians combined elegant prose and sweeping synthesis in ways that are rarely seen today.</p>
        <p>Turner wove the tale of an exceptional nation removed from the corrupting influences of Europe, a country where the frontier produced the perfect mix of abundance, individualism and equality. The Beards viewed American history in equally heroic terms, with ''the people'' battling the ''special interests'' for economic and political control.</p>
        <p>In the 1950's, an influential school of ''consensus'' history emerged. Postwar historians were haunted by memories of Nazi genocide, the threat of Soviet expansion and the spread of McCarthyism. Wary of mass movements on the left or right, they stressed the beliefs and values that united Americans rather than the crises and upheavals that divided them.</p>
        <p>Led by Hofstadter and his enormously popular books ''The American Political Tradition'' (1948) and ''The Age of Reform''(1955), the more creative consensus historians worked the neighboring fields of sociology and political science. New theories of human behavior emerged linking McCarthyism to past extremist movements and charting the assimilation of immigrant groups into the mainstream culture.</p>
        <p>There were dissenters, too. William Appleman Williams turned American exceptionalism upside down by portraying the nation as a greedy colossus searching endlessly for raw materials and foreign markets. Although some historians condemned him as a dangerous radical, there was, in fact, a large common ground. What united scholars like Turner and the Beards, Hofstadter and Williams, was their preoccupation with national history, their interest in how the United States was created, how it developed and, ultimately, how it should be judged. By focusing on large themes, they became valued participants in the public life and civic culture of their time.</p>
        <p>Of course, the field of American history up into the 1960's was a simpler, more restrictive place resembling an old boys' club, with leading scholars training their successors in elite departments reserved mostly for Protestant white men. The writing naturally reflected this insulation. There was no violence on Turner's frontier, no slaves or Indians to muddle the story. Women rarely entered these historical narratives. Racial and ethnic tensions were often minimized or ignored. The new history of recent decades exploded this complacency.</p>
        <p>So is there a way to combine the diversity and specialization of today's history with the grand narratives of the past? Can professional historians win back a broad audience?</p>
        <p>It won't be easy. Mr. Lewis, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his 1993 biography of W. E. B. Du Bois, observes that mastery of the synthetic narrative is far more difficult than it appears. At its best, he says, ''the well-told story about the national past should always be an argument, a thesis, an analysis disguised in the action and drama of its narrative.'' This is not, he declares, ''a formula to be commended to all professional historians.''</p>
        <p>Yet it seems a formula worth trying. This past year Scott Sandage, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon, taught a graduate seminar in American history. From the outset he stressed the importance of good writing, a clear thesis, solid organization, the telling of anecdotes and a smooth narrative flow. His message apparently got through. The final papers were quite readable, Mr. Sandage says. And he got an extra bonus as well. When the course ended, one of his students presented him with a plaque containing four well-chosen words: ''It's the story, stupid.''</p>
