        <p>Some of the world's finest athletes, including a healthier and humbler Michael Johnson, may have been running and leaping here tonight, but in this particular year, the only city that really matters in track and field is Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>It has been a summer of dress rehearsals in Europe, the continent that writes most of the checks and generates most of the consistent interest in the signature sport of the Olympics, and this Golden League meet did a better job than most of whetting the appetite for the real thing.</p>
        <p>For the first time since the United States Olympic trials in Sacramento, Maurice Greene, Michael Johnson and Marion Jones competed in the same place. The difference this time was that all three emerged uninjured, if not unscathed.</p>
        <p>Greene won the men's 100 meters in 9.88 seconds, which would have been the fastest legal time this year if not for the fact that the following wind was a tenth of a meter per second over the allowable limit. Johnson won the men's 400 in 44.07 seconds in his first race since he and Greene pulled up with injuries on July 23 and failed to finish the highly anticipated and hotly debated 200-meter final in Sacramento.</p>
        <p>As for Jones, she won the women's 100 in 10.83 seconds, the second-fastest time this season; it was five-hundredths of a second slower than her 10.78 in London this month.</p>
        <p>But Jones did not fare nearly so well in the long jump, her second event of the evening, finishing fifth after fouling on four of her six attempts and jumping no better than  21 feet 7 1/2 inches on her two fair efforts. Both were well short of the 22-10 effort of the winner, Tatiana Kotova, a Russian who won the first three Golden League meets this season before missing the last two because of minor injuries from an auto accident.</p>
        <p>''It seems like I can't get two events in one meet right,'' said Jones, who will try to get five events right in Sydney, where she hopes to win gold medals in all of them.</p>
        <p>In her last outing, on Aug. 11, Jones won the long jump in Zurich after struggling in the 100, getting off to a rotten start and chasing down Inger Miller to win by a hundredth of a second.</p>
        <p>''Tonight was just the opposite,'' Jones said, sounding fresh and eager after nearly two weeks at home in Raleigh, N.C., with her husband, C. J. Hunter, and her coach, Trevor Graham. ''Here I thought my 100 was very good, and I jumped so-so. But I'm very pleased with my start in the 100. That's what I was concerned about and what we corrected when I went home.''</p>
        <p>The more daunting task is drilling Jones effectively in the long jump. Though she has not lost a 100 since 1997, tonight's loss was her fourth in the long jump this season, and she is not scheduled to jump again in competition until the Olympics begin next month.</p>
        <p>Gail Devers has been much more consistent in the 100-meter hurdles and tonight she all but clinched a share of the Golden League jackpot (50 kilograms of gold) by winning in 12.53 seconds. To earn a share, athletes must win their event in five of the seven Golden League meets and then compete in the Grand Prix final in Qatar after the Olympics. Devers, undefeated in the hurdles this season, has already won five Golden League races; the last is next week in Berlin.</p>
        <p>Greene also has a chance to win the jackpot. Since returning to competition in Zurich after his hamstring injury, he has reasserted himself as the Olympic favorite in the 100.</p>
        <p>''I was really putting a lot of pressure on myself to come out there and run fast,'' Greene said. ''The wind was too much, but who cares?''</p>
        <p>Johnson, who fell to the track clutching his cramping left hamstring in the 200 meters at Sacramento, looked comfortable from the start tonight.</p>
        <p>''Everything felt very good in warm-ups and the race, and I felt I had it under control only 30 to 40 meters into the race,'' Johnson said. ''I had to recover from a lot of soreness and a lot of swelling.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>In her final 400 race before the Olympics, CATHY FREEMAN of Australia remained undefeated in the event this season winning Friday night in 49.78 seconds. . . . WILSON KIPKETER, the Kenyan-born Dane who is the world record-holder in the men's 800, was caught from behind in the final 10 meters by DJABIR SAID-GUERNI of Algeria and ANDRE BUCHER of Switzerland. Said-Guerni won in 1 minute 43.25 seconds. Kipketer, who has raced sparingly this season because of nagging injuries, was third in 1:43.35.</p>
