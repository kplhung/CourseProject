        <p>Tiger Woods has developed two habits he does not want to break: winning golf tournaments and setting records.</p>
        <p>During today's second round of the NEC Invitational, Woods added another spectacular day to his spectacular summer. He flirted with shooting a 59. He tied the Firestone Country Club course record, shooting a nine-under-par 61. And by building a seven-stroke lead, he threatened to turn another tournament into a rout.</p>
        <p>Showing no ill effects from last weekend's emotional victory at the P.G.A. Championship, Woods was 15 under par, seven strokes ahead of Phil Mickelson and eight strokes ahead of Justin Leonard in a tournament that is beginning to look like another Woods waltz.</p>
        <p>It has become obvious that Woods doesn't believe in letdowns. Instead, he never lets up. His score of 125 set a PGA Tour record for 36 holes, breaking the old mark of 126 set by six other players. Woods also tied the course record of 61 set by Jose Maria Olazabal in 1990, and it was Woods's 29th consecutive round of shooting even par or better, another tour record. Both Mark O'Meara (1993) and Craig Stadler (1997) have shot 28 consecutive rounds of even par or better, but since 1980, when the tour began keeping that statistic, nobody had shot 29 consecutive rounds without shooting over par.</p>
        <p>Nobody, that is, until today. From the first few holes, it was obvious Woods was on top of his game, which meant he would finish on top of the leader board. The big question was: How low would he go? Through his first seven holes, Woods was five under par for the day, and some people in his gallery began screaming, ''Fifty-nine! Fifty-nine!'' Only three players in tour history have shot 59 in competition -- Al Geiberger, Chip Beck and David Duval. Woods didn't get the 59. But that didn't spoil his day.</p>
        <p>How does it feel to be in the kind of zone Woods is in?</p>
        <p>''You have an idea of where you want to put the golf ball, and you're able to do it,'' said Woods, who put himself in excellent position to win this World Golf Championships event for the second consecutive year. ''The game looks easier when you do that.''</p>
        <p>It looked easier than easy for Woods. It looked almost effortless, an awesome display of power, control and putting. On the par-5, 625-yard No. 16, one of the most famous holes in golf, Woods became only the fourth player to send a ball flying over the green in two shots, joining Arnold Palmer, Raymond Floyd and John Daly.</p>
        <p>After hitting a 356-yard drive, Woods cooked a 2-iron shot that landed 6 feet past the pin and rolled into the back rough. The crowd went wild. Woods almost made eagle when he barely missed his chip shot from 20 feet, but he converted the next putt for birdie while giving another example of how his game differs from everyone else's.</p>
        <p>Woods also birdied the par-4 No. 17 to reach nine under par, meaning he needed an eagle at the par-4 No. 18 to make 59. After hitting his tee shot at No. 18 into the right rough, Woods hit his approach shot over the green, chipped to 8 feet, then made the putt for par to shoot 61.</p>
        <p>Perhaps two missed putts cost Woods a chance at 59 -- a 15-foot birdie putt at No. 13 that stopped just short of the hole, and a 4-foot putt that Woods missed at No. 14 that led to his only bogey of the day.</p>
        <p>Woods said he never seriously considered shooting 59. His main goal was to increase the one-shot lead he started the day with. From that perspective, the day was a huge success.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the competition had to feel somewhat helpless. The majors are over, Woods has won seven times this year, and this 37-player event is an excellent chance for a huge payday, with a $5 million purse, and $1 million going to the winner.</p>
        <p>But in Woods's case, the rich may get even richer. How was Mickelson supposed to feel? He shot his second consecutive 66, he started the day with a birdie and an eagle, yet Mickelson lost ground.</p>
        <p>''It's taking a lot more under par to win tournaments now,'' said Mickelson, who will be paired with Woods in Saturday's final group.</p>
        <p>Today, Woods was paired with Jim Furyk, who shot a 69, but who could not keep up.</p>
        <p>On No. 11, Furyk hit a great approach shot within 4 feet of the pin. But Woods outdid him, hitting a wedge shot from 80 yards that landed inside of Furyk's ball, 3 feet from the cup.</p>
        <p>It was that kind of day. And Woods still had the weekend to try and outdo himself.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Tiger ever enters a tournament that he doesn't think he can win,'' said Fluff Cowan, who caddies for Furyk and who used to caddie for Woods. ''Nearly flawless golf. That's how I'd describe what I saw today.''</p>
