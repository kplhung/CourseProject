        <p>An American priest who made many enemies among the powerful and corrupt in Kenya was found shot to death on Thursday on a rural roadside a few yards from his pickup truck.</p>
        <p>The Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. John Anthony Kaiser, 67, a native of Minnesota who had lived in Kenya for most of the last 36 years, died from a gun blast to his head. Near his body was a shotgun and in his shirt pocket a live round of its ammunition.</p>
        <p>But investigators said they suspect it was murder, not suicide, and the American ambassador here has urged the police to accept help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in its investigation. No spent shell was found. A local reporter who saw the body said Father Kaiser was shot from the back with such force that he was nearly decapitated.</p>
        <p>In a country with periodic -- and unsolved -- political murders, human rights groups were quick to suspect someone in government whom Father Kaiser had angered with his frequent, and public, denunciations.</p>
        <p>''Who in Kenya is desperate to kill Father Kaiser, and why now?'' asked Willy Mutunga, head of the Kenya Human Rights Commission, at a news conference of human rights groups, lawyers and women's groups today in downtown Nairobi. ''They could only be powerful people who saw him as a moral thorn in their evil flesh.''</p>
        <p>Father Kaiser most recently ran afoul of a Kenyan minister of state, Julius Ole Sunkuli, over allegations that the official had sexually violated a minor. Last year, the girl reportedly sought counsel from Father Kaiser, who advised her to speak to lawyers who later pursued a case against Mr. Sunkuli. The minister was charged with statutory rape in June and is expected to appear in court again this month. He has denied the charges.</p>
        <p>But an official close to the investigation of Father Kaiser's death said the evidence did not immediately point to any particular suspect.</p>
        <p>''Beyond the general fact that he had a number of enemies, there is no specific theory about who did this or why they did it,'' the official said. ''It could be anybody.''</p>
