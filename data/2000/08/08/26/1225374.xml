        <p>Running back Ron Dayne had been little more than a mystery through the Giants' first three exhibition games. Dayne, a first-round pick, attracted more attention by trailing most of his teammates in daily wind sprints than by carrying the ball in games.</p>
        <p>Tonight provided no conclusive evidence that Dayne is closer to dominating the National Football League as he did the college ranks at Wisconsin, but his performance showed signs of potential.</p>
        <p>Finally getting blocks from the first-team offensive line, Dayne, last year's Heisman Trophy winner, looked more capable in the Giants' backfield. He failed to post extraordinary numbers, but his 60 yards on 15 carries were an improvement over his average in the first three preseason games. Included in his performance tonight was a 5-yard touchdown run for the Giants' first score in a  24-17 loss to the Baltimore Ravens at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>Dayne recalled his fumble on his first carry against the Jets last week and said he was motivated to have a better game. ''This week, I felt confident in what I was going to do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He sounded more at ease than he was after his first three games, when he seemed defensive.</p>
        <p>''I think we're starting to see what he can do, get those tough yards,'' quarterback Kerry Collins said.</p>
        <p>In his first games, Dayne, a 5-foot-10-inch, 253-pound back, had trouble reacting quickly enough when holes emerged in the line. The first-team offense bought him more time tonight, and he capitalized, lumbering through gaps and using his size to force his way through defenses.</p>
        <p>Coach Jim Fassel had hoped to name a starting running back, presumably Dayne, before tonight's preseason finale, but he withheld an announcement. Dayne had done little to win the job, and the veteran Tiki Barber, who has started throughout the preseason, could remain the starter next Sunday in the season opener here against Arizona.</p>
        <p>After tonight's game, Fassel said he would be confident to start Dayne but held off on announcing his starter.</p>
        <p>It might not matter who starts. Fassel has shown a willingness to hand Dayne the ball throughout the preseason, and the rookie will most likely lead the Giants in carries each week.</p>
        <p>Although Barber started the game, Fassel was cautious not to overwork his top offensive players and risk injury. Barber was not on the field long; Dayne entered on the game's second play and carried for a modest 3-yard gain.</p>
        <p>On the Giants' second possession, Dayne finally gave a glimpse of his college prowess. He carried on four of the five snaps on the drive. The only play in which he was not involved was a 20-yard pass from Kerry Collins to Ike Hilliard down the right sideline.</p>
        <p>Yet Dayne's carries were the most impressive, and anticipated, plays of the drive. He rumbled through a gaping hole on the left side for 6 yards and a first down.</p>
        <p>''That's right up my alley,'' Dayne said. ''I like that when I can read the D and see what the D is doing.''</p>
        <p>After Hilliard's reception, Dayne took a pitchout right and ran unimpeded for a 5-yard touchdown. The Giants took a 7-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Dayne gained 26 yards on 7 carries with the first-team offense, which he had not played with consistently in the previous three preseason games. Trying to run behind the second-team offensive line, Dayne had carried 46 times for 151 yards.</p>
        <p>Dayne's average with the first team tonight was slightly higher, 3.7 yards. Joe Montgomery, last year's second-round pick, also saw some time at running back, but Dayne's work day was not over. With the rest of the first-team offense on the sideline, he returned in the second quarter and played the remainder of the half.</p>
        <p>''I like being in a rhythm,'' Dayne said. ''I like getting the ball like that, but sometimes you get tired.''</p>
