        <p>Charging that the Clinton administration had neglected Latin America, Gov. George W. Bush pledged today to put those countries at the center of his foreign policy agenda and outlined a way of thinking about the region that placed it on a par with American interests in Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's remarks, at Florida International University in Miami -- a site chosen by his campaign for its cultural, ethnic and immigrant links to Latin America -- were part of an indictment of the administration, which he said had pursued an aimless strategy in Latin America of ''summits without substance.''</p>

        <p>Charging that the Clinton administration had neglected Latin America, Gov. George W. Bush pledged today to put those countries at the center of his foreign policy agenda and outlined a way of thinking about the region that placed it on a par with American interests in Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's remarks, at Florida International University in Miami -- a site chosen by his campaign for its cultural, ethnic and immigrant links to Latin America -- were part of an indictment of the administration, which he said had pursued an aimless strategy in Latin America of ''summits without substance.''</p>
        <p>But the speech also dwelt in an unusually lengthy and vigorous way on Mr. Bush's sense of the importance of the region to the United States. [Excerpts, Page A9.]</p>
        <p>''Our future cannot be separated from the future of Latin America,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Should I become the president, I will look south not as an afterthought, but as a fundamental commitment.''</p>
        <p>''Those who ignore Latin America do not fully understand America itself,'' he said. ''And those who ignore our hemisphere do not fully understand American interests. This country was right to be concerned about a country like Kosovo, for example, but there are more refugees of conflict in Colombia. America is right to be concerned about Kuwait, but more of our oil comes from Venezuela. America is right to welcome trade with China, but we export nearly as much to Brazil.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also said that President Clinton had ''dropped the ball'' on trade, failing to build on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Clinton inherited from Mr.  Bush's father and pushed through Congress, with a broader free-trade zone throughout the hemisphere. And he complained that Mr. Clinton had not obtained so-called fast-track negotiating authority from Congress to conclude further trade pacts with individual countries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, proposed a few new programs to help countries in Latin America and protect the interests of the United States, but they involved relatively small amounts of money.</p>
        <p>He called for an extra $100 million a year in small-business loans to Latin American entrepreneurs, an additional $100 million a year in debt forgiveness for countries that took steps to protect tropical forests, an American Fellows program that would encourage Latin Americans to work in United States government agencies, and a counselor at each United States embassy in Latin America who would encourage charitable activities by American organizations and corporations.</p>
        <p>He also talked about helping train law enforcement officials and judges there and providing countries with more help in fighting the production and export of drugs.</p>
        <p>But he seemed most interested in simply making clear his philosophy and priorities.</p>
        <p>After the speech, Mr. Bush traveled to the Dallas suburb of Richardson for a private meeting with Vicente Fox Quesada, the president-elect of Mexico.</p>
        <p>Both the speech and the meeting with Mr. Fox allowed the Texas governor, whose lack of expertise on foreign policy has been highlighted by several verbal gaffes and challenged by Vice President Al Gore, to cast himself as a statesman engaged in the affairs of the world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and Mr. Fox followed their meeting with a news conference at which they exchanged gifts -- Mr. Fox got a Stetson-style hat that Mr. Bush called a sombrero while Mr. Bush got cowboy boots -- and Mr. Bush repeated a pledge from his speech that if he is elected president, he will arrange a summit meeting with Mr. Fox in November, before either man is inaugurated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said at the news conference that this would signal his belief that the relationship between the United States and Mexico was one ''of the most importance.''</p>
        <p>He had said earlier, in his speech, that he wanted Mexico to have as close and special a relationship with the United States as Canada and  Britain did.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's remarks and events today also carried a potential political advantage. The Republican nominee has been trying hard to woo the votes of Hispanics, and their support for him could determine whether he wins some of the states with the most electoral votes, like Florida, where Mr. Gore has recently mounted an aggressive campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush appealed directly to Cuban-Americans in Florida, where his brother Jeb is governor, with a strongly worded vow in his address, titled ''Century of the Americas,''  promising not to ease economic sanctions against Cuba unless its leader, Fidel Castro, instituted democratic reforms.</p>
        <p>''My word to you, Mr. Castro: let your people live in freedom,'' Mr. Bush said, drawing perhaps his loudest ovation.</p>
        <p>The speech and the conversation with Mr. Fox, who met the day before with Mr. Clinton and, separately, Mr. Gore, came at the end of one of the rockiest weeks in Mr. Bush's campaign since the spring primaries.</p>
        <p>And there was something undeniably unusual about the governor turning to the arena of international affairs as he sought to regain his balance.</p>
        <p>But his advisers said that the speech was scheduled weeks ago, and they noted that unlike several of his previous addresses on international affairs, this one allowed him to claim some firsthand knowledge of the subject, given that Texas and Mexico share a border. Mr. Bush, for example, had met Mr. Fox at least two times before today.</p>
        <p>But Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said Mr. Bush was clearly not prepared to represent the United States to the world.</p>
        <p>''Just this week,'' Mr. Hattaway said, ''he criticized our own military readiness, and his record as governor consists mostly of ribbon cuttings for new bridges to Mexico.''</p>
        <p>Other aides to Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush's remarks ignored many of the administration's successful efforts in Latin America. They noted that Nafta, which opened trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada, was signed into law by President Clinton in 1993.</p>
        <p>They also drew attention to the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which promoted trade among those islands, and what they described as successful efforts to curb or end violence in Ecuador, Peru and Guatemala and to provide financial aid to Mexico and Brazil at crucial times.</p>
        <p>Moreover, they said, Mr. Clinton's inability to gain fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements without amendments by federal legislators was the result of a Republican-controlled Congress that would not give it to him. At the time, in addition to Republican opposition, some Congressional Democrats also opposed the legislation for fear of alienating labor constituencies.</p>
        <p>But Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, said Mr. Clinton nonetheless warranted blame, because it was his responsibility ''to state an agenda and persuade and cajole people to follow it.''</p>
        <p>''You can't seem halfhearted about it,'' Ms. Rice added, implying that Mr. Clinton had.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rice said Mr. Bush's comparison of Kosovo and Colombia was not an argument against military intervention in the former place or for such intervention in the latter.</p>
        <p>Rather, she said, it was an expression of Mr. Bush's philosophy that ''you start with strong neighbors and reach out from there.''</p>
        <p>She and Mr. Bush both said that the Clinton administration's recent approval of extra aid to Colombia for a fight against drugs and corruption was the right course of action.</p>
        <p>In previous foreign-policy speeches and remarks on the campaign trail, Mr. Bush has identified many areas of the world as especially important to the United States, including the Far East, the Middle East and Russia.</p>
        <p>And nothing in his remarks today suggested he was lifting Latin America high above those.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has not yet made a priority of Africa, which has been discussed more extensively by his rival, Mr. Gore. Like Mr. Clinton, however, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Gore has suggested that they would change the American position that there is no strategic interest in Africa that would warrant either military intervention or major economic aid.</p>
        <p>Both Ms. Rice, in interviews with reporters, and Mr. Bush, in the address itself, said that what the Clinton administration -- Mr. Bush called it the Clinton-Gore administration -- had essentially failed to do was perpetuate and extend the strides in peace, democracy and trade that were well under way in 1992.</p>
        <p>That was when Mr. Bush's father, in the last full year of his presidency, lost his re-election bid to Bill Clinton. Ms. Rice worked as a Russia expert on the National Security Council under President George Bush.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rice said that while Mr. Clinton signed Nafta, ''I think the Bush administration laid the groundwork.''</p>
        <p>Reflecting on the situation when his father, whom he did not actually name, left office, Mr. Bush said, ''The promise of that moment has been squandered.''</p>
        <p>As a result, he said, the drug traffic in Latin America was too heavy, the disparities in wealth were too severe and there were too many ''vast, urban slums where children scramble for survival.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said both in his speech and at the news conference with Mr. Fox that he believed the border between the United States and Mexico needed to be vigorously enforced, but that it must be done ''in humane ways.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox has called for a more open border, and Mr. Bush said the men had discussed that issue, but the Texas governor dwelled on their common belief that Mexico was a country and economy on the rise.</p>
        <p>''His victory sends a strong signal of reform and modernization in Mexico,'' Mr. Bush said of Mr. Fox's election.</p>
