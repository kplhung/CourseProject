        <p>Three American evangelists who were detained in central China on Wednesday along with a large group of Chinese Christians were released on Friday, their pastor in California said, and today they were flying to Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Officials in Henan Province, where the arrests occurred, told an American diplomat that the three American citizens had been detained for ''activities incompatible with the tourist status under which they entered China.''</p>
        <p>All three were Taiwan-born members of a Protestant church in California that sends members on brief missions into China to lend moral and financial support to the so-called house churches. These are fervent Christian groups that reject the leadership of the government-sponsored church, and often suffer police harassment and imprisonment.</p>
        <p>The three were detained along with Chinese followers of the China Fangcheng Church, a large Protestant group whose top leaders were sent to labor camps last year.</p>
        <p>The pastor in California, who has spoken by telephone to his Chinese colleagues, said about 100 of the detained Chinese were still being held at a police station or local prison, but did not know if any would face criminal charges.  One woman was beaten by police, the pastor said, while another, who was pregnant, was freed. Several of the worshipers from the original group of 130 managed to escape.</p>
