        <p>New York State's education commissioner, Richard Mills, and New York City's schools chancellor, Harold Levy, have reached a compromise on a lawsuit by the state aimed at barring the city from placing uncertified teachers in low-performing schools as of next month. The accord gives the city breathing room but requires it to reach full compliance by 2001. This will not be easy, given a nationwide teacher shortage that could stagger schools statewide unless Gov. George Pataki and the Legislature develop a strategy to produce and recruit high-quality teachers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills brought the lawsuit to enforce a new state regulation requiring the city to hire only certified teachers in low-performing schools beginning this fall. The compromise allows the city to delay its compliance in high-shortage fields like math and science, in recognition that filling these positions will be difficult. But the same regulation that resulted in this suit will soon require that every newly hired teacher in the state be certified. This will be problematic. There is a national bidding war for teacher talent, and about half the state's teacher corps could actually retire over the next decade. For starters, New York needs to pass a law allowing seasoned teachers who have reached age 55 to pay their pensions into an annuity and continue teaching without an earnings limitation.</p>

        <p>New York State's education commissioner, Richard Mills, and New York City's schools chancellor, Harold Levy, have reached a compromise on a lawsuit by the state aimed at barring the city from placing uncertified teachers in low-performing schools as of next month.

George Pataki and the Legislature develop a strategy to produce and recruit high-quality teachers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills brought the lawsuit to enforce a new state regulation requiring the city to hire only certified teachers in low-performing schools beginning this fall. The compromise allows the city to delay its compliance in high-shortage fields like math and science, in recognition that filling these positions will be difficult. But the same regulation that resulted in this suit will soon require that every newly hired teacher in the state be certified. This will be problematic. There is a national bidding war for teacher talent, and about half the state's teacher corps could actually retire over the next decade. For starters, New York needs to pass a law allowing seasoned teachers who have reached age 55 to pay their pensions into an annuity and continue teaching without an earnings limitation.</p>
        <p>The State Legislature has begun to focus on the problem but has fallen short of the inventiveness that is on display in Massachusetts, California, New Jersey and North Carolina. In the 1990's, Gov. James Hunt led North Carolina to greater gains on national reading tests than in any other state. North Carolina raised statewide teacher salaries, supplied novice teachers with paid mentors as well as other supports, and gives financial rewards for teachers who achieve national certification. Albany will need to devise similar measures to get New York through its teacher shortage.</p>
