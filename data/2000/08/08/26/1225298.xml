        <p>Responding to a proliferation of Internet-based businesses selling cars, the Ford Motor Company and a council of its 4,200 Ford-brand dealers announced today that they would set up their own online retailer, FordDirect.com, to help customers find Ford vehicles at fixed prices at dealerships nationwide.</p>
        <p>The enterprise will start doing business next month in California, where customers have shown the greatest interest in online shopping, and then gradually expand to cover the entire country by sometime next year, Ford said. Dealers selling other Ford brands -- Lincoln, Mercury, Volvo, Mazda, Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin -- will be invited to join the business, but Ford-brand dealers will have 80 percent voting control of the company.</p>

        <p>Responding to a proliferation of Internet-based businesses selling cars, the Ford Motor Company and a council of its 4,200 Ford-brand dealers announced today that they would set up their own online retailer, FordDirect.com, to help customers find Ford vehicles at fixed prices at dealerships nationwide.</p>
        <p>The enterprise will start doing business next month in California, where customers have shown the greatest interest in online shopping, and then gradually expand to cover the entire country by sometime next year, Ford said. Dealers selling other Ford brands -- Lincoln, Mercury, Volvo, Mazda, Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin -- will be invited to join the business, but Ford-brand dealers will have 80 percent voting control of the company.</p>
        <p>By including every Ford dealer in the country, the new enterprise will increase the pressure on dealers to adopt fixed prices or a narrow band of prices for all of their sales, instead of subjecting customers to hours of negotiation. The prices posted on FordDirect.com will be set by region, based on demand, instead of being the manufacturer's suggested retail price. The site will also give dealers' invoice prices, but not to customers with ZIP codes indicating they live in those states that have banned the distribution of invoice information.</p>
        <p>Ford dealers will be authorized to offer less than the fixed price posted on FordDirect.com to buyers who contact them through the service, so customers will still have an incentive to do some bargaining.</p>
        <p>FordDirect.com is a less ambitious business model than that of some businesses not affiliated with automakers, like the car-buying site installed at the top of Amazon.com's home page on Thursday by Amazon and by Greenlight.com, a privately held company partly owned by several car dealership chains. Unlike Amazon.com, for example, the Ford site will not provide online appraisals of automobiles that customers want to trade in.</p>
        <p>General Motors proposed last week to its dealers the creation of an online retailing site that would allow buyers to compare the specifications of G.M. cars to models from other manufacturers, and even put buyers in touch with dealerships selling non-G.M. brands. But FordDirect will do neither.</p>
        <p>Ford criticized Amazon and Greenlight on Wednesday, suggesting that they were essentially operating as brokers and might violate laws in some states that bar anyone except dealers from selling cars. But FordDirect, like the Amazon and Greenlight venture, will allow customers to choose options, receive a price quote and arrange financing for a specific vehicle, while requiring customers to complete the transaction either at a dealership or with dealership employees who would bring the vehicle to their home. Like Amazon and Greenlight, FordDirect will also allow customers to put down a deposit on a vehicle, using their credit cards.</p>
        <p>Jim O'Connor, Ford's vice president for the Ford-brand division, said that FordDirect.com was not involved in brokering cars because it was an extension of the existing franchise relationship between the automaker and its dealers. A broker is an intermediary between a dealer and the final user of the vehicle.</p>
        <p>Randy Ortiz, Ford's executive director of consumer e-business, said the company and its dealers had studied regulations in every state. FordDirect should meet every state's laws, he said, but he acknowledged that a few state regulators might not agree.</p>
        <p>FordDirect will charge dealers a fee of $200 for each completed sale, making it a direct competitor to companies like Amazon.com, Greenlight.com and Autobytel.com, which also rely on payments from dealers.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler has a less elaborate site intended to steer customers to the Web sites of dealers with good records for customer service.</p>
        <p>FordDirect will be unusual among online auto retailing sites in that it will set prices regionally, rather than nationally. Ford and its dealers will use daily computer data on all sales nationwide, a resource not available to companies outside the auto industry, to calculate the regional prices.</p>
        <p>Customers in Texas are not as willing as customers in snowy Detroit to pay for four-wheel drive, for example, and the regional pricing model will reflect this with lower prices for four-wheel drive in places like Texas, said Jerry Reynolds, a Ford dealer in Garland, Tex.</p>
