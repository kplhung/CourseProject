        <p>Perhaps no intersection in the city is as chaotic as Herald Square, where the traffic of 34th Street, Broadway and Avenue of the Americas intersects with tens of thousands of shoppers, tourists and Midtown workers in a compressed patch of streets that defy the rules of sound urban planning.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to restore some order to the area, the city's Department of Transportation has embarked on the final stage of a reconfiguration that would eliminate a lane of traffic on Broadway, reverse the flow of cars on 33rd Street, and create pedestrian plazas below 34th Street.</p>

        <p>Perhaps no intersection in the city is as chaotic as Herald Square, where the traffic of 34th Street, Broadway and Avenue of the Americas intersects with tens of thousands of shoppers, tourists and Midtown workers in a compressed patch of streets that defy the rules of sound urban planning.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to restore some order to the area, the city's Department of Transportation has embarked on the final stage of a reconfiguration that would eliminate a lane of traffic on Broadway, reverse the flow of cars on 33rd Street, and create pedestrian plazas below 34th Street.</p>
        <p>The changes seek to make things easier for the roughly 20,000 people who travel through the area during a typical peak hour, competing with thousands of vehicles moving through Midtown.</p>
        <p>''It would rank among the most congested areas of the city,'' Joseph G. Albano, the Manhattan borough commissioner for the department, said in an interview yesterday. And unlike similarly congested Times Square, the Herald Square area and its traffic patterns are particularly problematic, with southbound Broadway running into the northbound Avenue of the Americas.</p>
        <p>In addition to the traffic changes, the plan adds more pedestrian islands for those who want to walk through the intersection. The plan was designed by Transportation Department engineers who had been monitoring the area for about three years. Herald Square is either home to or near several subway lines, a PATH train station, an entrance to Pennsylvania Station and several department stores, including Macy's.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Department and the 34th Street Partnership, the local Business Improvement District, finished placing barriers on Broadway and Avenue of the Americas between 34th and 33rd Streets and in certain lanes yesterday. City officials said they had also installed video cameras throughout the area to monitor the flow of traffic, and they will review the tapes each month to judge the impact of the changes.</p>
        <p>The problems with Herald Square have long been a concern not only for local businesses, but also for city officials worried about the dangers the intersections posed to pedestrians. But solutions have been elusive, as few plans found the support of the many different groups that use the area.</p>
        <p>''Our No. 1 priority is safety,'' Mr. Albano said. ''We are concerned with it, but we are also looking for a way to balance the needs of both the vehicular and pedestrian traffic.''</p>
        <p>According to 1997 state transportation data, 315 people were treated at hospitals for injuries in accidents around Herald Square. The intersection of West 34th Street, Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas ranked as the third most dangerous in Manhattan and seventh most dangerous in New York City, officials said. From 1994 through 1997, 25 people were killed in crashes in Herald Square, according to Transportation Alternatives, a local advocacy group that promotes travel without cars.</p>
        <p>John Kaehny, the group's executive director, said the changes to Herald Square ''mark a huge improvement and step away from this administration's car-first policy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaehny has advocated similar changes for years, particularly those that provide pedestrians more walking space. He said he envisioned this as a beginning step in ''Broadway eventually being choked out of existence,'' closed to cars. The city's plan, he said, ''would make traffic move more smoothly because it would restore the grid and it would create a lot of precious pedestrian spaces.''</p>
        <p>He added that ''the timing of the lights needs to be tweaked,'' but said  that the city should spend money to make the changes permanent.</p>
        <p>Dan Pisark, the vice president for retail services at the 34th Street Partnership, said: ''This experiment really favors pedestrians'' and ''seems to work. Buses were getting through, people were making it through.''</p>
        <p>The plan creates wide fenced-in areas on the west side of Broadway and the east side of the Avenue of Americas for pedestrians to walk through. It also eliminates one lane of southbound traffic on Broadway and turns part of it into a lane that would allow drivers to drop off passengers without slowing traffic, officials said.</p>
        <p>The changes come only a year after a $2.25 million restoration and renovation to Herald Square and Greeley Square. Those improvements have brought more people into the area, city officials said. The changes will be made permanent if city engineers determine that the current experiment has been a success, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pisark said he saw something a bit unusual yesterday: an ambulance swiftly made its way south on Broadway through Herald Square in rush-hour traffic. ''My hat's off to the Department of Transportation,'' he said. ''That's quite a feat.''</p>
