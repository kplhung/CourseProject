        <p>As an artist, Dar Williams has a little stumble, like the misstep the star in a college play makes before giving the performance of her life. She's a resolutely good girl, but not a perfect one. The catch in her voice and the edge of doubt in her exuberant songs change her fans' feelings for her from admiration to besottedness.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams made a lot of self-deprecating jokes on Tuesday evening at the Bottom Line during the first of three shows celebrating the release of her fourth album, ''The Green World'' (Razor and Tie). The joking was intended partly to hide the nerves that came from having friends in the audience, including members of the Berrigan family, whom she honored in ''I Had No Right,'' a new song celebrating their history of direct-action politics.</p>

        <p>As an artist, Dar Williams has a little stumble, like the misstep the star in a college play makes before giving the performance of her life. She's a resolutely good girl, but not a perfect one. The catch in her voice and the edge of doubt in her exuberant songs change her fans' feelings for her from admiration to besottedness.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams made a lot of self-deprecating jokes on Tuesday evening at the Bottom Line during the first of three shows celebrating the release of her fourth album, ''The Green World'' (Razor and Tie). The joking was intended partly to hide the nerves that came from having friends in the audience, including members of the Berrigan family, whom she honored in ''I Had No Right,'' a new song celebrating their history of direct-action politics.</p>
        <p>The rambling discourses, like such topical songs, showed Ms. Wililiams's folkie stripes; in this most literary of genres, singer-songwriters never seem able to offer their lyrics without footnotes. Her chat, luckily, flowed like another part of her songs, which affectingly balance banter and confession.</p>
        <p>It would be easy for Ms. Williams to let the poetic cliches she gravitates toward ease her into epiphanies. Insecurity, the cosmic rather than the personal kind, saves her from that. The new song ''It Happens Every Day,'' for example, skipped along from images of children playing to coeds underlining copies of Nabokov novels in a coffee house to Ms. Williams herself seeing love in the faces of passers-by.</p>
        <p>It all seemed very endearing, almost too much so, until the last line. ''And every day will happen without you,'' she sang, seasoning her affirmations with a bitter dash of loneliness, or, in the spiritual sense, egolessness.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams's musical style complements this healthy uncertainty. Although she offered her share of gracefully rendered ballads, more often she led her four-piece band into driving folk-rockers, sometimes reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen's sprightlier songs. As she upped the tempo with her acoustic guitar strumming, the catch in her voice held the songs back slightly, so they retained their air of striving and discovery.</p>
        <p>The mood Ms. Wiliams captured might have once been called collegiate, and she definitely attracts a fan base of young women bent on self-realization. Songs like ''When I Was a Boy,'' about the freedom of childlike gender confusion, and the self-explanatory ''I Won't Be Your Yoko Ono'' offered these fans clever windows into feminist thinking.</p>
        <p>But good timing is gaining the 33-year-old Ms. Williams a larger audience. As she has matured, dissecting an early midlife crisis and spiritual quest on ''The Green World,'' popular culture is showing more interest in the emotional dilemmas of less-than-rooted adult women. Ms. Williams could easily provide the soundtrack for television hits like ''Ally McBeal'' and ''Sex in the City.'' Her music could even challenge the male creators of those shows to see a woman's questions as more than an occasion for a laugh.</p>
