        <p>New York City's schools chancellor, Harold Levy, seems to have learned a great deal from the summer of 1999, when his predecessor, Rudy Crew, was rushed by City Hall into requiring students who failed year-end promotion examinations in math and reading to attend summer school. That first session was chaotic and poorly managed. But this year saw dramatic improvements in transportation, staffing, record-keeping and especially attendance, which was substantially better but still lower than it should be. Attendance is unlikely to improve until the state education code is rewritten to make summer school mandatory for students who fail during the regular school year.</p>
        <p>State education law still treats summer school as optional -- even though summer school was expanded last year as part of an aggressive new policy that ended ''social promotion'' for children in grades three through eight, who had historically been sent on to the next level even if they failed to show the necessary academic progress. The task of getting these students up to par was complicated last summer by staff and supply shortages, as well as by haphazard record-keeping that made it difficult to determine which students were coming to class. A better system put in place in the spring  seems to have remedied this problem. In addition, a vigorous recruiting effort staved off a teacher shortage, allowing the system to attract even more summer school teachers than it needed.</p>

        <p>State education law still treats summer school as optional -- even though summer school was expanded last year as part of an aggressive new policy that ended ''social promotion'' for children in grades three through eight, who had historically been sent on to the next level even if they failed to show the necessary academic progress. The task of getting these students up to par was complicated last summer by staff and supply shortages, as well as by haphazard record-keeping that made it difficult to determine which students were coming to class. A better system put in place in the spring  seems to have remedied this problem. In addition, a vigorous recruiting effort staved off a teacher shortage, allowing the system to attract even more summer school teachers than it needed.</p>
        <p>This summer the Board of Education introduced more rigorous reading and math tests that are based on the new standards recently established by the State Board of Regents. The new tests preclude exact comparisons with last summer's performance, but this year's results are nonetheless encouraging. More than 40 percent of students who failed year-end promotion tests in reading during the regular year performed well enough on the summer school test to be promoted on the basis of the test result alone. The success rate was slightly lower on the new math test. When both class work and test performance were considered, 63 percent of the summer school students were recommended for promotion.</p>
        <p>In all, 62,000 students had been told to either attend summer school or be left back. Of these, 88 percent actually completed the summer session, up from 64 percent last year. Only about 1,400 of those ordered to attend failed to show up at all, but an additional 6,000 children started summer school and were then withdrawn by their parents, in clear defiance of the board's new social promotion policy. The no-shows and dropouts will be automatically held back -- intensifying crowding in the lower grades, where the system is desperately seeking to reduce class size. The most effective way to cut down on truancy -- and get poorly prepared students into the classroom where they belong -- is to make the summer session mandatory.</p>
