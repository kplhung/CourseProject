        <p>David Brody letter comments on Aug 21 article on Verizon's agreeing to let its unions organize wireless employees by means of card checks</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Verizon has agreed to card checks as evidence that its wireless employees want union representation (front page, Aug. 21). No one seems to be wondering why it is the company's decision to make. After all, labor law says if workers want a union, they are entitled to have one.</p>
        <p>Card checks were once prescribed by the National Labor Relations Board as a reasonable way of measuring employee sentiment. The mandatory election is one in an ingenious array of modifications that have transformed a law intended to shield the rights of workers from coercion into one whose effect is to hold those rights hostage to the employer's consent.</p>

        <p>The talk has been about the impact of the unionization deal on Verizon's competitiveness and shareholder value. What we really should be talking about is our corrupted labor law.  DAVID BRODY  Kensington, Calif., Aug. 21, 2000</p>
