        <p>The legal predicament surrounding Rashard Casey has dominated discussion about Sunday's Kickoff Classic between Penn State and Southern California at Giants Stadium. An accusation of assault, now being investigated by prosecutors, is the reason the Nittany Lions refused to make Casey, their starting quarterback, available today when both teams gathered for news conferences at the Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he needs this,'' Penn State Coach Joe Paterno told reporters. ''You couldn't resist asking him some questions.''</p>
        <p>But another quarterback in the game is also dealing with personal travail, and his story may prove to be a more enduring tale. He is the Trojans' Carson Palmer, whose sophomore season ended in 1999 with a broken collarbone in the third game.</p>
        <p>A drop-back passer who admires the Dallas Cowboys star Troy Aikman and plays a little like him, Palmer is thought to be a better professional prospect than Casey. While Casey has been known to flee the backfield quickly and did not earn first-string status until his fifth season, Palmer started as a freshman and is projected as the pocket-protected nucleus of Coach Paul Hackett's attack for three more years. (Because of a medical waiver, Palmer is still a sophomore.)</p>
        <p>At today's U.S.C. news conference, Palmer avoided discussing allegations that Casey and a friend beat an off-duty police officer in May in Hoboken, N.J., during an early-morning fight outside a bar. But Palmer did compare and contrast their playing styles, and he spoke with admiration of his counterpart.</p>
        <p>''In college football,'' Palmer said, ''it helps a lot if you can run, because college teams don't really do a very good job of stopping quarterbacks who get outside the pocket and make big plays.</p>
        <p>''From a fan's perspective, I think it would be more fun to watch a guy like Rashard play.''</p>
        <p>Paterno said Casey would be more patient now before taking flight. Palmer and U.S.C. understand the reasoning, because Palmer got in trouble last fall by running with the ball. Near the end of the first half against Oregon, Palmer took on a big Duck and came out second best. With Palmer out for the season, U.S.C. lost six of its next seven games and finished at 6-6. Hackett said his quarterback has become more enlightened.</p>
        <p>''As you develop as a quarterback, your judgment improves,'' Hackett said. ''When you are young and just getting started, you feel like you can leap over tall buildings. There are times and moments to take chances.''</p>
        <p>And there are also times to step out of bounds or slide to a stop to avoid the full impact of a tackler, Hackett said. This could allow Palmer to rise from the turf to do what he does best.</p>
        <p>''Carson is a driver with the ball; he throws in between the seams and the creases because of his great strength,'' Hackett said. ''He came to U.S.C. with the idea he would play in as many high-profile games as humanly possible.''</p>
        <p>Sunday's game ''is Carson Palmer's kind of game,'' Hackett said.</p>
        <p>The coach added, ''It's the reason that he plays football.''</p>
        <p>Palmer certainly looks the part. At 6 feet 5 inches and 220 pounds, he is clean-cut, lanky and fair-haired. In conversation, he projects an air of self-confidence that stops short of cockiness.</p>
        <p>Discussing film study to prepare for defenses, Palmer said, ''Hopefully, there's one cornerback or safety we can pick on.''</p>
        <p>Referring to his injury and idleness last autumn, Palmer said he was buoyed by his family, his girlfriend and his religious faith. ''I'm hurt for a reason,'' he said. ''It's going to work out in the end.''</p>
        <p>He wanted to play football when he was small, but his parents refused, in part for financial reasons. When his father brought home a helmet and pads before Palmer entered fourth grade, ''I just went nuts'' with happiness, he said.</p>
        <p>His mother had a different reaction. ''It made my mom mad,'' Palmer said. ''She freaks out about me getting hurt.'' He broke the same collarbone in high school, along with a foot.</p>
        <p>Comparing his Pacific-10 school to Big Ten schools like Penn State, Palmer said games rarely sell out on the West Coast because there is more for the fans to do. He said it is the same for the players.</p>
        <p>''Football is the only thing going on,'' he said of Big Ten schools. ''That's not what I wanted. I like to be able to go to the beach.''</p>
