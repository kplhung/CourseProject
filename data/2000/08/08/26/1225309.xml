        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>LIKE MINDS  Vice President Al Gore has found a soul mate, at least in his views of how government should work. He is Vicente Fox Quesada, the president-elect of Mexico, who is so simpatico with Mr. Gore that he ordered up a Spanish translation of a Gore report on reinventing government. Mr. Gore wrote the 150-page report, titled ''From Red Tape to Results,'' in 1994. The next year, Mr. Fox made it required reading for his staff. The gist of it is that government should be run more like a business, with attention to customer service and performance agreements.</p>

        <p>Mr. Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive, distilled the report's message on his business cards. They read, in Spanish, ''To create a good government that is competitive, transparent, honest, participatory and pro-active, one that works better, costs less and benefits society.''</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>A POSTCONVENTION HIGH  For all the soporific effect this year's party conventions had on some viewers, it seems they left good feelings in many an American heart. A poll by the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University found that opinions of the presidential campaign became much more positive this month. Of about 1,000 adults surveyed after the conventions, 50 percent said they were encouraged by recent campaign events, while only 25 percent said they were discouraged. And 61 percent said they thought the campaign's tone had recently been positive, while only 17 percent said it had been negative. All good news for Shorenstein researchers, whose concern about political apathy and alienation led them to call themselves the Vanishing Voter Project.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>WISHFUL IN WISCONSIN  The leading Republican candidate for the United States Senate in Wisconsin, John Gillespie, has challenged his opponent, Senator Herb Kohl, to a campaign spending cap of $4 million, or about $1 per voter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gillespie, a political novice, wants to ''get a handle on outrageous campaign spending,'' said his campaign manager, Bruce Pfaff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gillespie has two challengers in the Republican primary on Sept. 12, but he is considered the likely nominee. Mr. Kohl, the multimillionaire philanthropist, is unlikely to agree to the cap, said Joanne Anton, his campaign manager. She said that Mr. Kohl, who is seeking his third term, will spend less than the $6.8 million he spent in 1994 and will spend the least amount possible to run an effective campaign.</p>
