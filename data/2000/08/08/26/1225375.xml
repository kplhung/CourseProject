        <p>RUSSIA: TRANQUILIZER REPORTS DENIED  The mother of a sailor who died on the submarine Kursk angrily denied that officials had tranquilized her to halt her denunciation of a Kremlin official at a stormy meeting on the disaster. Videotape showed that Nadya Tylik collapsed in mid-tirade after being injected during a confrontation with Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov. But Ms. Tylik said her husband had asked a doctor for the injection because he feared the confrontation would worsen a heart ailment. Contrary suggestions in the Western press, she said, were ''lots of lies.''</p>

        <p>TURKEY: 7 ACCUSED IN BOMBING PLAN  Seven people suspected of belonging to a guerrilla group were arrested and accused of planning a bomb attack on the Incirlik air base in Turkey, from which American and British planes carry out patrols over the no-flight zones in Iraq. No details of the plot or the arrests were announced. The police also said a member of the group, the Revolutionary Peoples' Liberation Army-Front, was arrested in Istanbul in possession of explosives, hand grenades and a gun.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: JOINING INTERNATIONAL COURT  The government said it would publish legislation enabling Britain to join an international criminal court that would try suspects on charges of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. So far 15 countries have passed such laws; 60 must do so before the court can come into existence. The United States opposes the court, saying it would make American soldiers vulnerable to politically motivated prosecutions abroad.</p>

        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: MILOSEVIC WIFE IS CANDIDATE  Mirjana Markovic, the influential wife of President Slobodan Milosevic, will run for election in the Sept. 24 voting for the federal Parliament. Ms. Markovic, leader of the neo-Communist Yugoslav Left Party, heads a list of candidates from Pozarevac, the couple's hometown in central Serbia. The English-language newsletter VIP said it was the first time Ms. Markovic had run for Parliament since her husband rose to power in the late 1980's.</p>

        <p>CANADA: PREMIER DERIDES POLLS  Prime Minister Jean Chretien, in power since 1993, has dismissed polling trends that show his Liberal Party slumping and the opposition Canadian Alliance rising. ''We will win the next election because we have a huge majority over everybody else,'' he said. Mr. Chretien, who has vowed to seek a third term in elections that are to be held by next June, told reporters he was not bothered by an Angus Reid poll that showed Liberal support falling to 43 percent of respondents and Alliance support rising to 25 percent.</p>

        <p>PERU, JORDAN: ARMS RUNNING DENIED  Jordan angrily denied accusations by President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru that top Jordanian commanders were involved in the trafficking of thousands of Russian assault rifles through Peru to Colombian guerrillas. Foreign Minister Abdelelah al-Jatib said Jordan and Peru were involved in legal arms sales, and that corrupt Peruvian officials ''are not capable of controlling the activities of traffickers in their own country.''</p>

        <p>PAKISTAN: DEMOCRACY PLEA  Commonwealth Secretary General Don McKinnon arrived in Islamabad to urge the military rulers to make an ''early return'' to democracy. ''This is the beginning of a series of high-level discussions which hopefully will result in democratic elections as soon as possible,'' he said. The Supreme Court validated last year's military takeover and gave Gen. Pervez Musharraf until Oct. 12, 2002, to hold a general election.</p>

        <p>IRAQ: REPORT OF MISSILE FACTORY  Germany's intelligence agency says it has detected a factory 25 miles southwest of Baghdad where Iraq is making missiles able to carry conventional, chemical or biological weapons. ''There is a real danger that sooner or later Germany will be within the range of these weapons,'' the agency was quoted as saying in the daily Bild.</p>

        <p>SOMALIA: PRESIDENT CHOSEN  The fledgling Parliament, meeting in Arta, Djibouti, elected Abdiqassim Salad Hassan as president, Somalia's first since it collapsed into anarchy nine years ago. Mr. Abdiqassim Salad, 58, was deputy prime minister in the government of Muhammad Siad Barre, who was ousted in 1991. He will pick a cabinet and return to Somalia, where warlords have warned they will not allow the government.</p>

        <p>LETTER TO QADDAFI RELEASED  Secretary General Kofi Annan, intending to squash reports that there had been a secret deal with Libya to limit the scope of the trial of two Libyans accused in the Lockerbie airliner bombing, released a letter he wrote to Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya last year. The letter and an annex assured Colonel Qaddafi that the trial would not be used to undermine his regime, but made clear that normal prosecutorial procedures would be followed.</p>
