        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report that although the recent trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam was four years in negotiation, labor conditions that ''have been an issue'' because of Vietnam's reputation for sweatshop factories were not addressed (news article, Aug. 22).</p>
        <p>This is just the latest example of this administration's failure to defend the interests of American manufacturers and their workers. And it is the workers who bear the burden, since the inevitable outcome of deals like this is that manufacturers wind up moving their factories to countries like Vietnam.</p>

        <p>There is nothing wrong about giving aid to foreign countries. But it is important to assess which American constituency is asked to pay the price -- all Americans, through their taxes, or just American workers, through their jobs.</p>
