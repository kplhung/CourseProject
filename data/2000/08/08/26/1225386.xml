        <p>For Thomas Engvist of Sweden, it could be coming together at the right time. Engvist, who took the title in Cincinnati earlier this month and then reached the quarterfinals in Indianapolis, defeated Fabrice Santoro in straight sets Friday in Commack, N.Y. The victory propelled him into the Hamlet Cup semifinals and signaled his readiness for next week's United States Open.</p>
        <p>''Everyone has different ways of preparing for the big ones,'' said Engvist, who is seeded seventh for the Open. ''For myself, I like to play a lot of matches. When I do that, I play better. I'm confident, I'm winning matches . . . this has been the best I've been preparing ever.''</p>

        <p>For Thomas Engvist of Sweden, it could be coming together at the right time. Engvist, who took the title in Cincinnati earlier this month and then reached the quarterfinals in Indianapolis, defeated Fabrice Santoro in straight sets Friday in Commack, N.Y. The victory propelled him into the Hamlet Cup semifinals and signaled his readiness for next week's United States Open.</p>
        <p>''Everyone has different ways of preparing for the big ones,'' said Engvist, who is seeded seventh for the Open. ''For myself, I like to play a lot of matches. When I do that, I play better. I'm confident, I'm winning matches . . . this has been the best I've been preparing ever.''</p>
        <p>Serving 11 aces and refusing to be goaded by Santoro's frustrating array of drop shots, slices and dinks, Engvist rallied from 0-4 in the first set to post a 7-6 (4), 6-4 victory. Saturday, the third-seeded Enqvist will face Arnaud Clement of France, who defeated Michael Chang, 6-3, 6-2, in the day's final match.</p>
        <p>In Friday's other semifinal, top-seeded Magnus Norman, the Swede who is the defending champion, will play 11th-seeded Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands. Krajicek was waved into the semifinals on a walkover when Carlos Moya withdrew Friday morning with an injury to his right big toe.</p>
        <p>Moya, who defeated Jan-Michael Gambill by 3-6, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (5), apparently injured his toe during the match, which began Thursday evening but lasted past midnight. His status for the United States Open is uncertain, although Moya insisted he would play.</p>
