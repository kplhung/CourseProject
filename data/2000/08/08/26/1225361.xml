        <p>Two days after canceling one advertisement that attacked Vice President Al Gore on his trustworthiness, the Republicans today released another that sharply criticizes Mr. Gore's plan for a prescription drug benefit for older Americans.

        <p>The Republican National Committee is spending $7 million to broadcast the 30-second advertisement in nine states beginning Monday. The sum is a huge one this early, and it underscores how urgently the Republicans believe they need to counter Mr. Gore's surge in the polls.</p>

        <p>Two days after canceling one advertisement that attacked Vice President Al Gore on his trustworthiness, the Republicans today released another that sharply criticizes Mr. Gore's plan for a prescription drug benefit for older Americans. It is the first attack commercial of the postconvention campaign.</p>
        <p>The Republican National Committee is spending $7 million to broadcast the 30-second advertisement in nine states beginning Monday. The sum is a huge one this early, and it underscores how urgently the Republicans believe they need to counter Mr. Gore's surge in the polls.</p>
        <p>Even as the party prepares to run the commercial, the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, is distancing itself from it by buying its own commercial on the subject but without the comparison to Mr. Gore's plan or the suggestion that Mr. Gore's plan is bad for older Americans.</p>
        <p>The party commercial says in part: ''And Al Gore? Gore opposed bipartisan reform. He's pushing a big-government plan that lets Washington bureaucrats interfere with what your doctors prescribe. The Gore Prescription Plan: Bureaucrats decide. The Bush Prescription Plan: Seniors choose.''</p>
        <p>While the narrator says that Mr. Gore opposed reform, the commercial shows Mr. Gore speaking in the White House briefing room, gesturing defensively. The implication is that the the vice president is explaining his opposition to the Bipartisan Medicare Commission, but the image is strikingly similar to that of his news conference two years ago when he said seven times that there was ''no controlling legal authority'' over whether he raised money from the White House.</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said that the commercial was misleading because Mr. Bush had not offered a specific prescription drug plan.</p>
        <p>''Zip, zero, nada, nothing,'' Mr. Lehane said, adding that the commercial seemed to be a defensive move.</p>
        <p>Republican strategists acknowledged that Mr. Gore had gained ground with his constant discussion of prescription drugs and said that the party hoped at least to neutralize his success on this issue.</p>
        <p>''Once we neutralize it, we can go back to our issues of character, integrity and leadership,'' one strategist said.</p>
        <p>There seemed little concern among Republican officials that the party would be branded as the first to go negative in what has rapidly become the opening round of the fall campaign. Their real concern is that Mr. Gore has successfully pivoted into the fall campaign by discussing an issue voters care about.</p>
        <p>And with that pivot, Mr. Gore, after months of stasis, began setting the campaign agenda at a time when the Bush campaign has appeared off-course. Republicans have been watching Mr. Gore's favorable rating rise in polls and his unfavorable rating fall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush on Wednesday canceled a commercial that had been sent out to 350 television stations. It used excerpts from an interview with Mr. Gore from six years ago in which he said that President Clinton had never lied. The ambivalence over the commercial reflected a debate on how negative Mr. Bush should go against Mr. Gore and how soon.</p>
        <p>The emergence of the new commercial effectively answers that question, for now. The party and the campaign want to erode Mr. Gore's success; putting the attack in the mouth of an anonymous narrator in a commercial paid for by the party allows Mr. Bush to claim the high road but still get the message across.</p>
        <p>In the commercial, Mr. Bush says:  ''Every senior will have access to prescription drug benefits.''</p>
        <p>''This is one of the issues on which he has had an advantage over us,'' one Republican strategist said of Mr. Gore. ''This is a recognition that Gore has gotten people talking about this issue and it ranks in the double-digits with people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush says he favors prescription drug coverage for those on Medicare. But he has not set any money aside for it. Mr. Gore has earmarked $253 billion over 10 years for providing prescription drugs through Medicare. Mr. Bush has said that Medicare should cover the entire cost of health care, including the cost of drugs, for low-income older Americans, but the Gore campaign says that this excludes too many people.</p>
        <p>The commercial is intended for undecided voters, which means it has to run several times before the message sinks in. It is to run in Arkansas, Delaware, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.</p>
