        <p>The bodies of two emotionally disturbed teenagers from Brooklyn who disappeared after jumping into the Hudson River on Tuesday have been found, and the group home supervisor who took them to the river's edge has resigned, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The bodies of the boys, Arimendis Lajara, 15, and Cedric Florence, 17, were found 12 hours apart. They had disappeared at the confluence of the Hudson and Croton Rivers in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. They were identified by relatives, said the Westchester County medical examiner, Millard J. Hyland.</p>
        <p>Cedric's body was found about 8 p.m. Thursday about 70 yards west of Tellers Point, the southernmost point of Croton Point Park. He died of asphyxia by drowning, Mr. Hyland said. An autopsy is scheduled today for the second boy, whose body was pulled from the water at 9:50 a.m. yesterday about half a mile away.</p>
        <p>The boys, who lived in a group home on the grounds of the Brooklyn Children's Psychiatric Center, had been on a camping trip. They were hiking with four other boys and a supervisor, Lenox Gabriel, down a steep path to the water's edge when three of the boys jumped, fully clothed, into the water. Mr. Gabriel jumped in to try to save them; one boy managed to swim to shore, but the others disappeared in a treacherous spot where the rivers converge and crosscurrents can swiftly overwhelm swimmers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gabriel, who had to be pulled from the water himself, was hospitalized and released. He has since resigned as community residence manager of the group home, said Roger Klingman, a spokesman for the State Office of Mental Health, which operates the Brooklyn hospital and the group home where the boys lived. Mr. Klingman said he did not know when Mr. Gabriel had resigned, or if he had given a reason.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gabriel, 47, worked for the agency for just under a year; he had earlier worked in a similar job for a nonprofit agency in the metropolitan area, Mr. Klingman said. He would not say exactly where Mr. Gabriel had worked, however, citing confidentiality laws governing workers' employment history.</p>
        <p>The police said Mr. Gabriel had told them that he never intended to take the boys swimming; he and other counselors on the trip had been warned against going in the water.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gabriel did not respond to messages left at his Brooklyn home yesterday. A woman who answered the phone, and said she was a neighbor looking after him, said that he had been upset by news media coverage of the drowning and that he had no comment.</p>
        <p>Criminal and departmental investigations by the Westchester County police and the Office of Mental Health are continuing.</p>
        <p>''There are some loose ends we still have to tie up and some people we have to talk to yet,'' said Louis D'Aliso, commissioner of public safety for Westchester County.</p>
        <p>An intensive search for the boys that involved several agencies, including the United States Coast Guard, shifted from a rescue effort to a recovery mission on Thursday, when, after 48 hours of searching, officials began to lose hope of finding the boys alive.</p>
        <p>The recovery of their bodies, however grim, was nonetheless a source of relief for the boys' families, who said it brought an end to the uncertainty and allowed them to arrange burials. Carlise Florence, Cedric's mother, drove from her Brooklyn home to Westchester to identify her son's body.</p>
        <p>Cindy Martinez, Arimendis's cousin, said his father, who also lives in Brooklyn, had identified the body.  ''We are relieved that we found the body, but we are sad that he is not alive,'' she said. ''I wish they would have found him lying down on the beach or something.''</p>
        <p>A boater spotted Arimendis's body floating in the water yesterday, in an area where swimming is allowed, said Detective Alison Carpentier of the county police.</p>
        <p>The other boy's body was recovered by a member of the Coast Guard Auxiliary, Gregory F. Porteus, who had been alerted by a water scooter rider. Officials said the bodies were clad in shorts and sandals only, and theorized that the boys had shed their clothing in an effort to save themselves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Porteus, 44, who lives in nearby Ossining, said a sandbar where the water is about three feet deep lies  only about 100 feet south of the point where the boys went into the river.  ''If they could have only made it to there, they would have made it,'' he said. ''They would have survived.''</p>
