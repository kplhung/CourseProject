        <p>Mary R Lefkowitz Op-Ed article on an airline flight she took a few months ago in which the prospect of a firey death loomed very large until the bauky landing gear finally descended; says she and other passengers were uncannily calm, experiencing a terror so anesthetizing that it could pass for courage (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A few months ago I was on a plane that almost crashed. For the first three hours it was a routine flight from Boston to Denver, crowded, with sporadic food and beverage service. Then, an hour before our scheduled landing, the pilot announced that one set of the plane's landing wheels would not descend.  But, he assured us, he could land the plane safely on two wheels. Although fire trucks would meet us on the ground, he said, there was no need to be concerned. They were simply being cautious. They liked to use occasions like this for practice. Was there really nothing to worry about? I wondered. None of the other passengers seemed particularly concerned.</p>
        <p>But about half an hour later the mood in the cabin changed when the pilot made a second announcement:  The situation was deteriorating badly. None of the landing wheels could descend. We would need to fly around in circles at a low altitude, the pilot explained, to burn up most of the fuel so that the plane would not catch fire when we landed on its metal belly. The crew pointed out the exits and explained how we should brace ourselves for landing. They spoke reassuringly but looked tense and worried. They told us to strap ourselves in tightly and stow our carry-on baggage. The cabin lights were extinguished. No one said a word. I looked at my husband; we were both speechless.</p>

        <p>A few months ago I was on a plane that almost crashed. For the first three hours it was a routine flight from Boston to Denver, crowded, with sporadic food and beverage service. Then, an hour before our scheduled landing, the pilot announced that one set of the plane's landing wheels would not descend.  But, he assured us, he could land the plane safely on two wheels. Although fire trucks would meet us on the ground, he said, there was no need to be concerned. They were simply being cautious. They liked to use occasions like this for practice. Was there really nothing to worry about? I wondered. None of the other passengers seemed particularly concerned.</p>
        <p>But about half an hour later the mood in the cabin changed when the pilot made a second announcement:  The situation was deteriorating badly. None of the landing wheels could descend. We would need to fly around in circles at a low altitude, the pilot explained, to burn up most of the fuel so that the plane would not catch fire when we landed on its metal belly. The crew pointed out the exits and explained how we should brace ourselves for landing. They spoke reassuringly but looked tense and worried. They told us to strap ourselves in tightly and stow our carry-on baggage. The cabin lights were extinguished. No one said a word. I looked at my husband; we were both speechless.</p>
        <p>As we flew around in silence, I tried to imagine, as calmly as I could, what would happen. I knew that no one walks away from a plane crash. Even if our plane did not explode when it hit the ground, chances were it would be engulfed in flames soon after. The seats my husband and I sat in were equidistant from two exits but close to neither. The chances of our escaping were almost nil. There was nothing, absolutely nothing, I could do. And so we all sat there in the eerie silence.</p>
        <p>Then suddenly, just as we were scheduled to land, the pilot announced that the landing gear had descended. We would have an ordinary landing after all. The passengers applauded and began talking excitedly. The pilot landed the plane expertly and switched off the engines. I saw that we had come in at a remote part of the vast Denver airport, surrounded by fire engines and men in heat-reflecting fire suits. We were towed to the gate and greeted by television crews. They asked earnestly: What did it feel like? What did you think about? I told them what happened, but not how I felt. At the time, I couldn't put it into words.</p>
        <p>Why was I so inarticulate? As a professor, I have spent most of my life explaining all sorts of complicated things to other people. But facing imminent death turned out to be different from what I had thought it would be. I would not have imagined that I could be so calm and deliberate, that I would spend what I supposed were my last few minutes of life thinking about something other than myself and what I was losing.</p>
        <p>My life did not pass before my eyes. Instead, I thought of the people on airplanes that had crashed. The  ''black boxes,'' when recovered, can reveal what a flight's crew was saying. But there is no way to know what was going through the passengers' minds when they realized that their plane was about to fall from the sky.</p>
        <p>Are the passengers on the planes that actually crash as uncannily calm as we all were -- silent, unlamenting, bracing ourselves in the dark cabin? Do they, before the last moments, experience, as we did, a terror so anesthetizing that it could  pass for courage?</p>
