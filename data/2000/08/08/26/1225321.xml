        <p>Cedric Kauffmann was a long shot to compete in this week's United States Open qualifying. Now he is on the verge of making the main draw.</p>
        <p>Kauffmann, who is from a suburb of Paris, is No. 312 in the ATP ranking. With little chance of playing at all, he flew to New York as the second alternate for the qualifying rounds.</p>
        <p>But the first alternate, Karsten Braasch, reported 15 minutes late to Monday's sign-in, so Kauffmann replaced him. On Tuesday, Gregory Carraz pulled out of the competition with an injury, allowing Kauffmann into the bracket.</p>
        <p>The 24-year-old Kauffmann has pounced on the opportunity. In the first round he defeated Marcos Ondruska, once ranked 26th, in straight sets. Yesterday he beat another tour veteran, Marc-Kevin Goellner, 7-6 (4), 7-5. To get into the main draw, which begins Monday, Kauffmann must defeat the journeyman Mark Knowles today.</p>
        <p>''I'll probably be nervous in the warm-up, but after that I'll be fine,'' said Kauffmann, a baseline specialist with quick feet. ''I have nothing to lose. I got very, very lucky. This is a chance of a lifetime.''</p>
        <p>Kauffmann has made $7,500 for reaching the final qualifying round, nearly twice as much as his prize money total for the year. He plays mostly in entry-level professional tournaments called Futures. In his last Futures event, he earned $117 for losing in the first round.</p>
        <p>Staying at a friend's apartment in Brooklyn, Kauffmann takes the subway to the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.</p>
        <p>Kauffmann, who earned a finance degree at the University of Kentucky, is not banking on an athletic career. Every day he stops at a Kinko's near Grand Central Terminal to check his stocks on the Internet.</p>
        <p>''I'll make more money in finance than I ever will in tennis,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Vinck Qualifies</p>
        <p>Christian Vinck of Germany is the only player to beat Andre Agassi in Las Vegas, Agassi's hometown. Vinck, who accomplished that feat at a minor tournament in 1997, updated his resume yesterday by qualifying for the Open with a 6-1, 6-2 third-round victory over James Sekulov.</p>
        <p>Olympians Fare Well</p>
        <p>Olympians in the Sydney Games had a good day yesterday. Sebastien Lareau of Canada earned a spot in the Open's main draw by defeating Hugo Armando, 6-4, 6-3. Alex O'Brien, a doubles specialist, is a victory away from qualifying for singles after he beat Michael Kohlmann, 7-6, 6-3. Other second-round winners in the men's bracket were Wayne Black of Zimbabwe and Barry Cowan of Britain.</p>
        <p>On the women's side, Petra Mandula will have a chance at the main draw before she represents Hungary in the Games. Mandula defeated Anca Barna of Germany, 2-6, 7-5, 6-0. Janet Lee, who was born in Lafayette, Ind., but will represent Taiwan in the Olympics, needed three sets to beat Anna Zarska of Poland, 6-0, 3-6, 6-0. Lee must win her match today to make the Open.</p>
        <p>Lucic Coming Back</p>
        <p>Mirjana Lucic took another step toward rebuilding her career by winning her third straight match to qualify for the main draw. Lucic, whose WTA ranking has plummeted to 202nd from 32nd, dropped the first set to Sandra Nacuk and was down, 0-2, in the second before rebounding for a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory.</p>
        <p>Motivated to Win</p>
        <p>Declaring that he would rather qualify as a winner than a lucky loser, Israel's Harel Levy trounced Rodolphe Cadart, 6-1, 6-0. As the top-ranked qualifier, Levy was assured of a spot in the main draw.</p>
