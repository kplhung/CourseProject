        <p>Not since Ronald Reagan in 1980 has a Republican nominee's promise of a sweeping tax cut played so dominant a role in the presidential race. The New York Times asked a number of business executives, scholars and politicians to assess Gov. George W. Bush's tax plan.</p>
        <p>Henry Kaufman  President  Henry Kaufman &amp; Company  Financial management and consulting</p>
        <p>I really believe that at this stage of our economic expansion, where the economy continues to be very strong and has a high utilization of labor resources as well as factory resources, he should pursue a very conservative fiscal policy. And therefore significant tax cuts should be postponed until the American economy slows down significantly or falls into a business recession. Small tax cuts here and there are all right, but significant tax cuts are inappropriate for the current setting.</p>
        <p>I also believe that continued large reductions of the government's debt would be most helpful in sustaining the very favorable current climate in both the bond and stock markets.</p>
        <p>You have to put this into two stages: the immediate impact on the financial markets and the economy, and the longer-term impact. Major tax cuts over the very near term will be adverse to the current favorable economic and market climate. Cuts over the longer term can be phased in, but should only begin when the economy slows down very sharply.</p>
        <p>Ronald Bullock  President  Bison Gear and Engineering Company  Maker of electric gear motors</p>
        <p>I think it is good to be giving money back to the people who have paid for getting us to the balanced budget. From my vantage point as a small-business owner, the last tax increase, in 1993, the big increase that funded the budget surplus, it has cut into the amount that we have left to reinvest into the company. And reinvestment creates jobs.</p>
        <p>I'm not complaining that we have come as far as we have in reducing the budget deficit and creating a surplus. I am not begrudging the taxes that I have paid. But now maybe it is time to free up some capital for additional investment. With interest rates as high as they are, it would be good to offset this through a tax reduction that allows us to retain more for investment.</p>
        <p>Richard Nelsen  Economics professor  Columbia University</p>
        <p>I want to comment not so much on the details of the Bush tax reduction plan as on aspects of the economic philosophy behind its size. The sometimes implicit but often explicit theory is that private spending at the margin is much more socially valuable than public spending. Hence, the relaxation of the fiscal constraint should be largely done through tax cuts and increased private spending rather than by putting more funds into certain public programs, although Bush has made defense an exception.</p>
        <p>But presently this society is not spending enough on schools to prevent many of them from physically crumbling. Our airport space and traffic control systems are greatly overstretched, causing misery for American passengers. Many of our public parks are a disgrace in terms of their maintenance. All of this is lost from view and implicitly denied in a tax cut proposal that only sees benefits from increased private spending, as the Bush proposal does.</p>
        <p>Dean Baker  Co-director  Center for Economic and Policy Research</p>
        <p>It really makes no economic or social sense. From an economic standpoint, it is not clear that we would want to stimulate the economy at this point. But if we did, cutting taxes for wealthy people, which is what Bush mainly proposes, would not be the way to do it. There is very little argument for his tax cut in terms of economic incentives, since much of it goes to reducing the marriage tax and the inheritance tax, which barely change incentives at all.</p>
        <p>From a social standpoint, the vast majority of these cuts are going to the wealthiest people, who have already prospered tremendously in the last decade. If we want to be giving money to anyone, we should be looking to give it to the working poor and to middle-class workers, the vast majority of whom get very little under this plan.</p>
        <p>Richard Sylla  Professor of financial history  Stern School of Business, New York University</p>
        <p>The projected budget surpluses are very large, so there is room to have tax cuts of the magnitude he is proposing, as well as some increases in public spending. Every penny does not have to go into debt retirement.</p>
        <p>And he makes a good point: People are saying, ''This is really our money, not the government's money.'' That really resonates.</p>
        <p>Al Gore will say the Bush cuts favor the rich, but to my mind it is well known that the people at the upper income levels pay most of the taxes, so any tax cut is going to seem to favor the rich. If when the government needs more money you put it mainly on the rich, eventually you find that the rich are paying most of the taxes. So any cut will favor them.</p>
        <p>Alan J. Auerbach  Economics professor  University of California at Berkeley</p>
        <p>Taken as a whole, the Bush tax cut is not good economic policy, because it's too massive. The revenue losses are quite substantial and would grow over time. The current budget situation, although certainly more favorable than it appeared a few years ago, is still such that the short-run surpluses overstate the long-run fiscal stance of the government. And we are overstating the short-run surpluses to the extent they incorporate funds that shouldn't be considered available or depend on questionable assumptions.</p>
        <p>While the on-budget surplus doesn't include the Social Security surplus, it does include the Medicare and government retirement programs, which, by the logic that leaves the Social Security surplus off budget, also shouldn't be available for tax cuts or spending. And among the surplus base lines made available by the Congressional Budget Office, there isn't one that would keep spending in line with the growth of the overall economy. All the base lines assume a continuing decline in the share of G.D.P. devoted to domestic discretionary spending.</p>
        <p>Senator Paul Wellstone  Democrat of Minnesota</p>
        <p>It's like the old Yiddish proverb that you can't dance at two weddings at the same time. When you look at the arithmetic, you can't have these massive tax cuts and at the same time leave no child behind. You can't do that and be a compassionate conservative. If you're going to make an investment in the health, skills, intellect and character of children in America, you can't do it on a tin-cup budget. With the kind of tax cuts Bush wants, there's nothing left. You can't have it both ways.</p>
        <p>That was the great ideological victory of President Reagan. You can argue that his tax cuts were regressive, but the real point was that they so eroded the revenue base that they made any kind of investment look fiscally irresponsible, which was probably what he wanted and believed in. But that approach doesn't work for Governor Bush, who wants to be seen as a compassionate conservative. He can't live up to his own rhetoric.</p>
        <p>Senator Connie Mack  Republican of Florida</p>
        <p>The Bush plan is a broad tax cut that gives tax reductions to every income group in America. It does so through the reduction of marginal tax rates, which we believe encourages savings and investment. That's an economic policy.</p>
        <p>Gore, on the other hand, has specific, targeted tax cuts, which basically say to people, ''If you act the way government wants you to act, you will get to keep some of your money.'' I don't think that's economic policy; it's a social-engineering concept.</p>
        <p>The Bush plan has a very positive effect on job creation. Today most small businesses pay taxes through individual income tax rates. By reducing marginal individual rates, it reduces the burden on small businesses. It would also increase savings for education and increase investment in scientific research and the development of new technology. It's new technology that will allow America to remain the most competitive economy in the world.</p>
        <p>Richard F. Syron  Chairman and chief executive  Thermo Electron Corporation  Instrument manufacturer</p>
        <p>Either the Gore or Bush proposal has laudable objectives. But the first question you have to ask yourself is, What is broken in the economy? If it is not broken, what are you doing? I would be quite careful about fiscal stimulus from either the tax side or the spending side. Most of our attention should be focused on paying down the national debt, because we have far too low a personal savings rate.</p>
        <p>The criticism of my view will be that it's traditional economics. My answer is that long-term productivity gains and long-term growth come from investment. Investment has to be financed from savings. Therefore, keeping personal savings as high as possible is desirable.</p>
        <p>Lawrence Kudlow  Chief U.S. investment strategist  ING Barings</p>
        <p>George Bush's tax-cutting plan will nurture Internet prosperity by reducing personal tax rates, eliminating the estate tax, ameliorating the marriage penalty and easing penalties on successful low-end wage earners. It will also prevent Washington from gobbling up the barrel of overflowing surpluses. The plan uses only a quarter of the $4.6 trillion budget surpluses expected over the next 10 years. It does not touch Social Security surpluses, and leaves $700 billion for debt reduction and other priorities. Positive economic incentive effects from reduced marginal tax rates will push out the aggregate supply curve to more than absorb demand increases without raising prices. No need for Fed tightening.</p>
        <p>Edward Yardeni  Chief investment strategist  Deutsche Bank Securities</p>
        <p>As a taxpayer, I love the concept. As an economist, I would rather let the surpluses accumulate until we have paid off all of the outstanding $3 trillion in publicly held U.S. federal debt. Then we can revisit proposals for cutting taxes. Paying off the debt will give many Americans an effective tax cut by lowering mortgage-financing costs. I estimate the 10-year government bond yield could fall to 4 percent by the middle of the decade if the surpluses continue to accumulate as projected by the C.B.O. In this scenario, fixed-rate 30-year mortgage yields could fall to 6.5 percent.</p>
        <p>As an economist, I also know that forecasting is hazardous work. Legislating a huge multiyear tax cut now, based on projections of the federal surplus, is questionable.</p>
