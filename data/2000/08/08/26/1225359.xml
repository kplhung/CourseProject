        <p>The management of the Port Authority Bus Terminal near Times Square believes a half-ton version of the actor Jackie Gleason would make commuting more enjoyable for the 185,000 bus passengers who catch a bus there daily.</p>
        <p>The promoters of the cable television channel TV Land, which has relaunched the 1950's series ''The Honeymooners,'' couldn't agree more.</p>
        <p>You can draw your own conclusion beginning Monday morning.</p>
        <p>In a ceremony that will feature Joyce Randolph, who played Trixie on the series, an eight-foot bronze statue of Mr. Gleason as the Brooklyn bus driver Ralph Kramden will be mounted outside the Eighth Avenue entrance to the nation's busiest bus terminal.</p>
        <p>Not to worry if the sidewalk gets a bit squeezed with the bigger-than-life Mr. Gleason, the management says.</p>
        <p>''The congestion that you envision happens during the rush periods,'' said Cedrick T. Fulton, general manager of the bus terminal. ''The majority of the hours of the day, that situation doesn't exist.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fulton sees the statue as art in a public space, part of the terminal's effort to make the commuting experience a memorable one. (Other components include cleanliness, security and punctuality, he said.) He envisions bus passengers stopping to have their pictures taken with the statue.</p>
        <p>TV Land says it is ''honoring a public icon.'' The channel paid for the statue, but it is not being charged a promotional or advertising fee by the Port Authority.</p>
        <p>Rob Pellizzi, vice president for marketing at TV Land, says the statue belongs to a publicity campaign that ''has been concentrated on the biggest bang.''</p>
        <p>The channel has shown television advertisements with Art Carney's character from the show, Ed Norton, dancing to the song ''Wild Thing.'' It has also painted buses from top to bottom with scenes from the series and Mr. Gleason behind the wheel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pellizzi said the channel was thinking of promoting its other shows with ''similar partnerships'' across the country.</p>
        <p>How sweet it is.</p>
