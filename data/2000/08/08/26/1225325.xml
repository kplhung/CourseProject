        <p>Body parts found in a suitcase in the Hudson River and a plastic bag in the East River last week are those of  a 17-year-old who was living with her boyfriend and infant son in the Bronx, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The police said the woman, Lisa Lennon, and her boyfriend lived with their 10-month-old son at 1113 Ward Avenue, in the Bronx River neighborhood. She was identified through a thumb print on record with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Neighbors said Ms. Lennon was from Jamaica.</p>
        <p>One neighbor said that she had not seen Ms. Lennon for at least two weeks and that her boyfriend also appeared to be missing in recent days. Ms. Lennon's son is with his maternal grandmother, in Mount Vernon, the police said.</p>
        <p>The neighbor, who declined to be named, saying she feared retribution, said that Ms. Lennon held down several jobs and was recently employed at a nearby Burger King, but that she had dreamed of opening a day care center.</p>
        <p>The police are investigating Ms. Lennon's death as a homicide. They had been trying to identify her since her head, legs and arms were found last week.</p>
