        <p>An advocacy group said yesterday that low attendance in summer school in New York City had been caused in part by the failure of the school system to communicate with immigrant parents in their native languages in a timely manner.</p>
        <p>The group, Advocates for Children, said its findings were based on an unscientific survey of 1,100 immigrant and refugee parents and students from schools across the city.</p>
        <p>More than half the school-age children in New York City come from immigrant households. Only 18 percent of the students and parents surveyed said that English is their native language, and 85 percent said that their summer school notification letter was written in English, the group's report showed.</p>
        <p>The survey was given to 650 students enrolled in 173 summer schools and 457 parents with children in 104 schools.</p>
        <p>''What was most disappointing about our survey results was finding that some of the simplest things to improve attendance were not done, like telling parents in a language they could understand that their child needed to attend summer school,'' said Margie McHugh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, an umbrella organization for 200 groups that worked with Advocates for Children to conduct the survey. She said that the failure to communicate in some cases led to the low attendance rate.</p>
        <p>Summer school attendance was a top priority for school officials, but  12.1 percent of the 62,537 students who were required to attend classes did not enroll.</p>
        <p>The study released yesterday also found that less than 25 percent of parents said they were notified that their child would probably have to attend summer school by the Jan. 31 deadline -- the date by which the Board of Education said that 86 percent of parents had received letters.</p>
        <p>Less than half of the students surveyed said that they had received remedial help to avoid summer school, the study showed. All failing or borderline students are supposed to receive remedial help before being required to attend summer school.</p>
        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, who was nearing the end of a vacation, said yesterday that he had not yet read the report. But he lambasted Jill Chaifetz, executive director of Advocates for Children, for not sharing the results sooner.</p>
        <p>''To make criticisms after the fact, when there is no opportunity to address the problem, is irresponsible,'' Mr. Levy said. ''I welcome the advocacy community. But public education should not be used for target practice.''</p>
