        <p>Randy Johnson grudgingly handed Buck Showalter the baseball in the third inning and instantly began inspecting the grass at Shea Stadium. One step, two steps and three steps turned into a dozen quick steps, and Johnson never looked up. He did not need to see anything. Johnson could hear the raucous response to his awful pitching and that was disturbing enough.</p>
        <p>Finally, about 20 feet from the dugout, Johnson peeked up, saw a few fans giddily waving goodbye and went back to studying the blades of grass. Johnson trudged down the dugout steps, made a right turn and vanished. Officially, that is. He really started to disappear in the second inning after his fastball lacked zest, his control was erratic and the Mets crept inside his cranium.</p>

        <p>Randy Johnson grudgingly handed Buck Showalter the baseball in the third inning and instantly began inspecting the grass at Shea Stadium. One step, two steps and three steps turned into a dozen quick steps, and Johnson never looked up. He did not need to see anything. Johnson could hear the raucous response to his awful pitching and that was disturbing enough.</p>
        <p>Finally, about 20 feet from the dugout, Johnson peeked up, saw a few fans giddily waving goodbye and went back to studying the blades of grass. Johnson trudged down the dugout steps, made a right turn and vanished. Officially, that is. He really started to disappear in the second inning after his fastball lacked zest, his control was erratic and the Mets crept inside his cranium.</p>
        <p>The Mets continued their stunning dominance over Johnson by pounding him and the Arizona Diamondbacks, 13-3, last night. It was the fourth straight time the Mets treated the best pitcher in the National League like a pitcher who had stumbled off a sandlot field. Johnson had no strikeouts for the first time in over 11 years and lasted two and a third innings.</p>
        <p>''Nothing worked,'' Johnson said. ''I go out there and pitch; if everything is great, we win. Obviously, I didn't pitch very well.''</p>
        <p>This could be a memorable weekend for the Mets if they snare the next two from Arizona because it could be recalled as the weekend when they unofficially secured a postseason berth. The Mets lead the Diamondbacks by five and a half games for the National League wild card. If they increase it to seven and a half by tomorrow, it will be very difficult for Arizona to shrink that gap in five weeks.</p>
        <p>Mets Manager Bobby Valentine claimed that this series was ''pretty big,'' but not bigger than any other. That is wrong. A sweep would make the Mets feel more comfortable than they have felt all season.</p>
        <p>Remember how chaotic last September was for the Mets? They dropped seven straight games in the last two weeks of the regular season and almost botched a wild-card spot. This season could and should be different. The Mets are the best team in the major leagues since the All-Star Game break, and they can still catch the first-place Atlanta Braves in the N.L. East. But they can make September much less stressful by having a solid safety net in the wild-card race, a process that continued as they bashed Johnson (16-5) for six runs (three earned) on six hits last night and filled the Arizona clubhouse with puzzled expressions.</p>
        <p>''I don't think amazed is the word,'' said Showalter, the Arizona manager. ''Maybe impressed.''</p>
        <p>Was Johnson amazed?</p>
        <p>''No, they're just a team,'' he said. ''Next question.''</p>
        <p>Johnson is intimidating because he is 6 feet 10 inches and fires a 98-mile-an-hour fastball that looks as if it were coming from 50 feet away after he completes his motion.</p>
        <p>''I think that there's intimidation when Randy Johnson pitches, with some hitters,'' Valentine said. ''I can't tell you about our guys.''</p>
        <p>That was Valentine's way of saying that the Mets are not intimidated. Why would they be? Johnson is 0-2 with a 7.11 earned run average against them this season, and he is 16-3 with a 2.10 E.R.A. against the rest of the league.</p>
        <p>Johnson's aggravation seemed to start in the first when a 2-1 fastball to Mike Piazza was called a ball. He dropped his hands to his side, glared at the umpire and then looked to center field. Johnson eventually induced a flyout, but it was the last time he was in control. The Mets clipped him for three runs in the second, aided by Matt Williams's error, and three more in the third, helped by Johnson's throwing error and Danny Bautista's circuitous route to a fly ball that turned into a two-run double. Johnson was flustered.</p>
        <p>''Once you have success against someone, you believe you can do it,'' Mets pitcher Al Leiter said. ''As dominant and nasty as Johnson is, you could tell that he wasn't the same against us. He lost his edge.''</p>
        <p>If the Mets maintain a strong cushion for the wild card, they can rest Piazza so he is not fatigued again and they can keep their pitchers fresh. They are two victories from feeling more secure, and they notched the most pivotal one against an intimidating pitcher who does not frighten them.</p>
        <p>''We hope to give our fans a pretty good show,'' said Valentine, referring to the weekend but hoping the show continues for two more months.</p>
