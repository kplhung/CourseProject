        <p>Correction: chart accompanying July 30 article on 10 largest donors to Republican National Committee included one company erroneously</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A chart on July 30 based on data from the Campaign Study Group, a nonpartisan research organization, about the 10 largest donors to the Republican National Committee, with an article about large, unregulated donations to the Republican Party, included one company erroneously. Sam Wyly, who founded Maverick Capital, and his brother Charles J. Wyly Jr. together donated $505,000 to the Republicans in this campaign, but they no longer have any relation to Maverick Capital; people connected with the company were not among the party's 10 biggest donors.</p>
        <p>The chart also described the company incorrectly. It is a money management firm, not a venture capital firm in the energy business.</p>
