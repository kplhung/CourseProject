        <p>Can Dick Cheney find a way to have his money and still avoid a possible conflict of interest over his options to buy stock in the Halliburton Company, which he headed until the Republican Party chose him as its candidate for vice president?</p>
        <p>The answer appears to be not with any certainty. Wall Street has a lot of products that use complicated derivative securities, and a cadre of people who design new ones, but tax experts say that none of them solve the problem of Mr. Cheney's having an economic interest in Halliburton -- at least not when taxes are considered.

        <p>Can Dick Cheney find a way to have his money and still avoid a possible conflict of interest over his options to buy stock in the Halliburton Company, which he headed until the Republican Party chose him as its candidate for vice president?</p>
        <p>The answer appears to be not with any certainty. Wall Street has a lot of products that use complicated derivative securities, and a cadre of people who design new ones, but tax experts say that none of them solve the problem of Mr. Cheney's having an economic interest in Halliburton -- at least not when taxes are considered. Perversely, the available strategies would leave him in a position to profit most if Halliburton's stock collapsed.</p>
        <p>''It appears to me that the only sure ways out would be for Halliburton's board to change the rules or for Congress to change the tax law,'' said David M. Schizer, an associate professor at Columbia Law School who specializes in tax law.</p>
        <p>The suggestion of a tax law change may not be completely frivolous. A highly technical change that would solve Mr. Cheney's problem has been proposed by the Clinton administration, Mr. Schizer said, but Congress has shown no interest in passing it.</p>
        <p>Though this problem affects only Mr. Cheney, it may in the future affect many other executives who leave companies for public service. Stock options have become common, and rules that delay exercising them are in place at virtually all the companies that issue them. Successful corporate executives are likely to have a significant part of their wealth tied up in options that cannot be immediately exercised unless their companies waive rules that apply to other employees with options.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's problem stems from the fact that the Halliburton board, in allowing him to take early retirement to join the Republican ticket, did not change when he could exercise the options. As a result, he must either forfeit them -- thus giving up millions in potential benefits -- or hold onto them until long after a new administration takes office.</p>
        <p>If he simply held them, every action by a Bush-Cheney administration would be scrutinized for whether it was helping Halliburton's stock price. That would be sensitive for any major company that has government contracts, but it would be particularly touchy for Halliburton, since the company is in the oil services industry and its stock price is heavily influenced by the price of oil, which could be affected by United States energy policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney has said that if elected, he will sell his stock in Halliburton before he takes office, but he has not said what he will do with the options other than assert that he will avoid a conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney has 400,000 stock options, of which 166,667 can be exercised this December, after the election but before the next administration takes office. He can exercise 133,333 options in December 2001 and 100,000 in December 2002.</p>
        <p>The nature of options means that their value can soar or fall far faster than the price of the underlying stock. For example, at $53 a share, near Halliburton's recent stock price, the options expiring in 2001 and 2002 would be worth $3.5 million.</p>
        <p>But if the price rose by $10 a share, a change of about 19 percent, the value of the options would leap 73 percent, to $6.1 million. If the price fell by $10, to $43, the value of the options would fall 66 percent, to $1.2 million.</p>
        <p>If one ignores tax considerations, there are several ways that Mr. Cheney could lock in the current price, minus some transaction costs. He could, for example, do a ''forward sale'' of Halliburton stock, delivering it only after the options could be exercised.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, noted Robert Willens, a tax expert with Lehman Brothers, the tax treatment would vary drastically depending on the market price when the option was exercised.</p>
        <p>If the stock rose a lot by the time he exercised the option, the result would be a lot of ordinary income, because profits from exercising employee stock options are based on the market price when the option is exercised. There would be a corresponding capital loss on the forward sale. But capital losses cannot be deducted from ordinary income above a $3,000 annual limit. If he did not have sufficient capital gains to offset those losses, he would face a large tax bill.</p>
        <p>How big could that be? Suppose Halliburton stock price is $50 when he does a forward sale and it rises to $80 by the time he exercises the 100,000 options that mature in 2002. Not counting taxes, he would take in $11.50 a share -- the difference between the $50 price he is getting and the $39.50 a share that he must pay Halliburton for the stock. His profit, pretax, would be $1.15 million.</p>
        <p>But the tax would be based on the difference between what he paid -- $39.50 -- and the $80 market value. So at the top federal rate of 39.6 percent, he would owe $1.16 million in taxes, $450,000 more than his actual profit.</p>
        <p>Partly offsetting that would be a large capital loss on the sale, of $30 a share, or $3 million. But if he had no capital gains from other investments, he could deduct only $3,000 of that from his income.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if Halliburton's stock fell, he would have less ordinary income and a capital gain on the forward sale. That would leave him in a far better tax position than if the stock went up.</p>
        <p>''The irony is that the derivatives position that leaves him with a neutral position pretax leaves him with an economic after-tax interest in the stock going down,'' said Mr. Schizer, whose article on issues regarding executive compensation, ''Executives and Hedging: The Fragile Legal Foundation of Executive Compensation,'' appeared in the March issue of the Columbia Law Review.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney could use other strategies, but each has its own tax consequences. Some would risk involving the ''constructive sale'' rules and force him to pay immediate taxes even before he realized any profits. And when the money came in after the options were exercised, the tax treatment would again vary markedly depending on whether the stock had risen or fallen in the interim.</p>
        <p>Tax experts differ on whether the constructive sales rules would apply in this case. But since there appear to be no precedents, it would be risky for Mr. Cheney to assume they did not. An executive unconcerned about appearances and merely looking to lock in some profit from his options would avoid those rules by leaving himself with some exposure to the stock, for example protecting him from losses if the shares fell below $50 and relinquishing gains if they rose above $60. But if Mr. Cheney followed that course, he would still have a stake in Halliburton -- the very appearance of a conflict of interest that the tactics are intended to avoid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney might also borrow money under a contract that required him to repay the loan with the stock he would get when he exercised the options. But that could leave him with a large expense -- deemed interest expense under the tax law -- that might not be deductible unless he had a lot of other investment income. In that case, he would suffer at tax time if the stock had risen sharply.</p>
        <p>All this could be avoided if Halliburton would let Mr. Cheney exercise the options before he took office. But that might anger other employees with options who did not have that right.</p>
        <p>Halliburton conceivably could amend its plan to let Mr. Cheney sell his options to someone else or enter into contracts that would let him deliver the options, rather than the shares, when they can be exercised. Then the tax laws would be simpler and the tax effect much more predictable, Mr. Schizer said.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has proposed a highly technical change in tax laws dealing with straddles, another strategy that Mr. Cheney might use. The proposal is aimed at what the administration considers a possible abuse of tax law now being used to shelter some income in transactions unrelated to Mr. Cheney's situation, and Congress has shown little interest in the measure.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Schizer said the proposed change would effectively allow Mr. Cheney to offset his losses and gains from one strategy, no matter how large they were, and thus lock in his profits now, before and after taxes.</p>
        <p>Yet another possible course Mr. Cheney could take would be to agree to donate the net profits to a charity after he was able to exercise the options. But there is a tax trap even in that strategy: the tax law limits the amount of charitable deductions to half of a person's income. Mr. Cheney might find that he had to pay taxes on some of the profits even after he had given them away. In that case, he could take deductions in future years but would have an immediate cash-flow problem.</p>
        <p>Politicians often complain that the tax laws are too complicated. Mr. Cheney, in trying to decide what to do about his options, might learn just how accurate that complaint is.</p>
