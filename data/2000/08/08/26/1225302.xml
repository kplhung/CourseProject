        <p>Europe is hardly in the midst of a major economic boom, but the European Central Bank is increasingly likely to hit the brakes as early as next week.</p>
        <p>In a series of hawkish warnings, the central bankers have made it clear that they are alarmed about inflation and the depressed value of the euro compared with the United States dollar. Most analysts predict the central bank's governors will increase interest rates when they meet next Thursday, but many worry that the move could stunt growth without shoring up the euro.</p>
        <p>''It is a self-produced problem,'' said Hans Meltzer, an economist at Deutsche Bank Research. ''If the E.C.B. were as generous about inflation as Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve, it wouldn't have a problem.''</p>
        <p>When the euro was introduced in January 1999, the European Central Bank announced that its goal was to keep inflation below 2 percent a year.  Ernst Welteke, president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, and a governor at the European Central Bank, drove home the nature of European worries in a toughly worded speech today.</p>
        <p>''The E.C.B. cannot be satisfied with the developments of the external value of the euro,'' Mr. Welteke said. Noting that the weak euro has led to sharply higher import prices, Mr. Welteke said the risks of inflation had increased measurably.</p>
        <p>Since its introduction, the euro has lost more than 20 percent of its value against the dollar. At its current value of about 91 cents, it remains near its all-time low of nearly 88 cents.</p>
        <p>The euro's weakness stems primarily from the drawing power of the American economy, which continues to attract huge amounts of foreign investment and thereby generate demand for dollars. The weak euro has aggravated inflationary dangers because it has pushed up the cost of imports, most particularly of oil. With prices still near their highest levels in years for oil, which is purchased exclusively in dollars, European fuel bills have pushed up the prices of other products. As a result, Europe's annualized rate of inflation is now about 2.4 percent. On Thursday, the German government reported that prices in German factories increased in July at the fastest rate in nearly a decade.</p>
        <p>But many economists argue that the inflation threat has been overstated. Mr. Meltzer of Deutsche Bank noted that most of the recent surge in prices stems from soaring oil prices rather than from more structural causes like rising wages. Stripped of oil and other volatile items, the core inflation rate is 1.3 percent. Many analysts are betting that central bankers will raise their baseline interest rates next week by one-half of a percentage point, from 4.25 percent to 4.75. That is still substantially lower than the United States federal funds rate of 6.50, , but it poses risks.</p>
        <p>The most obvious risk is that it will stop Europe's current economic upswing, just as unemployment in Germany and France is beginning to sink below 10 percent for the first time in years. If economic growth does slow, the decline could drive the value of the euro down. Though currencies normally rise when interest rates are increased, the euro's biggest source of weakness is Europe's slower economic growth compared with that of the United States.</p>
        <p>The currency risk was put into focus this week, when a closely watched survey of German business sentiment showed a sharp drop in confidence. The news quickly prompted some forecasters to conclude that German growth had peaked, and investors reacted by selling euros and briefly pushing their value below 89 cents.</p>
        <p>In hindsight, many analysts said they believed that the drop in confidence was misleading and that the German economy, Europe's biggest, still had room to grow. The German central bank has predicted that growth will approach 3 percent next year, and the Deutsche Bank predicts it will go slightly higher.</p>
        <p>But the fragility is clear. Recent data on Europe's trade balance showed that the weak euro continued to bolster exports by making them cheaper in world markets and that European imports were increasing. While part of that reflects exchange rate effects, Tony Norfield of ABN Amro theorized it might indicate a preference to buy imported goods.</p>
