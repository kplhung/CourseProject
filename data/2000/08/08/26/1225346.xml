        <p>Two elderly women have become seriously ill from the West Nile virus, bringing the number of those infected this summer to five, health officials said yesterday as they announced that the city would intensify its spraying of pesticides over the weekend in response.</p>
        <p>The number of people infected this year with the virus is sharply lower than it was at this point last year, when the West Nile virus first emerged in the Western Hemisphere and killed seven people in the New York metropolitan region. But while health officials were far more prepared this year to combat the spread of infected mosquitoes -- at this point last year, the city had yet to correctly identify the disease that was sickening residents -- the evolution and the spread of the disease are still confounding health experts as West Nile expands beyond municipal and state borders.</p>
        <p>And once again, officials are being forced to turn to costly pesticide spraying even though its efficacy is hard to know definitively.</p>
        <p>Staten Island has replaced Queens this year as the hot zone for the disease, in part, health officials and epidemiologists suggest, because its marshlands are havens for mosquitoes. But other factors may be influencing the shift, including a change in how birds in different areas of the city responded to the virus this year.</p>
        <p>As it stands, all but one of the human cases this year were diagnosed on Staten Island, and pools of water there bearing infected mosquitoes far outnumber those of other boroughs -- 65 to date, versus just 3 in Queens. In addition, 40 birds on Staten Island have been found to be carrying the virus, which is 60 percent of infected birds found this year.</p>
        <p>One of the two women whose cases were disclosed yesterday is an 87-year-old from Borough Park who was admitted to a Brooklyn hospital on Aug. 7 for surgery and who developed encephalitis on Aug. 15. She later suffered seizures and is now in a coma in critical condition. The other woman, who is 84, is in stable condition at Staten Island University Hospital after becoming ill on Aug. 18 with encephalitislike symptoms. She was admitted to the hospital last Sunday. Initial tests indicated that both women had contracted the West Nile virus. Officials would not release the victims' names.</p>
        <p>It is still too early to draw definite conclusions about the final path that West Nile will take this year. Health officials have long warned that the next two-week period is likely to yield the greatest number of sick people. But some interesting distinctions have emerged.</p>
        <p>One is clearly that for all the difficulties in predicting the ways of the illness -- where it will emerge the strongest, who is most vulnerable to it, what will combat it best -- the state has done a formidable job of warding off a larger calamity this year.</p>
        <p>By this point last summer, 10 people had been identified as having fallen ill with West Nile and one would soon die, though health officials mistakenly thought it was St. Louis encephalitis that was causing the illnesses. Spreading larvicide and conducting a public information campaign intended to rid the city of standing pools of water and to encourage residents to reduce bites by wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts contributed to the smaller numbers of cases, experts agreed.</p>
        <p>''The various things that the state and city have done to reduce exposure has undoubtedly had a positive effect on reducing cases,'' said Ward Stone, chief wildlife pathologist for the State Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
        <p>And while officials had their eyes glued on Queens this spring, the majority of infected birds, infected mosquitoes and human illnesses have come from Staten Island. Experts said this might be because birds in Queens had developed immunity to the virus, and as the disease spread,  Staten Island birds, which were barely exposed last year, might be especially vulnerable.</p>
        <p>''There seem to be too many immune birds for the infection to be doing well in Queens,'' said Andrew Spierman, a professor of tropical public health at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''Immune birds inhibit transmission, because mosquitoes need to feed on infected birds to transmit.''</p>
        <p>And clearly the disease continues to spread far and wide. In Suffolk County, 56 birds carrying West Nile have been identified by Mr. Stone's laboratory, and 104 are still being examined. In Rockland County, the number of birds testing positive for the virus has risen to 85. And Mr. Stone said that birds with the virus had been detected from Niagara Falls to the easternmost part of Pennsylvania to Oswego County. ''If we don't get every county in the state by the end of the year I'll be surprised,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And so officials have had little choice but to resume the spraying that they had hoped this spring to avoid. Ground spraying began last night in the Bronx, where a new mosquito pool was identified, and in large swaths of Brooklyn, including Prospect Park. Spraying in other areas of both boroughs will continue throughout the weekend, and Staten Island will get ground and aerial spraying Sunday and into next week.</p>
        <p>But experts agree that the effect of spraying can never really be quantified. ''There is always improvement, sure, but is it measurable, no, and is it significant, I don't know,'' said Mr. Spierman of Harvard. He added that ground spraying was particularly tricky, because wind must be present but not too strong to ensure the optimal effect. What is more, each spray of pesticide covers only 200 feet. He added that any obstacles to a truck's spray range, including the wind, contribute to a loss of efficacy.</p>
        <p>There may be a disconnect between what residents expect pesticides to accomplish and how much even large-scale efforts can do to stave off a pathogen on the run. ''You can never eliminate all cases,'' Mr. Spierman said, ''but the helicopter application makes a much greater reduction.''</p>
        <p>But spraying pesticides from helicopters is not only extremely expensive, it also tends to unnerve residents, even as they clamor for a West Nile-free city.</p>
        <p>When pressed to give his view of spraying, Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city's health commissioner, said: ''The new mosquito pools tell us that there is still active viral transmission even after spraying. At this point it is less severe than last year, but there is still cause for concern.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Cohen's comments came during a news conference held with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was in the awkward position of having minutes earlier announced erroneously, on his weekly radio show, the  death of one of the victims. The mayor said that he had been told the patient was likely to die, but that he had misheard.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 1, 2000, Friday  An article on Saturday about two new cases of illness in humans caused by the West Nile virus misstated the surname of a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who said it was possible that birds in Queens had developed immunity to the virus. He is Andrew Spielman, not Spierman.</p>
