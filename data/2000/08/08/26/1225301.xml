        <p>A lawyer for Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, denounced the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday for apparently leaking the information that Andersen is being investigated for its role in auditing the books of Waste Management Inc.</p>
        <p>''We are outraged by it,'' said David A. Barrett, a partner in the law firm of Boies Schiller &amp; Flexner, after The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the S.E.C. was looking into whether Andersen's independence had been compromised by its consulting for Waste Management.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett declined to say whether the report was accurate. Chris Ullman, a spokesman for the S.E.C., also declined to comment.</p>
        <p>It has been known for some time that the S.E.C. is investigating Waste Management.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett called it ''highly suspicious'' that the report came just as the S.E.C. was receiving comments on a proposed rule to limit consulting work that accounting firms can for their audit clients.</p>
