        <p>The Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York will sell its McBurney building in Chelsea under an agreement that will preserve the old structure's low-income housing and pave the way for the construction of a new health and fitness club on West 14th Street, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Critics of the original deal had noted that the sale of the McBurney building at 215 West 23rd Street would have displaced dozens of low-income residents at the Y, which is phasing out its single-room occupancy program. Under the compromise, the S.R.O. tenants would have the option of staying in the building on lower floors that would be owned by a nonprofit group that is an advocate for the poor.</p>

        <p>The Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York will sell its McBurney building in Chelsea under an agreement that will preserve the old structure's low-income housing and pave the way for the construction of a new health and fitness club on West 14th Street, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Critics of the original deal had noted that the sale of the McBurney building at 215 West 23rd Street would have displaced dozens of low-income residents at the Y, which is phasing out its single-room occupancy program. Under the compromise, the S.R.O. tenants would have the option of staying in the building on lower floors that would be owned by a nonprofit group that is an advocate for the poor.</p>
        <p>The top seven floors of the building, a city landmark, will be sold to Time Equities, a Manhattan residential development corporation, and converted into luxury apartments, Y.M.C.A. officials said. A lower, but smaller, part of the building will be  sold to the nonprofit group, Common Ground. The group plans to use the space for about 200 units of low-income housing, about the same number as the S.R.O. units now in the building.</p>
        <p>The current residents of the Y.M.C.A. building will be given the opportunity to obtain apartments in the renovated McBurney building from Common Ground, officials said. During the renovations, they will be offered temporary apartments at other Common Ground buildings.</p>
        <p>The agreement means that the Y.M.C.A. is one step closer to beginning construction within the next 10 to 15 months on the $29 million building it plans to open on West 14th Street. The building would be the first new Y.M.C.A. in Manhattan in 68 years, officials said. Plans call for the 14th Street Y.M.C.A. to have about 67,000 square feet -- the same  as the McBurney building -- but the building will not include low-income housing and will make better use of space, officials said.</p>
        <p>''The McBurney building is quite old, and it did not serve us very well,'' said Lenore Neier, a spokeswoman for the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York. Much of the space was staircases and hallways, she said. ''We will be using the same amount of space on two floors instead of nine floors, and get a state-of-the-art swimming pool.''</p>
        <p>In the years since the Y.M.C.A. moved into the current McBurney building in 1904, it has not only been a community center for its members, but has also stood as a symbol of the organization's longstanding commitment to providing low-income housing to New Yorkers in an increasingly shrinking landscape of single-occupancy residencies.</p>
        <p>But the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York, which operates nearly 200 camps and buildings in New York and upstate, including 19 centers in the city, has been saddled with many old buildings that are difficult to adapt to today's demands, officials said.</p>
        <p>They began exploring the possibility of renovating the armory, but it quickly became clear that serious structural problems would push costs to $11 million to $13 million, much higher than the $3 million they had expected. Y.M.C.A. officials continued with some of the renovations to the McBurney building, but also began planning for a new building on West 14th Street, one that could serve the same area, but would not include low-income housing. Y.M.C.A. officials said they were moving away from offering such services.</p>
        <p>At hearings and community board meetings, advocates for the poor said that they feared that the building would be sold to a developer who wanted to construct luxury apartments.</p>
        <p>Construction is expected to begin on the West 14th Street building next spring and be completed by 2003. Officials said that the Y.M.C.A. would not move out of the McBurney building until then.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, The Time Equities and Common Ground partnership is to pay $17.15 million for the McBurney building. The nonprofit group will set aside its space for homeless people, at-risk youth and low-income New Yorkers, while the Time Equities lofts will be sold at market rates.</p>
        <p>''We are thrilled that the former McBurney Y.M.C.A. will continue to be an affordable-housing residence in the Chelsea community,'' Rosanne Haggerty, the executive director of Common Ground, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, a Chelsea Democrat, has promised to secure $125,000 for the Common Ground project. Y.M.C.A. officials say they have been able to secure additional financing, including $250,000 each through C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, and Assemblywoman Deborah Glick of Chelsea.</p>
