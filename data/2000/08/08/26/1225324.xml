        <p>After two years of planning, 11 Indian tribes or tribal corporations from across the country, including the Mashantucket Pequots of Connecticut, have agreed to commit $1 million each to found the nation's largest intertribal bank ever.</p>
        <p>The Native American National Bank, which would have its headquarters in Denver, would be subject to the same laws and regulations as any other bank in the United States. It would focus initially on providing large-scale loans to Indian-owned businesses, though it would also invest in non-Indian companies, its members said. As a wholesale bank, it would not make small loans to individuals, at least at first.</p>
        <p>The bank's goal is to help alleviate the misery afflicting many American Indians by harnessing hundreds of millions of dollars to invest in bold new tribal ventures, like buffalo slaughterhouses in the Great Plains and lumber mills in the Northwest. The tribes say they hope to move rapidly into territory that commercial banks -- wary of the complications and risks associated with lending to Indian tribes that do not recognize many federal laws -- have long been reluctant to explore.</p>
        <p>But their plan faces formidable hurdles. Though they already have $11 million in pledges, the tribes are still seeking to raise another $19 million in start-up capital: $15 million in investments from large commercial banks and $1 million each from four additional tribes. And once the money is raised, the bank will need to attract hundreds of millions of dollars to invest, banking experts said. Typically, that investment capital comes from deposits, and Indian officials estimate that existing banks hold at least $200 million in deposits from tribes and their members.</p>
        <p>But there is great uncertainty about whether those depositors would turn their money over to the new bank, and whether there are enough profitable loans to be made to Indians and tribes, experts said.</p>
        <p>Native American National Bank expects to submit its federal charter application in October, said Tex Hall, the chairman of Native American National Bancorp, the bank's holding company, and of the Three Affiliated Tribes of North Dakota.</p>
        <p>If approved, the bank would be unique in several respects, tribal and banking industry officials said. With $30 million in projected start-up capital, it would be the largest financial institution ever created, owned and controlled solely by American Indians, and the first created specifically to invest primarily in other tribe-owned businesses.</p>
        <p>''You've never seen the tribes get together to do a banker's bank, one that would focus on transactions between tribes themselves,'' said Jan Kalmus, a national bank examiner and licensing expert with the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p>
        <p>The bank would also be unusual in taking on two roles at once: as a community bank serving Indians, and as a national bank making corporate-sized loans. Although it would be small for a bank with coast-to-coast ambitions, it would be much larger than most community banks.</p>
        <p>Starting Native American National Bank is necessary for several reasons, its members said. Foremost among them is a profound dissatisfaction with the federal government's tight hold on billions that tribes have amassed by leasing their land and from court settlements awarded to them over the decades. But they have not been able to use the money, which the government holds for them in trust.</p>
        <p>''If we don't do this, the federal government is going to continue to hold us hostage,'' Mr. Hall said. ''We have to capitalize our own private bank. What we're talking about is nation building, tribal nation building.''</p>
        <p>The idea to start a national Indian bank also comes at a time when extraordinary amounts of cash from casino gambling are tumbling into tribal coffers. The Foxwoods casino in Ledyard, Conn., for example, now has gross annual revenue of more than $1 billion, making the Pequot tribe one of the wealthiest in North America. The new bank would cater to managing such tribes' financial resources.</p>
        <p>Native American National Bank is part of a wave of banks owned, wholly or partially, by Indian tribes. There are 10 such banks in the United States and Canada, up from 3 in 1995, said J. D. Colbert, president of the North American Native Bankers Association. In 1972, a group of tribes from the Seattle area founded their own bank, American Indian National Bank, on a second floor of an office building in Washington, D.C., Mr. Colbert said. But, poorly run and underfinanced, the bank folded in the late 1980's, he said.</p>
        <p>Unlike that venture, Native American National Bank represents a broad coalition trying to create wealth among all tribes, Ms. Kalmus said.</p>
        <p>So far, the Pequots are the only tribe in the Northeast that has agreed to underwrite the bank. The other tribes, Mr. Hall said, are the Seminoles in Florida; the Cheyenne River Sioux in South Dakota; the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa in Michigan; the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa in Minnesota; the Ute Mountain Tribe in Colorado; the Tlingit and Haida tribes, jointly, in Alaska; the Arctic Slope Regional Corp., comprising several tribes in northern Alaska; the Navajo Tribe in Utah, Arizona and New Mexico; the Puyallup Tribe in Washington; and Mr. Hall's Three Affiliated Tribes in North Dakota.</p>
        <p>Richard A. Hayward, the Pequot tribe's vice chairman, who preceded Mr. Hall as chairman of the bank's holding company, committed to joining the bank late last year, said a tribal spokesman, Arthur Henick. Mr. Hayward declined to be interviewed.</p>
        <p>To raise half of the $30 million Indian leaders say they want to have before applying for a charter, Native American National Bancorp is also hoping to lure investments from three commercial banks: Bank of America, Bank One and Wells Fargo, Mr. Hall said. Investing in the tribal bank would help commercial banks fulfill federal requirements that they invest some assets in minority or community-based institutions.</p>
        <p>The bank is also seeking million-dollar commitments from an additional four tribes. Officials of the Mohegan tribe, in Montville, Conn., said they were considering joining the bank venture. ''It's very important for Indian tribes to be going into this venture,'' said Jayne G. Fawcett, the Mohegans' vice chairman.</p>
        <p>Tribal leaders said the move to start their own bank was a reaction to several recent trends. For one, the influx of millions of dollars from casino gambling revenue on reservations around the country has created a huge, unprecedented source of tribal capital, they said, and intensified the efforts of many tribes that do not have casinos to become financially independent.</p>
        <p>But on a deeper level they have also begun pressing the federal government to account for billions of dollars it has held in increasingly disorganized trust accounts on tribes' behalf. The trusts have been largely inaccessible to Indians since the mid-19th century, Indian officials said. ''The assumption back then was that Indians were basically incompetent to handle their financial affairs,'' Mr. Colbert said.</p>
        <p>Tribes have recently begun using aggressive measures to get control of that trust money. A federal lawsuit, brought by a Blackfeet tribal member in 1998, for instance, seeks to force the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs to hand over $3 billion to 300,000 individual Indians and hundreds of tribal governments nationwide. The suit is pending.</p>
        <p>There is another factor in the Indians' desire to bank for themselves: the obvious discomfort, on both sides, with Indians' borrowing from mainstream commercial banks.</p>
        <p>''They are a little fearful of giving Indians loans,'' Greg Bourland, chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe in South Dakota, said of the banks. Before they lend money to Indians, banks often require them to sign a waiver that prohibits the Indians from using their tribe's sovereign status as a shield to avoid legal disputes filed in United States courts. If the borrower agrees and then defaults, the bank can try to acquire a portion of tribal land, which the federal government holds in trust, banking experts said. Many Indians are loath to sign such a waiver.</p>
        <p>''That is a difficult legal, and certainly a difficult emotional, issue,'' said Ms. Kalmus. ''Native American National Bank would be very much more sensitive to those issues.''</p>
        <p>Stephen Fitzgerald, Bank of America's national program manager for Indian-related investments, said an Indian-owned national bank might be  more willing to subsidize tribal projects than banks like his.</p>
        <p>But banking experts say a national Indian-owned bank seeking to invest primarily in tribal ventures will face many obstacles. ''They're trying to serve a niche market that's spread over a broad geographic area,'' said Bert Ely, a banking industry consultant in Alexandria, Va.</p>
        <p>Tribal officials say the bank would  be adequately staffed to handle hundreds of million-dollar loans simultaneously. To build enough investment capital, a national bank should be able to attract about 10 times the amount in its start-up fund, banking experts said.</p>
        <p>''How quickly are they going to be able to reach that asset size?'' Mr. Ely asked.</p>
        <p>The new bank's chief executive, John Beirise, a former head of institutional banking at Mercantile Bancorporation Inc. in St. Louis, is writing the charter application, the document that holds the answers to many of these questions. He declined to be interviewed.</p>
