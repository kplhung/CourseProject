        <p>Bond prices were flat yesterday after the government reported a larger-than-expected drop in orders for durable goods in July, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may hold off raising interest rates again this year.</p>
        <p>By late in the day, the price of the 10-year note rose 1/32, to 105 9/32, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.71 percent from 5.72 percent on Wednesday. The 30-year bond rose 8/32, to 108 16/32. Its yield fell to 5.66 percent from 5.67 percent.</p>
        <p>The 12.4 percent plunge in durable goods orders last month was the largest on record and surpassed economists' expectations.</p>
        <p>Maury N. Harris, chief economist at PaineWebbber, said the ''orders data are consistent with our forecast for G.D.P. growth to slow in the third quarter to 3.3 percent at an annual rate after 5.2 percent growth in the second quarter.'' He said the numbers were consistent with forecasts that the Federal Open Market Committee, which next meets on Oct. 3, will remain on hold indefinitely. ''Nevertheless, one should not overreact to the weakness in these numbers.''</p>
        <p>Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Fleming Asset Management, said, ''Signs of a moderating economy, coupled with faster productivity growth that is helping to suppress inflationary tendencies, has given the Fed some breathing room in its quest to maneuver the economy into a soft landing.''</p>
        <p>''Furthermore,'' Mr. Fine said, ''the proximity of the presidential election makes it highly unlikely that any change in policy would be instituted at the Oct. 3 F.O.M.C. meeting. Thus if the Fed should deem additional tightening necessary, a clearly debatable point both inside and outside the F.O.M.C., the Nov. 15 meeting would appear to be the earliest conceivable date for further action.''</p>
        <p>While the Fed is still very sensitive to the potential for inflation in a vibrant economy with a 4 percent unemployment rate, Mr. Fine said, the Fed will remain on hold for an extended period of time unless economic growth picks up or inflationary pressures become threatening or both. He says neither appears imminent.</p>
        <p>With the Fed expected to adhere to an unchanged monetary policy, bonds are likely to trade in a range, Mr. Fine said.</p>
        <p>Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation in Boca Raton, Fla., also saw the bond market's lack of reaction to yesterday's data as a sign that it is trading well ahead of itself.</p>
        <p>''I think this economic slowdown is not as strong as what Treasury rates are telling us,'' he said. ''You just can't put a pen to paper to justify the current rates.''</p>
