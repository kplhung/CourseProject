        <p>Three days after planning to announce a trade of Patrick Ewing, two days after some reporters and many fans lambasted the longtime Knicks star as a failure and a boor, and one day after desperately working the phones in search of another deal, General Manager Scott Layden said that the franchise's creaky center would most likely begin his 16th professional season with the Knicks.</p>
        <p>In a conference call with reporters yesterday, Layden essentially shut the door on any semblance of the four-team, 13-player trade that would have sent Ewing to the Seattle SuperSonics and brought Vin Baker and Glen Rice to New York.</p>
        <p>Wally Walker, the Sonics' president and general manager, said yesterday that the deal was ''dead.''</p>
        <p>For now, Layden said, it looks as if the Knicks will battle the revamped Miami Heat, the new-look Orlando Magic and the familiar nemesis Indiana Pacers with Ewing, the lumbering 38-year-old post player who some believe has come to cramp the club's style.</p>
        <p>Asked if he expected Ewing to be the Knicks' starting center next season, Layden said, ''I think that's the way we're proceeding right now.''</p>
        <p>Layden, who except for a minor draft-day deal has yet to complete a move in his first summer with the Knicks, knows the awkward situation his club is facing. How do you welcome back a player who reportedly is bitter about your refusal to offer him a contract extension, whom you all but traded from his home of 15 years and who was roasted by the public and the press on his way out the door?</p>
        <p>The Knicks' approach is apparently to conduct severe damage control, and yesterday Layden did his best to put a favorable spin on the circumstances.</p>
        <p>''I think one thing about Patrick is that he's a consummate professional,'' Layden said. ''He's been in this business an awful long time. He understands the business. He always plays hard and gets himself ready in the off-season. I think he's going to do the same and have a great season this year, whatever awkward feelings there may be.</p>
        <p>''I expect him to really come back and have a great season for the Knicks. One thing I know is that when he runs through that tunnel at Madison Square Garden, there's going to be a standing ovation.''</p>
        <p>Layden, who admitted breaking with the franchise's policy of not discussing trades, portrayed the deal as a collaboration between the Knicks and Ewing and his agent, David Falk. He said the parties met earlier this summer and the consensus was to pursue a trade that pleased both sides, the implication being that Ewing was neither stunned nor hurt by the Knicks' willingness to move him. Layden added that he had been in contact with Ewing throughout the trade talks. Neither Ewing nor Falk could be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Though Layden said he expected Ewing to start training camp with the Knicks, he said the club would also continue to pursue trades.</p>
        <p>''Through our discussions, there was never any anger or bitterness in this process,'' Layden said. ''It's been handled completely on a professional level. Since Patrick has a no-trade clause in his contract, this is really a situation where we have to handle it in a team effort and work at this together to see if a situation makes sense. And clearly we'll only do what's right for everyone concerned.</p>
        <p>''If there is an opportunity for Patrick to get a fresh start but also -- and this is important -- the Knicks can improve their team, at that time we would consider making a trade.''</p>
        <p>As of Sunday, the Knicks thought they had that type of deal. They would have received Baker from the Sonics and Rice and the backup center Travis Knight from the Lakers and sent Ewing to Seattle, Chris Dudley to the Lakers and David Wingate to Detroit. The Lakers would also have received Christian Laettner from Detroit, and the Pistons would have gotten six marginal players to go along with Wingate.</p>
        <p>The trade collapsed when Detroit pulled out Monday night, in large part because of negative fan reaction after the proposed deal was reported in the news media.</p>
        <p>While some questioned whether adding the struggling Baker was a good move, Layden said he believed the trade would have strengthened the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''We felt comfortable that we were going to improve our team,'' Layden said.</p>
        <p>The prevailing notion is that deal was the Knicks' best chance to trade Ewing. Seattle, which faces its own troubling situation in having to bring back the disgruntled Baker, was hoping to add Ewing to its lineup, while  also acquiring Maurice Taylor, to potentially put itself in position to be nearly $20 million beneath the salary cap next summer.</p>
        <p>But Walker, the Sonics' president, said yesterday that the deal had been squashed and that Taylor would head elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Taylor, the Los Angeles Clippers' power forward, will most likely sign with the Houston Rockets.</p>
        <p>Layden said that Ewing and Falk did not demand a contract extension and that Ewing had not waived the no-trade clause in his contract. It was reported that Ewing gave the Knicks a list of eight teams -- Seattle, Washington, Portland, Indiana, Miami, Orlando, Phoenix and Toronto -- to which he would accept being traded after the Knicks refused to meet his demand for a two- or three-year contract extension.</p>
        <p>''At no time did Patrick and David ever demand a contract extension,'' Layden said. ''At no time have we discussed a contract extension.''</p>
        <p>In light of his remarks, however, Layden never gave a reason Ewing wanted to be traded from the perennially contending Knicks to the mediocre Sonics. But he did discuss backtracking from his statement in June, when he said that Ewing would not be traded.</p>
        <p>''That was our intention at the time,'' Layden said.</p>
