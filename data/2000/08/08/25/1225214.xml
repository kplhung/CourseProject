        <p>Ending weeks of conflict with the state, the New York City Board of Education agreed yesterday to place up to 400 certified teachers this fall in vacancies at some of the worst-performing elementary schools.</p>
        <p>The deal, reached after protracted negotiations between lawyers for the two sides, also gives the Board of Education a year to hire certified teachers to work in all of the city's 94 failing schools, including middle and high schools, which are mostly in poor communities. The agreement seems to compel the Board of Education to assign many newly hired certified teachers to the failing schools, even against their wishes.</p>
        <p>The agreement settles a lawsuit that Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, filed Aug. 1, demanding that new teachers hired to work in the city's failing schools be certified. As part of the deal, Mr. Mills essentially agreed to phase in those teachers at the low-performing schools by September 2001.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy had resisted Mr. Mills's demands, saying that there were not enough certified teachers available, and that requiring them to teach in troubled schools would discourage candidates from applying for jobs in New York City. Mr. Levy, reached by phone on his vacation in Maine, said that despite the settlement he remained concerned about attracting teachers when the city and the nation are facing a shortage of qualified teacher candidates.</p>
        <p>He expressed satisfaction that the dispute was over.</p>
        <p>''The compromise gives the board enough time to put plans in a place to find more certified teachers willing to teach in these difficult schools,'' he said, ''and also recognizes that there are shortage areas where no certified teachers are currently to be found.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills said he was pleased with the outcome of the hard-fought negotiations, which stretched over four days.</p>
        <p>''It recognizes that the children in the lowest-performing schools can and will get certified teachers, and I think it represents a fundamental change in the way the city recruits and assigns teachers,'' Mr. Mills said in a telephone interview. ''Until now, the city has recruited many certified teachers, but they don't go to the low-performing schools. The court order says that with the opening of school, the teachers in the elementary grades must be certified.''</p>
        <p>The case was settled by a consent order before Justice Joseph F. Bruno in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, where Mr. Mills filed the suit seeking to force Mr. Levy to replace uncertified teachers at the schools.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy is facing a unique challenge that he helped create. Before he became chancellor, he was a member of the State Board of Regents, which imposed new standards requiring all teachers in the state's public schools be certified. The ban on uncertified teachers will apply to all schools in 2003, posing a huge challenge for New York City. About 14 percent of its total teaching force of 77,000, or 11,000, are uncertified.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills said he became angry because last year New York City violated a new state policy requiring that after September 1999, only certified teachers be hired in the worst-performing schools. Last year, the city hired about 600 uncertified teachers to work in those schools because it could not find enough qualified teachers. Mr. Mills had repeatedly asked for assurances from Mr. Levy that he would reassign uncertified teachers this year and would hire only certified teachers for those schools this fall. Mr. Mills said he went to court because Mr. Levy had not promised to do so.</p>
        <p>In addition to requiring that certified teachers be hired for failing elementary schools this year, the settlement, which will be monitored by the court and the state, requires that any newly certified teachers fill vacancies at failing middle and high schools.</p>
        <p>The agreement also allows teachers to fill vacancies outside of the subject of their certification. For example, a teacher certified in English who minored in social studies can be a social studies teacher if that is where the need is, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills also agreed to use his discretion to determine whether uncertified teachers could remain at failing schools this year at their principals' request while obtaining their licenses. He is reviewing about 223 such applications now.</p>
        <p>As of June, about 960 of the 4,813 teachers working in the city's failing schools were uncertified, said Marie DeCanio, deputy executive of the division of human resources at the Board of Education. The board has hired 536 certified teachers to work in these schools and 1,000 to work in other public schools. An overall total of 3,000 teachers have been hired.</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, seemed relieved as she left the courthouse after the settlement was reached. She said the decision was best hashed out between the union, the city and the state.</p>
        <p>''We were against forced transfers and against assigning teachers against their will,'' she said. ''The judge played a tremendous role. He did not want to make a decision.''</p>
