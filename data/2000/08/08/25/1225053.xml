        <p>One of the more quietly exhilarating of current exhibitions is at the Jewish Museum. Its title is ''Drink and Be Merry: Wine and Beer in Ancient Times,'' and its lessons are nimbly presented in terms of a huge variety of objects drawn primarily from Israel but also from many other parts of the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Organized by the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, and first shown there, the exhibition has been augmented in New York by loans from (among others) the Metropolitan Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Pierpont Morgan Library and the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Private collectors from New York have also lent some important pieces.</p>
        <p>It is a scholarly show, big on dates and attentive to ancient ways and ancient authors from all over. We come away mindful of what Theophrastus (372-287 B.C.) had to say about plants. We grieve to know that the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79 put an end to the production of a widely celebrated local wine. (Cupids in the role of wine merchants appear in a wall painting from the first century A.D. in a house in Pompeii).</p>
        <p>Fledgling savants, we get to know that in the second half of the sixth millennium B.C wine was already produced in a Neolithic village in the northern Zagros Mountains of Iran.</p>
        <p>We also learn that on top of the redoubtable fortress of Masada, in Israel, King Herod the Great of Judea (no one's favorite character) lived very high indeed and had the finest Italian wines shipped from their place of production. We know that Roman taste favored sweet wines. We even know when the cork stopper (made from the bark of the cork oak) was invented.</p>
        <p>We know of two really peculiar episodes in the history of wine. I for one never knew that during the Punic Wars, Hannibal and his African troops bathed their horses in wine in Campania, south of Rome, and uprooted the local vineyards. Nor did I know that Rehoboam, now the word for a bottle the size of six ordinary bottles, was the name of the king of Egypt who was a son of Solomon and a mighty collector of wine.</p>
        <p>We also learn about wine as a disinfectant, wine as a painkiller, wine as a source of medicinal ointments and wine as a vital ingredient in the relief of asthma, epilepsy and kidney stones.</p>
        <p>Wine as something to enjoy is not neglected either. Its role in festivities is spelled out over the centuries. (It would appear that the number of guests at dinner could be anywhere from 70,000 to just 2). Without wine, the Greek symposium, as rendered sublimely by Plato, would have been unthinkable. (Both the playwright Euripides and the brother of the poet Sappho are said to have served wine at symposiums in their first youth).</p>
        <p>We glimpse, also, the role of wine in the worship of Dionysus, in which many a participant went distinctly and irretrievably over the top.</p>
        <p>The exhibition allows us almost to dream of taking part in those celebrated revels. There are low sofas on which we are free to sit, though not to recline, let alone to exchange the unbridled embraces that characterized many a symposium in ancient Greece. We can also see, close at hand, many an elegant reminder of those particular scenes.</p>
        <p>Among them are pieces of pottery on which men are portrayed carrying well-filled wineskins and others in which women far gone in undress are entertained by a beautiful musician of their own sex while sipping wine.</p>
        <p>There is a drinking scene on the reverse side of a Greek bowl (circa 490 B.C.) on which fine-looking young men strut their way around and show off their charms.</p>
        <p>There is Dionysus himself, not untouched by the ages, but still recognizably someone who could hold his own in a drinking contest with Hercules. There is also an arresting mask of Silenus (Roman period, first century A.D.). This particular Silenus is unmistakably the bearded ancient, much the worse for drink, and wreathed in this case with ivy leaves and grape clusters, who would follow Dionysus around.</p>
        <p>What we also see at the Jewish Museum is that the incidental elements in the cult of wine were marvelously elegant. This is true of the curved drinking horns, or rhytons, which opened out fully at the top and were closed at the bottom by a sculptured figure -- a lynx, for instance, or a ram. We can well believe that Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great, chose to be buried with silver objects of this quality.</p>
        <p>Wonderfully droll, likewise, is the Greek bronze vessel in the shape of a wineskin that seems to double as a human figure when it sits on the ground with arms outstretched. In this piece, form and function are one.</p>
        <p>Between wine and beer, in this show, there is no contest. The catalog leads off loyally by saying, ''Beer, an alcoholic beverage produced mainly from barley and wheat, is one of the oldest and most popular beverages known to mankind.''</p>
        <p>It is also true that in Egypt and Mesopotamia, in the fourth millennium B.C., beer made its appearance. But Egypt and Mesopotamia had cereals the way Israel and some of its neighbors had vines. And the Egyptians put their cereals to good use. In the fourth century A.D. a famous Egyptian chemist wrote a treatise on the making of beer. Besides, beer could hold its own with the bread, the geese and the oxen that hard-working Egyptians ate.</p>
        <p>But broadly speaking, those who could get wine did not get beer. In Mesopotamia, where grapes did not flourish, beermaking was thought to be under divine protection. (The Israel Museum even has a plaque of a Mesopotamian couple drinking beer while having sexual intercourse.)</p>
        <p>But there is something heavy-going and ineloquent about the ceremonies of brewing, serving and drinking beer, and it needs a small boat on the Nile to make it fun. Even so, this exhibition will send many visitors away with a ravaging thirst.</p>
        <p>''Drink and Be Merry: Wine and Beer in Ancient Times'' is at the Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, to Nov. 5.</p>
