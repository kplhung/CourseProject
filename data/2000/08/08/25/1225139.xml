        <p>Trainers take jockeys off horses all the time. What is rare is a big-name trainer and a successful jockey snapping at each other in the days leading up to a big race.</p>
        <p>But that has turned out to be one of the subplots for Saturday's $1 million Grade I Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course. The verbal combatants: the trainer Nick Zito and the rider Richard Migliore. At issue: Migliore's ride in the Grade II Jim Dandy Stakes here on Aug. 5.</p>
        <p>Before that race, Migliore had ridden Albert the Great to four consecutive front-running victories, including the Grade II Dwyer Stakes at Belmont Park in a field that included the Preakness winner, Red Bullet, and the Belmont Stakes winner, Commendable. In the Jim Dandy, however, Albert the Great finished last in the field of seven, beaten by 28 1/2 lengths.</p>
        <p>Zito decided to replace Migliore with Jorge Chavez for the Travers. Implicit in the move was some blame for the Jim Dandy fiasco, blame that became explicit for the first time this week when Zito partly faulted Migliore's riding tactics for Albert the Great's awful showing.</p>
        <p>To be fair, Zito also faulted Albert the Great's training regimen, which was disturbed by the inclement weather that has marred the Saratoga meet. Still, it was clear that Zito was upset with Migliore.</p>
        <p>''I say publicly that Richard didn't do anything terribly wrong,'' Zito said Monday as he sat outside his barn. ''But those fractions,'' he said, referring to Albert the Great's half-mile in 46 seconds and his three-quarters of a mile in 1:103 5 , ''were very fast. I wish he would have given him more of a break.''</p>
        <p>Migliore defended his ride. ''I can ride one bad and get them beat by three lengths,'' Migliore said. ''But I can't ride one bad enough to get him beat by 27 lengths.''</p>
        <p>Having been replaced by Zito, Migliore picked up a Travers assignment on Impeachment, the only horse to compete in each of the Triple Crown races this year. Impeachment is trained by Todd Pletcher, who was tied for the lead in the trainer standing for the meet with 11 victories.</p>
        <p>''The biggest thing on our side is that I have a tremendous amount of respect for our trainer,'' Migliore said. ''I believe in Todd Pletcher.''</p>
        <p>Does that mean that Migliore neither trusts nor believes in Zito? ''He just took me off,'' Migliore said. ''And that's his prerogative. People look at those kinds of things and say, 'That's unfair.' But I don't take it personally.''</p>
        <p>Migliore just wants to take it out on Zito's horse on Saturday afternoon. As for Zito, he is just trying to sneak Albert the Great, who will race without blinkers Saturday, back into contention for the 3-year-old title.</p>
        <p>''I think that if we can win the Travers, we have a chance to get in,''  Zito said. Hence the switch to Chavez, who is second in the jockey standing to Jerry Bailey.</p>
        <p>Referring to the Jim Dandy, Zito said, ''My job is to try to erase that race. We'll start with a new jockey and a clean slate.''</p>
