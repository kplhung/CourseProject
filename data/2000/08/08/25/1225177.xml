        <p>A gap between test scores of black and white students that had narrowed through the 1980's widened from 1990 to 1999, according to results released yesterday by the federal Department of Education, with the average black 17-year-old reading only about as well as the average white 13-year-old.</p>

        <p>A gap between test scores of black and white students that had narrowed through the 1980's widened from 1990 to 1999, according to results released yesterday by the federal Department of Education, with the average black 17-year-old reading only about as well as the average white 13-year-old.</p>
        <p>Most perplexing, officials said, is that the gap is widest among children of the best-educated parents, where average scores by white students remained relatively steady while those of blacks fell back toward the lower achievement of the late 1970's.</p>
        <p>That data suggest that what was once considered an urban problem, the consequence of poverty and disadvantage, has become a suburban problem, too, one that may result from lower expectations by teachers, a lower number of black students taking tougher courses, or different attitudes about education among black students.</p>
        <p>Such disparity in test performance, which has also been seen from analysis of SAT scores, has become one of the most challenging issues in American education. Evidence of a similar pattern in these tests, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, is more indicative of the situation in American schools because it includes students from all groups, not merely those who are seeking to go to college.</p>
        <p>Educators and officials say there is no clear explanation for why progress slipped after the gains of the 1980's in the next decade of remarkable prosperity.</p>
        <p>''This is a depressing reversal of the gains made over the past two decades,'' said Michael T. Nettles, vice chairman of the National Assessment Governing Board, which monitors results of the test, ''The alarming part is that since 1992, the gaps have been getting wider.''</p>
        <p>While there are still gaps between white and Hispanic students, those continued to narrow over the past few years, the test results show.</p>
        <p>And while blacks are catching up to whites in performance of the basic skills, showing an ability to do simple arithmetic, for example, they are slipping further behind whites when asked to do more complicated work,  like fractions, percentages or decimals. This, officials said yesterday, suggests that efforts by states like Texas to make sure more students know the basics before they graduate from high school have paid off. The challenge now, they say, is for states to demand even higher levels of achievement.</p>
        <p>The tests are given every few years, in different intervals, depending on subject, to samplings of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds. While other versions of the national tests have changed to reflect changing curriculums, this test, known as the long-term trend test, has stayed essentially the same over the 30 years it has been administered to about 16,000 students around the country. It is considered the most reliable survey of American students' performance.</p>
        <p>The overall results revealed some positive signs. Girls, in particular, have made striking gains in math and science, and math scores over all have improved consistently from the 1970's through 1999. But reading scores remained flat or dropped. And science scores of 17-year-olds were lower in 1999 than they were when the test was first given in 1969.</p>
        <p>Education Secretary Richard W. Riley and other officials emphasized yesterday that blacks had made progress since the tests were first given. In almost every subject at every age level, the average scores of blacks were higher than they were in the late 1960's or early 1970's.</p>
        <p>The trouble, they said, is a new pattern of slipping. Among 9-year-olds in science, for example, the gap in scores between blacks and whites narrowed to 41 points in 1999 from 57 points in 1970. But that 41 points is up from 37 points in 1996. Among nine indicators -- three age groups in  three subjects -- the gap has widened in seven since 1996.</p>
        <p>In some cases, it has slipped back to where it was in the early 1970's. Among 17-year-olds, for instance, the gap in science scores widened to 52 points in 1999 from 47 points in 1996, almost back to the 54-point difference noted in 1969.</p>
        <p>The gap has grown most strikingly in ranks of children of the better-educated. In reading scores of 17-year-olds in 1971, there was a 44-point difference between whites and blacks whose parents had gone beyond high school. That narrowed to 27 points in 1990, but then grew again to 36 points in 1999.</p>
        <p>Researchers said yesterday that  the gap was not a reflection of intelligence.</p>
        <p>''What I can say with total confidence is this is not an I.Q. story,'' said Abigal Thernstrom, author, with her husband, Stephan, of ''America in Black and White'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1997) as well as a forthcoming book on the test gap. ''Black I.Q. scores haven't gone down, and we are seeing too many success stories. This is a story about schooling. You look at places that really are doing a great job with highly disadvantaged urban kids -- and they exist all over this country -- and you know it can be done.''</p>
        <p>Michael D. Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, said that cities where the gap had narrowed significantly, like  Houston and Philadelphia, offer preschool to all children, successful after-school programs and smaller classes.</p>
