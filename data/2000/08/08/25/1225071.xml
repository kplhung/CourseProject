        <p>The moment the star-crossed title characters in Paul Morrison's somber love story ''Solomon and Gaenor'' set eyes on each other, your heart sinks. It is immediately obvious there is nowhere for these young lovers to travel but down an awfully familiar path from clandestine ecstasy to pariahhood to tragedy that could take any of three final twists, all equally predictable. Surrendering yourself to this well-acted film is never a question of wondering when the last shoe will drop, but one of how much you'll allow yourself to identify with its likable but foolish lovers, who break the strict social rules of their claustrophobically dingy community and pay the usual price.</p>
        <p>That community is an impoverished Welsh coal mining village in 1911. Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd) is the eldest son in a devout Orthodox Jewish family that has recently migrated to Wales from Russia and has set up a pawnshop that doubles as a drapery business. One of Solomon's tasks is to go from door to door of the miners' cottages across the hill, peddling swatches of cloth that can be made into dresses.

        <p>The moment the star-crossed title characters in Paul Morrison's somber love story ''Solomon and Gaenor'' set eyes on each other, your heart sinks. It is immediately obvious there is nowhere for these young lovers to travel but down an awfully familiar path from clandestine ecstasy to pariahhood to tragedy that could take any of three final twists, all equally predictable. Surrendering yourself to this well-acted film is never a question of wondering when the last shoe will drop, but one of how much you'll allow yourself to identify with its likable but foolish lovers, who break the strict social rules of their claustrophobically dingy community and pay the usual price.</p>
        <p>That community is an impoverished Welsh coal mining village in 1911. Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd) is the eldest son in a devout Orthodox Jewish family that has recently migrated to Wales from Russia and has set up a pawnshop that doubles as a drapery business. One of Solomon's tasks is to go from door to door of the miners' cottages across the hill, peddling swatches of cloth that can be made into dresses. One day he stops at the door of Gaenor's strict, churchgoing family. She answers his knock, and a spark is lighted.</p>
        <p>To the film's considerable credit, the young lovers don't exactly conform to the Romeo and Juliet stereotype of celestial innocents crushed by a cruel and envious world. Solomon, the more morally culpable of the two, is a flagrant liar whose courtship of Gaenor involves adopting a non-Jewish pseudonym, Sam Livingstone, and making up a nonexistent Gentile family. As enraptured as Solomon appears to be during the first throes of their passionate affair, he never broaches the subject of marriage, which for a time she assumes is his intention.</p>
        <p>For her part, Gaenor (Nia Roberts) proves easily seduced. Once Solomon has given her a pretty red dress he has sewn himself, she is a goner. She hurls herself into a sexual relationship with Solomon while hardly knowing him. Neither one seems to have the slightest awareness of the possibility that she might become pregnant. Which she does, of course, discovering the pregnancy just around the time she has given up hope of Solomon's proposing marriage or even of meeting his family.</p>
        <p>Although its storytelling includes a number of small glitches, the movie does an almost dismayingly good job of conveying its characters' grim, bare-bones existence and the stultifying sexual and religious taboos that the lovers flout. And without dwelling on anti-Semitism, it evokes the tensions between Jews and Gentiles, which explode into vandalism, arson and looting after a strike imperils the miners' precarious existence and they take out their resentment on the local Jewish merchants.</p>
        <p>The most emotionally harrowing scenes show the pregnant Gaenor's brutal denunciation and expulsion from church when her pregnancy is revealed during a service, and Solomon's rapidly crumbling relationship with Gaenor's loutish older brother, Crad (Mark Lewis Jones), who is suspicious of the young stranger from the start because of his uncallused hands.</p>
        <p>The movie has a good performance by Mr. Gruffudd, whose Solomon becomes obsessed with Gaenor only after she has rejected him. But it is Ms. Roberts (making her debut) who walks off with the film. Her understated, beautifully layered performance suggests the spark of defiance under Gaenor's prim exterior and fans it into a reckless impul siveness that eventually deepens into an enfolding womanly passion containing just a touch of fanaticism.</p>
        <p>''Solomon and Gaenor'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nudity and sexual situations.</p>
