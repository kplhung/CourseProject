        <p>No Lasting Problems Seen For Mitsubishi in Japan  Despite the public humiliation that it had concealed customer complaints about defects for more than two decades, Mitsubishi Motors, Japan's fourth-largest carmaker, is not likely to suffer a significant loss in sales or damage to its brand image in Japan, analysts say.</p>
        <p>For one, analysts said, both Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru, and Daihatu Motors were forced to recall cars in the late 1990's, with little effect on sales. And despite the deception in Mitsubishi's case, there was no evidence that the defects had caused any fatal or otherwise serious accidents, further limiting potential public reaction to the recall of 620,000 cars and trucks.

        <p>Medical 'Buyers' Clubs' Crop Up  Some new companies are beginning to offer below-market prices on prescription drugs and services like doctor, dental and eye care and medical tests. Like buyers' discount clubs such as Costco, the companies attract people looking for a better price. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Nintendo Announces New Console  Nintendo offered the opening gambit in what is certain to become a bitter battle of new technology and cost-cutting in the home video game industry. It announced both a new home console based on an I.B.M. PowerPC chip and a new version of its handheld Gameboy system. Neither system is scheduled to arrive in the United States market before next year. The American depository receipts of Nintendo fell 25 cents, to $21.75. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Stocks Up on Good Corporate News  Stocks rose as Wall Street cheered upbeat corporate news and signs that interest rate increases may be coming to an end. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 38.09 points, to 11,182.74, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index edged up 2.34 points, to 1,508.31. The Nasdaq composite index gained 42.27 points, or 1.05 percent, to 4,053.28. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Ex-Fund Manager Charged in Fraud  Michael W. Berger, who managed the Manhattan Investment Fund, was charged with defrauding 300 people who invested about $575 million while losing about $400 million. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Ford Rejects Broader Tire Recall  Ford Motor officials lashed out at plaintiffs' lawyers suing the automaker and Bridgestone/Firestone, accusing them of endangering public safety by calling for a broader recall of tires and of distributing Ford documents out of context to journalists. ''A broader recall is wrong,'' said Helen Petrauskas, a Ford executive. ''It's wrong because many good tires will be delivered and used to replace good tires -- and people who have tires which should be replaced will have to stand in line and wait.'' [C6.]</p>
        <p>No Rush Seen on Fuel Economy  A government report to be released as early as today reaches few conclusions about the effects of tightening federal fuel-economy regulations for cars, making it virtually certain that the rules will not be changed by Congress before the end of this year.
