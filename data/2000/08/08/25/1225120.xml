        <p>The two nuclear reactors in the sunken Russian submarine Kursk should pose no immediate risk to the surrounding environment and only a moderate risk in the coming decades, naval experts and environmentalists say.</p>
        <p>''This is not high on the list to worry about,'' said Thomas B. Cochran, director of the nuclear program for the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>Measurements indicate no radiation leaks from the submarine at present, the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority said on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the radioactive elements within the Kursk remain of concern, because the submarine lies in relatively shallow water -- 350 feet down -- in a rich fishing area. Should radiation leaks occur, currents could spread the radioactivity over a large portion of the Barents Sea.</p>
        <p>The environmental group Greenpeace urged on Tuesday that the Kursk be pulled off the ocean bottom if possible. ''It's not a matter of if radiation will be released from the Kursk,'' said William Peden of Greenpeace. ''It's a matter of when. We hope the international community will spare no effort, spare no expense in making the Kursk safe.''</p>
        <p>With apparently no immediate radiation danger, there is time to first survey the Kursk before deciding what to do, said Thomas Nilsen, a researcher with the Norwegian environmental group Bellona. ''We could actually make things worse than it already is by shaking the submarine,'' he said. ''We say we are in a hurry, but we should not rush.''</p>
        <p>If the Kursk is so badly damaged that it might break apart during a salvage effort, other options should be considered, such as cutting out the reactor compartment or entombing the submarine, Mr. Peden said.</p>
        <p>Including the Kursk, seven nuclear-powered submarines -- two American, five Russian -- have sunk. So far, none appears to have leaked nuclear fuel into the surrounding water. Submarine reactors are sealed within thick steel walls, and most experts believe decades or longer will pass before seawater corrodes through the walls.</p>
        <p>The United States Navy has sent remote-controlled underwater vehicles to the wreckage of the submarine Thresher, which went down in 1963 off Cape Cod, and the Scorpion, which sank in 1968 off the Azores, about six times each, collecting samples of sediment, water and plant or animal life around the wrecks.</p>
        <p>''We've done surveys at those sites and have seen very, very little radioactivity coming out from the ships,'' said Jonathan Kiell, a spokesman for the Navy.</p>
        <p>The sediment within a few feet of the submarines contain slightly raised levels of radioactivity, believed to come from the reactor's coolant, and not the fuel. The coolant becomes slightly radioactive through the normal operation of a nuclear reactor.</p>
        <p>''All of our surveys have shown there is no environmental threat created from those two submarines,'' Mr. Kiell said.</p>
        <p>Norwegian monitoring of the Russian submarine Komsomolets, which sank in waters a mile deep in the North Atlantic, 300 miles off the coast of Norway, also shows slight radiation leaks from the cooling fluid, not the reactor core.</p>
        <p>Many of the dangerous radioactive elements in spent nuclear fuel decay away within weeks and months. The two of most concern -- strontium-90 and cesium-137 -- have half-lives of about 30 years, and will take about 300 years to decay away.</p>
        <p>Aleksandr Nikitin, an environmental activist who was once an engineer on a Russian nuclear submarine, has been the most alarmist, saying that the Kursk will start leaking radiation within weeks.</p>
        <p>''To my mind, I'm sure about it, that in a month or two months, the submarine will no longer be hermetically sealed,'' Mr. Nikitin said in an interview through a translator.</p>
        <p>But even Mr. Nikitin said the radiation would come from the cooling water, not the reactor fuel.</p>
        <p>''This is not going to be a major hazard,'' said Mr. Cochran of the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
