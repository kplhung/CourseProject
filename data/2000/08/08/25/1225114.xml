        <p>The Clinton administration issued guidelines this week that would at long last allow federal funding of research on stem cells derived from human embryos. This avenue of inquiry offers the potential for breathtaking medical breakthroughs. Even so, the guidelines are sure to be challenged by pro-life members of Congress who have vowed to block the needed funding.</p>
        <p>The research involves taking cells from a human embryo when it is only a week old and still just a microscopic clump of cells. The expectation is that scientists will learn to manipulate these versatile cells to produce the specialized tissue needed to treat such diseases as diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, spinal cord injuries, burns, heart disease, cancer and other maladies.</p>
        <p>Yet progress has been stymied for years by Congressional opponents who consider the clumps of embryonic cells a form of life that must be protected. Although stem cell research is allowed in the private sector, Congress has banned federal funding.</p>
        <p>The new guidelines have been written with great care to answer many of the criticisms. The stem cells will be taken from frozen human embryos that would otherwise be discarded after treating infertile couples. The cells will be obtained by private companies rather than by the researchers who receive government funds, in an effort to skirt Congressional prohibitions on funding research in which embryos are destroyed or discarded. And there will be multiple scientific and ethical reviews.</p>
        <p>Evidence has been emerging that in some circumstances adult stem cells might be used to achieve the same medical benefits, thus avoiding the need to use embryos. But no one yet knows which approach will work best with which diseases. It makes sense to give researchers the broadest possible arsenal to cope with some of the most devastating human diseases.</p>
