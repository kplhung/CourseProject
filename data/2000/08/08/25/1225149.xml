        <p>Mention the name Slade Gorton in this far corner of Indian Country, and some people will talk about Slade Gorton the senior senator from Washington who is securing $15 million this year to replace a decrepit tribal school.</p>
        <p>But most people will think of Slade Gorton the Indian fighter, the better-known and much-feared figure, a 72-year-old Republican who has spent much of his public life battling tribes like the Lummis, who live a two-hour drive north of Seattle, on things like  fishing rights and the extent of their powers on reservations.</p>

        <p>Mention the name Slade Gorton in this far corner of Indian Country, and some people will talk about Slade Gorton the senior senator from Washington who is securing $15 million this year to replace a decrepit tribal school.</p>
        <p>But most people will think of Slade Gorton the Indian fighter, the better-known and much-feared figure, a 72-year-old Republican who has spent much of his public life battling tribes like the Lummis, who live a two-hour drive north of Seattle, on things like  fishing rights and the extent of their powers on reservations.</p>
        <p>In all the years that Mr. Gorton has feuded with Indians, he has never been subjected to a strong political backlash from them. But this year, flush with money from casino operations, Indians across the country say they are going to make him pay.</p>
        <p>And because Mr. Gorton controls Indian-program purse strings in the Senate, the stakes are high, creating tension among tribal members who say they are afraid that their challenge to Mr. Gorton could threaten the paternal role of government that bonds most tribes, uneasily, to Washington, D.C. This year, however,  many tribal leaders say they are so upset at Mr. Gorton that they are  willing to take the risk.</p>
        <p>For the first time, Indians have pooled money and are mounting a campaign against a specific candidate, rather than for or against a single issue, as Indians have done in successful ballot initiatives on tribal-run gambling in California. The tribes say they have raised nearly $500,000 of what is planned to be a $2 million independent campaign to deny a fourth term to Mr. Gorton, who says his policies regarding Indians are driven by a belief that all Americans should be governed by the same laws.</p>
        <p>''From now on, members of Congress and senators should think twice before trying to undermine tribal authority,'' said Ron Allen, vice president of the National Congress of American Indians and the leader of the campaign to raise Indian money against Mr. Gorton.</p>
        <p>''That's how politics works,'' Mr. Allen said. ''And until now, we've never played the game.''</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Indians contributed a record $1.3 million in unregulated soft money, mostly to Democrats, but with no specific target. This year, the tribes are on pace to surpass the 1996 mark, and Mr. Gorton is the sole target, ''public enemy No. 1,'' as the Native American Rights Fund, the largest Indian legal support group in the nation, has labeled him.</p>
        <p>At a rally of the national Indian congress several months ago, leaders urged tribes to contribute to the First American Education Project, the fund set up to run issue advertisements against Mr. Gorton.</p>
        <p>The television and radio advertisements started running this month, featuring a telegenic tribal leader talking to children about the environment and then segueing to images of a large proposed mine in north-central Washington, which Indians oppose and Mr. Gorton backs.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gorton, who has fared poorly in recent polls even though Democrats will not select their nominee for nearly a month, is using the campaign against him to generate money of his own, citing ''Indian tribes flush with gambling dollars'' in a fund-raising letter to supporters. And he has used his position as chairman of the Senate subcommittee that controls federal funding for the tribes to counter the impression that he is anti-Indian.</p>
        <p>Here on the Lummi Reservation, for example, the tribe is desperate to replace its cluster of dilapidated modular buildings where children from kindergarten to high school are educated. Mr. Gorton has helped to ensure money for a new school.</p>
        <p>But at the same time, the feud between the tribe and Mr. Gorton over Indian control of water and property of non-Indians living on the Lummi reservation has escalated. A few years ago, the senator threatened to withhold half of the tribe's federal financing if it did not accommodate outside developers seeking more water for building homes for non-Indians on privately owned or leased land within the reservation. The dispute continues, causing a deep rift among the tribe as it tries to win federal money for the new school.</p>
        <p>''For the Lummi people, this has become personal,'' said Darrell Hillaire, a member of the Lummi tribal council. ''The needs of our children come first, and Senator Gorton has helped us there, and we respect him for that. But on all these other issues, it seems like it's racial with him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorton says his positions have nothing to do with race.</p>
        <p>Willie Jones, the Lummi tribal chairman, said the tribe was not sure how active it would be in the campaign to defeat Mr. Gorton because the school money comes first.</p>
        <p>''We have to stand up for our children,'' Mr. Jones said. ''But we also have to make a stand for our rights. The Indian tribes are finally learning how to use the system, and this is the test case.''</p>
        <p>Others fear a backlash.</p>
        <p>''Tribes pooling their resources together in an effort to defeat a senator is a recipe for disaster,'' said Tom Keefe, a Democrat running for the House in eastern Washington, who is married to a Nez Perce Indian. ''What if the tribes pour millions of dollars into the campaign and Senator Gorton wins re-election?''</p>
        <p>Washington, with 29 federally recognized tribes, most of them based near urban areas around Puget Sound, has long been at the center of modern-day disputes between Indians and non-Indians. Mr. Gorton's battles with the tribes date to the mid-1970s, when, as Washington's attorney general, he opposed the treaty rights of Indians to take up to half annual runs of salmon and steelhead trout. He carried the fight to the Supreme Court and lost.</p>
        <p>As a senator, he proposed a bill to curtail Indian fishing rights. Five years ago, he tried to cut nearly 25 percent of Bureau of Indian Affairs dollars, which go directly to tribal governments. And two years ago, he introduced measures that tried to knock out tribal immunity from certain civil lawsuits. In support of the repeal of tribal immunity, Mr. Gorton held a hearing in the Seattle area,  which drew hundreds of people carrying anti-Indian slogans and waving American flags.</p>
        <p>All of the proposals failed in the Senate and were fiercely opposed by Republicans, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, who received more political donations from Indians than any presidential candidate ever had.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorton says non-Indians do not have adequate constitutional protections on reservations. He supports Indian self-government, but says tribal rule should not extend to non-Indians. This year, he points to his effort to increase Interior Department spending on tribal schools by $143 million as an example of his support for basic Indian needs.</p>
        <p>''When I drafted the Interior bill this year, one of my top priorities was to dramatically increase federal dollars for tribal schools,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But many Indians say Mr. Gorton's support of schools is designed to divert attention from a quarter-century of public battles with the tribes.</p>
        <p>''It's election year window-dressing,'' said Brian Cladoosby, chairman of the Association of Washington Tribes, and head of Swinomish Indian Tribal Council, based just south of here. ''People remember what he has done over the years. This year, we are trying to make him an example. And so, even if we don't defeat him, it will send a message --  we can no longer be ignored.''</p>
        <p>For the last two months, Mr. Allen, who is chairman of the Jamestown S'Klallam tribe on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, has been visiting some of the wealthier tribes around the country, trying to raise money to fight Mr. Gorton. Indian-run gambling is generating more than $8 billion a year in revenue.</p>
        <p>The wealthiest of the casino-enriched tribes, the Mashantucket Pequots of Connecticut, may donate to the fund, even though some of the tribal leaders are Republican, as is Mr. Allen.</p>
        <p>''There have been substantial and continuous attacks on Indian Country from Mr. Gorton,'' said John Guevremont, the director of national affairs for the Mashantucket Pequots, who said he was a Republican. ''The tribes have a long list of grievances against him and now have the means to try to defeat him.''</p>
