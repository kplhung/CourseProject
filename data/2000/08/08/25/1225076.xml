        <p>Carlos Diegues's ''Orfeu'' is based on the play by the Brazilian writer Vinicius de Moraes that also inspired Marcel Camus's 1959 film, ''Black Orpheus.'' Mr. Diegues is one of his country's leading directors. (His earlier films include ''Xica,'' ''Bye-Bye Brazil'' and ''Subway to the Stars.'') He has not so much remade ''Black Orpheus'' as tried to correct it and to bring the mythic resonances of the original play into line with the complicated realities of contemporary Brazil.</p>
        <p>The basic story -- a retelling of the legend of the bard Orpheus and his tragic love for the nymph Eurydice, played out against the jubilant frenzy of Rio's carnival -- is the same, as is the milieu, the serpentine slums, called favelas, that cling to the city's hills. (The Carioca Hill shantytown in ''Orfeu'' is a set, painstakingly decked out with graffiti and tattered bits of decoration). In Camus's movie, the favelas were a place of exuberant primitivism, a realm of pure folklore, whose characteristic musical expression, the samba, was the spontaneous expression of joy in the face of deprivation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diegues's Rio, in contrast, is, for all its vivid local color, the hub of a heterogeneous and sophisticated popular culture. And its misery consists not of picturesque squalor but of gun battles between vicious drug gangs and corrupt, murderous police officers. His heroes and villains live in a recognizably modern world. Orfeu, played by the Brazilian pop star Toni Garrido, is a serious musician, composing his sambas with the aid of a laptop and orchestrating his carnival performance with the discipline and self-assurance of a show business professional.</p>
        <p>A similar cosmopolitanism informs the movie itself, which turns Camus's romantic ethnology inside out, presenting a nation proudly aware of its cultural achievements and thus able to welcome and assimilate outside influences. Just as Orfeu leavens his sambas with hip-hop and funk -- nobody is scandalized except an obtuse policeman named Stallone -- ''Orfeu'' filters de Moraes's literary conceit through the lens of American urban cinema. An unseen radio disc jockey, the self-proclaimed ''Voice of the Hill,'' is the film's conscience and Greek chorus, a device that recalls Walter Hill's ''Warriors'' (also based on a classical source) and Spike Lee's ''Do the Right Thing.'' And in making the figure of Death a drug dealer who was Orfeu's childhood friend, Mr. Diegues manages both to augment his film's naturalism and to place ''Orfeu'' in a tradition that extends from the rap-fueled ghetto melodramas of recent years back through ''Mean Streets'' and, ultimately, the classic gangster movies of the 1930's.</p>
        <p>Such eclecticism is both the movie's most interesting feature and the source of its shortcomings. ''Orfeu'' tries to do too much at once: to be both mythic and realistic, to celebrate Rio's rich culture while exposing the brutality and cynicism that dominate daily life in its slums. In part because of its simplistic, sentimental depiction of favela life, ''Black Orpheus'' was a simpler, more coherent film than this one, which struggles to balance disparate styles and clashing emotional registers.</p>
        <p>The acting is especially uneven. Mr. Garrido, gorgeous and effortlessly charismatic, is convincing when called upon to be feckless and charming, but he strains when the burden of tragic emotion is dropped onto his shoulders. The thick-necked and glowering Murilo Benicio, as Lucinho, the drug lord who rules Carioca Hill, tries to convey the anguish simmering underneath his character's thuggery but ends up doing a faltering impression of Harvey Keitel. Except for the sloe-eyed Patricia Franca, whose Euridice is in any case a half-dreamed emanation of Orfeu's desire, the women -- Isabel Fillardis as Orfeu's jilted lover, Mira, and Maria Ceica as Euridice's embittered aunt, Carmen -- emote awkwardly, caught between the psychological expressivity of melodrama and the more stylized keenings of Greek tragedy.</p>
        <p>Only Milton Goncalves, as Orfeu's father, Inacio, who has given up music for religion, and Zeze Motta, as his hotheaded wife, Conceicao, succeed in making their characters real people as well as archetypes. But if the other actors flail a bit, the movie itself manages to keep its contradictory energies from exploding all over the place. This is partly because Caetano Veloso's score, which includes some songs written for the original play, supplies the missing emotional nuances. The best Brazilian music -- represented by both the carnival sambas and the delicate bossa nova ballads on the soundtrack -- somehow fuses pure sentiment with intellectual clarity, a fusion the film aspires to but never quite achieves.</p>
        <p>''Orfeu'' was photographed by Affonso Beato, whose sense of color so enriched Pedro Almodovar's ''All About My Mother,'' and it's similarly beautiful to look at without being overly showy. Somehow Rio, like Paris or New York, is one of those cities that looks great on film no matter how many times you've seen it before, and its silvery tropical light, especially when Orfeu calls up the sunrise with his guitar, has never looked better.</p>
        <p>In the end the music, the city and the ardor of Mr. Diegues's commitment to his story, with all its contradictions and confusions, lift ''Orfeu'' above its flaws. It may succeed neither in plumbing the depths of the contemporary Brazilian life nor in rising to heights of allegory, but it finds a sprawling, vivid middle ground somewhere between documentary and myth -- a place that might be the true Rio de Janeiro after all.</p>
