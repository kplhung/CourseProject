        <p>Sheer niceness is not a quality you expect to find in a rock concert film. But niceness is precisely the ambience of ''Bittersweet Motel,'' Todd Phillips's bland, unrevealing documentary of the hugely popular cult band Phish on tour in 1998.</p>
        <p>This rock quartet is one band for whom the standard equation of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll hardly applies. Instead of sex, think hugs and naked fans innocently romping outdoors. Instead of drugs, think soy milk strained through homemade oatmeal cookies. Or the Grateful Dead with the mystical psychedelic burners turned on low.</p>

        <p>Sheer niceness is not a quality you expect to find in a rock concert film. But niceness is precisely the ambience of ''Bittersweet Motel,'' Todd Phillips's bland, unrevealing documentary of the hugely popular cult band Phish on tour in 1998.</p>
        <p>This rock quartet is one band for whom the standard equation of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll hardly applies. Instead of sex, think hugs and naked fans innocently romping outdoors. Instead of drugs, think soy milk strained through homemade oatmeal cookies. Or the Grateful Dead with the mystical psychedelic burners turned on low.</p>
        <p>True, Phish's redheaded lead singer, Trey Anastasio, is shown drinking beer, and in one scene he might be a tiny bit tipsy. But guzzling beer is something even the squarest college Joes like to do on a Saturday night. Another scene observes some teenage parking attendants at a Phish concert discussing the chemistry of marijuana, but the members of  Phish itself aren't shown smoking or snorting anything.</p>
        <p>As for sex, one scene finds Mr. Anastasio amiably fending off an enthusiastic but inarticulate female fan who might possibly have designs on him. If she does, he seems not to notice. Instead of exuding any macho Dionysian charisma or sartorial flash in concert, Phish prefers to convey the bonhomie of superannuated collegiate nerds. (The band members are all in their mid-30's.)</p>
        <p>Of the four, Mr. Anastasio has by far the most screen time. He muses affably about a bad review that accused Phish of artistically ''urinating on the audience'' and expresses pride that over the years, the members have remained friends. Born in New Jersey, he describes himself as a child of the 70's in his eclectic musical tastes. The quartet's other  members -- its keyboardist, Page McConnell; its bassist, Mike Gordon; and its drummer, Jon Fishman -- remain politely in the background.</p>
        <p>Phish's very first gig, at an R.O.T.C. dance, Mr. Anastasio recalls, was not a success, and the students tried to drown out the band's version of ''Proud Mary'' by turning up the volume on Michael Jackson's ''Thriller.'' But Phish improved and developed an ever widening fan base, largely through word of mouth and more recently through the Internet. The group eventually became America's most popular band to sustain a following while  remaining largely under the radar of the mass media. Phish's albums have sold in the millions without the benefit of hit singles or MTV promotional buzz. Like the Dead, to whom  Phish is inevitably compared, the group is known for marathon concerts that are never the same and draws the same kind of nomadic hordes who follow the band from gig  to gig.</p>
        <p>''Bittersweet Motel'' includes quite a bit of music, but not nearly enough to show the band's range of musical interests or its ability to create wonderful free-floating jams. Its essential style is an upbeat, improvisatory folk-rock, reminiscent of the Dead's, that often rides on a cheerfully chugging beat. Like the Dead, Phish lacks a polished lead singer, and the group's homegrown vocal harmonies are frequently out of tune. But that's part of its folksy charm.</p>
        <p>The most dramatic event in the movie, which opens today at Cinema Village, is an outdoor concert near a small town in Maine at which the fans were invited to take off their clothes and lie down in a circle. Glimpsed from afar, the spectacle of 1,200 naked bodies scrunched together resembles nothing so much as a huge stack of freshly caught fish baking in the sun. Or is that baked Phish?</p>
        <p>BITTERSWEET MOTEL</p>
        <p>Produced and directed by Todd Phillips; director of photography, Elia Lyssy; edited by Alan Oxman; music by Phish; released by Stranger Than Fiction Films. At Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 80 minutes. This film is not rated.</p>
        <p>WITH: Phish: Page McConnell, Trey Anastasio, Jon Fishman and Mike Gordon.</p>
