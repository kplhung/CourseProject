        <p>DANIEL-David, 58, died on August 13th in Tampa, Fla. He leaves a sister, Charliss Jennings. David wrote brilliantly on dance &amp; music for Vogue, Vanity Fair, The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, Stage Bill, and many other publications. We valued his extraordinarily subtle understanding of the art of performance, his complex yet intuitive grasp of musical and theatrical traditions, and his inimitable instinct for the gifts that make an artist a star. David's glittering analysis of dance and music as moment-to-moment experience in New York made him a unique, unforgettable, now muchmissed friend. Joan Acocella, Mindy Aloff, Peter Anastos, Aimee Bell, Joy Williams Brown, Van Cliburn, Arlene Croce, Prudence Crowther, Sharon DeLano, Erich Eichman, Charles France, Robert Gottlieb, Jonnie Greene, Robert Greskovic, Eduardus Halim, Laura Jacobs, Julie Kavanagh, Allegra Kent, Rebecca &amp; Eugene Long, Ross MacGibbon, Delia Marshall, Christopher O'Riley, Jed Perl, Deborah Rosenthal, Robert Tracy, James Wolcott.</p>
