        <p>Intel is forming an industry working group to foster standards and protocols for so-called peer-to-peer computing, particularly in business environments. Popularized by music distribution services like Napster and Gnutella, peer-to-peer computing is a set of technologies that enable the direct exchange of services or data between computers. ''Peer-to-peer computing could be as important to the Internet's future as the Web browser was to its past,'' said Patrick Gelsinger, vice president and chief technology officer of the Intel Architecture Group. By using the collective processing power of the thousands of PC's at Intel in a peer-to-peer network, the company was able to mothball its mainframe computers, saving $500 million, he said.</p>
