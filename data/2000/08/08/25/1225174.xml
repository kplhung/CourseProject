        <p>The cancellation of a Republican Party television advertisement attacking Al Gore's trustworthiness has exposed tensions within the Bush campaign over whether to go negative against the vice president now.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said this morning that he had stepped in to block the advertisement. But despite his insistence that voters abhor negative advertising and yearn for an elevated discourse, some of his advisers had argued that the party should run the advertisement, officials close to the discussions said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's objections aside, the officials said that his campaign was still poised to run other commercials that raise questions about Mr. Gore's truthfulness and ethics.</p>
        <p>''There's plenty to let loose on,'' said one Bush adviser. ''We can have a pretty effective fusillade. All the research has been done. It's all there.''</p>
        <p>The commercial, which the Republican Party pulled on Wednesday after Mr. Bush intervened, used excerpts from a six-year-old interview in which a stammering Mr. Gore said President Clinton had never lied in his political career.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush told reporters today that he objected to the advertisement, which was financed by the Republican National Committee.</p>
        <p>''I think it's appropriate to challenge the man's credibility,'' Mr. Bush said, referring to Mr. Gore. ''I don't think it's appropriate to challenge the man's credibility in that context.''</p>
        <p>Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, acknowledged that some Bush advisers wanted to run the commercial. ''There were some people who felt the ad was fine,'' she said. ''Some people felt the ad was not fine.''</p>
        <p>Some Bush advisers were so determined that the campaign play hardball against Mr. Gore that they urged that the commercial be used even after concerns were raised about its fairness, according to people close to the discussions. The night before the advertisement was pulled, Matthew Dowd, a Bush campaign official, attended a focus group at which the Republicans sought reaction to an assortment of possible advertisements, including the one that was shelved.</p>
        <p>The discussions in the Bush campaign and at the Republican Party over the advertisement reflect a continuing debate among Bush advisers over strategy toward the Gore campaign. They take on an urgency as polls show the race is tightening -- and each side is struggling to gain an upper hand.</p>
        <p>This is no small matter given that the bulk of the tens of millions of dollars that the campaigns will spend to frame the political discourse will be for 30-second commercials.</p>
        <p>Bush campaign officials and outside advisers said the campaign had every intention to run commercials that could be defined as negative. But they insisted that they had not settled on when -- and that the timing and exact content were still under discussion.</p>
        <p>''It isn't mapped out,'' said one person familiar with the advertising plans. ''This is all very fluid.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether the Bush campaign had a commercial that featured Mr. Gore's infamous appearance at a Buddhist temple for a fund-raising event, Ms. Hughes said: ''I will choose not to answer that question at this point. I don't want to tip our hand.''</p>
        <p>But, Ms. Hughes said, ''We believe that Vice President Gore's lack of credibility is an issue. There are a variety of different scripts that are in the works that deal with issues including credibility.''</p>
        <p>On the one hand, running advertisements against Mr. Gore would be the best way, as one Bush adviser put it, to ''clip Gore's wings.'' The intention would be to drive up Mr. Gore's negative ratings -- and halt his rise in the polls -- in the week since the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>But the advisers said such a move could be particularly risky for their campaign because Mr. Bush has tried to make a virtue out of his desire to stay upbeat.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gore also has to take care not to be labeled as too harsh in his advertising, the Democrats have been skillful in cloaking their negative advertising as part of issue advertisements. During the Republican convention, the Democratic Party unleashed several negative advertisements that, among other things, assailed the record of Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush's running mate.</p>
        <p>But, because the vice president never emphasized a desire to remain positive, the Gore campaign is not in the predicament that the Bush campaign is. Another factor is that given the questions that have been raised about Mr. Gore's fund-raising practices -- and the scandals of the Clinton administration -- there are more questions of a personal nature to raise about Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to go negative when you have promised not to go negative because it raises the specter of hypocrisy,'' said Darrell West, director of the Taubman Center for Public Policy at Brown University. ''They have to follow the Clinton model. Those ads in '96 often had 15 seconds of attack and 15 seconds of positive appeal. It's a great way to shield yourself from the backlash.''</p>
        <p>Mr. West also said that Mr. Gore should be careful how he attacks. ''Gore has the risk of coming across as an attack dog just because people seem to like him a little less personally,'' Mr. West said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has to be especially careful about advertisements that attack Mr. Clinton because -- as the Republican Party found in the 1998 Congressional campaign -- attempts to revisit scandals like Mr. Clinton's relationship with a White House intern can backfire.</p>
        <p>Whatever the Bush campaign does, the Republican Party intends to run tough commercials against Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''We will have ads that raise questions about Al Gore's credibility and integrity,'' said Clifford D. May, the party's communications director, ''because there are plenty of questions to be raised.''</p>
        <p>The Republican Party commercial, which was never broadcast, suggests that Mr. Gore, in saying Mr. Clinton has not uttered an untruth, was not acknowledging Mr. Clinton's misstatements about his relationship with the intern. But the advertisement was based on an interview in which Lisa Myers, a correspondent for NBC News, asked Mr. Gore about an attack he made on Oliver North, who was then running for Senate from Virginia. The exchange about Mr. North was edited out of the advertisement, which had the tag line, ''Think Al Gore will say anything?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he objected to the commercial because ''it had nothing to do with the affairs of the White House.''</p>
        <p>While the advertisement was pulled, clips of it were broadcast on national television, including ABC News and NBC News programs, as parts of stories about the campaign.</p>
        <p>But even William M. Daley, the chairman of the Gore campaign, said he did not think the Republicans were behind a plot to get free publicity for the advertisement -- while making Mr. Bush look virtuous by objecting to it.</p>
        <p>''That's a little Machiavellian,'' he said.</p>
