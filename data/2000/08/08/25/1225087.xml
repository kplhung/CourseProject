        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>John Tierney (Big City column, Aug. 18) implies that worrying about pesticides makes little sense. He argues that the age-adjusted cancer death rate has declined, but he doesn't mention cancer incidence rates.</p>
        <p>Medicine has made great strides in reducing cancer deaths. But one cannot conclude that individual cancer incidence rates are down as well.  Cancers of the reproductive organs in both men and women have risen, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has increased 75 percent since 1973, and children's cancer rates are rising.</p>
        <p>Who knows for sure how much the pesticide residue in food is contributing to our cancer rates? What we do know is that people need to reduce their total chemical exposures, because it is the accumulation of all these exposures that is the real cause for concern.</p>
        <p>NANCY ALDERMAN  North Haven, Conn., Aug. 23, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is president of Environment and Human Health.</p>
