        <p>Norway almost called off its rescue efforts for the sunken submarine Kursk because of Russian officials' interference and misinformation, a Norwegian admiral was quoted today as saying.</p>
        <p>Rear Adm. Einar Skorgen said in an interview with the Norwegian newspaper Nordlandsposten that he had told the Russians that his deep-sea divers would not be able to continue their work unless the Russians became more cooperative.</p>
        <p>''At times there were so many wrong details and disinformation from Russia that it was close to endangering the divers,'' Admiral Skorgen said. ''We couldn't rely on the information we were getting.''</p>
        <p>Among other things, he said Russian officials had said, wrongly, that undersea currents had been too strong for rescue work, that the escape hatch had been too severely damaged to allow a rescue minisubmarine to attach to it, and that the Kursk's hull was cracked.</p>
        <p>The admiral's complaints ran counter to President Vladimir V. Putin's assurances, in a half-hour television interview on Wednesday night, that accusations of incompetence in the Russian rescue effort were unfounded.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Putin and the navy have come under attack from critics who say the rescue was too slow and poorly managed, and that Mr. Putin recognized the scope of the incident only belatedly.</p>
        <p>But on Wednesday, Mr. Putin said he believed that Russian military officials moved swiftly and efficiently when the Kursk exploded and sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea just before midnight on Aug. 12. Mr. Putin also said that a much-criticized delay in accepting Norway's offer of aid was because of unidentified ''technical parameters.''</p>
        <p>Admiral Skorgen said that the Norwegian rescue effort gained ground only when he used a military hot line to reach the commander of Russia's northern fleet, Adm. Vyacheslav Popov, a colleague from earlier days of Norwegian-Russian military contacts.</p>
        <p>Admiral Skorgen called Admiral Popov three times, and each time the Russian bureaucracy yielded, he said. A team of four Norwegian and eight British divers later pried open an escape hatch and confirmed that the 118 seamen inside the Kursk were dead.</p>
        <p>Today, a senior Russian military official disputed a second complaint, from one of the British divers, that his team had been barred from using a sophisticated minisubmarine specifically designed for undersea rescues.</p>
        <p>That diver, Paddy Heron, said in an interview with BBC-Scotland television that ''any arrangement or proposed operation that they spoke about was rescinded, gone back on, altered or countermanded.''</p>
        <p>''If life was still extant,'' he said, ''undoubtedly lives were then lost by the fact that we sat doing nothing.''</p>
        <p>Col. Gen. Valery L. Manilov, the deputy chief of the Russian military general staff, called that accusation groundless at a news conference today. General Manilov said the minisubmarine was not needed after it was proved that the Kursk's crew was dead.</p>
        <p>He also insisted that the submarine's escape hatch was too severely damaged for the submersible to dock with it.</p>
        <p>Away from the recriminations, families of some of the dead crew members gathered today in the military town of Vidyayevo to lay a cornerstone for a memorial to the seamen. Later they sailed to the area  where the Kursk sank to toss flowers and wreaths onto the waters.</p>
        <p>The Kremlin, which has been stung by criticism about the sailors' scant pay and their families' dilapidated housing, said it had collected enough in donations to give each of the 118 families an additional $27,000 beyond the $7,000 in pay already awarded them.</p>
        <p>And in Murmansk, near the Kursk's home port, Russian prosecutors opened a criminal inquiry into the two explosions that sank the submarine. They gave no indication that a specific individual or group was suspected of causing the blasts.</p>
        <p>Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov said investigators would begin by trying to establish the cause of the explosions and that the course of the inquiry would be set by the evidence they find.</p>
        <p>The director of the Federal Security Service, Nikolai Patrushev, confirmed earlier reports that the submarine carried two Dagestani men who were not members of the regular crew, and said they were ''specialists from a certain Caspian enterprise.''</p>
        <p>Their presence was notable because Dagestan borders Chechnya, where Islamic guerrillas are waging war against the Russian Army, thus raising the prospect that the Kursk was sunk by a terrorist act.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Patrushev said that his intelligence service had no information to support that theory.</p>
