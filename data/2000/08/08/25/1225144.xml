        <p>The final episode of the CBS series ''Survivor'' reached an audience of more than 50 million viewers Wednesday night, eclipsing every show on television in the last year except for the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>The two-hour double episode of ''Survivor,'' which reduced four finalists to a single winner, Richard Hatch, beat every episode of series television over the last year, including ''E.R.'' the biggest regular-season hit on the networks, and even topped March's broadcast of the Academy Awards, which in every other season is second in audience only to the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>The finale even beat every night of Olympic broadcasts over the last three Olympiads. It was, CBS said, the 11th-most-watched episode of a series in the history of television.</p>
        <p>Just as impressive for CBS, a network with a reputation for rarely reaching the young adult viewers that most advertisers prefer, ''Survivor'' was strongest among viewers 18 to 34 years old. The finale reached more than 60 percent of the viewers in that age group tuned in to television from 8 to 10 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The success sets CBS up for some enormous payoffs, starting with the second edition of ''Survivor,'' set to start in January. CBS's top sales executive, Joseph Abruzzese, predicted that ''Survivor II'' would attract the highest per-commercial price of any series on television in the coming season. ''Survivor II'' will begin the night of Jan. 28, immediately after the Super Bowl, which CBS will broadcast this year.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure that's going to be the most profitable night in the history of television,'' said Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television.</p>
        <p>The Super Bowl always attracts the highest prices for commercials every television season, but the game comes with an expensive fee of hundreds of millions of dollars for rights from the National Football League. ''Survivor'' has a budget of less than $1 million an episode, and CBS co-owns the show with its executive producer, Mark Burnett.</p>
        <p>With ''Survivor II'' coming after the Super Bowl, CBS expects to charge record prices for advertising for the entire evening. David F. Poltrack, the executive vice president for research at CBS, even suggested that having ''Survivor II'' follow the game ensured that viewers would stay tuned even if the game became lopsided. ''We may have found the only programming with the potential to actually benefit the Super Bowl,'' Mr. Poltrack said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abruzzese said that advertisers, who have traditionally used the Super Bowl to introduce products and ad campaigns, were already talking about extending that strategy into the first episode of ''Survivor II.''</p>
        <p>The network is also predicting a ''Survivor'' bounce for its new lineup of fall prime-time series, all of which were heavily promoted during the 13-week run of ''Survivor.'' Mr. Poltrack said that CBS's tracking studies showed that the new CBS shows were far ahead of any coming show on any other network in terms of audience recognition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moonves declined to predict that CBS would become the leading network in prime time in the next year, but he did say, ''I think we're going to make it a very interesting season.''</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' had a total audience -- viewers who watched some portion of the show Wednesday night -- of 72 million. The average audience figure for the entire telecast was 51.7 million. It was by far the most-watched network broadcast in a summer since Nielsen Media Research began its People Meter Rating System in 1987.</p>
        <p>The entire 13-episode run of the series was an extraordinary success. It averaged a 17 rating and 30 percent share of the audience. (One rating point represents about 1.01 million households.) That would have ranked the show second among all series in television's regular season, behind only ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on ABC.</p>
        <p>Mr. Poltrack said that ''Survivor'' undoubtedly had more viewers than officially counted. ''About 20 percent of the people in America are on vacation in the months of June, July and August,'' Mr. Poltrack said. ''Those people were surely watching in motels and hotels, but they weren't being counted.''</p>
        <p>CBS saw some additional immediate advantages from its enormous night. At the CBS local station in New York, WCBS, rating for its late news soared by almost 200 percent. The network's late-night star David Letterman brought on the 16 ''Survivor'' contestants for a Top 10 list -- featuring Mr. Hatch going naked -- and scored his third-highest rating this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moonves also said CBS hoped to begin cashing in on an extensive merchandising effort, selling ''Survivor''-related products, from hats and T-shirts to camping equipment. The network has already released an e-book and will soon release a conventional book based on the show, along with a board game from Mattel and a CD of music from the show.</p>
        <p>Many of the cast members have also made deals for themselves, but Mr. Hatch is obviously in the best position. In a telephone interview yesterday, he declined to discuss what deals he had made, though he acknowledged that he was considering writing his own book.</p>
        <p>The other biggest winner from the show's spectacular success is the producer, Mr. Burnett. Mr. Moonves said yesterday that the ownership deal on the show was ''extremely complicated,'' but that Mr. Burnett was entitled to a portion of the advertising revenue from ''Survivor,'' both for this edition and future ones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abruzzese said that Mr. Burnett helped sell the show to the nine sponsors who signed on before the show began, including Reebok shoes, Budweiser beer, Target stores and Ericsson phones. ''They got one of the best deals ever, tremendous bang for their buck,'' Mr. Moonves said.</p>
        <p>But once the show became a hit, CBS began selling an additional minute of advertising in the show each week, mainly to movie companies. CBS extended the finale from one hour to two hours and had the whole second hour to sell at new prices, which reached as high as $600,000 for a 30-second commercial. The network also sold the hourlong discussion show that followed, at lower rates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burnett shared in all that new advertising revenue. ''He got half and we got half,'' Mr. Abruzzese said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moonves said, ''Mark Burnett is definitely becoming a very wealthy man.''</p>
