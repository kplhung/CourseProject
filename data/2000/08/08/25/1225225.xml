        <p>Across the country, cutting taxes may not be the political weapon it once was, as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas seems to be discovering on the presidential campaign trail. But in New Jersey, where property taxes remain the nation's highest per capita, the idea never loses currency.</p>
        <p>The state already devotes $10.1 billion, or nearly half its budget, to one form of property tax relief or another. And today, the president of the State Senate, Donald T. DiFrancesco, a leading contender for the Republican nomination for governor next year, proposed increasing that relief by $400 million, both in higher rebates to homeowners and in greater state aid to municipalities.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiFrancesco said at a news conference at the State House today that the added tax relief could easily be paid for by using the growth in state revenues, which he projected at $1.4 billion next year, and without cutting services or eroding the state's mounting surpluses.</p>
        <p>His plan, which would have to be included in the budget negotiated next year, would not take effect until the fiscal year beginning in July 2001. It would include more than doubling the size of rebate checks for the elderly, under a program called NJ Saver, from $240, on average, to $500; indexing homestead yearly rebate checks to the rate of inflation, and raising the cap on such rebates from $500, to $750; and increasing a block-grant program of per-capita aid to municipalities, now at $33 million, by $100 million over three years.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiFrancesco said it ''would be the most significant tax relief program in one year in state history, without raising other taxes.''</p>
        <p>But Democratic lawmakers, who have been agitating for greater property tax rebates for years, pounced on it as a tacit acknowledgment that Republican legislators, along with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, had failed to do enough until now.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Joseph S. Suliga said Mr. DiFrancesco's proposal ''borrows heavily from ideas that Democratic legislators have long put forward as antidotes to Governor Whitman's skewed fiscal priorities.''</p>
        <p>And Jon J. Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, said Mr. DiFrancesco's proposals were politically palatable but fell well short of what was needed to reduce the tax burden on middle-class homeowners. He said the state ought to look at new ways to tax ''paper wealth'' in addition to property.</p>
        <p>But James W. Hughes, dean of the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, said Mr. DiFrancesco's plan amounted to ''a positive incremental approach.''</p>
