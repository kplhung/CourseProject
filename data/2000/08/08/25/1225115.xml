        <p>A CAMPAIGN season is usually a time for airing dirty laundry.</p>
        <p>That is the case at Unilever's laboratory in Edgewater, N.J., where filthy socks fetch $3 a pair and soiled shirts are bought for $15 each -- all in service of a coming marketing campaign to introduce a revamped old product.</p>
        <p>''There's a constant search for dirty clothes,'' said Sebastian Munden, the British-Dutch company's North American laundry projects director. ''We can never get enough.''</p>
        <p>Unilever is locked in a race with Procter &amp; Gamble to reacquaint American consumers with the laundry tablet, a product they have not seen since the late 1970's. The repackaging effort is part of a strategy to shed the company's more obscure, ancillary products and pour resources into marketing Wisk detergent and other core brands including Ragu spaghetti sauce, Wish-Bone salad dressing and Lipton tea.</p>
        <p>The company is convinced that coming up with new ways to squeeze more sales from its stalwarts is the surest path to growth in a slow-moving, somewhat beleaguered industry. Hence, the new Wisk Dual Action Laundry Tablets, bound for stores in December.</p>
        <p>''I've often heard people talk of mature categories and tired brands, but in the consumer products market I don't buy it,'' said Charles Strauss, president and chief executive of Unilever's United States operations. ''There are no tired brands; there are only tired brand managers.''</p>
        <p>The new Wisk tablets, according to the company's news release announcing the planned introduction, ''offer the convenience of a measured dose with excellent cleaning.'' They are ''designed to dissolve quickly at the beginning of the wash cycle,'' correcting a critical failure of tablets in the first go-round.</p>
        <p>For Procter &amp; Gamble, whose Salvo tablets were introduced in 1960 and then taken off shelves in 1978 because they did not always dissolve well, the stakes are also high. After several quarters of disheartening financial results that led to a management shake-up, P.&amp; G.'s stock has plunged more than 40 percent this year. The company, which has been casting off brands to concentrate on market leaders, hopes that Tide Rapid Action Tablets, the new incarnation of one of its flagship brands, will help ease the pain. The tablets, which have a special coating so that they dissolve immediately in the washer, will be available in stores in September.</p>
        <p>Neither company expects consumers will suddenly do more laundry, just to satisfy their curiosity over chalky tablets that fizz up like giant Alka-Seltzers in the washing machine. But the products' widespread popularity abroad has convinced the two rivals that convenience commands a premium price, resulting in greater revenues as consumers abandon their measuring cups in favor of the no-mess tablets.</p>
        <p>In Britain, where Unilever introduced a laundry tablet in 1998, followed by Procter &amp; Gamble roughly a year later, tablets make up more than 20 percent of the $1.5 billion laundry market; together, the companies' tablets command more than 50 percent of the tablet market. Propelled by a blitz of advertising created by agencies like Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, for P.&amp; G., and Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic, for Unilever, and the muscle of the two consumer products giants, the tablets have been introduced into dozens of countries in little more than a year.</p>
        <p>Why the delay in bringing tablets to the United States market, with roughly $6 billion in laundry detergent sales annually? Mr. Strauss says the technology was developed overseas and had to be adapted for this country's top-loading quick-cycle machines that tend to use colder water.</p>
        <p>Unilever said that it was reviewing marketing approaches it has used elsewhere in the world and that Lowe Lintas was just starting to look at how to market the tablets in the United States. The campaign, the company said in the news release, would include ''TV and print advertising, Internet, and promotional special events,'' with the Alcone Marketing Group, a unit of the Diversified Agency Services unit of the Omnicom Group, assigned to promotions.</p>
        <p>Procter &amp; Gamble declined to discuss details of its tablet strategy, but did say that Saatchi &amp; Saatchi would conduct the ad campaign in this country.</p>
        <p>According to Brandweek, print ads for Tide tablets are set to begin in November and run for six months, and TV ads will appear from January through June.</p>
        <p>After trailing in tablets in most international markets, P.&amp; G. is poised to leapfrog its competitor and put Tide tablets into stores in the United States about three months before Unilever's Wisk tablets. But Unilever has sent assembly line workers from a plant in Georgia to Italy to learn how to pack its new product quickly, hoping to shave days off the time to market.</p>
        <p>''If you lose days and weeks then you get worried,'' Mr. Munden of Unilever said. ''Because you know those days and weeks count.''</p>
        <p>For Unilever, the tablets are one outcome of more than a decade of whittling away extraneous business ventures. Since the 1980's, it has cast off its fish restaurants, trucking business, printing and chemical companies. In February, the company said it would pare its 1,400 consumer products to 400 core brands that generate about 80 percent of its income.</p>
        <p>Since then, Unilever has posted two strong quarters and surpassed analysts' forecasts, quite an achievement in a sector where warnings of missed earnings have become commonplace. It has also gone on a shopping spree, buying Slim-Fast Foods, Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade and Bestfoods within months of one another, a strategy consistent with the company's singular attention to big-name products.</p>
        <p>But other than the introduction of Dove deodorant earlier this year, none of the surviving Unilever brands has received the attention the company is now dedicating to Wisk tablets. Unilever hopes these throwbacks to the 1970's will take as much as 20 percent of the laundry market within two years.</p>
        <p>Stranger things have happened. After all, platform shoes and skin-tight jeans are back in style.</p>
