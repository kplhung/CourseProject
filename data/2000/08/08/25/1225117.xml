        <p>Builders are nearing completion of the first of four planned structures in a complex that will offer housing and a variety of services to homeless and low-income people in East New York, Brooklyn, and the sponsor is already inundated with applications.</p>
        <p>More than 1,500 people have applied for 26 of the 52 apartments in the first building of the Genesis Neighborhood Plaza. Tenants for the remaining 26 apartments will be chosen from homeless shelters.</p>
        <p>''There will be a preference for people escaping domestic violence, but that will not be a requirement,'' said Richard P. Motta, president of Help USA, the sponsor of the project,  during a recent tour of the site.</p>
        <p>Genesis Neighborhood Plaza will be the 10th residence in New York City operated by Help USA, which is also active in six other cities. The organization was founded in 1986 by Andrew M. Cuomo to provide homes, jobs and services to homeless or impoverished people.</p>
        <p>Because he is now Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Mr. Cuomo is no longer affiliated with the organization, but he said, ''What I learned there is what we are now doing with public housing across the country: taking down failed high-rises and building smaller, less dense, more open, architecturally significant complexes with on-site services.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the 52 apartments, the Genesis Neighborhood Plaza project's first building, at 354 Snediker Avenue, will include a medical center. The second building, on which work is to start in the spring, is to have 69 apartments for homeless families. The third, for which money is now being raised, will be a community center. No date has been set for its construction. The fourth, to use existing buildings that will be bought in the future, will be developed as commercial space.</p>
        <p>Across the street is a separate project sponsored by Help USA, Genesis Homes at 330 Hinsdale Street, which provides permanent housing for 77 formerly homeless families and 72 low-income families. Half a block away is Help I, which has 189 units of transitional housing. Within three blocks are about 200 homes sponsored by a citywide coalition of religious congregations under its Nehemiah Houses program.</p>
        <p>A list of possible tenants for the first 26 apartments at Genesis Neighborhood Plaza has been compiled by lottery from those who responded to newspaper ads. Candidates will be interviewed in a detailed selection process until the apartments are filled. Those selected must fit the definition of low income: no more than 60 percent of the median income for New York City, a ceiling of $33,720 for a family of four. Once admitted, they are permitted to earn more. Rents will range from $400 to $600 a month, depending on the size of the apartment and the income of the family.</p>
        <p>The residents will be moving not only into an apartment but into a community with day care centers, job training programs, counseling, health care, recreational programs and other social services. The medical suite and a job training center, both open to the community at large, are being integrated into the ground floor of the first building.</p>
        <p>Though small, the apartments, which will include eight studios (340 square feet), five one-bedrooms (535 square feet) and 39 two-bedrooms (660 square feet) were designed with families in mind, said Amie Gross, president of Amie Gross Architects. ''We anticipate that most of the residents will be single mothers with two or three children and we know that children need to be separated by space,'' she said, ''so we created a homework area that will include the computer. Kitchens will have low walls so mom can always observe what is going on in the living room.''</p>
        <p>The goal for completion of the first building is November. It cost $10.2 million, about $7 million of which came through the Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program and more than $3 million from a New York City tax incentive program.</p>
        <p>Construction of the 69-apartment second building is expected to cost $13 million. Help USA has been awarded a $5 million grant from the state and hopes to receive a $7 million mortgage, contingent on a contract with the city's Human Resources Administration, Mr. Motta said. The building is to have space for seven retail stores.</p>
        <p>The third building is to be a community center costing $6 to $7 million; the financing source has not yet been determined.</p>
        <p>According to Ms. Gross, the process routinely used by organizations in such ventures was reversed in this case. ''Normally, there is a pot of money available from the state, federal government or city, and the agency builds according to what is available,'' she said. ''In this case, the master plan was done about two years ago before any money was raised.</p>
        <p>''Help already owned the land and had two other projects, Genesis Homes and Help I, in place,'' she continued. ''What it didn't have was all the components you need to make a neighborhood. We identified early on that retail had to be part of the project, that there was virtually no day care available and that there was a lack of space for after-school activities that will be built into the community center.''</p>
        <p>Though some people would have preferred to see moderate-income  housing in the once-desolate area, there was no discernible opposition to the plan.</p>
        <p>''There was no attitude of 'Nimby,' not in my backyard,'' said Jeannette Ruffins, executive director of both Genesis developments, ''because no one would call this their backyard.''</p>
