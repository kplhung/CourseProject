        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio moved to distance himself from Gov. George W. Bush's tax cut plan today, offering his own package of business and personal tax reductions that by his campaign's calculation is nearly 40 percent smaller than the one Mr. Bush has made a cornerstone of his presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's proposal for the use of a projected $4.4 trillion, 10-year surplus, which he outlined in a speech at the Chamber of Commerce here, includes a call to allow taxpayers to deduct the payroll tax from their federal income taxes, much the way state and property taxes are now treated. His plan would affect the payroll tax that finances the Social Security Trust Fund. Mr. Lazio said that proposal, combined with a menu of tax cuts long advocated by Congressional Republicans -- like eliminating the inheritance tax and the so-called marriage penalty -- would save the average New York family about $3,000 a year in taxes.</p>
        <p>He also proposed permitting parents to put aside up to $500, free of tax, to pay for primary and secondary education in parochial and other private schools.</p>
        <p>''The idea that the surplus ultimately belongs to the American people is not conservative or liberal, it's not even Republican or Democrat -- it's just common sense,'' said Mr. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate. ''And if I'm senator, New Yorkers will get to keep more of what they earn. My opponent believes there's no room in a $4.4 trillion surplus for meaningful tax relief for New York families. I believe simple fairness demands that we give taxpayers a break.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's speech today came in a week in which Mr. Bush has found himself defending the fiscal prudence of his $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut, in the face of attacks by Democrats and polling data suggesting that the idea has not stirred much interest among voters. And in New York, Mr. Lazio's opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has repeatedly sought to link Mr. Lazio to Republican tax cut proposals that she has said are too broad and has described as a threat to the nation's future prosperity. Mr. Lazio's response today suggested some concern in his campaign about that line of attack.</p>
        <p>The 27-minute speech by Mr. Lazio, of Suffolk County, signaled, as well, a coming to life of a campaign that has been somewhat dormant for much of the summer.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Lazio's advisers said that he had intentionally kept a low profile while campaigning in order to raise money and to give himself time to become acquainted with issues, and in the belief that he benefited from keeping attention off himself and on Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>With Labor Day, the traditional start of the general election campaign, less than 10 days away, Mr. Lazio is moving into a new, higher-profile phase of his campaign; today's speech was the first in what aides said would be a series of addresses intended to flesh out his political portrait.</p>
        <p>In addition to invoking an issue that Republicans have seized on in election after election over the past two decades -- tax cuts -- Mr. Lazio today seemed to be making a definite effort to move away from Mr. Bush's tax cut plan, if not the Republican presidential candidate himself. A campaign press release put the cost of Mr. Lazio's tax cut at $776 billion over the next 10 years. ''By comparison,'' Mr. Lazio's campaign said,  ''George W. Bush's tax plan would cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years, and Al Gore's tax plan would cost around $500 billion over 10 years.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Lazio, in a news conference, was notably cool to Mr. Bush's tax plan, which Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly criticized as excessive. ''I am comfortable with the plan that I have laid out right now, in terms of raw size, the macro number,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''I'm going to keep my options open on what Governor Bush's proposal is until we see what kind of revenues come in next year. I just prefer to make sure that we have a restrained approach that will allow a pay-down of the debt, will allow us to invest in the prescription benefit, and will give us the ability to have some enhanced investment in education at the same time.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's advisers moved to tether Mr. Lazio to Mr. Bush's economic policies. They asserted that his estimate of the cost of his tax cut was grossly understated -- they put it at $1.24 trillion over 10 years -- and said it would undermine the country's economic health.</p>
        <p>''Rick Lazio offers New Yorkers yet another reckless trillion-dollar tax plan that simply doesn't hold up,'' said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign. ''The Republican tax program would return us to the days of irresponsible budgets, ballooning deficits, and high interest rates.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has proposed a far more modest plan of tax reductions that would total $496 billion, her aides said today. They would include a reduction, rather than elimination, of the marriage penalty and inheritance tax, and tax credits for such things as college tuition. She said that the nation's surplus first should be used to pay down the country's debt and to shore up the Social Security program.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece, and most unusual aspect, of Mr. Lazio's plan today was to allow taxpayers to deduct the payroll tax from their federal income taxes. Such proposals have been raised in Congress before, but usually discarded, both because they would be hugely expensive and would offer more of a benefit to wealthier taxpayers in higher-income tax brackets.</p>
        <p>The payroll tax affected, the one that finances the Social Security fund, is 6.2 percent this year for individuals on the first $76,200 of income; employers put in another 6.2 percent. Mr. Lazio said his proposal would cost the government $300 billion; Mrs. Clinton's aides put the figure at closer to $500 billion.</p>
        <p>The remainder of Mr. Lazio's's tax-reduction program is made up of a number of more familiar Republican initiatives. Mr. Lazio called for cutting the capital gains tax from 20 percent to 15 percent, increasing allowable I.R.A. contributions to $5,000 from $2,000, and eliminating part of the tax on Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio used his speech today to offer his own response to what has been a political complication for Republicans running for office this year: the state of the economy. Calling the country's financial health ''a wave of economic prosperity unrivaled in human history,'' the congressman disputed the Democrats' claims of credit for it.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Lazio attributed the nation's economic well-being to, among other things, tax cuts initiated by President Ronald Reagan and actions by the Federal Reserve to control interest rates. And he reiterated his opposition to the economic program pushed through by President Clinton at the start of his presidency, which included tax increases to reduce the nation's deficit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has repeatedly invoked that legislation as a turning point.</p>
