        <p>The attempt by the United States to repeat as Olympic champion in women's soccer, already made difficult by an arduous schedule, was further threatened yesterday when Michelle Akers announced her retirement from international competition, saying she would not participate in next month's Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Akers, 34, is considered by many as the greatest player in the history of the women's game, but her relentless style forced her to battle through repeated injuries, including at least a dozen knee surgeries. For eight years she has battled a blood pressure disorder associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, which left her exhausted and in need of intravenous fluids after nearly every game.</p>

        <p>The attempt by the United States to repeat as Olympic champion in women's soccer, already made difficult by an arduous schedule, was further threatened yesterday when Michelle Akers announced her retirement from international competition, saying she would not participate in next month's Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Akers, 34, is considered by many as the greatest player in the history of the women's game, but her relentless style forced her to battle through repeated injuries, including at least a dozen knee surgeries. For eight years she has battled a blood pressure disorder associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, which left her exhausted and in need of intravenous fluids after nearly every game.</p>
        <p>After dominating the midfield against China in the final match of the 1999 Women's World Cup, the 5-foot-10-inch, 150-pound Akers seldom played in the past year. In March, she suffered a dislocated right shoulder and underwent surgery. She said last night that she reinjured the shoulder in a recent match against Russia and would again need surgery, making it impossible to play in the Olympics.</p>
        <p>''The blood pressure was still a problem, and the shoulder was the last straw,'' Akers said in a telephone interview. ''It was impossible for me to battle through this one. Enough was enough. I was hungry to play, but my body was falling apart. Last year took a huge chunk out of me. This year has been a battle. But at least I know I tried everything possible to make it. I won't be kicking myself for the rest of my life because I didn't try. It was just impossible.''</p>
        <p>With Akers gone, the Americans lose an original member of the women's national team, which was formed in 1985. She was also the first woman to sign a soccer shoe endorsement and one of only four women who has scored more than 100 goals in international play.</p>
        <p>One of three alternates -- Michelle French, Nandi Price or Christie Welch -- will replace Akers on the 18-member Olympic team. Nikki Serlenga and Lorrie Fair have been starting in her place at defensive midfield, but neither has the experience, presence or reliability on penalty kicks of Akers. The Chinese were clearly intimidated by her in the final of the World Cup.</p>
        <p>Now the Americans must open the Olympics against Norway and China, their toughest opponents, without their most assertive player.</p>

        <p>Arbitrator Rules for Wrestler</p>
        <p>COLORADO SPRINGS, Aug. 24, (AP) -- An arbitrator ruled today that Keith Sieracki's victory in the Greco-Roman wrestling trials should stand and he will represent the United States at 167 1/2 pounds in Sydney next month.</p>
        <p>Sieracki defeated Matt Lindland in the trials in Dallas in June. But Lindland protested, claiming he had been tripped. His argument was denied twice by USA Wrestling, but Lindland then filed for arbitration. He was granted a rematch by an arbitrator and defeated Sieracki.</p>
        <p>Sieracki filed his own arbitration and that was the ruling issued today.</p>
