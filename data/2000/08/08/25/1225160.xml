        <p>Shrugging off a veto threat, Republican leaders revved up a red tractor and dispatched a Montana cattle rancher to ride from Capitol Hill to the White House today to deliver their latest tax-cutting proposal, a bill to repeal the federal estate tax.</p>
        <p>The Republican bill would phase out the tax over the next decade.</p>
        <p>But, there is as much political symbolism in the bill's passage as in the tractor ride through busy Washington streets.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the bill say it will help those families who pass down their farms and small businesses from one generation to the next.</p>
        <p>But President Clinton is expected to veto the legislation in the next few days on the ground that it will benefit mostly the rich, not farmers and owners of small businesses. The estate tax is levied on about 2 percent of all estates -- usually those worth more than $675,000, but provisions of the tax code lift the threshold to $1.3 million for family-owned farms and businesses.</p>
        <p>Democrats say they prefer smaller, more focused cuts that preserve more of the surplus for other proposals. ''The more people learn about the dangerous exploding nature of this tax plan, the less they like it,'' said Jake Siewert, a White House spokesman.</p>
        <p>The showdown over tax cuts comes just as the presidential and Congressional elections kick into high gear, giving Democrats and Republicans a classic issue they can take to voters to underscore their differences.</p>
        <p>''It draws the contrast between what do you do with the surplus,'' said Representative Thomas M. Davis III, Republican of Virginia. ''Republicans want to give the surplus back and Democrats want to spend it. Since we can't agree, it goes to paying down the debt.''</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee, who spent the day discussing his overall tax-cutting plan, supports repeal of the estate tax. His Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, prefers a narrower retooling of exemptions to benefit farmers and small business owners.</p>
        <p>Today, at a farmer's market in South Carolina, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert appealed to Mr. Clinton to ''listen to the farmers and small businesses of our country'' and not veto the repeal of the estate tax.</p>
        <p>''This unfair tax is so steep that sometimes the deceased owner's children must break up a farm or sell a business just to cover the tax,'' said Mr. Hastert, a Republican from Illinois. ''Your children should not have to sell what you worked your whole lives to produce.''</p>
        <p>Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Democrats empathize with farmers and would like to offer them a tax break. But the tax break should not be geared towards the rich, Mr. Rangel said.</p>
        <p>''The Republican leaders aren't really interested in getting anything enacted that benefits the family farmer or small business owner,'' he said. ''All they want is an excuse to hold more political stunts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert spearheaded a strategy this year that chopped up a larger Republican tax cut package, which Mr. Clinton vetoed last year, into smaller chunks. The estate tax is one of them. That approach has made it more difficult for Democrats to oppose the tax cuts, which are popular among voters, and it has allowed Republicans to fend off accusations that they are a do-nothing Congress.</p>
        <p>To override a veto, a two-thirds majority is needed in both the House and the Senate. But the bill is not expected to pull that many votes in the Senate, and perhaps not in the House, either.</p>
        <p>This month, the President vetoed another Republican tax cut, one intended for married couples. Republicans are expected to try to override that veto as well. If the estate tax bill is also vetoed, Republicanss could hold votes to override the two vetoes soon after Labor Day.</p>
