        <p>''DON GIOVANNI.''

The production is the work of the imaginative director Robin Guarino; Joel Revzen conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Koussevitzky Arts Center, Berkshire Community College, 1350 West Street, Pittsfield, Mass. Tickets: $20 to $60; (413) 443-7400 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>

        <p>GLIMMERGLASS OPERA. The lakeside Glimmerglass Opera outside this lovely village offers three of its productions over the weekend. A new ''La Boheme,'' which updates Puccini's opera to World War I, plays tonight  at 8 and Sunday at 2 p.m.; Kelley Nassief and Raul Hernandez are Mimi and Rodolfo. At tomorrow's matinee of ''Acis and Galatea,'' Handel's marvelous score and slight drama are given a cheerful treatment and some good singing by Christine Brandes and Dean Elzinga. More difficult to recommend is tomorrow night's ''Salome.'' Elizabeth Byrne and Ned Barth are strong performers, but Leon Major's staging dives dangerously deep into histrionics. Tomorrow at 1:30 and 8 p.m. Alice Busch Theater, on Route 80 eight miles north of Cooperstown. Tickets: $45 to $90; (607) 547-2255 (Bernard Holland).</p>
        <p>''MADAMA BUTTERFLY.'' Daniel Beckwith, a quite impressive young conductor who came up through the Metropolitan Opera, has been working fruitfully as a co-director of the enterprising Lake George Opera Festival, which presents productions at the Amphitheater of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Tomorrow night Mr. Beckwith will be on the podium for a performance of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' with a promising cast headed by the soprano Cynthia Lawrence in the title role and the tenor David Corman as Pinkerton. The bucolic environs are lovely, and lawn seating is available. Tomorrow at 8:15 p.m. Tickets: $17.50 to $37.50; lawn seats, $13; (518) 587-3330 (Tommasini).</p>

There is no better place in New York City to experience chamber music with the proper intimacy than at the concerts presented by Bargemusic, the rewarding weekly series that takes place on an acoustically ideal and commodious barge in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge. This weekend's performers are especially fine. Tonight and tomorrow night you can hear the pianist Mihae Lee, the hornist William Purvis and the violinist David Kim performing Brahms's popular Horn Trio, as well as works by Schumann and Prokofiev. On Sunday afternoon, the acclaimed flutist Carol Wincenc, the superb cellist Ronald Thomas and the elegant violist Cynthia Phelps are among the performers in a program of Saint-Saens, Debussy and Brahms.

        <p>MOSTLY MOZART. The 34th season of this popular festival comes to an end this weekend with a weirdly balanced but potentially interesting program. Before the intermission Gerard Schwarz will lead the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra and the Riverside Choral Society, with Harolyn Blackwell, soprano, and Peter Rose, bass, in selections from Weber's ''Freischutz.'' In the second half of the program, those forces are to be joined by Kristine Jepson, mezzo-soprano, and Anthony Dean Griffey, tenor, for a performance of Mozart's Mass in C minor. There is also a preconcert recital by a period instrument trio -- Mark Kroll, fortepianist, Carol Lieberman, violinist, and Arthur Fiacco, cello -- offering a Beethoven Violin Sonata and Hummel's arrangements of Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro'' Overture and Weber's ''Freischutz'' Overture.

Born and trained in Florida, and now organist of the First Presbyterian Church of Pine Bluff, Ark., Mr. Ryall offers two big works: Mendelssohn's Second Sonata and the Suite ''Medievale'' by Jean Langlais, whose mystical-modal and virtuoso style is close to that of the early organ works of his contemporary, Messiaen.

        <p>TANGLEWOOD. The Boston Symphony Orchestra's summer residency at Tanglewood ends this weekend with three concerts that cut a wide swath through the Romantic repertory. Tonight at 8:30, the violinist Joshua Bell plays the Sibelius Concerto on a program otherwise devoted to the Mahler Symphony No. 1. Rafael Frubeck de Burgos conducts. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Andre Previn leads an all-Strauss concert at which Felicity Lott will sing the ''Four Last Songs'' and James Sommerville will be the soloist in the Horn Concerto.
