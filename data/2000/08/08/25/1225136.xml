        <p>Each year the United States spends $98 billion caring for 16 million people with diabetes, and researchers reported this week that the disease is rapidly growing. Although we are able to control diabetes, only rarely do we cure it.</p>
        <p>Most diabetics have adult onset, or Type 2, diabetes, which can often be managed with diet or pills. But as their disease overworks the islet cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, over time even many of these patients risk death without insulin shots. In those who have Type 1, or juvenile onset, diabetes, the body's immune system attacks and kills the islet cells. These people are faced with a lifetime of dietary restraints, finger sticks and insulin injections.</p>
        <p>Pancreas transplantation is a cure for diabetes, though like all transplant surgery it has complications and risks of its own. But because there are only 5,000 to 6,000 pancreases a year from brain-dead organ donors, and not all are suitable, only about 1,000 transplants are done.</p>
        <p>There is an exciting new breakthrough in the treatment of diabetes, reported last month in The New England Journal of Medicine. Instead of using the entire pancreas, researchers in Edmonton, Alberta, isolated the islet cells and simply injected them into patients' livers. They were able to cure seven diabetics. But to treat one patient, islet cells from two or more donor pancreases had to be used.</p>
        <p>A way around the donor shortage is to grow islet cells in the laboratory. This sounds much easier than it is: normal adult cells cannot grow and divide indefinitely in a test tube.</p>
        <p>But special cells, called stem cells, do have this capacity. If they could be coaxed to become islet cells, we would be able to treat every diabetic with an islet cell transplant. Not only that, but with stem cell technology we may be able to grow cells to treat patients with brain and spinal cord trauma, stroke, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, muscular dystrophy, liver failure and many other conditions.</p>
        <p>There is a catch, however. Until recently, the only known source of stem cells has been the human embryo, and because there was a strict ban on federal financing of research involving embryonic or fetal tissues, progress has been slow. That is why Wednesday's announcement that the National Institutes of Health has agreed to finance research with certain cells derived from embryos is so exciting to doctors and their patients.</p>
        <p>Before the announcement, using private sources of money, scientists at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Wisconsin took embryonic cells and with painstaking effort grew stem cells from them in the laboratory. These cells have now grown and divided so many times that they are only remotely related to the original cells that came from embryos.</p>
        <p>Some of the cells for this research came from frozen embryos -- the same source that the N.I.H. has now approved for federal funding. Because in vitro fertilization generates more embryos than are used, some are frozen for a period of time and then discarded. Opponents argue that embryonic stem cell research destroys a human life. But these embryos would otherwise be thrown in the trash.</p>
        <p>Other cells used in this stem cell project came from an even more controversial source, one which should be freely allowed: tissue from early therapeutic abortion.</p>
        <p>A new argument against the use of embryos is that adult stem cells can be used. But these cells are rare and difficult to obtain. They are not well characterized, and it is unclear if they will prove beneficial for the treatment of disease. For now, research on both the adult cells and the embryonic cells should continue, so that we can see which in the end will work best in developing cures.</p>
        <p>Millions of Americans suffer from dreadful chronic diseases; one of them is diabetes, which threatens lives and may lead to kidney failure, blindness, nerve damage, heart disease and stroke. We must support the research that may someday help so many.</p>
