        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak said today that if peace talks with the Palestinians failed, he was prepared within ''a few weeks'' to invite Israel's conservative opposition to join in a broad government of ''national unity.''</p>
        <p>The proposal was immediately rejected by the leader of the opposition Likud, Ariel Sharon, a hawkish former general, who was suggested by Mr. Barak as a possible foreign minister in a coalition government. But it was widely perceived as a warning to the Palestinians that if they fail to break the negotiating deadlock soon, they may ultimately be confronted with a government far less amenable to compromise on central issues of territory and Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>The proposal was also seen as a warning to Orthodox religious parties that have quit Mr. Barak's coalition in protest over the peace negotiations. Last week, the prime minister said he planned to launch a ''civic revolution'' that would challenge many of the powers and privileges of the Jewish religious establishment, and a coalition with the secular Likud could advance that initiative.</p>
        <p>The Israeli leader, in two radio interviews, coupled his proposal for a governing alliance between his Labor Party and Likud -- an uneasy left-right coalition that Israel last saw in the late 1980's -- with a challenge to Mr. Sharon, the Likud leader, to prove Likud's credentials as a secular party and join him in such a  ''civic revolution.'' Mr. Barak's plan to challenge the entrenched power of ultra-Orthodox groups, and even of more moderate Jewish institutions, stunned Israelis when he unveiled it last weekend.</p>
        <p>''The Likud, under Ariel Sharon's leadership, is certainly a natural partner to this social and civil agenda,'' Mr. Barak said in an interview with Israel radio. He added: ''I call on the Likud people to lend a shoulder to this march -- they are people who, just like you and me, want security and peace and a proper civil society. On this issue we are in the same boat.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon has said he opposes every major component of a peace deal that President Clinton put forward and Mr. Barak tentatively accepted at the recent summit meeting at Camp David. The deal included a compromise on Jerusalem and an Israeli withdrawal from 90 percent of the West Bank, including the strategic Jordan Valley. The Likud leader has also rejected the proposal to reduce the power of the Jewish religious establishment, calling it a political stunt that goes far beyond anything most Israelis would accept.</p>
        <p>In rejecting Mr. Barak's proposals, Mr. Sharon said that the prime minister should accept ''his failures,'' including the Camp David collapse and the disintegration of Mr. Barak's majority in the Israeli Parliament, and bow to an early election -- an event many Israelis believe would put Mr. Barak at a disadvantage because he might be forced to defend the controversial concessions offered at Camp David without the countervailing benefit of a final peace to offer voters. ''Given his numerous concessions, particularly on Jerusalem, and his failures on the domestic scene, there is no place for us in the Barak government,'' Mr. Sharon said.</p>
        <p>In making these proposals, Mr. Barak appeared to have staged a high-risk political raid, one aimed at breaking the mold of current Israeli politics and reversing the tables on his domestic opponents -- all apparently without consulting most of his closest political associates.</p>
        <p>The surprise, and uncertainty about Mr. Barak's motives, were all the greater for the fact that it was only 15 months ago that he won a landslide victory in Israel's first direct election contest for the post of prime minister. That event, coupled with Mr. Barak's forging of the broad One Israel coalition that united parties of the left, center and right, raised widespread hopes among Israel's 5.9 million people, tired by the controversy and combativeness of the previous prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that Israel might be in for a period of greater political stability.</p>
        <p>As Israelis struggled to absorb Mr. Barak's moves, two views prevailed, reflecting the increasingly sharp divide among Israelis over Mr. Barak. One, put forward by Mr. Sharon and his Likud associates, was that Mr. Barak is ''flailing about'' for more promising political ground as he sees his peace bid foundering, and seeking by any means to avoid an election he would be far from certain of winning. The other, favored by Israelis who badly want a peace agreement, and by those who have exhausted their patience with the power of ultra-Orthodox Jews, was that Mr. Barak had come up with a one-two knockout punch that at a stroke put him back into the driver's seat of Israeli politics.</p>
        <p>In this view, Mr. Barak, with his warning of an early Likud alliance, maximized whatever slim chance there might be of reaching an early peace agreement with Mr. Arafat, and prepared a political fallback position in the event that no peace pact is forthcoming. Likud, Mr. Barak's supporters said, would have to be wary of entering an election in which Mr. Barak could present himself as the weary battler for what he has called ''a brave peace,'' and as the first Israeli prime minister ready to confront the Jewish religious establishment head-on. Alternatively, it could join in the alliance proffered by Mr. Barak, but with the dual handicap of being a minority partner and prolonging Mr. Barak's power.</p>
        <p>In making his proposal, Mr. Barak's overriding concern appeared to be with the peace effort, and on this he struck a deeply cautious note. In the face of Mr. Arafat's insistence that Palestinians want all of East Jerusalem in a peace agreement -- or no agreement at all -- Mr. Barak said, in effect, that Israel could live without a peace pact.</p>
        <p>''If it should become evident that we are unable, despite our tremendous efforts, to reach a peace of the brave -- and I will not make peace at any price or by any date, and certainly not the peace of an ostrich with its head stuck in the sand -- if this is impossible with our neighbors, then the proper thing to do is to expand the government and establish a broad coalition,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Over all, prospects for a peace agreement have appeared to darken in recent days, with Mr. Arafat returning from a 20-nation foreign tour insistent that he will not compromise on Jerusalem, and Dennis Ross, the State Department's peace envoy, shuttling between the two sides here in the past week with no apparent success in breaking the deadlock. Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat have been exchanging long-distance taunts, with today Mr. Barak's turn. ''The ball is entirely in the other side's court,'' he said. ''It is in Arafat's court.''</p>
        <p>Many Israelis think that the really explosive issue for Mr. Barak may not be his peace proposals, but his challenge to Israel's religious powers. In outlining those changes, he said it was time for Israel to have a constitution that would give it a fuller panoply of equal rights protections. He also called for the dismantling of the Religious Affairs Ministry, provisions for civil marriages that would not require the approval of the rabbinate, and a new military call-up law that would oblige members of ultra-Orthodox families, currently exempted from army service, to do service in the civilian sector.</p>
        <p>The proposals appear to have finalized the divorce between Mr. Barak and the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, with a politically crucial bloc of 17 parliamentary seats, which quit the ruling coalition in July in protest against the concessions Mr. Barak carried to Camp David. Shas leaders have said that Mr. Barak has ''declared a holy war on religion, which he wants to eradicate from the state,'' but Mr. Barak said today that this was nonsense. ''We have no intention of leading anything which is anti-religious,'' he said. ''We will do everything in the context of dialogue. Everything will be done with an endeavor to reach a common position, but not at the price of paralysis.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 26, 2000, Saturday  A front-page article yesterday about a coalition proposal by Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel referred incorrectly to the history of direct elections for his office. The 1996 election, won by Benjamin Netanyahu, was the first in which Israelis voted directly for prime minister. The election won by Mr. Barak last year was the second.</p>
