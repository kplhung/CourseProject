        <p>The short stay on earth of Charlotte Salomon (1917-1943) didn't draw much notice while it lasted.

        <p>The short stay on earth of Charlotte Salomon (1917-1943) didn't draw much notice while it lasted. A loner crushed by family tragedy and remembered as unmemorable by schoolmates who survived her, she had few friends. And when she and her unborn child died at Auschwitz, oblivion awaited. Yet she defeated it, leaving behind an astonishing work of art that transformed her life into a poignant opera of paintings, words and music.</p>
        <p>Composed from 1940 to 1942, this ''play with music,'' as Salomon called it, came to notice only some years after her death. The work, now owned by the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam, has since been shown in Germany, the Netherlands, France, the United States, Israel and Japan. It has been translated into four languages, made into an impressive book and abridged in several catalogs; it has also served as the subject of several films, as well the inspiration for biographical studies of Salomon.</p>
        <p>Above all, it has earned her a place in the world's memory and once again proves the power of the spirit over earthly horrors.</p>
        <p>The work is made up of nearly 800 small gouaches, Expressionist in style, that cover Salomon's life and times. They are done in a filmic technique with closeups, long shots, montage and flashbacks, carrying the narrative from episode to episode like storyboards. The unbound gouaches are accompanied by a handwritten text that sometimes appears on transparent sheets laid over the paintings and other times on the paintings themselves. And they incorporate cues to the musical themes -- from opera, classical, pop and folk -- that Salomon apparently hummed from memory as she developed her narrative.</p>
        <p>Now more than 400 of the gouaches can be seen again in ''Charlotte Salomon: Life? Or Theater?,'' an exhibition organized by the Royal Academy of Arts in London and on view here at the Museum of Fine Arts. (Some of the texts and musical themes are recorded on an audio guide available to viewers.)</p>
        <p>Accompanying the Salomon work is ''Reflexion,'' an installation by the French artist Christian Boltanski that suggests the ambiguity of visual experience and relates in some ways to Salomon's grand epic.</p>
        <p>The plot of ''Life? Or Theater?,'' like that of most operas, is, to say the least, unwieldy. The narrator, also called Charlotte, presides over a cast of more than 20 characters based on real people but given fictional names. Charlotte and her father, a Berlin surgeon named Albert Salomon, have the surname Kann, meaning able. Her stuffy grandparents, Dr. F. Grunwald and Mrs. M. Benda-Grunwald, become Dr. and Mrs. Knarre, a word for rattle, used here in the sense of an unmusical instrument. To her adored stepmother, Paulina Lindberg, a singer, she gives the name Paulinka Bimbam.</p>
        <p>Her story -- by turns funny, philosophical and visionary, sometimes tiresome and repetitious, but always in a vivid, authentic voice -- is a tragedy touched by moments of intense happiness. It begins with the suicide by drowning of her mother's sister, also named Charlotte, in 1913, four years before the narrator was born. A dark scene painted in deep blues depicts the street where the young woman lived and the nearby lake in which she threw herself.</p>
        <p>Many hundreds of paintings later, ''Life? Or Theater?'' ends with a self-portrait of the narrator facing the sea, back turned to the viewer as she sketches on a transparent easel at the Riviera resort where she joined her grandparents in a futile attempt to escape the Nazis.</p>
        <p>In between, the voluminous saga records important events like the suicide of Charlotte's mother when she was 9 (she was told her mother had died of influenza); her father's remarriage to Paulinka, who became her idol; and the appearance of a hapless, theory-obsessed singing teacher, Amadeus Daberlohn (Alfred Wolfsohn in real life), who falls madly in love with Paulinka but is rejected by her.</p>
        <p>Daberlohn is, after Paulinka, the crucial figure in the narrator's life, and hundreds of pages are devoted to him as he explains his musical theories and tries to convince Paulinka that he can make her a great singer. Meanwhile, he becomes Charlotte's lover. ''May you never forget that I believe in you,'' he tells her before she leaves Germany for a refuge in France.</p>
        <p>The Nazis' rise to power is introduced in the story by an ominous painting of marching troops parading with a swastika banner. (Salomon always inverted the swastika.) The increasingly repressive measures against Jews are chronicled: Dr. Kann can no longer practice medicine except in a Jewish hospital, Paulinka's voice is banned from the Aryan musical world, and Charlotte's school becomes steeped in Nazism. She drops out.</p>
        <p>She succeeds in attending the Berlin Art Academy, where she is the only Jewish student, admitted because her father served as a doctor at the front in World War I. Then, in January 1939, Charlotte leaves Germany for Villefranche, in the south of France, where the Knarres, her grandparents, have taken shelter with an American woman, Otillie Moore, who is identified only in the work's dedication. Moore, who made it her business to assist refugees, particularly children, supported Salomon and bought her paintings.</p>
        <p>From here on, the saga goes steeply downhill. In 1940 a distraught Grandmother Knarre commits suicide, as have her two daughters and several others in her family before her. Charlotte and her grandfather are briefly sent to a concentration camp in the Pyrenees but are allowed to return to Nice. Charlotte moves into a small hotel at St.-Jean-Cap-Ferrat and begins ''Life? Or Theater?''</p>
        <p>The chronicle ends with a prophetic statement: ''And with dream-awakened eyes she saw all the beauty around her, saw the sea, felt the sun, and knew she had to vanish for a while from the human plane and make every sacrifice in order to create her world anew out of the depths.''</p>
        <p>Salomon's life ended this way: Moore departed for America, taking many of her refugee children. Two stayed behind at the villa with an Austrian refugee, Alex Nagler, with whom Moore had had an affair. After her grandfather died, Salomon returned to the villa, a fatal mistake, and shortly thereafter married Nagler. Soon, on Sept. 24, 1943, the couple were picked up by soldiers from SS headquarters at Nice who had found their address on the wedding certificate. They were shipped off to Auschwitz, where the pregnant Salomon was killed on arrival.</p>
        <p>But she had taken the precaution of giving her precious ''play with music'' to Georges Moridis, a local doctor and resistance leader, with the plea: ''Keep this safe. It is my whole life.'' He later gave it to Moore, who returned to her villa in 1946.</p>
        <p>Visited the next year by Salomon's father and stepmother, who had escaped to the Netherlands, Moore grudgingly turned over the work to them while refusing to sell back all but one of Salomon's other paintings in her possession. In 1971 the Salomons gave ''Life? Or Theater?'' to the Jewish Historical Museum.</p>
        <p>Salomon's work can look naive and raw, but she was by no means an outsider artist. She had thorough professional training and came from a deeply cultured family. Her father and stepmother's circle of friends included the architect Erich Mendelsohn; the theologian Albert Schweitzer; Rabbi Leo Baeck, a prominent Jewish leader in Berlin; and Kurt Singer, a psychiatrist, musicologist and director of the Berlin Municipal Opera.</p>
        <p>In her narrative Salomon makes sophisticated allusions to fine art, literature, music and philosophy. Her acquaintance with art history led her to distill the work of many eras and artists -- Michelangelo, Modigliani, Edvard Munch, George Grosz and Marc Chagall, among others -- into her own distinctive style, at times reminiscent of the quirky, very personal work of the American painter Florine Stettheimer. And in analyzing her characters, she produces a telling account of the increasingly repressive milieu of her time.</p>
        <p>''Her description of the pleasures and sufferings, the sophistication and hypocrisy, the dislocations and crudities to be found in this milieu amounts to as convincing an analysis as any of the terrible tragedy that ultimately allowed the Holocaust to take place,'' writes Norman Rosenthal, exhibitions secretary of the Royal Academy, in an article for the 1998 book that serves as the exhibition's catalog.</p>
        <p>In a darkened space next to the galleries that display ''Life? Or Theater?'' Christian Boltanski has hung hundreds of pieces of glass of varying sizes on the walls. Acting as mirrors, they produce images so dim that a viewer is hard put to see his or her own reflection. Placed upright on the floor are nine metal frames displaying archival images of anonymous faces (actually victims and perpetrators from old newspaper crime clippings), photographed on translucent fabric. An audio component, using excerpts from random memories recorded by students who helped set up the exhibition, adds to the ethereal effect.</p>
        <p>The installation, which, in juxtaposition with ''Life? Or Theater?'' suggests the terrible anonymity the Nazis conferred on their victims, is a haunting, although very different, experience.</p>
        <p>''Charlotte Salomon: Life? Or Theater?'' is on view through Oct. 29 and ''Christian Boltanski: Reflexion'' through Nov. 12 at the Museum of Fine Arts, 465 Huntington Avenue, Boston, (617) 267-9300.</p>
