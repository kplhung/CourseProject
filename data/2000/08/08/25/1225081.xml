        <p>After gazing for a while at the super super super computer that is the dominant prop in ''Imperfect Chemistry'' at the Minetta Lane Theater, it seems only natural to wonder how much better the results might have been had it written and composed this new musical.</p>
        <p>''Imperfect Chemistry,'' which opened last night, is a thoughtful, updated but less than inspired version of the Genesis story in which the cast outshines the material, and the director, John Ruocco, who is also the choreographer, makes the most of it.</p>
        <p>With story and music by Albert Tapper and book and lyrics by James Racheff, ''Imperfect Chemistry'' tells the Adam and Eve tale of two newly minted Ph.D.'s in genetics, Alvin Rivers (Ken Barnett) and Elizabeth Gibbs (Amanda Watkins), who arrive in a scientific paradise called Avalon. The golf-obsessed Dr. Goodman (John Jellison), who runs the place, grants them free will to pursue whatever research they choose and asks only that they never, ever use his giant computer.</p>
        <p>Grappling with the question of what to do with their freedom and, of course, beginning to fall in love, Alvin and Elizabeth run afoul of Avalon's slimy administrator, Harry Lizzarde (Brooks Ashmanskas), who is in thrall to the spade-bearded, evil, fearsome former gulag resident Dr. Bubinski (Mr. Jellison once again).</p>
        <p>What Bubinski covets most is money, and with the connivance of Lizzarde the two young scientists are soon at work on a surefire remedy for baldness. But the experimental phase will consume four or five years, and Lizzarde, under threat of death from Bubinski, cannot wait. So he induces Alvin and Elizabeth to sneak in and use Dr. Goodman's forbidden computer.</p>
        <p>Although Alvin and Elizabeth achieve their goal, Dr. Goodman expels them from Avalon. When next seen they are wealthy and unhappy, while Bubinski and the ever more hirsute Lizzarde are wealthy and giddy. After all, just about everyone in the world, women included, is buying and using the new Loxagene.</p>
        <p>What Alvin and Elizabeth (and the omniscient Dr. Goodman) know is that Loxagene has an unfortunate side effect: unless dosage is halted, everyone in the world will regress to Neanderthalism en route to extinction. This is news that Bubinski is not about to share.</p>
        <p>So as the humanity regresses around them, Alvin and Elizabeth, who have never taken Loxagene, teach themselves to pilot a plane and fly off to God knows where.</p>
        <p>As vehicles go in musical theater, ''Imperfect Chemistry'' is laden with a heavy cargo of issues about creation, evolution, genetic experimentation and the frailties of human nature, though its book seems content with flashing a caution light while dealing more comfortably with young love.</p>
        <p>The show's efforts at humor are usually obvious and far from side-splitting, and much too much time and effort, including a sprightly song titled ''St. Andrews,'' are lavished on Dr. Goodman's penchant for golf. The lyrics and music have their bright spots, but as a whole they fail to inject ''Imperfect Chemistry'' with consistent charm.</p>
        <p>The cast, however, merits praise, as do Rob Odorisio, who did the scenery, and Curtis Hay, responsible for the costumes. Mr. Jellison has a high time working both ends of the Miltonic spectrum as Goodman and Bubinski. Ms. Watkins, behind her black-rimmed spectacles and scientific expertise, simmers with sensuality as Elizabeth, and Mr. Barnett makes Alvin an appealing nerd. To the role of Lizzarde, Mr. Ashmanskas brings welcome touches of Robert Morse, Gene Wilder and even Bruce Willis.</p>
        <p>But ''Imperfect Chemistry,'' while reworking an old story, remains an imperfect musical.</p>
