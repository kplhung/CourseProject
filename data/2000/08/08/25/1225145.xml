        <p>The Mets may or may not have begun watching the scoreboard. After this weekend, they might not need to.</p>
        <p>Sometime after pitching the Mets to a 4-1 victory in San Diego on Wednesday, working eight strong innings on a night when the Mets had only two relievers available, Al Leiter noticed that Milwaukee had beaten the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Mets' main competitor for the National League wild card, completing a three-game sweep in Phoenix.</p>
        <p>''Everybody was all excited that they lost,'' said Leiter, who at 14-5 may be having the best season of any National League pitcher except for Arizona's Randy Johnson. ''As we get into September, I think that's when scoreboard-watching gets fun. It's still a little soon. I'm not really sure when it becomes important.''</p>
        <p>The Mets have a chance to make their September scoreboard-watching relaxing, not tense, when they play the Diamondbacks at Shea Stadium in a three-game series starting tonight. With a four-and-a-half-game lead over Arizona and no other teams seriously challenging for the wild card, the Mets could fluff their cushion with a repeat of their May sweep at Shea.</p>
        <p>Johnson faces the Mets tonight, but he hasn't won in his last three starts against them, including the opener of last year's division series, and he has a 6.75 earned run average in those games.</p>
        <p>But if the Mets are thinking sweep this weekend, they are not saying.</p>
        <p>''This was the first series we haven't won in a while,'' catcher Mike Piazza said after Wednesday's decision gave the Mets their only victory in a three-game series with the Padres. ''So we'll try to win the first game, then win the series. That approach has been working for us. Just play good baseball and not turn this into a playoff series or anything.''</p>
        <p>Like last year, the Mets are fighting a two-front battle to reach the postseason: against the Diamondbacks (or San Francisco Giants, if Arizona overtakes them in the National League West) for the wild card, and the Atlanta Braves for the National League East title. The latter is the primary goal. ''As it stands right now, to settle for anything but the best we can is not a good thought,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said.</p>
        <p>The Mets play the Braves six times in late September. Last season, their late games against Atlanta became a series of trap doors. Each time they fell, they slipped farther behind, and they had to claw back to make the playoffs after a seven-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>This year, the Braves have won four of seven games with the Mets after beating them in the National League Championship Series last fall. But the Mets have proved something to themselves.</p>
        <p>''There hasn't been a lot of talk about it in here, but I think everyone understands that the road to the World Series is through Atlanta,'' outfielder Darryl Hamilton said. ''There's no mystery to that. They're going to be there. But we're not concentrating on that until we face them. We can't look at the calendar and say, 'We'll do this, and then we'll be close.' ''</p>
        <p>What the Mets can do, Hamilton said, is look at last year's collapse-turned-comeback to convince themselves they can handle the pennant push. ''After what happened to us the last week of the season, guys have the mind-set that nothing is impossible,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After 127 games last year, the Mets were 77-50 and trailed Atlanta by a game and a half. This year, they are 75-52, two and a half games back. The biggest difference with this year's Mets, Leiter said, is how they view the Braves.</p>
        <p>''It's simple,'' he said. ''The invincibility factor we felt with the Braves is no longer there, or isn't as prevalent or obvious, because of what we did as a group, collectively, in that N.L.C.S. Also this year, so far I think they're up one game on us, but at least we've won a couple. And that goes a long way.''</p>
        <p>Further, Leiter said, the new players on this year's team have performed well. Valentine would not compare this year's team to last year's, but General Manager Steve Phillips pointed to two areas in which he feels this group is stronger.</p>
        <p>''I think we're probably better this year,'' Phillips said. ''We're deeper with our pitching than we were a year ago. Our bench is probably a little stronger this year than it was a year ago.</p>
        <p>''One thing we don't have is that real base-stealing threat to come in, but just about every other situation -- when we need a guy to hit a ball out of the park, bunt, walk -- we have those guys.''</p>
        <p>The pitching staff is deep, with the starter Bobby J. Jones pitching well and the reliever Rick White a solid addition. The relievers Dennis Cook and Pat Mahomes have been inconsistent and the starter Glendon Rusch has struggled at times, but John Franco and Armando Benitez have been dominant for two months.</p>
        <p>The bigger question may be right fielder Derek Bell. He has five hits in his last 50 at-bats since his dramatic home run at Houston on Aug. 7, and his average has tumbled to .278, its lowest point since April 15.</p>
        <p>If Bell continues to slump, the Mets could give Hamilton more time in right field.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Mets second baseman EDGARDO ALFONZO hopes to start tonight after having missed his second game in a row Wednesday, bothered by a stiff neck. . . . MIKE HAMPTON will throw in the bullpen today and could start on Sunday. If he does, the Mets will simply bump back the rest of their rotation to give each starter an extra day of rest.</p>
