        <p>The E*Trade Goup, the online brokerage firm in Menlo Park, Calif., is scooping up another Internet start-up. This time it is PrivateAccounts.com, a Minneapolis-based venture that planned to connect individual investors with well-known money managers. E*Trade did not disclose what it was paying for PrivateAccounts.com, which has not even opened for business. Later this year, E*Trade plans to start charging fees to customers with $100,000 or more that they want managed for them, said Liat Rorer, an E*Trade vice president. Ms. Rorer declined to say whom the managers would be or what the cost would be. E*Trade also just bought the Electronic Investing Corporation, a San Francisco-based start-up that had planned to offer online trading of baskets of stocks. Through these acquisitions, the brokerage firm hopes to broaden its product line and become less dependent on commissions from stock trades.</p>
