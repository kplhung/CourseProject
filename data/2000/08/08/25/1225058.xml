        <p>EYEWITNESS TO POWER  The Essence of Leadership,  Nixon to Clinton  By David Gergen  382 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $26.</p>
        <p>In his new book on presidential leadership, the veteran White House adviser David Gergen laments the current state of politics, the ascendance of spin and media manipulation and the tendency of politicians like Bill Clinton to mistake campaigning for governance. ''The 1980 contest for the White House was the last truly good one the country has had,'' he writes, ''because all three candidates -- Carter, Anderson and Reagan -- provided clear choices for the electorate. They said exactly what courses they intended to pursue if elected, didn't blur their differences, held down the mud slinging, and didn't sell their souls to their pollsters and handlers.''</p>
        <p>The problem is that Mr. Gergen himself is one of the people who helped create this sorry state of affairs; he has effectively made a career out of playing the role of the little man behind the curtain in ''The Wizard of Oz,'' helping to orchestrate the auras of the great and powerful. It was Mr. Gergen who helped institute ''spin patrol'' during the Reagan years, using his mastery of leaking, damage control and sound bites to package and promote that administration's policies. And it was Mr. Gergen who was later enlisted by an embattled Clinton White House -- which had reviled many of Mr. Reagan's conservative stands -- to help shore up its operations and public image.</p>

        <p>EYEWITNESS TO POWER  The Essence of Leadership,  Nixon to Clinton  By David Gergen  382 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $26.</p>
        <p>In his new book on presidential leadership, the veteran White House adviser David Gergen laments the current state of politics, the ascendance of spin and media manipulation and the tendency of politicians like Bill Clinton to mistake campaigning for governance. ''The 1980 contest for the White House was the last truly good one the country has had,'' he writes, ''because all three candidates -- Carter, Anderson and Reagan -- provided clear choices for the electorate. They said exactly what courses they intended to pursue if elected, didn't blur their differences, held down the mud slinging, and didn't sell their souls to their pollsters and handlers.''</p>
        <p>The problem is that Mr. Gergen himself is one of the people who helped create this sorry state of affairs; he has effectively made a career out of playing the role of the little man behind the curtain in ''The Wizard of Oz,'' helping to orchestrate the auras of the great and powerful. It was Mr. Gergen who helped institute ''spin patrol'' during the Reagan years, using his mastery of leaking, damage control and sound bites to package and promote that administration's policies. And it was Mr. Gergen who was later enlisted by an embattled Clinton White House -- which had reviled many of Mr. Reagan's conservative stands -- to help shore up its operations and public image.</p>
        <p>In many respects, Mr. Gergen's easy transit from being a Republican helpmate to being a Democratic one, from being a White House spinmeister to being a journalistic one (he is currently editor-at-large for U.S. News &amp; World Report and a regular analyst on ''The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'') underscores the pragmatic -- some would say mercenary -- ethos of a political era that increasingly values expertise over conviction, style over substance. Mr. Gergen's description of himself as a ''pro-choice, high safety net man''  did not keep him from working for Ronald Reagan, just as his ''hard-line'' views in international affairs  did not keep him from working for Bill Clinton.</p>
        <p>In ''Eyewitness to Power'' Mr. Gergen tries to spin his own image, repudiating the consequences of the very processes he helped set in motion. ''How could we have taught a younger generation of public officials the wrong lessons about governance?'' he asks. ''Where had we gone wrong? While officials since the beginning of the republic have been cajoling the press, one of my deepest regrets in public life is a feeling that I have contributed to this deterioration. Spin has spun out of control and we need to put it back in its box.''</p>
        <p>In much the same way that his former Reagan colleague James A. Baker 3rd tried in his memoirs (''The Politics of Diplomacy'') to put his reputation as ''The Velvet Hammer'' behind him and reinvent himself as a statesman, so Mr. Gergen tries in this volume to put his reputation as ''The Sieve'' behind him and reinvent himself as a Washington wise man. ''Eyewitness,'' which recounts Mr. Gergen's experiences working with Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, is at once a hypocritical mea culpa and a series of talking points designed to insure the author's reputation as the insider's insider.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Gergen's public persona, familiar to readers from his many television appearances as both a pundit and a White House spokesman, this book is low-key and conciliatory in tone, almost every criticism balanced with a compliment. President Clinton, whose service Mr. Gergen left after 18 months, feeling ''angry'' and ''used,'' receives the harshest treatment; he is repeatedly criticized for his lack of self-control, his poor management style and his reliance on his wife as a political partner.</p>
        <p>Occasionally a faint whiff of ''I told you so'' creeps into the book's pages. Had President Ford put a strong chief of staff in place from the start as Mr. Gergen wished, it is suggested, his administration might have avoided many of its early and debilitating stumbles. Had President Clinton listened to Mr. Gergen and others who advised him to make a full disclosure of Whitewater documents from the start, ''we would have punctured the growing pressure for an independent counsel'' and the whole ensuing melodrama with Kenneth Starr and Monica Lewinsky might well have been avoided.</p>
        <p>Drawing heavily on Mr. Gergen's own reminiscences -- as well as such works on leadership as Garry Wills's ''Certain Trumpets'' and Howard Gardner's ''Leading Minds'' -- ''Eyewitness to Power'' sifts through the record of recent administrations to give future would-be Presidents some tips on how to be an effective leader. Though Mr. Gergen's analysis of individual Presidents is often shrewd, many of his tips are little more than the sort of common-sense recommendations one might find in a self-help book: i.e., ''leadership starts from within,'' or surround yourself with ''strong, prudent advisers.''</p>
        <p>Other observations will be self-evident to anyone familiar with recent history. Mr. Gergen points out that the Nixon White House went too far in ''trying to manage the news''  and that President Clinton shared Nixon's intelligence, obsession with spinning, tendency to polarize and compulsive need to win.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Gergen's opinion, President Clinton's failure to take control of the health care initiative was connected to his unwillingness to challenge Hillary Rodham Clinton in the wake of reports alleging that he had used Arkansas state troopers to procure women. ''Might we have passed a bipartisan reform plan,'' Mr. Gergen asks, if the shadow of Bill Clinton's past ''had not hung over his relationship with his wife?''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Gergen frequently mentions the importance of character and goals in this volume, most of his advice revolves around strategy and stagecraft and the best way to play the game. The focus tends to be on presentation and perception, not morality or vision. For instance, in the case of President Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon, Mr. Gergen writes, ''it was in the execution of his decision -- not the decision itself -- that the new president stumbled.'' Instead of simply springing the pardon on an unsuspecting country, he argues, Mr. Ford should have carefully laid the proper groundwork first.</p>
        <p>In ''Eyewitness to Power'' Mr. Gergen also devotes a large amount of space to drawing lessons in communication from President Reagan's speeches: keep it short and brisk, he advises, ''use the language of the living room,'' ''look for catchy facts,'' ''use the occasional prop,'' ''be positive,'' ''anticipate the critics'' and ''have a good closer.'' Mr. Gergen argues that historical allusions can lend a leader ''an aura of distinction,'' and he emphasizes the importance, in the first 100 days, of establishing a positive narrative in the public's mind.</p>
        <p>''There is nothing more important to the success of an actor, it is said, than his performance in his first scene and in his last,'' Mr. Gergen writes. ''One shapes his character for the entire play, the other the memories that the audience carries from the theater. The same applies in politics and in other fields of leadership.''</p>
        <p>The analogy between actors and politicians is no accident: in the spin-driven world Mr. Gergen has helped create, the line between the two has become increasingly blurry, with handlers like himself cast in the ever more visible role of director.</p>
