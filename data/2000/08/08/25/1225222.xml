        <p>Sheryl Swoopes raised her hand disdainfully, muttered at the referee and arched an eyebrow as she walked to the bench.</p>
        <p>With 3 minutes 46 seconds left in the first game of the Women's National Basketball Association finals  between the Liberty and Houston, the flustered Comets star had just been called for an offensive foul that gave the Liberty a chance to pull to within 2 points for the first time since trailing by 4-2 in the first half.</p>
        <p>Tari Phillips did a fake for a clear shot, but then missed. Crystal Robinson saved the rebound, only to watch it float off the tips of Phillips's fingers into the crowd.</p>
        <p>It was one of many blown opportunities on a frustrating night for the Liberty, which fell, 59-52, at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the Liberty players shook their heads as they pointed to moment after moment that could have changed the outcome.</p>
        <p>''When I drove and faked, then Crystal got the rebound, that could have been the turning point,'' Phillips said afterward. ''We couldn't make key shots. At times we were not aggressive enough. Whenever you make mistakes, they make you pay for them.''</p>
        <p>With 52.3 seconds left, the Liberty cut the deficit to 2 when Teresa Weatherspoon sank two free throws. But New York handed the game right back when Sue Wicks fouled Cynthia Cooper, who banked in the layup. Cooper hit the foul shot en route to a team-high 20 points.</p>
        <p>It was the kind of crucial shot that the Liberty missed all night, spoiling a defensive effort that forced the Comets into 35.5 percent shooting.</p>
        <p>The Liberty shot 32.1 percent.</p>
        <p>''I thought we fought them tooth and nail the whole game,'' the Liberty coach, Richie Adubato, said. ''We just came up short on some clutch baskets when we needed them.''</p>
        <p>In the locker room, the Liberty players tried to explain the absence of a killer instinct after claiming all week that confidence was the difference between this year's team and the one that lost in the finals to Houston last year.</p>
        <p>Becky Hammon, who shot 1 for 5, scoring 4 points, slumped on the seat in her locker, her arms folded as she stared at nothing. Tamika Whitmore, who shot 1 for 11 with 4 rebounds, was nowhere to be found.</p>
        <p>Phillips, whose spectacular 24 points and 15 rebounds were the bright spot for the Liberty, tried to explain what had gone wrong.</p>
        <p>''We were in control,'' Phillips said. ''But we made mistakes and gave them an edge.''</p>
        <p>Hammon said: ''It was more ourselves than anything. We had open shots and we didn't hit them. I'm very mad, very upset. We didn't play well.''</p>
        <p>Neither did the Comets. The teams fared similarly in many statistical categories, including in turnovers (the Liberty and Houston had 12 apiece) and in steals (the Comets had 8 and the Liberty had 7).</p>
        <p>Though the statistical differences were slight, Cooper's key shot in the final seconds indicated teams that are worlds apart. It was the fifth straight playoff victory for the three-time defending champion Comets, who can win another title tomorrow in Houston, where they have lost only 11 games in 4 years.</p>
        <p>''We just got to go do the impossible,'' Weatherspoon said. ''The impossible is what everyone thinks. We think it's possible.''</p>
