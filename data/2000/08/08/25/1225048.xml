        <p>A mildly amusing Japanese appropriation of 1950's American detective movies, ''The Most Terrible Time in My Life'' relates the life and crimes of a Yokohama private dick named Maiku Hama. Say it fast four or five times and the hidden reference to Mickey Spillane's notably brutal character Mike Hammer grandly emerges.</p>
        <p>Hama is played by Masatoshi Nagase, the dyspeptic, terminally bored-looking young man Jim Jarmusch recruited to play a lethargic Japanese tourist in his 1989 ''Mystery Train.'' At first, it's surprising to see how little Mr. Nagase appears to have aged in 11 years. It turns out that ''The Most Terrible Time,'' which opens today at the Screening Room, was actually made in 1993 and has since been patiently awaiting American distribution.</p>

        <p>A mildly amusing Japanese appropriation of 1950's American detective movies, ''The Most Terrible Time in My Life'' relates the life and crimes of a Yokohama private dick named Maiku Hama. Say it fast four or five times and the hidden reference to Mickey Spillane's notably brutal character Mike Hammer grandly emerges.</p>
        <p>Hama is played by Masatoshi Nagase, the dyspeptic, terminally bored-looking young man Jim Jarmusch recruited to play a lethargic Japanese tourist in his 1989 ''Mystery Train.'' At first, it's surprising to see how little Mr. Nagase appears to have aged in 11 years. It turns out that ''The Most Terrible Time,'' which opens today at the Screening Room, was actually made in 1993 and has since been patiently awaiting American distribution.</p>
        <p>For its part, America has probably not been awaiting ''The Most Terrible Time in My Life,'' patiently or otherwise, since this nation is fully capable of producing mildly amusing detective spoofs all on its own. The director, Kaizo Hayashi, incorporates the references, standard since Jean-Luc Godard's ''Breathless,'' to the Bogart myth and the gangster films of the big-hat, pin-stripe suit era. But where Mr. Godard was revealing the unstable existential underpinnings of the Bogart legend, Mr. Hayashi offers a far more naive, romantic version of the material. It often feels like little children playing dress-up, and indeed the film was said to have started a fad for private detective gear among Japanese teenagers when it was released.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nagase does look sharp in his pork pie hat and sunglasses, particularly when he hops behind the wheel of his lustrously polished 1954 convertible. Maiku Hama keeps his office in a heavily symbolic location, just off the upper balcony of a run-down neighborhood movie theater where ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' is playing to small groups of Yokohama film buffs. (The Japanese characters on the marquee flip over to reveal the title of Mr. Hayashi's film.) But his work comes to him in the storefront gambling parlor where he spends his lunch hour.</p>
        <p>He rescues a Taiwanese busboy from a savage beating by local yakuza thugs, losing his little finger in the process. When the busboy, Yang Haitin (the actor uses his own name in the part), wants to reward Hama for his efforts, he offers to pay him to find his brother, De Jian (Hou De Jian), who has disappeared into the Japanese underworld and taken on a Japanese name.</p>
        <p>The film finds its only resonance here, in the theme of mainland immigration and the prejudice that Korean immigrants in particular experience in Japan. (Mr. Hayashi was born to Korean parents in Kyoto.) The brother is actually a big-time hood who is organizing a group of fellow newcomers into a brutal new gang, which he calls the New Japs; it's a development that adds a deepening darkness and violence to the film's final reels.</p>
        <p>But this is a film more about look and attitude than about social issues. Its outstanding feature is the soft-edged, black-and-white wide-screen images contributed by Yuichi Nagata. They almost perfectly recapture the look of Japanese underworld films of the 1950's and 60's, like Mikio Naruse's ''When a Woman Ascends the Stairs'' and Akira Kurosawa's ''High and Low.''</p>
        <p>''The Most Terrible Time in My Life'' was a hit in its home country and inspired two sequels, one of which, the garishly colored ''Stairway to the Distant Past,'' is given a preview at the end of this film. More patient waiting appears to be in store.</p>
