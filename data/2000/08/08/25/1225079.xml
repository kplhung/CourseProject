        <p>NICK BOBOTIS came to see the Lexus IS 300, but while he was at it, took a test drive in the Acura 3.2TL and the Infiniti I30, something he could never do at a single dealership; nearby, keys in the ignition, sat an Audi A4, a BMW 320i, a Chrysler 300M and a Lincoln LS -- names that constitute much of the roll call of midsize, upscale sedans.</p>
        <p>''There's no pressure, and you can compare side by side,'' said Mr. Bobotis, of Alexandria, Va., marveling at this new way to shop for cars as he completed a turn around a half-mile test track that included a straightaway with a digital timer, a slalom and a simulation of broken pavement.</p>
        <p>Nearby, in a tent big enough for a three-ring circus, in a different section of this unusual auto marketing effort, another shopper, Mustafa Ozdemir, watched, fascinated, as a woman he might have mistaken for a salesperson demonstrated the three-way seat in the rear of a new minivan. The seat could be positioned for third-row passengers, or folded flat into a footwell, or flipped over so that it faced the rear, providing a comfortable seating area for a tailgate party if you didn't mind your feet hanging out of the back of the car.</p>
        <p>''This one is the Honda, but the Mazda has it, too,'' said the woman, demonstrating that unlike most sales personnel, she had no desire to push one model over the other. ''And the 2001 Pontiac will have it,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bobotis and Mr. Ozdemir were among 2,000 licensed drivers who shopped in the first weekend of August at an event so different that it doesn't have a generic name yet. What it was, was a multibrand car show and test-driving venue. And it was sponsored by a company that does not sell cars.</p>
        <p>The event was the second of six being put on around the nation by Edmunds, a publisher of automotive books that has mostly transformed itself into an Internet company, Edmunds.com. The Edmunds Web site provides comparative information on a variety of cars. The company said the event here, which it called EdmundsLive, was a real-world version of the Web site.</p>
        <p>But under the tent there was also a circle of 24 computers, with Edmunds.com as the home page, that visitors could use to look up information on cars. Among the information on the Web site -- and posted near the cars in the tent -- was what Edmunds calls true market value, which is the company's estimate, based on mathematical models and current supply and demand, of what a consumer could reasonably expect to pay for any model of car. It also lists the manufacturers' suggested retail price as well as the invoice, which is the basis for what dealers pay for the cars on their lots.</p>
        <p>Edmunds says the site -- like the tour events -- lets customers go to a dealer with choices already narrowed down, possibly to a single vehicle, and with a price in mind that will reduce haggling and the feeling that one may have made a bad deal.</p>
        <p>''It's up to the consumer who they want to go to to buy, if they go at all,'' said Jeremy P. Anwyl, the chief operating officer. Most people would end up going to a traditional dealership, company officials said, but Mr. Anwyl said, they would ''leave here more convinced they're going to buy.''</p>
        <p>General Motors dealers in California have sometimes held similar events on their own, featuring the company's cars. And G.M. did something similar two years ago, in the same parking lot here, outside the stadium where the Redskins play football. That show covered a wider band of the market, with cars, pickups and sport utilities, and likewise had no pressure to buy immediately, but its object was to sell G.M. models.</p>
        <p>The Edmunds event, part of a six-city tour that began in Atlanta and will be repeated at Raceway Park in Englishtown, N.J., Thursday through Sunday, Sept. 3, includes 132 total cars representing more than 50 models.</p>
        <p>ADMISSION is $15 for each adult 18 and over, a price that does not come close to covering costs, company officials say. Whatever profit Edmunds makes comes from the commissions it is paid by four sponsors with booths in the tent: CarsDirect.com, which lets consumers order cars over the Internet; eCoverage, which sells insurance online; PeopleFirst.com, an online lender; and 1SourceAutoWarranty.com, which sells extended warranties on the Web. But Edmunds has no financial interest in the preferences of shoppers, said Avi Steinlauf, the marketing director. ''We're not in anybody's pocket,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That was clear in the minivan area, where a shopper climbed into a Ford Windstar. ''It's a little noisier than the others,'' said Bob Featherly, who was escorting shoppers to cars and answering questions. ''But it's got very nice doors,'' he said, pushing a button that activated one of the motorized sliding doors.</p>
        <p>The most dramatic scene was at the sport utility vehicle test track. Several truckloads of dirt had been brought in to create the illusion of an off-road track, including ''blue sky hill,'' a mound so steep that nothing except the sky was visible through the windshield of a Ford Expedition as it was driven over the obstacle.</p>
        <p>Jeannine Fallon, an Edmunds spokeswoman, said surveys collected from visitors as they left the Atlanta stop indicated that two-thirds planned to buy a car in the near future. The others, she said, ''saw it as some sort of amusement park, and they were happy to pay the 15 bucks.'' Mr. Steinlauf, the marketing director, said people were spending four to five hours at the event, even coming back for a second day; Edmunds had expected shoppers to stay an average of 90 minutes.</p>
        <p>In fact, all the visitors to the show here seemed to like the idea of a no-pressure arena for comparison shopping. ''You can really look at the cars, without somebody in the background eyeing you as if you're their next commission,'' said Judy Fiery, who came with her husband, Sam, from Hagerstown, Md., about an hour and a half by car, to spend a day of their vacation at the show.</p>
        <p>The Fierys' daughter had just graduated from Frostburg State University, near Hagerstown, and their graduation gift was going to be a down payment on a Jetta; meanwhile, Mr. Fiery was looking over what might replace their 1989 Mercury Sable, with 115,000 miles, in a year or two. Now that their daughter had graduated -- and ''the Bank of Mom and Dad is finally closed,'' as Mr. Fiery put it -- he had his eye on the LS or the 300M. But Mr. Fiery, who works in a Mack Truck engine assembly plant, was also just enjoying the show.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bobotis, the shopper who had come to see the Lexus, was, too. ''What I can't stand at an auto show is that you can't even adjust the seat and see if you can get comfortable, because the electrical system has been turned off,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bobotis, who drives a 1993 Mustang that ''has another year in it, maybe,'' also liked the side-by-side comparison. In 1987, he said, he had worked for six months as a salesman in a Ford dealership in Waldorf, Md., and one day a customer whom he was accompanying on a test drive pulled into the lot of a Volkswagen dealer, to try out a competitor's model. ''I'm thinking, 'The nerve of this guy,' '' said Mr. Bobotis. ''But he was pretty smart.''</p>
        <p>The ride-and-drives here were not perfect; some shoppers complained that on the courses, which were up to five-eighths of a mile long, they could not test the vehicles at highway speed. On the other hand, few dealers would park a test-drive model at the head of an obstacle course of traffic cones and invite the shopper to make the tires squeal.</p>
