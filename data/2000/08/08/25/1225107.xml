        <p>Responding to the public outcry over soaring electricity bills, State Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer asked state regulators yesterday to require Consolidated Edison to roll back its rates to last year's levels and called for a re-evaluation of the state's fledgling energy deregulation program.</p>
        <p>In a petition filed with the State Public Service Commission, the agency that regulates utilities, Mr. Spitzer also said that Con Ed should no longer be permitted to pass along to consumers the increased cost of buying power on the wholesale market. ''Con Ed's ability to do so cannot be squared with the deregulatory environment in which the company is supposed to be operating,'' the petition said.</p>

        <p>Responding to the public outcry over soaring electricity bills, State Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer asked state regulators yesterday to require Consolidated Edison to roll back its rates to last year's levels and called for a re-evaluation of the state's fledgling energy deregulation program.</p>
        <p>In a petition filed with the State Public Service Commission, the agency that regulates utilities, Mr. Spitzer also said that Con Ed should no longer be permitted to pass along to consumers the increased cost of buying power on the wholesale market. ''Con Ed's ability to do so cannot be squared with the deregulatory environment in which the company is supposed to be operating,'' the petition said.</p>
        <p>Maureen O. Helmer, the chairwoman of the commission, issued a statement calling the petition ''shocking'' because Mr. Spitzer had been involved in discussions with the agency over Con Ed's rates.</p>
        <p>''P.S.C. action in the Con Ed case will not be a response to anyone's political grandstanding,'' the statement said. ''It would be nonsensical for us to address his petition prior to the conclusion of the current proceeding to which he is already a party.''</p>
        <p>Con Ed officials issued a statement denying responsibility for the higher bills. ''As far as we can tell,'' the statement said, ''the only beneficiaries of rising electrical costs have been the oil companies, the power generators and government by virtue of a tax windfall.''</p>
        <p>Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for the utility, said that asking Con Ed to absorb the higher costs of electricity that private operators are charging ''does not make sense by any business standard.''</p>
        <p>Under the state's deregulation program, the public can choose among various private, unregulated electricity suppliers, but most Con Ed customers have continued to buy power from the utility. Average bills for Con Ed's 3.1 million customers in New York City and Westchester County increased by 43 percent last month over the same month last summer, even though temperatures were much cooler last month. The increase raised questions over whether Con Ed was fulfilling its legal obligation to charge ''just and reasonable'' rates, the petition said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer said in a telephone interview that the restructuring was not working, but he stopped short of characterizing deregulation itself as a failure. ''We have not given deregulation a shot,'' he said. ''The structure they have put in place is a failure.''</p>
        <p>He said that if the commission did not prevent Con Ed from passing on the higher costs of electricity to consumers, he would seek legislation to accomplish the same thing. In the past, Gov. George E. Pataki has said that deregulation was an administrative matter, not a task for the Legislature. But Mr. Spitzer said the climate was changing.</p>
        <p>''The pressure on the Legislature to respond is very powerful,'' he said.</p>
