        <p>A 17th-century poet said that God made the first garden and the first city. But as it turned out, humans gave up the garden and were never quite so happy again. Eventually they moved to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>By that time cities had a bad rap. Shelley thought hell was a city rather like London. Not long after he said so, photography came along and tried to save the sinking reputation of the urban environment. Until late in the 19th century, when social reform became a big issue, urban photography came mainly to praise rather than to bury, and there was quite a lot of it around, pronouncing black and white eulogies.</p>
        <p>Goodness knows Manhattan has been photographed ad infinitum and ad nauseam, from its towering buildings to its cowering homeless, its intemperate subways to its decorous penthouses, Miss Liberty to the residents at Rikers. It's still going on.  Tourists are focusing on the Disney and Warner Brothers stores, professionals on everything else.</p>
        <p>Everything. If you want to know how far afield a serious photographer will go in this city, you can get some idea at the Museum of the City of New York, where ''New York Now 2000: Contemporary Work in Photography'' offers 130 photographs of New York City and New Yorkers, taken by 41 photographers. The exhibition was selected by Bob Shamis, curator of prints and photographs, with the assistance of an advisory board, and is the initial presentation of a new program ''embracing cutting-edge approaches to creatively interpreting the distinctive urban experience of the City,'' according to the museum.</p>
        <p>Distinctively urban these photographs are, cutting-edge maybe. They are more about cities than about ''the City,'' more about photography than either. Wherever cities grow, architectural geometries, ethnic types and rushing citizens like those on view here will pop up. They may not be as bleached and blurred and oddly cut off as those in the wide range of approaches in this show, which includes photographs of collaged engravings, scenes constructed with photographs of collaged engravings, scenes constructed with mannequins, daguerreotypes and stereographs.</p>
        <p>A nice clutch of good pictures stands out here between the usual numbers of boring ones, and a surprisingly large complement of relatively unknown photographers is a bonus. Though the artistic and experimental work here generally outclasses the documentary, old-fashioned straight photography still delivers the old-fashioned goods: Stanley Greenberg's film-noir image of a city tunnel; Andrew Moore's morose interiors of old theaters; Jim Dow's opulent color image of the University Club library; Mitch Epstein's color photograph of two adults and two children, dwarfed and made pale by an enormous, black and white billboard of a man reclining in his Calvin Klein skivvies. Even that image, advertising being what it is, might turn up someplace other than the glitzy, grungy, overripe Big Apple.</p>
        <p>New York is a problem (in more ways than one). So many photographers have gotten drunk on this city's high-proof distillation of urban experience that the subject ought to have been used up long ago. But  there are no used-up subjects (though some are tired and some have become icons, and daunting);  there are only subjects that require rethinking and inventiveness.</p>
        <p>A few adventurous souls run clever riffs on the trite and true. Thanks to Abelardo Morell's camera obscura, the upper part of the Empire State Building and its spire lie upside down in a graceful diagonal across a bed, while a broad swath of the city's skyline hangs down from the top of the bedroom. Susan Wides even manages to see the Flatiron Building with a fresh eye by paying off-kilter homage to Stieglitz and Steichen. Both of them photographed, memorably, the building's majestic triangular prow seen through a bare-branched tree.  Wides represents the Flatiron in strict and nearly rectangular profile, in color, tilting crazily above a scraggly clump of trees.</p>
        <p>And one photographer, Katharina Bosse, finds a subject that will be new to most people, if perhaps not unique to this city: rooms rented to those who want to live out their sexual fantasies. One is an operating room, entirely icy blue with rubber head masks and an enema bag, and one a luxurious boudoir that the renters presumably could not afford on their own.</p>
        <p>Many of the photographers close in on details that might be anywhere outside a rain forest, or liberally court blur that effectively erases identity, or fiddle with the print till the color wavers or the image swoons. Some of these photographs are fine: Sophie Rivera's sharply composed, gritty viaduct painters;  Don Burmeister's pillars and sky in saturated oranges and turquoise;  James Fee's indistinct image of a blimp in a sky so full of photographic imperfections it looks like the end of the world; Vera Lutter's otherworldly camera obscura negative of a Pepsi sign; Maria Theresia Lit schauer's decaying buildings amid wrenchingly red skies and rivers.</p>
        <p>These are urban all right -- not a hay wain in sight -- but they don't look a lot like the New York or even the urban experience that most people meet on the sidewalks. These and other photographers in the show --  worried that New York has been done to death, worried that photography has been done to death, threatened by computers and impugned by philosophical types -- play around with techniques, unusual composition and presentation in a dogged effort to ''make it new.'' Some have photographic subjects, some have photographic pretexts -- in this case both of these are in New York -- and some are more interested in what they can do to change, extend, disguise or radicalize the medium. New York being close at hand, their cameras blink at it.</p>
        <p>Photography has always had the dual ability to present an equivalent to everyday experience or a camera experience that isn't ordinarily encountered without a camera. Equivalents are the images that make you think, ''Yes, that's the way it is.'' A camera experience, still dependent on what light, a lens and film or electronic impulses deliver, is another way to look at the familiar, a magnified detail, say, that no human eyes could see in rectangular format, or an action stopped faster than the unaided eye could manage. Both experiences can enrich accepted ideas by making us suddenly recognize scenes, things, details that we hadn't noticed before.</p>
        <p>There is a third kind of photographic experience that has been around for some time and has become ever more common as photographers grapple with the threats to photography's reputation: a purely photographic experience, dependent on the method used (camera obscura, for instance) or the process, or the darkroom, and producing an image of something that doesn't quite exist outside of the image itself. For that, any old reality will suffice, even New York.</p>
        <p>''New York Now 2000: Contemporary Work in Photography'' is at the Museum of the City of New York, Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, through Oct. 15.</p>
