        <p>In the late 50's MGM assigned Alfred Hitchcock and the screenwriter Ernest Lehman to make ''The Wreck of the Mary Deare,'' a project of zero interest to either of them. Hitchcock had no fully developed alternative to suggest, but he told Mr. Lehman he wanted to make something that had a chase across the presidential faces on Mount Rushmore. He also envisioned a scene at the United Nations in which the speaker on the podium would declare, ''I refuse to continue until the delegate from Peru wakes up.'' The delegate, of course, is dead.</p>
        <p>By December 1958 Hitchcock and Mr. Lehman had incorporated these situations into ''North by Northwest,'' to be issued on Tuesday by Warner in a new edition on videocassette and DVD.

        <p>In the late 50's MGM assigned Alfred Hitchcock and the screenwriter Ernest Lehman to make ''The Wreck of the Mary Deare,'' a project of zero interest to either of them. Hitchcock had no fully developed alternative to suggest, but he told Mr. Lehman he wanted to make something that had a chase across the presidential faces on Mount Rushmore. He also envisioned a scene at the United Nations in which the speaker on the podium would declare, ''I refuse to continue until the delegate from Peru wakes up.'' The delegate, of course, is dead.</p>
        <p>By December 1958 Hitchcock and Mr. Lehman had incorporated these situations into ''North by Northwest,'' to be issued on Tuesday by Warner in a new edition on videocassette and DVD. With DVD's of new films ever more loaded with features generated by current directors and production companies, it is interesting to see how well a famous film can be represented when some major players aren't around to participate.</p>
        <p>Hitchcock died in 1980 and Cary Grant, the film's primary star in the role of Roger Thornhill, in 1986. But a new documentary, available on the tape as well as on the disc, warmly and gracefully recreates an experience from more than 40 years ago. Eva Marie Saint, Grant's co-star, introduces the film. Martin Landau, a heavy in ''North by Northwest,'' gives his Hitchcock imitation, but the major recollections are provided by Mr. Lehman, the screenwriter, who also contributes an audio commentary on the disc.</p>
        <p>As is usual on better discs, the pleasure is in the details. Grant charged 15 cents for autographs. Jessie Royce Landis, who plays Thornhill's mother, was younger than Grant. Ever the eccentric, Hitchcock, or so it is said in the documentary, never called actors cattle; he only said they should be treated like cattle. In any case he is remembered as a likabale tyrant, respectfully obliging to cast and crew.</p>
        <p>As Eve Kendall, Ms. Saint, now 76, received three instructions: lower your voice, keep your hands still and always gaze into Grant's eyes. ''With Hitchcock you got the sense you were the only one who could do it because you were there and he thought you could,'' she said in an interview. She added that she wasn't sure what he saw in her that landed her the role.</p>
        <p>''His eyes always followed beautiful women,'' Patricia Hitchcock, his daughter, says in the documentary. He liked white gloves and beige clothes. Ms. Saint wore both to an introductory lunch where everything but the script was discussed. That bothered her, she said, because Eve Kendall didn't appear until page 58.</p>
        <p>In his commentary, Mr. Lehman lauds Hitchcock's way with lighting and his genius with little touches, but he is more than a little put out that everybody lionizes Hitchcock but never him, the screenwriter. Ms. Saint agreed. ''What do they think -- Hitch made it up?'' she said in the interview. But one never doubts their feelings for the director. ''Funny and dear,'' Ms. Saint said. ''A class act.''</p>
        <p>New Video Releases</p>
        <p>Princess Mononoke</p>
        <p>Forces of man and nature battle in Hayao Miyazaki's sumptuously animated and exotically beautiful action film, set during the Muromacho period in Japan (A.D. 1392-1573). Sent into the forest to find the demonic forces that have contaminated him, young Ashataki finds himself caught in a running battle between a ruthless iron-mining baroness, Princess Eboshi (left), and woodlands creatures led by Princess Mononoke, herself part human and part wolf. While gods and demons struggle, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, a moral universe is created in a ''sweeping, ambitious version of the comic-book storytelling that engendered it.''</p>
        <p>1999. Miramax. $103. 135 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Aug 29.</p>
        <p>I Dreamed of Africa</p>
        <p>Reaching for the grandeur of ''Out of Africa,'' Hugh Hudson's film never rises above an epic travelogue. Packing up her young son, Kuki (Kim Basinger) goes to live in Kenya with her new husband, a bounder named Paolo (Vincent Perez). Trying to take flight with poetic profundities, Ms. Basinger manages only lifeless recitations as she and Paolo remain seriously miscast as ''adventure-seeking dilettantes who have wandered far beyond their depth to indulge in an expensive lifestyle experiment'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $105.77; DVD, $29.95. 114 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Aug. 29.</p>
        <p>The Big Kahuna</p>
        <p>Staking out a hotel room in Kansas, three salesmen scheme to unload a lot of product. Phil (Danny DeVito) is the showy type. Larry (Kevin Spacey) is the big kahuna, dominating Phil and Bob (Peter Facinelli), a fresh-faced young Baptist. Based on Roger Rueff's play ''Hospitality Suite,'' John Swanbeck's film airs tired secondhand truths in an exercise ''so transparent you could wrap sandwiches with it'' (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. Universal. $107.37; DVD, $26.98. 91 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Aug. 29.</p>
