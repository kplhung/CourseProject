        <p>One hundred and thirty evangelical Christians, including three visiting Americans on a religious mission, were arrested in central China on Wednesday as they attended a revival, according to a human rights monitor and the Americans' pastor in California.</p>
        <p>The raid was part of a continuing pattern of arrests, fines and other harassment of so-called house churches, mainly evangelical Protestant groups that have quietly spread their faith to tens of millions of Chinese while refusing to accept the authority of official religious bodies.</p>
        <p>It came one day after a top leader of the government-sponsored churches told an audience in Los Angeles that religion in China had entered a ''golden age'' of freer expression.</p>
        <p>The detained Chinese are followers of the China Fangcheng Church, which claims more than 500,000 members and is one of the largest of many fervent Protestant groups that meet and evangelize across the country without government approval. Such groups often receive encouragement and financial aid from like-minded churches in the United States, Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>American evangelicals say the beliefs and practices of the Fangcheng Church fall well within the Christian tradition. But the Chinese authorities have labeled this and several other similar groups as cults and in December sent two Fangcheng leaders to ''re-education through labor'' camps.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the American Embassy in Beijing said it had not yet been able to confirm with Chinese officials that three citizens were in police hands,  but said it was sending a consular officer to the area. Under an agreement, China must inform the embassy within 96 hours when an American is detained for any reason.</p>
        <p>When an American supporter of the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual group was detained this year, she was quickly deported.</p>
        <p>The mass arrests were first reported by the Hong Kong based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy. Today, a police officer in the township where the raid occurred, Dawangzhuang, in Henan Province, confirmed that a large number of worshipers were being held but would not say where.</p>
        <p>Often in such cases, most of those detained are soon released, but leaders sometimes face stiff fines or imprisonment.</p>
        <p>The detention of the three Americans, all of them Taiwan-born immigrants, was confirmed today by a pastor of their church, the Chinese Vineyard Church Fellowship in Los Altos, Calif.</p>
        <p>The Americans -- Henry Chu, 36; his wife, Sandy Lin, 28; and Patricia Lan, 25 -- traveled to China on Aug. 13 for a two-week mission in support of China's beleaguered Christians, the pastor said by telephone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chu, who has lived in the United States for 15 years, has an engineering degree and also completed seminary school, the pastor said, and volunteers much of his time to church work. Ms. Lin also graduated from college and a seminary and is a paid employee of the Vineyard Church Fellowship. Ms. Lan is a third-year seminary student.</p>
        <p>All three have made similar trips to China in the past, the pastor said, adding that his church alone, with some 300 members who are mainly ethnic Chinese from Asia, annually sends four or five small groups to China.</p>
        <p>Foreign missionary work is illegal in China, though informal outside aid to churches is sometimes tolerated.</p>
        <p>''The Fangcheng Church is not a cult,'' the pastor said. ''They are moderate and sound Christians. Its members are very faithful and fearless, and they want to save everyone for Jesus. That's why we want to help them.''</p>
        <p>The government-recognized leaders of China's five approved religions -- Protestant Christianity, Catholicism, Buddhism, Islam and Taoism -- arrived in the United States this week to take part in a world  conference of religious leaders at the United Nations in early September.</p>
        <p>In a speech in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Fu Tieshan, bishop of the official Chinese Catholic Church, which does not accept the authority of the Vatican, said religion in China was entering a ''golden age,'' with the number of believers growing and less official interference.</p>
        <p>''Religious believers and nonbelievers respect each other, are united and have a harmonious relationship,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Bishop Fu, reflecting the government's concern about the spread of uncooperative religious groups, also warned that too many of the people newly attracted to religion are poorly educated, and hence susceptible to heretical teachings and to cults.</p>
