        <p>In Iowa yesterday, an aide to Secretary of State Chester J. Culver put a slip of paper inside each of two black canisters. On one was written ''Buchanan-Foster,'' on the other ''Hagelin-Goldhaber.'' When the canisters had been placed in a glass bowl on a stand outside his office in the Capitol rotunda, Mr. Culver walked up, stirred them around and lifted one out.</p>
        <p>And that is how Patrick J. Buchanan and his running mate, Ezola Foster, became the Reform Party's presidential ticket in Iowa.</p>
        <p>An odd way, perhaps, to pick a presidential nominee, but such is the party's current state of affairs.</p>
        <p>What happened in Iowa yesterday,  and in several other states that have addressed the issue this week, is a direct consequence of a fractious convention two weeks ago that left the party split, with each of two candidates contending to be the rightful heir to state ballot designations in November and to $12.6 million in federal campaign funds.</p>
        <p>The bickering at the convention was only a prologue to what is going on now. Not only is Mr. Buchanan's  faction fighting over the money with John Hagelin's before the Federal Election Commission, the two sides are threatening lawsuits in various states over decisions that leave one or the other candidate off the ballot as the Reform nominee.</p>
        <p>John Duffy, a lawyer in Washington who represents Mr. Buchanan, said flatly, ''We will go into court wherever necessary not to allow anybody to identify themselves as the Reform Party candidate.''</p>
        <p>Iowa was one of at least four states that dealt with the Buchanan-Hagelin battle yesterday.</p>
        <p>In Montana, Secretary of State Mike Cooney, much like his Iowa counterpart, picked a name out of a ballot box that contained 10 canisters with ''Buchanan'' written on index cards and 10 with ''Hagelin.'' After Mr. Cooney had plucked out a Hagelin, a lawyer for Mr. Buchanan in Helena began drawing up papers seeking a temporary restraining order from a state district court to prevent Mr. Cooney from certifying a ballot with Mr. Hagelin's name.</p>
        <p>Jim Lippert, the lawyer, said the court would schedule a hearing within 10 days to decide whether Mr. Cooney's selection should stand, after which, he said, he expects the losing side to appeal to the Montana Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The Michigan Department of State's Bureau of Elections, meanwhile, sent a letter to both campaigns, asking each to make a case for its ticket.</p>
        <p>''But if it's not crystal clear who it should be, I could see us denying both requests,'' said Brad Wittman, a spokesman for the bureau. ''Then courts would have to decide.''</p>
        <p>In North Carolina, the state's Board of Elections heard testimony from both sides for more than four hours yesterday, and then voted 3 to 1 to put the Buchanan ticket on the ballot.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the week, two other states took action. One was California, where the fight may prove more grueling than anywhere else. There,  the state Reform Party is operating as one, splintered organization. Late Wednesday, Secretary of State Bill Jones withdrew Mr. Buchanan and Ms. Foster as the Reform ticket, after the state party's chairman, Raymond O. Mills, a Buchanan ally, acknowledged that its board, which favors Mr. Hagelin, voted last week not to support a Buchanan ticket.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills had told Mr. Jones last week that the state party recognized Mr. Buchanan as the Reform nominee. But John H. Place, the party vice chairman, told Mr. Jones in a letter that any communication with Mr. Mills should be considered ''null and void'' without evidence of the board's approval.</p>
        <p>Now the state party has until next Thursday to decide on one nominee and notify Mr. Jones.</p>
        <p>Kansas has taken another approach. On Tuesday, the office of its secretary of state rejected both sides' claims to the ballot, advising them to take their complaints to the State Objections Board, which would sort things out and pick one, leaving the loser to take matters into court.</p>
