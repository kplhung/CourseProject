        <p>On a visit Wednesday to the state where his legacy is larger than that of anyone since the man who bought Alaska from Russia for 2 cents an acre, former President Jimmy Carter again had to pass through a knot of people shouting his name and waving placards in his face.</p>
        <p>But instead of burning Mr. Carter in effigy and shouting obscenities as Alaskans have done in past visits, the crowds that greeted him in the twilight of summer hailed Mr. Carter as a hero and visionary for what has been called the greatest conservation act in American history.</p>
        <p>Nearly 20 years ago, just weeks before handing the presidency to Ronald Reagan, Mr. Carter signed a bill that protected an area of Alaska equal in size to California. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act declared 104 million acres as national parks, wildlife refuges and wilderness. It more than doubled the acreage in the national park system and tripled the amount of public land that could not be developed.</p>
        <p>The Lands Act, which Alaska's political and business elite saw as a betrayal of the state and a blueprint for economic ruin, has helped to spur a $1 billion annual tourist economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter used his triumphant return to Alaska this week to urge President Clinton to settle an issue left unresolved when the act was passed: whether to allow oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge is a summer range for more than 100,000 caribou and untold numbers of birds. But it also holds what is believed to be the nation's largest untapped oil fields, perhaps holding up to 10 billion barrels, which would be second only to those of Alaska's North Slope.</p>
        <p>For the first time, Mr. Carter called on Mr. Clinton to declare the refuge a national monument, which would infuriate many Alaskans because it would almost certainly prevent development. Mr. Clinton does not plan to declare the area a monument, his aides said today, but they did not rule out the possibility that he might change his mind in the waning days of his presidency, especially if Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee, is elected.</p>
        <p>For the business interests that have never gotten over the passage of the Lands Act, the prospect of new protections is unwelcome.</p>
        <p>''That is what Alaskans fear the most,'' said Carl Portman, deputy director of the Resource Development Council, which represents major businesses in Alaska.</p>
        <p>The question of what to do with the Arctic refuge, which has been largely overlooked outside Alaska, could be the biggest environmental decision by the next president. Mr. Bush favors opening the refuge to oil and gas development, while Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, says it should be protected, although he has not called for designating it as a monument.</p>
        <p>History has been kind to Mr. Carter's act, the former president said this week, and some prominent Republicans in this state grudgingly agreed. In December 1980, a month after he was voted out of office, Mr. Carter signed a bill that had been fought over, in one version or another, since Alaska became a state in 1959. It has been called the biggest zoning act in history, designating 10 new national parks, monuments and recreation areas and protecting nearly a third of the state from development. Mr. Carter ranks it among his biggest achievements.</p>
        <p>But at the time, it looked as if Mr. Carter would never be able to set foot in this state. At the Alaska State Fair, he recalled, he was a bigger villain than the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, as people lined up to throw bottles at his image. Just months after Mr. Carter left office, he stopped in Anchorage on his way to Tokyo, and the Secret Service urged him not to leave the air base for fear of what angry Alaskans might do to him.</p>
        <p>One National Park Service plane was burned at Wrangell-St. Elias, the biggest national park in the nation, and the cables were cut on another plane. The governor of Alaska at the time, Jay Hammond, a Republican, said he would sue to stop the act, calling it a ''de facto repeal of statehood.'' Alaska's Congressional delegation vowed to undermine it.</p>
        <p>''A lot of predictions were made that Alaska would go to hell if this much land was taken away from gas and oil development,'' Mr. Carter said in a speech here Wednesday before 600 people that drew five standing ovations. ''But Alaskans have done well. Tourists come here to find a solitude, a beauty, sites that are not available to a Georgian or someone from Ohio or Maine.''</p>
        <p>Alaska has become one of Mr. Carter's favorite places. He has heard the thunder of caribou herds as they migrate out of the Arctic Slope, he has seen a brown bear up close, and he has caught a 31-inch rainbow trout on a very small fly. This week he planned to fish at Lake Clark National Park, one of the parks created by the Lands Act.</p>
        <p>More than three million tourists a year visit the new parks, refuges and monuments created by Mr. Carter. In Seward, the town named for Secretary of State William Seward, who bought Alaska for $7.2 million in 1867, a multimillion-dollar industry has developed around ships that take visitors to the bird rookeries and glaciers of Kenai Fjords National Park. The town rescinded a 20-year-old resolution opposing Mr. Carter's action.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hammond, the former governor, has also had a change of heart. Seated on the dais with Mr. Carter on Wednesday, he said most Alaskans now favored the act for which Mr. Carter was so vilified.</p>
        <p>But even though Alaska's Congressional and business leaders no longer talk of overturning the Lands Act, they say it has blocked access to many areas and stifled needed development in rural communities. Many people want snowmobiles, new roads and airstrips in the parks and monuments. They say small-time miners, the archetypal sourdoughs of Alaska, have been shut out of the lands.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter's critics say the interests of Alaska were overlooked by a leader far removed from the state.</p>
        <p>Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, opposed the act 20 years ago and still says it was wrong.</p>
        <p>Greg Thom, a spokesman for Representative Don Young, a Republican who has been Alaska's Congressional representative for more than 20 years, said, ''Signing the act was one of the darkest days in Alaska history, a travesty of justice.''</p>
        <p>None of Alaska's Congressional leaders were at the anniversary luncheon for Mr. Carter on Wednesday, nor was Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat. But for the overflow crowd, it was a celebration that had a ''told you so'' air.</p>
        <p>''I remember what Morris Udall, the congressman most responsible for the act, said when he came back to Alaska in the mid-80's,'' Deborah L. Williams, executive director of the Alaska Conservation Foundation, said at the celebration. ''He said, 'Just like in the 70's, everyone waves at me, but this time all five fingers are extended.'
