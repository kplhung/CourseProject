        <p>Michael Chang helped out in a Long Island soup kitchen this week and yesterday he interrupted his second-round match in the Hamlet Cup to assist a ball girl overcome by heat.</p>
        <p>His heroics did not stop there.</p>
        <p>Just five hours after defeating Byron Black, 7-5, 1-6, 6-4, in a match that had been rained out the previous night, Chang was back on the stadium court last night in Commack, N.Y., where he defeated the No. 7-seeded Patrick Rafter, 6-4, 6-4.</p>
        <p>Rafter, a heavy crowd favorite, took the first game on four aces and then pounded Chang's serve to go up a break.</p>
        <p>But the always patient Chang fought back from 0-3 to move into the quarterfinals of the Hamlet Cup for the sixth time since 1992.</p>
        <p>In the daytime portion of his doubleheader, Chang was up a break and leading by 30-15 in the second game in the second set against Black when he suddenly dashed to the back of the court and caught 15-year-old Rebecca Shore of Smithtown, N.Y., in his arms as she was about to topple over.</p>
        <p>After making sure Shore was safely off the court (she was dehydrated, her father said), Chang double-faulted that game away and lost the next three games en route to dropping the set. But he came back to win, setting up a quarterfinal match with Arnaud Clement today.</p>
