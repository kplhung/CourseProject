        <p>Good works don't necessarily make good films.</p>
        <p>So while it is possible to admire ''God's Army'' as an act of piety, and for its unusual subject and unpretentious performances, this film about Mormon missionaries eventually becomes preaching that is  likely to tax the credibility of the unconverted.</p>
        <p>Written and directed by Richard Dutcher, who is also one of its stars, ''God's Army'' tells the story of  Brandon Allen (Matthew Brown), a 19-year-old Mormon missionary assigned to Los Angeles under the tutelage of Marcus Dalton (Mr. Dutcher), a dedicated 29-year-old member of the faith.</p>
        <p>With a few other young missionaries, they share an apartment where college dorm pranks are commonplace. Wearing white shirts and neckties, they spend their days on the streets of the city, ringing doorbells, distributing literature and seeking conversions that take them among prostitutes and into the homes of ordinary people.</p>
        <p>Among themselves, the missionaries study, pray and are subject to crises of faith.</p>
        <p>Brandon himself stuggles with his faith but is less troubled than Elder Kinegar (Michael Buster), who reads voraciously in literature that attacks the tenets of Mormons. The steadfast, uncompromising member of the community is Elder Dalton (Mr. Dutcher in a convincing performance), a former medical student who is dying of cancer.</p>
        <p>''All right, let's do some good,'' he is fond of saying at the start of the day.</p>
        <p>From time to time the paths of the young men cross the paths of the female missionaries Sister Fronk (Jaque Gray) and Sister Monson (Kelli Coleman), but the principal drama of ''God's Army'' spins around the relationship of Elder Dalton and Elder Allen to Benny (Doug Stewart), a lame young man who vanishes on the eve of his baptism.</p>
        <p>His reappearance as a mugging victim, shorn of spirit and convinced that death is near, sets the stage for ''God's Army'' -- which opens today at the 59th Street East Cinema (239 East 59th Street, Manhattan) -- to exhibit its faith in a manner that mingles sentimental drama with religious devotion.</p>
        <p>''God's Army'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some hospital scenes and bathroom humor.</p>
