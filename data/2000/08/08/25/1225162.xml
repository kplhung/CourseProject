        <p>A maverick theory about the origin of life has received striking support from an experiment that mimicked the violent interactions of deep seated rock and common gases in the Hadean epoch, the days when the earth had just formed as a planet.</p>
        <p>Researchers found to their surprise that even in such hellish conditions they had created a chemical that is crucial for the metabolism of living cells.</p>
        <p>The result is evocative because the chemical, known as pyruvate, is a crucial component of living cells, being the fuel for a universal energy producing process known as the citric acid cycle.</p>
        <p>The new finding, reported in today's issue of Science by Dr. George D. Cody and his colleagues at the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Geophysical Laboratory, does not explain how or where life began but it supports a theory that proposes a new way of looking at this long intractable problem.</p>
        <p>The theory, proposed by a German patent attorney, Dr. Gunther Wachtershauser of Munich, holds that the origin of life should be sought by looking for a metabolism, some repeated cycle of chemical change, that could have taken place on the early earth and that could then have built itself up into more complex molecules and organisms. This contrasts with the conventional approach, which is to take familiar parts of today's cells, like nucleic acids, and try to figure out the conditions in which they might have formed spontaneously.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wachtershauser dismisses the latter approach as the broth theory because even when a researcher has found conditions under which the individual chemical ingredients of life might have been formed, it is hard to explain why they should then assemble themselves into living cells.</p>
        <p>He calls his own proposal ''the iron sulfur world theory'' because he believes that metallic surfaces, particularly that of the common mineral iron sulfide, would have been promising facilitators, or catalysts, of the chemical reactions that created the precursor chemicals of living cells.</p>
        <p>It is unusual for amateurs, even a qualified chemist like Dr. Wachters hauser, to contribute to the specialized worlds of modern science. And his ideas, being only theoretical, did not arouse much enthusiasm until 1997 when he showed that an iron- sulphur surface could promote the conversion of carbon monoxide to a two-carbon chemical important in biochemistry of living cells.</p>
        <p>To biochemists, his finding had particular resonance because at the center of many enzymes are iron and sulfur atoms that transfer electrons in ways vital to the cell's energy requirements. The idea that living cells are elaborate codifications of some primitive chemical cycle that got going on an iron-sulfur surface is to them not so alien.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cody and colleagues at the Carnegie Institution decided to use a special high-pressure apparatus they possessed to explore how Dr. Wachtershauser's proposed system might work at sites like the volcanic vents in the deep ocean. This kind of chemistry is a dangerous pursuit, since at high pressures water becomes a violent acid and carbon monoxide eats through steel.</p>
        <p>''We set out to explore the ability of minerals to catalyse reactions that would be important in a primitive metabolic sense,'' Dr. Cody said. Putting iron sulfur, a source of carbon monoxide into their reaction tube, ''We came across an unanticipated result,'' he said. That was the formation of large amounts of pyruvate. The tube also contained a hydrogen sulphide-like chemical to mimic the hydrogen sulfide produced by volcanoes.</p>
        <p>Pyruvate consists of three carbon atoms linked together and is an obvious building block from which sugars and the other carbon-based molecules of life can be constructed.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wachtershauser believes the origin of life lies in autocatalysis, the emergence of some natural chemical process, like the pyruvate-producing one, in which the products help the reaction go faster.</p>
        <p>''Evolution is better and better autocatalysis,'' he said in a phone interview yesterday.</p>
        <p>If one of these autocatalytic processes started to generate the class of fatty chemicals known as lipids, these might form a bubble round the system and the first cell would be generated. The cell would have left the surface on which it was generated and later developed the elaborate information-storage system embodied in today's DNA molecules.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael W.W. Adams, a biochemist who studies early life at the University of Georgia, said Dr. Wachtershauser had developed a very reasonable and testable hypothesis for the origin of organic material relevant to life. ''It makes so much sense to have metal catalysts involved at the dawn of life,'' Dr. Adams said, ''especially metal sulfides, because these are essential to most energy conserving processes. I very much think he is on the right track.''</p>
        <p>In a written commentary on Dr. Cody's report, Dr. Wachtershauser said that, with the creation of pyruvate, all of the eight sequential steps needed to make peptides from carbon monoxide had now been shown to be chemically possible. Peptides are short chains of amino acids, the components of the protein molecules that are the workhorses of the living cell.</p>
        <p>The new results ''greatly strengthen the hope that it may one day be possible to understand and reconstruct the beginnings of life on earth,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 26, 2000, Saturday  An article yesterday about an experiment in support of a maverick theory about the origin of life was truncated in some copies. The last sentence, quoting Dr. Gunther Wachtershauser of Munich, who proposed the theory, should have read, ''The new results 'greatly strengthen the hope that it may one day be possible to understand and reconstruct the beginnings of life on earth,' he wrote.''</p>
