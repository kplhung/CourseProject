        <p>It will take about a month for Verizon Communications to work through roughly 50,000 delayed repairs and more than 200,000 orders for new service as a result of the strike.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, customers in need of new telephone service have few alternatives aside from acquiring a wireless phone. Even if customers try to get local dial-tone service from one of Verizon's competitors, like AT&amp;T or MCI WorldCom, there could be delays because these companies use parts of Verizon's network infrastructure.</p>
        <p>''The main thing people can do is be patient,'' said Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon, which was created by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. Verizon customers in the 12 Eastern states and Washington, where the strike took place, can call customer service numbers on their bills, on which the company has just begun to substitute its new name. Or they can use Verizon's Web site, www.verizon.com, to order new service or request repairs.</p>
