        <p>PACKARD-Robert K. Beloved husband of Bobbie Packard; Cherished father of Lauren (11), Cassie (9) and Sam (6); Loving brother of Dana Packard, Becky Packard and Leslie Martin; Devoted son of John and Barbara Packard. A resident of Hillsborough, CA. He was 42 years old. Mr. Packard was a principal of Texas Pacific Group. He received his MBA from Stanford (1989), B.A. from Harvard College (1980) and J.D. from Harvard Law School (1983). A Memorial Service will be held at St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in San Mateo on Monday, September 4, 2000, at 4:30 P.M. with a reception to follow at the Packard home in Hillsborough. Memorials to the Robert Packard Foundation for ALS Research, 345 California St., Ste. 3300, San Francisco, CA 94104 Contact: Anne Martin 415-246-7776</p>
        <p>PACKARD-Robert K. The partners of Texas Pacific Group mourn the passing of their partner and friend, a victim of ALS. Bob was a leading technology investor and financier, always focused on a better future, as he helped fuel the growth of New Economy companies. He was also a warm and giving friend, generous, understanding and caring. His commitment to the Robert Packard Foundation for ALS Research, which he founded, has helped to bring much needed attention to this condition, raise substantial contributions, and make a cure more likely. Our thoughts go out to Bob's wife, Bobbie; his children, Lauren, Cassie and Sam; and his entire family. His passing is a deep personal loss to all who knew him and so many in the technology industry who benefited from his wise counsel, innovation and insight. David Bonderman James G. Coulter William S. Price III Founding Partners, Texas Pacific Group</p>
