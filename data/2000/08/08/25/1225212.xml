        <p>A Continental Airlines plane nearly landed on a closed runway at Newark Airport before dawn yesterday, but an air traffic controller noticed the impending mistake and ordered the plane up before it could land.</p>
        <p>The plane, on a red-eye flight from San Francisco, was cleared to land on one of two parallel runways at 6:15 a.m., a slow time for the normally busy airport, said James Peters, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. But the pilot aligned the jet, a Boeing 757, with the left-hand runway instead of the right-hand one.</p>
        <p>Just as the plane reached the runway's threshold, the air traffic controller handling the flight noticed, Mr. Peters said, and ordered the pilot to ''go around.''</p>
        <p>The pilot ''powered up, circled the field, came back and landed on the first runway,'' Mr. Peters said.</p>
        <p>He said that such ''go-arounds'' or ''missed approaches'' -- when a pilot cannot execute a planned landing -- happened several times a day at busy airports like Newark. Sometimes they are requested by pilots, other times by controllers, but they rarely occur because a plane is heading for the wrong runway, he said.</p>
        <p>Both the controller and the pilot followed go-around procedures correctly, said Mr. Peters, adding that no one was hurt and that the flight was not delayed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peters said the flight standards district office at Teterboro Airport would investigate the incident by obtaining tapes of ground-to-air communications and radar data showing the flight's path.</p>
        <p>The incident occurred as an airport duty manager, Dan Harvey, was inspecting the runway, which had been closed for routine electrical maintenance, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harvey was monitoring air traffic on his car radio and heard the controller's instructions, then saw the plane emerge from the morning fog, said Steve Coleman, an airport duty manager.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peters, the Federal Aviation spokesman, said it was too early to speculate on what caused the mistake. An automated information service for pilots was announcing that 22-Left was closed, he said.</p>
        <p>A union official defended the air traffic controller, a 13-year veteran. Daniel D'Agostino, president of the Newark division of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, told The Associated Press that tapes of air-to-ground communication showed that the pilot had misunderstood the controller's instructions.</p>
        <p>Catherine Stengel, a spokeswoman for Continental Airlines, said the company did not know what instructions the pilot had received nor how quickly he had responded to the go-around order.</p>
