        <p>Anthony D. Layne, the terminal duty manager at La Guardia Airport, looked through his van's swishing windshield wipers and sized up the traffic jam of jumbo jets idling before him on the taxiway.</p>
        <p>''I think,'' he said, in a nice bit of understatement, ''that things could get a little hairy out here today.''</p>
        <p>It was a summer Friday, one of the busiest days at La Guardia. Yet as summer Fridays go, this one was relatively tame. In the terminal, flight information screens flashed only a few delays. The Mimlitsches of Colorado Springs, Frank and Martina and their three children, were not even particularly upset about the long line at the American Airlines counter. They made it up to the ticket agent in nine minutes. ''Not so bad,'' Mr. Mimlitsch said.</p>
        <p>But while there was no air rage raging inside the airport, no teeming of crowds familiar to the veteran La Guardia traveler, there was a whole airport's worth of angry people teeming somewhere else: out on the tarmac, in their respective planes, which by early afternoon were lined up 25 deep waiting to take off. This situation meant that although most airplanes pushed away from the gates right on time that Friday, it was at least an hour, and sometimes more, before they were airborne.</p>
        <p>It also meant that untold numbers of connections to final destinations were missed, dozens of gates at other airports were kept idle waiting on those late planes, dozens of other flights at those airports were delayed as a result and so on around the country, like a bad echo.</p>
        <p>None of this was a result of anything extraordinary, just a few minor storms hovering near the New York region and a volume of flights that meant even the slightest delays quickly became big delays. And all this happened on a day of only average traffic: 846 takeoffs and landings on La Guardia's two runways, which on a very busy day handle 1,200.</p>
        <p>But to spend a day at La Guardia in Queens is to examine through a magnifying glass the factors that have converged to make this summer the worst for airline delays in history, not only here but around the country, provoking a debate about whether the nation's air transportation system is overloaded.</p>
        <p>La Guardia is a good case study not necessarily because of the way it is run or because of its delays, though it does often rank among the worst in the country for delays and long taxi times. It is a good example, instead, because it is probably the most extreme case of what many experts say is a chief cause of air travel problems: an airport infrastructure that has not kept pace with the increase in air traffic.</p>
        <p>In the case of La Guardia, this is because it is hemmed in between Flushing Bay and the Grand Central Parkway, with little room to grow. Two oversized photographs hanging in the airport's Port Authority operations office tell this story better than any statistics can.</p>
        <p>One picture is from 1964, when the airport's new main terminal opened. The other picture is an aerial view of the airport a few years ago, showing a virtually unchanged setting: a crescent with four arms stretching out behind it for jet gates; a tangle of taxiways; the same two runways, now slightly longer, reaching out toward the bay.</p>
        <p>But there is one big difference in the pictures. In the 1964 photo -- taken when there were about 200,000 takeoffs and landings a year at the airport -- a couple dozen jets are parked at gates or moving toward the runways. In the recent photo, taken when the number of takeoffs and landings was more than 350,000 a year, it seems as if nearly every square inch of tarmac is covered with jets.</p>
        <p>In addition, the airport's two runways now handle traffic coming from the Delta Air Lines terminal, built in 1983, and the US Airways main terminal and shuttle terminal, built in 1992.</p>
        <p>Because La Guardia serves so many airlines, which fly to so many cities, it is like a finely calibrated instrument that can be thrown into disarray by the smallest disruption -- bad weather here or anywhere else, late arrivals, air traffic control glitches or bunching, when airlines schedule too many flights at once.</p>
        <p>A $340 million renovation, which is nearing completion, has made the terminal much more comfortable and modern, adding food courts and enlarging the lower baggage area. Taxi space has also been improved over the years, but there is certainly no room to add what is most needed -- more runways -- so congestion has become more common.</p>
        <p>Mr. Layne has seen tarmac traffic jams so many times that they no longer faze him much. One recent Friday, the culprit was what Mr. Layne refers to as popcorn storm cells, small clusters of turbulent weather, which were north of the city, causing only light rain at the airport, but forcing air traffic controllers to space out takeoffs slightly. Zipping around jets, Mr. Layne pointed toward the radio in his van, which was tuned to the channel used by the officials who direct traffic to the runways.</p>
        <p>''The reason why you hear those long periods of silence on there,'' he said, ''is because nobody's moving out here. They don't have anything to tell anybody.''</p>
        <p>Or as Peter Yerkes, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, put it: ''La Guardia is getting kind of like the George Washington Bridge: a constant rush hour. There are peaks and valleys, but the peaks and valleys are getting a whole lot closer together.''</p>
        <p>Inside the United Airlines concourse that Friday, Stephanie Black, a church secretary from Ossining, N.Y., was suffering from the results of that constant rush hour. She had just put her 9-year-old son, Daniel, on a flight by himself back to Denver to be with his father. The jet pushed away at 11:29 a.m., a minute early. As she waited, it did not take off. And it continued to not take off. Thirty minutes passed. Then forty-five. Ms. Black needed to go back to work. At 12:20, the jet finally thundered down the runway.</p>
        <p>''When he flew in here from Denver, his plane was two hours late,'' said Ms. Black, 29. ''I'm sure he's in there tearing his hair out, probably asking the pilot if he can fly it himself.''</p>
        <p>Another reason that La Guardia makes an interesting laboratory for viewing flight delays is that it is one of the few airports in the country whose traffic is still limited by the Federal Aviation Administration's high-density rule, which was created in 1969 to prevent overtaxing the air traffic control system. The rule, which now has many exemptions, basically means that no more than 1,224 flights are supposed to take off and land during La Guardia's peak hours, from 6 a.m. to midnight.</p>
        <p>But because of the exemptions and a steady increase in the number of flights being scheduled by the major airlines, the flight limit has not prevented the growth of traffic at La Guardia, especially in the last few years. A chart of all La Guardia aircraft movements -- those of big jets, commuter jets, private jets and propeller planes -- shows that last year, for example, there were 371,000 takeoffs and landings, up from 358,157 in 1998 and 345,647 in 1996.</p>
        <p>Last April, President Clinton signed a law intended to expand service between New York and smaller cities by creating more slots for small regional jets, those that hold up to 71 passengers, to come into and leave La Guardia.</p>
        <p>Critics of the law, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and officials in Queens, have sued to try to stop the addition of slots. They contend that the measure could add as many as 500 flights a day to the airport, swamping it, causing more delays, clogging traffic on the Grand Central Parkway and creating more noise in the skies.</p>
        <p>David Z. Plavin, the president of the Airports Council International, a trade association representing major airport operators, said that La Guardia was among 22 national airports classified by the federal government as severely congested, meaning that they have 20,000 hours or more of delays a year, the equivalent, collectively, of waiting around for 834 days for your plane to take off.</p>
        <p>Despite the growing outcry from passengers about those delays, the chances for La Guardia, or many of the other airports, to ever get off that list remain dim. In large part, this is because demand for air travel is expected only to increase, as flying becomes a more common form of mass transportation.</p>
        <p>Airlines respond to that demand, Mr. Plavin said, not only with many more flights, but also, increasingly, with smaller planes, which are more economical for the airlines and yet mean more takeoffs and landings for the same number of people. The result is a constant and intensifying struggle between demand and the resources of airports and air traffic controllers.</p>
        <p>''What I think we're seeing is a tension in the system of people wanting to have more frequency to places they want to fly and airlines obliging, but the system not being able to handle that as efficiently as we need it to,'' Mr. Plavin said. ''It used to be that you had two flights a day between some major cities, and now there are maybe 10 or 20 or 30 by the same airlines. It's not just a matter of insufficient hardware and facilities.''</p>
        <p>Al Graser, the deputy director of aviation for the Port Authority, which has operated La Guardia since 1947, said that per square foot, La Guardia was still the most efficient airport in the country. In other words, though this may be cold comfort for the average traveler, the airport does a pretty good job with what it has.</p>
        <p>And even if, by some magic, La Guardia could add a few runways and triple its taxi space, there would still be traffic jams like the one that rainy Friday, because the next choke point in the system is the air traffic control system, also overburdened from the region's other airports.</p>
        <p>If the regional jets begin to pour into La Guardia as a result of the new federal law, said Mr. Graser, a former general manager of La Guardia, ''hopefully they'll be prudent and move some of their traffic away from the peaks.''</p>
        <p>But any way you look at it, he said, ''adding another 600 flights a day -- it just can't happen.''</p>
