        <p>Verlyn Klinkenborg Editorial Observer on final installment of television program Survivor says that contestants, having played by the rules for so long, will find it hard to buck them now; says as cameras follow them everywhere and deals beckon, the real game of survivor will begin (M)</p>

        <p>The first premise of game-playing is that nobody rebels against the game itself. That premise worked almost to a fault in ''Survivor,'' the desert-island game show -- let's discard forever the phrase ''reality-based'' -- that ended Wednesday night. If survival had really been at stake, the first thing the 16 contestants would have done last March, when the show was taped in the South China Sea, was take hostage the CBS camera crew and the host, Jeff Probst, and demand $16 million for their release. It would have made better drama and edgier viewing, something like a remake of ''Papillon'' by the producers of ''The Blair Witch Project.''</p>
        <p>But everybody obeyed the rules. The contestants banged the gong as they entered the tribal council area. They competed in inane contests and childish rites. They kept their mouths shut, under the threat of stiff penalties, when they were voted off the island. Nobody groaned, except perhaps inwardly, when Jeff Probst said, ''You created a new civilization.''</p>

        <p>The first premise of game-playing is that nobody rebels against the game itself. That premise worked almost to a fault in ''Survivor,'' the desert-island game show -- let's discard forever the phrase ''reality-based'' -- that ended Wednesday night. If survival had really been at stake, the first thing the 16 contestants would have done last March, when the show was taped in the South China Sea, was take hostage the CBS camera crew and the host, Jeff Probst, and demand $16 million for their release. It would have made better drama and edgier viewing, something like a remake of ''Papillon'' by the producers of ''The Blair Witch Project.''</p>
        <p>But everybody obeyed the rules. The contestants banged the gong as they entered the tribal council area. They competed in inane contests and childish rites. They kept their mouths shut, under the threat of stiff penalties, when they were voted off the island. Nobody groaned, except perhaps inwardly, when Jeff Probst said, ''You created a new civilization.''</p>
        <p>Maybe he had a point. This indeed is how new civilizations are created. Strangers bearing complicated contracts show up in places they deem to be uninhabited and lay down the rules. Then they name an S.U.V. after the civilization they displaced. The supreme test in the final episode of ''Survivor'' was whether Mr. Probst could say the words ''Pontiac Aztek'' without breaking the mood.</p>
        <p>But the mood went unbroken, at least until the ''Survivor Reunion,'' which immediately followed the final episode and whose host was a particularly chirpy Bryant Gumbel, who looked as though he had just been voted off the island of Nantucket.</p>
        <p>Created by footage that comes straight from the genre of nature documentaries and awash in New Age sound emitted by some New-Age-sound sausage machine, the mood of the final episode of ''Survivor'' was in fact unbreakable. Words that once had meaning were simply eviscerated, words like ''tribe,'' for instance.</p>
        <p>Television is truly the hyperbolic machine, the medium in which ''the ultimate human experiment,'' as ''Survivor'' was billed, was really to see whether CBS could get 50 million Americans to watch a show for which the network could charge a fortune for commercials. The experiment was a success.</p>
        <p>There they were, though, the people we had tuned in to see, their personae sharper than ever -- Rudy, looking more and more like a disgruntled iguana; Kelly, almost indecipherably impassive at times; Rich, coiled fetally on the final day; and Sue, who has given truck drivers everywhere a bad name and whose motto was ''I never regret what I say,'' when clearly she should have. At the last it was Kelly and Rich, the one making a plea for personhood, the other for gamesmanship. You all know who won.</p>
        <p>The worst of it is that we are stuck now in ''Survivor''-survivor hell. Commercials beckon the contestants. So does Playboy. For a time the cameras will follow Rich and Sue and Rudy and Kelly -- and Gervase and Jenna and Colleen, too -- everywhere they go. Having played by the rules for so long, the contestants will find it hard to buck them now. And then the real game of survivor will begin.</p>
