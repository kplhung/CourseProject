        <p>The Toronto International Film Festival turns 25 this year, having shown 5,790 features and shorts, by actual count, since its inception in 1976. This year's edition, which runs from Sept. 7 to 16, will add 300 titles or so to that figure.</p>
        <p>In those 25 years the festival has grown from a strictly local event organized by a group of Toronto businessmen into one of the primary stops on the international festival circuit, the North American counterpart of Cannes, Berlin and Venice.</p>
        <p>''There was no one year when we incrementally grew,'' said Piers Handling, who joined the festival's staff in 1982 and has been its director since 1994. ''It was year by year, adding 10 films one year, 10 more the next. There have been no massive leaps, no huge shifts in terms of artistic direction. It's a festival that has valued its continuity and as a result has grown organically. It hasn't had to deal with outsiders. It was all insiders who were promoted into the key jobs, so there was nobody who came in and thought they had to change the whole thing.''</p>
        <p>What Toronto has grown into is a festival that combines public support with a large professional presence, which means that visiting critics and distributors see movies alongside a huge and famously responsive local audience. (By contrast, festivals like Cannes and Sundance are attended almost exclusively by industry types.) It's a chemistry that creates the crucial festival commodity called buzz, the sense of excitement that grows around unknown films.</p>
        <p>For example Jean-Jacques Beineix's ''Diva'' had already flopped in France when David Overbey, a programmer, brought it to the 1981 festival, where it became a word-of-mouth smash and was picked up for distribution. That year the festival also fielded the North American premiere of an untested British feature, ''Chariots of Fire,'' which went on to win the Oscar for best picture.</p>
        <p>'' 'Chariots of Fire' put us on the map and legitimatized us in the eyes of the industry, that a film like that could play here and break out into major awards,'' Mr. Handling said. ''Festivals were always perceived as events for art films, for cinephiles. The studios were afraid of their films' being described as festival films. But Toronto is a large public festival; it's very inclusive; it's non-competitive; it has something for everybody. That's been its philosophy since it was founded. We will show anything from experimental cinema and documentaries to films from foreign cultures to studio films.</p>
        <p>''That's the thread that runs from 'Chariots of Fire' to 'American Beauty,' '' he said, referring to the most recent Oscar winner to have had its premiere in Toronto. ''When you can actually prove to the studios that there is commercial value in their film coming to your event, then they won't be afraid of you.''</p>
        <p>Among the high-profile films to have premieres at this year's festival are ''Almost Famous,'' a comedy about a teenage rock journalist directed by Cameron Crowe (''Jerry Maguire''); Kathryn Bigelow's erotic thriller ''The Weight of Water''; and the military drama ''Men of Honor,'' with Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr.</p>
        <p>And for unrepentant cinephiles, there will be new offerings from the directors Tom Tykwer (''Run, Lola, Run''), Wong Kar-wai (''Chungking Express'') and Stephen Frears (''My Beautiful Laundrette''). The schedule, along with ticket-ordering information, can be found at the festival's Web site, www.e.bell.ca/filmfest.</p>
        <p>A Master Recalled</p>
        <p>''The Mr. Kurosawa I knew was like a little boy,'' says Emi Wada, who won an Academy Award for designing the costumes for Akira Kurosawa's ''Ran.'' ''He was gentle, shy and truly an artist.''</p>
        <p>''Ran,'' a transposition of ''King Lear'' to 17th-century Japan, is generally considered the last great film of Kurosawa, the Japanese master who died in 1998. First released in 1985, it is being reissued nationally by Winstar, both theatrically and on DVD.</p>
        <p>Responding to questions by fax from her home in Tokyo, Ms. Wada recalled her collaboration with Kurosawa. They ''met for the first time at a party to celebrate the completion of his film 'Dersu Uzala' in 1974,'' she wrote. ''There I learned that he was planning to make a film based on Shakespeare's 'King Lear.' In 1983, when 'Ran' was about to start filming, I went to see Mr. Kurosawa. I talked to him about my ideas, and he decided to hire me on the spot. And at that moment the title 'costume designer' first came to existence on a Kurosawa film.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wada went on to design the costumes for movies including Peter Greenaway's ''Prospero's Books'' and Nagisa Oshima's ''Gohatto,'' which had its premiere at this year's Cannes International Film Festival, as well as for numerous operas and theater pieces in Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>''As the preparation of 'Ran' began, Mr. Kurosawa and I drew numerous sketches,'' Ms. Wada remembered. ''If all those pieces of drawing paper were piled up, it would come to about 20 centimeters high or more. He would continually say to me, 'This design is marvelous, but can you come up with something better?' I would work on it some more, add things or sometimes change the idea completely.</p>
        <p>''For the costumes of 'Ran' I was thinking of the theatrical, symbolic, stylized costumes of Noh, focusing on the fabric with a static silhouette. These costumes were more suitable for the film than costumes in the actual period style.</p>
        <p>''For the main characters I decided on the colors first, and then the patterns, and then the material that would make the most out of all those elements. For example, the costume of the leading character, Lord Hidetora, started with a pure white and ended with a thoroughly soiled white. For the three brothers I decided on yellow, red and blue as the main colors, and I changed the intensity of the colors depending on the situation.</p>
        <p>''After working six months like this, finally he approved the designs, and I started weaving them. Mr. Kurosawa entrusted me with creating the fabrics, from selecting the threads to deciding on their thickness, the dye and how they should be woven. When the first woven cloth was done, I showed it to Mr. Kurosawa. He congratulated me that I made something better than he aimed for.''</p>
        <p>Americans in Paris</p>
        <p>Two New York University film students, Caran Hartsfield and Peter Sollett, have been chosen to participate in a new program, the Cinefondation Residence, sponsored by the Cannes Film Festival. In October they will join four other students in a five-month residency in Paris, where they will develop projects for their first feature films under the guidance of French film professionals. Oliver Assayas, who wrote and directed ''Irma Vep,'' led the selection committee.</p>
