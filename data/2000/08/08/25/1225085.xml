        <p>THIS town tends to generate hot air of one kind or another year round, and the weather can get spectacularly toasty, even in a coolish summer like this one. Luckily, the city compensates with acres on acres of air-conditioned museum space, and a lot of very good art to fill it.</p>
        <p>At the moment, the big museums aren't necessarily the main attractions. The National Gallery of Art is focused on an Art Nouveau blockbuster to open in the fall. The much-traveled Norman Rockwell survey is at the Corcoran but will be heading to New York. So, after you have seen the smart, laconic Ed Ruscha retrospective at the Hirshhorn, you would do well to check out a few local art paths less traveled by.</p>
        <p>My vote for most far-out show of the moment goes to ''Amazons in the Drawing Room: The Art of Romaine Brooks'' at the NATIONAL MUSEUM OF WOMEN IN THE ARTS. The museum itself, two blocks from the White House, is a trip, architecturally speaking. It was built in 1908 as a Masonic temple and later did active duty as an X-rated movie theater. Its outstanding architectural feature is a soccer field-size atrium with oddly disposed galleries running off it on different levels. This unorthodox layout is actually well suited to the art and life of Romaine Brooks (1874-1970), an expatriate American painter who in a series of memorable portraits of women succeeded in establishing a lesbian visual presence in early-20th-century art.</p>
        <p>Born Beatrice Romaine Goddard in Rome, Brooks was a daughter of wealthy Americans. She had a dreadful childhood. Her father deserted the family soon after she was born. Her unstable mother alternated between sadistically punishing and ignoring the children. (There was another daughter as well as a boy, St. Mar, who died insane.) The artist worked for years on an autobiographical account of her youth. She titled it ''No Pleasant Memories.''</p>
        <p>She lived mostly in New York until 1896, when she went to Italy to study art. On the island of Capri, she found a resort favored by upper-class Europeans and Americans, with an extensive gay circle. One of its members was John Ellingham Brooks, to whom she was briefly married. She also met Somerset Maugham and Charles Lang Freer, founder of the Freer Gallery of Art here. Freer may have introduced her to the art of James McNeill Whistler, whose somber palette she emulated.</p>
        <p>When her mother died in 1902, Brooks became rich and independent. She settled in Paris, where she was an integral part of the city's artistic haute monde. Her career flourished. Her first one-person show was at the renowned Durand-Ruel  Gallery and was made up almost entirely of paintings of women.</p>
        <p>In 1910 she had a fling with the Italian poet and politician Gabriele D'Annunzio. The romance was brief, but they remained soul mates, and his proto-fascist ideology had a lasting effect on her thinking. (She painted a portrait of him as a kind of martyred Mr. Sensitive; it's in the show.) They were also rivals for the affections of the dancer Ida Rubinstein, a star of the Ballets Russes. Brooks won the contest. Rubinstein became her lover and the subject of a series of sensually zany portraits.</p>
        <p>In one morbidly erotic, Symbolist-tinged piece, Rubinstein floats nude and dead pale on an Art Nouveau swirl of white paint that suggests a bird's wing or a shroud. In another, she's dressed in the uniform of a Red Cross nurse, with a starchy wimple. For this patriotic image, painted during World War I, Brooks was awarded the French Legion of Honor.</p>
        <p>The affair with Rubinstein was soon over. In 1915 Brooks met the Paris-based American writer Natalie Barney, with whom she began a nearly lifelong relationship. Possibly as a result of Barney's forthright Sapphist views, Brooks's portrait style became more realistic and more intent on shaping a new concept of femininity.</p>
        <p>She tried various approaches. In a brash 1924 portrait of the British aristocrat Una Troubridge, the companion of the novelist Radclyffe Hall, her subject wears mannish clothes and a monocle that contrast with her  girlish bob and lipstick. Troubridge's prize Dachshunds are by her side. Brooks, who had mixed feelings about Hall, later hinted that she had meant the portrait as a joke, but whatever her intentions, it's a groundbreaking, gender-bending image.</p>
        <p>She could also be tender, as she is in ''Peter, a Young English Girl,'' a portrait of the androgynous-looking British artist Hannah Gluckstein, who went by the name of Peyter Gluck. And her well-known 1920 portrait of Barney, titled ''The Amazon,'' is done mostly in soft gray-lavenders and furlike textures against a background of falling snow.</p>
        <p>The two women came to lead a strangely insular existence in a rapidly changing Europe. They were ahead of their time in their attitudes about sexuality and gender. But as the art historian Whitney Chadwick suggests in the exhibition catalog, they subscribed to an ideal of a social, sexual and even racial elite that led them to view Nazism favorably.</p>
        <p>Their insularity is also reflected in Brooks's art. Although she lived in Paris during an epoch of exhilarating aesthetic experimentation, she stayed, as many other artists did, with the figurative style of an earlier day, branching out only slightly with a series of automatist drawings in the 1930's.</p>
        <p>Even so, there is no artist like her. In a 1923 self-portrait, she presents herself, at age 49, with close-cropped hair, wearing a top hat and a black hacking jacket, the scarlet Legion of Honor ribbon in its lapel. Her pallor is intense: she has applied white paint as if it were stage makeup, and her eyes are half-hidden by the hat brim. Alert, glittering, self-possessed, they're barely visible in reproductions, so it's a bit startling to see them when faced with the picture itself in the museum.</p>
        <p>Brooks has carefully set up that reaction. One of the points of the picture is that she's watching you before you get close enough to look at her. She's not passively inviting your approach; she's deciding whether you're worth bothering with. Chances are, you're not, at least not if you're approaching with the conventional notions of what male and female mean. Whereas in the Troubridge portrait, Brooks is still separating out signs of gender (pants, lipstick), here she has created a new kind of being, uncategorizable and unitary, in total control of her own identity.</p>
        <p>Brooks also took control of her artistic legacy. Although she lived most of her life in Europe, she left nearly two dozen of her best portraits to the Smithsonian's American Art Museum, formerly the National Museum of American Art, and they make up about half of this show, which was organized by Joe Lucchesi, professor of art and art history at St. Mary's College of Maryland. Whatever one's quarrels with Brooks's unconscionable politics, her outspoken lesbian presence in don't-ask-don't-tell Washington is a stroke of poetic justice.</p>
        <p>Arthur M. Sackler Gallery</p>
        <p>The intersection of politics and art is also an underlying theme of three very different modest-size shows at the Freer and Sackler galleries, adjoining museums that house the Smithsonian's collection of Asian art.</p>
        <p>''The Heroic Past: The Persian 'Book of Kings,' '' organized by Massumeh Farhad at the Sackler, is a visual essay on the quasi-mystical role that kingship played in the culture of Iran. Among the earliest items here is a superbly wrought fourth-century Sasanian silver-and-gilt plate with an image of a ruler, probably Shapur II, in the muscle-flexing pose of cosmic hunter.</p>
        <p>Then, leaping centuries, come manuscript paintings of scenes from the ''Shahnama,'' or ''Book of Kings,'' the Persian royal epic. The poem is endless -- some 50,000 verses -- but every newcomer to the throne felt compelled to commission a freshly illustrated version of it, as a symbolic seal of legitimacy for his reign.</p>
        <p>This is, of course, nice for the viewer, because the vivid narratives frequently brought out the best in court artists. A page from one of the greatest of such books, produced in Tabriz around 1525, shows the heroic warrior Rustam being saved from a lion by his horse, Rakhsh. In this case, the perilous encounter is turned into an exotic ballet with a Leon Bakst set, all gilt and baby blue, with a lion as sweet as a kitten.</p>
        <p>In an earlier painting of a battle scene, the sprightly and the grisly are balanced. The Persian king Kay Khusraw may have the benign face of an overgrown baby, but he is slicing off an enemy's arm with his sword. Beneath him lies the corpse of a soldier, cut in half and gushing blood. He's been placed in the margin of the page, outside the picture itself, as if to push the realities of war into the reader's sphere.</p>
        <p>That is precisely the intention of the work in a second Sackler exhibition, ''A Well-Watched War: Images From the Russo-Japanese Front, 1904-1905.'' The Japanese woodblock prints gathered here by James Ulak, along with paintings by British magazine illustrators, were designed as journalistic reports on the struggle between Japan and Russia for the possession of Port Arthur, a warm-water harbor in northeast Asia.</p>
        <p>The pictures are pure propaganda and sometimes almost as fanciful as the ''Shahnama'' paintings: military leaders striking valiant poses, enemies cut (or in this case blown) to bits. Accuracy is blocked out by wishful thinking. One woodblock print shows a Russian ship being attacked and destroyed by Japanese torpedoes; but apparently the face-off never happened, or happened differently. The ship was seen later intact and afloat.</p>
        <p>Many photographs of the war were taken, but the medium was still regarded with suspicion, as either too realistic for public consumption or not realistic enough. Instead, and for the last time, publishers and audiences alike favored cushioning, interpretive hand-wrought images that turned war into an operatic spectacle.</p>
        <p>Freer Gallery of Art</p>
        <p>At the Freer, political realities run, however subtly, through ''Brushing the Past: Later Chinese Calligraphy From the Gift of Robert Hatfield Ellsworth,'' a showcase of 20 works of late-18th- through 20th-century calligraphy selected from the 260 given to the museum by Mr. Ellsworth, a well-known New York collector, dealer and historian.</p>
        <p>Organized by Joseph Chang, the show is a modern history in a nutshell of this most revered of Chinese art forms. Stylistic currents are clearly traced. So is an organic, discursive pattern of lineal descent, with artists taking cues from their immediate forebears but also rummaging through the past, rejecting and rediscovering and always extending the thread of tradition.</p>
        <p>This process was rocky in the later 20th century, particularly during the Cultural Revolution, with its manic swings between denunciation and approval of traditional forms. But resilient voices persevered, and the Freer show, which comes with an excellent catalog, is like an intimate party of mature, quietly forceful personalities who seem young beyond their years.</p>
        <p>Museum of African Art</p>
        <p>Parties are also in progress at the National Museum of African Art. The livelier of the two is titled ''A Concrete Vision: Oshogbo Art in the 1960's'' and highlights the work of a group of artists in the town of Oshogbo, a Yoruba commercial and religious center in southwestern Nigeria.</p>
        <p>In the 1950's, Oshogbo was celebrated for its theater and dance troupes. Then local visual artists joined forces with a few European residents, notably Ulli and Georgina Beier, to explore styles that combined African and modern Western elements. (Jacob Lawrence lived and taught here in 1962.)</p>
        <p>Much of the work is figurative and refers to Yoruba myths and beliefs, appropriate for a town that is a pilgrimage site for Oshun, the goddess of waters. Of the 11 artists in the show, organized by David Binkley, the best known is the man who calls himself Twins Seven-Seven. (He was the only surviving child of seven sets of twins.) He came to Oshogbo as a dancer, met the artists and started to draw. He eventually settled on a format of paint and ink on plywood with which he depicts spirits and fantastic animals in intricate nets of color and line. He remains active in the town today in art, music and local politics.</p>
        <p>A second exhibition, ''Trans-Atlantic Dialogue: Contemporary Art in and Out of Africa,'' organized by Michael Harris, also deals with cultural interaction, specifically between African-American artists who have spent time in Africa and African-born artists who have come to the West.</p>
        <p>There seem to be affinities between the decorative paintings of Skunder Boghossian from Ethiopia and those of the American artist Jeff Donaldson, and between the puzzlelike geometries of certain pieces by John Biggers and those of the African-born Moyo Okediji. But the most dynamic pairing by far is in a compact room of paintings by Jean-Michel Basquiat and the Nigerian-born Ouattara. They met in Paris in the 1980's, by which time Basquiat had been to Africa, and were friends in New York. Seen side by side, their works generate a mutual energy that goes beyond a mere sharing of motifs.</p>
        <p>The rest of the show feels tepid by comparison. This has to do partly with the art, but the disjointed installation, which straggles over two large rooms, has to take some of the blame. This museum consistently exhibits contemporary work, which is great, but it is still in search of an effective way to present it. The pressure-cooker effect of the self-contained Basquiat-Ouattara hanging may suggest a solution.</p>
        <p>Textile Museum</p>
        <p>For a last look at the intricacies of cultural sharing, head away from the Mall for the Textile Museum, on a leafy street near Dupont Circle. Founded 75 years ago by the businessman and collector George Hewitt Myers, it occupies a pair of brick town houses that retain signs of their domestic origins. The museum has some 16,000 textiles and carpets, a substantial research library and permanent and temporary exhibition spaces.</p>
        <p>Its new show, ''Tribal Traditions: Village and Nomadic Weaving of Anatolia,'' which opens Aug. 25, is  drawn mostly from the permanent collection and adds up to a rich little primer in the flat-weave rug styles that have emerged around four cities in Anatolia -- Bergama, Konya, Malatya and Erzurum -- in the last two centuries.</p>
        <p>Many of the designs, assertive and brightly colored, originated in nomadic cultures and were meant to be clearly readable from a distance. When nomads were forced to settle in one place, to facilitate taxation by the Turkish government, rug patterns came to be associated with particular villages. Some of these connections are intact, though with more and more work done for commercial markets, certain motifs have floated free for general use.</p>
        <p>Sara J. Wolf, the curator, manages to throw a light on all aspects of this complex dynamic. In one inspired installation, six prayer rugs seem suspended in mid-air: they represent the distinctive and almost unvarying rug style perpetuated by a single village group. By contrast, a rug completed just last year by a village weaver named Hediye Ustun, in a region around the city of Konya, is based on a motif borrowed from a neighboring village and turned into a different, virtuosic variations-on-a-theme design.</p>
        <p>It's easy to get completely absorbed in this fascinating material, but be sure to see ''Considering Excellence: Great Works From the Textile Museum's Collections,'' the small show upstairs, through Nov. 5. It includes a gorgeous tapestry-weave Peruvian poncho, a gold-threaded Indian shawl and a sheer gauze-weave summer coat of yellow silk from China. Perhaps most fetching of all, though, is an Iranian prayer cloth from the 18th or 19th century: all white, handkerchief-size, embroidered with minute silk flowers, it looks as light and cool as a perfect summer day.</p>
