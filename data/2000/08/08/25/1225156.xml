        <p>A mailing from an anti-immigration group has angered residents in Sparkill, N.Y., a mostly white town in Rockland County that has begun to experience an influx of newcomers from other countries, especially Hispanics.</p>
        <p>The official-looking letters were sent by a group called American Immigration Control, which is based in Washington. A copy found its way this week to the mailbox of the Dominican Sisters of Sparkill, on Route 340, a convent that provides services to a growing local Hispanic population.</p>
        <p>The letter requested donations for anti-immigration lobbying and warned of tax dollars being spent on bilingual education programs for immigrants and ''the printing of voting ballots in foreign languages.''</p>
        <p>Thom Kleiner, the supervisor of the town of Orangetown, which includes Sparkill, called the mailing ''inappropriate propaganda that doesn't reflect the view of our residents.'' He said the copy sent to the convent was the only one that had come to his attention.</p>
        <p>The mailing included an ''Immigration Impact Survey,'' which asked questions like, ''Have you noticed an increase in foreign languages in your community?''</p>
        <p>And it warned, ''There are substantially increasing levels of immigration projected for your area,'' adding, ''Are you concerned about what the statistical increase in crime associated with the growing immigration rates may mean to the Sparkill area?''</p>
        <p>One of the sisters gave the mailing to Gail K. Golden, a chairwoman of Rockland's Immigration Consortium, a coalition of community groups that offers help to new immigrants for school, health care and other services.</p>
        <p>According to the 1990 census, Sparkill is 88 percent white and 8 percent Asian. The town recorded only 36 immigrants, mostly Southeast Asians, between 1990 and 1996, but Ms. Golden said more immigrants, mostly Hispanic, had been settling there and in surrounding towns.</p>
        <p>When she saw the mailing, ''I felt frightened,'' Ms. Golden said. ''The letter was inflammatory and racist and tapped into the kinds of feelings and responses not good for community, but rather divisive and destructive.''</p>
        <p>But a spokesman for American Immigration Control, John C. Vinson, brushed aside those concerns today. Mr. Vinson confirmed that the group had sent copies of the letter to the area, but said he could not say how many were sent.</p>
        <p>''We rent mailing lists from patriotic organizations,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The group was founded in 1983 to lobby to make immigration laws stricter, Mr. Vinson said, including ''cutting immigration back to reasonable levels'' of roughly 250,000 a year, instead of the current annual quota of about one million.</p>
        <p>The group has been sending letters nationwide for years, he said. Mr. Vinson called accusations of racism a ''programmed response from an alliance of extreme liberals who want cheap votes and extreme conservatives who want cheap labor.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Their agenda hurts this country and hurts many immigrants as well, because wages are driven down. I have a friend who is a Puerto Rican and lives in New York City, and he says he loses jobs all the time to immigrants.''</p>
        <p>But Karen LaFiandra, a Sparkill housewife who teaches English to the area's growing Hispanic population at Christ Episcopal Church, said of the letter: ''It's outrageous. We don't want hatemongers from outside trying to stir up fear in our community.</p>
        <p>''Yes, we have a lot of Spanish immigrants coming to Sparkill lately, but I don't think it's a problem,'' she said. ''My husband's parents come from Italy, and I come from the Bronx, where there's a lot of diversity.''</p>
        <p>There has been an increase in Hispanic immigrants to southern parts of Rockland County in recent years. The village of Haverstraw's population, for example, is roughly half Hispanic, according to the county's Department of Planning.</p>
