        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT'' (Tony winner for best musical, choreography and featured actor and actress). The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly un related vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Deborah Yates and the Tony winners Boyd Gaines and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical, it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form as ''Contact'' weaves romance from a reality we are all familiar with (2:00). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $85 (Ben Brantley).</p>

        <p>*+ ''COPENHAGEN'' (Tony winner for best play, director and featured actress). Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (the Tony-winning Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $65; $25 student rush at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''DIRTY BLONDE.'' Stand up, boys, and take your hats off. Mae West is back on Broadway in this compact Rolls-Royce of a vehicle written by and starring Claudia Shear. Eight decades after a play with the forthright title ''Sex'' landed her in jail, West is proving that she still has the power to shock and delight. She has also, not incidentally, provided the inspiration for what is hands down the best new American play of the season. This tale of an icon and two of her idolizers (played by Ms. Shear and Tom Riis Farrell) is no evening of mere impersonation; it's not ''Mae West Tonight!'' What Ms. Shear and her director, James Lapine, have shaped is a multilayered study of the nature of stardom. Bob Stillman rounds out the protean three-member ensemble. ''Dirty Blonde'' presents one of the canniest portraits on record of that floating dialogue between celebrities and fans that remains so much a part of American culture (1:45). Helen Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6262. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $65 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''KISS ME, KATE'' (Tony winner for best musical revival, director of a musical, musical actor, costumes and orchestration). A mouthwatering revival, with ham as the plat du jour, of Cole Porter's sybarite's delight of a musical about battling egos in show business. As presented by a preening cast led by the wonderful Marin Mazzie and the Tony-winning Brian Stokes Mitchell, who wear a spotlight as if it were a dressing gown and vice versa, this ''Kate'' proves that ham can indeed make a banquet if the spices are zesty enough. Avoiding the attitudes that are anathema to lively revivals of vintage musicals -- reverence and condescension -- the director Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad, brazen and finally irresistible. The production, which doesn't seem to have a thought in its giddy head beyond entertaining us as much as it is entertaining itself, feels like one long ear-to-ear grin. The top-drawer Porter score has been beautifully orchestrated by Don Sebesky and is appetizingly sung (2:20). Beck, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29 to $84 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER.'' This revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's 1939 farce, starring Nathan Lane in a role famously modeled on Alexander Woollcott, feels busy without being lively. Under the direction of Jerry Zaks, the production seems to exist in neither the then nor the now. Much of the acting is a series of flourishes that sell individual jokes without being anchored to character or context. And Mr. Lane, looking like a cuddly, Mattel-made Sigmund Freud doll in his beard and spectacles, never quite comes up with a coherent performance; it's as if he is still experimenting with his options. Tony Walton's richly colored set is a showroom-perfect evocation of period style that fits nicely into the newly restored American Airlines Theater (formerly the Selwyn). But the evening's most authentic glimpses into a vanished era of madcap celebrities are provided by Lewis J. Stadlen, in a character inspired by Harpo Marx, and Byron Jennings, as a charming Noel Cowardesque narcissist. Unfortunately, their appearances onstage feel as brief and brilliant as lightning (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $70, half-price for children 18 and under (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''THE MUSIC MAN.'' A show that makes you feel ridiculously happy one instant and seriously sleepy the next. The director and choreographer Susan Stroman, who created the inspired dance-musical ''Contact,'' isn't as confident in her take on Meredith Willson's jubilant story of a traveling con man who brings rhythm to the stolid town of River City, Iowa. Her transforming imagination stops when the music stops. The production has two perfectly agreeable stars in Craig Bierko, in the title role, and Rebecca Luker, as the frosty librarian who learns to melt. But you get the impression that most people onstage are just pretending to live in a land of corn-fed propriety and corny jokes, marking time until a production number comes along to let them show their stuff. When the show is singing or, especially, dancing, it often seems to have winged feet; when it's just talking or clowning around, those feet are flat (2:50). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''BAAL.'' Brecht's first play, about an amoral poet with insatiable carnal appetites who corrupts everyone he comes in contact with, is given a raw and raucous production by Jim Simpson and his fledgling Bat Theater Company. Using a new translation by Peter Mellencamp that pulls no punches in its explicit language and the title character's misogynistic views of women, the rough-and-tumble staging runs through 21 scenes that chronicle Baal's path of seduction as he descends from dissipation to depravity to despair. Led by Michael J. X. Gladis as Baal, an energetic cast of 14 actors portraying more than 30 characters recaptures the sense of adventure that is too often missing in today's theater. Performed at 10 p.m. on a bare black box of a set in a downtown basement and with the excellent jazz trio of William Connell Jr., Jeremy Blunn and Ian Riggs playing bebop and progressive on the side, the show rekindles the spirit and excitement of the old after-hours avant-garde. Mr. Simpson has moved the play from Berlin in the early 1920's to New York in the late 1940's, and the result is like a trip back to the iconoclastic days of the early Beats. The only things missing are the black berets, real espresso and the Gauloises (1:40). Flea, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407. Thursdays through Saturdays at 10 p.m. Tickets: $15 (Wilborn Hampton).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE COUNTESS.'' John Ruskin does not have a happy marriage. ''I don't like the way you look, sound or move,'' he tells his wife, Effie, in Gregory Murphy's serious but wonderfully witty period drama, directed by Ludovica Villar-Hauser. Ruskin (James Riordan), the 19th-century art critic and essayist, invites a friend to join the couple on their Scottish holiday. The guest, the painter John Everett Millais (Jy Murphy, replaced tonight and tomorrow night by Victor Villar-Hauser), likes Effie (Jennifer Woodward) a lot. But then his and Ruskin's beliefs about women are very different. ''All bachelors marry goddesses,'' Ruskin observes, ''but husbands live only with women.'' Millais says, ''To idealize is to destroy, smother.'' Things get ugly -- in a civilized way (2:20). The Lambs, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $40 and $55 (Anita Gates).</p>
        <p>+ ''THE CRUMPLE ZONE.'' This new play by Buddy Thomas is uneven, but it has a lot going for it: a nicely structured plot about a gay household with a love triangle coming to crisis at Christmastime, sequences of physical comedy that are antic without being overblown into slapstick and an effective set that evokes a pleasantly chintzy apartment on Staten Island. Most of all, though, it has a bristling, funny performance by Mario Cantone, who plays the squeaky wheel, a clamorously lonely man on the outside of the triangle looking in. Mr. Cantone is known for his high-pitched stand-up comedy work, and he knows how to take over a room. In this case the room is a tiny apartment, but he works it as a diva would. He is the kind of actor who seems most in control when he's in a tizzy, with a voice that easily and naturally runs up to shrill. But this is not a shrill performance. Even in high dudgeon there's no tension in Mr. Cantone's face or his body language, no sense of Method acting when he's working up to a fever pitch, just the wicked glee of a man who loves to seize the spotlight. The magnitude of his neurotic charisma in such a small space gives his character the hilariously keening pathos that makes the play work (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, near West 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 206-1515. Mondays, and Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $35 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>+ ''DE LA GUARDA'' (''VILLA VILLA''). Gravity takes a holiday in ''Villa Villa'' by the Argentine troupe De la Guarda, which is something like an airborne ''Stomp'' staged in a mosh pit. Over the heads of a standing audience, performers swoop on long tethers, yelling as they whiz by. They run up the walls, dance in midair or swing down to scoop up audience members, acting out images of pursuit, teamwork and domination. The music works up to rock-concert volume, joining sound to the hyperkinetic fury (1:10). Roth, 20 Union Square East, at 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 7 p.m. Tickets: $40 and $45; $20 rush available two hours before show (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>*+ ''DINNER WITH FRIENDS.'' It would be difficult to forge a more harmonious union of cast, director and script than the one created at the Variety Arts Theater, where Daniel Sullivan's unflinching production of Donald Margulies's rueful play deserves a long and healthy run. Mr. Margulies has fashioned a deceptively straightforward suburban comedy. He has chosen the most shopworn of subjects, marital infidelity. Yet his take is so forthright and clear-eyed that the normal array of yuppie hang-ups are made rawer here, more disturbing. What initially seems a rather conventional glimpse at the perils of breaking up becomes an original examination of the terrors of staying together. The production, which has been given a gorgeous shelter-magazine sheen by the set designer Neil Patel, is as satisfyingly professional as they come (2:10). Variety Arts, 110 Third Avenue, at 13th Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $60 (Peter Marks).</p>
        <p>* ''FULLY COMMITTED.'' Dining out at the top of the food chain is apparently not about evolved cooking. It's about plain old bribes, threats, tantrums, humiliation and outright sadism. If it weren't so sad, it would be funny. Well, it is very funny, actually, at least as it plays out in this mocking dismantlement of megalomaniacal chefs, coked-up maitres d'hotel, food-averse V.I.P.'s and customers with explosive bowels. Becky Mode's one-person play, with the actor Mark Setlock portraying a harried reservations taker at a four-star restaurant where everyone and his grandmother want to eat, does as much to shake the foundations of the temples of haute cuisine as a squadron of flies in the vichyssoise. Rarely has a playwright pegged so entertainingly the insecurity at the heart of Manhattanites' sense of entitlement (1:30). Cherry Lane, 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Marks).</p>
        <p>*+ ''JITNEY.'' ''Don't put your business in the street,'' advises a character in this splendidly acted production of August Wilson's early comic drama about a gypsy-cab company in Pittsburgh. As if that were remotely possible in the Hill District, the setting of Mr. Wilson's cycle of plays about the black American experience in the 20th century and a place where private business is always on parade: real life is always the best show in town. ''Jitney,'' which has been extensively revised since its first production in 1982, could be described as just a lot of men sitting around talking. But the talk has such varied range and musicality and is rendered with such stylish detail that a complete urban symphony emerges. There are occasional whiffs of standard-issue melodrama. But under Marion McClinton's sensitive direction, every performer shines as a soloist and as a member of the chorus. It's the finest ensemble work of the season (2:35). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3. Tickets: $51; $21 student rush (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''JULIUS CAESAR.'' With a busy percussionist pounding out portents; a post-apocalyptic-looking set of massive, defaced cement walls; a cast that plays the entire evening in a high dudgeon; and the whole production watched over by an enormous gold-plated bust of Caesar dangling from a crane, the New York Shakespeare Festival's ''Caesar'' has the garish bravado of a political convention. That may be a coyly chosen comparison, but the play, starring David McCallum as Caesar, Jamey Sheridan as Brutus and Jeffrey Wright as Marc Antony, was a timely choice for this summer. And even though the fire-and-brimstone treatment is apt enough for Shakespeare's virulent treatise on the combustible chemistry of power and eloquence, this is a 'Caesar'' that, as the gathered Democrats and Republicans did, leaves you feeling shouted at and implored but not terribly moved (2:30). Delacorte Theater, Central Park, (212) 539-8750. Tuesdays through Sundays at 8 p.m. Free (Weber).</p>
        <p>+ ''THE LARAMIE PROJECT.'' An enormously good-willed, very earnest and often moving work of theatrical journalism. Overseen by the director and writer Moises Kaufman, the inspired talent behind ''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' this more self-conscious production examines the impact of the brutal killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay university student, on the town of Laramie, Wyo. Eight actors play 60 characters based on interviews conducted by Mr. Kaufman and his ensemble in Laramie in the wake of the crime. The young, clean-scrubbed cast is more effective in creating a general climate of feeling than in summoning authentic portraits of individuals, yet there's no denying the work's emotional pull. The overall effect is not unlike one of the candlelight vigils described here, a stately procession through which swims a stirring medley of emotions: anger, sorrow, bewilderment and, most poignantly, a defiant glimmer of hope (2:35). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $55 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>++ ''NEIL SIMON'S 'HOTEL SUITE.' '' An omnibus show, a repackaging of elements from Mr. Simon's previous ''Suite'' plays, with some rewriting by the playwright. It consists of four hotel room episodes, two visits each to different marriages, each pair a showcase of a separate aspect of the playwright's comic predilections. The first and third reveal Mr. Simon in bittersweet mode; they focus on an English couple, she an accomplished but insecure actress, he an urbane antiques dealer who also happens to be bisexual with a bias toward men. The second and fourth episodes show Mr. Simon's slapstick side as the marriage of a Jewish couple from Philadelphia is tested by familial rites of passage. It is well performed and snappily staged, but with Mr. Simon's retrograde battle-of-the-sexes humor in full evidence, the show couldn't be less hip. Still, that's not an entirely terrible distinction; you watch with a kind of campy amazement at the jelled-in-amber social attitudes, the punch-line jokiness of the dialogue and the well-worn clowning. And besides, the nostalgia of it all may well be the point (2:20). Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, 7:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays, 2:30 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $27.50 to $55 (Weber).</p>
        <p>''SPINNING INTO BUTTER.'' Everyone is talking about race these days. But who's talking to whom, about what and why? Rebecca Gilman's play turns these questions into a tense farce set on a Vermont college campus filled with self-congratulation about its commitment to diversity. Commitment turns to crisis when a black student starts receiving racist letters. Can the administration find the culprit, confront the moral issues and turn a crisis into a public relations coup? Talk may be cheap, but its consequences are lethal. Hope Davis is excellent as the most emotionally complex of the administrators. Daniel Sullivan's direction is too brash, and Ms. Gilman is struggling with the balance between force and subtlety. The play is worth seeing, though. This is the stuff theater should be spinning, churning and beating into art (2:00). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Mondays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday and Saturday matinees at 2. Tickets: $55 (Margo Jefferson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>''SURFACE TRANSIT.'' It was smart of the organizers of the first New York Hip-Hop Theater Festival to make Sarah Jones's one-person play its centerpiece. Ms. Jones first presented it a couple of years ago in the East Village, and since then she and the show have grown. Among artists most respected by other hip-hop poets and performers, Ms. Jones has the clearest sense of distance; she can satirize the phenomenon in ways that open it up for people who think there is something mysterious about it. The eight characters she creates include an octogenarian who burns with the desire to be with it, whatever ''it'' is; a Russian immigrant trying to persuade her small black daughter to ignore racial slurs hurled at her by their Flatbush neighbors; a West Indian black woman with a British accent who pops into a studio for an MTV spot audition; and a white policeman who abuses women and hates gay men but could not possibly have anything against gays because his best friend from childhood ''is one of those'' (2:00). P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288. Through tomorrow. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Tickets: $25; $15 student tickets with identification (D. J. R. Bruckner).</p>
        <p>Long-Running</p>
        <p>Summaries of reviews by Ben Brantley and Peter Marks:</p>
        <p>* ''CABARET.'' This wildly popular if at times preachy incarnation of the Kander and Ebb musical is ensconced quite mesmerizingly at Studio 54, where it remains a lurid, deliberately grim presentation of Weimar decadence as a prelude to the Holocaust (2:30). 254 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $90; $25 rush except on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
        <p>+ ''LES MISERABLES.'' A war horse, to be sure, but a stately crowd-pleaser, too, filled with gorgeous harmony and pageantry. Still, as in the early days, you barely crack a smile (3:15). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8; last Monday performance, Aug. 28.Tickets: $20 to $85.</p>
        <p>*+++ ''RENT.'' This landmark rock musical by Jonathan Larson about love and death East Village style still seems to invigorate audiences with its big, harmonious score. A sentimental triumph (2:45). Nederlander, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $80; $20 tickets by lottery on day of show at box office.</p>
        <p>* ''STOMP.'' This joyous percussive show, danced to the music of clanging bric-a-brac you find in your garage, is as crisp and exuberant as if it had opened yesterday. The performers remain an exhilarating precision marching band of working stiffs (1:45). Orpheum, 126 Second Avenue, near Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 477-2477. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10:30 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $29.50 to $55.</p>
