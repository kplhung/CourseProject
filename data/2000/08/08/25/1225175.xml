        <p>One was a star 2-year-old who is now on the comeback trail from a knee injury, another has done his best running in Canada, the third is trying to become only the fifth gelding to win the Travers Stakes in 131 years. Over all, it's not the most star-studded field in the history of the Midsummer Derby, the oldest race in the nation for 3-year-olds.</p>
        <p>But in a year of attrition for horse racing's glamour division, Dixie Union, Milwaukee Brew and Unshaded were tabbed the three favorites today for the $1 million centerpiece of the Saratoga meet, a race that will be run Saturday afernoon.</p>
        <p>With the Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus on the sidelines until the fall and Preakness winner Red Bullet out for the year after a debilitating bout with ulcers and a viral infection, nine colts have an opportunity to make a name for themselves.</p>
        <p>Curiously, the Triple Crown veterans still running were pegged the second longest shots in the field: Belmont winner Commendable and Derby and Preakness third-place finisher Impeachment were both listed at 12-1.</p>
        <p>But Richard Mandella, trainer for the favored Dixie Union, warns that those who want to dismiss this year's crop of 3-year-olds as weak are way too premature. ''I don't go along that this is an ordinary bunch,'' Mandella said. ''Let's wait a year or two and see who beats whom; time tells a lot about these things.''</p>
        <p>He should know. Last November, Dixie Union had won four of five and was a solid contender for 2-year-old champion when he went to the gate in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile late last fall.</p>
        <p>A bad step, however, led to a fifth-place finish and surgery to have a bone chip removed from the colt's knee. One of the most patient trainers in the sport, Mandella decided to skip the Triple Crown races and waited until May to race Dixie Union again.</p>
        <p>The colt won his return race and then finished second twice by a combined total of two lengths before roaring home the winner in the $1 million Haskell Invitational three weeks ago at Monmouth Park.</p>
        <p>In the Travers, Dixie Union will break from the No. 7 post position and most likely will stalk early runners like Albert The Great and Commendable.</p>
        <p>''We've learned to live with waiting,'' said Mandella, who has previously trained champion horses Kotashaan and Phone Chatter. ''We know we're lucky to have Dixie Union back in the shape you hope for.''</p>
        <p>The second choice in the Travers also is a ''Who's That?'' colt. He's Milwaukee Brew, who until July was in Canada with trainer Tino Attard for owner Frank Stronach. (The big horse in Stronach's barn in New York is none other than Red Bullet.)</p>
        <p>Despite not making his debut until February, Milwaukee Brew has won four of seven, including a come-from-behind victory to win the Ohio Derby. He closed too late, however, to catch Dixie Union in the Haskell, finishing third.</p>
        <p>"I'm looking forward to running him at a mile and a quarter," said Attard, who has Jerry Bailey aboard. ''The extra furlong will help us. If the Haskell was a furlong longer, I think we could have won it."</p>
        <p>The gelding trying to make history is Unshaded, a long-striding son of Unbridled whom trainer Carl Nafzger has pointed to this race ever since winning the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland in April.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month in the Jim Dandy, Unshaded and jockey Shane Sellers encountered traffic trouble down the backstretch and again on the turn, but unleashed a kick that was good enough for third place. It was the first race back for Unshaded after finishing a similar late-running third in the Belmont in June</p>
        <p>''The Jim Dandy was a good race for him,'' said Nafzger. ''He got steadied and he maintained. They didn't leave us and we didn't catch them. If we didn't get a good race there, we wouldn't be in the Travers. It takes him a while to get it together, but he's more focused than he's ever been.''</p>
        <p>Another dangerous horse in the Travers also got knocked around in the Jim Dandy before recovering and running second to front-running Graeme Hall, who will miss this race due to a training injury. That horse is Curule, who is owned by the Dubai-based Godolphin stable and first ran on American dirt in the Kentucky Derby. He ran a respectable seventh, but he has flourished since then while remaining in the United States.</p>
        <p>''If he can improve a little bit off the Jim Dandy, he should be right there in the Travers,'' said Eric Coatrieux, assistant to the trainer Saeed bin Suroor.</p>
        <p>''When he was coming out of the last turn, he had to check a bit and couldn't make his move as soon as we wanted him to. He seems to relax more now and he's more mature.''</p>
