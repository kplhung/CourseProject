        <p>A variety of new companies are beginning to offer below-market prices on prescription drugs and services like doctor, dental and eye care and medical tests.</p>
        <p>Like buyers' discount clubs such as Costco or Sam's Club, the new companies attract people looking for a better price, in this case because they have no health insurance or because their health insurance does not cover the treatments they want.</p>
        <p>Individual patients sign up, often on the Internet, and agree to pay for medical services with cash or a debit or credit card. They usually pay a small annual membership fee, and get an identification card that is accepted by a network of doctors, drugstores or other health care providers.</p>
        <p>The drugstores and other providers join the plans -- and accept the lower prices -- to reach more customers. And doctors, eager to avoid payment delays and restrictions when patients are using insurance, accept reduced fees comparable to those they receive from managed care companies.</p>
        <p>Because the services are so new, there are no firm statistics on how many people have signed up, or how many thousands of doctors are involved. But many self-employed people with little or no insurance find the new discounters particularly useful.</p>
        <p>Adria Firestone, a mezzo-soprano who lives in Jersey City, said her performers' union health plan became so expensive she could no longer afford full coverage. So when she needed bifocal contact lenses before a concert in Italy, she showed her card from a company called Medisavers to a participating Manhattan optometrist. As a Medisavers member, she paid $306.68 instead of the $475 retail price.</p>
        <p>David Wallen, a freelance entertainment writer in Los Angeles, saw a Web site operated by a company called HealthAllies soon after it began offering doctor's services last May. There was no charge to sign up. ''They negotiated rates for me with the internist and eye-ear-throat doctor I was already seeing,'' he said. ''It saved me half on my medical bills. It's great for people without health insurance.''</p>
        <p>Patients with insurance are using the new services as well. Patients trying to see a doctor outside their managed care network, or looking for a medical service their insurance does not cover, like acupuncture or cosmetic surgery, may now be able to find a lower price.</p>
        <p>''We are seeing a real phenomenon,'' said Gail Wilensky, a health care economist and former White House official. ''People are going to be able to shop and choose'' from a variety of medical services including ''individual providers and services they want.''</p>
        <p>The new programs are not specifically aimed at people of limited means who do not qualify for Medicaid, those often referred to as the working poor. The programs can stretch the buying power of people who can afford to pay for medical care -- including the one in 10 uninsured people who earn $50,000 a year or more.</p>
        <p>Making discounts on health care widely available ''is clearly a method for making the market work better,'' said Judith Lave, a professor of health economics at the University of Pittsburgh. ''We are clearly better off with them than without them.'' But she said the services would mainly attract patients who were relatively well off, so the discounts would not solve ''our macro problem'' -- the 45 million people without health insurance.</p>
        <p>Limited alternatives to employer-sponsored medical plans have existed for some time. AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, has long had a mail-order pharmacy for its members, for example. But the new companies can help people who do not have an employer or an organization to negotiate the lower discounts that are typically provided to groups.</p>
        <p>The most recent, HealthMarket, a start-up in Wilton, Conn., led by Stephen F. Wiggins, the former chief executive of Oxford Health Plans, began listing doctors on its Web site in late July and plans to add hospitals, dental and vision care and alternative medicine next month.</p>
        <p>Other small companies starting up or expanding discount medical services include HealthAllies, based in Glendale, Calif.; MedAdvantage in Southfield, Mich.; AmeriPlanUSA in Dallas; and Medisavers, which also offers health plans to a number of New York unions.</p>
        <p>There are larger companies entering the business as well. In June, the Reader's Digest Association joined with Medco, a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Company, to advertise drugstore discount cards and mail service to 50 million customers of Digest magazines, books and records, and says it may eventually offer other medical services as well.</p>
        <p>People who join YourxPlan, the Reader's Digest-Medco program, pay $25 a year, or $40 for a family, to get promised savings averaging 18 percent on brand-name drugs by mail order, and 11 percent at 40,000 participating pharmacies. Members can also check on prices or order refills on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Thomas O. Ryder, chairman of the Digest, said it started the business after conducting a survey of customers of its magazines, books and records. ''We discovered that around 20 million did not have drug coverage,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other people find the new services through professional organizations. Melissa Wahl, executive director of the National Association for Female Executives, said the organization was recommending HealthAllies to its 135,000 members, many of whom run small businesses with limited insurance benefits.</p>
        <p>Most of the new medical service companies hope to grow swiftly if the tight employment market eases, and if big companies begin to remodel health benefits the way they did when they replaced pensions with 401(k) plans. If companies make that change, employees would receive a set amount for their health-care needs instead of the relatively open-ended coverage they have now, and they would spend their own money if their costs exceeded the set amount.</p>
        <p>Already, employees are shouldering more of their health care costs. The percentage of employees with fully paid health coverage has dropped sharply under managed care. In 1998, 26.6 percent of Americans had fully paid care, compared to 45.5 percent in 1983, said James L. Medoff, a Harvard University economist who studied the trend for the Center for National Policy, a nonprofit research organization.</p>
        <p>Even the covered services in managed care are disappointing many patients. ''Health plans have so frustrated consumers that some of them are ready to reach in their pocket and spend money,'' said Karen Donelan, a public opinion expert at the Harvard School of Public Health.</p>
        <p>Bill McGahan, a health care industries investment banker at UBS Warburg said: ''Everybody hates the current system. Employers don't like it; physicians don't like it; employees don't like it.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, out-of-pocket spending on health care services is exploding, especially for drugs. Americans spent $199.5 billion of their own money on health care in 1998, by the government's latest count, up 38 percent since 1990.</p>
        <p>Of that amount, consumers spend $30 billion annually on alternative medical treatments like acupuncture, said Prof. Regina Herzlinger, a health care expert at the Harvard Business School. Professor Donelan said that a recent survey by Harris Interactive found that 15 to 20 percent of Americans who have health insurance were already spending their money for extras.</p>
        <p>To capture some of that spending, the online discount health plans offer services and products that many health plans do not cover, including expensive, heavily advertised drugs like Claritin for allergies, life-style products like Viagra for male impotence, and laser surgery to correct nearsightedness.</p>
        <p>Express Scripts said it was adding more than 500 members each week to several new drug card programs it started this summer with groups like Seniority America, which sells services to people over 50.</p>
        <p>As with much of what is available on the Web, the information provided by the new medical companies is not always screened for reliability or accuracy. The Web sites provide only limited information about the doctors in their programs, and many rely on outside organizations that have been approved by the National Committee for Quality Assurance to vet doctors' credentials.</p>
        <p>''Consumers on their own looking for quality information about doctors are at a real disadvantage,'' said Barry Scholl, a spokesman for the quality assurance committee, whose main function is to set standards and accredit managed care plans. Yesterday, legislation in California that would have regulated the discount companies was defeated. Consumer advocates and some medical groups said the law would have been too lax.</p>
        <p>At HealthAllies.com, the listings on doctors include their addresses, fees, the number of patients they see each day, and whether they are board certified in their specialties. The company promises savings of ''10 to 50 percent on the things insurance doesn't cover.''</p>
        <p>On HealthMarket, Mr. Wiggins's start-up, consumers can get information, including professional profiles of doctors, fees and full charges for dozens of treatments. Individuals pay $29 a year, $49 for families, plus a transaction fee for each service.</p>
        <p>Doctors said they liked the prompt frustration-free payments and increased patient flow. Dr. Stephen B. Meisel, a radiologist who is chief executive of Medfocus, a national chain of 1,800 medical imaging centers, said the services were ''a great idea.''</p>
        <p>''When we sign up with insurance companies or employers,'' he said, ''we give them a good value because they provide patient volume. We offer the same range of fees for HealthAllies.com. The patients are getting a big break.'' For example, he said, a magnetic resonance imaging scan, or M.R.I., in New York City would cost ''50 percent off the retail price.''</p>
