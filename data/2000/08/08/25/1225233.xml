        <p>Phillips Auctioneers, which began wine auctions in New York in 1998 and suspended them last December, said yesterday it would not resume them here in the fall wine auction season, which begins next month.</p>
        <p>Instead, Phillips plans to hold what may be the first in a series of auctions of rare and fine wine at Phillips-Selkirk, its St. Louis branch, beginning Nov. 18.</p>
        <p>Last November, Phillips, the world's third largest auction house after Sotheby's and Christie's, was bought by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury goods conglomerate. In December, LVMH put Manhattan wine auctions on hold.</p>
        <p>Phillips has concentrated on art auctions and on finding new headquarters in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Its international executive director, Dan Klein, said yesterday that the move to St. Louis was ''phase one of re-entering the whole wine auction field'' in America. ''We are not yet ready to relaunch a full wine commitment in New York, which I certainly would like to do,'' he added. ''At St. Louis, we have ideal premises; in New York, we are still looking for a permanent home.''</p>
