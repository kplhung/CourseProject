        <p>As state police divers searched for the bodies of two emotionally disturbed teenage boys who jumped into the Hudson River two days ago and disappeared, the family of one of the victims gathered near the river and prayed for the boy they presumed to be dead.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there is any use to pray for him to be alive,'' said Denise Peralta, 20, a cousin of one of the missing boys, Arimendis Lajara, 15. ''I mean, that is what we all wish, but we have to accept things.'' Ms. Peralta and other family members watched from Croton Point Park, where the boys had been camping, today as two police boats bobbed on the river.</p>
        <p>Twenty to 30 of the boy's relatives prayed aloud along the Hudson today, asking that his body be found so it can be buried. As they prayed, they threw bundles of flowers into the swift-moving water where he was last seen.</p>
        <p>The family of the other missing boy, Cedric Florence, 17, said they refused to give up hope that Cedric was still alive. Carlise Florence, Cedric's mother, said she was too distraught to stay in the park, where the boys had gone Monday for a three-day trip from a state psychiatric center in Brooklyn. She said she would return home to Brooklyn to await news of the search.</p>
        <p>Nearly 48 hours after the boys were swept away, the Westchester County police said that the operation had shifted from a rescue to a recovery effort because they believed it was not likely that either boy would be found alive. Late Wednesday, the United States Coast Guard also suspended rescue efforts, but Chief Brandon S. Brewer, a spokesman, said rescue efforts could resume if there was new information.</p>
        <p>''The police are going to continue the search, seven days a week, all day, until we locate the bodies,'' Susan Tolchin, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County executive, Andrew J. Spano, said.</p>
        <p>The county police continued an investigation into the incident, along with the State Office of Mental Health, which runs the Brooklyn Children's Psychiatric Center where the boys were living temporarily in a group home.</p>
        <p>The two missing boys and four others, all suffering from severe emotional disturbance, were staying with four counselors in cabins in the park.</p>
        <p>The boys and at least one counselor, Lennox Gabriel, 47, went to the river's edge at about 3 p.m. on Tuesday. Mr. Gabriel told the police that he led the boys down a steep path at Teller's Point as part of a hiking expedition, not to swim, said Sgt. Donald F. McArthur, a spokesman for the Westchester County police.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gabriel and other counselors had been warned twice that swimming was off limits in the park. The treacherous route led to the spot where the Hudson and Croton Rivers meet in a swirling confluence.</p>
        <p>Once there, three boys jumped into the water. One of them swam back to shore and Mr. Gabriel jumped in after the other two, the police said. Mr. Gabriel had to be rescued.</p>
        <p>Roger Klingman, a spokesman for the State Office of Mental Health, said interviews with the children and all four counselors on the trip were continuing. He said no complaints had ever been filed against Mr. Gabriel, who managed the Brooklyn group home. The police are treating the disappearances as an accident.</p>
        <p>''If an investigation turns up anything -- that proper procedures were not followed or that there were errors in judgment, then a disciplinary process ensues,'' Mr. Klingman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gabriel, who was released from the hospital late Wednesday, would not comment today.</p>
        <p>''The first time I was here I could see how dangerous it was,'' said Frankie Lajara, 20, Arimendis's brother, as he crouched above the rocky path to the water. ''Yesterday, I believed he was alive. But today, I really can't say something like that.''</p>
