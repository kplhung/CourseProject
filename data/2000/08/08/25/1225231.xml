        <p>Offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott, newly out of retirement, got a small bit of good news yesterday: his two-game suspension by the National Football League for his role in a bar fight last summer was reduced to one game. Elliott, who is now the Jets' backup left tackle, will miss the season opener at Green Bay and will not be paid for that week, losing a total of $29,411.76.</p>
        <p>Elliott, who pleaded guilty to two violations, contended in his appeal that because he had not been convicted of a misdemeanor or a felony, he should not be punished under the league's violent crime policy. But Elliott said he sensed that the league was unlikely to reverse his suspension after the N.F.L. fined Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis $250,000 last week.</p>

        <p>Offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott, newly out of retirement, got a small bit of good news yesterday: his two-game suspension by the National Football League for his role in a bar fight last summer was reduced to one game. Elliott, who is now the Jets' backup left tackle, will miss the season opener at Green Bay and will not be paid for that week, losing a total of $29,411.76.</p>
        <p>Elliott, who pleaded guilty to two violations, contended in his appeal that because he had not been convicted of a misdemeanor or a felony, he should not be punished under the league's violent crime policy. But Elliott said he sensed that the league was unlikely to reverse his suspension after the N.F.L. fined Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis $250,000 last week.</p>
        <p>Lewis, whose fine was the largest nonsuspension fine ever levied by the league office, pleaded guilty in June to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of law enforcement officers and interference with a law enforcement investigation, after he was charged with murder in the death of two men outside an Atlanta club hours after the Super Bowl last January.</p>
        <p>Elliott will not be allowed to practice from the time the Jets make their final cuts, which must come by Sunday, until the day after the team opens its season at Green Bay on Sept. 3.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad it was reduced,'' Elliott said. ''I'm appreciative of that. But the way the court adjudicated the case, I was hoping for a lot better result. But given the recent atmosphere, you get thrown in with other names and wild stuff that's been going on. I'm a realist. I went into it expecting something along these lines.''</p>
        <p>The one-week suspension will stall Elliott's comeback from retirement and off-season back surgery. But Elliott has been pleased with his progress so far, and said he had felt strange when training camp began and he was still at home.</p>

        <p>BILLS 16, EAGLES 12: Donovan McNabb spent most of the night wearing a baseball cap and Rob Johnson didn't even dress for the game.</p>
        <p>It was an uneventful evening for the starting quarterbacks as Buffalo beat host Philadelphia, 16-12, last night in the preseason finale for both teams.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia's Donovan McNabb was on the field for just four plays, completed one pass and threw an interception. Rob Johnson, meanwhile, wore shorts, stood on the sidelines and joked around with teammates.</p>
        <p>Alex Van Pelt, Johnson's replacement, was 15 of 28 for 163 yards, and the rookie Sammy Morris ran for 101 yards and one touchdown to lead the Bills. (AP)</p>
        <p>PATRIOTS 29, PANTHERS 21: In an experimental role as a short-yardage quarterback, Michael Bishop relieved Drew Bledsoe and ran for a touchdown to lead host New England Patriots to victory.</p>
        <p>Cornerback Otis Smith intercepted a pass to set up another touchdown and added a sack -- just one day after he was signed by the Patriots (3-2). The Panthers (0-4) also finished the 1997 preseason 0-4 before going 7-9 in the regular season. (AP)</p>
        <p>FALCONS 31, JAGUARS 20: Host Jacksonville's starting offense got another sobering dose of reality in its loss to Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Chris Chandler connected with Terance Mathis on a pretty 37-yard scoring play as the Falcons (4-1) closed their preseason with a victory and a confidence boost for their hurting defense.</p>
        <p>Mark Brunell of Jacksonville (3-1) completed all five of his passes for 111 yards. But he took a beating behind a line that struggled, even when Tony Boselli, recovering from a knee injury, was in for his first 10 snaps of the preseason. (AP)</p>
        <p>COLTS 32, VIKINGS 30: The rookie Jamel White rushed for one touchdown and returned a kickoff 96 yards for another, and Danny Kight kicked a 43-yard field goal as the game ended to lead host Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>Minnesota (1-3) took the lead with just over a minute to go on a 4-yard pass from the backup Bubby Brister to Matthew Hatchette. But a 48-yard kickoff return by the rookie Payton Williams and a roughing-the-passer penalty on the Vikings' Lemanski Hall took Indianapolis (3-2) to the Minnesota 28.</p>
        <p>Jim Finn ran 2 yards, and three plays later Kight kicked the winning field goal. (AP)</p>
