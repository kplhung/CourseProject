        <p>Frank Sinatra is singing ''Blue Skies'' as my 80-something cousin Ceil Merritt changes from her sensible street shoes into a pair of metallic gold strappy heels. They could be Cinderella's slippers. For in the next hour and a half she will be transported from the world of a senior with her share of aches and pains to that of a fairy princess, dancing waltzes, tangos and rumbas with a series of princely partners.</p>
        <p>Ceil is a regular at the weekly ''Dance Evenings Elegante,'' held on Thursday nights in the social hall of an Upper East Side church and on alternate Saturday evenings at the Roseland 2000 ballroom, a converted garage in Nutley, N.J. At these events, no one stands longingly on the sidelines hoping to be asked to dance, and no one suffers partners who don't know a mambo from a merengue. With twice as many female dancers as male dancers, the women dance every other dance, with a chance to rest in between. For the women who participate, this is dance heaven.</p>
        <p>The private dance parties are the invention of Stan Martin, a magical dancer who began holding them in 1962. As a dance director at a studio, he was frequently asked by students to continue their lessons in dance clubs, at their expense. Happily married, he turned them down, but he then consented to accompany two women at once, and dance alternately with them. To the sounds of Guy Lombardo and his orchestra at the Roosevelt Grill, the women had a fabulous time.</p>
        <p>Before long, others asked to join, and Mr. Martin, whom everyone calls Stan, approached another dance instructor about joining them. The group multiplied quickly, maintaining its 2:1 ratio. When the Roosevelt Grill closed, they moved to the Savoy Plaza, and when that was slated for demolition, they tried the Manhattan Room of the Hotel New Yorker, the Promenade at Rockefeller Center, the St. Regis roof and the Hotel Taft.</p>
        <p>''As we opened our doors, the hotels closed theirs,'' Stan explained. For more than 30 years, with Peter Jones, also a former dance-studio director, as his business partner, they ran the evenings at Roseland on West 52nd Street. When the ballroom limited its hours, they shifted to private clubs and then to their present home at St. Jean Baptiste Roman Catholic Church at Lexington Avenue and 76th Street. In a high-ceilinged chamber on the church's lower level, the 20 or so women greet one another like old friends. Made up with care, most wear dresses with color and flair. Adjacent to pillars at the far end of the room, four tables are set with plastic tablecloths and cups for water, with each woman's place marked with a small envelope hand-lettered with her name, for the evening's fee.</p>
        <p>The single artificial flower at the center of each table becomes a lush bouquet as the music and dancing begin, and the makeshift dance hall becomes a palace ballroom in the not-too-distant dreams of the participants. Elegante, indeed.</p>
        <p>Several of the women are in their 80's, although the participants ranged widely in age, with the youngest in her 30's. A lot of years of dancing -- and a lot of stories -- percolate in the room. Some women have been dancing all their lives, and others began recently, perhaps after some family tragedy or a New Year's resolution to learn to tango. ''I call this my mental health night,'' a nursing supervisor said.</p>
        <p>Many of the women are widows who found these evenings to be a way to transcend their loss and solve the practical problem of lacking a dance partner. One notes that her doctor suggested dancing as exercise, and more than one mentions that her psychiatrist sent her. A marketing executive in her 50's said that dancing fed her soul; an author said that it engaged her mind. For many, it is the highlight of the week.</p>
        <p>Over the years the group has included songwriters, editors, lawyers, a Rockette, wives of well-known men and a woman named Rose who danced until she was 98 and was buried in her dance shoes. Today, Eleanor Carlucci, 79, has the longest tenure, having danced with the group for 35 years. She was Alfred A. Knopf's secretary in the last years of his life and still works part time as the librarian for Random House. She walks with a cane. But when the music starts, the cane's on the sidelines, and she's in step and in the swing.</p>
        <p>The teachers' ages also vary, from the 20's to the 80's. (Some of the women and teachers will no sooner divulge their age than have a woman lead.) Robert Vance, one of the youngest teachers, said that dancing was ''ageless.'' One of the most senior, Johnnie Rossi, 76, a World War II veteran, has had two replacements in one knee. When I asked one of the women to identify the music being played, she said, ''You can always tell by looking at Johnnie's hips.'' He moves with remarkable grace and spirit.</p>
        <p>For the teachers, all independent instructors, the parties offer an opportunity to attract new clients, although they're not allowed to solicit. Some give private lessons before and after the session, which runs from 8 to 9:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>There's nothing random about these evenings. The women at the two tables on the left dance while those on the right sit out, and then they switch. Always wearing jackets and ties, the teachers come to collect their partners in the 10 seconds between songs -- taking their arm to lead them to the dance floor. They follow a precise order of rotation, so that by the end of the evening, every woman will have danced several times with every teacher, doing different dances with each one.</p>
        <p>''Who's my next gentleman caller?,'' Bel Kaufman joked, rising to wait for her partner. Ms. Kaufman, the 89-year old author of ''Up the Down Staircase,'' especially loves dramatic dances like the tango and pasa doble, and dances with flourish. ''It can be intimidating the first time,'' she said. ''We all look like we're wonderful dancers. We're not. We dance with wonderful dancers. But we're improving.'' She looks wonderful.</p>
        <p>People who happen upon the social hall and peek in are often puzzled. Something about the dancers' mixed ages and appearances suggest that these aren't married couples. Yet they waltz and cha-cha with the familiarity of people who've known each other for years, sometimes laughing and chatting, sometimes looking at each other in a locked, silent gaze as they glide together with seeming ease. It looks like a tea dance, reborn. Or, take away the walls and it could be a scene on the deck of a cruise ship.</p>
        <p>On the polished dance floor of Roseland 2000, Stan's group danced amid the New Jersey crowd, all their gestures reflected in the mirrored wall. From 9 to 11 p.m. they follow their usual rotating format. Without a doubt, Stan is the best dancer in the room, and he makes whoever he is  dancing with look splendid too. He and his wife, Judie, had been a professional adagio team -- a dance form where the man lifts the woman up high -- and performed internationally but retired 10 years ago after an injury. With the women in this group, he lifts only their spirits.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of a Saturday session, Ceil is doing a variation on the merengue with a bit of hustle, and her partner, George, drops to his knees and dances around her. Not missing a beat, she continues her steps, raising her arms and waving them to the music. It is a tour de force; they are applauded as they conclude in an embrace. ''Sometimes I like to show off,'' she admits later.</p>
        <p>One evening when there was a no-show and the teachers had a gap on their dance cards, I was invited to dance. I demurred, saying I didn't have the right shoes, but I was gently prodded to give it a whirl. I did a tango with Peter, a mambo with Stan  and then moved through some stylish fox-trot quick and slow combinations with Robert. Hey, I could do this. I was floating. But I was  brought down to earth when a regular guy asked me to dance at Roseland 2000 and our arms pretzeled instead of looping when we turned. So part of the charm of this brigade of princes is that they lead powerfully but don't make you feel as if they're propelling you into place although, clearly, at times they are.</p>
        <p>About leading, Peter, who is 6 foot 3 and athletic-looking, and the most professorial of the bunch, said, it was  an ''imperceptible art, like a magician's sleight of hand.'' He explained that he ''shifts gears'' for each partner. For some of the women, who are totally in charge in their professional lives or have lived on their own for so long that they're accustomed to making the rules, learning to follow rather than lead is an acquired skill. ''To suddenly think of myself as submissive is one of the hardest things,'' a magazine publisher said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps one of the reasons so many participants view ballroom dance as healing is because of its quality of touch. It's one of the few activities in which physical contact is permitted among people who don't know each other well. But it's a touch that can be tender and communicative without being intimate, even as the partners hold each other and move as one. That distance provides a layer of comfort and dignity that enable the women to lose themselves in the dance.</p>
        <p>Ballroom dance is the rare fantasy that's easily lived out: with stirring music and a talented partner, it's not much of a leap to imagine being elsewhere, in another time, or being in love. To watch these women dance is to feel the romance, the possibility, the transformation and the fun of it all.</p>
        <p>''When I arrive and descend those steps, I hold onto the banister, aware of my age,'' Ms. Kaufman said.  ''When I leave, I run up the stairs. I'm 18 again, no matter how tired. I'm exhilarated.''</p>
        <p>When the evening's final song ends, the women complain about the time going by too quickly. Most could have danced all night.</p>
