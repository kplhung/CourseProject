        <p>The city acted legally last year when it refused to allow an air charter company to fly tour groups from the seaplane base at East 23rd Street, a federal judge ruled this week.</p>
        <p>The charter company, SeaAir NY, had claimed that the city's restrictions violated a 1994 federal law that limits the ability of local governments to impose restrictions on air carriers. SeaAir claimed that the city violated that law last year when it would not issue a permit allowing the tours.</p>
        <p>But Judge John S. Martin Jr. of the United States District Court in Manhattan, ruled that the federal law did not apply to SeaAir because it was acting as a tour company, not an air carrier, and that the city had acted reasonably when it decided to forbid air tours from the seaplane base. The ruling, on Monday, was first reported in The New York Law Journal.</p>
        <p>SeaAir began flying seaplane tours from the 23rd Street base in March 1999. The city owns the base and annually licenses a private company to manage it. When city officials reissued the license in August 1999, they said that commercial air tours would no longer be allowed.</p>
        <p>Deborah Rand, the lawyer for the city, said city officials did so because they wanted to decrease the number of flights from the base to lessen noise in the area. She said the city decided that tours should be eliminated before charter flights.</p>
        <p>''We want flights that are transportation-related,'' Ms. Rand said. ''If you have to make a choice, the choice should be transportation.''</p>
        <p>In addition to ruling that a company conducting tours did not qualify as an air carrier under federal law, Judge Martin rejected the company's claim that the city violated its constitutional right to due legal process by the unreasonable denial of its permit. The judge said the city's decision to reduce noise by restricting seaplane service to transportation flights rather than tours was well within the city's legal responsibility.</p>
        <p>''The city made a perfectly rational decision that transportation flights are more beneficial to the community as a whole than sightseeing flights,'' he wrote. ''This decision was well within the city's police powers and in no way violated due process.''</p>
        <p>The judge also denied other constitutional claims made by the company, in part because he said the city had not prevented SeaAir from operating at another location.</p>
        <p>''All of these arguments ignore the fact that the city has not prohibited SeaAir from engaging in any of its operations,'' he wrote, ''it has simply refused to allow SeaAir to use city property to carry on these activities.''</p>
        <p>A lawyer for SeaAir did not return a call yesterday seeking comment.</p>
