        <p>The street was wide open, with more lanes than cars, on a quiet afternoon here in Nigeria's shiny new capital. But somehow, Usman Muhammad, an excitable 28-year-old taxi driver, had gotten into a fight with a Peugeot immediately recognizable as a government-owned car.</p>
        <p>''Government drivers, they are useless! Criminals!'' Mr. Muhammad yelled, nearly colliding his jalopy with the Peugeot. ''My friend, why are you driving rough?''</p>

        <p>The street was wide open, with more lanes than cars, on a quiet afternoon here in Nigeria's shiny new capital. But somehow, Usman Muhammad, an excitable 28-year-old taxi driver, had gotten into a fight with a Peugeot immediately recognizable as a government-owned car.</p>
        <p>''Government drivers, they are useless! Criminals!'' Mr. Muhammad yelled, nearly colliding his jalopy with the Peugeot. ''My friend, why are you driving rough?''</p>
        <p>The Peugeot stopped at an intersection, where Mr. Muhammad's ''friend'' promptly used his right hand to form the equivalent of the Nigerian finger. ''This Abuja,'' Mr. Muhammad said, somewhat deflated, ''they are all driving rough.''</p>
        <p>He perked up, though, on seeing a Toyoto Corolla, which he has long coveted. ''Once I buy that car,'' he said, ''I go marry my wife.'' He would have it made, as he explained in Nigerian English: ''Big man don come.''</p>
        <p>The biggest of the big men, President Clinton, is to arrive on Saturday in Abuja, a city that has long been home to government rough drivers and ordinary Nigerians with big dreams. Nigeria decided to move its capital from Lagos and create a new one a quarter of a century ago. But it was only in the last decade that the government moved here and Abuja grew from a town to be the capital of Africa's most populous nation.</p>
        <p>The concentration of so many new government buildings, new villas, new hotels, new cars on new roads, in a country where every other city seems to teeter on collapse, has long fueled visitors' imagination, sometimes in unexpected ways. For example, the troubles in the oil-producing Niger Delta were said to have grown in recent years after youths from the region came here. Gaping at the gleaming new capital the country's oil had built, they returned to their villages with a militancy that has since pushed the delta to the brink of civil war.</p>
        <p>Lagos -- a city that many Nigerians regard with the same kind of awe and loathing with which many Americans view New York -- was abandoned as the capital because it was too crowded, too dangerous, too closely linked to the Yoruba, the main ethnic group in the area. In a nation riven with ethnic cleavages, a new capital in a neutral zone, geographically in the center of the country, was needed, a symbolic home for all Nigerians. Abuja was born.</p>
        <p>Still, telltale signs of the dominance by Nigeria's Muslim northerners dot Abuja. The new National Assembly building looks like a mosque. A gold-domed mosque sits in the middle of the city, not far from an unfinished church.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton will spend his two days in Nigeria here with his host, President Olusegun Obasanjo. American officials rejected visits to the north and south, partly for security reasons, partly for political ones. Calls to the north and southeast would have angered those in the southwest. Any visit to a city other than Abuja would have been a slight to Lagos.</p>
        <p>And so Mr. Clinton will remain stuck in the neutral zone that is Abuja.</p>
        <p>In Lagos, whose residents look down on Abuja the same way New Yorkers do on Washington, the news came as a shock. If Abuja knows how to build beautiful roads, Lagos knows how to party. There is fine pepper soup in every neighborhood restaurant, the best musicians from the region, enough thrills to provide plenty of what some English-speaking West Africans call ''life enjoyment.''</p>
        <p>There is not much life enjoyment here in Abuja, which becomes a ghost town on weekends when politicians leave to visit their villages.</p>
        <p>''By leaving Lagos out of Clinton's itinerary, it's a big mistake,'' said James Uloko, 39, who works in public relations in, naturally, Lagos. ''From Lagos, you can see all the colors of life in this country.''</p>
        <p>At a market here, Sylvester Ebere said he did not want any of that color. ''I like Abuja for security reasons,'' he said, acknowledging that he had never set foot in Lagos.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ebere, 23, moved to Abuja two weeks ago, looking for job opportunities he has yet to find. He said he had worked as a gardener for a British-owned company in Kaduna.</p>
        <p>For now he is living with his brother, Joel, 28. They were selling products like skin cream , and share a $7-a-month cubicle on Abuja's outskirts.</p>
        <p>Housing is the hardest part of living here, said Tony Njoku, 42, a businessman, who paid about $300 a year for a two-bedroom apartment 45 minutes from Abuja. Something comparable in the city itself could cost $2,500. ''No common man is able to rent here,'' said Mr. Njoku, who moved here in the late 1980's when Abuja's population was around 15,000. Now it is an estimated 400,000.</p>
        <p>It was in 1991 that Nigeria's former military ruler, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, formally transplanted the capital here, some months after surviving a coup attempt in Lagos. Since then, in this country whose economy still depends almost entirely on the government, the center of gravity has shifted here.</p>
        <p>Ibrahim Muhammad, 55, said he had come to Abuja for years to support his two wives and 23 children back home in the northern state of Jigawa.</p>
        <p>''I usually go to some big men from my area, who are in government jobs, to ask for contracts,'' Mr. Muhammad said, explaining that he then sold the contracts -- to clean a road here or to cater some food there -- to a third party for a markup.</p>
        <p>''But things are very difficult now,'' he said, adding that President Obasanjo's administration had cracked down on the freewheeling spending. ''The officials no longer want to see us. They now prefer to give contracts to their girlfriends. You can hardly see them inside their cars with dark tinted windows.''</p>
