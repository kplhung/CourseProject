        <p>If George W. Bush were a ''Survivor'' contestant, he would have been Kelly, who made it to the finals with her ability to recall the details of her former teammates' family histories.</p>
        <p>Really, the man can run into somebody he met 15 years ago for five minutes in a hotel lobby and you'd have thought they roomed together at prep school. This may not be the most important talent in the universe, but it's surprisingly rare in the male of the species.</p>
        <p>''I had no idea what your wife's name is. Isn't that interesting?'' exclaimed Richard, the eventual ''Survivor'' winner, to another contestant  with whom he had spent 39 long, intense and occasionally naked days.</p>
        <p>The fact that Richard went home with the $1 million has caused many Americans to question the existence of a benevolent deity, and we will not be so cruel as to suggest that if Al Gore had been on the island, he would have been Richard. But Mr. Gore did tell the Democratic convention that he was not concerned about being lovable. This came after four days of continuous effort to convince the nation that the vice president was adorable as all get-out, and was therefore a very Richard thing to do.</p>
        <p>Many people seem to feel they have gotten a real education in the downside of the human character from ''Survivor.'' The show didn't have an equivalent to Nick Bateman, the archvillain of the British version of ''Big Brother,'' who attempted to win the support of his fellow contestants by telling them that his nonexistent wife had been tragically killed in a car crash. The tabloid press urged that helicopters be used to drop leaflets warning the housebound competitors about the viper in their midst. When ''Nasty Nick'' was evicted for cheating last week, The Sun, which had led the campaign against him, swiftly hired him as a columnist.</p>
        <p>But we digress. The subject at hand is whether the ''Survivor'' mania can teach us any lessons about the current presidential race.</p>
        <p>There were some similarities. The ''Survivor'' finale went on way too long, much like this political season, which seems to stretch back to the Battle of Hastings. The ''Survivor'' jurors all wound up protesting that they hated both the candidates and didn't want to vote for anybody, which certainly sounds familiar.</p>
        <p>And weirdly, as the show wound down, the contestants began talking a little like Mr. Bush. The people on the island had the advantage of some careful editing, but you still couldn't help noting that a lot of them tended to rush verbally forward, stringing words together without much concern for where the trail was taking them. (One convoluted rationale by a Richard supporter concluded with the announcement that ''Kelly was more double-faced.'')</p>
        <p>Like Kelly, Mr. Bush has had a not-great week. Mr. Gore is rising in the polls. There's a growing suspicion that the public is never going to embrace the $1.3 trillion tax cut that sits like a great wart in the middle of the Bush agenda. And on Monday, the candidate delivered a speech that connoisseurs of Bushian malapropisms regarded as a four-star keeper.</p>
        <p>''We cannot let terrorists and rogue nations hold this nation hostile or hold our allies hostile,'' he told an Iowa fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>He also promised to ''work to end terrors -- tariffs and barriers,'' and to bring an end to ''four years of Clinton-Gore.'' His attempts to defend the tax cut were marred by an unfortunate tendency to mix up billions and trillions. As a finale, Mr. Bush assured the audience that victory was theirs because ''we're talking about issues in a way the American people can understand.''</p>
        <p>Later, after vowing to do a better job of explaining the tax cut to average voters, he proceeded to give a disquisition that even the above-average national correspondents on his press plane found bewildering.</p>
        <p>Tired politicians always tend to mess up their syntax. Unfortunately, Mr. Bush's Iowa speech came after he had taken a day off the trail to return to Austin, for a schedule in which the word ''nap'' figured prominently.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Mr. Bush can turn all this to his advantage. The babbling thing seems to be spreading, and Americans may prefer a president who would not look down on them if they forgot to insert verbs in their sentences. They might conclude that at least he's not, you know, like, double-faced.</p>
