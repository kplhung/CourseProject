        <p>How big is Gov. George W. Bush's proposed tax cut? There is no single answer.</p>
        <p>Over the first nine years that the program could be in effect starting in the 2002 fiscal year, the first to begin after Mr. Bush would take office, the tax cut is estimated by Congress's nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee to reduce federal revenue by about $1.3 trillion.</p>
        <p>But tax cuts are sometimes described in terms of their effect not just on revenues, but on how much of the projected budget surplus they would consume. The surplus projections assume that all excess federal revenue would go to reducing the national debt. If any of the surplus is spent or used for tax cuts, the debt would be reduced by a lesser amount. As a result, the government would have to pay more interest on the debt than it would if all the surplus had gone to debt reduction.</p>
        <p>In the case of a $1.3 trillion tax cut, the government's interest bill would be roughly $300 billion higher over nine years than if there were no tax cut. So it would also be fair to say that Mr. Bush's tax cut would use $1.6 trillion of the surplus.</p>
        <p>But there's a wrinkle. Major tax and spending programs are usually described in terms of their costs over 10 years, not nine. In the 10 years starting in 2002, Mr. Bush's tax plan would reduce revenue by about $1.6 trillion. If the interest effect were added, the 10-year reduction in the budget surplus would be about $1.9 trillion.</p>
        <p>Of course, the same standards could be applied to Vice President Al Gore's proposals. The Gore campaign describes his plan as a $500 billion tax cut over 10 years starting in 2001. (For the sake of argument, Mr. Gore assumes that his tax cut would start next year, so the cost of the cut can be matched against the current 10-year surplus projection.)</p>
        <p>If the interest component were included, it would be a $620 billion tax cut. But Mr. Gore has also proposed spending just over $1 trillion of the surplus. His campaign calculates that the overall tax and spending plan would have an interest cost of $247 billion over 10 years, meaning that Mr. Gore would use nearly $1.8 trillion of the surplus.</p>
