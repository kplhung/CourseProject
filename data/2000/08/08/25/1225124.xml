        <p>In three successive primary elections, Kimon C. Thermos campaigned vigorously -- and unsuccessfully -- to become the first Greek-American elected from New York City to the Assembly. Mr. Thermos, a lawyer and the president of a Democratic club in Queens, lost the last two contests by razor-thin margins to Assemblyman Denis J. Butler.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Butler is retiring after 24 years in Albany. And the 36th Assembly District, anchored in Astoria, Queens, is likely to elect a Greek-American assemblyman this year. But it is by no means a certainty that Mr. Thermos will fill that Assembly seat. He must first face a contentious primary battle with Michael N. Gianaris, a lawyer who has worked as a counsel to the Assembly in Albany.</p>
        <p>Along the bustling commercial thoroughfares of Astoria there is the unmistakable ambience of an energetic and highly competitive campaign. Posters of one candidate or the other are on the windows of virtually every storefront, and the candidates themselves seem to cross each other's paths on their way to meet voters at subway stations and civic association meetings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thermos has extensive experience in organizing a formidable campaign: he lost by just 265 votes to the incumbent assemblyman in 1998. But Mr. Thermos did not win many friends in the Queens Democratic organization with his three challenges of the Democratic incumbent. His opponent this year, Mr. Gianaris, has the backing of nearly all of the party officials in the area, from the Queens borough president, Claire Shulman, and the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, to Mr. Butler himself.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Thermos has the support of some labor groups. And both candidates are spending heavily, with Mr. Thermos expected to spend about $120,000 by the primary election on Sept. 12, and Mr. Gianaris $175,000.</p>
        <p>The candidates seem to have much in common. They are young -- Mr. Thermos is 34 and Mr. Gianaris is 30. Both have lived in Astoria most of their lives and both are lawyers. Mr. Thermos is a graduate of St. John's University Law School and Mr. Gianaris is a graduate of Harvard Law School. And they both became active in politics during the presidential campaign of Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in 1988 and the first Greek-American presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>On the major issues, there seems to be almost carbon-copy agreement. Each candidate supports measures to deliver more state money to the New York City school system, particularly for the construction of new schools to relieve overcrowding. Both men speak passionately about their opposition to plans to expand power plants in the district.</p>
        <p>Still, the candidates are quick to point out what they see as the differences between them. Mr. Thermos, for example, tells voters that he has a deeper commitment to the community than his opponent and cites the anti-graffiti and park cleaning activities in which he participated before he ran for office.</p>
        <p>''I'm running on my community service record,'' Mr. Thermos said. ''I didn't just come in here and run for office without having been involved in this community. I have a long history of involvement here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gianaris, in turn, criticizes his opponent as being a less-than-committed Democrat. He complains about Mr. Thermos's endorsement of Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, instead of his Democratic rival in the 1998 governor's race, Mr. Vallone. And he accused the Thermos campaign of having Republican leaders in significant fund-raising positions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gianaris's harshest criticisms center on what he calls his opponent's lack of leadership. And he accuses Mr. Thermos of having waged campaigns in the past that have pitted the Greek community against other ethnic groups in the district. ''To appeal specifically to one group is divisive, particularly in a diverse community like this,'' Mr. Gianaris said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thermos denies that he has been divisive in appealing for votes. ''We don't distinguish between people,'' he said. ''I urge everyone to vote. And I do speak Greek and I ask people who are Greek to vote. But there is nothing divisive about that.''</p>
        <p>The 36th Assembly District is a working-class area where ethnic politics has long played an important role. Greek-Americans account for about 30 percent of the district, and Jewish, Italian- and Irish-American residents make up another 30 percent. Hispanic residents account for 20 percent of the district, which also has a growing population of immigrants from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p>
        <p>Because the seat is open, with no incumbent, Queens Democrats insist that it is unclear which candidate has the advantage. Both candidates are leaders in prominent Democratic clubs in Astoria with large cadres of volunteers.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the race represents a war between their two clubs, which are separated by just a few blocks along 23rd Avenue. Several years ago, Mr. Thermos formed a power base by reviving the Aldos Independent Democratic Organization. Mr. Gianaris is a member of the Taminent Regular Democratic Club, which counts Mr. Vallone and State Senator George Onorato among its members.</p>
        <p>Both men are running campaign commercials on Greek-language cable television stations and have placed ads in Greek newspapers.</p>
        <p>In the end, both candidates insist, the result will hinge on who has done a better job in bringing his core supporters to the polls. ''We're facing a formidable machine and they are working harder than they did for Denis Butler,'' Mr. Thermos said. ''But I think we're doing well. After running so many times before, there are a lot of people who at least recognize me now. And that helps.''</p>
