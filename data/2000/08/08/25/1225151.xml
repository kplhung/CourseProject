        <p>In the last 10 years, Urszula Malinowska and her husband have transformed their lives, turning a tiny farm and orchard into a wood-processing factory that employs 35 people.</p>
        <p>In 1991, after failed farming ventures, they bought a used American machine to cut timber, a Wood-Mizer, and created a business of turning timber into lumber for the building boom that has transformed this area near Mszczonow, some 35 miles southwest of Warsaw.</p>
        <p>Now, they have $500,000 a year in revenue, produce their own power and heat from the waste wood and sawdust, and are planning a more modern plant to work on more expensive woods for higher-profit furniture.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Malinowska, at 48, could be a billboard for the new market economy that has taken hold in Poland, the largest and most successful economic transformation in central Europe. She is the active boss of one of two million small and medium-sized private enterprises in a country of 42 million people.</p>
        <p>But like many Poles, she is not especially happy with the way things are, and she is likely to vote for the reformed Communists of the Democratic Left Alliance in parliamentary elections expected next spring, dumping the more conservative Solidarity alliance.</p>
        <p>To Mrs. Malinowska, the changes have come with mixed blessings. ''The great satisfaction is that we've built something new, and without permission from anyone,'' she said, as her workers took large pine logs and began to turn them into lumber.</p>
        <p>''As owners, there is a great feeling of responsibility, and we work from 6 to 6,'' she added. ''But there is a sense of achieving one's goals.''</p>
        <p>Still, she said, ''there are lots of problems.'' Small businesses don't get much help from the state; the tax laws are complicated and contradictory; there is an effective state monopoly on the supply of lumber, given the difficulties of trade with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus; and with Poland still outside the European Union and membership probably four years away, she feels that ''our Western partners take advantage of our weaknesses.''</p>
        <p>The sourness is widely felt by Poles, whose rapid progress is nonetheless falling behind their own expectations. While young people are full of confidence, many Poles still have a deep fear of being marginalized, of falling behind, both as individuals and as a nation striving to join the rest of Europe as an equal, said Jacek Kucharczyk, deputy director of the Institute of Public Affairs, an independent Polish research organization.</p>
        <p>''Poland is a country doing better than it feels -- it's doing better than it thinks it's doing,'' Mr. Kucharczyk said. Polls show that more than 50 percent of Poles think it's a better country than 10 years ago, and only 30 percent disagree, he said.</p>
        <p>But change is still frightening to those who are over 40. And the current Solidarity government's big reforms -- to decentralize and streamline health care, education, pensions and provincial administration -- have caused enormous anxiety.</p>
        <p>With more to lose, there is also a growing concern about personal safety and crime, and a feeling that the police are not keeping up with the problem.</p>
        <p>Even the prospect of joining the European Union has raised considerable fear -- not just among the many farmers who fear European competition, but also among those who worry that Poland will give up some of its precious identity, after centuries of struggle to shape and preserve it.</p>
        <p>What is the Polish nightmare? ''To be the Mexico of Germany: proud, important, too big to fail, but deeply unbalanced next to a neighbor that is too rich and too big,'' one European ambassador said.</p>
        <p>Poles are more pessimistic these days, said Halina Binczak, economics editor of the respected daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita. In polls, only about 8 percent of Poles think the reforms are going well. Five years ago, she said, 60 percent of households had trouble making ends meet. Today, it's some 40 percent. ''Yet five years ago, people were more optimistic than now,'' she said. ''Our aspirations are rising faster than our possibilities. People are less satisfied with what they have, even though they have more.''</p>
        <p>Yet the signs of new prosperity are all over Poland. In Mszczonow, a small town of some 6,000, there are scores of new shops -- bakeries, groceries, hardware stores, hairdressers -- that did not exist 10 years ago. The town has streetlights now, put up four years ago. A special kind of apple is being grown by farmers that feeds good, tart concentrate into blended juices; there is one large industrial park, called Europark, already in operation, with another soon to open.</p>
        <p>On this main route near Warsaw, there are hundreds of trucks from all over Europe and the former Soviet Union. Servicing them are large gas stations, looking like modern palaces, with their cafes and small grocery stores attached. (And in a sign of the growing traffic, numerous prostitutes line up at intervals along the roadway.)</p>
        <p>The roads are crammed with new cars. Poles have bought more than 500,000 new cars each year for the last four years, reflecting the prosperity and an explosion in consumer credit, but posing dangers for more inflation, already at 11.6 percent in July, a two-year high.</p>
        <p>And they use their cars to shop at huge supermarket complexes in the suburbs, where Ikea rubs up against  KFC and McDonald's and Carrefour and Geant superstores.</p>
        <p>But for all this wealth, the infrastructure lags far behind. Warsaw traffic is bad, and there is barely a subway system, with only one short line. The telephone system, reluctantly changing from a state monopoly, is inefficient, compared with the Czech Republic's or even Romania's, and expensive.</p>
        <p>There are few highways, and the two-lane roads -- effectively three-lane, with expensive cars zooming around buses, trucks and the little old Polski Fiats that can't go much over 60 miles an hour -- are often seamed and channeled, with heavy traffic punishing roadbeds built for less booming times.</p>
        <p>Road fatalities are consequently a major issue, with large green and black signs displaying the number of dead and injured at particularly bad spots. A billboard campaign shows wrecked cars with large, one-word slogans: ''Autoagresja'' and ''Autodestrukcja.''</p>
        <p>Like its roads, Poland's politics are messy and crowded, still driven by the ideologies of the battle, 20 years ago, against Communism: Reformed Communists versus the Solidarity coalition, which itself is a very broad church of some 30 parties. Although its roots are in a trade union, Solidarity is center-right in politics. Some of the best-known intellectuals associated with Solidarity, like Bronislaw Geremek, the historian and former foreign minister, formed the Freedom Union, further to the right. And then there are farmers' parties and some Roman Catholic parties that veer toward ultranationalism, exemplified by Radio Marya, a radio station supported by a vocal minority of Poland's priests.</p>
        <p>But as everywhere in the former Soviet-bloc countries, patronage and corruption still play too large a role in politics, with parties and ministers often getting kickbacks from businesses and lobbyists for contracts or favors.</p>
        <p>The Polish government itself asked the World Bank to look into corruption last year, and was told that the main problem is graft among legislators, ministers and judges.</p>
        <p>Economically, everyone agrees, Poland's biggest problem is the deficit in the current trade account -- with imports, fed by new prosperity and credit, growing more rapidly than exports. The gap is now almost 8 percent of gross domestic product, said Ms. Binczak of Rzeczpospolita. The government has to do more, she said, to support exporters with credits and tax breaks or risk a currency crisis and a reduction in foreign capital flows that finance the budget deficit.</p>
        <p>Even so, Polish exports have at least quadrupled in the last decade, with more than 70 percent of exports going to countries of the European Union and only 10 percent now going to Russia, said Witold M. Orlowski of the Independent Center for Economic Studies. The economy is growing an average of about 5 percent a year over the past several years, and the government estimates $12 billion this year in foreign direct investment, after last year's record $8 billion -- a serious vote of confidence by hardheaded foreign businesses.</p>
        <p>Some diplomats and analysts are concerned that the minority Solidarity government, facing likely elections in the spring over the 2001 budget, will increase the budget deficit too much with populist spending, to try to fight slowly rising unemployment, estimated at 13.5 percent this year. But Ms. Binczak and others believe that the fundamentals of economic policy are set, in part by the markets and the pressure to join the European Union, and that the politicians will not want to disrupt them too badly.</p>
        <p>''The overwhelming sense is that the Poles are going in the right direction,'' a Western ambassador said. ''This is no longer a grimy little East European country trying to keep its head above water, but a country taking its place in Europe.''</p>
        <p>Agriculture remains the biggest structural challenge to a modernizing Poland -- and to its entry into the European Union. Some 25 percent of Poland's workers live in the poorer countryside, many of them on small farms. But of the country's 2.1 million farms, only half sell significant amounts to the market. The other half belong to subsistence farmers, whom no one wants to suddenly move into the cities. The European Union will help, but wants to contain the size of the subsidies.</p>
        <p>Farmers, protected by socialism, are the ones most concerned by the new Poland, which they see as a land of high taxes, falling farm prices and rising prices for fertilizer, fuel, seeds and machinery.</p>
        <p>In Skorzec, a tiny village about four miles south of Ciechanowiec, two farmers, Czeslaw Bojar, 59, and his neighbor, Kazimierz Murowski, 64, stopped work to chat and complain.</p>
        <p>''When I bought my first tractor, under Communism, it cost 27 pigs,'' Mr. Murowski said. ''Today, it costs 100 pigs.'' He stopped to scratch. ''It's not that we liked Communism, but life was better for us then.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bojar has six sons and worries that his farm, roughly 25 acres, will not be big enough for all of them, and that some will find themselves in the cities, unemployed. As for the European Union, he said: ''I can't know the future, and people disagree. But when we join the E.U., it will be like a bulldozer and break down all the walls, and then who knows?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murowski said everything was comparative. ''I remember how it was after the war, with everything destroyed and nothing to eat,'' he said. ''Well, it's better to be poor in peace than rich in war.''</p>
        <p>Still, the farmers have cars, heat, telephones and television, a big change from 15 years ago, they admit, and their neighbors, with a new roof and siding on their house, are off working in Belgium, earning good money.</p>
        <p>''When we were a Communist country, they said we'll be in heaven one day, and now they say it'll be even nicer that we're not Communists anymore,'' Mr. Bojar said. ''And we, we still hope it will be better than it is.''</p>
        <p>Karol Szyndzielorz, a former journalist turned businessman, put it simply. ''Poles cannot believe it, but it's true,'' he said. ''Poland is now a lucky country.''</p>
