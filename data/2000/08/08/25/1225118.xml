        <p>After a stormy public relations battle over his leadership succession at Arista Records, Clive Davis has formally fashioned a deal with BMG Entertainment to head a new label with a roster that includes up-and-coming young artists and Q-Tip, the rapper.</p>
        <p>The new label, which will be called J Records, is a joint venture between BMG and Mr. Davis, who founded Arista in 1975 and was replaced in July as chief executive by Antonio Reid. That succession produced tensions between BMG executives and Mr. Davis, 67, who issued public statements attributing his departure to the imposition of a general retirement policy by BMG's corporate parent, Bertelsmann A.G.</p>
