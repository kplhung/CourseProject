        <p>The United States Air Force is introducing a new recruitment campaign today in movie theaters nationwide.</p>
        <p>The five sentimental spots have a three-pronged focus: to recognize the achievements and commitment of Air Force personnel, to encourage recruitment and to emphasize retention. They were created by Siegelgale as a subcontractor of the Irving, Tex., office of Bozell Kamstra, the agency of record for the Air Force,</p>
        <p>''They wanted to tell a straightforward story, even though it's a bit sobering,'' said Kenneth Cooke, chief creative officer at Siegelgale in New York. He added that the new theme, ''America's Air Force; No One Comes Close,'' came out of a conversation during a humanitarian mission that forces from several countries participated in. Another commander told the American commander that no one comes close to the United States Air Force.</p>
        <p>In the beginning of September, the spots will be broadcast nationwide on cable networks like MTV and ESPN as well as during the Olympics and on shows like ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Spending for the campaign was estimated at more than $32 million; Bozell Kamstra is handling media duties.</p>
        <p>Separately, the Air Force is in the midst of a review for the lead agency on its account, with spending estimated at $50 million. The participants are Bozell Kamstra, part of the Bozell Group unit of True North Communications, which has worked on the account for more than four years on a contract; GSD&amp;M in Austin, Tex., part of the Omnicom Group; Siegelgale; Image Media Services in McLean, Va.; the McLean, Va., office of TMP Worldwide; and one undisclosed agency. A decision is expected in October.</p>
