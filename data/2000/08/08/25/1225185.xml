        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>A BOOST FOR GORE  New polls show Vice President Al Gore has enjoyed a significant postconvention boost in four crucial big states, overtaking Gov. George W. Bush in Minnesota and perhaps in Michigan and increasing his lead in New Jersey and California.</p>
        <p>In Michigan, an EPIC-MRA poll showed Mr. Gore ahead of Mr. Bush by two points, but that lead was within the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. In a preconvention poll, he trailed Mr. Bush by eight points.</p>
        <p>In Minnesota, a Mason-Dixon Poll gave Mr. Gore an eight-point lead over Mr. Bush. A July Mason-Dixon Poll had Mr. Bush ahead by three points.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University, gave Mr. Gore a 12-point lead. A New Jersey poll taken just before the Republican convention had Mr. Gore ahead by only four points.</p>
        <p>In California, a Field Poll had Mr. Gore leading Mr. Bush by 13 points. The previous Field Poll, in June, had him ahead by 11 points.</p>

        <p>NATIONAL MONUMENTS AN ISSUE  Dick Cheney suggested yesterday that some of the new national monuments created by President Clinton might be reviewed and rescinded if he and George W. Bush were elected.</p>
        <p>''Of course, it's not my decision to make,'' Mr. Cheney said at a campaign appearance in Central Point, Ore. ''It's the president-elect who has to make the decision. But I certainly expect we would review a lot of these decisions to see whether or not any action was appropriate.''</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Clinton had used his executive authority ''willy-nilly all over the West'' to create national monuments without considering the desires of the people who will be affected. Many fear that creating monument after monument could harm the West's economy by removing land from commercial uses like grazing, logging and mining. Mr. Clinton has created or added to 10 national monuments covering four million Western acres in his effort to carve out an environmental legacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney said that as a congressman from Wyoming he helped get one million acres designated as wilderness -- but only after listening to all sides. ''We need to strike a balance,'' he said. ''We need an opportunity for all to be heard.''</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>A BIG FUND-RAISING NIGHT  Vice President Al Gore pulled in more than $1.25 million last night in a pair of fund-raising dinners in Washington for the Democratic National Committee. The first dinner drew 30 people, most of them Indian-Americans, who paid $5,000 each. With other contributions, the dinner yielded $250,000.</p>
        <p>The second dinner drew about 60 people, most of them friends of Mr. Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who also attended. They each paid or raised varying amounts, with a maximum of $50,000, for a total of $1 million. Both dinners were served at the Mayflower Hotel, but the second was a Glatt Kosher meal, the pure form of Kosher food, blessed by a rabbi and provided by a restaurant, Dahan of Washington. Mr. Lieberman, in playful imitation of Mr. Gore at the convention, gave his wife an especially long kiss, and said, ''I don't want you to think there's any kind of competition on this ticket, but I told Hadassah I'm not going to stop until we reach seven seconds, which is the current world record.''</p>
