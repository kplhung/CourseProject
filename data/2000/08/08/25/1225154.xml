        <p>A 28-year-old woman was slightly injured yesterday afternoon when she was hit on the shoulder and the leg by a brick that fell from the construction site of a luxury apartment building at 15 West 63rd Street, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The woman, Kim Younhee, from Albany, was treated for minor injuries at Lenox Hill Hospital and released, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police said Ms. Younhee was on the sidewalk in front of 35 Central Park West when she was hit by either a brick or pieces of a brick that had fallen from the $99.5 million Park Laurel apartment tower development, a 40-story building that is being built atop the Y.M.C.A. there.</p>
        <p>After falling from the 21st floor, the brick hit the building's setback and bounced off, landing on the sidewalk and shattering, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the City Buildings Department, Ilyse Fink, said that the incident was being classified as an accident, and that the site meets safety regulations.</p>
        <p>Still, the Buildings Department issued a summons for failure to adequately safeguard the public and will investigate whether the construction conforms with the company's site safety plan.</p>
        <p>''This has actually been a very clean site,'' Ms. Fink said.</p>
        <p>Mary Costello, a spokeswoman for the construction manager, Bovis Lend Lease LMB, said that the subcontractor in charge of installing the building's bricks did not appear to have erred. ''It seems as though this is just one of these freaky things that happens,'' Ms. Costello said. ''There was adequate sidewalk protection.''</p>
        <p>The Park Laurel, which is scheduled to open next year, has been the subject of heated debate in recent years, with neighborhood groups moving to block its construction on  grounds that the tower was too massive for the block and that its construction could endanger children at nearby schools.</p>
        <p>It was the fourth such incident this summer. Most recently, a security guard was injured on July 28 when a 30-pound chunk of cast-iron facade fell off a building at Broadway and 33rd Street. On July 19, an 18-year-old woman was struck in the head by a brick that tumbled from the second floor of a building under renovation on the Lower East Side. The day before that, a tourist in the city for a religious conference suffered a fractured skull when a 25-pound stucco ornament fell from the 14th floor of a building at Seventh Avenue and 33rd Street.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 2, 2000, Saturday  An article on Aug. 25 about an accident in which a brick fell from a construction site atop the Y.M.C.A. building on West 63rd Street in Manhattan, slightly injuring a woman, included an erroneous address from the police for the building near which she was standing. It was 25 Central Park West. (There is no No. 35.)</p>
