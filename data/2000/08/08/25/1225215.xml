        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: VOTE AGAINST MUSEUM EXPANSION -- A resolution backing the renovation and expansion of the Museum of Modern Art failed to win a majority vote by the Manhattan Borough Board yesterday. The vote, which is advisory and cannot block the project, came after striking museum workers urged city officials to reject the $650 million plan until museum workers are paid fair wages. Two board members voted in favor of the resolution, four voted against and five abstained. The City Council must still consider the matter, and a spokeswoman for the museum said that the necessary approval was expected.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: PLEA IN TURKEY SCAM -- A New Jersey company has pleaded guilty to shortchanging the city's largest municipal workers union on thousands of pounds of turkey, Manhattan prosecutors said yesterday. The company, Corrado Family Affair of Clifton, N.J., pleaded guilty on Aug. 17 to inflating the weight of 11,500 turkeys it sold to Local 372 of District Council 37 in 1997. The company has agreed to pay $170,000 in fines and restitution, prosecutors said.</p>

        <p>BRONX: RUSSIAN ROULETTE DEATH -- A 22-year-old Bronx man killed himself playing Russian roulette Wednesday, said Officer Valerie St. Rose, a police spokeswoman. The man, Marlon Richards, of 4330 Wilder Avenue in the Wakefield section, was at home with his girlfriend at 6:30 p.m. and asked her to play the game, the police said. When she declined, Mr. Richards emptied the cylinder of his five-shot, .44-caliber revolver, put one round back in, spun the cylinder, put the gun to his temple, and pulled the trigger, the police said. He was pronounced dead at Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: HEPATITIS SHOTS REQUIRED -- Seventh graders will not be allowed to start school unless they have begun a three-shot vaccination regimen against hepatitis B. About 70 percent of all hepatitis B cases develop in adolescence or early adulthood, and adolescents who contract the disease, which can increase the chances of developing liver cancer and other conditions, have a 6 percent to 10 percent chance of developing chronic hepatitis, according to the State Health Department. Children in seventh grade are at the age when they begin to experiment with hepatitis-spreading behaviors that include unprotected sex, drug use and tattooing with unsterilized needles.</p>

        <p>NEW CASTLE: LINKS TO BODY ARE INVESTIGATED -- Officials are investigating whether there is any link between a man arrested in a routine traffic stop on Wednesday and a woman whose body was subsequently dug up on property the man recently bought in Bledsoe, Tenn. The man, Jeffrey Lewis Thompson, 38, was being held pending a bail hearing on charges of driving without a license and possession of a switchblade knife, said David Hebert, a spokesman for the Westchester County district attorney, Jeanine Pirro. Mr. Hebert declined to say what led authorities to dig up the body.</p>

        <p>SYRACUSE: HELP FOR FARMERS -- Gov. George E. Pataki signed legislation yesterday providing farmers with technical and financial assistance to meet standards for water and soil quality. Under a voluntary program, farmers could, for example, get help setting up composting operations to reduce the amount of manure spread on fields, a practice that can pollute groundwater. The governor said the program would help preserve farms at a time of falling crop prices and bad weather.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: TRANSIT DEFICIT POSSIBLE -- Several new rail projects may lead to a $2.2 billion deficit for New Jersey Transit over the next five years, agency officials said. Unless state and federal transit subsidies grow, the projected shortfall would have to be made up through the agency's first fare increases in a decade, or through service reductions and staff attrition. The agency is in the midst of an ambitious capital plan that includes three urban light-rail projects and a half-dozen new commuter rail lines proposed for fast-growing counties.</p>

        <p>BEDMINSTER: INTERIOR SECRETARY TO VISIT -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt plans to visit today in support of an application to designate the Vanderveer/ Knox house as a national heritage site, with federal funds to provide for its upkeep. The Colonial-era house is undergoing a privately financed $700,000 restoration, which will also create a museum of Continental Artillery artifacts. Prich Matthews, a historian, said that the house, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, was used by General Henry Knox of the Continental Artillery in 1779.</p>

        <p>ATLANTIC CITY: HARASSMENT CASE SETTLED -- Atlantic City's first female police sergeant will receive $1.4 million to settle a federal sexual harassment suit she filed against the city, her lawyer said. Sgt. Donna Hurley had accused fellow officers of making obscene comments and gestures, citing one incident in which a sanitary napkin marked with sergeant's stripes was hung above the podium where she conducted roll call. Her lawyer, Clifford Van Syoc, said the settlement order was signed Tuesday by Judge Joseph Irenas in United States District Court in Camden.</p>

        <p>NEW HAVEN: STABBING CHARGES LAPSE -- Officials may drop some charges against a man confined to a mental hospital after a 30-second stabbing spree at a New Haven coffeehouse in 1994. They say the statute of limitations has passed on the charges against Daniel Silva, 44, who was found incompetent to stand trial on charges of stabbing seven people. He told doctors he went on the spree after imagining that his mother had died, and that the victims were responsible for the attack. Defense lawyers and prosecutors agreed that the time limit on assault and weapons charges had lapsed, and that the charges should be dismissed. An arson charge would remain in effect.</p>
