        <p>After a summer of record delays and frayed nerves, the nation's flying public is being told the situation is untenable and will be fixed. It is a tale we have heard before, as recently as a year ago.</p>
        <p>Flight delays are up 10 percent from last year. This week Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater called in the key players in commercial aviation to talk about ways to improve what is increasingly looking like a broken system.</p>
        <p>There are some heartening signs that airlines, their unions and transportation regulators are genuinely ashamed of the endurance test flying has become. Some airlines have agreed to fly some of their short routes at lower altitudes to alleviate congestion in the skies, and are cutting back on their schedules to enhance their performance. In recent years, unrealistic peak-time scheduling by airlines at major airports has contributed greatly to delays.</p>
        <p>But there are no quick fixes for a system strained to its limits by the estimated 178 million passengers who will have boarded an aircraft this summer in the United States. That figure is up 37 percent from 1990. Clearly, the longest economic expansion in American history is as responsible for the clogged skies as any other culprit. And thanks to the revolution in information technology, airlines have become increasingly sophisticated at auctioning off seats to leisure travelers that would otherwise go empty. Planes are thus more packed than ever, making travel all the less enjoyable.</p>
        <p>Real, systemic relief for the nation's strained aviation grid is still a few years away, in the form of added runways at the busiest airports and a new satellite navigation system that will free pilots from having to stay within set flight lanes in the sky.</p>
        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has already become a more savvy and efficient traffic cop, though one bedeviled all summer by unusually bad weather. This June saw 19 ''severe weather'' days, compared with 5 in 1999. That helped make it the worst flying month ever, with more than 50,000 delayed flights, or 20.5 percent more than a year earlier. Because of the hub-and-spoke architecture of today's airline route systems, when things go badly in one part of the nation's air grid, it tends to affect traffic elsewhere.</p>
        <p>United Airlines' labor travails this summer did not help matters either. Pilots at United, the nation's largest airline, turned down overtime and called in sick because of a continuing labor dispute, forcing the airline to cancel as many as 600 flights over a recent weekend.</p>
        <p>Secretary Slater has set up a task force to look at ways to enhance the notoriously sloppy quality of information shared by airlines, regulators and consumers. This is no small matter, as anyone stuck at an airport and deprived of meaningful information will agree. Too often, passengers are treated like children incapable of handling the truth, or airlines massage facts to shift blame for delays. If nothing else, a passenger trapped in a hub-and-spoke nightmare is entitled to accurate information.</p>
