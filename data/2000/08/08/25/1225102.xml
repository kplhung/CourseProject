        <p>Jim Skipper, the Giants' former offensive coordinator who was named assistant head coach during the off-season, has left the team to become the head coach of the Memphis franchise of the XFL, the pro football venture of the World Wrestling Federation.</p>
        <p>Skipper was the Giants' offensive coordinator from 1997 through 1999, although Coach Jim Fassel was heavily involved in the design of the game plan and called the team's plays in games. Late last season, Fassel shifted the play-calling job to the assistant coach Sean Payton, and this winter Fassel promoted Payton to offensive coordinator.</p>

Late last season, Fassel shifted the play-calling job to the assistant coach Sean Payton, and this winter Fassel promoted Payton to offensive coordinator.</p>
        <p>Skipper, 51, has coached for three National Football League teams and coached in the defunct United States Football League. With Skipper's departure, Fassel promoted Mike Gillhamer, the offensive quality control coach, to running backs coach. Gillhamer has filled a variety of roles in 18 years as a coach, working previously with the team's backs and kick returners. He will be assisted by Charles Way, the former Giants fullback.</p>
