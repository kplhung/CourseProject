        <p>TWO years ago, on a sultry August morning, Ken Aretsky was playing golf in Southampton and riding high indeed. That regrettable public unpleasantness at the ''21'' Club was long behind him (more about that later). He was loving his life as the doting father of two small children (more about that later, too). And he was basking in critical accolades for having created two successful new Manhattan restaurants, Patroon and Butterfield 81 (much, much more about that later, as well).</p>
        <p>That's when the phone call came: the United States government was charging him with violating the Trading With the Enemy Act. Such a transgression can be a felony punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of $100,000.</p>
        <p>Federal agents armed with search warrants had seized dozens of boxes of cigars from the upstairs cigar bar of Patroon, Mr. Aretsky's three-star restaurant at 160 East 46th Street. The next day Mr. Aretsky and his cigar bar manager stood in federal court, accused of buying and selling cigars made in Cuba.</p>
        <p>In a stogie-crazed city afire with aficionados overwhelmed by an abundance of bootleg Cuban Cohibas and Montecristos, cigar worshipers bristled at the news.</p>
        <p>Indeed, cigarophiles loudly contended that the arrest was a publicity stunt. For though the United States had imposed a trade embargo on Cuba in the early 1960's, for decades American cigar smokers had hidden Cuban stogies in their luggage and had had cigars mailed to them from London tobacconists.</p>
        <p>But officials said they were following up on a violation of federal law. Customs agents had tracked a large illegal shipment of Cuban cigars to a house in Connecticut. A raid there had revealed a list of clients that included Mr. Aretsky, his manager and five others, who were arrested.</p>
        <p>''It was devastating,'' said Mr. Aretsky, now 59, in his first interview since that time. ''I was shocked. I suppose some people think that notoriety is cool, but I didn't, and neither did my family. It was rough for them. I worried about the future of my business.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aretsky had never had a brush with the law before. He grew up at 504 Grand Street on the Lower East Side, took over his father's seltzer-gas supply business, sold it, then made a 1972 success of his first restaurant, Truman's, in Roslyn, N.Y.</p>
        <p>After a stint in Manhattan as a stockbroker (one co-worker was the future domestic diva Martha Stewart) he opened the thriving Upper East Side saloon, Oren &amp; Aretsky. He followed that with Arcadia at 21 East 62nd Street, which flourished until the lease ran out in 1997.</p>
        <p>In 1987, Mr. Aretsky was asked to turn around that power-lunch dinosaur, the ''21'' Club. He amended the food and attracted a devoted, less geriatric following. His genial presence was marked by his signature wardrobe, for which the word ''dapper'' is hardly dapper enough.</p>
        <p>BUT after eight years at the helm, ''I still had no equity position in the restaurant,'' he said, adding that he was fired in 1995 after a dispute with the owners. He sued for breach of contract, but says the case is in limbo because the company that hired him filed for bankruptcy last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aretsky jumped back on the horse immediately by opening an American bistro, Butterfield 81, then opened his competitor to ''21,'' Patroon, which won three stars from The New York Times, in 1996 and again in 1998.</p>
        <p>By then Mr. Aretsky was enjoying mature fatherhood. He and his third wife, Diana Lyne, a former Tiffany &amp; Company senior vice president who is a consultant there, had two children, Grace and Eugene, now 7 and 6. (He has two grown children from his first marriage.)</p>
        <p>And then federal agents came through the door. Mr. Aretsky acknowledged that ''Cubans were sold here with my knowledge,'' he said on a recent afternoon in the former cigar bar, now a banquet space.</p>
        <p>''Clearly we did something wrong and were punished accordingly,'' Mr. Aretsky said. The United States attorney's office in Manhattan says he ultimately pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and paid a $5,000 fine. He was sentenced to serve 200 hours of community service.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Aretsky never anticipated was that he would become so passionate about his court obligation, as he journeyed to the city's inner-city high schools, mentoring students and working with teachers.</p>
        <p>He is doing so through the auspices of a 10-year-old nonprofit group called C-Cap, which promotes restaurant careers among inner-city students. ''I'm trying to get these kids interested in working as line cooks and pastry chefs and managers,'' Mr. Aretsky said. ''There aren't enough bodies to fill all these jobs, and restaurants need these kids' tremendous energy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aretsky's supervisor, Richard Grausman, founder and president of C-Cap, said, ''Ken has put his whole heart into this,'' referring to the group that reaches out to 2,200 students a year. ''Ken has been wonderful with the kids and the teachers.''</p>
        <p>And now, this August, Mr. Aretsky is about to embark on a new multimillion-dollar restaurant venture on the Upper East Side. ''It'll be a fabulous neighborhood American brasserie,'' he said, name and location to be revealed ''imminently.''</p>
        <p>What of his missionary work with students? ''It's a new world to me, something I knew nothing about,'' he said. ''I hope to keep involved with these kids for the rest of my life.''</p>
