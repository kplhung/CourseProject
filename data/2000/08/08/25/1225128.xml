        <p>In the rapidly changing world of European wireless telecommunications, companies are increasingly hinting that dating may be more productive than marriage.</p>
        <p>Many companies are considering mere alliances rather than outright mergers, at least for now. That contrasts with the wave of merger activity over the last year that culminated in the $181 billion bid by Vodafone AirTouch for Mannesman.</p>
        <p>So what has changed?</p>
        <p>The cost of third-generation mobile phone licenses has reshaped the economics of the industry. In particular, the soaring prices of acquiring these licenses have drained the balance sheets of most players and crimped their ability to finance deals. Political roadblocks have quashed several high-profile marriage plans. And the number of eligible partners has simply dwindled.</p>
        <p>Just today, Telefonica of Spain and Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong entered Italy's auction of next-generation wireless licenses with their own local partners. Telefonica teamed with Ipse 2000 S.p.A., and Hutchinson joined Andala S.p.A. to compete for five licenses.</p>
        <p>For companies like Telefonica and Hutchison, it is much easier and much cheaper to bid collectively, analysts say. But partnerships come with their own set of risks. Hutchison recently backed out of a joint bid for a third-generation mobile phone license in Germany, for example, leaving its partners, Royal KPN of the Netherlands and NTT DoCoMo of Japan, to foot the bill.</p>
        <p>Meantime, though, the philosophy of developing partnerships rather than mergers carries over to the strategy of the smaller players that are still available for acquisition.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't be holding my breath for any big deals for these little guys,'' said Jonathan Adams, an analyst with J. P. Morgan in London. ''The acquirer is not calling the shots anymore,'' he said, explaining that smaller companies now have more options available to them.</p>
        <p>Part of that latitude stems from the fact that many smaller mobile operators are still government controlled. KPN, which is partly owned by the Dutch government, has long been seen as an acquisition target, but analysts now say that the company will probably seek alliances.</p>
        <p>Sonera of Finland, which has also been seen as a takeover target and is being eyed by Telefonica and France Telecom, may still go the alliance route. Indeed, it successfully allied with Telefonica to win a third-generation mobile license in Germany and is part of the consortium to bid for a license with Telefonica in Italy. Through that relationship, some analysts say, Sonera might simply create a broader alliance with Telefonica in the end. Still, the Finnish government has expressed an interest in selling its stake, so a sale might be in the offing.</p>
        <p>Whatever sales do occur, analysts expect fewer company-to-company acquisitions and more alliances.</p>
        <p>''We wouldn't expect consolidation to take place at the company level,'' said one analyst who asked not to be identified. ''The political hurdles are quite high. More likely, we will see consolidation on the operational or divisional levels.''</p>
        <p>Outright mergers between the former European state-run monopolies may well be put on hold until the respective governments sell off their stakes. The Spanish government quashed Telefonica's attempt to merge with KPN. Likewise, the German and Italian governments butted heads over the unsuccessful attempt by Deutsche Telekom to buy Telecom Italia more than a year ago.</p>
        <p>Although most governments have pledged to sell off their shares in these companies, that process will probably prove slow. Selling large blocks of stock requires willing buyers. With telecommunications shares out of favor, investors' desire for these shares remains muted.</p>
        <p>And there is uncertainty over the intentions of some governments.</p>
        <p>''Sonera stated that press reports suggesting that Finland's government was looking to exit Sonera were misinformed and misleading,'' David Hogg, an analyst with Commerzbank, said in a daily note to clients. ''Instead, Sonera repeated the aim to explore the possibility of partnering with another telco to unlock value greater than the mere sum of parts.''</p>
        <p>Sonera stands in contrast to the remaining small-to-midsize telecommunications companies that could eventually be bought by larger players. In addition to offering a mobile network in Finland, Sonera boasts advanced encryption technology, the kind that allows secure online transactions, through its SmartTrust division, as well as a third-generation mobile phone portal called Zed.</p>
        <p>Most other midsize players considered to be takeover targets bring a relatively small mobile footprint in some Scandinavian countries to the bargaining table. These include Elisa, the No. 2 operator in Finland behind Sonera; Telia, a leader in Sweden and Norway; and Telenor A.S.A., a front-runner in Denmark.</p>
        <p>''The more unique the asset is, the more attractive the company is,'' a Vodafone representative said. ''And that's becoming more and more rare.'' Even so, the representative said Vodafone would shy away from making a bid for Sonera, because ''we've always maintained that they're too expensive.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Sonera's alliance with Telefonica may not only fill the role of an outright merger, but also serve as a blueprint for other companies that are itching to hitch.</p>
