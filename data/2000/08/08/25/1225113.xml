        <p>President Clinton has devoted unusual energy to strengthening ties between Africa and the United States. But some of Mr. Clinton's past efforts have led him to embrace leaders who were neither democrats nor statesmen. The journey he embarks on today is more promising.</p>
        <p>This weekend he will be in Nigeria, visiting President Olusegun Obasanjo, the elected leader of Africa's most populous democracy. On Monday he travels to Arusha, Tanzania, to join Nelson Mandela, the continent's elder statesman, who is working to end Burundi's civil war.</p>
        <p>In the 15 months since Mr. Obasanjo succeeded a corrupt and repressive military dictatorship, he has eased senior officers from power, curbed some corruption and preached tolerance among quarreling ethnic and religious groups. Washington has showered him with aid, including $10 million to reform the military and $50 million to train Nigerian troops for peacekeeping. But Nigeria's passage toward democracy has been uneven. Mr. Obasanjo has worked poorly with the legislature and has brutally crushed unrest in the Niger Delta.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton will use his time in Nigeria to encourage American investment, promote democratic reforms and support AIDS education. His visit also coincides with the start of American military training of the Nigerian peacekeepers, who bear the main burden of maintaining order in Sierra Leone. Nigerian peacekeepers were previously known for violating civilians' rights. Mr. Obasanjo wants to end such abuses and has sought American help to teach the skills and discipline needed for these missions. America's own reputation will be on the line when graduates of the training program go on duty in Sierra Leone. Washington must vigilantly monitor their performance.</p>
        <p>Monday's stop in Tanzania is meant to support Mr. Mandela's efforts to win a Burundi peace agreement. Like Rwanda, Burundi is divided between a ruling Tutsi minority and a large and restive Hutu majority. Negotiations aim at getting its political parties and armed factions to agree on ethnic coexistence and power-sharing. Mr. Clinton's brief Africa trip usefully demonstrates American interest in African democracy and peace.</p>
