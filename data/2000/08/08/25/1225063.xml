        <p>In ''Spent'' Max (Jason London) is such an inveterate gambler that he leaves everything to chance.

        <p>In ''Spent'' Max (Jason London) is such an inveterate gambler that he leaves everything to chance. He picks his sports bets by writing team names on a piece of paper, then carefully tearing it up and flinging the scraps into the air. He bets on the teams whose names are on the pieces he grabs. It's as imaginative a way to play out a gambling addiction as has been seen in the movies in a long time. This crazy character moment comes early enough in the picture to make the audience believe there is more such characterization ahead. There isn't, though. ''Spent'' coasts on that gesture and then finally runs out of steam.</p>
        <p>''Spent,'' which opens today at the Sutton, is essentially a movie about people who are unable to communicate, which in this film is synonymous with denial. That point is made clear by the opening, a montage of motivational speakers from infomercials bellowing into the camera, admonishing viewers about wasting their lives and potential.</p>
        <p>Max's roommate, Grant (James Parks), has a crush on him but refuses to admit he is gay. And there are scenes like the one featuring Max's girlfriend, Brigette (Charlie Spradling), and her parents at brunch. Brigette, who has a drinking problem, is downing one chardonnay after another. Her mother clicks away with castanets to make herself the center of attention, and her father stares obliviously into space.</p>
        <p>The writer and director, Gil Cates Jr., is trying to make a movie out of of grand, memorable sequences like Max's flinging the bits of paper, and his future, into the air. But much of the rest of the picture rings hollow and imitative: for example, the glib, self-mocking chatter between Max, an unemployed actor, and his show-biz hanger-on friends Doug (Phil Lewis) and Nathan (Erin Beaux), which reaches at wit and succeeds only in showing the strain.</p>
        <p>The main story, such as it is, involves Max's not coping with his addiction, persisting in gambling long after it has left him teetering on personal and financial ruin. A subplot about a script Doug has written for Jack Nicholson -- a script about a movie star obsessed with his floor seats for the Lakers -- is too obvious to get the laughs it's after.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cates's material feels autobiographical; he must have lived many of Max's moments, and the pathetic self-absorption of the losers on the periphery of the movie business has an ache that is often real. ''I got a residual from that 'Silk Stalkings' episode,'' Max says to explain what he's living on. Mr. Cates is from a successful show business family, and he probably grew up knowing the kind of aimless guys who, in the backs of their minds, always knew they had money to fall back on. (His father is the well-known television director Gil Cates; his uncle Joe gets an executive producer credit on ''Spent,'' and his brother Jonathan is its editor.)</p>
        <p>Max is also good at sifting through his options, shifting loans and debts like chess pieces, and scamming family friends like the naive Mrs. Walsh (Barbara Barrie) into keeping him afloat. He gets a charge from being just barely a step ahead, and the sick look on his face when he loses a bet shows how deeply he has sunk into his gambling addiction. But ''Spent'' lacks the junkie's rush, the juice that keeps gamblers going. Mr. Cates wants to set up a mirror, making Max self-righteous about Brigette's alcoholism. The whole thing feels minor, though, and the troubles seem only skin deep: ''The Days of Whine and Roses.''</p>
        <p>In trying to give all of its characters face time, ''Spent'' is spread so thin that what narrative thread there is dissipates. There's an unwieldy attempt to graft farce onto the mingy melodrama. By the end the most vivid figure on the screen is the lovable doggie who goes wherever dangling fingers are waiting to give the happy pooch a scratch.</p>
        <p>SPENT</p>
