        <p>A brief article in Circuits on Aug. 17 about a study showing that regular Internet users stay in greater touch with family and friends than infrequent users included incorrect figures from an author of the study. (The study's conclusions were unaffected.)</p>
        <p>Daily Internet users in the study had, on average, 583 contacts of all kinds per year with friends and relatives living within 30 miles, not 1,312. People who used the Internet one or two times a year had an average of 396 contacts, not 471. Daily Internet users had 266 contacts with more distant friends and relatives, not 997. People who used the Internet once or twice a year had 99 such contacts, not 75.</p>
