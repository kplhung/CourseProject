        <p>The home video game industry is about to embark on what is certain to become a bitter and bloody year of new technology and cost-cutting, which many people in the business say will claim one or more victims.</p>
        <p>Nintendo offered the opening move today at the Spaceworld video-game trade show in Tokyo, announcing both a new home console based on an I.B.M. PowerPC microprocessor and a new version of its handheld Game Boy portable system.</p>
        <p>Neither system is scheduled to arrive in the United States market before next year. For this Christmas selling season, the Sony Corporation will clearly dominate the United States market with its highly promoted Playstation 2, which is scheduled to go on sale in the United States on Oct. 22. It is a machine based on a custom chip developed with a $1.3 billion investment Sony made jointly with Toshiba.</p>
        <p>In the wings, the Microsoft Corporation is stalking the game industry with its own Intel-based video-game system that the company says it hopes will arrive for the Christmas 2001 season.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the frenetic competition to dominate the game console market has forced Sega to retool its strategy. On Sept. 7, the company will bring out its Sega online game network. It will also reportedly reduce the price of its Dreamcast video-game system, which has trailed Sony's Playstation in the American market.</p>
        <p>The next generation video game market is being attacked by giant consumer electronics and software companies that have different views of the world.</p>
        <p>''It's like three giant planets colliding,'' said Greg Galanos, a longtime software tool developer for the video game industry who is now managing director for Softbank Venture Capital in Mountain View, Calif.</p>
        <p>In the case of the three giants, Sony is intent on creating an around-the-clock home entertainment portal, Nintendo has focused on a game-appliance strategy and Microsoft is bringing its PC-centric strategy to a consumer electronics world, Mr. Galanos said. Sega, not as strong, ''is likely to end up as a moon,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sega, which industry reports say will soon cut the price of its Dreamcast machine to $149, from $199, and bundle the price of the machine into its new online game business, has been saying that the Sony Playstation 2 does not have as large a technical advantage as the Japanese consumer giant has claimed.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Sega executives are warning that a performance war between the giants could ultimately damage the video game industry. ''If Sony and Microsoft continue to outspec themselves, they will kill each other and take the industry with them,'' said Charles Bellfield, communications director for Sega of America Dreamcast.</p>
        <p>Sony has made far-reaching performance claims for the Playstation 2 and, as a result, is enduring some criticism from game experts who have suggested that the first games available for the new system have not matched the talk.</p>
        <p>Microsoft is trying to market its machine as more powerful than the Playstation 2, while saying that the company is being careful not to ''overpromise.''</p>
        <p>Analysts said that all of the video game makers, which generally do about 80 percent of their business during the Christmas selling season, could face stiff competition this year from new intelligent consumer appliances that will be vying for attention.</p>
        <p>''This Christmas, we're going to see big pushes from both Replay and TiVo,'' said Nick Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a San Francisco-based market research firm. TiVo and ReplayTV are the leading brands of digital video recorders.</p>
        <p>Consumers, he said, will be presented with a wide variety of choices this year. In addition to the new digital video recorders, there will be  handheld gadgets like cell phones and personal digital assistants.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the game companies will be challenged to explain their next generation products to consumers. All of the machines will add features like network connections and the ability to play DVD's and CD's, making them appear closer to interactive set-top television boxes than dedicated gaming appliances.</p>
        <p>Today, Nintendo seemed intent on proving that its GAMECUBE could compete head-to-head with Sony and Microsoft. The system will be based on a 405 MHz PowerPC processor, include a proprietary 1.5-gigabyte optical disk storage system, will have wireless game controllers and will fit in a package 6 inches by 6 inches by 4.3 inches.</p>
        <p>The system will go on sale in Japan in July 2001 and come to the United States three months later.</p>
        <p>Microsoft will introduce its system, which will be manufactured in Mexico by Flextronics, about the same time. Based on a 733 MHz Pentium III processor, it will include a 10 gigabyte or larger hard disk and an Ethernet connection and will come without an operating system. The operating system will be carried on each game disk and loaded when the disk is inserted to play a game.</p>
