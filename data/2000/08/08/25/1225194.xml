        <p>Directed by Valerie Breiman</p>
        <p>82 minutes; not rated</p>
        <p>''First love is the most powerful because nobody's been hurt.''</p>
        <p>''Love is a minefield.''</p>
        <p>''I believe in relationships. Mine just happen to be short ones.''</p>
        <p>''Women like to turn men into weirdos.''</p>
        <p>''The longer you're with the same person, the more annoying they'll become.''</p>
        <p>That is but a sampling of the wit and wisdom that Valerie Breiman has managed to pump into her slight but bright and charming romantic comedy, ''Love and Sex.''</p>
        <p>Written and directed by Ms. Breiman, this film tracks the misadventurous road to love taken by Kate Welles (Famke Janssen) from her girlhood playground passion to her loss of virginity to her high school French teacher to -- one hopes -- a happy ending with Adam Levy (Jon Favreau), the artist who shamelessly spirits her away from a standup comedian at an exhibition of his latest paintings.</p>
        <p>Kate herself is a writer for one of those trendy women's magazines where orders from her demanding boss to come up with 2,500 happy, perky words by the end of the day on how to find and keep that perfect man prompt her to ponder the flashback-inducing question: What makes a relationship last forever?</p>
        <p>Although Kate's relationship with Adam starts off happily and progresses in stages to sex and other intimacies, living together, cute arguments over tastes in films, and eventually to pregnancy, it descends into sexlessness, annoyance, resentment over past affairs and a decision to part company.</p>
        <p>While Kate and Adam remain in touch, she is soon partying with a young man described as a perverted basketball player obsessed with her derriere, followed by a torrid affair with the not-too-bright but hunky star of topless Ninja movies who picks her up while she is shopping in a store specializing in devices for the enhancement of sexual pleasure.</p>
        <p>''Love and Sex'' is occasionally too cute for its own good, but it is packed with recognizable situations. And Ms. Janssen and Mr. Favreau provide enjoyably consoling company for those still dating their way through life.</p>
