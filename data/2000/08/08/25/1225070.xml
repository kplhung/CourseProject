        <p>''Catfish in Black Bean Sauce'' deals with adopted children reared  by parents of a different race, but Chi Muoi Lo, the writer and director, plays around with the idea in an unexpected way. The film, full of twists, tries to exploit all the comic streams running through its narrative, a gambit Mr. Lo isn't quite up to seizing. (He has more ideas than he knows what to do with.) And the movie isn't quite as much fun as it could be.</p>
        <p>In this case the Vietnamese-born Dwayne (Mr. Lo) and Mai (Lauren Tom) have been brought up by African-Americans, Harold (Paul Winfield) and Dolores (Mary Alice). Mai was 10 and her brother considerably younger when they were taken in. The uptight Dwayne, who feels more comfortable with his parents, is a rising star at the bank where he works and has a beautiful African-American girlfriend, Nina (Sanaa Lathan). He wants to propose but can't quite muster the nerve.</p>

        <p>''Catfish in Black Bean Sauce'' deals with adopted children reared  by parents of a different race, but Chi Muoi Lo, the writer and director, plays around with the idea in an unexpected way. The film, full of twists, tries to exploit all the comic streams running through its narrative, a gambit Mr. Lo isn't quite up to seizing. (He has more ideas than he knows what to do with.) And the movie isn't quite as much fun as it could be.</p>
        <p>In this case the Vietnamese-born Dwayne (Mr. Lo) and Mai (Lauren Tom) have been brought up by African-Americans, Harold (Paul Winfield) and Dolores (Mary Alice). Mai was 10 and her brother considerably younger when they were taken in. The uptight Dwayne, who feels more comfortable with his parents, is a rising star at the bank where he works and has a beautiful African-American girlfriend, Nina (Sanaa Lathan). He wants to propose but can't quite muster the nerve.</p>
        <p>Mai has issues, as they say on daytime television. She is consumed by the urge to find her birth mother; Mai was old enough at their separation to remember her. Mai represents what the movie is really about: the need to keep things real. She is constantly searching for their mother and eventually finds her, which complicates everyone's life, especially when Mai disrupts her brother's proposal by breaking the news. And with ethnic emphases in American culture shifting so quickly -- a shift ''Catfish'' recognizes -- what is real becomes more and more confusing, especially for people like Dwayne, who doesn't know if he's coming or going.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lo's mild comedy is moved along by the sanguine dignity of Mr. Winfield and Ms. Alice. They're the kind of adoptive parents an orphan would dream of, and they're as understanding as only screen inventions can be. Mr. Winfield doles out generous helpings of his chuckle, and Ms. Alice frets winsomely. Her Dolores has a mother-hen instinct that keeps hovering and fluttering over her young.</p>
        <p>The premise of a race comedy outside the usual black-white dynamic is inventive enough that the tremors of shock and confrontation that rumble through the film do a little of the director's work for him. He has managed an incredibly fine job of casting. The performances by the actors playing the parents have an air of authenticity and, in Mr. Winfield's case, authority.</p>
        <p>But the movie introduces farce complications so abruptly that they seem to demand the oohs and surprised applause of a live audience for a sitcom.</p>
        <p>A climactic dinner that tries to combine the ethnic cuisines of both families is the kind of disaster that can make one feel embarrassed for the actors; it's cringe-inducing. Yet Mr. Lo delivers other comic points with a minimum of fuss, showing Asian youths using hip-hop slang and the chasm that can exist between minorities and is deepened when the wrong words are used. At times Mr. Lo relies on a creaky mechanism to get his laughs, especially upon the arrival of Thanh (Kieu Chin), the birth mother of Dwayne and Mai, which comes as a big shock to Harold and Dolores.</p>
        <p>Dwayne is the movie's magnet for tension; he has gathered all of it, which often seems to pull his shoulders up to neck level. ''Catfish'' is by no means a dumb movie, but it is in such a hurry to get its laughs that it feels as stressed as Dwayne. Mr. Lo throws in mix-ups with Dwayne's roommate, who may or may not be gay, and racial tensions that emerge from a run-in with a policeman when he and Nina are out. The issues are targets to be demolished, skeet in the way of Mr. Lo's shotgun.</p>
        <p>He might have served his material better if he had not been before the camera. It takes a lot of concentration to finish a film under less arduous circumstances. But what he doesn't do is sentimentalize any of this, a smart impulse.</p>
        <p>''Catfish in Black Bean Sauce'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes profanity and sexual situations.</p>
