        <p>''Walk your horses or pay two dollars' fine.''</p>
        <p>That command, painted in black letters, looms above the heads of drivers venturing onto America's longest covered bridge, which spans the Connecticut River between this town and Windsor, Vt., on the opposite shore.</p>
        <p>Long after the sign was put up, it seems fair to read its intent as saying: ''Take it easy and look around.'' It's a good idea, because this area, halfway up the Vermont-New Hampshire border, is rich in recreational opportunities and cultural rewards.</p>
        <p>On the New Hampshire side, head two miles north on Route 12A in Cornish and you will find yourself at the Saint-Gaudens National Historical Site, the only unit of the National Park Service dedicated to the memory of an American sculptor.</p>
        <p>An artist celebrated in the late 19th century and lately the subject of renewed admiration, Augustus Saint-Gaudens created realistic statues and bas-reliefs of prominent figures of his era.</p>
        <p>He is probably best known to New Yorkers for his equestrian statue of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, which strides forth from Grand Army Plaza at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street. His Abraham Lincoln stands in Lincoln Park, Chicago. And his statue of the Rev. Phillips Brooks can be seen outside Trinity Church in Boston's Copley Square. Models and sketches for some of these and other works are displayed in Saint-Gaudens's capacious studio. Bronze casts of other statues are arranged throughout the handsome grounds of the outdoor museum.</p>
        <p>From the covered bridge, too, you can drive west to Woodstock, Vt., home to the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historic Park, which incorporates a conservationist theme, as well as impressive 19th-century houses and churches, a network of mountain trails and boutiques aplenty. My wife, Margaret, and I chose a midsummer weekend to visit the area. We looked forward to a scenic drive along Vermont's twisting back roads. We did get that drive, but only after the adventure of having the family car give out (in a driving rainstorm, no less) in Bennington, Vt., 100 miles short of our goal. The AAA-dispatched mechanic shook his head at my ignorance of local custom when I asked -- while he and I stood by the upraised hood, getting soaked to the skin -- if it was possible to have someone look at the car that evening.</p>
        <p>''Sidewalks around here roll up at 5,'' he said. A glance at my watch showed we had 15 minutes to get the car into a garage, where we could at least get it onto a mechanic's schedule for the coming Monday.</p>
        <p>But here luck provided a safety net: a Mazda dealer stood only two blocks away. The service department took in our elderly 626, the manager directed us to what may well have been the last available rental car in town and an employee entertained our 2-year-old son.</p>
        <p>So, after two hours' delay, we could press onward through the storm to the Woodstock Inn, assuring each other that it could have been a lot worse.</p>
        <p>The next morning when we looked out our window we saw to our relief that the rain had finally stopped, although the skies remained cloudy. On emerging from the hotel (a very child-friendly place, we happily discovered), we found ourselves facing the village green, a covered bridge and, as a backdrop to it all, the forested slopes of 1,400-foot Mount Tom. Altogether, it was everything tourists hope for when they imagine a picturesque New England village.</p>
        <p>And tourists there were, flowing up and down the sidewalks along Center and Elm Streets and packing the tables in the local restaurants. But you don't have to go far to find ample elbow room. The Saint-Gaudens site, a 20-minute drive away, sits atop a lovely, partly forested expanse of ground above the Connecticut River.</p>
        <p>The area includes Aspet, a former tavern that the Irish-born sculptor (whose name is pronounced saint-GODD-ens) converted into his home after he began visiting the area in 1885. The property was donated to the Park Service in 1965, after four decades as a private memorial to the sculptor, established by his family.</p>
        <p>Nearby is the sculptor's studio, whose classical porch frames a view of Mount Ascutney to the southwest. Exhibits inside the studio introduce visitors to Saint-Gaudens's work, including a sleek nude figure of the Greek goddess Diana, with bow and arrow poised to shoot. In its time, it was considered slightly scandalous, probably owing to its prominent display of the undraped female body. The original gilded copper figure served as a weathervane, crowning an earlier Madison Square Garden, a Stanford White building that opened in 1890 for concerts, sports events and political conventions. Diana was New York's first statue illuminated at night by electric lights. She came down in 1925, removed before the building was razed, and now stands in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>Saint-Gaudens began his career as a carver of tiny cameos, during his youth in Civil War-era New York. He developed his talents as a young man in Paris and Rome. But his career, spent mostly in New York, really began to take off when, at 28, he received a commission to create a statue honoring the Union naval hero Adm. David Farragut, victor of the Civil War battles of New Orleans and Mobile Bay. The statue stands in Madison Square Park in New York.</p>
        <p>Saint-Gaudens's life intersected with those of many famous American figures in the arts, like Stanford White, Charles Follen McKim and the painter John LaFarge. He married Augusta Homer, a cousin of Winslow Homer.</p>
        <p>The historic site does not overwhelm the visitor with information. Instead, there is opportunity to wander the estate's formal gardens and study casts of some of the sculptor's works.</p>
        <p>Among them is his bas-relief Robert Gould Shaw Memorial, another Civil War monument, this one celebrating the slain commander of the 54th Massachusetts and the black troops who fought with him. It was the first monument to black soldiers who fought in the Civil War. (Their feats were depicted in the film ''Glory.'') An earlier version of the monument stands at Boston Common.</p>
        <p>In a separate grove is the quietly powerful statue Saint-Gaudens created to adorn the tomb of Clover Adams, Henry Adams's wife, who committed suicide in 1885. The original stands in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, where it has drawn many admirers. One was Eleanor Roosevelt, who regarded the statue as a female figure representing someone who had ''transcended pain and hurt to achieve serenity,'' according to ''The Life and Work of Augustus Saint-Gaudens,'' by Burke Wilkinson (Dover, 1992).</p>
        <p>A newer gallery nearby contains a small atrium and pool and displays of busts and bas-reliefs, including studies the sculptor did for the Robert Louis Stevenson memorial in Edinburgh.</p>
        <p>And visiting this open-air museum, we found it easy to be drawn to a closer look at the surrounding woods and hills.</p>
        <p>On Sunday we climbed Mount Tom from its base in Faulkner Park in Woodstock, a very short walk from the village green. A 1.6-mile trail led us to the summit as the sound of church bells rose from the town.</p>
        <p>Split-log benches have been thoughtfully provided along the trail. At three points near the summit, views over the surrounding valley are particularly rewarding.</p>
        <p>Afterward, feeling ready for something on flatter ground, we stopped by the Billings Farm and Museum, a neatly kept, working dairy farm that continues the conservationist ethic of its founder, a Vermonter named Frederick Billings.</p>
        <p>He made his wealth in the West during the mid-19th century (leaving his name on the city of Billings, Mont.) before returning home and adopting the conservationist ideas of an earlier Woodstock resident, George Perkins Marsh.</p>
        <p>These days the Billings Farm is clearly a family destination, thronged with parents and young children the afternoon we visited. Most of them, it seemed, chose to gather in the cow barn, to watch a farm employee milk the herd (by machine, not by hand) and to stand awed as the cows went noisily about their digestive business.</p>
        <p>But while the farm offers the very young the chance to see big animals up close, there is much else to be learned, too. When we stopped by the 1890 farmhouse, a guide eagerly explained the process of making butter, the farm's specialty a century ago.</p>
        <p>A pound, packed and shipped in a round ash wood box, cost 30 cents by the time it reached Boston. That seemed steep for the era. But, the guide said: ''In 1890, you had two choices for cooking: you had butter and you had lard. And if you lived in a city and didn't have a cow, you paid 30 cents a pound.''</p>
        <p>She also told us Vermont's landscape today is vastly different from that of a century ago. Back then the state served the timber industry too well. The demands of house builders and the railroads led to a stripping of the wooded landscape. Mount Tom was fairly denuded.</p>
        <p>The interest of Marsh and Billings in reforestation, as well as the conservation interests of a later resident of the same property, Laurance S. Rockefeller, is related at a larger site, across Route 12 from the farm, the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park. The Park service offers tours and information on the history of conservation.</p>
        <p>All this added to our appreciation of the landscape as we drove south on our return, a route that took us past Calvin Coolidge's boyhood farm, now a historic site in Plymouth, Vt.</p>
        <p>But once we reached Bennington, our talk by necessity turned to the mechanical, focusing specifically on that part of a car's engine called the distributor, how it works and what a new one costs. But this was another matter.</p>
