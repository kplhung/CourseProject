        <p>After four years of fighting a legend, the Liberty drew within a basket last night of bringing the Houston Comets back to this planet.</p>
        <p>The sellout crowd of 19,563 in Madison Square Garden screamed with hope when Teresa Weatherspoon made two free throws with 52.3 seconds remaining to put the Liberty behind by only 52-50. But the sublime emerged once again, in the form of Cynthia Cooper.</p>
        <p>Cooper carved a path along the baseline and floated an underhand 10-footer that fell into the basket, lifting Houston back to its lofty perch.</p>
        <p>Cooper drew a foul, too, and cleanly dropped the shot, leaving the Liberty players awestruck. And then crushed.</p>
        <p>In the four-year history of the Women's National Basketball Association, there has been only one champion and one most valuable player of the league championship series: the Comets and Cooper, respectively.</p>
        <p>Cooper played like an M.V.P. last night and her team played like champions. After Houston's 59-52 victory over the Liberty, the Comets can wrap up their fourth straight title tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Cooper scored 20 points and, despite going 7 of 23 in Game 1 of the W.N.B.A. finals, it was her scooped layup that gave the Comets an insurmountable lead with 26.4 seconds remaining. Her two free throws sealed the victory.</p>
        <p>But it was the timing from Cooper, a two-time Olympian, that made the difference. In an arena where so many players have knifed the home team with a clutch shot, it seemed appropriate that a 37-year-old Cooper, who announced her retirement at the end of the season, made hers as well.</p>
        <p>''Cynthia Cooper made one of the greatest shots you will ever see,'' Houston Coach Van Chancellor said. ''That is the play of the game. No question about it.''</p>
        <p>Tina Thompson, who scored 15 points for the Comets, thought her coach might have exaggerated his description of Cooper's shot, not exactly a thing of beauty. ''I have definitely seen her make a lot of shots that were more exciting than that,'' Thompson said.</p>
        <p>The two-of-three-game series will shift to Houston for the weekend. At the Compaq Center, the Comets have lost only one playoff game -- last year, when Teresa Weatherspoon heaved a halfcourt shot at the buzzer.</p>
        <p>There were no miracles last night. The Liberty never once led in this game, playing stifling defense that took its toll on the offensive end. For four years, the Liberty has been following the Comets' trail. Now, the Liberty is again a loss from ending its season one goal short, thanks to Cooper and her teammates.</p>
        <p>''It seemed like it wasn't enough; it didn't really flow at times,'' Tari Phillips said of the Liberty's effort. ''We had some great defensive moments out there. But when we made some mistakes, they key off that and make you pay for it. Cooper made a very difficult shot. This bit us, set us back, but we're determined.''</p>
        <p>Besides Cooper and Thompson, Sheryl Swoopes scored 12 for Houston.</p>
        <p>Cooper spoke of the emotion of playing her last game in the Garden, but it was the playoff game itself that brought her to another level. ''I have always stepped it up for the playoffs,'' she said. ''And the playoffs is where you have to do that. I felt like we needed a bucket. I missed easier ones earlier -- I was fortunate enough for it to go in. I needed to take it upon myself to be the leader and really put the game out of reach for them down the stretch.''</p>
        <p>With 4:04 to play, Phillips's turnaround jumper made it 52-48. Neither team could score for the next three minutes. The Comets' center Tammy Jackson had a big block on Phillips's shot with 1:34 to play. Cooper then missed three straight shots, as did the Liberty, until Weatherspoon's free throws closed the margin to 2.</p>
        <p>Phillips. had game-high 24 points and 15 rebounds and sparked the second-half comeback. But no other Liberty player scored in double figures. Cooper defended Becky Hammon, the Liberty's shooting guard, who made only one of five shots and turned an ankle late in the game. Tamika Whitmore made only 1 of her 11 shots.</p>
        <p>''Still, we held them to 59 points and only lost by 7 points,'' said the Liberty's Vickie Johnson, who scored 6 points.</p>
        <p>The Liberty came out of the locker room at halftime determined to erase the 7-point deficit. Phillips scored two straight baskets to bring New York within 3.</p>
        <p>But the Comets got its lead to 12 when the Liberty started to rush its shots. When the Liberty threatened again after Johnson's jumper at the 13:14 mark brought New York within 5, Cooper seemed to close the door with a wide-open 3-pointer, catching the Liberty out of sync in transition. In four years, it has never been wise to leave Cooper unguarded.</p>
        <p>She scored Houston's first 7 points of the game, exploding through the lane, taking perhaps an extra step to remember the Garden and earning a Jordanesque farewell party along the way.</p>
        <p>And in large part to her 11 first-half points, Houston never trailed in that half.</p>
        <p>Because of Cooper's final basket, Houston now leads the series.</p>
