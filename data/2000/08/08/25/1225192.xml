        <p>WHEN he was managing for the O'Malley family, Tom Lasorda used to preach that his blood was Dodger blue. It was a great shtick that earned him considerable television time in his early years.</p>
        <p>But now Lasorda is talking red, white and blue, and his perennial bluster is muted as he talks proudly about patriotism.</p>
        <p>''My father used to sit at the head of the table and tell us, 'You ought to thank God you were born in the U.S.,' '' Lasorda said.</p>
        <p>He invokes the memory of his father, Sabatino, born in a little town in the Abruzzi, the hardscrabble region to the east of Rome, over toward the Adriatic Sea.</p>
        <p>''My father fought for Italy in World War I, and came over when he was 21,'' Lasorda said the other day.</p>
        <p>Not needing to footnote that Italy wound up on the other side in World War II, Lasorda recalled how ''the Germans put all these guns up in the hills in Tollo, where my father came from, 12 miles from Pescara. The Americans came in and leveled the place.''</p>
        <p>For the Lasorda family, then living in the Philadelphia area, there were no ambiguities. They were Americans.</p>
        <p>''He would tell us in his broken English, 'You may be called on to serve your country. You may be called on to fight. You may be called on to give up your life,' '' Lasorda recalled. ''He said it would be an honor.''</p>
        <p>Lasorda calls himself fortunate that he never had to bleed for his country. It is no sacrifice at all for him to manage the United States baseball team in the Summer Games in Sydney.</p>
        <p>''This is bigger than the World Series! Bigger than Major League Baseball! Bigger than the Dodgers!'' shouts Lasorda, whose speech demands to be defined by exclamation points.</p>
        <p>Lasorda will have no Garvey, no Fernando, no Dusty, but he expects nothing less than a gold medal from these prospects and journeymen. He will surely reprise the old gall and bluster he used on his Dodgers in the 1980's, acting as if they were participating in Grade B war movies.</p>
        <p>When Lasorda tried to replace Corporal Jay Johnstone on defense during a September game, Johnstone growled, ''Nuts to you, Tommy, I ain't coming out,'' and bolted back to the outfield as Lasorda chortled.</p>
        <p>When Private Mickey Hatcher led cheers like a U.C.L.A. pompom girl, Captain Lasorda swelled with blue Dodger pride.</p>
        <p>And when the bureaucrats suspended one of his best men, Lasorda rallied the troops. The other day, he recalled a pivotal moment, when the future of the world -- or at least Chavez Ravine -- hung in the balance.</p>
        <p>He recalled how his best relief pitcher, Jay Howell, was detected using pine tar, a substance that gives the ball an extra (and illegitimate) spin, during the 1988 championship series against the Mets. Howell was tossed out of the game and ultimately busted for two more games.</p>
        <p>''I told my guys, 'We're not gonna let the loss of one guy determine this series,' '' Lasorda recalled. ''I said, 'We're all gonna have to dig in.' That was when Hershiser closed for me.''</p>
        <p>Late the next night, Specialist Orel Hershiser, deceptively bespectacled and mild-mannered, volunteered to come out of the bullpen in the 12th inning, saving the Dodgers' stunning Game 4 victory, and sending them toward a world championship. Lasorda had already nicknamed him Bulldog.</p>
        <p>He will surely have nicknames for his mix-and-match assortment that will not have it easy in Sydney. He will try to drag flashbacks from retreads like Pat Borders and a few others who have had a taste of the majors.</p>
        <p>The Cubans, who won the first two gold medals, in Barcelona and Atlanta, will be back. Japan may bring as many as eight players from their two major leagues, including the hot young pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka of the Seibu Lions. And South Korea is closing down its pro league the way the National Hockey League did for the 1998 Winter Games.</p>
        <p>''I'm telling you right now, we're not gonna go 6,000 miles to lose,'' Lasorda said over the telephone, so emphatically that one could envision his index finger jabbing the air.</p>
        <p>The son of an immigrant from the Abruzzi can appreciate the links between nations.</p>
        <p>Like Looie Carnesecca, the ambassador of basketball from St. John's University, Lasorda has gone back to his ancestral homeland to teach his sport. The Italians have learned well, and are one of the eight qualifying nations for these Games.</p>
        <p>''We play Italy on Sept. 22,'' Lasorda said. ''Olympic Stadium! What an honor! It's my birthday!''</p>
