        <p>Venus Williams played only a bit better yesterday than she did in winning her opening match at the Pilot Pen tournament in New Haven. Still, it was good enough for her to beat Patty Schnyder, 6-4, 6-2, and advance to today's semifinals.</p>
        <p>After winning her 17th consecutive match, Williams, the defending champion, conceded that she sometimes had trouble lifting her game against lesser opponents.</p>
        <p>If I'm playing a top 10 player, for sure I'm going to play better, said the 20-year-old Williams, who has won three tournaments in a row starting with Wimbledon in July.</p>
        <p>Williams, who will meet fifth-seeded Amanda Coetzer in the semifinals, certainly dropped the level of her play against the 21-year-old Schnyder, a former top 10 player now ranked 28th.</p>
        <p>After taking a 2-0 lead, Williams lost her service three times in a row to enable Schnyder to take a 4-3 lead. By then Williams had committed 20 unforced errors and had four double faults.</p>
        <p>Williams managed to run off the last three games to take the set. In the second set, she committed only seven unforced errors.</p>
        <p>Williams, whose three defeats this year -- all on clay -- include one to Coetzer, said she was not concerned during the opening set.</p>
        <p>''I think what happens is that I get a little too relaxed and a little too confident,'' Williams said. ''Even when I get behind, I feel like I'm going to win the match.''</p>
