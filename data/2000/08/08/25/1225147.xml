        <p>The Arizona Diamondbacks didn't know when they were well off. They certainly didn't know their place. Win a division championship in their second season of existence, will they? Yeah, we'll teach those uppity Southwesterners.</p>
        <p>The Diamondbacks come to Shea Stadium tonight for a three-game series with the Mets, two and a half games from the spot they held in the National League West at the end of last season and four and a half games behind the Mets in the wild-card race. They arrive not only in danger of failing to repeat their postseason visit but also surrounded by questions about their manager's future and their own.</p>
        <p>''We're fighting off the wolves,'' Jerry Colangelo, the team's managing partner, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The wolves, in this instance, have press passes, the kind that entitle a holder to call for the dismissal of a manager. Manager Buck Showalter has his critics, but he is also the same fellow who presided over the fastest-ever division championship.</p>
        <p>''I've chosen to take the high ground,'' Showalter said in a telephone interview, discussing the criticism he has recently endured. ''I have a pretty good idea of what the agenda was there. I don't think it's worthwhile to address it. It happens to everybody. It's part of the job description. I live with it.''</p>
        <p>Showalter's managerial style invites scrutiny; it's easy to criticize. But his insistence on controlling everything that goes on in the clubhouse is part of the intense attention he pays to details, a characteristic that endeared him to George Steinbrenner until they underwent a messy divorce following the 1995 season.</p>
        <p>Showalter is old school. He has been criticized for having coaches tell Diamondbacks players not to talk to players on the other team during batting practice, but players once upon a time were fined for fraternizing with their opponents. Umpires would sit in the stands during batting practice and note the numbers of players from opposing teams who talked to each other. The numbers would go into the league offices, and fines would be levied.</p>
        <p>This is a different era, in which players are buddies, they earn millions more than their managers and they think they should have the right to do what they want, just like children everywhere. The high cost of baseball in this era has also made winning a requirement for continued employment. Sometimes even people who don't have a dollar invested in a club feel free to tell the owner what to do.</p>
        <p>''When I first got here, I saw criticism of Jerry,'' said Showalter, who has two years left on his seven-year contract. ''I said to myself, if they go after him, it's going to happen to all of us. We live in a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world. Your job as manager is to win championships. If you don't or you're not moving in that direction, you're going to get questions.''</p>
        <p>The Diamondbacks, despite injuries to key players, have only four fewer victories than they had in the same number of games last season, but the San Francisco Giants have six more victories, accounting for the teams' reversal in the standings.</p>
        <p>The 1999 Diamondbacks won 100 games, 35 more than their expansion counterparts. It was the biggest improvement, one season to the next, in baseball history. The division championship came with it. Given the grumbling in the desert, it was too much too soon. Maybe the Diamondbacks' followers would have prefered the loveable-loser kind of expansion team, as the Mets were in the early 60's.</p>
        <p>Colangelo spent freely on creating a contender. Now even his economics have come under scrutiny. Much was made recently of a loan the Diamondbacks secured, with the assistance of Major League Baseball. The loan was reported to be for $20 million, which Colangelo said was incorrect.</p>
        <p>Whatever the amount, the Diamondbacks won't be filing for bankruptcy anytime soon.</p>
        <p>''If you look at what's happening on the financial landscape,'' Colangelo said, ''with banks merging and consolidating, with our banking relationship, we needed to restructure some debt. We had to move some money over. That's what we're talking about here.''</p>
        <p>Then he added, referring to the Marlins' decimated 1997 World Series winners: ''This is not a Florida. We don't have a for-sale sign up. We'll be just fine.''</p>
        <p>But they will be finer if they can overtake the Mets for the wild card or the Giants for another division title. Injuries to key players and poor production from others have undermined the Diamondbacks' defense of their title. If they don't gain a postseason spot, will Showalter's job be in jeopardy?</p>
        <p>''I don't dwell on those things,'' he said. ''You do the best job you can do and be yourself. I have a lot of confidence in our organization and they do in me. You try to have a thick skin. It's a challenge managers have to overcome.''</p>
        <p>Colangelo was initially perceived as giving Showalter a lukewarm endorsement to continue as manager, but yesterday he said: ''Buck and I are fine. Buck knows that he is my manager. We invested a lot of money in a contract with him. We believe in him. He's made a major contribution. Why should I be responsive to a speculative story and give the so-called vote of confidence? It's insulting to be put in that position. He's my manager until he isn't. He knows he's accountable like everyone else and he accepts that.''</p>
