        <p>Vice President Al Gore entered a convention hall in Chicago on Tuesday afternoon to a raucous ovation from union carpenters that would have been hard to imagine during the many dark days of his lengthy campaign for the presidency.</p>
        <p>The union members, packed six deep behind rope lines, reached frantically toward Mr. Gore as he high-fived his way through the hall. At one point, he found himself almost spread-eagled as he reached for one hand beyond the rope line on his left and another beyond the line on his right.</p>
        <p>When he finally made it to the lectern, Mr. Gore put his hand over his heart in what seemed an earnestly emotional gesture and thanked the laborers for their welcome.</p>
        <p>''I felt a little bit like it was the Super Bowl,'' he said, ''and I was the last player introduced running through the gantlet of all the others.''</p>
        <p>That is a new feeling for Mr. Gore, whose campaign has struggled to catch a break through months of misfortune, some of it self-inflicted, some not. But in the last three weeks, as he has watched the country and the polls respond approvingly to his selection of a running mate, to his separation from President Clinton, to his speech to the Democratic National Convention, and to a picturesque postconvention cruise down the Mississippi, Mr. Gore is finally in a political groove.</p>
        <p>It has clearly made him a better candidate, firmer in his purpose, confident in his message, comfortable in his skin. And it has happened not just at an opportune moment, but also at a critical one. If Mr. Gore had emerged from the convention without this kind of lift, not just in the polls but also in the energy of his crowds and his campaign, the race might well have been lost. As it is, if Mr. Gore defeats Gov. George W. Bush in November, historians will undoubtedly see this period as a turning point.</p>
        <p>And voter surveys released yesterday show that Mr. Gore is on a roll, erasing Mr. Bush's lead nationwide and receiving good news in several crucial states. He has pulled even in Michigan and has increased his lead in New Jersey and California.</p>
        <p>For the moment at least, the transformation has reinforced the legend of Mr. Gore as a political clutch performer. And it has been all the more striking because it has coincided with a rare moment of off-message unsteadiness for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>After such prolonged adversity for Mr. Gore's campaign -- the scandals involving Monica Lewinsky and campaign fund-raising, the perceived pandering on Elian Gonzalez, the constant tweaking of message and image, the profligate spending, the bickering at headquarters -- Democrats and Republicans alike have noticed the difference.</p>
        <p>Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster not affiliated with the Gore campaign, conducted a focus group on Wednesday night in a St. Louis suburb and was amazed by the shifting perceptions of Mr. Gore. The voters interviewed, Mr. Hart said, now see Mr. Gore more as a leader and less as Mr. Clinton's subordinate. They understand his agenda, he said, and can express reasons to vote for Mr. Gore, not simply against Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''It was remarkable,'' Mr. Hart said. ''Gore's lift off the convention is much more than a numerical lift. It's a platform and a platform for him to build upon.''</p>
        <p>William Kristol, a Republican strategist and the publisher of The Weekly Standard, said Mr. Gore had benefited immensely from the transition of the Democratic ticket from Clinton-Gore to Gore-Lieberman. And Mr. Kristol said Mr. Gore had demonstrated boldness by selecting Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running mate and by using his convention speech to lay out a forward-looking agenda.</p>
        <p>''Bush may actually have to win this campaign now instead of just watching Gore lose it,'' Mr. Kristol said, ''and that's starting to sink in with some Republicans.''</p>
        <p>That being said, both Mr. Hart and Mr. Kristol emphasized that such moments could be transitory and that Mr. Gore could squander his newfound appeal by returning to a plodding, awkward form of his not so distant past.</p>
        <p>But for the time being, Mr. Gore is having fun. On his riverboat trip down the Mississippi, he stood atop the upper deck and waved boyishly to hikers on the distant bluffs. Like Mr. Clinton, he has discovered the joy of wading into crowds and lingering along a rope line. He grabs pens to sign T-shirts and, at one stop this week, a cantaloupe. The raspy hoarseness that afflicted him all week made him sound positively Clintonesque.</p>
        <p>Last Saturday night, Mr. Gore broke a deep freeze with his campaign press corps by inviting reporters to an off-the-record gathering on the riverboat. It went so well that he invited the reporters back for another get-together on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore cannot always excite a crowd purely with the force of his personality. But Mr. Gore can take the energy from a crowd and make it his own.</p>
        <p>His crowds, while not approaching the 25,000 that showed for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore in St. Louis on their 1992 bus tour, have been respectable in their size and expressive in their support. In little Keokuk, Iowa, on Sunday night, some 2,000 people waited in a park for his arrival at 10:10 p.m., about an hour late.</p>
        <p>Those who travel to see him say they find Mr. Gore to be down-to-earth, a trait not always associated with him in the past. Debbie L. Mundy, a self-employed house cleaner who listened to Mr. Gore in Moline, Ill., last Sunday, said she would vote for him at least partly because the new prosperity had provided plenty of work for her husband, a union electrician. But she also said she and others in the area now viewed Mr. Gore as he wants them to -- as his own man with his own message.</p>
        <p>''We wouldn't have all these people here otherwise,'' she said at a rally that jammed a downtown street. ''I think everybody's trying to get in close to get a look at him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore does, in fact, seem comfortable with his message. He explains it forcefully, but without the shouting that once seemed so contrived. The recent prosperity has been great, he says, but some have been left out, and he will broaden the impact through tax cuts and new spending aimed at the middle class. The enemy, he makes it clear, is not big government but selected big industries, including oil, insurance and pharmaceuticals.</p>
        <p>A CBS News poll taken just after the Democratic convention, one of several that now show Mr. Gore with a slight lead, found that 61 percent of those questioned said Mr. Gore was articulating what he wanted to accomplish. In a poll taken two weeks earlier, only 36 percent said so.</p>
        <p>''Whether his message works or not I don't know,'' said Charles O. Jones, a retired political scientist at the University of Wisconsin. ''But at least you can fathom that they have a strategy. Before, they seemed to have been all over the place.''</p>
        <p>Another factor has been Mr. Lieberman, the Connecticut senator and a friend of Mr. Gore's for 15 years. He clearly puts the Vice President at ease and his sense of humor encourages Mr. Gore to show his own. The public approval of the selection has given Mr. Gore confidence in his own judgment, and after eight years as second fiddle he seems to relish sitting in the first chair. The two men plan to campaign together a lot, often on ''double dates'' with their popular wives.</p>
        <p>And so, the Gore campaign moves toward Labor Day with the sense that it is clicking on all cylinders, at least for now.</p>
        <p>''This campaign,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's press secretary, ''was like a car where you turn the engine and it almost catches and almost catches. And then, last week, it finally caught.''</p>
