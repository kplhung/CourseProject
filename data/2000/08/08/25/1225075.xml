        <p>THEY call it the Nightmare. That is how the crew refers to the sequence in which the metal embassy fence drops in, the helipad moves down, the sound of whipping blades intensifies, and a life-size chopper descends.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 31, American troops will evacuate Saigon this way for the last time on the stage of the Broadway Theater, bringing to a close the musical ''Miss Saigon,'' the sixth-longest-running show in Broadway history. After nearly 10 years, the production, loosely based on Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' will have played 4,063 performances and gone through 1,218,900 pounds of dry ice, 89,386 scene changes and 812,600 light cues.</p>
        <p>''Miss Saigon'' has taken in more than $1.3 billion internationally at the box office since its world premiere in London in September 1989. The Broadway production, which opened on April 11, 1991, has grossed more than $266 million and has been seen by nearly six million people.</p>
        <p>The show spawned two United States touring companies and a Toronto production. ''Saigon'' has been performed in six other countries, and a new production will open in the Philippines next month, starring Lea Salonga, who originated the title role on Broadway.</p>
        <p>The show's imminent departure is significant, and not only because ''Miss Saigon'' is the most technically complex show in Broadway history, or because it broke several records during its phenomenal run, like the largest advance ticket sale ($37 million) and highest ticket price ever for a musical at the time ($100). With ''Cats'' scheduled to close next month, the departure of ''Miss Saigon'' leaves just two in a crop of mega-musicals still running -- ''Les Miserables'' and ''The Phantom of the Opera'' -- suggesting that an era of theatrical spectacle may be at an end.</p>
        <p>With musicals now costing $5 million to $12 million to mount, many producers say they would not attempt a ''Miss Saigon'' today. (The show cost $10.9 million in 1991.)</p>
        <p>Written by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg (who wrote ''Les Miserables''), with additional lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr., and produced by the British impresario Cameron Mackintosh, ''Miss Saigon'' is also a landmark in that it was the first successful musical to deal with the sensitive subject of Vietnam.</p>
        <p>In addition, the production originally engendered considerable controversy when Sir Cameron clashed with the Actors Equity Association over casting: the union insisted on an Asian actor for the major role of the Engineer, a Eurasian pimp, while Sir Cameron insisted on Jonathan Pryce -- initially canceling the production -- and ultimately prevailed. But ''Miss Saigon'' has proved to be a source of steady income for Asian actors, who often find work hard to come by on Broadway.</p>
        <p>Its Own Following</p>
        <p>Those who have been with the musical the longest say they are in no position to mourn its passing. After all, most shows don't last even a year on Broadway. And ''Miss Saigon'' just kept on going.</p>
        <p>''Because it was the last great blockbuster of the 80's, it had all that sort of media-frenzied hype behind it,'' Sir Cameron said. ''Therefore, it wasn't until the dust had settled that actually the audience decided to like it for itself. To this day it has its own following.''</p>
        <p>While the production is best known for its special effects, it is the poignancy of the love story between Kim, a Vietnamese waif forced to work as a prostitute after witnessing the death of her parents in the war, and Chris, an American G.I. compelled to leave Saigon on the last helicopter out, that seems to explain why the musical has run so long.</p>
        <p>''I think what happened was, there was an appetite for what opera has always done well,'' said Nicholas Hytner, who directed the show, ''which is to dramatize large passions in some people set against a sweeping historical background.''</p>
        <p>In his review of the show in The New York Times, Frank Rich wrote, ''For all that seems galling about 'Miss Saigon' -- and for all that is indeed simplistic, derivative and, at odd instances, laughable about it -- this musical is a gripping entertainment of the old school.''</p>
        <p>While audiences may be moved by the tale and its tragic ending, they are also awed by the element of spectacle, with sets by John Napier, lighting by David Hersey, sound by Andrew Bruce and costumes by Andreane Neofitou and Suzy Benzinger. In addition to the famous 1,700-pound helicopter (often derided as too Disneyland), the show features an 18-foot fiberglass statue of Ho Chi Minh and a real 1959 Cadillac, cut in half to fit backstage. The crew is bigger than the cast, 55 to 46. There are 375 costumes, 206 props, 45 firearms, including handguns, M-16's and AK-47's. The touring company that closed this month in Buffalo required 40 tractor-trailers.</p>
        <p>'' 'Phantom' had been the largest automated show,'' said Jake Bell, the show's production technical manager. '' 'Saigon' surpassed that by more than double.''</p>
        <p>Experiencing a matinee from behind the scenes offers a glimpse into what it takes to make this monster of a show work its magic.</p>
        <p>Busy in the Wings</p>
        <p>The action begins a half-hour before the curtain goes up. The last of the actors enter through the stage door, sign in and head up to their dressing rooms to get into their wigs, makeup and costumes.</p>
        <p>On the cool, cavernous stage and in the wings, the crew readies the props and scenery. Set pieces that have been left on the stage from the close of the show the night before -- like the runway for the Moulin Rouge strip club in Bangkok, where the story moves in Act II -- are moved into the wings and, in most cases, flown, which means they are strung up on chain hoists to keep the limited wing space as clear as possible. Act I sets and props are moved onto the deck -- meaning the stage and wings -- including bicycles and details for the wedding shrine: incense, candles and colorful hanging unicorns.</p>
        <p>''It's like rotating stock in a store,'' said Andrew Douglas, the assistant propertyman.</p>
        <p>Because of the tight space, large pieces of scenery must be constantly moved around in the wings to allow others to get on and off the stage. The towering Ho statue, for example, gets shifted from side to side at the rear of the stage like a pendulum clock throughout the performance. Then there are the five different beds to keep track of: Kim 1 Bed, Kim 2 Bed, Kim 3 Bed, Kim 4 Bed and Hotel Bed.</p>
        <p>In addition there are the smaller details to account for, like the basket of lacquered vegetables (exactly what kind is a matter of backstage debate: zucchini, okra, bitter melon?), stacks of fake dollar bills, carts with hanging fish and trays of jewelry.</p>
        <p>With so many sets rising and descending in the wings, backstage can be a dicey place to be. ''Organized chaos,'' said Peter Wolf, the first assistant stage manager. To make room for all of the show's big bells and whistles, the theater first had to be transformed. Jack Cennamo, 61, the head carpenter, who has been with ''Miss Saigon'' since it began, said he and his crew spent two months tearing out walls, radiators and stairwells.</p>
        <p>During the performance, the stagehands are particularly concerned with how the scenery moves on and off. ''It's routine,'' Mr. Cennamo said of running the show. ''But you have to pay attention.''</p>
        <p>There are 19 muslin blinds that look as if they were made of rice paper and frame the stage. Behind them is black masking through which scenery glides in and out on metal pylons that are meant to evoke Vietnam. The rising of the blinds is carried out by one of the show's three computers, which occupy a room of their own. If a computer malfunctions and the blinds don't go up, the pylons carrying the scenery rip through them and the stagehands have a problem. It has happened, but not often.</p>
        <p>Coordinating all this, calling the cues, is Mark Dobrow, the production stage manager, who has been with ''Miss Saigon'' for five years. Outside the office he shares with his assistant stage managers -- Mr. Wolf and Lisa Buxbaum, the second assistant -- Polaroid pictures cover the walls, featuring every cast member who has been with the company, almost 300 over the years. Each of them signed the show's coolie hat upon leaving.</p>
        <p>The role of Kim's son, Tam, has been played by 34 different 4- and 5-year-olds, mostly girls. ''Boys, when they're 4, are not mature enough,'' Mr. Dobrow said. ''They get bored really easily.''</p>
        <p>The 'Child Wrangler'</p>
        <p>Looking after this child is a chaperone, or ''child wrangler,'' currently Suzanne Arnold, who stays by her charge's side throughout the show. When Tam (played by Jenna La Salla and Gail A. Quintos, who alternate performances) is offstage, Ms. Arnold entertains the child in the dressing room with games, storybooks and toys. When Tam is onstage, Ms. Arnold is nearby, out of sight of the audience. When, for example, Tam is sitting on a bed (Kim 3 Bed) that is curtained off, waiting to make her entrance, Ms. Arnold sits beside the girl, telling her jokes or reading aloud.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolf is in charge of training the new Tams, who generally stay 3 to 10 months. Rather than explain the entire show to a 4-year-old, Mr. Wolf has given each of Tam's scenes names. So when Tam first enters by running from the bed to his mother, that is called the ''Tam Run Game.'' When Kim shoots her cousin with a gun to protect Tam, that is the ''Tam Bang Game.''</p>
        <p>The stagehands have developed joke names for some of the grown-up scenes, too. The one in which the men enter wearing sandals, for example, is called ''the flip-flop boys.''</p>
        <p>In the locker room under the stage before the show, the actors playing soldiers get dressed in their Army gear, attaching their microphones, draping dog tags around their necks. Ray Santos, one of the original cast members who plays a Vietnamese customer in the first bar scene, says he values this time the most. ''We make each other laugh,'' he said, ''talk about things outside of the show.''</p>
        <p>All shows become families; this one has become a dynasty. Cast members have left and come back, borne children, married one another. Tams have grown up, and their younger siblings have become Tams.</p>
        <p>'Here We Go Again'</p>
        <p>It is nearing 2 p.m.: showtime. Gradually actors wander onto the stage to stretch and chat before the curtain goes up. Mr. Dobrow, the stage manager, stands at his podium in front of a script with marked cues, puts on his headset and announces in low tones: ''We're at places. Places, please.''</p>
        <p>Then he checks in with all the other departments on headsets: automation, carpentry, electronics, sound, his fellow stage managers, the house manager who monitors the audience. Robert Billig, the show's musical director, who is conducting today and visible on backstage infrared monitors, reports on the number of substitutes in his orchestra, so the sound man knows what to expect. ''Count is 12,'' Mr. Billig says of the subs. ''One cello, two violins, an oboe, Asian flute. . . .''</p>
        <p>Michael Harris, the house manager, reports, ''House is ready.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Douglas, the propertyman, says, ''Here we go again.''</p>
        <p>The show begins in Saigon, 1975, with a sequence the crew has come to refer to as ''Dreamland,'' in which Kim and Chris meet for the first time in a nightclub. Then the show moves to Kim's hut (Kim 1 Bed), then on to Ho Chi Minh City, 1978.</p>
        <p>The actors onstage look sharp, as if they were performing these songs and dances for the first time. But keeping it fresh is a challenge, especially for those who have been with the show the longest.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes it's near impossible,'' said Alan Ariano, an original member of the ensemble. ''I blank out sometimes and go on automatic: 'O.K., did I do the laundry?' You catch yourself, have to snap yourself out of it.''</p>
        <p>A Gold Mine for Asians</p>
        <p>Mr. Ariano said he had supplemented his ''Miss Saigon'' life with a photography business, shooting theatrical head shots, and more recently with a degree in computer graphics. Knowing that no show lasts forever, and that there may not be another one immediately to follow, he said he wanted something to fall back on. ''What's next for me I don't know,'' he said. ''The nature of this business is job insecurity.''</p>
        <p>The business is doubly insecure for Asian actors, who say they must rely on productions like ''The King and I''  and ''M. Butterfly'' to get work. In this light ''Miss Saigon'' has been something of a gold mine, employing actors of Filipino, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese and Hawaiian descent as well as black and Hispanic performers. ''Both the professional and the public view of minority casting, nontraditional casting, colorblind casting has taken a terrific leap forward,'' said Alan Wasser, the show's general manager.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ariano and Francis J. Cruz, two original cast members, attended the same high school in Chula Vista, Calif. ''We've been part of an elite group that's been able to work'' in the theater, Mr. Ariano said. ''I don't take that for granted.''</p>
        <p>At intermission the crew prepares for the top of Act II, flying all the scenery from Act I up on the chain hoists, bringing down the Bangkok units. The act opens at a conference in the United States, 1978. Then it moves to Bangkok. Then it flashes back to Saigon when Kim remembers the American evacuation. In other words, the Nightmare.</p>
        <p>The helicopter is the sum of six separate automated effects. The boom arm can swing from side to side; the cab can pitch up and down, move side to side and rotate; the rotor on top is a nylon rope with a rubber ball on the end that is ejected, creating the illusion of a spinning blade. At the controls is Virgil, a robot whose head turns as the helicopter lands.</p>
        <p>When the chopper settles on the helipad, it is up to Ms. Buxbaum, one of the stage managers, to signal the live co-pilot (hidden on the pad) to come through the helicopter, motioning the rest of the soldiers to climb aboard. The 13 men who scramble into the helicopter actually drop into the hollow box of the pad, lined with two benches, handing off their rifles to a prop man as they descend. Ms. Buxbaum holds a flashlight in her mouth to light their way.</p>
        <p>Then Ms. Buxbaum reports, ''All clear'' into her headset, and the helicopter rises into the eaves. ''It's really cool to be onstage when the helicopter is coming down,'' said Eva Schegulla, Kim's dresser. ''After four years I still get a kick out of it every day.''</p>
        <p>Usually this all goes smoothly. But there have been exceptions. Like the time the helicopter didn't take off. Fortunately the automation guys were able to run the machinery from a dial on the encoder, as opposed to going through the computer, controlling each effect individually. But there have been times when the helicopter didn't work at all, and for such times there is Plan B, which essentially amounts to blinding the audience with light and adding a lot of smoke. Remarkably, audiences who have experienced Plan B have apparently found it satisfying. ''They think they've seen something,'' Mr. Dobrow said.</p>
        <p>Initially Mr. Hytner, the director, did not think the helicopter was at all essential, though he now says he is glad it is there. ''I thought, 'Oh, we don't need this,' '' he recalled. ''But it's not necessarily about what you need.''</p>
        <p>Once the impact of the helicopter has receded, the show returns to its human drama, as Kim encounters Chris's wife in a hotel room. Downstairs in the green room, members of the cast settle in for the matinee ritual of ''Asian Treat.''</p>
        <p>It started about 10 years ago when a dresser began bringing fruit and drinks for the male cast members she attended to. This mushroomed into an exclusive group of about 14 members who take turns bringing snacks for the matinees. Only members can partake. A sign nearby explains the rules of the Asian Food Treat Club: ''Anyone is welcome to be part of the club after having contributed to the festivities and having passed the requirements specified by the A.F.T.C. board of directors at the time of one's application -- just kidding!''</p>
        <p>Today the menu includes crackers, brie and dip, and the members, from the cast and crew, dive in while the non-members eye the spread hungrily from the sidelines.</p>
        <p>A New Job</p>
        <p>In the hair room, John James, who has been hair supervisor for seven years, is putting the female cast members into their blond wigs for the ''American Dream'' number. Sparkly in their glittering fringe and white fishnet stockings, the women congratulate Lisa Yuen, an ensemble member, on her new job: she will be leaving ''Miss Saigon'' to join the road company of ''The Scarlet Pimpernel.''</p>
        <p>This news is clearly bittersweet; cast members know they need to figure out what to do next, and those landing jobs before the end of the run feel lucky. But it also offers a sobering reminder to the actors who remain that the end is near. On Nov. 2, a gala featuring ''Miss Saigon'' alumni will celebrate the show's 4,000th performance. The New Year's Eve show will be the last.</p>
        <p>''They're happy that she got another job, but sad that she won't be there when it ends,'' said Mr. James. ''You can just feel that people are pulling away emotionally, trying to find what to do next and where to go next. Is there life after 'Saigon'?''</p>
        <p>Mr. James said he was concerned about the future, too. ''I'm a little worried,'' he said. ''This is the first time I've ever had to face unemployment.''</p>
        <p>Onstage the ''American Dream'' number has its usual buoyant effect on the audience, particularly because of the Cadillac -- carrying a woman in a Statue of Liberty crown that lights up -- which seems to float downstage on a cloud (read: dry ice). Mr. Maltby, who collaborated on the lyrics, said that this showstopping number goes to the heart of the play.</p>
        <p>On to Heartbreak</p>
        <p>''Vietnam was a turning point in America's estimation of itself, and the American dream, which hovers over the whole show, is what was at stake,'' he said. ''America has never believed in the American dream after that event. Prior to that we were always the good guys, and we always won. Suddenly we were the bad guys doing terrible things, and, worse than that, John Wayne didn't come riding over the hill to save the day.</p>
        <p>''The show in its essence is about that, about the American inability to make the leap to Vietnam, to understand it and to ultimately help.''</p>
        <p>Today's matinee moves to its heartbreaking conclusion, accompanied by surging notes from the orchestra. Kitschy perhaps, but some in the audience are crying. The cast comes on for its curtain call, bowing between the billow and the bang of the heavy red velvet curtain as it rises and falls. ''I think they loved it,'' one actor quips as she comes offstage, ''and we should do it again, tonight.''</p>
        <p>Just two and half hours later -- the show runs more than two and a half hours with intermission -- all of these people will be back to do it all over again, almost exactly as they did it before. For them this is work: what they wake up and do every day except Sunday, sometimes twice a day, to feed their families, afford vacations, pay the rent. They casually head out the stage door to their dinner breaks, showing no trace of having weathered something wrenching.</p>
        <p>The audience, on the other hand, emerges dazed, the way people do coming out of a movie in the middle of the afternoon, taking a moment to recover and re-enter their real lives, blinking in the sunlight.</p>
        <p>Copter Landings</p>
