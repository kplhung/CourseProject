        <p>''Ju know what I ang? A clee-tchay.'' So says Raul Ventana (Miguel Sandoval), the Hispanic drug kingpin who is the designated heavy in Michael Dinner's slapdash, hyperactive new mobster comedy. ''Ju know what happens to clee-tchays?'' Ventana asks his minions, who look grateful to be back at work after the long hiatus of ''Miami Vice.'' ''They die.''</p>
        <p>Not so, amigo. ''The Crew,'' with morbid relish, takes defibrillator paddles to pop-culture archetypes and situations that should have been allowed to expire peacefully long ago.

        <p>''Ju know what I ang? A clee-tchay.'' So says Raul Ventana (Miguel Sandoval), the Hispanic drug kingpin who is the designated heavy in Michael Dinner's slapdash, hyperactive new mobster comedy. ''Ju know what happens to clee-tchays?'' Ventana asks his minions, who look grateful to be back at work after the long hiatus of ''Miami Vice.'' ''They die.''</p>
        <p>Not so, amigo. ''The Crew,'' with morbid relish, takes defibrillator paddles to pop-culture archetypes and situations that should have been allowed to expire peacefully long ago. The inexplicable success of ''Analyze This'' and the unlikely, richly merited triumph of ''The Sopranos'' seem to have illuminated dim light bulbs over the heads of Barry Sonnenfeld and Barry Josephson, the film's producers, and the good people at Touchstone Pictures.</p>
        <p>By the time Ventana delivers his commentary, we have seen a parade of dark suits, fedoras and cigars, strippers doing pole dances, bodies in the trunks of cars, and a cascade of ethnic stereotypes as vivid as third-generation photocopies of an old Don Rickles routine.</p>
        <p>A carefully edited one, to be sure. ''The Crew'' pokes fun at Latinos, Italian-Americans, Jews and the elderly but leaves blacks and gays alone; or rather, it tries to have affectionate fun with the ways its selected target groups have been made fun of in past movies and television shows. And some of it is, I'll admit, pretty funny.</p>
        <p>The script was written by Barry Fanaro, screenwriter of the Farrelly brothers' ''Kingpin,'' which will someday be acknowledged as a masterpiece of 1990's neo-lowbrow American cinema. ''The Crew'' occasionally pops to life with a priceless throwaway line (as when the Brothers Grimm are referred to as ''a couple of Nazi goniffs'') or an inspired set piece (like the sequence in which Ventana's senile and extravagantly wrinkled father breaks out of the nursing home, or the ''Goodfellas'' parody in which geriatric mobsters try to bribe their way into the early-bird special at a Miami delicatessen).</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fanaro also wrote more than 100 episodes of ''The Golden Girls,'' which is more to the point. Like that redoubtable show, ''The Crew'' aims to be a piece of genial old-timers' slapstick. It follows a gang of New Jersey wiseguys -- seen in their prime in an opening sequence set in 1968 -- into unhappy, impoverished and sexually frustrated old age. Except for Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss), who delivers a voice-over narration studded with ''mooks,'' ''fahzools,'' and ''fuhgeddaboudits,'' each member is defined by a colorful wiseguy nickname and a single personality trait. Bats (Burt Reynolds) has a violent temper; Mouth (Seymour Cassel) never talks; and the Brick (Dan Hedaya) is, as Bobby puts it, ''about 10 Lucky Strikes short of a pack.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hedaya deserves credit for bringing his dingbat character to comic life, the way he did as Nick Tortelli, his recurring scuzzball on ''Cheers.'' And Mr. Dreyfuss works hard to be both wiseguy and mensch, though his trademark intelligence is stymied by the dumbness of the script.</p>
        <p>But what in creation possessed the filmmakers to cast Mr. Reynolds as a mafioso, other than the fact that once, before much of the current film audience was born, he was hailed as the next Brando? In any case Mr. Reynolds, who has often mistaken lack of effort for effortlessness, sits around looking bored, except when he is knocked unconscious. The gag is that when he wakes up, Bats hatches the gang's next brilliant scheme. The movie seems to have been made by a similar method.</p>
        <p>''The Crew'' is cobbled together in desperate obedience to the widespread Hollywood fallacy that the more plot a movie has, the more people will like it. Thus in addition to nonsensical capers involving phony rub-outs, the accidental crossing of Raul Ventana, and the crew's entanglement with a buxom stripper named Ferris (Jennifer Tilly), there is the sentimental contrivance of Bobby's search for his lost daughter and some tired banter between two Miami detectives (Jeremy Piven and Carrie-Anne Moss) who are also ex-lovers, one of whom just happens to be . . .</p>
        <p>Just forget about it, O.K.?</p>
        <p>''The Crew'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes lecherous shots of women in bathing suits, some relatively tame gangster profanity and violence that tries to remain within the bounds of silliness.</p>
        <p>THE CREW</p>

Smith; music by Steve Bartek; production designer, Peter Larkin; produced by Barry Sonnenfeld and Barry Josephson; released by Touchstone Pictures. Running time: 88 minutes.
