        <p>Gov. George W. Bush sought to seize the offensive today on the issue of tax cuts, asserting that Vice President Al Gore's plan was so narrow and complicated that it would fail to lower taxes for many middle-class Americans.</p>
        <p>To make his case, Mr. Bush expanded his previously arranged schedule to include two events where he introduced families whose taxes, he said, would be lowered significantly under his own plan, but very little, if at all, under Mr. Gore's.</p>
        <p>''The so-called 'targeted' tax cut means that some are targeted out of tax relief,'' Mr. Bush said at an airport event in New Orleans, referring to Mr. Gore's plan.</p>
        <p>He cited the example of the man standing beside him, Andrew Bechac, a high school teacher and football coach who supports a wife and two young children on $40,000 a year. Mr. Bush said that if his tax cut was enacted, Mr. Bechac would pay the federal government $475 a year, about $1,600 less than he now does.</p>
        <p>In a later speech, Mr. Bush returned to the example of the Bechacs, making a more concrete pitch for his tax-cut proposal than he was  able to muster earlier in the week, when he stumbled over some numbers and then conceded that he had to do a better job of selling his plan.</p>
        <p>''Under my opponent's plan, he gets no tax cut,'' Mr. Bush said of Mr. Bechac. ''He gets no tax cut. I ask you, I ask Americans, to look at the facts in these tax plans.''</p>
        <p>In the evening, when Mr. Bush arrived in Miami, he introduced yet another family that he said would benefit under his plan.</p>
        <p>With these events and examples, which Mr. Gore's aides derided as selective and misleading, Mr. Bush was clearly trying to recover from his earlier missteps. At the same time, he sought to make light of those fumbles, which threw him off the education message that he had said he would be focusing on this week.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I didn't explain what I was trying to explain very well,'' he told reporters aboard his campaign plane, a smile on his face. Asked if he wanted to take another crack at it, he said, laughing, ''Yeah, exactly. Let me start over.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was also signaling that he was not going to back away from his proposal to cut taxes by about $1.3 trillion over the next decade, which many polls suggest may not be in line with the priorities of most American voters. Mr. Gore has proposed a more limited tax cut of $500 billion.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bush was confronting head on two of the principal obstacles to selling a big tax cut: many voters' belief that politicians are not really going to deliver the goods, or that the total savings would ultimately be pocket change.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bechac, a man with a history of activism in the Republican party in Louisiana, said at the airport event that $1,600 would ''go a long way for us each year.''</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Bush presented Mr. Bechac as a typical case, Mr. Gore's aides said he was an aberrant one.</p>
        <p>''They may have finally found one working family that does better under the Bush plan than the Gore plan,'' said Ron Klain, a senior adviser to Mr. Gore. ''While Governor Bush can play games with particular examples, he can't change the truth that most working families do better under Gore than Bush.''</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign quickly released an analysis suggesting that if the Bechacs did some of the things  that trigger tax breaks under the Gore plan -- like paying for day care for their children or taking a standard deduction instead of itemizing or putting money in certain kinds of savings accounts -- they might get an even bigger tax cut. The Bush campaign said that none of that was relevant to the Bechac family.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's plan cuts the income tax rate for all taxpayers in all income brackets, including the wealthiest Americans, who would get by far the most money back in simple dollar terms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's plan does not cut rates, but rather provides tax breaks for people who incur expenses for particular needs, like child care, elderly care and school tuition, or who are saving money for retirement or college. Those reductions in taxes apply, for the most part, only to families with combined incomes of less than $100,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides said today that because Mr. Gore's plan has an income ceiling and pivots on certain conditions, about 50 percent of taxpayers -- about 50 million people -- would not see their taxes lowered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klain said that only about 30 million taxpayers would not qualify for Mr. Gore's tax cuts.</p>
        <p>The back-and-forth over taxes suggested how large the issue could loom in this election. Mr. Gore and his aides have asserted that Mr. Bush's tax cut would gobble up surpluses and endanger prosperity. Mr. Bush and his aides have levied the same accusation about Mr. Gore's spending proposals, which are larger than Mr. Bush's.</p>
        <p>The Texas governor had previously employed the strategy of showcasing middle-class people and the kind of tax breaks they would get during his battle in the Republican primary against Senator John McCain of Arizona. Like Mr. Gore, Mr. McCain complained that Mr. Bush was lavishing too much of his tax cut on wealthy Americans.</p>
        <p>Aides said that Mr. Bush would continue throughout the coming weeks to introduce families like the Bechacs. But he had not, at the start of the week, intended to do that today, when he was also unveiling a new education proposal.</p>
        <p>It calls for $437 million more in federal financing over five years for historically black colleges and universities and an additional $166 million for similar institutions that have primarily served Hispanics.</p>
        <p>Even before his plane had left Austin, Tex., this morning, Mr. Bush was talking about tax cuts, saying that his belief in them was impervious to polls.</p>
        <p>''That should speak volumes about me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said a desire for tax cuts ''may not show up in that survey you read, but it's going to show up in this guy's wallet.''</p>
        <p>He was apparently referring to taxpayers like Larry Melow, who appeared in Miami with Mr. Bush, who said Mr. Melow's $3,458 federal tax bill would be reduced by about $2,100 under his proposal. Mr. Melow makes about $62,000 a year working for the State of Florida, where Mr. Bush's brother Jeb is governor.</p>
        <p>Earlier, at the New Orleans airport, Mr. Bechac held his 4-year-old daughter, Meredith, while Margaret Bechac held the couple's 1-year-old, Camille.</p>
        <p>Turning to Mr. Bechac, Mr. Bush said, ''Somebody asked me today on the plane, 'You know, the polls said people, hard-working people, don't want tax relief.' ''</p>
        <p>''And I mentioned that,'' Mr. Bush added, ''and I think your reaction was to laugh out loud.''</p>
