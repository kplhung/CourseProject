        <p>The State Department has asked the Agency for International Development to withdraw its registration from one of the largest Muslim charities in the United States, saying it has ties to the terrorist group Hamas, government officials say.</p>
        <p>Christopher Madison, a spokesman for the agency, said it had not officially heard from the department, but when it did, ''the agency's officials will take appropriate action.''</p>
        <p>But the agency has started to review how it registers charities and relief groups that work overseas, a procedure that allows the groups to get United States government grants and contracts. The agency has also stopped listing registered groups on its Web site until the review is completed, the agency said today.</p>
        <p>Officials said that the State Department's request was part of an effort to clamp down on charities and relief organizations suspected of being used to support Islamic terrorist organizations acting against American citizens. The effort was prompted by recent terrorist attacks and plots against Americans and American property.</p>
        <p>Officials said the aid agency had asked the State Department to produce evidence supporting its concerns about the Muslim charity, Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, an Islamic relief group based in Richardson, Tex. Government officials say one reason they suspect the group is tied to Hamas is that it provides support to families of suicide bombers.</p>
        <p>Israel, contending that the foundation was a front for Hamas, closed it and four other charities in May 1997. Earlier this year, the family of an American killed in a terrorist attack in Israel filed a civil suit against Holy Land, seeking monetary damages in what the suit contends is its  support of Hamas-inspired terrorism.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the foundation, Dalal Mohammed, said she was  surprised to learn of the State Department's request. ''We're in close cooperation with A.I.D.,'' Ms. Mohammed said.</p>
        <p>The charity, which says it raises about $6 million a year for the poor, mostly in the Palestinian Authority, has repeatedly denied an affiliation with Hamas or any terrorist group. It says it is the object of an Israeli vendetta, to deny charity to poor and needy Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
        <p>While Holy Land has not applied for federal grants, withdrawing its registration would prevent it from asserting, as it has in recent publications, that it has been ''accepted and certified'' by the aid agency.</p>
        <p>The request for the revocation came last week from the State Department's counterterrorism office, which told the agency that the charity's work was ''contrary to the national defense and foreign policy interests of the United States'' and because it provided indirect support to Hamas, officials said.</p>
        <p>A State Department official said an interagency committee was drafting new guidelines for vetting relief groups more meticulously to ensure that ''bad groups do not get recognition or money from the U.S. government.''</p>
        <p>As a result of its review, the agency might decide to stop registering private charities altogether, one official from the agency said.</p>
        <p>The registration procedures now are quite loose, the official said. None of the agency's eight requirements for registration specifically prohibits groups from supporting terrorism or engaging in activities that could damage American foreign policy interests.</p>
        <p>''The foundation seems to have taken advantage of some very sloppy registration procedures,'' the official said. ''That's why the requirements at the very least must be changed.''</p>
        <p>The agency approved the Holy Land Foundation's request for registration on June 29, despite the fact that the charity was included in a list of 30 Islamic relief groups that are the focus of government concern.</p>
        <p>The State Department request is yet another political embarrassment for the independent agency, which  reports directly to the secretary of state and which prominent senators and members of Congress tried to abolish several years ago.</p>
        <p>Last December, the agency, also at the State Department's request, revoked two grants worth $4.2 million to the Islamic African Relief Agency, a charity based in Columbia, Mo. Government officials asserted that the charity had ties to Sudan, which the State Department has identified as a sponsor of terrorism.</p>
        <p>Ahmed Mubarak, the organization's president, said at the time that the charity had ''nothing to do with Sudan'' and denied that it supported terrorism. Since then, the charity has challenged its suspension as unlawful.</p>
        <p>The aid agency's handling of its registration procedures shows how difficult it is for the government to restrict groups it suspects of having terrorist ties without jeopardizing their civil liberties.</p>
        <p>Government officials said their investigations could reveal evidence of terrorist ties that fell short of a ''smoking gun'' that could be used to prosecute such charities on charges of violating a 1996 law banning fund-raising by and contributions to groups that sponsor or support international terrorism.</p>
        <p>According to government documents and interviews with officials, the government has been investigating the Holy Land Foundation since 1996. But no charges have been filed against the charity.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, we can't deny a group registration or funding to a group simply because it is being investigated,'' said a State Department official.</p>
        <p>''But in this case, we concluded that Holy Land's support for the widows and orphans of suicide bombers was inimical to the American-led peace process in the Middle East, and hence, to American national security and foreign policy objectives,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, a State Department official said the administration did not want to jeopardize the work of more than 6,000 legitimate Islamic groups operating worldwide, which provide emergency relief in dangerous and desperate places, often with the support of friendly states. Nor, he added, does it want to be publicly criticized as being anti-Muslim.</p>
