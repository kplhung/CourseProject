        <p>Mitsubishi Motors has had perhaps its worst week in its history. On Tuesday, the company acknowledged that it had concealed customer complaints for more than two decades, and in a scene that was televised nationally, its president profusely apologized to the transportation minister. Its stock has dropped more than 6 percent this week.</p>
        <p>Despite the public humiliation, Mitsubishi, Japan's fourth-largest car manufacturer, is not likely to suffer a significant loss in sales or damage to its brand image in Japan, analysts here say.</p>
        <p>''The direct impact from the recall is negligible,'' said Koji Endo, an automobile analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>For one, analysts said, both Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru, and Daihatu Motors were forced to recall cars in the late 1990's, with little subsequent impact on sales.</p>
        <p>''Japanese consumers' attention tends to go to new car models,'' said Seiji Sugiura, an analyst with Nomura Securities in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>And despite the admitted deception, ''in Mitsubishi's case, there were injuries involving one vehicle out of 600,000 to 700,000 recalled,'' Mr. Sugiura said, further limiting potential public reaction to the recall of 620,000 cars and trucks.</p>
        <p>There is also the matter of Mitsubishi's powerful name. The Mitsubishi cluster of companies, or keirestsu -- which includes Mitsubishi Heavy Industries -- has a work force that numbers in the hundreds of thousands, and many of those workers can be expected to be loyal customers.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Mitsubishi, which makes such models as the Montero sport utility vehicle, Galant sedan and Mirage compact, has already been suffering from weak sales both in Japan and abroad. Mitsubishi Motors' domestic car sales fell by more than 3 percent for the six months ended in June, while Honda Motor's sales rose 9.7 percent, and Toyota Motor's gained 5.3 percent.</p>
        <p>Mitsubishi Motors is also plagued by a huge debt load. To survive, the company has sought an alliance with DaimlerChrysler, which has agreed to take a 34 percent stake.</p>
        <p>Mitsubishi has estimated that costs associated with the recall, which involves replacement parts and repair work, will be about 7.5 billion yen -- or about $70.2 million based on current exchange rates -- an amount that is not expected to significantly add to the company's projected net loss of 70 billion yen, or $655 million, for the fiscal year ending March 2001.</p>
        <p>The loss is largely a result of insufficient funds for liabilities stemming from pension and retirement payments.</p>
        <p>Although the cost of the recall  could ultimately swell to nearly 10 billion yen, ''that could be offset by selling plants, stocks or land,'' Mr. Endo of First Boston said.</p>
        <p>The company also faces a possible criminal prosecution for failing to report defects to the government. The Tokyo police said today that they were considering an investigation. But the maximum penalty under Japanese law is a fine of 4 million yen, or $37,500. The true punishment is ''the social sanction for getting penalized,'' said Yukikazu Komiyama, an official with the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
        <p>But pride in the Mitsubishi name may offset any such sanction.  ''People who work for Mitsubishi group companies will shore up sales of Mitsubishi cars,'' Mr. Endo of First Boston said. ''There might even be a campaign to buy a Mitsubishi.''</p>
