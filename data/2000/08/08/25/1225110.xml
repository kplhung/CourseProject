        <p>PARAGUAY: OPPOSITION VICTORY  After a tense 12-day delay in counting the vote, a narrow victory was won by Julio Cesar Franco, left, the opposition Liberal Party candidate to replace the vice president assassinated last year. The defeat of Felix Argana, son of the slain official, is the first at the national level for the governing Colorado Party since it came to power in 1947, and is expected to weaken the position of the unpopular president, Luis Gonzalez Macchi, who was appointed in the chaos that followed the slaying.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: ARGENTINE HELD  An Argentine accused by a Mexican paper of being a fugitive ''dirty war'' torturer wanted by a Spanish judge was detained by the police for an identity check, officials said. Ricardo Miguel Cavallo was arrested in Cancun when his flight to Buenos Aires stopped to refuel, said Miguel Ponce Edmonson, head of the Mexican branch of Interpol.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: OPPOSITION TO RUN  Serbia's largest opposition party decided to run in the Sept. 24 parliamentary elections, dropping a boycott threat. But the Serbian Renewal Movement, led by Vuk Draskovic, said it would contest the vote for both houses of the assembly independently, dealing a blow to Western hopes the opposition would unite against President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: 204 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SEIZED  Civil Guards on land and at sea detained 204 people who were trying to enter Spain illegally by crossing the Strait of Gibraltar. Those detained included 65 men and women rounded up after they landed and a smaller group of people rescued after their boat sank.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: EXPLOSIONS TIED TO BASQUE REBELS  Five bomb blasts damaged two businesses and three trucks in the Basque cities of San Sebastian and Irun as violence linked to a separatist campaign by the group E.T.A. continued. There were no injuries in the explosions, which authorities said were part of efforts by E.T.A. and its supporters to intimidate businesses in Spain's northern Basque region.</p>

        <p>AZERBAIJAN: PRESS STRIKE  Fifteen opposition and independent newspapers will begin a three-day strike today to protest the arrest of a leading opposition editor. They will be joined by eight news agencies and journalist groups.</p>

        <p>BANGLADESH: EX-CHIEF LOSES APPEAL  The High Court has upheld the corruption conviction of former President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, now a leading opposition figure. It reduced his sentence, however, from seven years to five while also fining him about $1 million. Mr. Ershad, who had been free on bail since 1997, is expected to appeal.</p>

        <p>JAPAN, NORTH KOREA: TALKS FAIL  Japanese and North Korean negotiators failed to resolve differences on a final day of talks in Tokyo, but they agreed to meet again in October. The talks stumbled over issues like North Korea's call for an apology for Japan's 1910-45 rule of the Korean peninsula, and the issue of Japanese who  Tokyo believes were abducted by Pyongyang. The next round will be held in a third country to be decided later, Japan's Foreign Ministry said.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: PRESS CALLED RACIST  In a long-awaited report on bias in the country's press, the South African Human Rights Commission called the media racist and criticized news organizations for not doing enough to identify and eliminate racist views and practices. The 97-page report urged news organizations to come up with more effective ways of monitoring themselves, stopping short of proposing any new layer of government regulation.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: POLICE REBUFFED  After the police took the unusual step of destroying the dwellings of squatters occupying farms outside the capital, senior government officials disavowed the action, saying it contradicted policy. The move against the squatters, who have occupied hundreds of farms for several months, had raised the hopes of South Africa, which has been pressing Zimbabwe's leaders to end the crisis.</p>

        <p>CONGO: KABILA SWITCH  President Laurent Kabila, who has had an up-and-down relationship with the United Nations, now says peacekeeping troops can be based almost anywhere in the country and will be permitted to move around freely. His decision follows a visit by Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar of Nigeria, an envoy of Secretary General Kofi Annan, who has warned that an uncooperative attitude might abort the peace mission, which has yet to deploy.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAN: PRESIDENT MEETS JEWS  President Mohammad Khatami met in Tehran with 40 members of the Jewish minority  ahead of an appeals court ruling expected early next month on 10 Iranian Jews convicted of spying for Israel. ''I feel responsible before all Iranian people, whether they are Muslims, Jews, Zoroastrians or Christians,'' Mr. Khatami said, adding that the religion of the men in the case was not an issue. ''We hope the court will rule justly and according to the law.''</p>

        <p>LEBANON: VOTE SET  Voting for a new Parliament begins Sunday in an election already marred by violence and charges that the outcome has been rigged by the pro-Syrian government. About 1.3 million voters in the north and Mount Lebanon, the Christian heartland, will kick off the election, the third since the 1975-90 civil war. Beirut, the Bekaa region and the south will vote the following Sunday.</p>
