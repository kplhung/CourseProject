        <p>Hearings are set for Monday in the copyright infringement trial of Seagram's Universal Music Group against MP3.com, after a ruling on Wednesday by a federal judge that could limit the damages owed by the Internet music start-up. Federal District Judge Jed S. Rakoff ruled that damages would be assessed for copyright violations of each compact disc, not for every individual song that was infringed by Mp3.com, as the recording industry had wanted. Universal and four other major record labels sued MP3.com in January, saying it had made illegal digital copies of songs available on its site. In April, Judge Rakoff ruled against MP3.com, saying it had infringed record company copyrights. MP3.com has settled with four of the record companies.</p>
