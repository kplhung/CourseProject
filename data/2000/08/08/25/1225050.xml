        <p>Brooklyn residents tend to be fierce defenders of their home turf. It's a tradition that goes back a long way -- as far back, in fact, as the Revolutionary War.</p>
        <p>The Lefferts Homestead Children's Historic House Museum will honor that spirit this weekend with a commemoration of the Aug. 27, 1776 Battle of Long Island (also known as the Battle of Brooklyn).</p>
        <p>''The battle is extremely significant to the homestead,'' said Vivienne Shaffer, the museum's director. ''Without it, it would have been a different house.''</p>
        <p>The original house and the one belonging to the next-door neighbors, the Hegemans, were burned down by the Americans because the British were hiding behind them. (The families had already fled.)</p>
        <p>At an illustration workshop tomorrow, children will hear the story of the attack in ''The Social History of Flatbush,'' by Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt. Her 1920's account is told from the point of view of her grandmother Femmetie Hegeman Lefferts, a young girl during the war.</p>
        <p>Children will be given copies of the story with spaces for their own colorful illustrations. They will also receive maps of 18th-century Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Tammy Hall, a storyteller, will give her own dramatic rendition of the tale. Later, she and Hasan Bakr will switch from nonfiction to fiction with their final performance in the ''Folk Tales From Around the World'' series, accompanied by African instruments.</p>
        <p>Battle of Long Island drop-in illustration workshop, tomorrow from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m., and battle storytelling, on Sunday at 1 p.m., at the Lefferts Homestead, Prospect Park, Flatbush Avenue near Empire Boulevard, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, (718) 965-6505. Free.</p>
        <p>Fringe Fantasies</p>
        <p>Experimental theater couldn't continue to thrive without a new generation of enthusiasts. That's why the Fringe Festival always offers Fringe Jr., performances for the young drama lover who prefers his Mother Goose on the saucy side.</p>
        <p>This year, alas, there are only two junior productions. The first, ''Bubulinos' Archetypes,'' seems geared to future supporters of the Green Party. An anticapitalist fable, it draws on the myth of Pandora's box, as well as on ''The Wizard of Oz,'' Internet terminology and space travel.</p>
        <p>The writer and director, Roi Escudero, known as Bubi, plays several characters, including Robotica Humanoid. Robotica is protected by the Bubulinos, spirits portrayed by a group of adorable children. The Bubulinos have to help Robotica evade Mrs. Mind, a villainess with a mysterious suitcase that holds many of the world's evils, like ''the Barbie Dollar Overcoat of Ambition.''</p>
        <p>Children over 5 may be fascinated by Bubi's wild masks and gear. Younger ones will probably be frightened, especially when she wears a devil's costume and traps the Bubulinos in a web of plastic six-pack holders. Still, the 75-minute play ends happily, if not coherently.</p>
        <p>''When the World Was Young'' is more straightforward: 45 minutes of storytelling by Tinamarie Panyard. With neither props nor a set, she inventively plays all the characters, from leprechauns to a river monster.</p>
        <p>Best of all, her stories -- a Celtic folk tale, a Liberian fable and a Native American legend -- are unfamiliar, even to seasoned listeners. The last, which explains the evolution of frogs, is especially charming.</p>
        <p>The festival has also returned with Fort Fringe Jr., this time held in the La Plaza Cultural Garden at Ninth Street and Avenue C. Here children can make masks, have their faces painted and invent and act out stories, just like grown-up Fringers.</p>
        <p>''Bubulinos' Archetypes,'' today at 3:30 and 7 p.m. at the Experimental Theater, the Henry Street Settlement Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side. ''When the World Was Young,'' today and tomorrow at 5 p.m. and Sunday at noon at Charas/El Bohio, Teatro 309, 605 East Ninth Street, East Village. Tickets: $12; the elderly, children and residents of ZIP code 10002, $7. Reservations: (212) 420-8877. Fort Fringe Jr., tomorrow from noon to 2 p.m. Free.</p>
        <p>Cutting Commentary</p>
        <p>You might think ''Dance of the Scissors'' would be a modern creation, an arty gem by someone like Martha Graham or Twyla Tharp. It even includes headstands and moves hip-hop dancers would appreciate. Yet the dance, despite its use of a contemporary household implement, is an ancient one belonging to the Quechuan Indians of the Andes.</p>
        <p>Maximo Damian, a Quechuan master violinist from Peru, will lead his Damian Musical Group in the dance this weekend at the National Museum of the American Indian.  ''It's a very acrobatic dance of competition between two dancers,'' said Shawn Termin, the museum's program specialist. ''One will end up holding the harp player on his shoulders and dancing with him. The key thing is to keep the scissors moving.''</p>
        <p>Like the violin, the scissors the dancers hold are post-colonial elements. ''In some places, they say the dance was started when the dominant culture took over,'' Ms. Termin said. But while some have argued that the dance is a rebuke to the Spanish conquerors, others note that it is also associated with the harvest, with healing and with local spirits.</p>
        <p>It has remained a mystery for centuries, Ms. Termin said.</p>
        <p>''Dance of the Scissors,'' tomorrow and Sunday at 1 and 3:30 p.m. in the auditorium of the Heye Center, the National Museum of the American Indian, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3894. Free.</p>
