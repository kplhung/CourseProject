        <p>State transportation officials said today that New Jersey Transit riders would not face a fare increase this fiscal year, despite earlier concerns that the agency might be short of money.</p>
        <p>James Weinstein, New Jersey's transportation commissioner, said, ''It is very unlikely that there will be a fare increase in the foreseeable future'' for the agency, whose buses and trains carry more than 321,000 passengers daily. He made the comments as officials were putting the finishing touches on New Jersey Transit's approximately $1 billion operating budget for the current fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Concerns about a fare increase surfaced in the last month when legislative changes in the sources of financing and in how the state could use the transportation trust fund for operating expenses appeared to leave the agency about $39 million short of what it needed.</p>
        <p>Today a spokesman for Mr. Warsh, Penny Bassett Hackett, echoed Mr. Weinstein, saying that no fare increase was planned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weinstein said that he and other officials were in the midst of reallocating money from a number of sources -- the federal government, the state's transportation trust fund and its general fund -- to meet the agency's needs and to comply with the changes approved during the last session of the Legislature. One of those changes, he said, increased to five years from two the life span of some equipment that can be bought with the trust fund.</p>
        <p>The commissioner said that the change had, among other things, caused the agency to drop its plans for using trust fund money for new tires for its fleet of 1,900 buses, since their life span was likely to fall short of the new limits.</p>
        <p>''There are things that we would have spent trust fund money on which we can't now,'' Mr. Weinstein said. ''So we just have to do some reallocation.''</p>
        <p>Commuter groups had worried about a fare increase in recent weeks that would have ended 10 straight years without one.</p>
        <p>Pete McDonough, a spokesman for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, reiterated the governor's strong opposition to any increase. He said that there would have to be ''extraordinary documentation'' supporting one as well as internal spending cuts before she would even consider backing an increase.</p>
