        <p>The article about human-powered generators and other devices did not mention the ecological benefits such products could have by replacing our reliance on batteries with a device that could reduce our fat cells while we watched our portable DVD players. A brilliant designer and engineer named Victor Papanek, who died a few years ago, designed a clockwork (windup) radio for developing countries. He spent the last part of his career developing a clockwork computer.</p>
