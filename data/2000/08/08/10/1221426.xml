        <p>Jerome Smith, the original guitarist for the disco party kings K. C. and the Sunshine Band, died on Friday after a construction accident, The Associated Press reported. He was 47 and lived in Miami.</p>
        <p>His body was crushed in the accident, which took place at the construction site where he worked in West Palm Beach, the news agency said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith's suave sound became familiar to disco fans before he joined K. C. and the Sunshine Band, when he played the signature riff on George McRae's ''Rock Your Baby.'' He was soon invited by the production team of Harry Wayne Casey (also known as K. C.) and Richard Finch to join the Sunshine Band.</p>
        <p>His guitar, altered in the studio to sound like a synthesizer, provided the hook for ''Get Down Tonight,'' the band's breakthrough hit. Before he left the group in 1979, it had five No. 1 songs, including ''That's the Way (I Like It),'' ''(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty'' and ''I'm Your Boogie Man.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith had other musical successes, playing on 10 albums by the disco burlesque artist Blowfly and touring in America with the Australian group the Divinyls.</p>
        <p>In the 1990's he contributed to the soundrack of the television show ''Melrose Place.'' He was reportedly hoping to rejoin K. C. and the Sunshine Band at the time of his death.</p>
