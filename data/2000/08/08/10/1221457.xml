        <p>The National Rifle Association said today that it planned to run newspaper and television advertisements during the Democratic National Convention next week attacking the party for wanting ''to destroy the Second Amendment,'' in what the association's leaders called an effort to divide the Democrats' conservative and liberal wings over gun control.</p>
        <p>In the television spot, which is expected to begin running on cable television news shows this weekend, the actor Charlton Heston, who is also president of the rifle association, looks into the camera and calls the Clinton administration ''the most antigun White House in history.''</p>

        <p>The National Rifle Association said today that it planned to run newspaper and television advertisements during the Democratic National Convention next week attacking the party for wanting ''to destroy the Second Amendment,'' in what the association's leaders called an effort to divide the Democrats' conservative and liberal wings over gun control.</p>
        <p>In the television spot, which is expected to begin running on cable television news shows this weekend, the actor Charlton Heston, who is also president of the rifle association, looks into the camera and calls the Clinton administration ''the most antigun White House in history.''</p>
        <p>''From antigun mayors and marchers to gun-hating celebrities and politicians, they're almost all Democrats,'' Mr. Heston says. ''Tell me: Why are so few Democrats willing to defend constitutional freedom?''</p>
        <p>The N.R.A. has made no secret of its antipathy toward Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, vowing to throw its resources into defeating Mr. Gore this fall. The group, which has pledged to spend more than $15 million helping state and federal candidates this year, has yet to endorse Mr. Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush. But its leaders have made clear that they think Mr. Bush's record on gun issues in Texas is to their liking.</p>
        <p>Yet despite the group's close ties to the Republican Party, it has never before taken such a broad swipe at the Democratic Party, rifle association leaders said today. Indeed, the group maintains good relations with about 50 Democratic members of Congress, and is spending nearly $50,000 on a reception at the convention honoring the Democrats' conservative Blue Dog Coalition.</p>
        <p>But Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A. executive vice president, said today that the association would be using its advertising to hammer home the assertion that the national Democratic Party had lost touch with its more rural, conservative wing.</p>
        <p>And Mr. LaPierre asserted that Mr. Gore's support for strong gun laws would hurt him in several  swing states that have many hunters and gun owners.</p>
        <p>''For the first time, you're seeing a major wedge issue splitting the national party with its base in places like Michigan, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Missouri and Arkansas,'' Mr. LaPierre said. ''My guess is that their polls show they are getting skewered in all those states.''</p>
        <p>Though he declined to give details on the cost of the advertisements, Mr. LaPierre said the group was spending nearly $1 million for the television commercials, which will also run on network morning shows, and advertisements in U.S.A. Today and The Los Angeles Times.</p>
        <p>Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said, ''The ad is misleading because we support Second Amendment rights and want to protect those rights for law-abiding gun owners and sportsmen, while promoting common-sense policies to keep guns away from kids and criminals.''</p>
