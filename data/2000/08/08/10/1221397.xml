        <p>Just as the stores are stuffed with all the new fashions for fall, the fresh hot gadgets are beginning to roll out into the marketplace as well. Earlier this week, Palm Inc. announced its new product lineup, which includes a low-priced entry-level version of the Palm organizer, a RAM infusion for the company's wireless model and two new limited editions of the Palm Vx.</p>
        <p>Palm's new low-end organizer, the m100, has new applications and a simple cable for synchronizing the device to a desktop computer -- all for about $149, which would be the lowest price for a Palm to date. The new Palm has all the standard applications for things like addresses and a calendar plus an electronic notepad that lets people use their own handwriting to jot down phone numbers and reminders. A new clock application, which displays the time through a small window in the m100's fliptop case, can be activated with the press of a button on the front of the unit.</p>

        <p>Just as the stores are stuffed with all the new fashions for fall, the fresh hot gadgets are beginning to roll out into the marketplace as well. Earlier this week, Palm Inc. announced its new product lineup, which includes a low-priced entry-level version of the Palm organizer, a RAM infusion for the company's wireless model and two new limited editions of the Palm Vx.</p>
        <p>Palm's new low-end organizer, the m100, has new applications and a simple cable for synchronizing the device to a desktop computer -- all for about $149, which would be the lowest price for a Palm to date. The new Palm has all the standard applications for things like addresses and a calendar plus an electronic notepad that lets people use their own handwriting to jot down phone numbers and reminders. A new clock application, which displays the time through a small window in the m100's fliptop case, can be activated with the press of a button on the front of the unit.</p>
        <p>The m100, with two megabytes of RAM, is aimed more at home users than at business executives or professionals with more demanding needs for personal digital assistants. Following the lead of Nokia, which makes available colorful covers for cell phones, Palm is offering snap-on faceplates in different colors for the m100. Each plate costs around $20.</p>
        <p>The company's Palm VII device, which has attracted a great number of handheld users seeking instant and integrated wireless access, is getting just what its critics said it needed: more memory. The new Palm VIIx, priced at $449, will now be packing eight megabytes of RAM (up from two megabytes) and twice as many Web clipping applications as were offered by the original wireless effort. Users will get 40 of the streamlined-for-the-handheld Web programs, like CBS MarketWatch.com and Travelocity.com, right out of the box, and more than 400 applications are available for downloading from the www.palm.net site.</p>
        <p>And it wouldn't be fall without some color, so  fans of the company's popular Palm Vx unit can now choose between a ''millennium blue'' and a goldish ''champagne'' aluminum casing. The limited-edition devices are available for $399 each at the company's site.</p>
