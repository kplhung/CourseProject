        <p>Vice President Al Gore has for months been planning the Democratic National Convention as a coming-out party for his presidential campaign and a long-awaited opportunity to step out of President Clinton's imposing shadow.</p>
        <p>But Bill and Hillary Clinton each intend to spend twice as much time in Los Angeles as the vice president, basking in the spotlight and raising millions of dollars for their own political projects.</p>
        <p>By the end of the Democratic convention week, the Clintons will have raised far more money than the vice president -- $4 million anticipated for the first lady's New York Senate bid at a star-studded concert this Saturday night and at least $10 million for Mr. Clinton's presidential library at a brunch that Barbra Streisand will hold this Sunday at her compound in Malibu. Each of 50 couples at the brunch has committed at least $100,000, and some more than $1 million, to the president's library in Little Rock, Ark.</p>
        <p>Ms. Streisand will also lend her cachet to Mr. Gore's campaign, headlining a concert at the Shrine Auditorium next Thursday that is expected to raise at least $2.5 million for the Democratic National Committee. Ms. Streisand will sing three songs.</p>
        <p>Some Gore aides and senior Democratic fund-raisers are angry about the Clinton-heavy convention schedule, saying they are concerned the Clinton events will siphon off Hollywood money that would be better spent assisting the Gore-Lieberman ticket.</p>
        <p>The stacked social calendar has also rankled some wealthy Southern California Democrats, who say they have been bombarded by invitations to fund-raisers and appeals for money. Finally, the political ailment known as ''donor fatigue'' may have hit Hollywood.</p>
        <p>''This is Gore's convention, but there are two tributes to Clinton,'' said a Democratic strategist who insisted on anonymity. ''It's embarrassing for the Gores to have this huge event for the president that will raise money for Hillary. This convention is not about her.''</p>
        <p>How can it be that three people who work in the same complex and whose careers have been intimately entwined for the past eight years seem unable to coordinate what should be one of the most important events of the Clinton era?</p>
        <p>But, in fact, not only is there little coordination between the Gore presidential campaign and Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign, but there is also competition between Mr. Gore and Mrs. Clinton for money and attention, most dramatically at the coming Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>And for his part, the president is trying to balance the needs of both candidates, while burnishing his legacy and raising tens of millions of dollars for his presidential library.</p>
        <p>The highly visible events spotlighting President Clinton and his wife in Los Angeles are not only troubling to the Gore forces because they drain money. They also put the Clintons at center stage just as the vice president and his ticket-mate are trying to occupy that territory and distance themselves from Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Even one adviser to Mrs. Clinton said today that it might have been inappropriate for the first lady to use Mr. Gore's nominating convention as a venue to raise money for her Senate campaign.</p>
        <p>Several Gore allies said today that they were not worried about the money, but they acknowledged that the symbolism would be unmistakable: on the eve of Mr. Gore's national moment, all of Hollywood will turn out to honor Mr. Clinton, not once but twice.</p>
        <p>Convention organizers had already faced a delicate balancing act in deciding a role for the Clintons. It was partly addressed when the president and first lady agreed to address the delegates at the Staples Center on the convention's opening night. Afterward, the president will be saluted by the Democratic Party's top donors at Paramount Studios; the Clintons will then leave Los Angeles on Tuesday morning.</p>
        <p>But the competition over fund-raising demonstrates that the competition between the two camps is not fully resolved.</p>
        <p>The headline event is Saturday night at a private Los Angeles estate. More than 1,400 people will attend a salute to the president, with the proceeds going to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign. Among the performers will be Paul Anka, Michael Bolton, Toni Braxton, Cher, Melissa Etheridge, Patti LaBelle, Brian McKnight, Diana Ross, Mark McGrath of Sugar Ray, Stevie Wonder and Luther Vandross. And there will be tributes on stage by Ted Danson, Michael Douglas, Whoopi Goldberg, Goldie Hawn, Angelica Huston, Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Dylan McDermott, Rosa Parks, Gregory Peck, Jimmy Smits, Mary Steenburgen, John Travolta and Red Buttons.</p>
        <p>The host of the Saturday night concert is Stan Lee, the comic book publishing icon and creator of Spider-Man. Aaron Tonken, a consultant for Stan Lee Media who recruited the talent, played down the talk in Los Angeles that the concert would overshadow Mr. Gore's own concert on Thursday night. But he also acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton was sensitive about the event.</p>
        <p>''Mrs. Clinton's campaign office pushed very hard for me to help get as much talent as possible for the vice president's event,'' Mr. Tonken said. ''She has been very sensitive and almost pushy for me to help the vice president.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's event on Thursday night at the 6,000-seat Shrine Auditorium features a concert by Ms. Streisand, as well as appearances by Whoopi Goldberg, Baby Face, Boyz II Men and Gladys Knight. Tickets range from $150 to $20,000. A few $1,000 tickets are still unsold.</p>
        <p>The Saturday night tribute to the president also caused some concern among members of the host committee, who scheduled the media party for the same night.</p>
        <p>Garry South, a top political adviser to Gov. Gray Davis of California, acknowledged that there had been competing demands for entertainers to draw donors to Democratic fund-raisers. ''Some competition for talent is inevitable,'' he said. ''There's been some jostling here about the whole thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. South said that aides to Mrs. Clinton called him several weeks ago to propose a major soft-money fund-raiser on Saturday night with top entertainment figures. He said he did not advise against it -- in fact, Governor Davis is a co-sponsor of the event -- but warned the Clinton campaign that she would be competing with numerous other fund-raising events during convention week.</p>
        <p>''From a practical standpoint, I told them they'd have to do it in a way that doesn't distract from other activities, including the salute to President Clinton on Monday and the concert for Gore and the D.N.C. Thursday night,'' Mr. South said.</p>
        <p>''We get this in California all the time,'' Mr. South said. ''There are a zillion people coming out here all year long in ongoing and nonstop fund-raising activities.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''All three events will come off smashingly and everybody will be happy as a clam and everybody will make a lot of clams.''</p>
        <p>A supporter of the Clintons complained that the Saturday night concert benefiting Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign had ''spun out of control,'' saying the organizers ''don't care about Hillary and the president -- they are promoting themselves, and politically, this just hurts Hillary.''</p>
        <p>But a senior Gore adviser played down concerns about Mrs. Clinton's fund-raiser, saying: ''We welcome the event for Hillary. If any of our fund-raisers think we are being hurt by her events, they are just wrong. The phones are ringing off the hook. We are doing great.'' The adviser, who refused to be identified, acknowledged that there had been ''grumbling'' among fund-raisers, but added that fund-raisers often complained about the hard task of raising money.</p>
        <p>And Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, also said his candidate was not draining resources from Mr. Gore. ''Thanks to the very strong economy created under the Clinton-Gore administration, there is more than enough to go around,'' Mr. Wolfson said.</p>
        <p>One generous Democratic contributor in the entertainment business turned down an invitation to the Sunday brunch at Ms. Streisand's home. He described the event to an aide as ''a heavy ticket'' requiring a donation of $100,000 to $1 million in a year when demand for political money was already intense.</p>
        <p>He told the aide he might consider contributing to the library project next year or later, but felt he had done more than enough for the party this year.</p>
        <p>After leaving Los Angeles on Tuesday morning, the president will travel to Michigan for an appearance with the vice president at a symbolic passing of the torch. Mr. Gore will then depart for Los Angeles.</p>
