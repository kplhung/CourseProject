        <p>Brazil's economy grew 3.92 percent in the second quarter compared with the period a year earlier, the government said today in a report that suggested that the country's recovery from its devastating currency crisis in early 1999 was accelerating.</p>

        <p>Brazil's economy grew 3.92 percent in the second quarter compared with the period a year earlier, the government said today in a report that suggested that the country's recovery from its devastating currency crisis in early 1999 was accelerating.</p>
        <p>The report by the National Statistics Institute was stronger than many forecasters had expected. It led some to project that growth rates for the second half of the year and for 2001 would also be stronger than forecast as the country benefits from a series of interest rate reductions made by the central bank this spring to stimulate borrowing and spending.</p>
        <p>''This shows that we are having a really solid recovery,'' said Gustavo Loyola, a consultant at Tendencias Consultoria and a former president of the central bank. ''Investor and consumer confidence is growing. Barring any imported crises, we can expect even better growth for next year.'</p>
        <p>In the first six months of the year, Brazil's gross domestic product grew 3.84 percent compared with the period in 1999, when a devaluation of the currency, the real, in January sent shock waves throughout the economy and reduced that year's growth to little more than 1 percent. Analysts say that the six-month results now make the government's growth target of 4 percent this year achievable. For next year, economists expect growth of around 4.5 percent to 5 percent.</p>
        <p>Agricultural production was a major contributor to second-quarter growth as crops of coffee, soybeans and other Brazilian staples grew by 10.75 percent, more than expected. Brazil's industrial production growth rate of 4.34 percent in the quarter was also considered a strong sign of steady expansion.</p>
        <p>''Agricultural production is a volatile figure that can vary greatly from year to year,'' said Andre Carvalho, chief economist at the Federation of Industry of the State of Sao Paulo. ''Industrial growth usually builds on itself every quarter.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carvalho said that companies were taking advantage of recent cuts in interest rates to finance expansion, which will add favorably to growth figures over the next year. At the same time, the central bank's recent reduction of compulsory reserve requirements has allowed banks to offer more credit to both industry and consumers.</p>
        <p>So far, consumers have been shy about spending more aggressively, but cheaper credit and a gradual fall in the unemployment rate are expected to attract shoppers to stores in the second half of the year.</p>
        <p>The strong growth figures come at a propitious time for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, whose administration has recently been accused of involvement in an embezzlement scandal involving more than $100 million.</p>
        <p>Despite a continuing Senate investigation into the affair, Mr. Cardoso's approval rating increased to 19 percent in July from 13 percent the month before, according to the pollsters Vox Populi.</p>
