        <p>John Wiley &amp; Sons, a leading publisher of scientific, medical and technical books based in Manhattan, has signed a lease for office space in Hoboken, N.J., where it plans to move its headquarters and 800 of its employees.</p>
        <p>Wiley, whose headquarters have been at 605 Third Avenue, at 39th Street, since 1962, is to occupy eight floors of a 13-story office structure for which ground is to be broken next month, said Tony Cicatiello, a spokesman for SJP Properties, the developer. The building is one of two that SJP is constructing for a development called the Waterfront Corporate Center, part of a city plan to redevelop the Hoboken waterfront with office buildings, a hotel and housing.</p>

        <p>John Wiley &amp; Sons, a leading publisher of scientific, medical and technical books based in Manhattan, has signed a lease for office space in Hoboken, N.J., where it plans to move its headquarters and 800 of its employees.</p>
        <p>Wiley, whose headquarters have been at 605 Third Avenue, at 39th Street, since 1962, is to occupy eight floors of a 13-story office structure for which ground is to be broken next month, said Tony Cicatiello, a spokesman for SJP Properties, the developer. The building is one of two that SJP is constructing for a development called the Waterfront Corporate Center, part of a city plan to redevelop the Hoboken waterfront with office buildings, a hotel and housing.</p>
        <p>The building Wiley is to occupy is expected to be completed in early 2002. Wiley's lease is for 400,000 square feet and has a 15-year term. A spokesman for the publishing house, Susan Spilka, declined to say what the rent would be.</p>
        <p>With its business expanding, Wiley was seeking larger space, but was unable to find an affordable site in Manhattan, real estate specialists said. As part of an incentive package, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority approved a business employment incentive grant for Wiley that is expected to provide $7 million over the next 10 years. Ms. Spilka declined to say whether Wiley had asked the New York City government for economic benefits to remain in the city.</p>
        <p>Among other major companies that have recently found office space across the Hudson is Chase Manhattan Bank, which said in June that it would move several thousand employees from Lower Manhattan to Jersey City but would retain its headquarters at 270 Park Avenue in Manhattan.</p>
