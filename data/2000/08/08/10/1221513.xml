        <p>Microsoft said yesterday that Robert Muglia, a longtime executive, would head its new .Net Internet strategy. In June, Microsoft shifted its focus from desktop software to services offered on the Internet. Mr. Muglia will be group vice president of the .NET Services Group, which will develop the software and services that will make up the new .Net business. Also yesterday, Microsoft said that David Cole would lead the personal services platform division, which will provide network services for the new business; Brian MacDonald would develop premium services for the .Net effort; and Kai Fu Lee, now at Microsoft's research laboratory in Beijing, would head a new user interface technologies division.</p>
