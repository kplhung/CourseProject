        <p>The Museum of Television and Radio in New York has begun a project to interview people from television and radio about their work. Several of the videotaped interviews are on the museum's Web site (www.mtr.org/perspectives). Some highlights: Mary Tyler Moore, left, talks about her audition for Carl Reiner and Danny Thomas for ''The Dick Van Dyke Show.'' John Frankenheimer, the director, talks about Edward R. Murrow's radio broadcasts during World War II. And Dan Rather, the CBS News anchor, speaks about the assassination of President Kennedy and the Vietnam War.</p>
