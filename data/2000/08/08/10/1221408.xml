      <abstract>
        <p>Independent Power Producers of New York executive director Carol E Murphy letter on Aug 3 article disputes Consolidate Edison chairman Eugene R McGrath's stand that independent power producers are to blame for rising electricity bills; blames jump in fuel costs and shortage of downstate generating capacity</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As the group that collectively produces two-thirds of New York State's electrical power, we take exception to accusations made by Consolidated Edison's chairman, Eugene R. McGrath, that independent power producers are to blame for Con Ed's rising electricity bills to customers (news article, Aug. 3).</p>
        <p>The real reason for higher electricity prices this summer is twofold: Fuel costs have increased by as much as 80 percent since last year, and there is a shortage of downstate generating capacity. Independent power producers have virtually no control over rising fuel costs.</p>

        <p>If New York City residents want lower electricity prices in the short term, they should push to have Con Ed return some of the $1.8 billion it has made from the sale of its plants. For the long term, they must support the siting of new generating plants to serve the growing electricity demand.</p>
