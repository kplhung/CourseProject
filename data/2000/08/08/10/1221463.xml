        <p>The Nassau County executive and other officials turned a blind eye while connected Republican businessmen concocted a health insurance deal that cost the county $40 million, an independent investigator said in a report released today.</p>
        <p>The county, in 1997, hired a Suffolk County company, Benefit Plan Administrators, to manage its new system of self-insurance. The plan was to save money by having the county pay its own health care costs for 26,000 employees and retirees. Benefit Plan Administrators guaranteed savings of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>The reality was cost overruns, fiscal disarray and questions about consulting fees and commissions paid in connection with the deal. In the report released today, the investigator,  former State Supreme Court Justice Milton Mollen, excoriated County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta for his ''penchant for government by committee.''</p>
        <p>''Principal participants in the decision-making process either shirked their governmental responsibilities or manipulated the decision-making process in such a manner as to ultimately cause serious financial losses to Nassau County,'' wrote Mr. Mollen, who headed the investigation of  corruption in the New York City Police Department from 1992-94.</p>
        <p>The details of the health insurance contract surfaced in early 1998 just as it was becoming clear how far Nassau County's finances had deteriorated. From then on, its financial woes became the stuff of front page headlines and ultimately led to a $100 million state bailout package, a fiscal oversight board and a downgrading of county bonds to a level just above junk.</p>
        <p>''I am the chief executive and whatever good or bad happens in this county, the buck stops with me,'' Mr. Gulotta said of the report's findings in a telephone interview today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta called later to add: ''But in context, I relied upon my chief deputy and upon other officers in government on the contract. I have to say that this was a failure of the system.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta's deputy, Robert J. McDonald, a Republican, headed the commission that recommended the changeover in 1997. Mr. McDonald, who retired from the county government shortly after the deal was signed, received $112,500 in consulting fees from William M. Blake, Suffolk County's former Republican Party chairman, whose insurance agency underwrote the deal.</p>
        <p>Albert E. Isernio, then the chairman of Benefit Plan Administrators, testified that his company paid Mr. Blake a commission of $50,000 a month beginning in 1996. Mr. Blake's commission was eventually rolled into a $100,000-a-month consulting fee paid to a company run by Mr. Blake's son. Those payments stopped in 1998.</p>
        <p>The report found that County Comptroller Fred Parola signed the contract between the county and the company, but that there was no indication that he had ever analyzed the contract before signing it, even though it was the largest personal services contract ever entered into by the county.</p>
        <p>''That's normal,'' Mr. Parola said. ''It's not my job to read the substance of contracts. Our responsibility is to make sure it's to form and that's all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mullen found that the former county attorney, Owen Walsh, rubber-stamped the contract, which was actually written by lawyers from Benefit Plan Administrators. The company has been dropped as the county's health care provider.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mollen wrote that the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Nassau District Attorney should continue their investigations into whether anyone had engaged in criminal activity. His report made six recommendations, including the establishment of an independent oversight board for large contracts.</p>
