        <p>The tension between Steven Robinson and his supervisor in the housekeeping unit of a Queens nursing home had been building for more than a year, his family and co-workers said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson, a parolee, began mopping floors and making beds three years ago at the New York State Veterans Home in St. Albans under a prison work release program.

        <p>The tension between Steven Robinson and his supervisor in the housekeeping unit of a Queens nursing home had been building for more than a year, his family and co-workers said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson, a parolee, began mopping floors and making beds three years ago at the New York State Veterans Home in St. Albans under a prison work release program. He said that his supervisor there, Elizabeth Parker, singled him out for reprimand and threatened to ''get him sent back to jail,'' according to his father, Willie Robinson.</p>
        <p>Ms. Parker told her co-workers that Mr. Robinson was doing a poor job, and the two had been arguing for  months, the police said. This week,  Ms. Parker chastised Mr. Robinson for using a set of keys she said he was not allowed to have, and she took the keys from him.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday morning, Mr. Robinson arrived at work fuming, according to several accounts. About 1:45 p.m., he fatally shot Ms. Parker in the head with a .22-caliber pistol in her office in the basement of the nursing home, said the police, who released Mr. Robinson's photograph yesterday and were still searching for him last night. There were no witnesses.</p>
        <p>''I believe that this built up to a crescendo of some sort where he totally lost his temper,'' said Lt. Richard Bellucci, commanding officer of the 113th detective squad in Jamaica.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Bellucci said that Ms. Parker had supervised Mr. Robinson for about two years and that the two had had several disputes. He added that co-workers interviewed by the police said that Ms. Parker was well liked on the job.</p>
        <p>Ms. Parker, 58, a supervisor of housekeeping at the nursing home, was a widow who lived in Flushing. A woman who answered the telephone yesterday at the home of one of her three daughters, Lisa Parker, said Mr. Robinson was distorting and exaggerating Ms. Parker's treatment of him in his complaints about her, but the family would not comment further.</p>
        <p>After the shooting, Mr. Robinson, 40, fled on a bicycle, stopping at his father's house in South Jamaica. There, he cried, admitted to the killing and begged his family for forgiveness, said the elder Mr. Robinson, who added that he had tried to persuade his son to go to the police, but that he sped off on the bicycle and had not contacted him since.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson was living in an apartment in South Jamaica. He is  separated from his wife and has a 12-year-old daughter, his father said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson had no history of violent crime, but had been convicted twice on drug charges, the second time in 1994, while he was on parole. In July 1997, while serving four and a half to nine years for drug possession, he was granted work release and took a housekeeping job at the St. Albans nursing home. He did well there, according to Thomas P. Grant, a spokesman for the State Division of Parole, and was paroled in January 1999.</p>
        <p>Officials at the 250-bed state-run nursing home, which is on the sprawling campus of the Veterans Administration Hospital, would not comment yesterday on the shooting. A spokeswoman for the State Department of Health said the incident was under investigation and had no further details.</p>
