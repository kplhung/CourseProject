        <p>Performance on standardized tests by students attending Edison Schools, the country's largest for-profit manager of public schools, improved at a faster rate last year than in the previous four years, even as the company enrolled more poor and minority students.</p>
        <p>The gains mirror a national trend of rising test scores, but Edison's results provide the company with a rebuttal to critics who have asserted that profit-seeking school managers like Edison might be able to increase test scores initially but would be unable to sustain those trends.</p>
        <p>In a report to be released today, Edison says that in the 1999-2000 academic year, the percentage of students in 40 Edison-run schools in 14 states meeting those states' achievement standards rose to 36 percent, from 29 percent. In the previous four years, Edison students had achieved average annual gains of six percentage points on state tests, most of which measure performance against an absolute state standard.</p>
        <p>On national tests, which generally measure students' relative performance against a norm, Edison students performed at the 39th percentile, up from the 34th percentile in the previous year.</p>
        <p>While Edison's statistics provide a reliable picture of performance of those schools, it is difficult to compare those results to national achievement standards because the scores are drawn from many different tests in schools in dozens of states. Some of those tests track students from one year to the next, while others measure the performance of students in a given grade each year.</p>
        <p>Still, the steady improvements have come as Edison has enrolled growing numbers of minority and poor students, the result of a national trend of school districts seeking private management for their worst-performing schools. Last year, African-Americans accounted for 55 percent of Edison's 37,500 students, up from 46 percent the previous year, while white students dropped to 18 percent of the total from 27 percent the year before.</p>
        <p>In addition, 65 percent of Edison's students qualified last year for free or reduced-price lunches, a generally recognized poverty indicator, up from 57 percent the previous year. Nationally, about 33 percent of students qualify for the programs.</p>
        <p>Edison's performance claims are likely to be closely scrutinized in New York City, where Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy has announced a plan to turn some of the city's worst-performing schools over to private managers start in the fall of 2001. Edison intends to offer a proposal to manage several of the schools, said Christopher Whittle, Edison's founder and chief executive.</p>
