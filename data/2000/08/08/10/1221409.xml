        <p>United States Civil Rights Commission staff director Ruby G Moy letter on Joyce Purnick's Aug 3 column denies commission is sharply divided over its report on New York City police practices</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Joyce Purnick (''2 More Voices in Dissonance Over Police,'' Metro Matters column, Aug. 3) emphasizes politics over substance by characterizing the United States Commission on Civil Rights as being in ''sharp disagreement'' over its report ''Police Practices and Civil Rights in New York City,'' based on a dissenting statement submitted by two of the commission's eight members.</p>
        <p>The report focuses on police professionalism based on the sworn testimony of knowledgeable witnesses and an analysis of thousands of subpoenaed documents. The column did not acknowledge that a particular witness testified on behalf of an organization of police officers of color. Nor did it mention that the report is not critical of the office of Manhattan's district attorney.</p>
