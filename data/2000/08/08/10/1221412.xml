        <p>AT least as interesting as Al Gore's calculations in choosing a conspicuous Jew as his running mate has been the emotional response of New York Jews of every stripe and station.</p>
        <p>As Jesse Jackson so indiscreetly once observed, New York is universally considered a Jewish city, (R.I.P., Hymie), even though the number of Jews among the 7.5 million inhabitants has dwindled from 3 million to barely 1.1 million. But New York has had two Jewish mayors (two and a half if you count Fiorello La Guardia). One of the state's two senators is Jewish and he isn't the first.</p>
        <p>New York is home to neighborhoods where a non-Jew is a rarity, to Jewish organizations, schools, synagogues, cultural institutions, universities, hospitals. Jewish men and women are threaded throughout public and political life.</p>
        <p>In other words, New York is a place where being Jewish and prominent is no big deal. You wouldn't have expected the Lieberman selection to turn Jewish New York topsy-turvy in a city where being Jewish and prominent is no big deal.</p>
        <p>Think again. Overwhelmingly, Jewish New Yorkers are exultant, exuding the kind of pride we haven't seen since Israel won the Six-Day War in 1967. ''I'm personally just elated,'' said Abraham Biderman, a commissioner in the administration of Edward I. Koch, and an Orthodox Jew. ''The symbolism of this is so powerful. Wherever I go, talking to Jews of any affiliation, this sense of euphoria is difficult for many people to express.''</p>
        <p>A Jewish colleague admitted that she cried when she heard the news. Jewish men and women, interviewed by newspapers and on television, were gleeful. Anecdotally, it sure seems that the disapproving are few, the delighted many.</p>
        <p>Why such excitement in a city where Jews are ubiquitous, in a country where many consider Jews so powerful that detractors say they control the news media, Hollywood, the banks and politics?</p>
        <p>Part of the answer is that New York City is one thing, the nation is another. The reaction must reflect the Jewish history of persecution, a people's well-earned fear of disappointment and worse.</p>
        <p>But the core reason is no doubt emotional and very human. Many Jews -- and many non-Jews -- still feel as though they are on the outside looking in, however large their accomplishments.</p>
        <p>IT is no accident that many Jewish New Yorkers never gave Mr. Lieberman a chance to be Mr. Gore's running mate. Too risky, they said. Too much anti-Semitism out there.</p>
        <p>That calculation may have been as personal as it was political, a reflection of what women feel sitting at an otherwise all-male meeting, what blacks, Latinos, Asians and gays feel when they are excluded. It's a sensibility reflected in debates about affirmative action, which continues to aggravate tensions between blacks and Jews. (Mr. Lieberman's spokesman, Dan Gerstein, said yesterday that the senator was ''in sync'' with Mr. Gore's support of affirmative action, but Mr. Lieberman said in 1995 that it was ''dividing us.'')</p>
        <p>That feeling is nebulous, hard to describe because it's what isn't there. I remember going to a conference on ''Rethinking New York'' a few years ago, and watching 12 white males talk about the future of one of the most diverse cities in the world.</p>
        <p>''It's like being erased, invalidated,'' I wrote at the time. ''At its most fundamental level, exclusion is not about political correctness or quotas or ideology. It is not ultimately a political matter, but a human one.''</p>
        <p>That, I think, is why the Lieberman selection thrilled so many Jews, even in New York. It is validation. Just as the prospect of a President George W. Bush naming Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice to his cabinet would be validation for African-Americans (and legitimate, compared to that show in Philadelphia).</p>
        <p>Recognition does not come about passively. It happens through political calculation (Mr. Gore needed Mr. Lieberman's reputation for moral rectitude) and through policies like affirmative action; an imperfect tool, but one at least aimed at inclusion.</p>
        <p>The Gore ticket raises all sorts of political questions, from whether it will help Hillary Rodham Clinton (probably not; coattails rarely do), to whether Mr. Lieberman's nomination will mean much to Mr. Gore in the long run (how many people vote for vice presidents?).</p>
        <p>Even more interesting: will those so offended by affirmative action recognize that in a way, the selection of Mr. Lieberman was a prime example of same? Worth pondering when the euphoria breaks.</p>
