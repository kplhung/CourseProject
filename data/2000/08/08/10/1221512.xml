        <p>At a place best known as a scene of random, irrational violence, Gov. George E. Pataki today signed into law the strictest gun controls in the country.</p>
        <p>The governor presided over an emotional ceremony at the Merillon Avenue train station, a few yards from where Colin Ferguson fatally shot six people aboard a Long Island Rail Road train almost seven years ago.

        <p>At a place best known as a scene of random, irrational violence, Gov. George E. Pataki today signed into law the strictest gun controls in the country.</p>
        <p>The governor presided over an emotional ceremony at the Merillon Avenue train station, a few yards from where Colin Ferguson fatally shot six people aboard a Long Island Rail Road train almost seven years ago. A crowd of gun control advocates, state legislators of both parties and people who have lost spouses or children to gun violence cheered as Mr. Pataki put his signature on a bill that many of them said they never expected to see enacted.</p>
        <p>Alfredo Valentin has campaigned for gun controls since his son and a friend were shot to death in the Bronx six years ago. His voice choking, he said, ''Maybe, maybe today I have meaning.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki said of the new law, ''We hope this serves as a national model. We hope other states follow.''</p>
        <p>When the year began, all indications were that Albany's years-long stalemate over gun control would remain intact. Downstate lawmakers in both parties were nearly unanimous in favoring tougher restrictions, but they were consistently blocked by upstate Republicans in the State Senate.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pataki, a Republican, seized on the public sentiment created by a series of school shootings, proposed a wide-ranging package of controls and helped pressure the upstate senators into allowing the measure to come to a vote.</p>
        <p>In a Capitol often riven by partisanship, it was a rare bipartisan moment, a spirit very much in evidence today.</p>
        <p>United States Representative Carolyn McCarthy, a Democrat, embraced Mr. Pataki and kissed his cheek, and, her eyes brimming with tears, called him ''so courageous'' to have gone against the views of so many of the nation's leading Republicans. Ms. McCarthy's husband, Dennis, was one of the people killed aboard that train by Mr. Ferguson on Dec. 7, 1993; their son, Kevin, was gravely wounded. She soon became one of the most visible advocates of gun control, a position that propelled her to Congress three years later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, in turn, heaped praise on his traditional nemesis, the Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, acknowledging that the Assembly had been passing various elements of the package enacted today for more than a decade, only to see them die in the Senate.</p>
        <p>The National Rifle Association has criticized elements of the state's new gun law as infringing on the rights of gun owners, while the firearms industry has dismissed it as meaningless posturing that will have no real effect on violence.</p>
        <p>The law encompasses several measures, most of which have been tried in a few other states, though no other state has as broad a combination of restrictions. Most of the measures go into effect Nov. 1:</p>
        <p>*All new handguns will be required to be test-fired before they are sold, so that the telltale markings they leave on bullets and shell casings can be entered into a state computer database. New York is the second state to enact such a ''ballistic fingerprinting'' provision, a few days after Maryland. It goes into effect on March 1.</p>
        <p>*Assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition clips will be banned, mirroring the ban put into federal law in 1994. Local law enforcement officials have long complained that they needed a state law that would apply in state courts.</p>
        <p>*Background checks will be mandated for handgun buyers at gun shows. The federal background check requirement of the Brady Law applies only to federally licensed gun dealers, but most sales at gun shows are made by private citizens. The provision goes into effect immediately.</p>
        <p>*All new guns sold will be required to have trigger locks.</p>
        <p>*The legal age for getting a handgun permit and buying a handgun will rise to 21 from 18.</p>
        <p>*A new crime of criminal purchase of a weapon will be created for instances when someone buys a gun illegally or buys one for someone else who cannot legally buy one.</p>
        <p>*Gun owners will be required to report lost or stolen guns to the police.</p>
        <p>*A state police study of the sources of illegal guns in New York State will be mandated. Most of the guns are first bought in other states.</p>
        <p>*The state police will be instructed to study ''smart gun'' technology that would allow a gun to be fired only by its legal owner.</p>
        <p>Today, Joyce Gorycki, whose husband, James, was killed by Mr. Ferguson, recalled that she could not bring herself to go look for her husband at the station the night of the shooting. Today, she said, she could not have imagined staying away.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the most gratifying moments of my life,'' she said. ''It's nice to think that this place will become a symbol of something else.''</p>
