        <p>Following are excerpts from two books by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. The second, ''In Praise of Public Life,'' was written with Michael D'Orso.</p>
        <p>From ''The Scorpion and the Tarantula''</p>
        <p>This is primarily a study of the futile effort to control atomic energy and prohibit nuclear weapons, but if one is to understand this failure, it is necessary to consider the histories of the two principal participants in the effort, Russia and America, and to reflect on the state of their relations as the Second World War came to a close.</p>
        <p>The first and, in many ways, most critical dimension is space.  America was blessed with natural barriers. To its east and its west, two great oceans have provided security from attack. Russia, on the other hand, is exposed. Sitting on a vast plain, there is nothing of military consequence separating Russia from Asia to the east and Europe to the west. Russian history from its beginnings to our own time is characterized by continuous foreign military assaults, particularly from the west. . . . This is not a history likely to breed a nation of internationalists, a people who greeted foreigners with openness and were free of suspicion. This is a history that created a people haunted by fear, who lived without confidence and viewed the world outside with a sense of mistrust and inferiority.</p>
        <p>From ''In Praise of Public Life''</p>
        <p>Public confidence did not plummet overnight. It did not begin with Bill Clinton. Politicians and government have endured suspicion and a certain degree of scorn since the birth of this nation. This skepticism on the part of the American public is a grand tradition, as deeply rooted in our society as the spirit of freedom and independence and limited government. What is new, however, is the degree to which that suspicion and scorn have grown in the past 30 years. These three decades have seen an unprecedented parade of betrayals of the public's trust, from the deception that lay behind the Vietnam War, to the shock of the Watergate scandal, to Iran-contra and the partisan political and cultural warfare that erupted in the 1980's, to the personal attacks on public figures like Judge Robert Bork, Speaker Jim Wright and Justice Clarence Thomas, to the unseemly revelations of campaign finance wrongdoing in 1996, and on through the earth-shaking impeachment experience of 1998 and 1999.</p>
