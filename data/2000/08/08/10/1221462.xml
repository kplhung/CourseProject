        <p>A New Jersey man awaiting trial on charges that he was involved in a scheme that bilked investors of $100 million was indicted yesterday on charges that he conspired to murder the Manhattan judge who has kept him behind bars since April.</p>
        <p>The man, Stuart Winkler, 47, of Morganville, N.J., was charged with hiring a fellow prisoner to kill Justice Leslie Crocker Snyder of State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The judge has been handling a vast securities fraud case involving A. S. Goldmen, a Florida-based firm now out of business, since Mr. Winkler, who was its chief financial officer, and 32 others associated with the firm were indicted last summer.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said Mr. Winkler wanted the judge dead in the hope of having his case assigned to a more lenient jurist. Mr. Winkler was apparently angry that Justice  Snyder had increased his bail to $1 million in cash after he took a vacation in the Cayman Islands with his family over the Christmas holidays.</p>
        <p>Last summer, when he was indicted in the securities fraud case, Mr. Winkler had been required to post a $1 million bond, which he secured with a 10 percent cash payment to a bail agent.</p>
        <p>Although there is some dispute whether the Christmas trip violated Mr. Winkler's bail agreement, prosecutors complained to the judge, and the bail agent withdrew the $1 million bond. Justice Snyder then insisted on a full cash payment, which Mr. Winkler was unable to raise. He was sent to the Manhattan Detention Complex on April 11.</p>
        <p>According to a transcript of taped conversations in the jail, Mr. Winkler tried to hire another prisoner to kill the judge, telling him: ''Do it. It's a done deal. Don't worry about it. Just don't get caught.'' The other inmate was cooperating with the authorities and secretly taped Mr. Winkler.</p>
        <p>Excerpts from the transcript were read in court yesterday by Daniel McGillycuddy, an assistant district attorney, during Mr. Winkler's arraignment. In a brief appearance before Justice Arlene D. Goldberg, Mr. Winkler, looking tired and subdued, pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and criminal solicitation.</p>
        <p>''And don't do it around here because you might get caught,'' Mr. Winkler told the other prisoner, according to the transcript.  ''There's too many police. There's too many correction officers. There's too much stuff around here.''</p>
        <p>Prosecutors described the tapes, made during June and July, as ''rock solid'' evidence against Mr. Winkler, who they said  believed until a few days ago that his plan was moving forward. Mr. Winkler now faces up to 32 years in jail on the new charges. The prosecutors declined to release any information about the wired inmate, who was about to be released at the time of his contacts with Mr. Winkler. But Jack Litman, Mr. Winkler's lawyer, described the man as ''an inmate trying to work his way out of something'' by suggesting the murder plan.</p>
        <p>The defense lawyer suggested that there were other excerpts from the tapes that pointed to Mr. Winkler's innocence.</p>
        <p>Justice Snyder, who has heard some of the city's toughest drug and gang cases, including the so-called Wild Cowboys cases in the mid-1990's, was never in danger, the authorities said, but her already heavy security detail is nonetheless under review. The indictment says that Mr. Winkler provided the other inmate with details about courtroom security and the judge's summer vacation.</p>
        <p>''We are working very closely with the Police Department to ensure Judge Snyder's safety,'' said Daniel J. Castleman, the chief of investigations for the district attorney's office. ''There have been a number of cases over the past years where we had information that she had been threatened.''</p>
        <p>The judge would not speak to a reporter,  but David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the Office of Court Administration, said the indictment reflected ''the ugly side'' of law enforcement.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, this is not something that is new to Judge Snyder, and it will certainly not deter her from doing her job in the future,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr,. Bookstaver said it was likely that Justice Snyder would not hear the stock-fraud case against Mr. Winkler, because the district attorney's office was expected to request that it be separated from the rest of the Goldmen case.</p>
        <p>Bernard B. Kerik, the commissioner of correction and a longtime friend of the judge, said she had learned over the years to live with a highly visible security presence.  Mr. McGillycuddy described Mr. Winkler as an ongoing threat to Justice Snyder and requested that he be placed in solitary confinement at the Brooklyn House of Detention, where he can be more closely monitored. . He also requested that Mr. Winkler be allowed telephone contact only with his lawyers.</p>
        <p>But while Justice Goldberg ordered Mr. Winkler kept in isolation, she permitted visits from his wife and three children and also allowed him to call them.</p>
