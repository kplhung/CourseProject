        <p>A few thousand enthusiasts converge on Anaheim, Calif., today, ready for 10 days of play in the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals. The Life Master Pairs and the Spingold Knockout Teams will be the focus of attention, but dozens of lesser events draw players of all levels.</p>
        <p>A strong contingent from New York City goes to every national championship, and those players win more than their share of the top titles. One who is regularly in contention is Jim Krekorian of Manhattan, who sat South on the diagramed deal. It helped him win a pairs title at the Fall Nationals in Atlanta in 1986 with Drew Casen.</p>

        <p>A few thousand enthusiasts converge on Anaheim, Calif., today, ready for 10 days of play in the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals. The Life Master Pairs and the Spingold Knockout Teams will be the focus of attention, but dozens of lesser events draw players of all levels.</p>
        <p>A strong contingent from New York City goes to every national championship, and those players win more than their share of the top titles. One who is regularly in contention is Jim Krekorian of Manhattan, who sat South on the diagramed deal. It helped him win a pairs title at the Fall Nationals in Atlanta in 1986 with Drew Casen.</p>
        <p>At most tables North-South landed in four hearts and were usually defeated by two tricks, sometimes doubled. As shown, Casen and Krekorian maneuvered into three no-trump, a contract that had a chance. North could not rebid three hearts, which would have been nonforcing, and his three-club bid was an artificial checkback, hoping for a heart preference. North's final bid was not clear-cut but proved to be the winning action.</p>
        <p>West made a good decision by leading his singleton heart, and South played dummy's queen. East won with the king and returned a diamond. South took his ace and cashed four club winners, throwing hearts from the dummy. Thanks to the bidding and the lead, South was able to read this resulting position:</p>
        <p>[Diagram]</p>
        <p>On the lead of the last club, West was in trouble. If he had thrown a spade, South would have ducked a spade effectively. West therefore threw a diamond, and South led that suit. West won and returned the suit, but Krekorian found the counter: he ducked a spade, and scored two spade tricks at the finish to make his game.</p>
        <p>That was brilliant card-reading by Krekorian. Notice that if West had refused to win his diamond king in the diagramed position, South would have overtaken with the queen and led the eight, again endplaying West.</p>
