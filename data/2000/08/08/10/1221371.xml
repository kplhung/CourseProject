        <p>The Democratic National Convention, beginning here on Monday, has not prompted an extensive beautification of the city. But some projects have been speeded up for the delegates' arrival.</p>
        <p>Among them is the Gateway LAX Enhancement Project at Los Angeles International Airport. The photograph at far left, showing a project detail, suggests a 21st-century Stonehenge. But come convention time, this ring of decorative glass pylons will become flashing tubes of colored light at night. The 26-pylon project was designed by Ted Tokio Tanaka, an architect, with Paul Tzanetopoulos, a lighting designer; the LAX letters, top, were by Mr. Tanaka with the Selbert Perkins Design Collaborative.</p>

        <p>The boardwalk at Venice Beach and the Santa Monica beachfront are being overhauled, with new streetlights and improvements to a 3 1/2-mile oceanfront. New pagodas on the Venice boardwalk, at middle, are by the RRM Design Group, after unbuilt plans by Abbot Kinney, the visionary who built Venice early in the 20th century.</p>
        <p>Downtown, where the convention will take place at the Staples Arena, visitors can get a taste of old Los Angeles in a newly restored Pueblo de Los Angeles, the original center of the City of Angels in the mid-19th century. ARQ/Castro-Blanco Architects headed up the rehabilitation of the central plaza and the neighboring buildings, which, as Luis Hoyos, the project architect, put it, ''survived the onslaught of freeways and bad choices.'' Among the survivors is the 1930's Plaza Methodist Church, bottom.</p>
