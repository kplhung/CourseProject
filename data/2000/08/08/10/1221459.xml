        <p>With the American economy enjoying its longest economic expansion on record, the number of permanent layoffs declined over the last three years, the government reported yesterday. The rate may now match the lowest in the 20-year history of the survey.</p>
        <p>The new data also shows that women are now laid off virtually as often as men, closing a wide gap that had existed for most of the last 20 years. At the same time, the layoff rate for blacks rose. And the gap between the layoff rate for blacks compared with whites widened significantly over the last three years. The layoff rate for Hispanics, however, dropped sharply, falling below that of blacks. The differential between whites and Hispanics also narrowed.</p>
        <p>During the three years ended with 1999, 3.3 million workers on the job for three years or more were laid off while 4.3 million workers on the job for less than three years lost their jobs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in its biennial job displacement survey. This compares with total layoffs of 8 million, 3.6 million of them on the job for three years or more, from 1995 to 1997. And that is down from a total of 8.4 million in the period from 1993 through 1995.</p>
        <p>The decline in layoffs is more pronounced when calculated as a percentage of all employed workers. According to the bureau, that rate declined to 6.1 percent in the last three years, from 6.6 percent in 1995 through 1997 and 8 percent in 1993 through 1995. And this 6.1 percent may be near or even match the low for the survey, which goes back to 1979.</p>
        <p>The first bureau survey was released in 1984. But because the way the survey was conducted was changed from five-year periods to three-year periods in the report released in 1994, it is difficult to make historical comparisons. Steve Hipple, the economist at the bureau who oversees the job displacement data, said that the rate of job layoffs was probably understated in the earlier data.</p>
        <p>If this is the case, the 6.1 percent layoff rate from the last three years may actually be equal to the 5.5 percent rate reported for 1987 through 1989, the low point in the bureau's data.</p>
        <p>But the decline in the layoff rate in the last three years was far less than in the preceding three years, when the rate for all workers 20 years and older fell 17.5 percent.</p>
        <p>''It is not surprising that in a strong job market that job loss declined,'' said Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University who studies job displacement data. He said that even with a strong economy, there would be layoffs as some industries shrink while others grow.</p>
        <p>The lowest layoff rate, 5.7 percent, was for workers 45 to 54. Of all the displaced workers, nearly three-quarters had new jobs by the time the survey was taken in February. Nearly three-fifths of those laid off from wage and salary jobs found new jobs that paid the same or more.</p>
        <p>While the layoff rate for blacks did increase to 7.3 percent, it is still significantly below the level earlier in the 1990's, when it was as high as 9.4 percent between 1991 and 1995. The increase in the difference between the layoff rate for blacks and whites ends six years of narrowing. In the three-year period from 1991 through 1993, the gap was 1.4 percentage points. It narrowed to 0.5 percentage point in the next three-year period and was 0.6 percentage point in 1995 though 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hipple could not say why the gap had widened again. He said that the existence of a gap was consistent with the fact that the unemployment rate for whites is lower than that for blacks. But he said that it was hard to tell whether this year's widening of the gap was a one-time event or not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farber, who has worked with the bureau's jobs data for years, could not comment in detail on the change in the layoff rates for blacks because he had not yet received the backup data on which yesterday's release was based. But he said ''the black number is an interesting number and something to point out.''</p>
        <p>The layoff rate of Hispanics fell to 7 percent over the last three years from 8.8 percent. That is the lowest it has been since the the 1990-91 recession. The gap between the white and Hispanic layoff rate narrowed to 1 percentage point from 2.3 percentage points in the 1995-97 period.</p>
        <p>The gap between the layoff rate for women and men has been narrowing over the last 20 years, with the biggest changes coming in times of strong job growth. In 1991-93, the gap  was 7.4 percent for women and 8.8 percent for men. That narrowed to 7.6 percent for women and 8.4 percent for men in 1993-95, to 6.5 percent for women and 6.7 percent for men in 1995-97 and to 6.1 percent for women and 6 percent for men in the last three years.</p>
        <p>''Women's jobs are concentrated in service industries and the risk of job losses in services industries has grown over time,'' Mr. Hipple said.</p>
