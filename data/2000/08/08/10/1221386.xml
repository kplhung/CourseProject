      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>There's some explaining to do about the brilliant band playing at the Village Vanguard this week. At the moment New Directions is basically the alto saxophonist Greg Osby's quartet under another name,  with Mark Shim on tenor saxophone.  The group's original purpose when it formed last year and included the vibraphonist Stefon Harris was in part, to promote the Blue Note record label. It showed off the recent Blue Note signees Mr. Shim, Mr. Harris, and the pianist Jason Moran, alongside their frequent collaborator and ringleader Mr. Osby, by touring and recording together with a repertory of well-known tunes pulled from Blue Note records' back catalog -- a rather neat corporate idea.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Osby is a provocateur, and nothing bearing his name comes without some challenged assumptions. In Tuesday night's early set, the band didn't really stick to the concept of the Blue Note canon; the high level of group improvisation ensured that the audience didn't know what it would do next. The set had a streak of caustic, iconoclastic humor in it, but it wasn't a show of avant-gardist japes, nor did the humor take the form of static irony: these are practiced jazz musicians, trained to shift their music on the fly, from beautiful old-school ballad-playing to the most jolting, original undoings of jazz formula.</p>

        <p>There's some explaining to do about the brilliant band playing at the Village Vanguard this week. At the moment New Directions is basically the alto saxophonist Greg Osby's quartet under another name,  with Mark Shim on tenor saxophone.  The group's original purpose when it formed last year and included the vibraphonist Stefon Harris was in part, to promote the Blue Note record label. It showed off the recent Blue Note signees Mr. Shim, Mr. Harris, and the pianist Jason Moran, alongside their frequent collaborator and ringleader Mr. Osby, by touring and recording together with a repertory of well-known tunes pulled from Blue Note records' back catalog -- a rather neat corporate idea.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Osby is a provocateur, and nothing bearing his name comes without some challenged assumptions. In Tuesday night's early set, the band didn't really stick to the concept of the Blue Note canon; the high level of group improvisation ensured that the audience didn't know what it would do next. The set had a streak of caustic, iconoclastic humor in it, but it wasn't a show of avant-gardist japes, nor did the humor take the form of static irony: these are practiced jazz musicians, trained to shift their music on the fly, from beautiful old-school ballad-playing to the most jolting, original undoings of jazz formula.</p>
        <p>In Lee Morgan's ''Sidewinder,'' which closed the set, the musicians destabilized the song. It's a boogaloo blues with a fragmented melody, and the band refashioned it as a study in how to fall out of sync intentionally with itself. Mr. Moran played his lines halfway, then slowed them or shut them down; Nasheet Waits, the drummer, and Tarus Mateen, on bass, started from a position of lockstep funk, then imploded their rhythms, making beats stumble and the pulse plummet. They turned a popular, earthy dance tune into a strange, flexible form, coming up with the aural equivalent of Claes Oldenburg's soft sculptures.</p>
        <p>But shortly the whole thing changed. Picking up a two-note cue from Mr. Osby, the band shifted out of ''The Sidewinder'' into an insistent stuttering phrase, gathering momentum and volume, then shot into a free-for-all scrambled montage of Charlie Parker themes. There were two false endings, with applause, before the set was over; the band had fun throwing the audience off track.</p>
        <p>At other points the band linked ideas without stopping, getting inside two different pieces of music at once. One long stretch connected three ballads, with the standards ''I Didn't Know About You'' and ''You've Changed'' improbably bracketing a version of Bjork's ''Joga.'' In Thelonious Monk's ''Skippy'' and Mr. Moran's ''Gangsterism on Canvas,'' the band seemed unworried about expending energy whenever it wanted to: song-closing crescendos rose in the beginning, middle or end of a tune.</p>
        <p>The band's engine room is the threesome of Mr. Moran, Mr. Waits and Mr. Mateen, who regularly pulled away into their own intensive games, setting up opposing rhythmic ideas, with one leaving a maw of open space for the others to occupy.</p>
        <p>What all five players have in common is a rare synthesis of technique and style from different eras, making jazz's golden age and its current troubled one collide and make sense of each other. They all seem to have made peace with the challenge of being a jazz musician in the year 2000.</p>
        <p>The band plays through Sunday night at the Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street.</p>
