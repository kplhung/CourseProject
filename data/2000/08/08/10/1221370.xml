        <p>THE power of ones and zeroes is invading the centuries-old field of architecture, helping today's designers and artisans create structures that would otherwise be much more difficult -- or even impossible -- to build.</p>
        <p>The results can be seen in such showcased structures as the recently opened Experience Music Project in Seattle and the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, both by Frank Gehry. It is also apparent in the ambitious design, completed last fall, of the New York Presbyterian Church in Queens, an alteration of an older building.</p>
        <p>''If we didn't have computers,'' said Greg Lynn, one of the architects of the church project, ''the interior of this building would have been much simpler.''</p>
        <p>Regardless of whether computers take a leading role at the start of a project or later in the process, digital technologies are transforming the way buildings are designed and constructed. Computers can speed things up, allowing architects to compete in a world where everything needs to have been done yesterday. They also make it possible for architects to sell their designs to clients in new ways.</p>
        <p>The New York Presbyterian Church, in the Sunnyside neighborhood, features a large, open sanctuary that seats 2,500 and has a ceiling composed of warped surfaces, computer-designed ribbed forms that look different from different angles. On the building's exterior, a staircase is partly enclosed in a tunnel-like structure that shields arriving churchgoers from a view of the gritty industrial neighborhood yet gives them a view of the Manhattan skyline as they leave.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynn, an architect in Venice, Calif., who is also a professor at Zurich University's architectural school, and his colleagues -- Doug Garafalo in Chicago and Michael McInturf in Cincinnati -- are in the forefront of a group of architects who are creating complex shapes that emphasize continuity, rather than borders, between walls and ceilings. It is a style made feasible by the computer.</p>
        <p>''Before computers, you'd start designing using shapes of cubes,'' Mr. Lynn said. ''Now I can start with something like a handkerchief, an object that doesn't have strong inside and outside boundaries or much closed volume.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynn and other proponents of this type of architectural design are able to do that because they are using software that looks at shapes not as the product of a collection of straight lines that are each specified by fixed two-dimensional coordinates, but rather as the product of three-dimensional curves that can be defined by mathematical formulas. In this way, even a straight line can be defined as a curve -- just one that has not yet been inflected.</p>
        <p>''Without a computer, every point on a structure has to be calculated with reference to everything else,'' Mr. Lynn said. ''But by using a PC, I can create complex curves that don't have radii or centers. Since the entire form is tied into itself through a complex mathematical equation, I can easily push and pull the shape and have the equation automatically recalculate the new relationships within that form. If I tried to do that by hand, a day's work would take a couple of years -- literally.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynn has thrown away the architect's tools of wooden models and hand-drawn diagrams in exchange for a practice based solely on software. Using 3-D animation programs like Maya, Mr. Lynn creates structures that can be rotated on the screen in three dimensions and covered with textures and shadows.</p>
        <p>The Queens church is a $10 million structure that was built atop an Art Moderne building, the old Knickerbocker Laundry Factory, which had 88,000 square feet. When working on the church, Mr. Lynn sent his files via modem to his two partners. Some of those same files were also sent to materials fabricators who used computer-controlled machinery to cut needed materials automatically with high degrees of precision.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Lynn works to create forms that would not be practical without computers, others, like Mr. Gehry, continue to create in real, rather than virtual, space. Mr. Gehry, based in Santa Monica, Calif., does not use computers to create a design, but he uses them to communicate the design's essentials to those who will ultimately execute the plan. Without computers, carrying out Mr. Gehry's designs would be extremely difficult.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gehry's most-celebrated recent structures also include the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, as well as the museums in Seattle and Bilbao. All those projects began with wooden models, which were translated into three-dimensional digitized computer files only after the architects were satisfied with the designs. Those digital files then served as a nexus for parts suppliers, fabricators and contractors around the world, all of whom had access to one central, tightly controlled online source of documentation.</p>
        <p>One strong advocate of digital design is Terry Beaubois, an architect who is also director of the Palo Alto, Calif., chapter of the American Institute of Architects. ''My goal is to be able to retrieve, view, store, modify and send my architectural files to collaborators, clients and manufacturers,'' Mr. Beaubois said, ''so that we can all view things in three dimensions on the computer.''</p>
        <p>The need to draw designs on paper has slowed architects down. Not only do building designs generate reams of paper plans, with multiple copies of blueprints for every participant in the project, but every product used in a building must be drawn fresh each time. In a study conducted by Mr. Beaubois,  he learned that in some cases, an item as simple as a toilet would be drawn multiple times: by the manufacturer, for its brochure; by the architects, for their design; by the subcontractor, for more detailed shop drawings; and by the facilities manager, to create the post-construction ''as built'' drawings. And all those drawings are two-dimensional, making it hard to visualize them accurately.</p>
        <p>Computers can minimize such delays. Using computer modeling, and using the computer to forward files electronically to his client, Mr. Beaubois recently completed plans for a 10,000-square-foot house, including a guest house and stable, in just five  days, instead of the weeks or months such a project would usually take.</p>
        <p>''Before this technology, you could go to lunch while waiting for an element in a design to be redrawn,'' Mr. Beaubois said. ''Now, with tools such as Photoshop, I can create and recreate something in an instantaneous flow. If a client doesn't like something, I can change it immediately, and no misunderstanding or mistrust is created. It's like Wolfgang Puck cooking your meal to order in front of you.''</p>
        <p>The renderings produced with a computer can be much easier for clients to understand. Architects like Mark Miller, co-owner of Miller, Kelley Architects of San Francisco, are creating highly detailed, animated ''fly-overs'' of their computer-generated structures.</p>
        <p>To illustrate Mr. Miller's concept for a new General Motors design center in Warren, Mich., the firm created a five-minute animated film. Viewers feel as though they are sitting in a helicopter as a daredevil pilot swings up, around and even through the building, walls and all.</p>
        <p>''Our animations are so literal,'' Mr. Miller said, ''our clients think they're almost watching a photograph. And they want their building to look exactly like the animation.''</p>
        <p>This sophisticated short film took 20 linked computers one week to create. Software that would allow a viewer to choose a path to travel around a highly detailed neighborhood in real time does not yet exist.</p>
        <p>Some architects look forward to faster computers that will let them create life-size three-dimensional models that can be projected on a wall and be viewed from any angle. Even when such a trick becomes possible, there will be some limitations: No matter how much one twists and turns a three-dimensional computer model of a structure, in some ways it is still a two-dimensional experience. The image is displayed on a flat surface like a computer screen. The viewer cannot really walk around it, peer into its windows or run in and out of it to understand the relationship of the building to its surroundings.</p>
        <p>While computers may speed up the design process, they, like any medium, including the human hand, impose their own artistic limitations. Depending on the software used, buildings can take on a particular look.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I see a finished building and say, 'Oh, yeah, that was made using Form Z,' '' said Charles Stilworth, an architect in Studios Architecture. ''If you develop a project using AutoCAD, which favors extrusions, it'll come out different than if you used Maya, which can replicate wave actions. If you're smart, you'll pick a program based on what's in your head.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gehry prefers to develop his concepts on paper, creating more and sophisticated physical models as his ideas take shape. Once the design is set, the physical model is digitized by plotting various coordinates, using a tool developed for neurosurgeons. The resulting points are then manipulated on the computer in Catia, a modeling program originally created for the French aerospace industry.</p>
        <p>The original design for the Disney Concert Hall called for stone cladding across the exterior. The firm used the computer to streamline the design, reducing the variation in the stone shapes and thereby cutting fabrication costs. The plan was to manufacture the cladding through an automated process to cut costs and to have computer data sent electronically from Mr. Gehry's office to the plant to control the machinery that would cut the material. The cladding was eventually changed from stone to metal to meet seismic requirements. But Jim Glymph, a partner in Mr. Gehry's firm, said the time was near when these kinds of novel designs ''will cost no more than mass-produced products.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Glymph is entranced by computers not because they can create designs, but because they can help bring efficiency to the now-chaotic control process inherent in construction. The construction industry, however, is still far from the time when laborers  will walk around every building site with laptops, checking the latest updates to the buildings' designs.</p>
        <p>A typical construction project can generate up to 10,000 documents. ''The paper process is imbedded in this industry,'' Mr. Glymph said. ''The generation of permits, legal processes and plans is all done on paper. In construction, there's always a change that will wind up generating thousands of documents. On the Disney Concert Hall, switching from stone to metal cladding alone meant that we had to make 5,000 new drawings.''</p>
        <p>Within a decade, Mr. Glymph and others say, the design and fabrication process will become much more centralized, and the Internet will become a hub for the business. All documents will be posted in a central location. Contractors and fabricators will receive different levels of access to plans -- some will be able to modify them while others will only be able to read them.</p>
        <p>Materials fabricators anywhere will be able to download specifications and create samples to compete for a construction contract. As a result, the Internet has the potential to let more people compete in the construction industry. Previously unknown artisans, even those working in remote villages, will be able to vie for contracts if they have Internet access, and that will give  architects more choices.</p>
        <p>''Eventually, we'll be able to create computerized plans that, when you click on a certain part of it, will show all of an object's attributes,'' said Mr. Beaubois, of the American Institute of Architects. ''That way, a contractor will be able to get information without having to call the architect. High-speed Internet access will allow this to happen.''</p>
        <p>He added, referring to the architectural flowering during the Renaissance, ''Thanks to computers, this is the most exciting time in architectural history since 1492.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 17, 2000, Thursday  An article in Circuits last Thursday about the role of computers in architecture misidentified the architectural firm that created an animated film illustrating the concept for a new General Motors building. The film was created by Kaplan McLaughlin Diaz of San Francisco and overseen by one of the firm's project directors, Mark Miller. (It was later that Mr. Miller established a firm, Miller, Kelly Architects of San Francisco.)</p>
