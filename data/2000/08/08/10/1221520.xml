        <p>The faces they present for the outside world are similar. Andy Pettitte offers a smile and greetings delivered in a soothing Louisiana drawl, and if you read his lips on the mound in the worst of times, the words are G-rated.</p>
        <p>Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, is the sort of person who could get stuck on an elevator and find something good in it, as an unfailing optimist. David Cone has known Stottlemyre for more than a decade and can remember seeing his anger only one time, on the night the Mets were eliminated in 1989.</p>
        <p>The inner beings hidden by Pettitte and Stottlemyre are alike, as well; both are raging competitors. For all that they share and the many years they have spent together, Pettitte is coping as best he can with the absence of Stottlemyre, who left the team Monday to be treated for bone marrow cancer.</p>
        <p>Pettitte and the Yankees dominated Oakland, 12-1, last night and the left-hander improved his record to 13-6.</p>
        <p>Oakland's Kevin Appier was terrible, walking six and hitting a batter in three and two-thirds innings, allowing seven hits and 10 runs, and the Yankees feasted all night. Tino Martinez blasted a grand slam and drove in five runs, Scott Brosius collected four hits, Jorge Posada crushed his 21st homer, and Bernie Williams banged his 26th home run -- the 18th hit into the black section in center field in the remodeled Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have scored 163 runs in 26 games since the All-Star Game break, an average of 6.3 a game, or about a run a game more than they averaged before the break.</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre was not at Yankee Stadium last night to witness the wipeout, to see Pettitte maintain his concentration throughout a long game played on a muggy evening. When Pettitte threw in the bullpen on Sunday, Stottlemyre told him of his plans -- the pitching coach is being hospitalized this week and will miss the Yankees' road trip.</p>
        <p>Pettitte's pitching is built on habits. He likes his workout routine to be consistent; he hates to have an extra day of rest between starts; he likes to work with the same catcher; he always keeps the bill of his cap low, an attempt to block out anything that exists besides the hitter and his catcher.</p>
        <p>He walked to the bullpen to warm up before last night's game with his pitching coach -- Billy Connors, rather than Stottlemyre. ''It was a little different walking with Billy,'' Pettitte said after the game. ''You do your same routine whether it's Billy or Mel. I did the same with Billy that I would've done with Mel; you've done the same thing so many times.''</p>
        <p>But it's different. Stottlemyre has been his pitching coach since the outset of the 1996 season, working closely with the left-hander. Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, mentioned yesterday how it is he, Torre, who gets all the credit for staving off the possible trade of Pettitte in July 1999. In fact, Torre said, he took his cue from Stottlemyre and his reading of Pettitte's problems last summer, and his faith that Pettitte would rebound.</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre possesses a special insight into Pettitte's psyche, perhaps because of their similar demeanors -- ''Fire and Brimstone,'' Torre called them. There have been games when Pettitte has stomped back to the dugout after a bad inning, hurling his glove and cap against the bench and retreating to the clubhouse angrily.</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre would turn and give Torre a broad and knowing smile -- imagine the Joker, Batman's nemesis -- then follow Pettitte, to calm the left-hander.</p>
        <p>The absence of Stottlemyre, said the reliever Mike Stanton, ''is obviously going to bother Andy. He's been his pitching coach since Day 1. It bothers all of us. But it is good to know that he's doing well and that this isn't a permanent thing, that it's just a short-term thing.''</p>
        <p>Presumably, Stottlemyre found a way to follow Pettitte's outing against the Athletics; presumably, he was exceptionally pleased. Pettitte threw strikes, spun his breaking ball, jammed Oakland's hitters early in the game and kept his fastball away late in the game.</p>
        <p>The hot weather felt good to him, probably like home. He would get out to the mound and get loose quickly, wiping sweat from his forehead and his upper lip with his glove between pitches. Pettitte adjusted to the consistent but confined strike zone of Doug Eddings, the plate umpire.</p>
        <p>The same could not be said for Appier, who kept falling behind the count and then paying the price. Posada hammered his homer in the second inning, and in the third, Appier walked home a run before allowing the grand slam to Martinez, who has 69 runs batted in and is on pace to surpass 100 once more.</p>
        <p>The Yankees scored four more runs in the fourth inning, and Pettitte was able to relax and pitch aggressively without real fear. He carried his shutout into the eighth, when Sal Fasano hit a homer, and was relieved for the ninth, after allowing seven hits.</p>
        <p>Pettitte is mostly guarded in his feelings about Stottlemyre, who asked the pitchers not to treat him any differently this season. Pettitte is proceeding as if nothing is different, in these days when Stottlemyre is away from the team.</p>
        <p>But it is different, of course. ''We've hit it off, as pitching coach and player,'' Pettitte said, ''and I love him dearly.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>In discussing his defense Tuesday, third baseman SCOTT BROSIUS remarked how much more focused he is when the pitchers work fast and the game moves quickly. Last night's game dragged painfully -- the first four innings took nearly two hours -- and Brosius committed an error on a grounder hit by ADAM PIATT, his first since June 2, ending his streak of 54 games without an error.</p>
