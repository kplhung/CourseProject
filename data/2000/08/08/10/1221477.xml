        <p>A federal appeals court ruling cleared the way for the sale of a generic version of Prozac, the world's top-selling antidepressant, as early as next summer, about two years earlier than expected.</p>
        <p>The ruling was good news for the 38 million people around the world who have taken Prozac. The generic version could be priced at less than one-third of the current price of the drug. But Eli Lilly, which makes Prozac, said it would appeal the ruling. Lilly sold $2.6 billion of Prozac last year, and the drug now makes up about 26 percent of the company's revenue.</p>
