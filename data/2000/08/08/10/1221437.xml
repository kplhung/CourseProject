        <p>Editorial warns says between India and Pakistan over Kashmir could spur nuclear war; lauds Pres Clinton's efforts to nudge both sides toward dialogue</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Clinton administration is right to be concerned about the military confrontation between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, a conflict that American intelligence agencies now judge to be one of the world's most perilous. The dispute over who will control India's only Muslim-majority state has already provoked two wars. That was before New Delhi and Islamabad acquired nuclear bombs and medium-range missiles. Now any resumption of full-scale conflict carries the risk of starting a nuclear war between the two nations.</p>
        <p>The world survived four decades of nuclear confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union because Washington and Moscow established rules of behavior and crisis management. The two superpowers waged proxy battles in the third world, but rarely challenged each other's most vital interests or survival. By contrast, India and Pakistan dispute a common land border not very distant from either Islamabad or New Delhi. Many Pakistanis, raised in a country founded on the principle of religious separatism, believe the Muslims of Kashmir must be liberated from Indian rule. India feels that retaining Kashmir is essential to its survival as a diverse, multicultural nation.</p>

        <p>The Clinton administration is right to be concerned about the military confrontation between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, a conflict that American intelligence agencies now judge to be one of the world's most perilous. The dispute over who will control India's only Muslim-majority state has already provoked two wars. That was before New Delhi and Islamabad acquired nuclear bombs and medium-range missiles. Now any resumption of full-scale conflict carries the risk of starting a nuclear war between the two nations.</p>
        <p>The world survived four decades of nuclear confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union because Washington and Moscow established rules of behavior and crisis management. The two superpowers waged proxy battles in the third world, but rarely challenged each other's most vital interests or survival. By contrast, India and Pakistan dispute a common land border not very distant from either Islamabad or New Delhi. Many Pakistanis, raised in a country founded on the principle of religious separatism, believe the Muslims of Kashmir must be liberated from Indian rule. India feels that retaining Kashmir is essential to its survival as a diverse, multicultural nation.</p>
        <p>America cannot calm this dangerous conflict overnight. But it must nudge both sides toward dialogue. President Clinton took some useful steps on his South Asia trip earlier this year. He warned Pakistan, which has often enjoyed American support in the past, that it should not assume Washington will come to its rescue if it provokes a new conflict with India. In India, Mr. Clinton stressed American friendship and desire for better relations, but also urged New Delhi to seek political dialogue with Pakistan.</p>
        <p>India must also start talks with militant Muslim groups in Kashmir. A promising initiative with one such group, Hizbul Mujahedeen, broke down on Tuesday, leading the militants to end a brief cease-fire. One problem was Hizbul Mujahedeen's insistence that Pakistan be represented at the talks, something India refuses to accept. Washington should press both sides to come back to the table without preconditions. Every reasonable effort must be made to avoid a new Kashmir war.</p>
