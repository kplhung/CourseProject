        <p>Toward the end of the first scene of ''Beggar on Horseback,'' the character Dr. Rice gives his friend Neil a pill. It's not clear what's in the pill, but whatever it is it produces one bummer of a trip for the audience that has to sit through Neil's hallucinations for the next hour and a half.</p>
        <p>From the title on the program, the show being staged by the Peccadillo Theater Company is ostensibly meant to be a revival of the 1924 comedy by George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly, but you would never know it from what takes place onstage in Dan Wackerman's version.</p>

        <p>Toward the end of the first scene of ''Beggar on Horseback,'' the character Dr. Rice gives his friend Neil a pill. It's not clear what's in the pill, but whatever it is it produces one bummer of a trip for the audience that has to sit through Neil's hallucinations for the next hour and a half.</p>
        <p>From the title on the program, the show being staged by the Peccadillo Theater Company is ostensibly meant to be a revival of the 1924 comedy by George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly, but you would never know it from what takes place onstage in Dan Wackerman's version.</p>
        <p>The original was a satire played out in a dream sequence that was full of Kaufman's sarcastic wit and wisecracks. Mr. Wackerman has turned it into the sort of skit that one might put together to amuse one's friends and relatives (and which only friends and relatives could find amusing). The dream ends up being one of those nightmares that never seem to end.</p>
        <p>The story, such as it is, concerns Neil McRae, a young composer who is spinning out Web-site jingles instead of the great symphony the artist in him wants to write. To free his creative genius from monetary cares he contemplates marrying Gladys, the daughter of wealthy philistines, rather than Cynthia, the girl across the hall whom he loves. Dr. Rice, Neil's best friend, gives him that pill, and the rest of the play is Neil's bad dream about being married to Gladys.</p>
        <p>In an apparent attempt to update and freshen the play, Mr. Wackerman has inserted forced and tired references to the Web, cell phones and the New York disco and club scene. He has also added some canned hip-hop and funk music that blares at the least provocation and brings on a chorus line of a half-dozen or so dancers, some of whom are not bad and whose brief numbers, choreographed by Bev Brown, are the best part of the show.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wackerman seems to have encouraged exaggerated performances that are merely loud rather than energetic and he moves the action at a pace that can only be described as frantic. As Neil, Todd Allen Durkin appears to be trying to impersonate a Tom Hanks on speed.</p>
        <p>Tara Sands succeeds in making Gladys as obnoxious as she is apparently intended to be. Alicia Minshew has a certain girl-next-door quality, and Robert Tyree comes the closest to creating a real character in his portrayal of Dr. Rice.</p>
        <p>BEGGAR ON HORSEBACK</p>
        <p>By George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly; directed by Dan Wackerman; choreography by Bev Brown; assistant director, Arley Tapirian; production stage manager, Paul A. Powell; slide photography, David Fuhrer; sets and costumes by Anne Lommel; lighting by Mark Simpson; sound by Robert Auld. Presented by the Peccadillo Theater Company. At the Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village.</p>
        <p>WITH: Todd Allen Durkin (Neil McRae), Alicia Minshew (Cynthia Mason), Tara Sands (Gladys Cady), Robert Tyree (Dr. Albert Rice and others) and Ernesto Altamirano (Georgie and others).</p>
