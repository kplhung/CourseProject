        <p>A CHILD'S room is a stage where children squawk like parrots, transform themselves into Hansel and Gretel or paint, fresh from their imaginations, a picture of a red tree on a cobalt blue ground. The more visible the toys, the easier it is for a child to play.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mark and Nancy Zvonkovic asked Robin Elmslie Osler, a Manhattan architect, to turn two maids' rooms into a bedroom-study for their daughter Andie, then 2. Their request was basic: a bed, built-in desk, and lots of shelves and drawers, Ms. Osler said.</p>

        <p>A CHILD'S room is a stage where children squawk like parrots, transform themselves into Hansel and Gretel or paint, fresh from their imaginations, a picture of a red tree on a cobalt blue ground. The more visible the toys, the easier it is for a child to play.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mark and Nancy Zvonkovic asked Robin Elmslie Osler, a Manhattan architect, to turn two maids' rooms into a bedroom-study for their daughter Andie, then 2. Their request was basic: a bed, built-in desk, and lots of shelves and drawers, Ms. Osler said.</p>
        <p>Andie most likes the lidded opening behind the headboard, which is 14 inches deep and 24 inches wide. She transformed the space into a theater for one. ''She would draw scenery on a piece of paper,'' Ms. Osler said, ''hang it on top of the lid of the opening, and do puppet shows in front.''</p>
        <p>Improv space is also what Liz Stern, the mother of two girls, 2 and 3, wanted when she recently asked Marco Pasanella, a Manhattan designer, to create a playroom in their Upper West Side apartment. She asked for what she called stations for children's play, reminiscent of a kindergarten class, with plastic bins full of toys on shelves, but more delightful. ''Children can see where the toys are, take them out of the bin, and clean up after themselves,'' said Mrs. Stern, who has taught kindergarten and nursery school and is now a full-time mother and the wife of Emanuel Stern, president of Hartz Mountain Industries, which owns the TriBeCa Grand and SoHo Grand hotels in Manhattan. What is visible will be played with; what is invisible will not.</p>
        <p>''There will be an art station with table and chairs and all the supplies at their own level,'' Mrs. Stern said. ''There will be a computer station and a television station. There will be a cozy, nooky kind of area and a dress-up area.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want a lot of color, because the color comes out of their own artwork. If you design a room that is too representational or too colorful, it becomes stifling to the imagination.''</p>
        <p>The room will have pale yellow or green walls and a wood floor warmed by a cotton rug -- but it won't be empty. Mr. Pasanella will make the 12-by-17-foot room as conducive to daydreaming as to building a toy kingdom ruled by co-princesses. The intention is that the room will be functional, not fanciful. ''It's condescending to make everything look like Romper Room, meaning that everything is a caricature, and colors are exaggerated,'' Mr. Pasanella said.</p>
        <p>The playroom, which will be built this fall, will provide instant gratification. The children will be able to draw, paint and display their art all in one space.  A four-foot-wide roll of kraft paper will hang permanently on the wall. Not only will the children be able to paint on the paper upright, but their mother imagines a day when they will also paint with their feet. ''They can put it on the floor, stick their feet in paint and walk on the paper,'' Mrs. Stern said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pasanella has designed two display areas for artwork. Two large linen-covered Homasote boards will be mounted on the wall, on either side of the roll of paper. The bottom third of the wall is markerboard, or porcelain on steel, so washable markers can be wiped clean and magnets can affix art and photographs.</p>
        <p>The design calls for a row of pegs mounted just above the markerboard, so the children can hang up their dresses, hats and scarves after playing dress-up.  Mrs. Stern nurtures the faint hope that if there are lots of bins and hooks and cubbies, the girls will clean up after themselves. ''We'll see,'' Mr. Pasanella said.</p>
        <p>For daydreaming, moon-gazing or cuddling, the design specifies low window seats with open storage underneath. Along with curtains, Mr. Pasanella has called for a pull-down canvas shade, which the children will be encouraged to paint.</p>
        <p>Since children like to be on the floor, the television will be placed in the fireplace, set on andirons that have been rubberized for safety. The mirror above the fireplace tilts down, so the children can look up and see themselves. The fourth wall will contain shallow shelves to hold the books, games, stuffed animals, paints, crayons and puzzles that make up a child's world.</p>
        <p>Furniture? Very little. A table with bins, and a bed on casters for sleepovers. Mostly there will be floor space. And plenty of room for a child's imagination.</p>
        <p>Specs</p>
        <p>TO make a playroom enticing, Marco Pasanella, a Manhattan interior designer, provided, among other things, lots of art supplies and display areas. He also paid attention to safety, coating a set of andirons with rubber before turning them into a television stand in an unused fireplace.</p>
        <p>Boards for Drawing and Display: The bottom third of one wall is unframed porcelain-over-steel markerboard. Mr. Pasanella pointed out that the panels must be professionally installed because the edges are razor sharp and must be covered. (Melamine, a synthetic resin, can also be used, framed or unframed, though it may discolor over time.) A 4-by-8-foot panel of markerboard is $471; the same size in melamine is $104 (prices may change). Both from Demco, (800) 356-1200.</p>
        <p>Homasote bulletin boards made of recycled wastepaper are available at many lumberyards. A 4-by-8-foot version is about $20. Homasote can be covered in Belgian linen (about $23 for a yard 54 inches wide), from Pearl Paint, (800) 221-6845.</p>
        <p>Rubberizing: Prices vary, but it costs about $100 to dip a pair of andirons. Patterson Rubber, (973) 595-6661.</p>
        <p>Kraft paper rolls: A 900-foot roll (four feet wide) is about $50 at Wolf Paper &amp; Twine, (212) 675-4870 .</p>
        <p>Designer/architects: Marco Pasanella, (212) 989-5373; Robin Elmslie Osler, (212) 989-0652.</p>
