        <p>MANHATTAN: WEST NILE MEETING URGED  A coalition of New York environmentalists, repeating their view yesterday that widespread pesticide spraying against the West Nile virus may threaten the public more than the virus itself, said they had asked to meet with Dr. Neal L. Cohen, New York City's health commissioner. ''The overuse of toxic pesticides to combat this virus creates an insidious air of false security,'' said Adrienne Esposito, of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment. A Health Department spokeswoman said yesterday that Dr. Cohen had not yet received the request.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: FIRE DISRUPTS ELECTRICITY  A smoky electrical fire in a manhole on West 80th Street last night knocked out power to 59 customers, Consolidated Edison said. The cause of the fire at West 80th and Columbus Avenue, which started at 11:15 p.m. and burned some underground cables before being put out an hour later, was not clear, Con Ed and the Fire Department said. The utility did not know early this morning when service would be restored, said D. Joy Faber, a spokeswoman.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: STOP SIGN INSTALLED BEFORE PROTEST  One month after a 9-year-old boy was hit by a car and killed at the intersection and one day before a neighborhood protest was planned there, the Department of Transportation agreed to install a stop sign on 24th Avenue at 83rd Street in Brooklyn. Local residents and elected officials had lobbied for a sign for years. Carmine Santa Maria, president of the Bensonhurst West End Community Council, said the avenue from 86th Street to Stillwell Avenue had no lights or stop signs and had been the scene of many accidents.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: PHONY DENTIST PLEADS GUILTY  A Kew Gardens man has pleaded guilty to posing as a dentist in Jamaica, Queens, and treating more than 100 Medicaid patients. Since last August, the man, Ramin Setarehshenas, had operated an office called Colosseum Dental and had examined teeth, taken X-rays and written prescriptions, according to Attorney General Eliot L.

        <p>MANHATTAN: ACTIVIST MISSING IN INDONESIA  Human Rights Watch, a human rights group based in Manhattan, urged the Indonesian government yesterday to increase efforts to find a lawyer and activist from Queens who vanished five days ago in Sumatra. The group said it feared that the lawyer, Jafar Siddiq Hamzah, 35, might have been kidnapped by Indonesian military or paramilitary troops on Saturday. The group said Indonesia's regional military commander had denied any knowledge of Mr. Hamzah's whereabouts, and appeals by the United States Embassy in Jakarta to the government had yielded no results.</p>

        <p>SCHENECTADY: TURBOTRAINS ARRIVE  The first of seven turbocharged Amtrak trains has been delivered to Amtrak by Super Steel Schenectady. The train, designed to travel 125 miles per hour on part of the route between Schenectady and New York City, is being inspected and tested before it goes into service this autumn. The second of the seven trains will be delivered to Amtrak in coming months and the rest completed by late 2002, said Lynn Bowersox, an Amtrak spokeswoman.</p>

        <p>SYRACUSE: INDIAN LAND CLAIMS  Testimony is to resume next week in the second phase of the Cayuga Indian Nation's land claims trial, in which the tribe is seeking nearly $2 billion in interest. The money would be added to a $36.9 million award granted by a jury in February. Judge Neal McCurn of Federal District Court ruled in 1994 that New York illegally acquired 64,027 acres of reservation land in Cayuga and Seneca Counties in 1795 and 1807. An economist for the Cayugas plans to testify that the state should pay $1.74 billion in interest calculated back to 1795. The Justice Department's economist says the interest should be $527.5 million, while the state's expert economist plans to argue that New York should pay $12.1 million. at most.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: SENTENCING IN UNDER-AGE SEX CASE  A Superior Court judge on Tuesday agreed to reduce the sentence of a bus driver and self-proclaimed witch who was convicted of having sex with a 14-year-old boy. The woman, Kerri Lynn Patavino, 32, was convicted in 1997 for engaging in what was described as ritualistic sex with the boy while she was his bus driver at a Trumbull middle school. The judge cut the six-year sentence by a year after Ms. Patavino publicly apologized for the first time. She had previously denied the charges and had already served one year of her sentence.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: MOST CRIMES FALL  Crime in New Jersey last year, with the exception of car theft, dropped about 6 percent from the year before, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman reported yesterday. Reports of murder dropped 11 percent, rape 13 percent, and domestic violence 1 percent. Motor vehicle theft, however, rose 1 percent. New Jersey's decline mirrors the national crime rate, which fell 7 percent last year.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: SUSPECT IN EARLIER ECSTASY ARREST  A college student charged last week in one of New Jersey's largest seizures of the drug Ecstasy had been arrested in New York City three weeks earlier on similar charges. On July 8, the student, Brian Juliano, 23, a senior at Monmouth University, was charged by police officers in Brooklyn with possession of 5,000 tablets of Ecstasy. He was free on bail when he was arrested at a New Jersey warehouse with, the police said, 45,000 doses of the drug, valued at $1.5 million. His lawyer said Mr. Juliano would plead not guilty in both cases.</p>

        <p>GLASSBORO: SPRINKLERS AT COLLEGE DORMS  Spurred by a new state law and by the deaths of students in a fire at Seton Hall University, Rowan University has finished installing a new fire sprinkler system in time for fall classes. Rowan spent $1.9 million to install sprinklers in on-campus apartments and 17 dormitories, and spent nearly $143,000 on batteries for smoke detectors. In January, three students died in a Seton Hall University dormitory that had no sprinklers. A state law in July made such sprinklers necessary.</p>
