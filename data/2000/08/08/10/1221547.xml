        <p>A center fielder ran up a five-foot hill in the deepest part of any major league park in pursuit of a home run. The flight of a line drive stopped suddenly when the ball landed in the first row of nearby bleachers. A triple got wedged beneath the padding in the right-field corner.</p>
        <p>This is Enron Field, the zany new home of the Houston Astros. Darryl Hamilton loves it.</p>
        <p>Hamilton returned to the Mets last night, and in his first at-bat in four months, he punched a curveball from Jason Green to left field. As Hamilton chugged around the bases -- with no pain in his arthritic left big toe -- he saw the ball heading for an unusual corner in the gap, where the side of the out-of-town scoreboard angles back to meet the wall.</p>
        <p>His drive caromed off the top of the padding adjoining the side wall and landed in the Mets' bullpen. Home run -- somehow.</p>
        <p>''That's a weird, weird structure in the gap,'' Hamilton said after the Mets' 12-5 victory. ''Who knows what they were thinking with that, but hats off to them -- it definitely helped me out.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton's two-run homer came as a pinch-hitter, after the Mets had built a five-run lead that was enough for Rick Reed, who worked seven solid innings despite admitting he had only two pitches. ''I didn't have anything,'' said Reed, who nonetheless improved his record to 7-2. ''I was making up stuff, dropping down. I just didn't have it.''</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the Mets, Jose Lima didn't have it, either. The Astros right-hander, who won 21 games last year, dropped his 14th this season by failing to get out of the fourth. He gave up seven runs, quickly turning the game into a blowout that allowed Mets Manager Bobby Valentine to escape, for a day, his inevitable outfield quandary. How does Valentine deliver playing time in left and center field to the veteran Hamilton and the surging young players Benny Agbayani and Jay Payton? Valentine is already tiring of the questions; after the game, he said, ''I don't think it's that big a deal.''</p>
        <p>But the players involved do, to an extent. All three insist winning is the only goal, and that as long as the Mets keep doing that -- they have won 12 of 15 games -- they will be fine. But Agbayani and Payton have succeeded partly because they have found a rhythm from playing every day.</p>
        <p>''You get concerned because you're really into the groove right now,'' Agbayani said. ''You don't know how it's going to be when someone breaks it up.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton took Agbayani's place tonight, playing left field for the first time in nearly seven years. Valentine removed Hamilton to get an at-bat for Bubba Trammell in the eighth, when Mike Piazza sent Richard Hidalgo scurrying in vain up the center-field hill for his 445-foot, three-run home run. That shot, Piazza's 30th, was what players were talking about after the game, with apologies to Hamilton. ''The sentimental moment's just blown out the window when a guy hits one 440,'' third baseman Robin Ventura said.</p>
        <p>Piazza, of course, is used to such blasts. Payton's homer in the second inning was his first since July 13, and although he did not clobber it -- it landed in the first row of the bleachers in left -- Payton was encouraged. He has been bothered since early July by a sprained left wrist, and he had found himself favoring the wrist out of fear that he would strain it.</p>
        <p>''My hand's starting to feel a lot better,'' Payton said. ''The last three or four weeks, I've been more of a slap hitter.''</p>
        <p>Payton's home run was the 36th Lima has allowed this year, and his problems returned in the third. Agbayani doubled off the right-field wall, then Derek Bell lined a ball into the right-field corner, where it got stuck under the padded wall. Bell got a run-scoring triple.</p>
        <p>When Reed singled off Green to lead off the sixth, every Met in the starting lineup had gotten a hit. But, Reed knew, the night belonged to a player who did not start.</p>
        <p>''His confidence is just zooming,'' Reed said of Hamilton. ''To come back and hit a home run in his first at-bat -- welcome back, Darryl Hamilton.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Catcher MIKE PIAZZA returned to the lineup after missing three games with a sprained left knee, and second baseman EDGARDO ALFONZO was back after missing one game with a groin strain. Alfonzo has also been slowed by a sore hip, and that injury probably explains why he has not homered since July 4. . . . The Class AA Binghamton Mets won their 15th game in a row on Tuesday, matching the Atlanta Braves' early-season streak for the longest winning streak in professional baseball this year.</p>
