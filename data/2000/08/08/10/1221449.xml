        <p>Like a generation of baby boomers celebrating their 50th birthdays, the Ladies Professional Golf Association has taken a hard look in the mirror and, for the most part, likes the image it sees.</p>
        <p>It is bigger than ever, financially strong, still attractive to sponsors and the object of unprecedented exposure in the news media. Total prize money grew from $17.1 million in 1990 to more than $36.2 million in 1999.</p>

        <p>Like a generation of baby boomers celebrating their 50th birthdays, the Ladies Professional Golf Association has taken a hard look in the mirror and, for the most part, likes the image it sees.</p>
        <p>It is bigger than ever, financially strong, still attractive to sponsors and the object of unprecedented exposure in the news media. Total prize money grew from $17.1 million in 1990 to more than $36.2 million in 1999.</p>
        <p>At the same time, tour events rose from 38 to 43 and televised coverage increased from 15 events in 1990 to 35 in 1999.</p>
        <p>''We're on television more than 250 hours; that's more than any other women's pro sport,'' said Ty Votaw, the L.P.G.A. commissioner. ''Week in and week out, we have 43 events where sponsors can put their money. And we feel good about the fact that all of these things are a result of our improvement in the 1990's.''</p>
        <p>But some tour players and officials say they still can't get people to look at them fairly, or look at them at all.</p>
        <p>The tour has been eclipsed by younger, trendier women's sports organizations, by popular teams like the American World Cup soccer champions, and it continues to suffer in comparison with the men's tour, and in particular, with Tiger Woods.</p>
        <p>''I think we're still in the shadow of the men,'' said Karrie Webb, who has been so dominant the last two seasons that she has been likened to Woods. ''It doesn't matter what tournament it is, in comparison to the men: they are always the first talked about on the news.''</p>
        <p>That was the case last month, when the Women's United States Open in Libertyville, Ill. -- won by Webb -- received cursory mention in the news media, while Woods's triumph at the British Open in St. Andrews, Scotland, led every sportscast and even some news reports.</p>
        <p>Today, the L.P.G.A.'s fourth and last major tournament of the year, the du Maurier Classic, begins in Aylmer, Quebec. But once again golf fans may be too busy watching Woods play the Buick Open in Grand Blanc, Mich., to notice, even though Webb could win a $1 million bonus from the Nabisco Challenge if she successfully defends her 1999 title.</p>
        <p>''I think because there are so many male reporters that they automatically do the comparisons, but you really can't compare,'' said Joanne Carner, still playing and making cuts at age 61. ''If I set my ball down next to Tiger, Tiger would hit a wedge. Or take David Duval, who's a shorter hitter. He might hit a 9-iron and even in my prime, I'm hitting a 5-iron from the same distance. The men are stronger, so we can't compare, distance-wise.''</p>
        <p>Although sometimes defensive about the L.P.G.A., Votaw is also frank about its problems. While prize money on the tour is high, it pales in comparison with the men's tour. The PGA's 49 events offer $157 million in prize money, while the PGA's Senior Tour has 39 events with $50 million in prize money.</p>
        <p>Of more immediate concern is the loss of sponsorship for this week's tournament in Canada.</p>
        <p>Under a Canadian law passed three years ago that takes effect next year, tobacco companies are prohibited from sponsoring sports events. Imperial Tobacco, sponsor of the du Maurier Classic, will end its relationship with the women's tour after this week. The L.P.G.A. must now decide whether its wants, or needs, a fourth major.</p>
        <p>Several top players have expressed support for designating the British Open as the fourth major, while others say the tour can be successful with only three. Some players say the tour might be better off having fewer events than the current 43, which would allow for more breaks in the schedule.</p>
        <p>Whatever happens, Votaw insists he is not overly concerned. The tour not only has its share of major sponsors like Nabisco, McDonald's, Oldsmobile and State Farm Insurance, but it also has a growing number of smaller sponsors that have eagerly signed on, including Century 21, Snackwell, Electrolux, Bearcom and Multi-Grain Cheerios.</p>
        <p>''We don't take things for granted,'' said Juli Inkster, one of the L.P.G.A.'s top players. ''We know we have to work very hard to keep sponsors happy and to keep proving ourselves to the public. I don't think any of the girls take it for granted. Every week, we go out and promote the L.P.G.A. as best we can.''</p>
        <p>As the longest running and oldest women's sports association, the L.P.G.A. has been a pioneer and leader in the struggle to gain equal opportunities for female athletes.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1950 by 12 female golfers -- including the legendary Babe Didrikson Zaharias, Louise Suggs and Patty Berg -- the L.P.G.A. started with a 14-event schedule and $50,000 in prize money.</p>
        <p>It was the first professional sports league entirely run by players and has been the model for other women's pro leagues to pattern themselves.</p>
        <p>When the players union of the Women's National Basketball Association wanted a pension plan in its first contract, it cited the precedent set by the L.P.G.A.</p>
        <p>The success of the L.P.G.A.'s decades-old child-care program served as an impetus for the United States Women's national soccer team, which negotiated nanny care for its players' children while training for the 1999 World Cup.</p>
        <p>Although the Women's Tennis Association has been called the vanguard of sports feminism, the L.P.G.A. started the revolution, making policy decisions that defied the times. In its inaugural year, for example, the L.P.G.A. voted not to include a ''Caucasian only'' policy in its membership regulations.</p>
        <p>''We ran tournaments, set up the golf courses, made pairings and signed the checks,'' said Carner, a member of the L.P.G.A. Hall of Fame. ''We were the first to install a pension plan for individual players. We were the first to put together a day-care program for members. We did it all. There were no officials. We did the officiating.''</p>
        <p>But with the emergence of other women's pro leagues, the L.P.G.A. has had to devise innovative ways to market its players to capture the public's attention on a crowded sports landscape.</p>
        <p>That task falls to Votaw, the fifth in a succession of all-male L.P.G.A. commissioners and the only one hired from within.</p>
        <p>At 38, he exudes a boyish enthusiasm and seems to be made for the job. He joined the L.P.G.A. in 1991 and has served as general counsel, special assistant to the commissioner and vice president of business affairs. He is highly visible at most tour events, socializing with sponsors, mingling with players and working the media tent to spread the gospel of women's golf.</p>
        <p>Although it has some very talented players in Webb, Annika Sorenstam, Inkster and Se Ri Pak, and up-and-coming players such as Kelli Kuehne and Grace Park, some players say the tour has not been able to match the men's tour in promoting its stars. Votaw hopes to change that perception.</p>
        <p>''I have some of the most approachable, accessible, good-looking, intelligent, funny athletes out there,'' Votaw said.</p>
        <p>Votaw also said the rise of international players -- by 1999, the tour had 85 players from 19 countries other than the United States -- has helped the L.P.G.A. expand its revenue potential overseas.</p>
        <p>He noted, for example, that five years ago, international capital made up 25 percent of the tour's television revenues. This year, it will be above 50 percent.</p>
        <p>''In Korea, Australia and Sweden there is a demand to have our product because their native daughters are being successful over here,'' Votaw said.</p>
        <p>Votaw would like to see golf do more to attract blacks to the game. ''It's rather ironic that there are more black players in the National Hockey League than in pro golf,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He would also like to see the L.P.G.A. play a larger role in helping to combat the discrimination many women face at golf clubs, a fact he believes is hurting the tour's ability to sell the sport to younger female fans. He also supports the idea of a senior tour for women.</p>
        <p>Votaw said the L.P.G.A. has withstood the test of time on its own terms. It does not have a men's pro league behind it, like the W.N.B.A. It does not have the benefit of having its four major championships played alongside the men, like the women's tennis tour does.</p>
        <p>''One of the things I've learned is that women's sports is a marathon, not a sprint,'' Votaw said. ''If you're hot one moment, you're going to get cold. If you're cold, you're going to get hot. And if it is a marathon and not a sprint, no one has run longer, faster or better than we have in terms of longevity and stand-alone success.''</p>
