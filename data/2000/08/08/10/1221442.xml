        <p>THEY don't sell consumer goods. Although they are financial institutions, they don't have street-level branches, tellers or A.T.M.'s. Many people have no idea what they do, and few people will ever interact directly with one.</p>
        <p>So just how do you advertise an investment bank?</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the answer was simple: with ''tombstones,'' the somber boxes in the financial press that announce this big deal or that, complete or in the works. But that was before the Internet economy and its lucrative initial public offerings changed everything, inspiring heightened competition among the players in a once buttoned-down industry. Nowadays, extensive display and broadcast ad campaigns have become the norm.</p>
        <p>The latest to join the fray: Robertson Stephens, the San Francisco-based investment banking arm of the FleetBoston Financial Corporation. In an industry dominated by old-line giants like Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, it is determined to make its mark. Or, at the very least, to carve out its niche.</p>
        <p>The company was founded in 1978, not far from Silicon Valley and at about the same time that the high-technology industry there began to blossom. (It was acquired by FleetBoston's predecessor, the BankBoston Corporation, in 1998.) Lately, its revenues have risen sharply, from $360 million in 1998 to $970 million last year to ''nearly a billion'' so far this year, according to Allen Olivo, its chief marketing officer. Because Robertson Stephens has specialized for years in bringing technology companies to market, with clients like the E*Trade Group, the online investment firm, it is, he said, ''the first investment bank to focus on the new economy.''</p>
        <p>But how can that translate into an advantage over bigger Wall Street-based Johnny-come-latelies? The idea is to build brand, said Mr. Olivo, who has been involved in branding before with companies like Amazon .com and Apple Computer, where he was senior director for marketing communications during the ''Think Different'' days of the late 1990's. Robertson Stephens was in Silicon Valley, literally and figuratively, before anyone else, he said, and because of that has ''knowledge that gives us a unique perspective in a global growth economy.''</p>
        <p>Hence an unconventional new campaign devised by Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., that breaks today in The New York Times and other newspapers. ''Thanks, old economy,'' proclaim the double-page spreads, words floating on an otherwise blank background. ''We'll take it from here.''</p>
        <p>The ad is intended to ''say something, but quietly,'' said the account director, Trish Adams, and to stress that Robertson Stephens's ''culture is a little different from other investment banks.'' Future print ads, also featuring one-line statements will follow, she said, in publications like The Wall Street Journal, Industry Standard and Fast Company. And, like today's example, they will feature one-line statements -- ''headlines,'' Ms. Adams called them -- that will be more like philosophical statements than hard-sell slogans.</p>
        <p>The 30-second Robertson Stephens television spots -- all of them apparently filmed in double or triple time -- also aim to be unconventional in their message, she said, without delving too far into the substance of what, exactly, an investment bank does. In one of them, for example, an off-camera announcer muses about America's westward migration and the fact that there is ''still so much more to be done.'' ''It's not time to settle down,'' he intones as a freighter scoots by the Golden Gate Bridge, waves lapping nearby and San Francisco's skyline barely visible in the distance. ''It never is.''</p>
        <p>In another spot, the same voice asks if ''you really think that all the technology in the world can erase economic truths that have held for hundreds of years?'' And as clouds speed over the tops of buildings in San Francisco's financial district, shot from a camera looking up at times at nearly a 90-degree angle, he answers the question himself: ''So do we. Ladies and gentlemen, this time it's different.''</p>
        <p>The commercials will run primarily on Bloomberg television, CNBC and CNNfn, Ms. Adams said, beginning this week and continuing through at least the end of the year. And the lack of substance in them and in print is deliberate, she said; for now, the idea is to say ''who they are and what they stand for,'' with respect to Robertson Stephens. Advertising with ''more content will be rotated in later,'' Ms. Adams said.</p>
        <p>Neither she nor Mr. Olivo would disclose the size of the Robertson Stephens effort, although the trade press put the figure at $25 million when Wieden &amp; Kennedy was awarded the account back in May. And while Mr. Olivo hopes that the campaign will result in increased business for the firm, that will be only one of the benchmarks by which its success will be gauged, he said. There are other more intangible measures as well.</p>
        <p>''Our target is multifaceted,'' he said, involving, among other things, ''recruiting, as we grow in size, and geographically,'' as well as ''getting better known by the public'' and wielding ''greater influence in the general conversation about the industry.''</p>
        <p>''We don't want to be the next Goldman, Sachs or Morgan Stanley,'' Mr. Olivo said. ''We're just trying to become the most influential investment bank in the new economy.''</p>
