        <p>It's not easy being in prison when your nickname is The Toy Store Bandit. It might make you want to fight.</p>
        <p>And fight Michael Bennett did.</p>
        <p>Bennett, beginning what would be a seven-year sentence for robbing a Toys 'R Us after-hours, won the first boxing tournament he entered inside Menard Federal Prison in Illinois.</p>
        <p>He kept fighting -- not to avoid being teased, but because he was good at it.</p>
        <p>Bennett was released from prison in 1998, and a little more than a year later he became the reigning amateur world heavyweight champion.</p>
        <p>Next month at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, he has a good chance at becoming the first American heavyweight fighter to win a gold medal in a dozen years.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of amazing, I know,'' Bennett said Tuesday, pulling down on the bill of his baseball cap as if to shade the smile that creased his face. ''It just teaches you that a life can take a lot of turns. That, I know.''</p>
        <p>Among the turning points for Bennett was the day he was transported to the Menard penitentiary, Dec. 10, 1993. It was his mother's birthday.</p>
        <p>''Not a very good birthday present,'' Bennett said.</p>
        <p>Though he was a first-time offender -- another charge for robbing a McDonald's had been dismissed -- Bennett received a sentence of 26 years.</p>
        <p>''I remember my mother in the back of the court just weeping and weeping,'' Bennett said. ''And I heard some lady way in the back go, 'Damn, that's a lot of time.' ''</p>
        <p>When he arrived at Menard -- nicknamed the Pit -- the sun was setting.</p>
        <p>''It was dusk and the sky was a deathly orange turning to black,'' Bennett said. ''It was like something out of an Alfred Hitchcock movie. There's this massive, dark, dingy place built out of a rock quarry.</p>
        <p>''I said to myself: 'Oh, my God. What have I got myself into?' You just start doing a lot of praying and promising. You know: 'God help me and I'll do this. Get me out of here and I'll do that.' ''</p>
        <p>In 1991, Bennett was a linebacker at North Park College in his native Chicago and had recently been voted the team's most valuable defensive player when he went home for the summer after his freshman year.</p>
        <p>At North Park, he was studying criminology. ''You tell people that and they laugh,'' Bennett said Tuesday at a reception for United the States Olympic Boxing team at the New York Athletic Club. ''It's not funny, but it's ironic.''</p>
        <p>Bennett started hanging out with an old high school acquaintance that summer.</p>
        <p>''This so-called friend talked me into this scheme and I listened,'' Bennett said. ''We've all had these guys in our life. My mother told me not to hang around with him. Said he was trouble. I didn't listen. It was a stupid mistake. A big one.''</p>
        <p>Bennett said when his accomplice was arrested for the robbery, he turned Bennett into police.</p>
        <p>''My co-defendant cooperated and got six years,'' Bennett said. ''I didn't cooperate and got 26 years.'' On appeal, the sentence was reduced to 15 years.</p>
        <p>''People always say to me: 'Wait a minute. First time offenders don't go to the penitentiary,' '' Bennett said. ''But they're wrong. Trust me, there are a lot of men in there who hadn't done crimes before. It's like I tell the kids groups I talk to now. One big, misjudgment can put you in the place.''</p>
        <p>As Bennett bounced around the Illinois correctional system, from Menard to Danville to Galesburg, he kept boxing. He was tutored by three other inmates -- all serving life sentences -- who had fighting experience. Bennett knew them only as Pharaoh, Mongoose and Papasan. When Bennett was paroled July 28, 1998, he left as the unofficial interprison system heavyweight champion.</p>
        <p>''I remember they got 20 of us who were about to be paroled together in this room,'' Bennett said. ''And they said: 'You're all psyched to get out of here. To get your freedom, to go get a good meal, to go see your woman.' But 17 of you will be back.'</p>
        <p>''Everybody's going, 'Not me.' I remember thinking: 'No way. You got what you got out of me and no more.' ''</p>
        <p>Bennett went to work for a delivery service and walked into the gym near home, the Chicago Park District Garfield Park Fieldhouse, where George Hernandez trained boxers. ''I knew I had someone special, someone very determined,'' Hernandez said. ''He fights like he has no tomorrow. I encourage that. It comes from his background. He fights like he has to, to keep a second chance alive.''</p>
        <p>If he wanted to get Bennett into the Olympic trials in less than two years, Hernandez knew he had little time.</p>
        <p>''We skipped entering him in the novice division, even though what he learned in prison was a different kind of boxing,'' Hernandez said. ''We had to teach him about the more technical styles of amateur and international boxing.''</p>
        <p>Bennett, who is 6 feet and 201 pounds, won a Golden Gloves title and others along the way in 1999. There were setbacks, but few given his inexperience. Consider that this year's American superheavyweight Olympian, Calvin Brock, lost his first six amateur fights.</p>
        <p>Bennett, with no time to spare, advanced quickly and in the 1999 world championships, won his first three fights to earn a place in the finals against the two-time defending Olympic champion and six-time world champion, Felix Savon of Cuba.</p>
        <p>Savon, in protest of an earlier controversial decision against another Cuban boxer, refused to fight and Bennett was the world champion in a walkover.</p>
        <p>''I wanted my shot at him,'' Bennett said of Savon, who remains the clear Olympic heavyweight favorite. ''But maybe it sets up a bigger showdown. We all know it. In Sydney, it's about trying to knock the longtime king of the hill off the mountain.''</p>
        <p>Bennett recently sprained an ankle and will not fight this weekend in a United States Olympic boxing tune-up competition in Connecticut with the Puerto Rican team. He expects to resume training next week and he is healthy otherwise. Once a strict vegetarian, he has recently added eggs and fish to his diet, something he believes has added to his stamina.</p>
        <p>Endurance could matter. Against Savon, the 29-year-old Bennett will be something he seldom is: the younger fighter -- by four years. Or as someone told Bennett, he was beginning high school when Savon was winning his first world championship.</p>
        <p>''We all take different paths,'' Bennett said. ''I didn't stay on the path and I let a lot of people down. But a lot of those people are proud of me now. I don't have ill will toward the system or anybody. It was my lack of judgment. I accept that. I can look forward from here.''</p>
        <p>There is certainly a professional career in Bennett's post-Olympics future. As he said, ''Why not provide for my family and do something I love to do?''</p>
        <p>For now, Michael Bennett is trying to contain his excitement about the Sydney Games.</p>
        <p>''I've really got to be patient and wait,'' he said. ''You'd think I would have learned that.''</p>
