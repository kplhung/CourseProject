        <p>Perhaps it was a marriage too good to last: a struggling Episcopal parish and an exuberant performing arts center, bound together to restore and protect an endangered Gothic Revival church in the heart of Brooklyn Heights.</p>
        <p>Now, with the relationship between the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity and the center based there, Arts at St. Ann's, headed for the rocks after 21 years, some say that it was a miracle that the two stayed together as long as they did.</p>
        <p>By the end of this summer, absent an unforeseen intervention, Arts at St. Ann's  will have left the church for good. At this point it may be impossible for the struggling organization to present a fall program, said Susan Feldman, the artistic director.</p>
        <p>The trauma of the breakup, over issues concerning the relationship between the church and the arts center, has caused an unusual group to reflect on its purpose and evolution.</p>
        <p>''Whereas we started filling a niche in Brooklyn, we ended up filling a niche in an artistic community that was international,'' Ms. Feldman said. ''Our niche evolved, and now we are going to find out what it really is.''</p>
        <p>The collaboration between the church and the arts center began in 1979 as a model of harmonious coexistence. The church, a historical and architectural landmark built in 1847, needed help raising money for the restoration of its building and, above all, of its magnificent stained-glass figural windows, the first of their kind in the country. The parish was seeking to enhance its profile in the community and obtain public grants.</p>
        <p>Enter Ms. Feldman, then 30 and an assistant theater director, who became a consultant to the church's preservation project. ''I see arts groups in Brooklyn looking for space, I see musicians who love playing here, I see the Landmarks Conservancy, which has a national mission to save the church, '' she recalled.</p>
        <p>For a long time, the church and the arts center worked together, backed by the Landmarks Conservancy. All told, they were able to raise more than $4 million in public grants and private donations to restore all but 10 of the 64 stained-glass windows, and to fix the church's exterior and an iron fence. But Arts at St. Ann's quickly took on a life of its own.</p>
        <p>''It became a showcase of Brooklyn, rather than for Brooklyn,'' said Kenneth K. Fisher, a Democratic city councilman from Brooklyn Heights, and a center supporter.</p>
        <p>''It brought in a lot of people who otherwise might not have ventured into Brooklyn.''</p>
        <p>When it started, Arts at St. Ann's emphasized classical music and local theater. The Brooklyn Opera Society, the Brooklyn Philharmonia Chorus and the New Cycle Theater were there for the opening season in 1980; the following year, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center chose St. Ann's as a site for preseason previews. A seven-year-run of Bach Cantata Sundays followed.</p>
        <p>By the mid-1980's, the emphasis began to move away from classical music as the music's audience shifted to the concerts on the Barge on the nearby East River waterfront. According to a survey done by the arts center, its audiences were multiethnic and far-flung: only 47 percent came from Brooklyn, and 35 percent from Manhattan.</p>
        <p>More and more, Arts at St. Ann's developed into what Ms. Feldman called an artist-driven program and an eclectic blend of music, genres and styles. ''A lot of organizations don't want to be in on the beginning of things.'' Ms. Feldman said, ''but that's what we did.''</p>
        <p>The first experiment was to combine performances of the Bach Cantatas and the Bread and Puppet Theater, a troupe of puppeteers from Vermont known for their highly political presentations.</p>
        <p>The unsual mix created a stir. ''It got kind of wild,'' Ms. Feldman recalled. The puppet theater was ''very political,'' she added, ''so the biggest controversy was whether you were destroying the Bach by putting police sirens in the performance.''</p>
        <p>Soon there were giant puppets performing ''The Barber of Seville''; a ''Not 1984 Film Festival'' (in 1984), showing films that included ''Hiroshima Mon Amour'' and ''The Mouse that Roared''; and ''2 Disarming Evenings,'' in support of the nuclear disarmament movement. In 1989 Marianne Faithfull performed in the Brecht-Weill opera ''Seven Deadly Sins,'' and John Cale and Lou Reed collaborated in a tribute to Andy Warhol, ''Songs for 'Drella.''</p>
        <p>Artists, musicians and theater troupes came from Houston, Philadelphia and beyond. In 1988 St. Ann's was the host for ''Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares,'' a performance by a women's choir from Bulgarian state radio and television.</p>
        <p>''St. Ann's was a venue for artists who would sometimes fall between the cracks, who might not be rock-and-roll club artists, and not concert hall artists, which makes them alternative, whatever,'' said the musician David Byrne, who presented ''The Forest,'' his first major work for orchestra, there. ''For some artists, playing there meant they could exercise their creative freedom, do something a little out of the ordinary.''</p>
        <p>The physical space of the church was a special attraction for Mr. Byrne. ''It was a very cool space,'' he said. ''It added another layer to the experience, having your music presented in something that wasn't an anonymous white box.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrne is not the only artist and performer transported by the spider-vaulted ceiling, Gothic arches and many-colored windows. But therein lay a festering dispute. For the Episcopal church -- in particular, the last two rectors at St. Ann and the Holy Trinity and the Rev. Orris G. Walker, bishop of Long Island -- the church is not a space: It is a church.</p>
        <p>''It has been a very, very difficult situation for many years,'' said the Rev. Joade Dauer-Cardasis, who was appointed rector of the church last year. ''People keep forgetting that this is an Episcopal church, that this is a sacred institution, not a secular institution.''</p>
        <p>There had been trouble several years earlier, when a previous rector tried to evict the program. That effort failed, but the bitterness lingered. Then, last winter, communications between the rectory and the arts center broke down over the church's proposal to redefine the relationship and put it on more traditional landlord-tenant terms.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dauer-Cardasis insisted that her problems had nothing to do with the arts center's programs, which were staged in the church and its parish hall next door. ''There was never a breath of discussion about content, not at all,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Feldman, the church's proposal amounted to a repudiation of the concept of partnership. For Ms. Dauer-Cardasis, a redefinition of the relationship in a letter of agreement was long overdue. ''This letter of agreement was something that should have been done 15 years ago,'' she said, noting that both the Episcopal Church's canon law and state law set specific requirements for secular tenants on church property.</p>
        <p>''The arts center got a lot of authority and responsibility over the years that was inappropriate,'' she said. ''There are people who felt that the arts center was a ministry of this church, which it was not. ''</p>
        <p>To onlookers the breakdown is sad. ''The partnership was done for a very good reason, and I find it very sad that for all the work, it comes to this,'' said John Stubbs, vice president of the World Monument Fund, a nonprofit private preservation group. ''There was a system for raising money, for using the building, doing the work, all of it favored by the community. All that was needed now was more time and more work.''</p>
        <p>Arts at St. Ann's is now operating from a 29th-floor office in a nearby building and looking for new quarters.</p>
        <p>''Somebody said we should be called Arts at St. Ann in Exile,'' Ms. Feldman said. ''I say we should call ourselves Arts at St. Ann's All Over the Map.''</p>
