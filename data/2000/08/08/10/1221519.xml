        <p>Several news media concerns have sued GoSMS.com, a Web site based in Israel that sends subscribers headlines via cell phone, saying that much of the content offered by the company is being taken without permission from their Web sites. Among the plaintiffs in the suit filed in Federal District Court in New York six weeks ago were the CNN unit of Time Warner Inc., the Washington Post Company, Gannett Inc. and The New York Times Company. Bruce Keller, a lawyer for the media companies, said yesterday, ''There is no legitimate argument to the wholesale copying of content from The New York Times Web site and the Web sites of other major media organizations, particularly when those companies license that content to competitors of companies like GoSMS.'' Yuval Golan, chief executive of GoSMS, could not be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
