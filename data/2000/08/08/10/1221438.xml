        <p>Editorial urges Asian-American leaders to encourage public dialogue on AIDS and acceptance of disease to spur prevention and early treatment</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Recent studies show that Asian-Americans, especially new immigrants, are largely uneducated about AIDS. More than any other ethnic group, Asian-Americans do not get diagnosed with AIDS until the disease is already in its later stages. This reflects a dearth of Asian-language educational materials. Conservative cultural beliefs also hamper open discussions about AIDS. Stepping up AIDS education efforts would help increase understanding. But the most influence lies with community leaders, who can encourage public dialogue on AIDS and acceptance of the disease.</p>
        <p>So far, community groups have been leading AIDS education efforts. These organizations have received state and federal funding, but they need more assistance. Organizations have to provide educational materials in languages ranging from Punjabi to Mandarin. But more important, they must focus on cultural differences. A Japanese group may react very differently to AIDS education than a Korean one would.</p>

        <p>Even improvements in AIDS education will not be enough if the community's silence on the disease persists. Unfortunately, many influential religious leaders have refused to allow AIDS education into their places of worship. It is encouraging that the Chinese-American Planning Council has begun an AIDS education program for prostitutes in New York City's Chinatown. Public health agencies must also do more. But leaders and organizations, which can reach their communities through a common language and culture, will have the most effect.</p>
