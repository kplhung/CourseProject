      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>After two years of poor results, Reed Elsevier, the British-Dutch publisher that owns Lexis-Nexis and Variety, said it would meet its full-year earnings forecasts after a fall in first-half profits was lower than expected. The company is investing in online ventures as it pursues efforts to reduce costs. It said Internet spending had reduced first-half adjusted pretax profit to $:351 million ($529 million) from $:371 million a year earlier. Analysts had forecast profits of $:324 million to $:340 million. Reed Elsevier also said it was considering making an offer for Harcourt General, a textbook publisher, which was put up for sale in June.</p>
