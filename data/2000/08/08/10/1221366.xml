        <p>Will Unit 26 do better than other Web sites selling contemporary designs for the home? The jury's out, but the new London-based company's site is as sleek as its products, by established and emerging artists and designers. Shown here are a blown Murano glass vase by Amy Cushing (26 inches high, $643) and a wenge-veneered birch screen by Andrew Tye (six feet high, $2,820). The site, promoted  as ''The New Art Democracy,'' was founded by Anil Malhotra, a businessman who liked art but found the conventional art world intimidating. At www.unit26.com.</p>
