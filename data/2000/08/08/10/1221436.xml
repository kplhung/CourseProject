        <p>After enduring months of withering criticism of its safety and financial practices, Consolidated Edison announced today that it would replace the steam generators before reopening the troubled Indian Point 2 nuclear plant.</p>
        <p>Indian Point 2 has been closed since February, when a cracked tube in one of the steam generators caused a radioactive leak, the worst accident in the plant's 26-year history. Now, as a result of Con Ed's decision to replace all four generators, the plant will be out of service until the end of the year. The decision all but guarantees a continued scramble for electricity from other sources in a year in which rates have escalated because of power shortages throughout the Northeast.</p>
        <p>The decision, which comes a day after Gov. George E. Pataki signed a bill that orders the company to repay customers more than $100 million in costs associated with the accident, represents an abrupt about-face for Con Edison. Until now, the company had resisted requests from residents, government officials and environmental groups to replace the generators. Critics had argued that structural weaknesses in the plant's aging equipment should have been detected as early as 1997.</p>
        <p>As recently as late last week, Con Edison seemed determined to restart the power plant with its existing four generators, and had asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for permission to conduct additional heat and pressure tests, said Neil Sheehan, an N.R.C. spokesman.</p>
        <p>But on Monday, Governor Pataki signed the bill requiring Con Edison to repay customers more than $100 million and prohibiting the utility from collecting tens of millions more until the plant reopens. And while Con Edison officials vowed today to fight that legislation in court, they also decided to abandon the idea of relying on existing equipment to restart the plant, which is situated in this Westchester County town 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Stephen Quinn, a Con Ed vice president who once managed the plant, said that there was ''no connection'' between the legislation and today's decision, and that the utility had acted at the earliest possible juncture to go ahead with replacement.</p>
        <p>''We are proceeding with replacement as fast as we could have,'' Mr. Quinn said. ''We are talking about bringing in 700 craftsmen, approximately, to effect this repair. These people are not just sitting at home waiting for you to give them a call. And then we have to get machines, and we have to get tools, and we have to do testing.''</p>
        <p>But public officials and critics of the company expressed doubts that the legislation and today's decision were entirely unrelated.</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki, through a spokesman, said that the legislation ''provided the push that Con Ed needed to move forward.'' Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, issued a statement saying that ''we appreciate the fact that Con Edison has heeded our call.''</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, the Westchester Democrat who has relentlessly criticized Con Ed, was particularly outspoken.''Once we found a way to successfully threaten their pocketbook, they responded to issues of public safety,'' Mr. Brodsky said.''</p>
        <p>Indian Point has been under intense scrutiny since the Feb. 15 accident, when a corroded tube in one steam generator cracked, allowing radioactive water to mix with clean water. There were no injuries, and Con Ed said the amount of radiation released was too small to be measured, but the plant has been closed since then for analysis and repairs.</p>
        <p>In March, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission accused both its own staff and Con Edison of mishandling a 1997 inspection of the plant, saying that a ''a more thorough operational assessment would have predicted an increased probability of tube leakage or rupture.'' Then, in July, the agency rejected Con Edison's request to reopen Indian Point 2 with the existing generators.</p>
        <p>The rejection was particularly noteworthy because Con Edison had hoped to restart the generators to increase the company's power reserves during the steamy summer months, when energy use spikes.</p>
        <p>Work will begin shortly to empty the fuel from the reactor and move the four generators, each of which is 63 feet high and around 305 tons, out of the containment building. Work crews will then slide the new generators into the containment building.</p>
        <p>Con Ed and several other utilities had long ago sued the generators' manufacturer, Westinghouse, and won, forcing Westinghouse to provide replacement generators. The other plaintiffs installed them, but Con Ed decided that it would be cheaper to make do with the original, defective ones.</p>
        <p>The task should be completed by year's end, Mr. Quinn said. The cost was estimated at $135 million.</p>
        <p>It is hard to gauge how these developments will affect the pending sale of Indian Point 2. The market for electric power plants at a time of limited supply is a robust one, as evidenced by the $1.3 billion paid on Monday for the two reactors at Millstone Point near New London, Conn.</p>
        <p>Regardless, the replacement work should have no impact on the legislation Governor Pataki signed on Tuesday, or on Con Edison's plans to file papers next week to block that legislation, Mr. Quinn said. Nor will the work be affected by a separate complaint filed with the Public Service Commission by Mr. Brodsky and Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat of the Bronx, who seek to disallow fuel charges Con Edison incurred over the last decade or so related to the cost of servicing the old generators.</p>
        <p>If the complaint is approved by the commission, then Con Edison could be liable for another $100 million in rebates, Mr. Brodsky said. But even if the commission does not approve the complaint, environmentalists contend that Con Edison's reputation has been bruised.</p>
