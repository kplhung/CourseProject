        <p>Former Yale University chaplain William Sloane Coffin Op-Ed article recalls Sen Joseph Lieberman's support for civil rights movement as Yale newspaper editor; notes neither Gov George W Bush nor Dick Cheney were among minority of Yale students who shared in action and passion of era</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>College life in the 1950's was once described as the bland leading the bland. Certainly on every campus there were professors with disquieting thoughts and more than a handful of students who worried about the world's future as much as their own. But most students in the 50's considered their education more for gain than for growth.</p>
        <p>Then came the 60's. At Yale, where I served as chaplain and where three of this year's presidential and vice presidential candidates were students (Joseph Lieberman arrived in 1960 and George W. Bush in 1964, and Dick Cheney was there briefly early on), a strong social consciousness was emerging. The 1955 bus boycott by blacks in Montgomery, Ala., had put that city on the moral map, and in 1960 I invited the movement's leader, Martin Luther King Jr., to speak in the Yale chapel. The church was packed. King emphasized social, not personal, morality. Quoting Paul Tillich, he declared, ''Since the law cannot be wholly internalized in the conscience of imperfect human beings, conscience must be externalized into law.''</p>

        <p>College life in the 1950's was once described as the bland leading the bland. Certainly on every campus there were professors with disquieting thoughts and more than a handful of students who worried about the world's future as much as their own. But most students in the 50's considered their education more for gain than for growth.</p>
        <p>Then came the 60's. At Yale, where I served as chaplain and where three of this year's presidential and vice presidential candidates were students (Joseph Lieberman arrived in 1960 and George W. Bush in 1964, and Dick Cheney was there briefly early on), a strong social consciousness was emerging. The 1955 bus boycott by blacks in Montgomery, Ala., had put that city on the moral map, and in 1960 I invited the movement's leader, Martin Luther King Jr., to speak in the Yale chapel. The church was packed. King emphasized social, not personal, morality. Quoting Paul Tillich, he declared, ''Since the law cannot be wholly internalized in the conscience of imperfect human beings, conscience must be externalized into law.''</p>
        <p>A lot of students were still hanging around my house when I returned from taking King to the railroad station. Said one, ''That man makes us blacks proud to be black,'' to which a Southern white quickly added, ''and us whites proud to be human beings.''</p>
        <p>Early in the 60's Yale students and a few faculty and chaplains helped integrate buses, motels, lunch counters, parks, pools and housing in New Haven. In the summer of '64, many students joined voter registration drives in Alabama and Mississippi. Urging them on was the editor of The Yale Daily News, Joe Lieberman, who in October 1963 was himself a civil rights worker in Mississippi.</p>
        <p>I thought highly and was very fond of Joe. For him Judaism represented a world view undergirding progressive thought and action. It was a view widely shared by many religious groups at Yale. His being a Jew and editor of The News was less a breakthrough than a validation of the fact that anti-Semitism was receding.</p>
        <p>In the early 1960's, the Peace Corps attracted many Yale students. Students began seeking careers reflecting John Ruskin's thought that the primary reward for human toil is not what you get for it but what you become by it. The college became far more diverse: many more Jews, African-Americans and foreign students were admitted, and finally in 1969 Yale became co-ed. Fraternities lost popularity as many students agreed with E. B. White that ''the opposite of fraternities is fraternity.'' Teach-ins and demonstrations opposing the Vietnam War were jammed -- addressed by John Hersey and Arthur Miller, among others. On Oct. 16, 1967, draft cards were turned in around the country in protest and then handed over to the Justice Department in Washington. The largest number from any one college came from Yale.</p>
        <p>I am sorry to say that during these years I knew only Mr. Lieberman, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Cheney. It is also important to note that in all these activities only a minority played active roles. But a prophetic minority always has more to say than any majority, ''moral'' or ''silent.''</p>
        <p>I am sure Governor Bush is right in criticizing the self-righteousness of many of us in the antiwar movement at Yale. It is hard to fight national self-righteousness without personal self-righteousness. But it is also sad not to share in the action and passion of your time. Often called a decade of student unrest, the 60's would be better termed a time of ethical unrest, a time that I hope will soon come again to disrupt our present complacency.</p>
