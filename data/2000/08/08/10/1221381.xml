        <p>SOME skeptics may believe a thing only when they see it in writing, but is the writing more believable when it is seen on paper rather than on a computer screen?</p>
        <p>Apparently it is, based on a recent study at Ohio State University. The study involved 131 Ohio State undergraduates and looked at differences in comprehension of something read on a printed page and the same thing on a computer screen, said Karen Murphy, assistant professor of educational psychology at Ohio State and co-author of the study.</p>
        <p>The students were divided into three groups and asked to read and answer questions on two magazine essays, one on school integration, the other on doctor-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients. One group  read the articles on paper and answered questions on paper, another  read the articles on a desktop computer and answered questions on paper, and the remaining group read the articles and answered the questions on a desktop computer.</p>
        <p>The articles had the same formats in print as they did on the computer screen, but the students who read the paper versions found the articles more interesting and persuasive than the students who read the articles on computers.</p>
        <p>The group that read the essay on doctor-assisted suicide, for example, gave the essay an average understandability rating of 7.76 (on a scale of 1 to 10). The group that read the same article and answered questions on the computer gave it an average understandability rating of 6.85, and the group that read it on the computer and answered questions on paper gave it an average understandability rating of 6.55.</p>
        <p>Dr. Murphy said the study brought  to light the effectiveness of using computers and the Internet in middle and high schools if students were not as able to understand material they read on a computer. What's more, she said, younger students with lower reading abilities might have more trouble comprehending material online than the college students in the study.</p>
        <p>''While it's true we can use online mediums to give students access to information they would never have had before, it raises the questions about how much they can comprehend from the texts,'' she said. ''Computers are put into schools to enhance learning, but if it's difficult for some students to comprehend online material, then the computer access isn't necessarily enhancing learning.''</p>
        <p>Although students can print articles they find online, some schools lack printers. ''Many of the urban schools we have been working with barely have decent computers and monitors, much less printers for the students to use,'' Dr. Murphy said.</p>
        <p>Michael Martin, a senior who participated in the study, said that, in general, he can comprehend both print and online articles to the same degree, but that he has to focus more when he reads articles online because he finds Web pages to be distracting. ''Most Web sites are designed to look fun,'' he said. ''There are all these great graphics, and it takes concentration to home in and focus on the actual information.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin often finds himself struggling to digest the information on a Web page before being lured away by links to other pages. And like others who use the Web as a research tool, he frequently makes printed copies to read later.</p>
        <p>Other students who do a lot of research on the Web print copies of  what they find because it is hard for them to read lengthy texts on the computer. ''Scrolling through 30 pages on the screen is not so comfy on the eyes,'' said Allison Boyle, a law student at the University of Maryland. ''It's a good scanning tool, but when it comes to using what I find, I print it out.''</p>
        <p>Printing portions of case law and other articles also lets Ms. Boyle make notes in margins and highlight paragraphs. ''You can't really do that on a computer screen,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Gregory Rawlins, a professor of computer science at Indiana University in Bloomington, said students have to work a little harder when they read articles on a computer screen because they don't have the same visual cues that they would have with a book or typed or written material. ''There might be a coffee stain or a fold in a page, supposedly incidental things, but they help the mind associate what's on the page with what is being read,'' he said. ''You might have the same information on a computer screen, but it's much harder to reconstruct the information that's there.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Murphy said the Ohio State study suggested that students may need to be better trained to absorb material from a computer screen. The fact that information found online often contains links to other pages is an example of how reading a Web page differs from the more linear nature of reading a paper page.</p>
        <p>''We're not really sure, but it may be that the skills students use when reading plain paper, such as linking what the text says to their prior knowledge, don't necessarily transfer online,'' she said. ''It may be a matter of teaching different types of strategies for processing information online.''</p>
