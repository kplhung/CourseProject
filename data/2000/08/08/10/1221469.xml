        <p>Nine  bellhops  all but one of them members of minorities -- who were fired from the trendy Mondrian hotel on the Sunset Strip in 1996 and replaced by whites will be paid $120,000 each under a settlement announced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission today.</p>
        <p>The commission had filed suit under the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  charging that the Mondrian's owner, Ian Schrager Hotels Inc., engaged in discriminatory recruitment practices against Hispanic, black and Asian job applicants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schrager, chairman and chief executive of the company, is perhaps best known as a co-owner of Studio 54  in New York. He also owns a number of fashionable hotels, including Morgans, Royalton and Paramount in New York, Sanderson and St. Martins Lane in London, and Delano in Miami.</p>
        <p>Rather than relying on typical hiring methods, the Schrager company is known for using a casting approach to filling hotel staff jobs, including the placement of advertisements in trade publications like Variety. The complaint brought by the employment opportunity commission noted that the advertisements sought out applicants who were ''high-energy, upbeat, handsome/ pretty with cool-looking individual style.''</p>
        <p>''The message,'' Peter Laura, a senior commission attorney in Los Angeles, said of the settlement today,  ''is if you're going to create this hip, cool staff and image, it should include minorities. Hip and cool is not just white.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Laura said the commission's investigation into the case had led among other things to a memo in which Mr. Schrager wrote that the busboys at the Mondrian were ''too ethnic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schrager said through spokesmen today that he had no comment beyond a statement issued by the hotel's general manager, David Weidlich.</p>
        <p>In that statement, Mr. Weidlich portrayed the firings as an unintentional consequence of a bustle that had followed Mr. Schrager's purchase of the long-bankrupt hotel in 1995 and a subsequent nine-month renovation.</p>
        <p>''We feel badly that these former employees were lost in the chaos of the reopening,'' the statement said, ''and that their discharge may not have been handled as sensitively as it could have been.''</p>
        <p>Pressed for details, the company had no further comment.</p>
        <p>Of the nine men dismissed, three were Filipino, two were Latino, two were Cambodian, one was African-American and one was white. They had all worked at the hotel for minimum wage plus tips, eight of them for at least seven years. The $120,000 that each receives will be paid over three years.</p>
        <p>One of the nine, Ben Ison, a Filipino who had worked there seven years, said that while he was pleased with the financial arrangement, the real goal had been to call attention to unfair hiring practices at the Mondrian, in hopes of protecting other workers. He said he thought this goal had been achieved.</p>
        <p>Another fired bellhop, Rich Brand, an aspiring actor, said he had been blindsided by the dismissal, having worked through the hotel's renovation, when tips were down along with  occupancy.</p>
        <p>''We were told to stay because things would be getting better,'' he said. Then, just a few weeks before Christmas, came the firings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brand said he hoped the settlement would send a message to employers. ''Someone like Ian Schrager is pretty well known,'' he said.  ''Hopefully, people will pay attention to what's going on.''</p>
        <p>Ida L. Castro, the commission's chairwoman, said, ''This settlement should remind employers in California and nationwide that employees and applicants must be judged strictly by their ability to do the job, rather than on non-job-related criteria such as their race or national origin -- as in this case.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weidlich, the Mondrian's general manager, noted in his statement that the manager who ran the hotel at the time of the firings was no longer there, and cited steps taken to ensure that ''this type of thing cannot happen again.''</p>
        <p>Those steps include adding a human resources director to oversee hiring and firing and help the hotel comply with fair employment programs. Mr. Laura, of the E.E.O.C.,  said the settlement required the hotel to report regularly to the commission on those practices.</p>
