        <p>Chad Carvin was a high-energy kid even before he started walking. At 8 months, he climbed atop the refrigerator, his mother said. By age 3, he was hang-gliding on the garage door. At 4, he had to be dragged off the roof.</p>
        <p>So, six months before the 1996 Olympic swimming trials, Carvin became alarmed when a sluggishness set into his body and would not leave. He struggled through training, felt tired all the time. His body seemed  like a dead battery that could not be recharged. Blood tests came back normal. No mononucleosis. Nothing. This scared him even more. In a much-publicized moment of despair, Carvin swallowed sleeping pills in an attempt to commit suicide.</p>

        <p>Chad Carvin was a high-energy kid even before he started walking. At 8 months, he climbed atop the refrigerator, his mother said. By age 3, he was hang-gliding on the garage door. At 4, he had to be dragged off the roof.</p>
        <p>So, six months before the 1996 Olympic swimming trials, Carvin became alarmed when a sluggishness set into his body and would not leave. He struggled through training, felt tired all the time. His body seemed  like a dead battery that could not be recharged. Blood tests came back normal. No mononucleosis. Nothing. This scared him even more. In a much-publicized moment of despair, Carvin swallowed sleeping pills in an attempt to commit suicide.</p>
        <p>He was taken to the medical center at the University of Arizona, where he was a student, and while he was being treated, doctors discovered the problem with fatigue was caused by a viral infection in his heart. The muscle had been pumping at about one-third of its capacity. A lack of blood flow meant a lack of oxygen. That was why he was so exhausted all the time.</p>
        <p>''When they diagnosed him, it was like a huge weight was lifted off his shoulders,'' Judie Carvin said of her son. ''We were alone in the room and I said, 'Chad, you seem happy.' Before, he had been desperate. He thought he was losing his mind. But he told me, 'I'm not crazy. They found out what it is. We'll let them fix it. It will be O.K.' ''</p>
        <p>This was December of 1995. The 1996 Olympic trials were in four months. There was no time to get in shape. The virus had to run its course. When the trials came around, Chad said he turned on the television once but could not watch. Four years later, fully recovered from heart problems and a subsequent back injury, Carvin finally made it to the Summer Games tonight, finishing second in the 400-meter freestyle at the 2000 Olympic trials. Klete Keller, 18, of Phoenix set an American record in 3 minutes 47.18 seconds while Carvin also swam under the previous American record in 3:47.50.</p>
        <p>No American has won a medal in the event since 1984, and Carvin, 26, will have only a slim chance at a bronze at the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. But it hardly seemed to matter tonight.</p>
        <p>''I'm so thrilled for him,'' Judie Carvin said of her son. ''It's my dream to see my son's dream come true.</p>
        <p>''I'm so excited he's going to the Olympics. Four and a half years ago, we were at a point where the Olympics didn't mean anything.''</p>
        <p>This moment must have seemed as if it would never come in December of 1995 when Carvin missed a practice at Arizona and was found in his apartment by his roommate, sleeping, unable to be shaken awake, having tried to kill himself.</p>
        <p>''I think he was reaching out,'' said Bill Rose, who has coached Carvin on and off for years in Mission Viejo, Calif. ''His whole life was in front of him. He didn't know what was going on. It got to him.''</p>
        <p>Carvin said: ''I felt like I had let everyone down, like I had let myself down. I wasn't sure how to deal with it. It turned into some kind of mental battle with all the tests saying I was O.K. and something inside telling me that something was wrong.''</p>
        <p>Placed on heart medication, he improved gradually as he slept up to 12 to 15 hours a day. His rest period, he calls it. By April of 1996, a month after the Olympic trials, Carvin began to feel like his old self again. He could not participate in the Atlanta Games, but at least he could resume his career. There would be another chance at the Olympics in four years. At the national spring championships in February of 1997, he won four events and later qualified for the 1998 world swimming championships in Perth, Australia. But just as his career resumed, it was interrupted again.</p>
        <p>Carvin took a bad fall in a skateboarding accident in the summer of 1997 and was left with two bulging disks in his back. For six months, he kept trying to swim, but neither his back nor his times seemed to improve. He had to withdraw from the world championships. Maybe it was time to quit altogether, he thought. He had done so much work to get back in shape and now there was no reward, only more frustration. He had just graduated from Arizona with a degree in finance. Maybe it was time to move into the real world.</p>
        <p>''It was really tough,'' Rose said. ''He thought, 'I've just licked all these problems. Not again.' '' In a way, Rose said he tricked Carvin into competing again, inviting him to swim as a way to keep in shape, and suggesting at the last minute that he enter an occasional meet. No pressure, just a chance to have fun.</p>
        <p>''My fitness came back real quick, and I started to think I had to see it all the way through 2000,'' Carvin said.</p>
        <p>One thing he had never lost was a thirst for competition. But the coach noticed a tentativeness in the way Carvin was training. He seemed to be holding back. Five months ago, Rose had a talk with him. ''If you want to go to the Olympics,'' the coach told the swimmer, ''you have to train harder.''</p>
        <p>''He was afraid to train hard, afraid that his heart might get sick or that something would break,'' Rose said.</p>
        <p>The talk seemed to liberate Carvin, who prepared ferociously for the trials, won his prelim this morning by two full seconds and held the lead tonight until the final 50 meters.</p>
        <p>''That's not important,'' Judie Carvin said. ''We're just happy he's got a chance to live a happy, normal life. We've been on a roller-coaster ride, falling to the bottom and sailing to the top. Now, we're going around a curve and just hanging on.''</p>
        <p>SPLASHES</p>
        <p>DARA TORRES, 33, set an American record of 57.58 seconds today in the 100-meter butterfly prelims. . . . KAITLIN SANDENO of Lake Forest, Calif., won the women's 400-meter individual medley in 4:40.91. MADDY CRIPPEN of Conshohocken, Pa., finished second in 4:42.81. CRISTINA TEUSCHER of New Rochelle, N.Y., a favorite, did not qualify, placing third in 4:44.42.</p>
