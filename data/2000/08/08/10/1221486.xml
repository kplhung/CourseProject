        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>BUSH PULLS UP -- All year, California polls have shown Al Gore holding a comfortable 10-point lead in a must-win state for the Democrats. But a new  survey, finished as the Republican National Convention was ending last week, shows Gov. George W. Bush of Texas running almost even with Mr. Gore in California for the first time. The poll, by the Public Policy Institute of California, found Mr. Gore winning 40 percent of likely voters to 37 percent for Mr. Bush, and 8 percent for the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader. The poll of 998 likely voters was conducted July 28 to Aug. 4 and has a margin of sampling error of four percentage points.</p>

        <p>THE FUND-RAISERS</p>
        <p>PRESSURE OVER A PARTY -- The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights is asking Vice President Al Gore to use his influence to cancel a Hispanic political action committee's fund-raiser next week at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. Mr. Gore announced several weeks ago that he would not attend the party or condone it. The gala by Hispanic Unity USA, whose chairwoman is Representative Loretta Sanchez of California, is expected to draw about 600 people. It is billed as a fund-raiser for Hispanic Unity USA, which promotes voter registration. Maria Meier, a Gore spokeswoman, said the event was not an official activity of the Democratic National Convention and that it was unfair for the Catholic group to suggest that Mr. Gore has the power to call it off.</p>

        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>GUN FINDINGS -- The Violence Policy Center, a nonprofit group promoting gun control, released a report yesterday showing that 3,370 people with licenses to carry concealed handguns in Texas had been arrested for crimes since the state's law authorizing concealed weapons took effect in 1996. Center officials said the report refuted the National Rifle Association's contentions that only law-abiding people want the permits and that the law has reduced crime. Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Gov. George W. Bush, who signed the law, said other studies had shown that people without the permits were more likely to commit crimes than people with permits. Ms. Edwards called the study ''partisan'' for singling out Texas. Center officials said they picked Texas because it had compiled better statistics.</p>
