        <p>The arrest of a prominent Bosnian banker and former government minister is being watched by foreign officials here as a test of the government's resolve to fight corruption.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Alija Delimustafic, an owner of BH Banka, which collapsed two years ago owing foreign embassies and international organizations $15 million, was arrested on Friday night and charged with fraud and abusing his position.</p>
        <p>But the case ''is not just about money going missing,'' a foreign official here said.</p>
        <p>''It is a very, very high-profile fraud case,'' the official said. ''It's an important test case, and we want to see it succeed.''</p>
        <p>Local news media have hinted that the affair goes to the core of the Bosnian leadership in Sarajevo, some of whose members were Mr. Delimustafic's close colleagues in the war from 1992 to 1995. The government has been silent on the case.</p>
        <p>Foreign officials here say corruption has reached such levels that the powerful vested interests of the governing parties are the major obstruction to democracy and development in Bosnia, as a recent report by the General Accounting Office said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Delimustafic, 46, was arrested at the offices of his company Cenex, which ran the collapsed bank and still controls a trading company, supermarket chain and an insurance company. The well-connected businessman was interior minister in the early 90's. In the war, he was foreign trade minister of a collapsed country that had almost no trade and only the most tenuous links to the outside world.</p>
        <p>According to Mirsad Bajraktarevic, head of the 120-member financial police unit that is investigating corruption in Bosnia, BH Banka collapsed with debts of $15 million. Some $900,000 of that total belonged to the United States Agency for International Development and represented operating funds and loan payments of its assistance programs to Bosnia, according to the General Accounting Office report. The Swiss Embassy has also acknowledged losing a significant sum.</p>
        <p>None of the foreign creditors has retrieved money since the bank crashed, and they have pushed the government hard to investigate the case. Cenex has continued trading, and creditors have set their sights on its assets, particularly a shopping center on the southern edge of Sarajevo.</p>
        <p>The center was probably built with some of the missing money, Mr. Bajraktarevic said in an interview. ''And the bank made credits beyond its means,'' he said, adding that the credits were not insured.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bajraktarevic's task has been to track the dealings of the bank over the last 10 years. He transferred the case to the prosecutor's office last month.</p>
        <p>''It is very complex,'' he said. ''Twenty people were involved in setting up the bank, and a lot of transfers were made out of the country, and Bosnia has not signed any international conventions.''</p>
        <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers has been brought in to audit the bank, he said.</p>
        <p>The representative for the World Bank here, Elaine Patterson, noted that banks in transitional economies are fragile and crashes are to be expected before regulations are in place. But the World Bank, itself a victim of fraud in Bosnia, has pressed hard for a full investigation and pursuit of the banks' assets to pay back creditors.</p>
