        <p>A highly classified intelligence report warns that deploying an American national missile defense could prompt China to expand its nuclear arsenal tenfold and lead Russia to place multiple warheads on ballistic missiles that now carry only one, according to officials who have reviewed it.</p>
        <p>Although the report reaffirms what China and Russia have publicly said in opposition to the system, it offers a detailed analysis of how those two nations are likely to respond and suggests that the effects of an American decision to build a nuclear defense would ripple around the globe from Europe to South Asia, the officials said.</p>
        <p>It warns that China would expand its relatively small arsenal of roughly 20 long-range nuclear missiles to a quantity large enough to overwhelm the limited defensive system that the Clinton administration is considering. One person who has seen the report said it estimated that China could deploy up to 200 warheads by 2015, prompting India and Pakistan to respond with their own buildups.</p>
        <p>Although Russia's economy is unlikely to support a large buildup of its missile forces, officials said the report found that it could again deploy shorter-range missiles along its borders and resume adding multiple warheads to its ballistic missiles. That is something Russia agreed to stop as part of the second strategic arms control treaty, or Start 2, which it ratified this year.</p>
        <p>The report, ''Foreign Responses to U.S. National Missile Defense Deployment,'' underscores warnings by opponents here and abroad that the administration's proposal to build a limited defensive system could lead to a new arms race with Russia and, to a lesser extent, in Asia.</p>
        <p>The report does not recommend for or against a national missile defense, but simply spells out potential consequences. Although it makes clear that some of those consequences could be dire, the study also underscores the emerging threat to the United States from the proliferation of ballistic missiles, which advocates have long cited as the rationale for building a system.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, who received a copy in the last few days, has said he would make a decision on whether to go ahead with the system this year based on four criteria, including two covered by the report, the threat to and the effects on overall national security, including arms control. The other criteria are the cost and the technological feasibility.</p>
        <p>This week, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said he would delay until at least next month making a recommendation to the president on the system. He cited ''a number of difficult issues'' that have to be resolved. The secretary, who has been briefed on the intelligence findings, is supposed to base his recommendation in part on the effects addressed in the report.</p>
        <p>The report, which is expected to be sent to members of Congress on Thursday, is sure to fuel the debate over whether Mr. Clinton should approve the first steps toward a defensive shield or postpone the decision until the next administration. An official who has seen the report said it included assessments that critics and supporters of a missile defense would use ''and make no one happy.''</p>
        <p>And it could affect the presidential campaign. Vice President Al Gore has largely embraced the adminstration stand of building a limited land-based system. The Republican candidate, George W. Bush, favors a broader system that could include sea- and space-based arms.</p>
        <p>The report includes an annex that repeats the intelligence assessment last year that Iraq, Iran and North Korea could develop ballistic missiles capable of hitting the United States by 2015, the officials said. In fact, the threat from North Korea may be more imminent, despite a flurry of diplomatic activity by North Korea, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Although North Korea has abided by a pledge that it made last year not to test its long-range missiles, it has continued building a three-stage missile that could hit the United States and could deploy it ''in reasonably short order,'' one official said.</p>
        <p>The report, a National Intelligence Estimate, represents the collective assessment of the nation's intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research. One senior official said the report did not intend to predict with certainty how China, Russia and other countries would respond, but rather simply laid out a range of responses.</p>
        <p>Another official, arguing that the report did not necessarily undercut the case for a missile defense, said some of the findings represented worst-case scenarios. The report says, for example, that the Russians could withdraw from ''an array of arms control treaties,'' especially if the United States went ahead without negotiating changes in the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, which prohibits national missile defenses.</p>
        <p>The official noted that although Russia had so far strongly resisted Washington's efforts to change the treaty, they have an interest in negotiating reductions in both countries' nuclear arsenals, because Russia can scarcely afford to maintain the 5,000 or so warheads that it has.</p>
        <p>The report suggests that the Russians could accept a trade-off that would strictly limit the American defensive system to 100 interceptor missiles based in Alaska, as the administration has proposed building by 2007. But without an agreement, Russia could respond by increasing the warheads on each missile.</p>
