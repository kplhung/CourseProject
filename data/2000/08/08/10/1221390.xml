        <p>Facing one of the most demanding theatrical challenges imaginable, William Houston has stopped smoking and drinking and eats steak for lunch. His obsession is so complete that he hardly noticed when a steak was brought to his table one day recently, letting it sit for half an hour before taking a bite.</p>
        <p>''This is killing me,'' Mr. Houston lamented as he crumpled his napkin into a tight ball. ''I'm so dog-tired. Living like this is driving me crazy. I'm into it every hour of the day, and then I dream about it at night. Every day I think, 'I can't do this, I'm not up to this, I'm not physically strong enough, I can't carry it off.' I look in the mirror and see myself aging.''</p>

        <p>Facing one of the most demanding theatrical challenges imaginable, William Houston has stopped smoking and drinking and eats steak for lunch. His obsession is so complete that he hardly noticed when a steak was brought to his table one day recently, letting it sit for half an hour before taking a bite.</p>
        <p>''This is killing me,'' Mr. Houston lamented as he crumpled his napkin into a tight ball. ''I'm so dog-tired. Living like this is driving me crazy. I'm into it every hour of the day, and then I dream about it at night. Every day I think, 'I can't do this, I'm not up to this, I'm not physically strong enough, I can't carry it off.' I look in the mirror and see myself aging.''</p>
        <p>Finally noticing the plate in front of him, he sighed, tossed the mangled napkin onto the table and tried to calm himself. ''All right, all right, we'll get it,'' he said, seemingly to himself. ''Little stressed out these days.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Houston is a crucial figure in an extraordinary dramatic marathon that is unfolding on the stages of the Royal Shakespeare Company here. Over the next year the company will present, in chronological order, eight history plays in which Shakespeare depicts the upheaval of 15th-century England. The plays contain some of his finest poetry, deepest insights and most memorable characters.</p>
        <p>Because the plays cover such closely related historical events, seeing them together is an incomparably richer experience than seeing them individually. It is also a rare one, having been attempted less than a half-dozen times on the British stage.</p>
        <p>Part of the fascination of the current series is that many roles are carried from one play to the next by the same actors. Mr. Houston appears as the wild Prince Hal in the first part of ''Henry IV,'' drinking, wenching and stealing purses. In the second part he portrays the prince as he assumes the throne, pledging that he has ''turned away my former self.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Houston is also rehearsing the title role of ''Henry V,'' the warrior king who inspires his nation by conquering France and setting an example of noble leadership. He must play the character over a period of more than two decades, growing not just in years but in wisdom and dignity.</p>
        <p>To add to the challenge, the first two plays are performed in period costume while the third, which is to have its premiere on Aug. 24, has a different director and is done in a modern post-apocalyptic setting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Houston, 32, has played just one title role with the Royal Shakespeare Company, the relatively straightforward male lead in ''Troilus and Cressida.''</p>
        <p>Shakespeare's eight-play sequence covers a period of 87 years. The first play, ''Richard II,'' opens in 1398 with the king adjudicating a dispute between two of his nobles, one of whom, Henry Bolingbroke, will soon rise up to overthrow him.</p>
        <p>The series continues with both parts of ''Henry IV,'' which show Bolingbroke reigning as a troubled monarch, then dying and leaving his throne to Hal; ''Henry V,'' in which Hal rules brilliantly; and the three parts of ''Henry VI,'' depicting England's collapse into civil war. It ends with ''Richard III,'' whose title character rises to power by killing his closest friends and relatives.</p>
        <p>The last scene of ''Richard III'' depicts the king's death in battle as he calls in vain for a horse. Bosworth Field, where the battle was fought in 1485, is 40 miles from Stratford. A plaque marks the spot where Richard fell.</p>
        <p>After the Stratford season ends in October, the first of the history plays will move to London. The series will continue into next year. There is no plan for a full-fledged foreign tour, although the company will perform the last four plays at the University of Michigan on two successive weekends next March.</p>
        <p>In the two plays in which Mr. Houston is now appearing, he seems to pull the full measure of poetry out of his lines. As his character ages, not simply his style but also his tone and mannerisms change.</p>
        <p>To succeed, however, the first plays of the series need much more than simply a gifted actor as Hal. The role of Bolingbroke needs at least an equal talent, and for that the Royal Shakespeare Company has chosen one of its veterans, David Troughton. He portrays Bolingbroke first as an offended knight, then as a scheming politician who deposes a king, andfinally as a dying monarch who fears God will never forgive him for the ''indirect crook'd ways I met this crown.''</p>
        <p>''A play's relevance to the modern day, no matter how old the play is, will come out,'' Mr. Troughton said before one recent performance. ''It was just so brilliant that as we were preparing this play, a bunch of British football hooligans were arrested in France. It shows what the plays are telling us, which is that we are a nation of thugs. We are very good at beating people up.''</p>
        <p>''Patriotism and jingoism is what moves this country,'' he said. ''When Bolingbroke dies, he tells his son to 'busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels.'' Mr. Troughton sees contemporary parallels like the war in the Falklands. And he likens Bolingbroke to Prime Minister Tony Blair, ''because he's so desperate to be liked and knows every trick to use to become liked.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Troughton and others involved in the project do not see its importance as limited to Britain. In the lobby of one of the Stratford theaters they are displaying a notebook full of material they used to prepare themselves. It includes historical accounts and a newspaper article portraying Mr. Blair as obsessed with his image, but also articles about slaughter in Africa and photographs of 20th-century strongmen ranging from Franco to Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>The two parts of ''Henry IV'' are classics not just because of the ways they deal with great historical and political themes, or even because of their magnificent verse. They are also the works that brought to life one of the great comic figures in theatrical history, the bloated Falstaff, ''that trunk of humors, that bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly.''</p>
        <p>Much of the attraction of the plays is that they cover vast ground, from city to country, battlefield to council chamber, royal palace to taverns and brothels, and that their characters are not only contending nobles but also drunkards, braggarts, pickpockets and whores. Without Falstaff the plays would be all but unthinkable, and in the current Stratford productions Falstaff is played by Desmond Barrit, who established a reputation as a great comic actor with his successes as Malvolio in ''Twelfth Night'' and Bottom in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.''</p>
        <p>''The great thing for me and for everyone in these plays is that you have so much time to develop your character,'' Mr. Barrit said as he sipped tea on a balcony overlooking the Avon River. ''You needn't show too much at once. Not only do you have a chance to decide what you want to hold back for the second scene, you can even hold things back for the second play.''</p>
        <p>As with the actors who play Bolingbroke and Prince Hal, Mr. Barrit finds himself merging with his character more fully than many actors do when they perform in single plays. After some performances he turns up at a pub down the street from the theater, and there he seems almost as riveting a figure as Falstaff was in the taverns of Eastcheap.</p>
        <p>The two personalities even merge onstage.</p>
        <p>''Prince Charles is the patron of our company, and Henry IV is his favorite play,'' Mr. Barrit said with a Falstaffian glimmer in his eye. ''He came to one of our first performances, and at the point where Falstaff says he hopes to become a duke or an earl, I stared right at him. Later I realized I was doing just was Falstaff did. I was looking at the future king of England and saying I hoped the knighthood would be pending.''</p>
