        <p>In what the company calls ''the ultimate remote control,'' owners of ReplayTV-based digital video recorders may soon be able to operate their recorders at home from anywhere in the world through the Internet. For example, a New Yorker traveling in Texas would be able to log on to the www.myreplaytv.com Web site, view hometown program listings, set the recorder to capture a show, view the amount of recording time left on the disk and make sure that the show is being recorded. Of course, that's assuming that the system works as described yesterday. ReplayTV concedes that it has not been tested outside the laboratory.</p>
        <p>The new service, called MyReplayTV, will be available this fall, when ReplayTV upgrades the system software for its recorders, said Jim Hollingsworth, a senior vice president for the company, which is in Mountain View, Calif.</p>

        <p>Unlike the more common videocassette recorders, digital video recorders capture programs as digital files on a giant hard disk; users can easily skip through commercials and other tedious parts of a program. A ReplayTV recorder with 30 hours of capacity costs about $600, and one with 20 hours costs $400 to $500.</p>
