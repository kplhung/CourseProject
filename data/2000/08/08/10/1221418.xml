        <p>The Jets have run a bruising drill every day during training camp. It is a scrimmage designed to test, over and over, pounding after pounding, a goal-line situation.

        <p>But earlier this week, there was Martin, streaking 40 yards down the right sideline, no ball in hand. This was Martin the receiver, Martin the all-around back, Martin the man who wants to help make up for the loss of Keyshawn Johnson. Martin caught a perfect strike from quarterback Chad Pennington on that play, the type he had prepared for all spring, when he did extra conditioning work running flights of stairs in his Florida high-rise so his legs and lungs would grow stronger and his already enormous workload could be enhanced.</p>

        <p>The Jets have run a bruising drill every day during training camp. It is a scrimmage designed to test, over and over, pounding after pounding, a goal-line situation. And nearly every day Curtis Martin squirts free, emerging from the maelstrom like a hiker finding daylight from behind a thicket of trees.</p>
        <p>But earlier this week, there was Martin, streaking 40 yards down the right sideline, no ball in hand. This was Martin the receiver, Martin the all-around back, Martin the man who wants to help make up for the loss of Keyshawn Johnson. Martin caught a perfect strike from quarterback Chad Pennington on that play, the type he had prepared for all spring, when he did extra conditioning work running flights of stairs in his Florida high-rise so his legs and lungs would grow stronger and his already enormous workload could be enhanced.</p>
        <p>Bill Parcells, the director of football operations, spoke to Martin during the spring, and his words about preparation were a challenge. Aware of the gap in the passing game left by the trade of Johnson, Martin -- the already quietly spectacular workhorse who last season was the second-leading rusher (1,464 yards), with the second-most attempts (367) in the American Football Conference -- hopes to produce a dramatic uptick in his receptions. Last season, Martin caught 45 passes for 259 yards, meaning he touched the ball a staggering 412 times, an average of almost 26 plays game. Now, Martin wants more. Give him the darn ball.</p>
        <p>''I've taken a lot of carries per year, and I catch a fair amount of balls,'' Martin said. ''I know I can take on more. I'm looking forward to becoming more of a well-rounded back. I want to expand that role. I came in this year with the intent to be in better shape than I've ever been so I could take that extra workload if needed.</p>
        <p>''Each year I try to come in better than last year. I do feel at my best. Parcells spoke something to me that changed my outlook. He said some guys do the routine over and over. Others are committed. Although I know I'm a guy that is committed to getting better, it just raised my commitment to a higher level. He just sparked a higher flame.''</p>
        <p>It has showed in the Jets' first two games. Although used only early in both games -- and not often in the passing game -- Martin has rushed 16 times for 89 yards. He has scored one touchdown, but he has been most effective in close-in situations.</p>
        <p>In one early drive against the Packers, Martin carried the ball four times starting on Green Bay's 23-yard line, gaining all 18 yards (there was a 5-yard defensive holding penalty) and scoring a touchdown.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if you can anticipate any more from Curtis,'' fullback Richie Anderson said. ''He's sharpened his game a lot. He's seeing things better than before.''</p>
        <p>The Jets will undoubtedly rely on that improved vision as they lean more heavily on the running game while all the young receivers continue to find their bearings.</p>
        <p>The Jets ranked near the bottom of the A.F.C. in offense inside the opposition's 20-yard line last season. Of 51 possessions, the Jets scored only 20 touchdowns (39.2 percent). Only New England and Baltimore had worse percentages in the conference and only Philadelphia, Chicago and Tampa Bay had lower percentages in the National Football Conference.</p>
        <p>But the Jets have a young and improving offensive line that, while drawing early praise for not allowing the opposition to put a hand on quarterback Vinny Testaverde in the first two games, also relishes the opportunity, according to right guard Randy Thomas, to ''hit guys in the mouth and move them off the ball.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Left cornerback AARON GLENN, who sprained his left ankle in Tuesday's practice, did not practice Wednesday. If Glenn is unable to play against Baltimore Saturday, the nickel back RAY MICKENS will start instead. . . . Defensive end ANTHONY COOK had his back examined Tuesday afternoon, but Coach AL GROH, who is extremely reticent about injuries, did not discuss the results. . . . Receiver YATIL GREEN missed practice with a groin injury. . . . Groh said that receivers WAYNE CHREBET and DEDRIC WARD are set as his starters entering the season ''until somebody proves they can play it better.'' But because the Jets frequently employ three- and four-receiver sets, there is still considerable competition among LAVERANUES COLES, WINDRELL HAYES, FRED COLEMAN and Green. . . . In an effort to improve and assess the versatility of the defensive ends, RICK LYLE, who usually plays left defensive end, will play right end this weekend, while DORIAN BOOSE, who played right end last week, will switch to the left side.</p>
