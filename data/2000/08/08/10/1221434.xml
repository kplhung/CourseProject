        <p>Amtrak's ridership hit a 10-year high in July, and the number of passengers for the year is poised to set a record, railroad officials said today, crediting extensive investments to improve reliability and service.</p>
        <p>But the road toward profitability is still rocky. While ticket sales are strong, the gains in ticket revenues so far this year make up only about half of the money lost because of delays in introducing the high-speed Acela service, now about a year behind schedule.</p>
        <p>The railroad hopes to begin phasing in the 150-mile-per-hour Acela trains on the Washington-Boston route this fall but has had technical difficulties. It is seeking tens of millions of dollars in damages from the manufacturers.</p>
        <p>Even with the growth in ticket sales, revenues for the year will be $60 million to $70 million less than anticipated because of the loss of $156 million in revenues from the Acela Express, the company estimated. But some spending has been avoided, including payments on the new trains.</p>
        <p>Amtrak will lose money again this year but will meet the Congressional deadline of weaning itself from operating subsidies by the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2002, officials said. It expects to need capital subsidies indefinitely.</p>
        <p>George Warrington, Amtrak's  president, said ridership was up because service was better and because ''the marketplace is feeling increasingly frustrated with the alternatives,'' namely jammed highways and delayed airplanes.</p>
        <p>The railroad introduced a ''satisfaction guarantee'' four weeks ago, and credits that with helping to raise patronage. Ticket sales in July were $107.2 million, 11.6 percent ahead of the same month last year, breaking the previous record, set in June, of $102.3 million.</p>
        <p>People who submit claims under the guarantee get a free trip. Some travelers say that when they initially complained about extensive delays or other poor service, they were first offered gift certificates that fell short of the ticket price. The railroad says, however, that it has a ''no questions asked'' policy if a passenger asks for the satisfaction guarantee.</p>
        <p>Amtrak ridership statistics go back to 1975. Ridership peaked in 1990 but declined as the number of trains and the quality of service declined in the 1990's, even as travel surged overall.</p>
        <p>Ridership rose very sharply on several long-distance trains, including the Cascades, which runs between Vancouver, British Columbia, and Eugene, Ore., and the Texas Eagle, which operates between Chicago and San Antonio. The number of weekly trips was increased on both, but ridership grew even faster.</p>
        <p>The reason, said William Schulz, a spokesman, is that adding trains had created ''greater connectivity and reach,'' with more customers riding the trains as the network grew. Railroad officials said earlier this year that their old strategy, trimming service to cut costs to balance the books, had resulted in too much pruning, and a system that was withering away.</p>
        <p>The Acela Regional service, which has sharply cut travel times between New York and Boston, but not by as much as the Acela Express is supposed to, has seen a 39 percent increase in ridership over the trains it replaced, the railroad said.</p>
        <p>Five high-speed Acela trains are being tested on the Northeast corridor, and passengers going through Philadelphia can often see them parked on sidings. But they have had mechanical problems, including missing and broken bolts.</p>
        <p>Still, the railroad said its basic operations were vastly improved from the mid-90's. In those days, said Mr. Warrington, ''the organization was on the edge of its seat.''</p>
        <p>''It was in a very difficult position from a cash and budget point of view,'' he said. ''The approach that was taken, which in retrospect, was short-sighted, was to nickel-and-dime, to ratchet back service levels and, at a practical level, service quality.''</p>
        <p>The effect was ''to begin to dismantle the national system,'' he said. ''Service degenerated, quality dropped several notches, and loyalty erodes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The railroad was founded in 1972 by the federal government, which combined the passenger assets of several freight railroads.</p>
