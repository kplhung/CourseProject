        <p>The committee planning the 40th reunion in mid-November of the Stamford High School class of 1960 did not get much done at its meeting on Tuesday night. The committee members were far too distracted by the thought that their classmate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, might very well become the next vice president of the United States.</p>
        <p>''We still need to have quite a few more meetings, because all we were talking about was Joe last night,'' said Vita Lionetti, who introduced Mr. Lieberman at a Democratic campaign rally here tonight.</p>
        <p>Another committee member, Lenora Cavaliero, said, ''We just couldn't stop. We were falling apart, crying, just so overwhelmed, saying, 'My God, this is too good to be true.' ''</p>
        <p>The old soda-pop hangouts, Lucy's Drive-In and the Cadillac luncheonette are long gone, and this once-quaint town is now a bustling corporate mecca, but Joe Lieberman is still wearing the same smile he did at graduation in 1960, friends say. And as he returned here tonight, riding triumphantly in the motorcade of Vice President Al Gore, the presidential candidate, all of Stamford seemed to swell with pride.</p>
        <p>''It's a momentous occasion,'' exulted Mayor Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat. ''It's an exciting time for Stamford. You couldn't overstate how excited this community is.''</p>
        <p>In one of the opening speeches at tonight's rally, Mr. Malloy proclaimed, ''There are 111,000 people in Stamford and there's 111,000 stories about Joe Lieberman, what a great guy he is.''</p>
        <p>That Mr. Lieberman is the first Jewish American to run on a national ticket for a major party will forever be a historical footnote. And the footnote to that, Stamford residents noted proudly tonight, will be that he was born here, on Feb. 24, 1942.</p>
        <p>''Stamford has always been his hometown,'' Mr. Malloy said. ''He may have represented New Haven but the reality is, he is coming back to Stamford.''</p>
        <p>The banner headline in this morning's issue of The Advocate, the local daily newspaper, was simply: ''He's Coming Home.'' And, although tonight's rally was by invitation only, people with tickets nevertheless started lining up at 3 p.m., four hours before Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Gore were expected to arrive at the Italian Center, a recreation complex and catering hall.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign, seeking to emphasize the vice presidential candidate's roots, had hoped to hold tonight's rally at Stamford High School, where Mr. Lieberman began his political career by running for president of his ninth-grade class. But the building on Strawberry Hill Avenue was not available because of summertime construction and renovation projects.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lionetti recalled in an interview that she had been elected prom queen by the class of 1960 and that her husband, Alexander, had lost the contest for prom king by one vote to -- who else? -- Joe Lieberman. ''He was a winner from then on,'' she said. ''Not one thing has changed, except his success.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lionetti said that Mr. Lieberman's success has meant a great deal to his old friends and to his hometown of Stamford.</p>
        <p>''It will always be home to him,'' she said. ''This is where his roots are and no matter where Joe is, no matter where he goes, he has a following. We are so proud. We are really so, so proud.''</p>
        <p>Through the afternoon, people stopped to stare at a crowd of photographers and television cameramen gathered across Strawberry Hill Court from the home of Mr. Lieberman's mother, Marcia. The candidates visited there briefly before joining the 1,000 exuberant supporters at the rally, which included many of Connecticut's elected Democrats.</p>
        <p>The crowd there roared gleefully when Mr. Gore introduced Mr. Lieberman as a ''son of Stamford'' and ''the next vice president of the United States.''</p>
        <p>To chants of ''Joe, Joe, Joe,'' Mr. Lieberman took the lectern and became teary-eyed in describing his emotions. ''It, of course, has always been good to come home,'' he said. ''But never have I felt more grateful and more proud.''</p>
        <p>He recalled standing in the same ballroom at the Italian Center for testimonial dinners and for previous  high school reunions. And, he added, ''What a thrill to come home on Air Force Two to Stamford with my mom.'' He thanked Stamford for his public school education and said that it was mishaps on the town's Little League fields as a child that led him to a career in politics.</p>
        <p>The excitement and preparations for tonight's rally began early Tuesday. While Mr. Gore was officially announcing Mr. Lieberman's selection at a rally in Nashville, local officials here were meeting with Secret Service agents and campaign personnel. The Democratic candidates flew north to Stamford after visiting Mr. Gore's hometown, Carthage, Tenn., earlier in the day.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cavaliero said she was flabbergasted that history was being made so close to home. ''Just that somebody from your own town, as it was then, could build up and do something like this,'' she said. ''I guess it goes to prove that when you are that determined and have faith and believe in yourself, it really can happen. You can be yourself and still get that kind of distinction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, in his speech, made very much the same point. He spoke of his father, who worked in a bakery and later owned a liquor store in Stamford, and his grandmother, who was an immigrant from Central Europe, both of whom, he said, reveled in America's basic freedoms. ''Anybody should be able to succeed here,'' he said.</p>
