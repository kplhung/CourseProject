        <p>EGYPT: DEFENDING PEACE EFFORTS -- In the first high-level response to Clinton administration critics, Osama el-Baz, an aide to President Hosni Mubarak, gave a spirited defense of the Egyptian role in advancing Arab-Israeli peace. ''It is utter nonsense to think we are urging the Palestinian negotiators to harden their positions,'' he said. ''We have every interest to encourage a closing of the gap between the parties.''</p>

        <p>SAUDI ARABIA: HOUSING COMPOUND SHOOTOUT -- Saudi guards and a university student exchanged gunfire at a compound housing American and other military personnel and their families, leaving a Saudi guard dead and three other people wounded. The student was arrested shortly after the shooting, a Defense Ministry statement said. A United States Embassy spokeswoman said all the Americans at the compound were safe. She gave no further details.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>SPAIN: ARMY OFFICER SLAIN -- A Spanish Army officer, Sub-Lt. Francisco Casanova, 46, was shot dead in Pamplona in the latest of a string of attacks this week linked to the Basque separatist group E.T.A., the police said. The group was blamed for two car bombings in Madrid and the northern town of Zumaia on Tuesday. The Zumaia bombing killed a prominent businessman, Jose Maria Korta, 52. He was buried yesterday in a service attended by hundreds of mourners.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: PARTY MAY BE BANNED -- The government held talks with leaders of the country's 16 states over a possible ban on the rightist National Democratic Party, which is viewed by some politicians as a force with links to anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic attacks. The party is too small to be represented in Parliament. A party may be banned by the Constitutional Court if it is deemed to be a danger to democracy, but no such ban has been approved since the 1950's, when the Communist Party was outlawed.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: UNDIPLOMATIC COMMENTS -- Germany's ambassador-designate to Israel, Rudolf Dressler, faced fierce protest after saying in a newspaper interview that he favored the establishment of an ''international administration'' for Jerusalem. Mr. Dressler, a longtime member of the governing Social Democratic Party, is to take up his post on Sept. 1. In a statement, he pledged not to express the views voiced in the interview once he becomes ambassador.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: MANEUVERING FOR DISMISSALS -- Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's office scheduled a meeting of government ministers for today to discuss options after President Ahmet Necdet Sezer vetoed a decree that would have allowed the dismissal of thousands of civil servants suspected of involvement in separatist or Islamic fundamentalist activities. The Ecevit government tried to make the change through a decree, avoiding likely defeat in Parliament. But Mr. Sezer, the presiding judge of Turkey's Constitutional Court until he was elected president in May, said the proposed change required parliamentary approval.</p>

        <p>CANADA: CONSERVATIVES DEFECT -- The rightist Canadian Alliance won a major breakthrough in Quebec, the nation's second most populous province, with the defection of half of the executive leadership of the Quebec Conservative Party as well as the party presidents for 25 districts. The switch culminated a two-week stay in Quebec by Stockwell Day, leader of the alliance, which is trying to expand its base.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: NEW TAMIL ATTACKS -- Tamil Tiger rebels stepped up attacks on security forces, killing 13 people, a day after the government was forced to put on hold its new constitution aimed at ending the war. Six soldiers were killed near the northern government-held town of Vavuniya, and seven people died just outside the eastern town of Trincomalee. The draft constitution would give greater power to regions, including one administered by ethnic minority Tamils, but did not find enough support in Parliament.</p>

        <p>PAKISTAN: BANNED FROM POLITICS -- The military government has issued a decree that bars anyone from holding office in a political party who has been convicted of a criminal offense involving moral turpitude or who has been found guilty of violating the antiterrorism act. The decree would seem to prohibit two former prime ministers, Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, from any leadership role in politics.</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: MORE TALIBAN GAINS -- Taliban forces entered the suburbs of Taloqan, the capital of Takhar Province, a key opposition base on the border with Tajikistan, the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press reported. The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of the country, have made steady gains in recent fighting and cut a crucial opposition supply line.</p>

        <p>IVORY COAST: GENERAL SEEKS PRESIDENCY -- Gen. Robert  Guei, who seized power in a coup last year, declared his interest in running as a candidate in the presidential election scheduled for September. The general said he would seek the nomination of the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, which had held power since independence four decades ago until the former president, Henri Konan Bedie, was overthrown in December.</p>

        <p>SUDAN: U.N. COMPOUND BOMBED -- The day after the United Nations suspended aid flights in Sudan, a government plane again bombed a United Nations compound in the rebel-held south. On Monday, 18 bombs were dropped near the compound at Mapel in the state of Bahl-el-Ghazal; on Wednesday 9 more bombs were dropped. No one was hurt in either incident. But United Nations officials said the Sudanese government had pledged late last month not to attack official aid flights.</p>
