        <p>Ever since the Bridgestone Corporation bought Firestone in one of the many high-profile Japanese takeovers of the 1980's, the United States tire maker has been a problem child.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone, the world's second- largest tire producer after the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, paid $2.6 billion for Firestone in 1988 and spent billions more to expand its faltering operations, reduce heavy debt and trim fat. The initial results were disappointing as Firestone sustained big losses, failed to increase its market share, and suffered from a bitter labor dispute.</p>
        <p>But just as Firestone seemed to be growing up, with its tire sales to auto dealers accelerating in recent years, the company announced a recall on Wednesday of 6.55 million tires that are the subject of a United States government safety investigation into at least 46 deaths.</p>
        <p>The tire recall, though not nearly as extensive as the recall of 14 million tires that Firestone undertook in the 1970's is expected to cost Bridgestone as much as $500 million, according to estimates by industry analysts, and is potentially damaging to the Firestone brand name. Some analysts have predicted that the company will suffer a loss in market share, especially since many of the tire accidents under investigation involved Ford Explorer sports utility vehicles that are popular with families.</p>
        <p>Rumors of the tire recall, which have been circulating in the business community in Tokyo for several days, sent Bridgestone shares tumbling in heavy trading on Wednesday in anticipation of a company announcement in the United States.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone's stock declined 8.2 percent, to 2,075 yen, or about $19.23 at current exchange rates on Wednesday. In early trading on Thursday, it fell another 11 percent, to 1,834 yen.</p>
        <p>The company's shares have dropped 17 percent since reports emerged last week that consumer groups considered the tires unsafe, and that Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, a leading American retailer, had stopped selling the tires in question. Bridgestone has made 48 million of the tires since it began manufacturing them in 1990.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that Bridgestone, which had operating profit of $2.18 billion in the fiscal year ended March 31, could easily absorb the initial impact of the recall but some expressed concern about the long-term impact, which they said would be largely determined by the outcome of the government's investigation and whether Firestone could escape the stigma of a tainted brand.</p>
        <p>The inquiry is being conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has received 270 complaints, including reports of 46 deaths and 80 injuries, concerning Firestone truck tires.</p>
        <p>Firestone has recalled tires before. In 1978, the company recalled 14 million of its 500-series tires that suffered tread separations and blowouts. Government regulators also fined the company $500,000 for concealing the safety problems. Partly as a result of the recall, Firestone suffered financial problems and was later acquired by Bridgestone.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone, which has headquarters in Tokyo, declined to comment on the recall, referring inquiries to its Firestone division in the United States. Bridgestone sought to portray the situation as largely an American problem, but Firestone accounted for 40 percent of the parent company's consolidated sales last year.</p>
        <p>Some analysts have criticized Japanese companies for being slow to respond when their American operations faced problems that resulted in public relations nightmares.</p>
        <p>Last year, the Toshiba Corporation agreed to a $1 billion settlement of a class-action lawsuit contending the company, had sold five million defective laptop computers in the United States since 1987.</p>
        <p>In 1997, the Mitsubushi Motors Corporation agreed to a number of steps to improve job opportunities for women and minorities, but only after the United States government brought one of the country's largest sexual harassment suits against its American subsidiary and civil rights advocates threatened a car boycott.</p>
        <p>Daiwa Bank, one of the biggest banks in Japan, also has been haunted by a failure to fix problems at its American operations. In 1996 Daiwa pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the United States that its managers had covered up more than $1 billion in trading losses at the bank's New York branch over many years.</p>
