        <p>Battered by a hostile Parliament for his haphazard management style, President Abdurrahman Wahid said today that he would hand over daily government administration to Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri.</p>
        <p>His announcement came after raucous attacks on Tuesday in a legislature where he can count on the support of only a small minority and where some members have called for his impeachment.</p>
        <p>''Regarding the criticisms of my style of management, I can understand them, and I will assign the vice president to handle the daily tasks of management, to draw up the cabinet's working agenda and to establish the focus and priorities of government,'' Mr. Wahid said.</p>
        <p>In the speech, read by an aide because the president is virtually blind, he emphasized that Mrs. Megawati would report to him and that the arrangement was within the constitutional framework of the presidential system.</p>
        <p>It was a retreat for Mr. Wahid after 10 tumultuous months in office, but perhaps a tactical one as he fends off threats from almost all sides, including much of the tenuous coalition that voted him into office.</p>
        <p>It was not clear, in the long run, whether it would calm the political scene, where uncertainty and disarray have caused the currency to slide in value and investors to withhold their business from Indonesia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid said on Monday that he would appoint a deputy to handle the daily affairs of government while he concentrated more on external affairs. Prominent figures in Parliament immediately insisted that Mrs. Megawati be chosen.</p>
        <p>It was not clear how this devolution of his duties would be carried out, and aides said the details of the arrangement had yet to be worked out. Mrs. Megawati, though politically popular, is not a hands-on manager, and the possibility remained that a separate ''first minister'' would be appointed to report to her.</p>
        <p>''I suppose it amounts to facing a new reality and new expectations and making the best of a complex and difficult situation,'' said Aristides Katoppo, an editor and political commentator. ''There may still be compromises within the compromise.''</p>
        <p>Greg Barton, an Australian academic who is writing Mr. Wahid's biography and has daily access to him, said: ''We'll have to wait and see in the next days. I think we've just seen a fairly slick bit of footwork. He's seized the initiative and turned it around on his own terms.''</p>
        <p>Although Mrs. Megawati won a large plurality in June 1999 in Indonesia's first democratic election, Mr. Wahid triumphed in the parliamentary session in October that formally chose the president.</p>
        <p>He had won only a small portion of the popular vote but was the compromise choice of legislators who opposed Mrs. Megawati. Now much of that coalition has turned against him as Indonesian politics descends into a free-for-all.</p>
        <p>Some political commentators said today that Mr. Wahid's opponents, having failed to manipulate him in office, might be hoping that Mrs. Megawati is a softer target.</p>
        <p>The new arrangement, if it does move forward, throws Indonesia's leadership into new flux, political experts said. The relationship between the president and vice president has been difficult, and their political constituencies remain at odds.</p>
        <p>''This is probably a necessary but insufficient condition for trying to reach a deal,'' a Western diplomat said of the announcement. ''What has got to be done is to see whether the offer is accepted and how it works in practice. The devil is in the details and the modalities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid had already handed certain responsibilities to his vice president -- including management of separatist and sectarian violence in Irian Jaya and the Maluku islands -- but she had been largely passive as those crises worsened, he noted.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Wahid described their relations on Monday as like brother and sister, their dealings in recent weeks have been severely strained. Mrs. Megawati did not attend his birthday party last week and declined his request to read recent speeches on his behalf.</p>
        <p>''So the issue is whether they can establish a modus vivendi to really work these things out,'' the diplomat said. ''If she is to be a kind of de facto prime minister, the question will be whether she is prepared to exercise power and whether the president and vice president are prepared to work together in a constructive way.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Megawati, the daughter of Indonesia's founding father, Sukarno, has broad and enthusiastic public support. She has shown little appetite for political battle or active leadership, but she has put together a solid team of aides.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid has earned widespread respect for his integrity and democratic ideals but has demonstrated little aptitude for administration. In addition, he has found himself in charge of weak and incompetent government institutions that were neutered and corrupted during the 32-year rule of President Suharto, who was forced from office in May 1998.</p>
        <p>Often, when Mr. Wahid pulls the levers of power, little happens.</p>
        <p>But he has shown himself a master of one-upmanship, disarming his challengers with unexpected moves that Mr. Barton, his biographer, recently compared to the deceptively agile swordplay of the drunken master of martial arts films.</p>
        <p>After his address tonight, the president seemed to be in high spirits, Mr. Barton said: ''He turned to me, and he said, chuckling, 'So the drunken master wins again.' ''</p>
