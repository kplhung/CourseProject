        <p>Robbie Davis stood near the scales waiting to find out whether the stewards were going to let him into the winner's circle. He had been there twice already today, and as he wrangled the sprinter Intidab over the finish line a head in front of Successful Appeal it looked as if he had another good day in the books: a victory in the Grade II, A. G. Vanderbilt Handicap.</p>
        <p>But after a 15-minute delay the No. 8 atop the tote board was flashed down to second place and Successful Appeal was declared the winner. After watching dozens of head-on replays, the racing stewards decided that Davis and Intidab had indeed edged over and bumped -- if ever so slightly -- Edgar Prado and Successful Appeal.</p>

        <p>Robbie Davis stood near the scales waiting to find out whether the stewards were going to let him into the winner's circle. He had been there twice already today, and as he wrangled the sprinter Intidab over the finish line a head in front of Successful Appeal it looked as if he had another good day in the books: a victory in the Grade II, A. G. Vanderbilt Handicap.</p>
        <p>But after a 15-minute delay the No. 8 atop the tote board was flashed down to second place and Successful Appeal was declared the winner. After watching dozens of head-on replays, the racing stewards decided that Davis and Intidab had indeed edged over and bumped -- if ever so slightly -- Edgar Prado and Successful Appeal.</p>
        <p>The jockey wasn't so sure. He and Prado had hooked up in the lane of the six-furlong dash after waiting out two speedballs, Texas Glitter and Falkenburg, in a furious half-mile run in 44.69 seconds. The top two choices, moving in tandem, swallowed the front-runners in the middle of the stretch, then snuggled up to each other for their duel.</p>
        <p>Davis popped Intidab with a right-hand whip after his horse refused to change leads, or switch his stride to his stronger side. The 7-year-old son of Phone Trick responded and drifted inside, where Prado had Successful Appeal in stride. Twice, the two horses bumped rumps on the way to a clocking of  1 minute 9.21 seconds.</p>
        <p>''We were following him down inside, and there was a little contact,'' Davis said. ''It wasn't that big of a deal. It could have gone either way.''</p>
        <p>So instead of notching his 12th victory of the meet and tying Pat Day for second place behind the leaders Jorge Chavez and Jerry Bailey -- both with 15 victories -- Davis watched the $120,000 first-place check drift to the connections of Successful Appeal: the owners Starview Stable and John T. L. Jones Jr.; the trainer, John Kimmel; and Prado.</p>
        <p>Even Prado and Kimmel believed the call could have gone either way.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want to get my hopes up because I couldn't really tell from the side,'' said Kimmel, who won for the second time after three other showings in the money. ''I thought I was dead here. He runs great and we run second. That pretty much is how the meet has gone. I'm just happy to be a winner.''</p>
        <p>But Davis took the setback graciously. He believes he can contend for the riding title. He is riding well and will be aided because John Velazquez, who broke his collarbone in a fall last Saturday, will be out six weeks.</p>
        <p>St. Julien Is Riding and Winning</p>
        <p>Another jockey stepping into the void is Marlon St. Julien, who came to New York after working his way through Louisiana, Texas and Kentucky. Nick Zito and Allen Jerkens were the first New Yorkers to embrace him. He has recorded five victories.</p>
        <p>''My goal was 10 in my first summer here,'' St. Julien said. ''I know first-timers usually struggle here, but I was confident that the more I won the more chances I'd get. Now people are starting to call.''</p>
        <p>St. Julien, 28, will travel to Woodbine in Toronto to ride the undefeated Plenty of Light for Elliott Walden in the $125,000 Duchess Stakes on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Richter Scale Back on Track</p>
        <p>No matter how impressive Intidab and Successful Appeal proved today, somewhere down the line the pair will have to take on Richter Scale, who won the De Francis Dash on July 15 at Laurel in 1:074/5 , a track record. Richter Scale breezed over four furlongs on the Saratoga main track this morning, his first meaningful workout since the De Francis.</p>
        <p>He has battled foot problems throughout his career and was equipped with bar shoes after being stuck in a stall by the heavy rainfall.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to work him in the mud with the bar shoes on so we had to wait a few days,'' said the trainer, Mary Jo Lohmeier.  ''The work itself went fine.I didn't want him to go too fast. That's about as slow as he'll go.''</p>
