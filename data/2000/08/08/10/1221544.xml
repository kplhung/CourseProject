        <p>It is the classic question for an athlete in a team sport, and Darryl Hamilton was conflicted. Individual or team? When Hamilton was rehabilitating his toe injury in New York, he could not decide if he really wanted his replacements to succeed.</p>
        <p>''That's what probably drove me crazy,'' said Hamilton, the Mets outfielder who rejoined the team tonight after four months on the disabled list. ''I'm sitting there wanting these guys to do well, and thinking, 'When I come back, where am I going to fit?' ''</p>
        <p>It is a reasonable question. Hamilton fit onto the roster when the Mets designated the infielder Matt Franco for assignment, possibly ending Franco's five-year run with the club. But Hamilton is used to playing every day, and while he was out, Benny Agbayani and Jay Payton emerged as capable starting outfielders.</p>
        <p>Hamilton homered in his only at-bat, as a pinch-hitter tonight, and he played two innings in left field. He will start Thursday's game in left or center, but tonight, as usual, Agbayani started in left and Payton in center for the Mets' 12-5 victory over the Houston Astros.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Hamilton realized it was foolish to even think about his role, or the performances of Agbayani and Payton in his absence. ''God bless 'em,'' he said he finally thought. ''I hope they do well.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton's left big toe is arthritic, and five games into the regular season, he realized an off-season surgical procedure had not eliminated the pain. He had another operation in May, but a rehabilitation assignment in June lasted only one day.</p>
        <p>Frustrated with his progress during workouts in New York -- ''I felt like the toe was just hanging by a thread,'' he said -- Hamilton persuaded the Mets to let him work out with a trainer near his home in Houston. When he overcame his guilt about not playing, Hamilton said, he allowed himself to concentrate solely on the toe.</p>
        <p>''I realized a couple of months ago, I've just got to rest it and let this thing heal, because it's not my fault the toe is giving me problems,'' Hamilton said. ''I can have all the surgeries in the world, but if it doesn't heal right, there's nothing I can do.''</p>
        <p>Working for two weeks with a physical therapist, Hamilton built the strength back in the toe and joined Class AAA Norfolk on a rehabilitation assignment. He knew he was ready to return after playing a 14-inning game on artificial turf last week with no pain.</p>
        <p>Now that Hamilton is back, Manager Bobby Valentine has to figure out how to use him.</p>
        <p>''Who knows?'' Valentine said of his plans. ''I can't look into the future. Just try to have good players playing every night. That's the idea of this whole thing. I don't know if it's at a cost to guys. I'd think that he would get time because that's what he deserves and that's what's good for the team. I don't consider this a deposit and withdrawal system. It's a team.''</p>
        <p>But the return of Hamilton left Franco without a team -- for the moment. The Mets have 7 to 10 days to release him, trade him or send him outright to the minors, and General Manager Steve Phillips said he would not release Franco. While Franco works out on his own in New York, Phillips could be exploring trade options before trying to pass Franco through outright waivers to Norfolk.</p>
        <p>''It'd be tough for me to say that I want to get claimed off waivers,'' Franco said Tuesday night. ''I love the guys and I love New York. On the other hand, if I get an opportunity to play or get a better situation for me, that might be better for me.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton met with Valentine before tonight's game and said he understood and accepted that he can not expect to displace a starter just because he is healthy again. Valentine also plans to meet with the Mets' other outfielders.</p>
        <p>''You can't really downplay what me and Jay have done,'' Agbayani said.</p>
        <p>Agbayani is hitting .317; Payton .293. Hamilton recognizes that and said he would be happy helping the team any way he can.</p>
        <p>''As an athlete, we always talk about putting the team first,'' Hamilton said. ''The main goal is always winning. If you guys don't believe I'm on that plane, then you'll find out now.''</p>
