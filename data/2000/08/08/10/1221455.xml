        <p>Max Heller had been mayor of Greenville, S.C., for seven years when he decided to run for Congress in 1978 and discovered the limits of religious tolerance in the South of the post-civil rights era.</p>
        <p>One of his opponents for the office, Don Sprouse, said Mr. Heller should not be elected because he was Jewish and did not ''believe Jesus Christ has come yet.'' Another opponent, Carroll Campbell, who later became governor, conducted a poll with the assistance of the consultant Lee Atwater that reminded voters that Mr. Heller was a ''Jewish immigrant.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Heller lost that race, and never ran for office again. But now, as he contemplated with pleasure the selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as the first Jewish member of a national political ticket, he said he believed his adoptive region had moved far beyond its earlier distrust of non-Christian candidates.</p>
        <p>''The South has grown up,'' said Mr. Heller, 81, who was born in Vienna. ''So much of the old anti-Semitism is gone now, with all the new people who've moved in. If the candidate is someone like Joe Lieberman who is faithful to his religion, I don't think he would have any problem in the South anymore.''</p>
        <p>With the exception of Florida, which is 4.3 percent Jewish, Vice President Al Gore was probably not expecting to convert any Southern states to his column with the selection of Mr. Lieberman. But both Jewish and non-Jewish leaders in the South agreed that the presence of an Orthodox Jew on the ticket was no longer a liability in the nation's most religiously conservative region.</p>
        <p>Ken Guin, the majority leader of the Alabama House of Representatives, said he had spent two days going to coffee shops and restaurants in the Birmingham area to gauge reaction to the announcement, and had not even heard a murmur of discontent.</p>
        <p>''I don't get the sense that his religion is going to make any difference in the race,'' said Mr. Guin, a Democrat from Carbon Hill, who is a leader of his Methodist church. ''In fact, his being devout in his faith may even be a benefit in the South. This is a place where people take religion very seriously, and they like to see others take it seriously, too.''</p>
        <p>Of course, Alabama, like most of the Southern states, is still expected to vote heavily for Gov. George W. Bush, and Mr. Guin was not predicting any change. At the moment, Mr. Gore is thought to be a contender only in Florida, Tennessee and possibly Georgia. But Mr. Guin said Mr. Gore might actually improve his chances in Alabama by bringing Mr. Lieberman there a few times and campaigning hard.</p>
        <p>There have been examples in recent years of Jewish political candidates in the South whose opponents have made an issue of their religion. In 1996, John Mitnick, a Republican, tried to unseat Representative Cynthia A. McKinney in Atlanta, and was accused by Ms. McKinney's father, Billy, of being a ''racist Jew.'' A campaign flier said Mr. Mitnick was a member of several Jewish groups. Mr. McKinney later resigned from his daughter's campaign and apologized for his comments. (Mr. Mitnick lost a race for the State Senate on Tuesday.)</p>
        <p>On Monday, Lee Alcorn, the president of the Dallas chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., questioned Mr. Lieberman's selection in a manner that angered many listeners. ''I think we need to be very suspicious of any kind of partnerships between the Jews at that kind of level because we know that their interest primarily has to do with money and these kind of things,'' Mr. Alcorn said on a radio show. The national president of the N.A.A.C.P., Kweisi Mfume, condemned the remarks as repulsive and anti-Semitic and formally suspended Mr. Alcorn from his post.  After his suspension, Mr. Alcorn angrily resigned from the organization.</p>
        <p>There are undoubtedly silent sentiments of anti-Semitism that persist in the small rural towns, inner cities and gated suburbs of the South, but  public incidents remain rare. In recent years, there have been repeated examples of Jewish officeholders elected by Southern districts with only a handful of Jewish voters. Ben Erdreich, a Democrat, represented the Birmingham area in Congress for five terms in the 1980's and early 90's; Martin Frost, a Democrat, has represented a Dallas-area Congressional district since 1978; Virginia is likely to have two Jewish congressmen in November.</p>
        <p>Alabama's governor, Don Siegelman, is Catholic, but his wife and children are Jewish.</p>
        <p>''The South has grown more tolerant as it has grown more prosperous,'' said Hastings Wyman, editor of the Southern Political Report, a newsletter published every two weeks in Washington. ''The education systems are better, the universities are better funded, and people are less defensive than they used to be. And we've got all these Yankees here, now that we've got air-conditioning.''</p>
        <p>In 1990, according to the National Jewish Population Survey, about 21 percent of the country's core Jewish population lived in the South, a number that has probably grown in the last decade. But the region actually has a much lower percentage of anti-Semitic incidents, according to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which reported recently that only 12 percent of such incidents in 1999 occurred in the 12 states of the Southeast region. The majority of the incidents, 58 percent, occurred in the Northeast, the group said, with 21 percent in the West and 8 percent in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>''The South actually has a better track record than other parts of the country,'' said Jay Kaiman, the Southeast regional director of the league, based in Atlanta. ''We've got fringe groups here, of course, and you never really know what kind of talk goes on in country clubs or in the backrooms of workplaces. But I think when it comes to voting, being Jewish is a nonissue.''</p>
        <p>Which does not mean there will not be some suspicion of Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>''His biggest problem here won't be that he's Jewish,'' Mr. Kaiman said. ''It's that he's a Northerner.''</p>
