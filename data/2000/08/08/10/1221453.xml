        <p>As Verizon Communications prepares to enter its fifth day of bargaining with its striking unions, the question arises: Has Verizon received more than it bargained for with this strike?</p>
        <p>The walkout by 86,000 workers of Verizon, the nation's largest telecommunications employer, has developed into one of the largest and most unruly strikes in years, raising questions about the company's preparation for the contract talks and its handling of the walkout.</p>
        <p>Management was distracted for the first six months of the year by the completion of the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, which created the newly named Verizon. And then the company was eager to embark on a huge advertising and promotional campaign to establish the new Verizon brand. Did those distractions lead the company's management to underestimate the unions' intent to transform the Aug. 5 contract deadline into a point of reference for organized labor's future in high-technology companies?</p>
        <p>''I think there probably was a certain amount of arrogance here on management's part,'' said Neil Bernstein, a professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis who also works as a labor arbitrator. ''Telephone companies have generally not been overly concerned about strikes, mainly because their services are so automated.''</p>
        <p>The company denies that it underestimated the challenge of reaching a new contract. ''No company ever wants a strike, and we most certainly did everything we could to prevent one,'' said Eric Rabe, Verizon's spokesman. ''Sometimes it's just necessary to get eyeball to eyeball on issues.''</p>
        <p>Instead of a token walkout like the two-day strike by Bell Atlantic's unions two years ago, Verizon has received a mounting public relations problem.</p>
        <p>The company's customers in the 12 Eastern states and Washington, where the strike is taking place, are unable to reach directory assistance. And regionwide, requests for repairs have swelled to 82,000, compared with 36,000 at this time last month.</p>
        <p>Negotiations between Verizon and the two unions representing its employees, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, deteriorated yesterday, reducing  chances for a quick resolution, according to people close to the talks.</p>
        <p>And on the picket lines, tension has increased between management and strikers. The unions said yesterday  that nine picketers had been hit by managers' vehicles in separate incidents, but that none were hospitalized. Verizon said that union members had thrown bottles, rocks and eggs at managers trying to enter company buildings.</p>
        <p>So far, 24 union members throughout the region have been arrested during the strike, according to the company.</p>
        <p>A profit warning from the company on Tuesday sent shares in Verizon down more than 12 percent, and yesterday they fell an additional 3.7 percent, to $40.50 a share. Since June, shares in Verizon, the nation's largest provider of local telephone and wireless service, have fallen nearly 30 percent, to a two-year low.</p>
        <p>The company's woes come amid a nationwide advertising campaign that began on Aug. 1, using actors including James Earl Jones to make people more aware of the new name, which is pronounced vah-RISE-un.  And even as chances of a strike mounted before the deadline of 12:01 a.m. last Sunday set by the union,  Verizon chose to proceed with its advertising plans.</p>
        <p>''This is clearly not the association you want to build as you launch a new brand,'' said Martin Tipping, director of naming at Landor Associates, a corporate identity consulting company. ''At least people are learning how to pronounce the name.''</p>
        <p>According to people involved in the talks, an indication of Verizon's handling of the negotiations came in the minutes leading up to the deadline. Only then did Verizon make concessions to one of the unions' main demands, which would allow them to organize in the company's fast-growing wireless division.</p>
        <p>By that time, though, it was too late to avoid a strike. While Verizon had also made wage and benefit concessions that the unions found satisfactory, other issues remained stumbling blocks. They included the use of nonunion contractors and the relocation of some work in response to the merger or changing corporate priorities.</p>
        <p>Labor experts say it appears Verizon did not correctly gauge the unions' readiness to turn the strike opportunity into a sounding board for labor's place in the new economy.</p>
        <p>''This strike is pivotal because the unions are confronting changes produced by rapid technological advances,'' said Richard Hurd, professor of labor issues at Cornell University.</p>
        <p>The unions are not emerging from the strike with their image unscathed. One union member was arrested today for harrassing a Verizon manager at a company building in Manhattan. And the New York City Police Department has been investigating the possibility that strikers have been involved in numerous acts of vandalism that have knocked out telephone service in some parts of the city.</p>
        <p>In Manhattan yesterday, five police officers from the Midtown South Precinct who were monitoring picket lines were doused with bird excrement and other waste dumped from the top of Verizon's 41-story headquarters building on the Avenue of the Americas at 42nd Street.</p>
        <p>The officers were taken to Bellevue Hospital and treated for exposure to animal feces.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to rule out management or strikers,'' said Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a spokesman for the police department.</p>
