        <p>In his first solo campaign swing as the Republican vice presidential candidate, Dick Cheney took his ticket's message of ''compassionate conservatism'' to a homeless shelter here today, and promised that a Bush administration would expand federal support for religious-based social service groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney also muffled his attacks on Vice President Al Gore by praising his choice for a running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''He's a good man, well qualified for the post,'' Mr. Cheney told reporters. ''Everything I know about the guy is positive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's Jewish faith should have no effect on the race, Mr. Cheney said. ''I don't think it's an issue,'' he said. ''I think the country is far beyond any kind of religious-based bigotry.''</p>
        <p>Still buoyant from a three-day rail trip with Gov. George W. Bush across key battleground states last weekend, Mr. Cheney and his wife, Lynne, picked Sunshine Ministries, a century-old soup kitchen that now also counsels drug and alcohol abusers and provides after-school classes for poor children, as their first stump stop away from Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney said that he would emphasize Mr. Bush's campaign themes -- education, Social Security, tax reform and rebuilding the military -- in a trip through swing states, including Ohio and Kentucky.</p>
        <p>Inside the mission's brick building,  surrounded by rubble-strewn empty lots a short distance from this city's glistening signature arch, Mr. and Mrs. Cheney met with several of the youngsters who attend after-school programs that teach fellowship and practical skills. Mrs. Cheney eagerly greeted each teenager by name, but Mr. Cheney seemed less comfortable in the glare of jostling television crews. When Felicia Hollis, 14, stumbled a bit explaining her goal to be a prosecutor, Mr. Cheney said, ''The cameras make me nervous, too.''</p>
        <p>The mission runs a 45-person shelter, offers food, clothing and job training to 300 families in four nearby federal housing projects and provides classes for 200 children after school, said Carol Clarkson, the ministries' associate director.</p>
        <p>The mission receives its entire $2 million annual budget from private contributions, Ms. Clarkson said, and symbolizes the kind of nongovernmental, community-rooted approach to social services and education that is a hallmark of the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>''One of the great things about organizations like Sunshine Ministries is it demonstrates that government doesn't have a monopoly on the wisdom of how to deal with society's problems,'' Mr. Cheney said.</p>
        <p>''Right now, only three federal social service programs allow religious organizations to apply for funding on the same basis as other providers,'' he said. ''Governor Bush and I believe faith-based groups, whether Mormon or Methodist or Muslim, ought to be eligible for public money to advance their good work.''</p>
        <p>If elected this fall, Mr. Cheney said, a Bush administration would expand the federal charitable deductions for 80 million taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions, swelling the resources available to groups like Sunshine Ministries.</p>
        <p>A Bush administration would also broaden federal support for after-school programs. ''After school programs are vital in terms of reducing drug use, teen pregnancy and criminal behavior by providing young people things to do and places to be,'' Mr. Cheney said.</p>
        <p>When asked later how these pledges contrasted with a 10-year voting record in the House that included opposing the Head Start education program, Mr. Cheney sidestepped the question, saying that it ''probably squares as well as Joe Lieberman's voting record with Al Gore's.''</p>
        <p>That response offered a glimpse into what is likely to be a Republican refrain from now until the election.  ''I think it's going to be tough for Al Gore to be as aggressively negative on some of Governor Bush's ideas which his own running mate supports, like school vouchers and ballistic missile defense,'' Mr. Cheney said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cheney said the contrasts between the running mates would stand out, including his tenure as White House chief of staff under President Gerald R. Ford and secretary of defense under President George Bush.</p>
        <p>''We're clearly products of our experiences,'' Mr. Cheney told reporters. ''I've got a lot of experience in the White House and Defense Department. Joe's background has a stronger legal dimension, as an attorney and attorney general.''</p>
