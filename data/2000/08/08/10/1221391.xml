        <p>Subterranean Attacks</p>
        <p>Q.  The autumn before last, I planted about 50 English bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) and 25 crocuses on our wooded property in Massachusetts. A few of the bluebells came up and none of the crocuses. Last autumn, I planted 200 bluebells and 50 daffodils. The daffodils came up, but not the bluebells. It is very discouraging; I would very much like to have a bluebell woods. I suspect rodent damage. Is there a solution?</p>

        <p>Subterranean Attacks</p>
        <p>Q.  The autumn before last, I planted about 50 English bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) and 25 crocuses on our wooded property in Massachusetts. A few of the bluebells came up and none of the crocuses. Last autumn, I planted 200 bluebells and 50 daffodils. The daffodils came up, but not the bluebells. It is very discouraging; I would very much like to have a bluebell woods. I suspect rodent damage. Is there a solution?</p>
        <p>A.  Oh, to be in England, where having a bluebell woods is easy, once you have the woods, and where the delicate, fragrant H. non-scripta is the bluebell you get to have.</p>
        <p>Taller and scentless, but otherwise similar, Spanish bluebells (H. hispanica) are more common in the United States. Though both species are widely sold in this country, anecdotal evidence suggests the Spanish ones are more likely to thrive. Cold winters and hot summers both discourage the British from colonizing.</p>
        <p>But it sounds as though yours never had a chance to get discouraged. The soil may be too wet; most bulbs need good drainage. Alternatively, as you suspect, something may be eating them. If so, the something is probably voles, which adore crocuses and are impossible to get rid of on a woods-wide scale.</p>
        <p>The best way to find out what's wrong and what to do about it is to conduct a simple study. Plant some of each species three ways: without protection, and also protected from voles by the two methods discussed below. Plant them four or five inches deep, the groups close enough so that they're growing in more or less the same soil. Be sure to make above-ground labels.</p>
        <p>Protection Method 1: Coat the bulbs with an animal repellent like Ro-Pel or Deer-Off. (Wearing rubber gloves, put them in a bucket, and get them thoroughly covered; let dry before planting, and wear the gloves for that, too.) These repellents work well, but only in the first year.</p>
        <p>Protection Method 2: Plant each bulb surrounded on all sides by a quantity of tooth-defying gravel. A gravel vole barrier doesn't work as well as repellents, but it lasts several years.</p>
        <p>Next spring, make note of what comes up. If it's nothing at all, your problem is probably the soil. If you get bluebells, notice which group or groups they belong to, and plant accordingly.</p>
        <p>Buzz Busters</p>
        <p>Q.  Are the battery-operated mosquito repellent gadgets effective? The ads say they work by emitting sounds made by mosquitoes' enemies, but I don't know if I believe it.</p>
        <p>A.  Numerous scientific studies have failed to find any use for these things, and extensive nonscientific field tests have also been performed by my husband, an avid fisherman who frequents mosquito-infested places. Our conclusion is that the only thing they repel are human beings driven mad by their high-pitched whine.</p>
        <p>The most effective protection is provided by DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), the active ingredient in most chemical-based repellents. It is usually harmless if used as directed, but it can be hazardous, especially to children, and particularly if overused.</p>
        <p>DEET is absorbed through the skin, so one way to avoid problems is to put it on your clothes instead. Choose an outfit for gardening: shirt, pants, socks, hat or kerchief, and  gloves. Spray lightly with a product that contains a high concentration of DEET, and let dry before donning. Store in a plastic bag between wearings.</p>

        <p>Correction:  August 31, 2000, Thursday  A report in the Q.&amp;A. column of Aug. 10 about mosquito repellants misstated the Internet address for a paper published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. It is:</p>
