        <p>The Ford Motor Company announced today that it would offer computerized stability systems on all of its sport utility vehicles and pickups by the 2005 model year, to improve the handling of the tall vehicles and reduce the frequency of rollovers.</p>
        <p>But the systems will be optional on many of these models, meaning that customers who want them will have to pay extra. Ford currently charges $725 for the option on its $33,000 Lincoln LS sports sedan.</p>

        <p>The Ford Motor Company announced today that it would offer computerized stability systems on all of its sport utility vehicles and pickups by the 2005 model year, to improve the handling of the tall vehicles and reduce the frequency of rollovers.</p>
        <p>But the systems will be optional on many of these models, meaning that customers who want them will have to pay extra. Ford currently charges $725 for the option on its $33,000 Lincoln LS sports sedan.</p>
        <p>The expensive suspension systems, which automatically apply the brakes slightly to one or more wheels to prevent them from slipping, are currently available only on a few luxury models, like the Lincoln LS sedan and the Mercedes ML320 sport utility vehicle. But safety experts have been calling for automakers to make them more widely available.</p>
        <p>Martin Inglis, Ford's vice president for North American automotive operations, said the move was independent of the recall today by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. of millions of tires, the majority on Ford Explorer sport utilities. He announced the plan at the auto industry's annual summer meeting, organized by the University of Michigan and held here in northwestern Michigan.</p>
        <p>General Motors responded by saying that the Cadillac Escalade full-sized sport utility vehicle will have the stability system as standard equipment starting this fall.</p>
        <p>Stability systems allow even fairly tall, heavy vehicles to be driven with agility around obstacles that can cause crashes, like debris in the road, other vehicles, animals or pedestrians. Continental A.G., a big German manufacturer of tires and brakes, was recently the host of a demonstration of the technology in the suburbs of Detroit. When reporters drove the Mercedes sport utility through a slalom course of cones meant to simulate a swerve around an obstacle in the road, the sport utility tipped up on two wheels when going a little more than 30 miles an hour with the stability system disengaged. But when the system was engaged, all four wheels stayed on the ground.</p>
