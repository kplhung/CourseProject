        <p>STUDENTS in the freshman class of 2000 were born at the same time as the original I.B.M. PC. They have never known a world without microprocessors. They grew up with cable TV and Nintendo, learned to program the VCR before they could ride a bike, became virtuosos with call-waiting and three-way conference calling and took for granted answering machines, microwave ovens, audio CD's, pagers, fax machines and cell phones. They came of age with the Internet and the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>Now they are heading off to college, where they will be immersed in technology more deeply than at any time of their young lives.</p>
        <p>As if to prove that the cosmos has a sense of humor, we, their technologically befuddled parents, are supposed to choose a computer for these children of the technology age as they head off to college. Here are some data points that may help.</p>
        <p>Nine out of 10 college students will be connected to the Internet when classes start in a few weeks, according to Jupiter Communications, a research firm. By the time this year's freshmen are seniors, the number will rise to 95 percent, Jupiter says.</p>
        <p>Those numbers are actually a bit low compared with those at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where every one of the estimated 3,500 freshmen will be required to own a laptop computer this fall.</p>
        <p>North Carolina is unusual in both the size and ambition of its computer program for new students, but the reasons behind its laptop initiative could be instructive for any parent or student who is thinking about computing strategies for the coming school year.</p>
        <p>As in years past, this column strongly advises that all new students check first with the admissions office to find out about the college's computer recommendations. Doing so can save money, time and frustration.</p>
        <p>Let's start with North Carolina's decision to require students to have not just any computer, but specifically a laptop or notebook computer.</p>
        <p>Laptop computers are more expensive, less powerful, less versatile and easier to damage and lose than desktop computers. So why did North Carolina decide to require students to go mobile?</p>
        <p>''Desktops are dead, but nobody has taken their pulse lately,'' said Marian Moore, vice chancellor for information technology.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moore said the university decided two years ago to begin the transition to mobile computing on its campuses. ''We are absolutely positioned to drive local wireless networks into the classrooms, the public areas on campus, the dining halls and out into open areas, because we know every student will have a laptop,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Going to a wireless campus gives faculty and administrators greater flexibility in using classroom space, costs less than trying to string wires through old buildings and enables students -- virtually the only people on campus who do not have their own offices -- to work wherever they are, either inside or while sitting under a tree.</p>
        <p>North Carolina is just beginning to develop its wireless network and does not yet require students to have wireless modems for their laptops. Moving the entire student body to laptops is the first step in the transition to campuswide wireless networking.</p>
        <p>Just as mobile phones are overtaking wired phones, mobile computers will overtake desktop computers for all but specialized tasks. But wired networks are not dead yet. They will always offer higher connection speeds than wireless networks, which is important for such important college tasks as collaborating on engineering projects and downloading bootleg MP3 music files. Until wireless networks are fully deployed on campus, the laptops can tap into the wired networks through a standard Ethernet adapter card.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moore says that 85 percent of the new students will buy their laptops through the university. Because it buys so many computers, North Carolina was able to negotiate substantial discounts, as much as $800 less than the best prices available on the Internet. (To minimize profiteering through reselling, students and faculty members can buy only one computer each year.)</p>
        <p>In this case, the manufacturer was I.B.M., which makes the highly regarded and highly priced ThinkPad line of notebooks. There are less expensive laptops on the market, but North Carolina decided to go for the best machines available.</p>
        <p>''You get what you pay for,'' Ms. Moore said. ''If you're going to make the purchase, purchase something that will last.''</p>
        <p>Because North Carolina has adopted only two models -- the ThinkPad 600X and ThinkPad 820M laptops -- as its standard, it can offer expedited repair, replacement parts and loaner services right on campus. Students can rarely afford to be without a computer for a week or more, and the standardization allows the university to minimize downtime.</p>
        <p>To help make sure the computer does not drop out before the student graduates, the discounted price at North Carolina includes a four-year service and repair warranty, a one-year insurance policy against damage or theft, a cable lock for securely tethering the laptop to desks or other hard-to-move objects and a basic package of software.</p>
        <p>Extended warranties are even more important for laptop computers than they are for desktop machines. If the laptop screen is damaged, it can cost almost as much to repair as the cost of a new machine.</p>
        <p>Some homeowner insurance policies will cover the loss or theft of a child's laptop at college, but many will not. Supplemental coverage can be added. Or consider, as North Carolina chose to do, a company like Safeware (www.safeware.com), which specializes in coverage of computers.</p>
        <p>Kensington makes my favorite locking security cable for laptops (about $40). Targus (www.targus  .com) has a motion-sensing notebook alarm device called the Defcon 1 ($50) that shrieks louder than Marilyn Manson when somebody tries to steal a laptop or backpack.</p>
        <p>Even with the discounts, the ThinkPad 820M package will cost $2,200; the 600X package, $2,900. ''You can't expect to require a kid to come to school with technology like that without some financial aid commitment,'' Ms. Moore said.</p>
        <p>Depending on their financial status, some students will get laptops free, while others will get loans from the university. The money the school spends on financial aid, she said, will be offset by the money it saves by making the transition from wired to wireless buildings on campus.</p>
        <p>Finally, all new students get a two-hour computer orientation to learn how to tap in to the school's network, use e-mail and otherwise master the system.</p>
        <p>That's the story in Chapel Hill. Most undergraduate colleges stop short of making computer ownership a requirement, as North Carolina does, and simply urge students to have their own PC's. Many colleges make computers accessible in libraries and study centers for students who cannot afford to buy one.</p>
        <p>For those who are shopping for a desktop system, ''this is actually one of the best times in the last few years to buy a computer,'' said Stephen Baker, vice president of technology products research at PC Data in Reston, Va.</p>
        <p>''Prices aren't exactly collapsing,'' he continued, ''in fact, they're pretty flat from last year, but the consumer is getting a lot more for the same amount of money. We're seeing bigger hard drives, better and faster processors and preinstalled CD-RW drives.''</p>
        <p>Big hard drives and CD-RW drives are vitally important for managing large volumes of MP3 music files. (Yes, I know, there is more to college than downloading Napster files. Dude, whatever.) When shopping for a computer that will be used far from home, it is valuable to know which brands have the best reputations for reliability, service and support. Each year PC Magazine asks thousands of readers to rate their desktop and laptop computers and printers on the basis of reliability and service satisfaction.</p>
        <p>In this year's survey, published in June, the only desktop computer maker to get an A grade from readers was Dell. The lowest scores went to Acer, AST, Compaq and Packard Bell. Packard Bell has always been the class clown in terms of service and reliability, but Compaq's low score was surprising.</p>
        <p>In the notebook computer category the grading was tougher: No company scored an A. The highest scores, all B's, went to Dell, I.B.M. and Gateway. Again, Compaq scored a surprising D. In the printer category, PC Magazine readers gave A grades to Panasonic and Hewlett-Packard. Epson got a B. Canon got a D for its relatively weak support, and Tektronix a D for frequency of repairs.</p>
        <p>Handheld organizers like the Palms, Handspring Visor, HP Jornada and Compaq iPaq are not replacements for a desktop or laptop computer at school, but they can be useful for keeping track of assignments and taking notes, especially when equipped with a folding keyboard.</p>
        <p>And for extra credit, students, remember to turn off your cell phones before entering class.</p>
        <p>STATE OF THE ART  Correction:  August 14, 2000, Monday  The State of the Art column in Circuits on Thursday about purchasing a computer to take to college misstated the model number of an I.B.M. laptop being offered for sale to freshmen at the University of North Carolina. It is the ThinkPad A20M, not the 820M.</p>
