        <p>Gael Greene Ends Critic's Role</p>
        <p>After nearly 30 years of raving about restaurants -- or panning them -- GAEL GREENE is stepping down as the restaurant critic for New York magazine. She will stop reviewing restaurants next month, but will write longer articles about food and restaurants.</p>
        <p>''It felt like we were eating dinner out eight nights a week,'' said Ms. Greene, who wrote the magazine's first restaurant review in October 1968, a few issues after its debut. ''My life is going to be so different now. Having to go to the supermarket and buy something that's not breakfast. We've been spending about $60 a week. I went out to Fairway for a few things for lunch and dinner. It cost $75. It's going to be different not being able to entertain your friends seven nights a week and charge Mr. Kravis.'' (The financier HENRY R. KRAVIS is a principal in the company that owns New York magazine.)</p>
        <p>In her 30 years of table-hopping, Ms. Greene has gone from writing about traditional French restaurants like La Cote Basque to ''Mafia Guide to Dining Out'' and ''Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Ice Cream but Were Too Fat to Ask.''</p>
        <p>She said she had sought the change because she wanted to write longer articles and to do things that people who do not dine out all the time do.</p>
        <p>''Never got to shop, never got to dinner parties,'' she said. ''People think I can't cook. The only time I cook now is when I'm out of town. That was the thinking behind it: have a slightly more normal life, finish my children's book, finish my novel, clean up the closet, find a loft.''</p>
        <p>ADAM PLATT, who has reported on food and travel for Elle and Conde Nast Traveler magazines, is joining New York as Ms. Greene's successor and will alternate with HAL RUBENSTEIN, with whom Ms. Greene has had a three-months-on, three-months-off arrangement since 1997.</p>
        <p>Flowers and Tears For Gotti Daughter</p>
        <p>The author's husband can write, too, it turns out.</p>
        <p>At a party celebrating the publication of VICTORIA GOTTI's new novel, ''Superstar,'' SCOTT LEEMON read a letter from Ms. Gotti's husband, CARMINE AGNELLO. Mr. Leemon is Mr. Agnello's lawyer. Mr. Agnello, a scrap metal dealer, did not attend the party because he had a previous commitment at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he is being held on arson and racketeering charges. He was denied bail in June.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Agnello sent five dozen long-stemmed roses, as well as a good-luck card. And the letter.</p>
        <p>''People would say to me, 'Are you proud of your wife because she writes books?' '' Mr. Agnello wrote in the letter. He said the answer was yes, adding, ''You doing so well does not surprise me, because I know that you're great in everything you set out to do.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gotti disappeared, apparently for a good cry in the ladies' room.</p>
        <p>''I made a beeline to the bathroom,'' she said when she returned to the party about 10 minutes later. ''I'm very emotional, and they always say a lady never cries in public.'' The letter from her husband was a surprise, she said: ''I spoke to him right before I came, and he didn't say a word.''</p>
        <p>She said that she was working on book No. 5, about ''somebody dealing with terminal illness.''</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't lie,'' she said. ''It was prompted when my dad got ill.'' Her father is JOHN J. GOTTI, the former Gambino boss.</p>
        <p>''Even though I create fiction, you want a sense of realness,'' she said. ''Life is not always wine and roses.''</p>
        <p>2 Lucky Breaks</p>
        <p>It does pay to be in the right place at the right time. AARON FELSKE, 22, and PARKER ESSE, 24, are joining the cast of ''Fosse'' because they impressed ANN REIN KING last week at her Broadway Theater Project, a workshop for young actors in Tampa, Fla. Then came word that there were two openings in the cast of ''Fosse.'' Ms. Reinking told GORDON HARRELL, the music director of ''Fosse,'' that she had found her men. ''Two very fine dancers, very well trained, ready to go, mature and with a lot of skills,'' she said. ''And they both sing nicely.''</p>
