        <p>A federal appeals court ruling yesterday cleared the way for the sale of a generic version of Prozac, the world's top-selling antidepressant, as early as next summer, about two years earlier than expected.</p>

        <p>A federal appeals court ruling yesterday cleared the way for the sale of a generic version of Prozac, the world's top-selling antidepressant, as early as next summer, about two years earlier than expected.</p>
        <p>Eli Lilly, the maker of Prozac, said it would appeal the ruling, but the company's stock plunged $32.5625 yesterday, or 30 percent, to $76, as investors digested the news. Lilly sold $2.6 billion of Prozac last year, and the drug now makes up about 26 percent of Lilly's revenue.</p>
        <p>The ruling was good news for the 38 million people worldwide who have taken Prozac. The generic version could be priced at less than one-third the current price. A 30-day supply of Prozac now costs about $90 at a Duane Reade pharmacy in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>As for Barr Laboratories, the drugmaker that will sell the first generic version of Prozac, its stock rose $30.25 yesterday, or 66 percent, to $76.</p>
        <p>Bruce L. Downey, Barr's chairman and chief executive, predicted that the ruling would cause more generic drug companies to bring court challenges to the numerous patents that brand name drugmakers file to try to keep less-expensive generic versions of their drugs off the market.</p>
        <p>Efforts to extend the monopoly on a popular brand-name drug are common in the pharmaceutical industry and critical to companies' profitability. A patent gives a drug company the right to be the sole seller of a given drug for 20 years from the date the patent application is filed. But often the companies file numerous patent applications on different aspects of the same drug -- different uses of the drug, for example, or slightly different formulations -- to try to get even more years of exclusive sales.</p>
        <p>''We felt strongly that what they had a patent on was not patentable,'' Mr. Downey said. ''We kept the faith because we felt so strongly about it.''</p>
        <p>Barr first filed its patent challenge in April 1996. The company argued, in part, that Lilly held two patents on the same drug. Barr contended that one of Lilly's patents on Prozac, which expires in 2003, was a ''double patent'' and was not valid.</p>
        <p>In a pretrial hearing in January 1999, Federal District Judge Sarah Barker in Indianapolis dismissed that claim. But before the trial started, both Barr and Lilly agreed to take the case directly to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the appeals court reversed Judge Barker's decision. But the court upheld a second decision by Judge Barker that Lilly's patent expiring in August 2001 was valid. As a result, Barr can sell generic Prozac as early as next August.</p>
        <p>In a conference call yesterday, Lilly executives said that they expected  sales of Prozac to fall quickly in the second half of next year as people begin to buy the generic version.</p>
        <p>''This is not the outcome we had hoped for,'' said Sidney Taurel, chairman and chief executive of Lilly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taurel said that the company would appeal the decision, either to the federal appeals court that ruled yesterday or to the Supreme Court. But he said the company also has a contingency plan in place in case the appeal fails. That plan includes getting regulatory approval for two different versions of Prozac, both of which are patented: a once-a-week Prozac and a new version of Prozac, which is now being developed by Sepracor, a drug company based in Marlborough, Mass.</p>
        <p>Lilly also plans to begin selling Sarafem this month. Sarafem is the same as Prozac, but it will be marketed to women as a treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or severe premenstrual symptoms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taurel also said that other new drugs now in development -- including Zovant, a drug to treat blood infections, and Forteo, a treatment for osteoporosis -- will help offset any reduction in sales of Prozac. By late 2002, Lilly executives expect revenue to begin increasing again by 10 percent or more.</p>
        <p>In late June, Lilly's stock price  soared when research showed that Zovant was found to reduce deaths from septic infections.</p>
        <p>Based on its price-to-earning ratio , Lilly was the most expensive stock in the industry before yesterday's ruling.</p>
        <p>''This was completely unexpected,'' said Sergio Traversa, an analyst who covers drug stocks for ING Barings. He said that investors had been bidding up Lilly's stock because of the strong products in its development pipeline. Mr. Traversa said analysts had expected that Lilly would have time to get r-fluoxetine, the version of Prozac being developed by Sepracor, on the market before its Prozac patent expired.</p>
        <p>''Lilly will appeal,'' Mr. Traversa said, ''but they do not appear to be confident that they will be able to reverse the decision.''</p>
        <p>The court's ruling also caused the share prices of the makers of other antidepressives to fall. The stock of Forest Laboratories, the maker of Celexa, fell $26.875, to $87.625. Pfizer, the maker of Zoloft, fell $2.625, to $42.3125. Sepracor's share price also plunged, falling $23.375, to $106.125.</p>
