        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''5 Weeks to Alter the Course of Education in Young Lives'' (front page, Aug. 5):</p>
        <p>The academic progress that Greta Bouterse, the teacher in your article, has made with her diverse class of summer school students highlights the importance of a small class size to teaching and learning.</p>
        <p>A small class size -- there are 15 students in Ms. Bouterse's class -- has allowed the teacher to quickly learn the strengths and weaknesses of each child, to individualize the curriculum for each student and to devote the daily individual attention, praise and feedback that is important to student achievement.</p>
        <p>Those endeavors are intrinsically impossible for a teacher to accomplish in a significant fashion in a class of 30 or more students. Along with other crucial facets of education, the New York City Board of Education must work to make the average class size smaller to improve students' chances of success.</p>
