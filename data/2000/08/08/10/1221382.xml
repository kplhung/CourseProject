        <p>FOR people who become depressed when the days grow short, a condition called seasonal affective disorder, one treatment is to sit in front of bright light for an hour or more each day. But a common complaint of patients is that they do not have time to do that regularly.</p>
        <p>One solution is to have patients wear light visors, with either incandescent or white light-emitting diodes (L.E.D.'s) under the brims. That lets the patients move around while they get extra light, but some doctors question the effectiveness of the visors, saying the light exposure is inconsistent.</p>
        <p>One company, Enlightened Technologies Associates, based in Fairfax, Va. (www .etai.com), says it has developed special glasses, called Somnavue, that can deliver light therapy more effectively to people who need it. Light therapy is also used to help people with sleep disorders, jet lag and seasonal affective disorder.</p>
        <p>The glasses are attached by a fiber-optic  bundle to a Walkman-size box, worn on the belt or in a pocket, containing battery-powered L.E.D.'s. They produce light that goes through the fibers to the eyeglasses' frames, at the back of the ears. The light moves through the frame to six optical fibers that ring the middle of each lens. Each fiber is linked to its own red, green or  blue L.E.D., and they aim light at the pupil at angles that get light to the periphery of the retina without interfering with vision, or being obvious to other people.</p>
        <p>Light therapy is thought to be effective for conditions like seasonal affective disorder or jet lag because light is the most powerful environmental cue for setting the daily biological rhythms, called circadian rhythms, that affect things like hormone, sleep and mood cycles. Light exposure signals an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, a cluster of cells near the spot where the optic nerves cross. The brain sends information about light to the pineal gland, which is at the base of the brain and produces a hormone called melatonin, which helps regulate circadian rhythms.</p>
        <p>The amount of light a person is exposed to determines how much melatonin is released  from the pineal gland and carried through the bloodstream. The pineal's melatonin production peaks during the night; light drives melatonin levels down.</p>
        <p>A clock and a microprocessor in the Somnavue control box can be programmed to turn the lens light on and off at specified times of day, and the light intensity can be regulated.</p>
        <p>Enlightened Technologies received a research grant to develop the glasses from the National Institutes of Health. It has conducted several studies in the last couple of years with Columbia University and Northwestern University on Somnavue's effect in seasonal affective disorder and sleep disorders.</p>
        <p>In the winter of 1998-99, early prototypes of the glasses were used in a study conducted on patients with seasonal affective disorder at the Sleep Disorders Institute at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New  York. Dr. Gary K. Zammit, director of the institute, said the glasses had been tested on 17 people; 9 were exposed to high-intensity light and 8 were exposed to lower intensities.</p>
        <p>''What struck us was that even the low-intensity groups got better,'' Dr. Zammit said. ''It may have been a placebo, or that even low-intensity light had some biological effect. But by the third week, there was a statistical improvement in both groups.''</p>
        <p>The glasses send light toward the eyes even as the person wearing them moves, something that bright light boxes or light visors can't do.</p>
        <p>''The light boxes didn't provide the uniformity of exposure because people using them could just look away, and the light visors were only bringing light in from one direction and hitting the eye at an angle that  didn't allow for maximum exposure,'' Dr. Zammit said.</p>
        <p>Next winter, Dr. Zammit said, the Sleep Disorders Institute will study the effect of the glasses on patients' melatonin levels and  sleep and depression patterns.</p>
        <p>At Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, the glasses were tested  on older patients with sleep problems that made them wake up too early in the morning, before they had slept enough.</p>
        <p>Each patient wore the glasses for about two hours between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. at very high light levels, between 1,400 and 2,000 lux (brighter than most offices), for several weeks. The study concluded that the glasses did as good a job at helping people's sleep patterns as did putting patients in front of light boxes for their light therapy.</p>
        <p>With the glasses on, people could read or walk around, which they could not do when using a light box.</p>
        <p>''We know that light works, but it's so impractical that even patients who find it effective can't afford to sit for an hour in front of a light box,'' said Dr. Phyllis C. Zee, a neurology professor who is director of the sleep disorders program at Northwestern University Medical School. ''The advantage of these glasses is that they're more practical, and they're something more patients will be able to use.''</p>
        <p>Even though some of the prototype models did not fit some of the patients' faces  exactly, Dr. Zee said, the colored lights emitted by the lens fibers had a more soothing effect than the direct bright light of a light box.</p>
        <p>''They were much easier and soothing on the eyes,'' she said, ''because they had this  wonderful color spectrum.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldman said the glasses were also designed to treat jet lag. A person traveling from New York to England, for example, could arrive in England in the morning, avoid bright light for a few hours, then use the glasses for about three hours in the afternoon (morning in New York) to reset the biological clock to England's time, Dr. Goldman said.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Charmane Eastman, director of the Biological Rhythms Research Laboratory at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago, said that a single light treatment would be unlikely to shift someone's biological clock more than two or three hours.</p>
        <p>Enlightened Technologies is seeking the Food and Drug Administration's approval for Somnavue and talking to manufacturers about producing test models. Dr. Goldman said the company had recently received another grant from the National Institutes of Health to look at how the glasses might be used to track the slow eye movements that indicate fatigue. That would let researchers find out how tired people became while working late shifts in factories, for example.</p>
        <p>''The fiber can transmit light in both directions, so we could take the reflection from the eye and analyze that back in the control box,'' he said.</p>
