        <p>DAVID SEELER is a practical man. When the landscape architect needed 25,000 tons of fill to build a ha-ha, or hidden fence, down the road from his house here, he decided to give his wife a pond for her 55th birthday.</p>
        <p>''We have an expression around here,'' he said, watching the bulldozers mold the S-shaped quarter-acre pond taking shape behind the house. ''Moderation is for monks.''</p>
        <p>A ha-ha is a little landscape trick from 18th-century England: a sunken fence or ditch used to keep the cows at a picturesque distance from the manor house. The cows appeared to be grazing on the greensward, but a wide ditch kept them from trampling the lawn and mooing at the guests.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to the Hamptons, where for 30 years Mr. Seeler has run the Bayberry Nursery, a garden center in Amagansett, and shaped the land for its summer stars: Paul Simon, Ralph Lauren, Edward Albee, Helmut Lang, Alfonso Ossorio, and others less famous but even better at making money. And though Mr. Seeler's own homes (one here, one in Amagansett and one planned for a sand dune in Montauk) reflect a natural restraint and sensitivity to the land, his clients may want the scrub oak forest turned into a stroll garden.</p>
        <p>''I've been out here so long, I've seen a lot of my gardens ripped out by new owners,'' said Mr. Seeler, who is 58. ''Or many times, the gardens are consumed by the house, which is four times the size of the old one. That's a heartbreak.''</p>
        <p>He tells of an elderly couple who were talked into a $1.4 million expansion of a house ''to protect their investment.'' They told him, ''The architect talked us into it.'' He keeps asking clients who think they want a fabulous landscape, Who's going to mow, weed, spray, do the pool? ''They buy a summer retreat and then they're never alone,'' he said. They want it all anyway.</p>
        <p>''There's so much money around, people don't know what to do with it,'' he said. ''The amount of business I did my entire first year in 1970, I do now the first four days in April.''</p>
        <p>There's plenty of 18th-century park-building going on in the flat fields and scrub oak woods around here -- even for something as simple as a pool fence, that modern-day requirement to prevent accidental drowning. (A maddening regulation, really, when a whole ocean glints a few fields away,  crashing fenceless at the feet of little children. But you can't sue the ocean.)</p>
        <p>When his neighbor on Sagaponack Road needed a pool fence, Mr. Seeler built a berm, a kind of ha-ha in reverse. He brought in enough fill -- from his just-dug pond -- to raise an earthwork around the house and pool. Then he buttressed it with a stone wall. And voila, wandering children, like cows, are kept out.</p>
        <p>''And now you can look straight out, forever,'' Mr. Seeler said, standing on his artificial plateau and sweeping his arm toward the wildflower meadow his wife, Ngaere (pronounced NYE-ree) Macray, planted a few years ago.</p>
        <p>She's the one who got a pond in return. It backs on the Sagg Swamp Nature Preserve, so nearby nesting herons can wade in the shallow waters, which deepen to seven feet in the center. Ms. Macray bought the property 20 years ago, with her first husband, Arnold Zohn, when it was still 40 acres of potatoes.</p>
        <p>''I wanted a house that felt like an 18th-century farm,'' she said. ''Something that was added onto, like the old farmhouses were, as people's needs grew. If you forgot something -- for the horse, the dog, the parakeet -- you just added it on.''</p>
        <p>Eugene L. Futterman, the architect who had the rare ability to suspend his ego and draw someone else's dream, built the house before his death in 1987; Mr. Seeler laid out the gardens.</p>
        <p>''He gave me the elevations and the spaces,'' said Ms. Macray, who grew up in England, in gardens with ''bones,'' or architectural elements that flow. Here the bones show in  garden rooms at pleasingly different levels, including one made of clipped beech and empty except for a bench.</p>
        <p>They planted a giant oval of beech trees, started by Ms. Macray from sprouted beechnuts sent through the mail by her English mother.</p>
        <p>''As the trees grow up, their branches will meet to form a cathedral,'' Ms. Macray said, standing inside the grassy nave, where her beloved dogs and cats are buried and where she and Mr. Seeler want their ashes scattered.</p>
        <p>Come summer, they rent out their Sagaponack house and move into cooler, calmer quarters behind Bayberry Nursery. Mr. Seeler grew up in Huntington, with summers on West Gilgo Beach, and never got the sand out of his shoes. So after earning a master's degree in landscape architecture from the University of Georgia, and working for six years, he came out to Amagansett, bought the nursery in 1971, and two years later, eight acres of land for $59,000.</p>
        <p>The land had been stripped of its topsoil, so he rebuilt the soil with tons of compost. That barren wasteland is now the Disney-like show grounds for wealthy clients, who can look at baby-elephant garden ornaments ($2,700) and 10-ton, $36,000 beech trees, or rest themselves on an Adirondack chair (only $140) by the quarter-acre pond Mr. Seeler built for clients who need to sit down while they add up their costs for landscaping.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people use this like a public park,'' Mr. Seeler said, flopping into a chair to eat his lunch. ''I've always wanted a garden center that was more garden than center.''</p>
        <p>That may be stretching it a bit, but there are some beautiful specimens here, like the eight-foot, 75-year-old  Hinoki cypress that has grown only two feet in 25 years. ''I'm going to will that to Longwood Gardens when I die,'' Mr. Seeler said, referring to the showplace created by Pierre S. du Pont in southeastern Pennsylvania. And you can get lots of ideas, like growing grapevines with real grapes up a whimsical dovecote made by the artist Michael Ince.</p>
        <p>Here is also where Mr. Seeler rejuvenates venerable old plants his clients tell him to haul off to the dump: like Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg's boxwoods, or a 45-year-old espaliered apple tree. Then he sells them to just the right person.</p>
        <p>Tucked behind the nursery is the Seeler-Macray summer home. Mr. Seeler replaced the flat roof of the one-story house with a tall, swooping Thai-like roof, with a four-foot overhang that allows them to keep the windows open in the rain (to hear it, smell it, feel a breeze). It also shades the house in summer.</p>
        <p>Glass doors to the bedroom and open living room offer views on one side of a simple courtyard and pool, and on the other of a secluded meadow, punctuated by a few large native cedars.</p>
        <p>''How many rooms do you need?'' Mr. Seeler said, showing how the two-sided fireplace serves both the great room and the bedroom. In the morning, he rolls out of bed into his Zen-like courtyard for a swim.</p>
        <p>MR. SEELER tries to bring this light touch to the gardens he designs for his clients. ''I try to find out what their dream is,'' he said. ''It can be a pond. A super garden. The play area they never had as a child.'' Then again, ''some people have no dream,'' he said. ''They just want it decorated.''</p>
        <p>There is a manicured, parklike quality to many of the gardens, perhaps because the plants are set in place all at once, rather than evolving through the years. Sometimes, the best Mr. Seeler can do is to save people from themselves.</p>
        <p>His favorite jobs have been for clients who are sensitive to the land, or to the spirit of an old house like Pudding Hall, the turn-of-the-century dinosaur on the corner of Main Street and Woods Lane in East Hampton. The monster of gables and shingles used to command a view of the town pond, from an estate twice its present size, full of towering beeches and cryptomeria.</p>
        <p>Built in 1886 for the founder of the Maidstone Club in East Hampton, the house was a wreck when the new owners bought it two years ago. There was blue vinyl over the leaky roof and trees were sorely neglected.</p>
        <p>As the house was restored, Mr. Seeler developed a Victorian landscape to go with it. Taking his cues from the great old surviving trees, he practiced the ''less is more'' principle. He left a sprawling old juniper lounging over the front lawn, and planted a hedge on the other side with the Kennedy-Schlossberg born-again boxwoods (they had spent six years at Bayberry recuperating).</p>
        <p>He planted a hedge of holly and a little grove of cryptomeria to match the old ones on Woods Lane, and edged the northern dark side of the house with white Annabelle hydrangeas. A perennial garden spills over with blue Nikko and white Peegee hydrangeas, Anthony Waterer spireas and burning bush.</p>
        <p>''All period old East Hampton plants,'' Mr. Seeler said. ''At these old houses, you only find things that flowered during 'the season.' ''</p>
        <p>He left a few old cedars, covered with ivy and porcelain vine, to avoid looking too manicured.</p>
        <p>Some clients, like the real estate agent Tina Fredericks, have spent a lifetime honing a dream. Her house, on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, rises like a lighthouse out of the briar patch. She bought the land 25 years ago, when she realized she was selling property to everyone but herself. She made paths through the wild bayberry and shadblow to a little bench facing the pond. ''I wanted to build a Japanese teahouse, but the town doesn't allow an accessory structure without a house,'' she said. So finally, working with a young designer, Kenton van Boer, she built two towers, all cedar shingles and glass, that rise like trees out of a sloping foundation of stone.</p>
        <p>''Ideally, if you could drop a house down from a helicopter, you wouldn't have to wreck the natural landscape,'' Mr. Seeler said. But this house wasn't dropped. So he has had to use a little theater, attaching dead bittersweet vines, as thick as a wrist, along the new rock walls as a natural trellis for wisteria. He yanked a mature climbing hydrangea off a Bayberry wall and used that and the recycled, espaliered apple tree to give the new walls an old look. He planted native witch hazel, viburnums and native azaleas to draw nature back up to the house.</p>
        <p>On another part of Georgica Pond he demolished much of the natural woods to put in a pool, complete with a carved rosewood Indian pavilion, for a Wall Street broker and his wife. Then his crew spent three years turning five acres of scrub oak into a woodland park, full of exotic plants, grassy paths and a quiet pond.</p>
        <p>''They had been mulling over what to do with their house,'' Mr. Seeler said, nodding toward the simple wooden summer house, built in 1900. ''So I suggested they start with the pool and the gardens and sort of work backward.'' They got the gardening bug, he said, and ''realized they didn't need a great room and all those things people think they need.''</p>
        <p>Now, the couple have moved to England and put the property up for sale. ''For $10.2 million,'' Mr. Seeler said. ''That shocks me.''</p>
        <p>Here's my dream. That the new owner wants a scrub oak woods full of bayberry, cedar and blueberry, and that Mr. Seeler hauls all those blue hydrangeas and the Indian pavilion back to Bayberry Nursery.</p>
