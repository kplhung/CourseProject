        <p>When Congress abolished welfare as a permanent safety net four years ago, there were alarming predictions about the prospect of an already overwhelmed foster care system's being flooded by a new wave of abused children. But according to the early findings of two studies, the changes do not appear to have had  such dire effects across the country.</p>
        <p>Confirmed cases of child abuse and neglect have fallen since 1996, the researchers involved in the studies say. Their conclusions are confirmed by federal statistics released yesterday reporting that there were 903,000 cases of child maltreatment in 1998, compared with 969,000 in 1996 and 1,019,000 in the peak year of 1993.</p>
        <p>One study notes, too, that while data is limited, the number of children entering foster care has been stable or falling slightly in recent years, continuing the national decline that began slightly more than five years ago, after the worst period of crack cocaine addiction. In 1999, 3.30 children out of every 1,000 entered foster care, according to one study, down from 3.87 in 1994.</p>
        <p>Perhaps no other forecast to stem from the 1996 welfare overhaul was as chilling as the predictions regarding foster care. At the time, some advocates for the poor and child welfare officials feared that the stress of losing benefits or the pressures of having to work for a welfare check would lead to a rise in child abuse and neglect.</p>
        <p>But the latest findings suggest that since President Clinton signed the 1996 legislation placing strict time limits and work obligations on much of the country's welfare recipients, their children do not seem to have flooded into foster care.</p>
        <p>That somewhat heartening picture comes at a time when children's overall well-being has improved slightly. Child poverty, infant mortality and birth rates for teenagers declined noticeably in the 1990's, a study released last month by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics found.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the picture is entirely rosy, but there is little evidence, if any, to suggest that there's a large population negatively affected,'' said Rob Geen, a senior research associate with the Urban Institute, a research organization based in Washington that is conducting a study of the impact of the welfare changes.</p>
        <p>Researchers and policy analysts caution, however, that certain states and certain families show signs of trouble that deserve closer attention. There are, after all, many much less blunt ways of measuring possible damage to children other than foster care admissions -- from health conditions to juvenile delinquency.</p>
        <p>''The concerns come in when you speak to individual workers and hear stories about specific families that have been affected by welfare reform,'' Mr. Geen said. ''There are many of them, but they are not large enough or well documented enough to show up in the aggregate numbers.''</p>
        <p>The full and lasting impact of welfare changes on children and family well-being will most likely play out over the next several years, because different states are on different schedules for putting the law's changes into effect.</p>
        <p>Some states imposed work requirements or time limits on welfare recipients before the 1996 federal laws took effect. In other states, time limits have not kicked in. Officials with the Urban Institute, as well as those with the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago, who have conducted a study of welfare families in Illinois, consequently warn that the snapshot they have so far developed is an early one.</p>
        <p>For now, even if the most dire predictions do not appear to have been realized, how much of that can be attributed to the success of an overhaul of welfare remains imprecise. Other trends -- chiefly, the general economic health of the country, declining rates of child poverty, and unrelated changes in child welfare policies -- could also be responsible. Nor is it clear what would have happened to foster care caseloads in the absence of changes in welfare.</p>
        <p>Some children, the researchers contend, may be getting by without welfare because their parents have found work. Some children who are being neglected may not show up on the radar of child welfare workers because their families are no longer on government assistance. Other at-risk families may be temporarily shielded by relatives and friends.</p>
        <p>In raising concerns that foster care systems would be burdened by an influx of vulnerable children, advocates noted that poverty is the greatest single ingredient in the mistreatment or neglect of children.  Many experts wondered, then, whether under a welfare overhaul  more children would land in foster care and whether more of them would languish there for longer because judges might be reluctant to return children to homes with empty pantries.</p>
        <p>''Nearly everyone we spoke with expected to see significant negative effects from welfare reform on child welfare,'' Mr. Geen said. ''There's no evidence to suggest that there has been a substantial impact.''</p>
        <p>He adds, however, that there is scattered evidence of trouble that merits close examination. In some states, like Michigan, child neglect reports based on lack of supervision have spiked sharply. Mr. Geen said state child welfare workers told him they believed that the increase reflected, in part, new welfare-to-work requirements, with mothers now having to leave their children unattended. But the increase, Mr. Geen said, could be due to other changes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Geen's report is based on aggregate data and interviews with 500 policymakers, welfare office workers, child welfare caseworkers, advocates and other experts in 12 states: Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>State by state figures will not be released until Mr. Geen's report is published later this year.</p>
        <p>In Michigan, New Jersey, Texas and Washington, the number of child abuse and neglect investigations increased significantly from 1996 through 1998, the most recent year for which figures are available. Mr. Geen said state officials attributed those increases not to welfare changes, but to other factors in child welfare policies, like changes in screening policies. He said the number of substantiated cases declined in all but one of the 12 states in that same period.</p>
        <p>In more than half of the 12, welfare workers filed more child neglect reports than in the past. But case workers who investigate those reports noted that many of the referrals were inappropriate, Mr. Geen said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Chapin Hall study similarly concluded that child welfare indicators had not taken a turn for the worse since the welfare law changed. Neither abuse and neglect reports, nor the number of children coming into foster care, has gone up in Illinois since 1996, it found.</p>
        <p>''That's not entirely due to the success of welfare reform,'' said Robert Goerge, associate director of Chapin Hall. ''We have a very strong economy and that generally results in fewer reports of abuse and neglect and fewer children going into foster care.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, Illinois embarked on a major overhaul of its child welfare system, seeking to get more children into permanent homes and trying to prevent children from coming into the formal foster care system.</p>
        <p>Therein lies the difficulty of understanding the impact of welfare policy changes on children's lives. The ebb and flow of foster care numbers is driven by everything from widely publicized incidents of child fatalities, like the Elisa Izquierdo case in New York City, which significantly drove up abuse reports, to crack cocaine addiction, which drove up foster care numbers to record levels in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>''We still don't have full information on whether requiring parents to go to work and threatening to cut off their aid actually improves the welfare of their children or prevents abuse and neglect,'' Mr. Goerge said. ''But it is certainly the case that welfare reform hasn't made things worse.''</p>
        <p>The number of families on welfare has dropped by 50 percent since 1993, to 2,453,000 in September 1999, according to figures released recently by the federal Department of Health and Human Services. So far, many single mothers on welfare have found jobs and have seen some increase in their income, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research organization in Washington. But since the new welfare laws took effect, the incomes of 1.8 million families have  declined, to $8,400 a year on average, compared with $8,760 in 1995. The center has not specifically inquired what has happened to their children.</p>
        <p>According to federal data, in New York State the welfare caseload has shrunk by one-third since 1993, to 279,692 families in September 1999, most of them in New York City. Of those who have left the rolls, city officials cannot say how many have found work. Nor is much known about the general well-being of their families, including their encounters with the city's child welfare agency.</p>
        <p>Those who are left on the rolls, some social policy analysts say, may be the ones who are the most ill-prepared to make it on their own. They may be impeded by mental illness or substance abuse, or they may be victims of domestic violence -- the same conditions that may also place their children at greater risk of abuse and neglect. Their prospects may not be discerned until a year or two from now.</p>
        <p>''People want to know the answers now,'' Mr. Geen said. ''But everyone we spoke to said, 'Please come back in two years and we'll have a different story to tell you.' ''</p>
