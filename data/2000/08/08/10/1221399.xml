        <p>For years, teachers have been matching their students with pen pals in foreign countries to encourage them to learn about other cultures. But language barriers have always been a huge hurdle for both teachers and students.</p>
        <p>Now ePals.com, an education Web site, is using translation technology to eliminate that problem. Students using the site, at www.epals.com, compose e-mail messages in their native languages and then click on a button for automatic translations. So far, the system lets students switch from English to one of a number of languages: French, German, Japanese, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, or from those languages to English. Several other combinations, like Spanish to Italian, are also possible. ''This is the Internet's first e-mail service with language translation available right within the Web browser,'' said Tim DiScipio, ePals.com's chief executive and co-founder.</p>

        <p>The site provides other tools, too, like a database of high schools that are interested in pairing (more than 65,000 classrooms in 182 countries are participating) and filtering software. By the fall, the service will also include materials from Scholastic.com, a large educational service that has formed a partnership with ePals.com to trade content and translation services.</p>
