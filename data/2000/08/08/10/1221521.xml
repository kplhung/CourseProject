        <p>The national Democratic leadership, clearly concerned that Hillary Rodham Clinton is facing a tough Senate race in New York, has mounted an unusually early effort to promote her candidacy. It has already channeled nearly $3 million into the state -- much of it from large, unregulated contributions -- and is girding to spend far more.</p>
        <p>No other Senate candidate in the country has received anywhere near as much financial assistance from either major political party, according to campaign finance records. The national Republican leadership has not yet spent money on behalf of Mrs. Clinton's opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, though it undoubtedly will do so.</p>
        <p>This infusion of money into New York by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee over the last 18 months reflects how rules intended to curb the role of big donations in such races have become increasingly ineffective. Often in league with Mrs. Clinton at events in New York and around the country, the committee has raised millions of dollars in largely unregulated contributions, known as soft money, some of which has found its way to New York.</p>
        <p>The committee sent $1.2 million in June to the New York State Democratic Committee, much of it soft money, to spend on Mrs. Clinton's behalf. The state party in turn bought more than $700,000 in television advertising attacking Mr. Lazio on his stance on a patients' bill of rights and prescription drug coverage for Medicare recipients.</p>
        <p>The state party spent an additional $43,500 to conduct focus groups on voters' views of Mrs. Clinton, hiring a firm in Washington State, Strategic Frameworking, that has also done extensive work for clients in the consumer products industry, including the National Confectioners Association and Kraft Singles processed cheese slices.</p>
        <p>And Mrs. Clinton is aggressively raising more of this money. President Clinton is to join her at a fund-raiser in Manhattan tonight at the home of John Catsimatidis, the Red Apple supermarket magnate who has been a major supporter of the Clintons. The president, who in the twilight of his tenure continues to be a formidable fund-raising draw, has routinely appeared at such events for Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>By relying on soft money to pay for advertising, Mrs. Clinton can conserve donations taken in by her official campaign committee. As of June 30, the campaign committee had spent $11.7 million and had $6.9 million in the bank. Mr. Lazio's campaign committee had spent $2.8 million and had $6.2 million on hand.</p>
        <p>Soft money is collected by party committees in unlimited amounts from any donor, and technically can be spent only on so-called party-building expenditures, like voter drives, not on candidates' campaigns.</p>
        <p>But in recent years, soft money spending has become virtually indistinguishable from spending by campaigns. The parties have carved a wide loophole in the regulations, using soft money to buy advertisements that promote or criticize candidates without explicitly mentioning their campaigns. (Such advertisements often end with announcers urging viewers to call the candidates.) Critics of the rules cite this change as evidence that sizable donations are corrupting the system.</p>
        <p>Official campaign committees, like Mrs. Clinton's, can spend money on advertisements that explicitly seek votes. These committees can collect a maximum of $2,000 per donor -- so-called hard money -- and corporations and unions are barred from giving.</p>
        <p>Not so with soft money committees. In June, for example, the Perry Corporation, an investment fund, donated $27,000 to a soft money committee spearheaded by Mrs. Clinton, while the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees gave $25,000. Several individuals also donated more than $25,000.</p>
        <p>The fund-raising arms of the two parties in Congress traditionally spend millions in tight races, but they typically wait until the weeks before the election. Jim Jordan, political director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in Washington, said the committee's early spending did not indicate that it was worried about Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''You can certainly interpret this as a sign of faith in and devotion to our candidate in New York, the importance of the race to the Senate and nationally, and our determination to win it,'' Mr. Jordan said. ''This committee spends its money, we hope, as rationally as possible, and we support winners, not losers.''</p>
        <p>The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is led by Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, who decides in consultation with other senators and aides how to distribute its money. An important factor is which candidates helped to gather it, and Mrs. Clinton has played a prominent role in the committee's fund-raising. The president does not wield any formal control over the committee, though he remains an influential figure in Democratic politics.</p>
        <p>The Lazio campaign contended that the spending showed that Democrats in Washington believed that they must prop up Mrs. Clinton. It said Mrs. Clinton was hypocritical for seeking a ban on soft money even as she collected such donations.</p>
        <p>''Mrs. Clinton is obviously having trouble raising real hard money from real New Yorkers,'' said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio's campaign. ''Fortunately for her, the left-wing Hollywood fat cats and big-money special-interests groups are apparently tripping over each other to help buy the Senate seat for her.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has not established a committee to raise soft money but has not ruled out doing so. And whether or not it is aided by Mr. Lazio, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is expected to spend millions in both soft and hard money in New York in the weeks before the election.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton have pledged to abide by a ban on soft money if the opposition does so first. Yet the two camps continue to bicker over the terms of such a ban.</p>
        <p>While the national Republican leadership has not yet assisted Mr. Lazio, other groups have. The Republican Leadership Council, an independent centrist group based in Washington, has spent $500,000 on advertisements promoting Mr. Lazio, including one that tries to link him to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat who is retiring. The council plans to spend another $500,000 by Labor Day.</p>
        <p>The state's Conservative Party has spent $60,000 on soft money advertisements for Mr. Lazio. Mr. Lazio also controls a political action committee, governed by relatively lax New York laws, that has spent $110,000 this year. On the other side, the New York affiliate of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League is paying $50,000 for commercials attacking Mr. Lazio's position on abortion.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's aides, apparently mindful that she stirs strong emotions among conservatives around the country, say they believe that Mr. Lazio's campaign will reap millions in contributions from donors outside New York, and expect that outside conservative groups will spend heavily in the state before the election.</p>
        <p>The Conservative Leadership Political Action Committee recently announced that it had formed the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton, saying in a fund-raising letter that it was trying to collect $9 million in the next 60 days to pay for advertisements and mailings. The emergency committee lists as its members such prominent conservatives as Edwin Meese 3rd, who was President Ronald Reagan's attorney general.</p>
        <p>Another group, the American Conservative Union, has published a 90-page book, ''Hillary Rodham Clinton: What Every American Should Know,'' and vowed to send it to every registered voter in New York. The book says it ''sheds light on the real Hillary Clinton -- her arrogance, her lust for power and money, her ties to the radical left in years past, and the far-left vision that she would impose on America today that fuels her drive for high office.''</p>
        <p>Asked about such efforts, Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said, ''Conservative groups from across the country have pledged to spend millions to defeat Hillary Clinton because they know that she'll be a strong supporter of a woman's right to choose and gun licensing and registration.''</p>
