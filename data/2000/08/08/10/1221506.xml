      <abstract>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The huge pension fund of the province of Quebec and Quebecor Inc., a newspaper and electronic media publisher based in Montreal, have made a new all-cash offer of 4.9 billion Canadian dollars, or $3.3 billion, for Groupe Videotron, Quebec's largest cable company. At 45 Canadian dollars a share, it is 4 Canadian dollars less than the two companies proposed to pay in March -- but that offer was half cash and half stock. The new offer is higher than a rival bid from Rogers Communications Inc. of Toronto, which valued at 4.9 billion Canadian dollars when it was made in February but is now worth 4.2 billion.</p>
