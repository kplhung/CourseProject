        <p>HERE'S the dish about the dish. The dish on our roof. The dish that got us out from under the cable monopoly:</p>
        <p>It wasn't easy putting it there. And it was more expensive than we thought.</p>
        <p>A few of us still remember when television was free. It used to be delivered by an antenna on top of the set, but a good picture of that sort hasn't been seen in Manhattan since S. Klein's on the Square.</p>
        <p>So we had to have cable. The first unfree television bill was a few dollars a month. But cable's channel packages kept changing, and to keep AMC, Bravo, TNT and other channels our household likes, we had to pay more. And more and more.</p>
        <p>Finally, with the Time Warner Cable bill exceeding $40 a month, without premium channels -- no ''Sopranos,'' no ''Sex and the City,'' no pay-per-view movies -- I joined the cable monopoly revolt. I made a call and said, ''Give me the dish!''</p>
        <p>I'd seen offers for free satellite television systems. But the one that caught my eye came in the e-mail in June from a DirecTV dealer. It was $29 for the system (I'd seen other systems for $99 or more), plus one year of service at a monthly rate of $21.99 for about 40 channels.</p>
        <p>Under ''terms'' the e-mail message added a caveat: The system had to be activated within 30 days, or we would be charged $299 for the equipment. A month seemed plenty of time. But installing it was something less than direct.</p>
        <p>I'm a city guy. I was an Eagle Scout. I compose music in my free time, and I built my own Web site. This would be a piece of cake. The only problem seemed to be whether our landlord would allow a satellite dish on the roof. He gave me the go-ahead -- he was ready to join the revolt, too.</p>
        <p>At the toll-free number for Standard Satellite, the seller in the e-mail message, I quickly closed the deal with a telephone salesclerk.</p>
        <p>For $35 more, she would even send along a package with ''everything needed'' to install the dish myself: 100 feet of RG-6 cable, a compass, an instructional videotape and other items that sounded promising.</p>
        <p>Still waiting for delivery from Standard Satellite a week after the order -- and with the meter running -- I phoned again. A different salesclerk answered and assured me that the company was not out to get customers for the $299; the penalty was just to prevent people from ordering the system and using it with another company. I'd measured the distance from my television set to where the landlord suggested I put the dish. I'd need 175 feet of cable. But Standard Satellite could provide only what came in the kit, she said. And it was not, in fact, a nice continuous 100 feet of cable, but two pieces of cable: 75 feet and 25 feet. She told me I could buy more cable at a store like Radio Shack.</p>
        <p>On the ninth day after I placed the order, two packages arrived: a big one with the dish and the receiver, and a small one with the installation kit. It was somewhat of a shock to find that the instructional videotape showed a young couple installing the dish in a rural or suburban one-story, single-family dwelling. My fantasy had been that the tape would show how to install it in a city apartment building. Just as disconcerting was the introductory part of the video, which listed the supposed contents of the $35 kit.</p>
        <p>There were the promised pieces of cable, 4 plastic wire ties, a compass, 4 lag screws, a ground block, 15 feet of ground wire, 25 feet of phone wire, a 6-foot video cable and a dual connector for the phone so that DirecTV could monitor the receiver for billing purposes. But where were the washers, the lead-shield expansion anchors, the ground clamp, nail clips, the tube of silicon sealant, the in-line coupler, the 6-foot stereo audiovideo cable, the protractor and the 2 feed-through bushings -- all of which the video also inventoried? And by the way, what were feed-through bushings? (They're plastic caps used to shield cable when it passes through the outside wall of a suburban ranch house.)</p>
        <p>I called the dealer and got the first phone clerk again. After at first insisting that the kit contained everything I would require to install the dish, she finally conceded that it contained everything the company had determined was needed. And if there was anything else I needed, I could just go get it myself.</p>
        <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
        <p>It was the kind of stonewall you'd expect if you unwittingly bought gray-market goods and tried to return them.</p>
        <p>I spent $25 on a 100-foot length of cable and a cable coupler at Radio Shack and $20 or so at the hardware store for a masonry drill bit, wire ties, washers and expansion anchors, which would hold the screws in the brick wall where I was putting up the dish. I had to buy two 50-foot extension cords for our old electric drill, to reach from our fourth-floor apartment to the roof above our six-story building. For $5 each at Odd Lots, that beat buying a cordless drill for $65 and up.</p>
        <p>Then came the fun part. The video proved to be just about useless. Fortunately, the main dish package came with printed instructions, and the DirecTV Web site had good suggestions. Drilling the holes into the roof wall was good for the biceps. Getting the dish up, and running the cable down to our apartment, would not challenge anyone who has passed Erector Set merit badge. The instructions weren't too clear about attaching the ground wire. But four phone calls later, even that problem was solved, and I grounded the system to a radiator. (Think of Ben Franklin flying his kite with a key attached to the string.)</p>
        <p>NEXT came something harder: aiming the dish. I'd done Franklin; now I needed Admiral Byrd.</p>
        <p>Relative to the Earth, DirecTV's satellite is a stationary object in space. It orbits at the same speed as the Earth turns, so it seems to be in one place in the sky all the time. I had to aim the dish at exactly this spot, using the compass that comes with the kit, which is about the size of the Sacajawea dollar -- but far less valuable.</p>
        <p>A trusty assistant is essential for this phase of the installation, and if your apartment is a few floors from where you are putting the dish, I recommend placing her near a window and equipping her with a whistle loud enough to be heard on the roof, where you will be stationed dishside with a socket wrench and that precision compass. She will also have to run back and forth from the window to the television, which is no harder to connect to the satellite receiver than it was to the cable box. Using a remote control unit, she can bring up a menu on screen that shows the strength of the satellite signal.</p>
        <p>Now, when it comes to aiming the dish, the DirecTV Web site's help pages say, ''We highly recommend that you have it professionally installed.'' But there was no turning back now.</p>
        <p>This was my first time dealing with terms like ''elevation'' and ''azimuth'' coordinates. You enter your ZIP code on DirecTV's dish-pointer Web page, or you can do it through the satellite receiver on the TV. In my case, the azimuth was 231.8, meaning that if I put the compass needle on N, I should point the dish at 231.8 degrees, or over toward the southwest. My elevation coordinate turned up as 35.5 degrees, or about a third of the way up from the horizon to the zenith.</p>
        <p>As the Wright brothers found at Kitty Hawk, it was trial and error, with me clambering up and down the super's ladder from the top of the elevator shaft to the roof, where I could yell down to the apartment and hear how we were doing.</p>
        <p>I started at 32 degrees, by using a scale etched in the arm holding the dish, and swept the dish around, horizontally, in an arc of 30 degrees or so, hoping to hear a whistle from three stories below. When that pass didn't succeed, I raised the elevation half a degree and repeated the routine. After numerous tries, I heard the eureka whistle. Like Houston suddenly making contact with astronauts coming round the dark side of the moon, the picture came in. For a few days, we made adjustments until our signal strength was above 90. (Anything over 70 is considered O.K.)</p>
        <p>So you may be wondering, then, was it worth it?</p>
        <p>Well, the satellite picture is better than cable's. For $10 more, or a monthly total of $31.99 to DirecTV, we get Total Choice -- 100-plus channels, which include almost all the cable-only stations that Time Warner offers with its Standard-plus-MetroChoice package and more besides: I'm delighted with the international news channels and programs like ''Ground Break'' on BBC America. In one episode, a hardy band of landscapers and a droll narrator help a woman create a surprise for her husband, who is away on a trip. In a half-hour of airtime, they add a decorative pool, a boardwalk, a row of cedars and other fine touches to a formerly barren backyard. And Trio, a Canadian channel with a horde of dramatic series, showed a beautiful print of Fellini's ''Casanova'' the other night, without commercial interruption.</p>
        <p>DirecTV's competitor, the Dish Network, has a similar deal called America's Top 100, for $29.99 a month. Each company's package contains about 15 channels that the competitor does not carry. And both packages include over 30 channels not in Time Warner's comparably priced Basic-plus-Standard-plus-MetroChoice package.</p>
        <p>But for local channels, Time Warner has the satellite services beat. Satellite TV does not offer New York 1 (Time Warner's own channel), nor the local PBS station, Channel 13, nor even WWOR, Channel 9. In fact, you don't get local channels from DirecTV at all unless you pay $5.99 more, and then they are only national versions of CBS, NBC, Fox, ABC and PBS, along with WPIX.</p>
        <p>We can't do without CUNY-TV, the Crosswalks stations and the Manhattan Neighborhood Cable stations, so we've decided to keep Time Warner Basic service for the local stations, at about $15 a month. With our satellite connection that gives us all but half a dozen of the channels we used to have with Time Warner.</p>
        <p>Still, we cut about $25 off our Time Warner Cable bill. The bottom line is, we have better quality and more variety, but our monthly television bill is about $5 less free than it used to be.</p>
