        <p>Greg Buxton is searching for sunken treasure of an elusive nature -- not gold or artifacts, but memories of 778 lives lost and largely forgotten in the depths of the Black Sea.</p>
        <p>Beginning on Thursday, he and a crew of volunteers will scour the seabed north of here with sonar for the Struma, a steamer sunk by a Russian submarine in 1942. The victims were mainly Romanian and Russian Jews fleeing the Holocaust. Among them were Mr. Buxton's paternal grandparents.</p>
        <p>The search and an attempt to organize a memorial ceremony next month have resurrected a wartime tragedy. They are provoking discomfort in Turkey -- the authorities recently indicated that they might not allow divers to approach the ship if it is found -- and renewing old questions about the response of other countries to the Nazi genocide.</p>
        <p>The Struma death toll was small compared with the totals in the millions in Europe. But Radu Ioanid, a scholar at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, said the sinking symbolized the indifference of many countries to the plight of the Jews during the war.</p>
        <p>The Struma's journey was desperate from the start. Fleeing massacres and labor camps, nearly 800 people paid $1,000 each for passage on the ship from Romania's Black Sea coast to Palestine. The passengers were jammed onto the 150-foot vessel, with makeshift bunks stacked 10 high and only one freshwater outlet.</p>
        <p>Before the ship left Constanza, Romania, on Dec. 11, 1941, the Romanian police took almost everything of worth, down to the copper pots in the galley. The engine failed a few miles out of port, and the captain of a passing tug repaired it in exchange for the wedding rings of the passengers, their only remaining valuables.</p>
        <p>The Struma limped along for three days, but its engine failed again, and Turkish tugs towed it into Istanbul. Fearing that passengers might try to remain in the country, the police kept them on board while the Turkish and British authorities decided their fate. Istanbul's Jews donated food, but conditions grew squalid as talks dragged on.</p>
        <p>Britain, which controlled Palestine, was generally unwilling to let in large numbers of refugees, and this case proved no exception. British officials refused to allow the passengers to continue without visas. Three people with expired visas were permitted to proceed overland, and a family of four left the ship through the intervention of Vehbi Koc, an influential Turkish Muslim businessman, who intervened at the request of an associate.</p>
        <p>Despite an emotional debate in Parliament in London, the British would not budge. Turkey was struggling to remain neutral in the war and feed its population and did not want to provide sanctuary for more people.</p>
        <p>Seventy days after its arrival, on the evening Feb. 23, 1942, the Turkish police took over the Struma and towed it up the Bosporus to the Black Sea. It was set adrift without a working engine. At dawn the next day, a Russian submarine sank it with a single torpedo. There has never been an explanation of why a Russian submarine would have attacked the Struma, a nonmilitary steamer out of a neutral port.</p>
        <p>David Stoliar was 19, fleeing Romania with his girlfriend and her family aboard the ship. Now 77 and living in Bend, Ore., he remembers every detail of that morning.</p>
        <p>''I was one of the lucky ones who was blown up into the air, and I fell into the sea,'' Mr. Stoliar said in a telephone interview today. ''When I came to the surface, there was nothing except a tremendous amount of debris and many, many people swimming in the water. It was very, very cold, and slowly we had a hard time moving our feet and our hands.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stoliar recalled fighting to stay afloat as the number of swimmers dwindled. As night fell, he was clinging to a piece of deck with a Bulgarian crewman. He saw no one else.</p>
        <p>The next morning Turks from a lighthouse plucked the two men from the water. The crewman was dead, and, it turned out, so was everyone else -- 103 children, 269 women and 406 men.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buxton, a computer programmer in Birmingham, England, heard the tale of the Struma from his father, Michael, now 83 -- who, a young Romanian at the time of the sinking, had enlisted in the British Army. Two years ago Greg Buxton decided to locate the ship, film it and conduct a memorial service to honor the grandparents he had never met. He sold his house to finance the effort and received some money from the Washington Holocaust museum.</p>
        <p>The first step is finding the wreckage, which is believed to be in about 250 feet of water 7 to 10 miles offshore. A museum and foundation affiliated with the Koc family, one of Turkey's wealthiest, is providing a research ship, and the museum director, Selcuk Kolay, will supervise the search.</p>
        <p>But the actual diving may not take place. Mr. Buxton said he had earlier received permission from the Turkish authorities for experienced divers to survey and film the Struma after it was located. But recently the authorities have reversed themselves.</p>
        <p>Turkish officials declined to discuss the matter. It is unclear whether the objection is a result of a bureaucratic snag, or whether, as a Western diplomat theorized, the government is uncomfortable about publicizing the wartime incident.</p>
        <p>As the tour boats and tankers plowed the Bosporus outside his hotel, Mr. Buxton tried to be philosophical. Whether or not the ship is found and the dive goes forward, he said, the memorial service on Sept. 3 will serve as a proper farewell to the 778 victims.</p>
        <p>Relatives of some passengers are expected to attend, and Mr. Stoliar, the lone survivor, said he would also like to come to offer his own goodbyes.</p>
