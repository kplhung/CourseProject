        <p>ABC News executives said yesterday that they would reprimand John Stossel, the news correspondent, for a report challenging the assumed benefits of organic food that was based in part on evidence that did not exist. The producer of the segment, David W. Fitzpatrick, is to be suspended without pay for one month, they said.</p>
        <p>Executives took the action two days after conceding that the report on organic food, which ran twice on ''20/20'' -- first on Feb. 4 and then again on July 7 -- had misrepresented tests done on behalf of ABC News.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the executives said, ''We've completed our review of the circumstances surrounding the error and have taken the appropriate actions.''</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Stossel nor Mr. Fitzpatrick would comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stossel said in the report that testing commissioned by ABC News showed that conventional produce did not necessarily have more pesticide residue than did organic produce, debunking a main selling point for organic food.</p>
        <p>But the two researchers who were commissioned by ABC -- Dr. Michael Doyle, a scientist with the University of Georgia, and Dr. Lester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy at Georgetown University -- said they had never tested produce for pesticide residue for ABC.</p>
        <p>In a letter dated Feb. 8, the Environmental Working Group, which supports the consumption of organic food, alerted Mr. Stossel that the researchers said they had not conducted the tests.</p>
        <p>In a return letter, Mr. Fitzpatrick insisted that such tests did, indeed, exist. When the report was rebroadcast in July, Mr. Stossel re-emphasized the supposed pesticide tests results in an on-the-air discussion with Cynthia McFadden, a ''20/20'' anchor. Executives said yesterday that, upon investigation, they believe Mr. Fitzpatrick truly thought the pesticide tests had been performed on produce, even after he was contacted by the Environmental Working Group. Apparently, the executives said, he did not follow up carefully enough after the concerns were raised. The Environmental Working Group criticized ABC for not meting out stiffer discipline.</p>
        <p>''I think it's outrageous that they are letting Stossel off the hook and slapping a producer on the wrist after they lied and threatened an entire industry by disseminating false and damaging information,'' said Ken Cook, the group's president.</p>
        <p>The group has also asserted that Mr. Stossel's report inappropriately implied ABC testing had detected dangerous strains of E. coli bacteria in organic food when the tests did not establish the presence of the dangerous type of E. coli. Executives said Mr. Stossel may address that concern during an on-air apology he is scheduled to make tomorrow.</p>
