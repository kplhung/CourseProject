        <p>Desperate for points after two disappointing matches last month, Bruce Arena, the coach of the United States men's national team, yesterday shuffled his 18-man roster for next week's critical World Cup qualifying match against Barbados.</p>
        <p>Arena named six new players to the team, including two strikers who are coming back from injuries: Joe-Max Moore (Everton) and Brian McBride (Columbus Crew). Moore is coming back from a knee injury and McBride from a broken cheekbone.</p>
        <p>The other new additions are goalkeeper Tony Meola (Kansas City Wizards), Jeff Agoos (D.C. United), Carlos Llamosa (D.C. United) and John O'Brien (Ajax).</p>
        <p>The MetroStars midfielder Tab Ramos remains with the team, but Arena dropped Ramos's teammate, Clint Mathis, who did not play in either of the United States' first two matches, a 1-1 draw in Guatemala and a 2-1 loss in Costa Rica. After two away matches, the Americans play the next three qualifiers at home, beginning with Wednesday's match against Barbados in Foxboro, Mass.</p>
