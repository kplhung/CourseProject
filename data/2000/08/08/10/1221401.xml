        <p>Computer users seeking a laser printer at those low, low inkjet prices will find just the thing on the market later this month. Samsung Electronics is rolling out the ML-4500, a small, versatile laser printer for the unusually low street price of $199.</p>
        <p>The Samsung ML-4500, which prints in black and white, works with systems running Windows 95 or later. It will also work with Linux and uses a parallel port to connect to the computer. The ML-4500 can print up to 8 pages per minute and has a resolution of 600 dots per inch. The printer also features something called ''N-up printing mode,'' which the company says can be used to print up to 16 minipages of text on one piece of paper, thus creating an index sheet to help find your way through long documents.</p>

        <p>Computer users seeking a laser printer at those low, low inkjet prices will find just the thing on the market later this month. Samsung Electronics is rolling out the ML-4500, a small, versatile laser printer for the unusually low street price of $199.</p>
        <p>The Samsung ML-4500, which prints in black and white, works with systems running Windows 95 or later. It will also work with Linux and uses a parallel port to connect to the computer. The ML-4500 can print up to 8 pages per minute and has a resolution of 600 dots per inch. The printer also features something called ''N-up printing mode,'' which the company says can be used to print up to 16 minipages of text on one piece of paper, thus creating an index sheet to help find your way through long documents.</p>
        <p>Unlike their slower, less-expensive inkjet brethren, which shoot small drops of ink onto the paper to create text and images, laser printers use a printing process similar to that of a photocopier. Even though laser-printer prices have fallen quite a bit, this printing method, which is generally faster and produces higher-quality prints, usually costs more than inkjet printers.</p>
        <p>The $199 price, which is about $100 cheaper than for many other printers in its category, may appeal to buyers for price alone. Samsung is also touting the ML-4500 for its ''paper-jam-free technology.'' For anyone who has had to extract bits of the company's annual report from a printer's innards while on deadline, the ML-4500 could pay for itself rather quickly.</p>
