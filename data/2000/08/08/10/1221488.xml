        <p>CURTIS MARTIN was in a playful mood yesterday. Professional football is serious stuff but after six years in the National Football League he has earned the right to take a lighthearted look at his profession.</p>
        <p>When someone asked Martin if he wanted an expended role this season he chuckled, ''I'd like it to grow; that depends on Groh.''</p>
        <p>Martin was referring to Al Groh, the Jets' first-year head coach. The touch of humor reflected the ease of the veteran running back and the mood of Jets Camp 2000.</p>
        <p>The organization -- from players to front office, has talked about moving out of the Bill Parcells era. It is unclear whether that era will end any time soon. Parcells's fingerprints are all over these Jets. He's still in the front office as the director of football operations.</p>
        <p>Everybody wants to turn the page but at the same time they want to recapture the magic of 1998, when the Jets came within a game of reaching the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>For that to happen, the Jets will need players like Martin and Aaron Glenn to apply the lessons they learned under Parcells. They'll have to be the brakes that keep the franchise from skidding into darkness.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Glenn and Martin talked about Parcells's influence.</p>
        <p>''He taught me mental toughness,'' said Glenn, who made his first Pro Bowl under Parcells. ''When I first got in this league, I was just a young guy just trying to play; he taught me another aspect of the game that great players play when they have nicks and bruises. He taught me how to mentally block a lot of things out.''</p>
        <p>Martin looks sharper than ever. He said his accelerated summer conditioning program was inspired by something Parcells told him last spring.</p>
        <p>''He said something to me that kind of changed my outlook on conditioning,'' Martin said. ''He said: 'Son, there's a difference between routine and commitment. Some guys just do the routine over and over again, but some guys are committed to getting better.'</p>
        <p>''I'm a guy that's committed to getting better. What he said just took my commitment to another level. Sometimes you need somebody to say something to you that sparks something new in you; that's something that he spoke that sparked a new flame, a higher flame in me.</p>
        <p>''The different things he taught me are things that have built a foundation for my career. He taught me about mental toughness, he taught me about the attitude to have on the field, he taught me about work ethics that I'll never forget. And those things have built my career. Coming into the league now, without Bill, if this was my rookie year, I don't believe I would have the success that I have had.''</p>
        <p>When asked about Groh, Martin said he never got to know the new head coach until last winter.</p>
        <p>''In getting to know the way he thinks, he's very similar,'' Martin said. ''Al is a principled guy. He is a very wise coach, he's much smarter that I thought. He's really encouraged me with the wisdom that he has as a coach.''</p>
        <p>Groh is part of a new foundation of a new structure. I wondered whether the Jets' progress from 1996, when they were 1-15, to now might be compromised by jettisoning a player like Keyshawn Johnson and losing a coach like Parcells.</p>
        <p>Johnson still can't understand the trade. He received his money from Tampa Bay but can't understand why a team so close to achieving its goal would get rid of its best player.</p>
        <p>In one interview Johnson said that Groh ''doesn't want to have the responsibility of losing with a Bill Parcells team.''</p>
        <p>''At least he builds his own team and he can tell people, 'We're rebuilding, we're rebuilding,' ''Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Maybe Groh couldn't deal with Johnson's individualism; maybe Johnson was such a dominant personality that others, including a first-year coach, would have difficulty finding their own voice.</p>
        <p>Richie Anderson, one of Johnson's best friends on the team, said that in a football sense, the offense is closer now that Parcells is upstairs, Johnson in Florida.</p>
        <p>''Things happen and teams come together and some fall apart,'' he said. ''It seems like we're closing in a little better.''</p>
        <p>Groh announced yesterday that the speedy Dedric Ward would replace Johnson as the other starting wide receiver along with Wayne Chrebet.</p>
        <p>Life moves on, the game moves on. The Jets seem to be getting on with their football lives.</p>
        <p>Keyshawn had better get on with his.</p>
