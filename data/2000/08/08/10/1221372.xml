        <p>SOMETIMES the past is worth repeating. The original Diablo, released late in 1996, had its roots in the classics.

        <p>Role-playing games are usually quick to assign onerous housekeeping tasks and slow to offer rewards. Diablo reversed that equation. The housekeeping was comparatively minor.

        <p>SOMETIMES the past is worth repeating. The original Diablo, released late in 1996, had its roots in the classics. Blizzard Entertainment's designers conceived it as a more lavish version of graphically spartan role-playing games like Hack and Rogue from the early days of computer gaming.</p>
        <p>Role-playing games are usually quick to assign onerous housekeeping tasks and slow to offer rewards. Diablo reversed that equation. The housekeeping was comparatively minor. The interface was so simple that the housekeeping was even fun. The rewards were everywhere. And while it sparked debate about whether it was a role-playing game or an action game, Diablo nevertheless captured a huge audience and stirred rival publishers.</p>
        <p>Diablo II paints Diablo's concept onto a much larger canvas -- if Diablo was the dungeon-oriented Hack, Diablo II is the more worldly Omega. It has that same classical balance and proportion.</p>
        <p>Sensibly, Blizzard has not made repairs where repairs were not needed. Once again, you are looking down on your character from an angle. Once again, the controls are simple: one mouse button for weapon swings, the other for casting spells. Once again, the game world is visually striking, and the action remains fast and furious.</p>
        <p>And once again, the game smoothly blends action and role-playing. You simply pick one of five characters and from there, it's straight to the starting camp. That's where you learn the rudiments of the story and are dispatched to prove your mettle.</p>
        <p>But everything here seems larger than in the original Diablo. When you cross the rain-dappled river that leads into the wilderness, the sheer size of the bridge and the camp's log walls suggest that you are embarking on a quest that is larger than life. And that game world extends far beyond the original game's single deep dungeon.</p>
        <p>Actual size is important, but so is the impression of size. Diablo II stretches out toward a horizon that seems to advance before you like the curve of the earth. And it is a perilous landscape: monsters that spot you will move toward you as if drawn by a magnet.</p>
        <p>To be sure, you can save your progress only at your base, which will never seem quite close enough, and death waits patiently for the adventurer who pauses too long.</p>
        <p>But it's an inconvenience rather than a tragedy: you reappear in camp beside your corpse with your status and most of your booty intact. Teleportation pads can take you back to the scene of a fatal mistake. You carry some of the burdens typically associated with role-playing games, but they are manageable burdens. That's part of the art and the beauty of being Diablo II.</p>
        <p>Diablo is so influential that it has come to define a subgenre: RPG Lite. Interplay's recent game, Soulbringer, developed by Gremlin Interactive, fits squarely in that category. It is accessible, it is darkly pretty and it is fun. As your character approaches an inhospitable river town on a snowy night, the game acquires a rich cloak of atmosphere, a quality that the often frenetic Diablo II often seems to lack.</p>
        <p>Once you perform some basic quests, like clearing out the brigands who occupy the marketplace, the town will open its doors and gates to admit you to the surrounding countryside. In the process, Soulbringer offers some compelling adventures and plays some very nasty tricks. Soulbringer has some of the meticulousness of a full-blown role-playing game, but it also has the immediacy of a Diablo, and it's a nice mix.</p>
        <p>Icewind Dale, also from Interplay, is the flip side of this coin. It's a big, brawny role-playing game in the spirit and shape of Baldur's Gate, which used a version of the same game engine. You create up to six characters in detail, right down to their biographies and traditional antipathies, and shepherd them through the frozen wastes of the Forgotten Realms using Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rules.</p>
        <p>But if Diablo II feels like moving back in with your parents, Icewind is like breaking in new roommates. You've got to get to know those roommates before you can like them, and that requires an investment of time and energy.</p>
        <p>You make sure that everyone is  fitted out in the best kit possible for your budget. And then one day a goblin gets in a lucky hit, a character dies and you feel a twinge of regret that goes beyond the simple inconvenience of finding a temple to resurrect him. You can't help missing your characters when they are killed. You have grown used to them, and after all, they are what you have made them.</p>
        <p>Diablo II, published by Blizzard Entertainment; $59.95; for Windows 95, 98, 2000, NT with Service Pack 5 and MacOS 8.1 or later; for mature audiences. Soulbringer, published by Interplay; $44.81; for Windows 95/98; for teenagers. Icewind Dale, published by Interplay; $44; for Windows 95/98; for teenagers.</p>
