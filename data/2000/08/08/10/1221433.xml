      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The dot-com mania has not died.</p>
        <p>Phone.com and Software.com, two relatively small, money-losing software companies, announced they were merging yesterday, and investors responded by adding $2.6 billion to their combined market values.</p>
        <p>The ''.com'' suffix in both companies' names, moreover, is somewhat misleading, as neither does business through its Web site.</p>
        <p>Software.com sells software that Internet service providers, like AT&amp;T Worldnet, use to operate their electronic mail systems. Phone.com has developed a tiny browser program that allows wireless telephones to view specially formatted Internet sites. The browser is free, but Phone.com makes money selling software used by purveyors of sites meant for the wireless phones.</p>
        <p>The California-based companies have no overlapping products, and the main thing that they have in common is that they both sell their products primarily to telephone companies.</p>
        <p>In the future, however, the companies were primed to become more direct competitors. They were both developing products allowing telephone companies to offer unified messaging services, in which voice messages, faxes, electronic mail and so on are all collected into a single place and then distributed to the device of the user's choice, be it a computer, a telephone or a wireless gadget.</p>
        <p>This opportunity appeared to be compelling enough to Donald J. Listwin, a Software.com board member who was, until Tuesday, also an executive vice president of Cisco Systems, that he proposed that he run the combined company last week amid the final negotiations between Phone.com and Software.com.</p>
        <p>''I approached folks and said you may need help pulling off a complex merger and how do you feel about my joining the team,'' Mr. Listwin said yesterday. He knew the new company's customers because at Cisco he managed the sale of Internet network hardware to telephone companies and service providers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Listwin will become president and chief executive. Alain Rossman, the chief executive of Phone.com, will become chairman and executive vice president. John L. MacFarlane, the chief executive of Software.com, will be an executive vice president.</p>
        <p>(Mr. MacFarlane's consolation prize for giving up the chief executive spot is that his shares are now worth $710 million. Mr. Rossman's shares are worth $336 million.)</p>
        <p>The new company has not been named, but will either be Software.com or Phone.com. The combined company will have headquarters in Redwood City, the Silicon Valley home of Phone.com; Software.com has been based in Santa Barbara. None of the combined company's 1,500 employees will be laid off.</p>
        <p>Both companies have ridden a roller coaster in the stock market, but unlike most purveyors of Web sites and online stores, they still enjoyed the sort of stock market values unheard of in the pre-Internet era.</p>
        <p>Phone.com's shares have ranged between $27.50 and $208 in the last year, and were $78 on Tuesday, before the deal was announced, giving it a value of $6.1 billion. Software.com's shares ranged between $22 and $155, closing Monday at $107.75 giving it a value of $5.1 billion.</p>
        <p>At best, investors were betting on the companies rapid growth, rather than their current financial performance. In the most recent quarter, Phone.com lost $166 million on sales of $28.7 million. Software.com lost $11 million on sales of $29.5 million. Mr. Listwin said he hoped the company could achieve $1 billion in annual sales in two years.</p>
