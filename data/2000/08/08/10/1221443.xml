        <p>THIS is about memory: Oscar Brand's, and America's. Mr. Brand remembers how, before soft money and sound bites, before attack ads and tightly scripted conventions, presidential candidates were something to sing about. He remembers songs like ''Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too,'' and before one can interrupt -- Mr. Brand, you're only 80, and that's not old enough for you to know this stuff firsthand -- he is doing ''Get on the Raft With Taft.''</p>
        <p>''Keep Cool with Coolidge?'' It was hot when Mr. Brand was young: he was 9 when Coolidge left the White House. But ''Roosevelt the Cry'' did not pass his lips as a child -- that was 1 minute 14 seconds for Teddy, not Franklin D.</p>

        <p>THIS is about memory: Oscar Brand's, and America's. Mr. Brand remembers how, before soft money and sound bites, before attack ads and tightly scripted conventions, presidential candidates were something to sing about. He remembers songs like ''Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too,'' and before one can interrupt -- Mr. Brand, you're only 80, and that's not old enough for you to know this stuff firsthand -- he is doing ''Get on the Raft With Taft.''</p>
        <p>''Keep Cool with Coolidge?'' It was hot when Mr. Brand was young: he was 9 when Coolidge left the White House. But ''Roosevelt the Cry'' did not pass his lips as a child -- that was 1 minute 14 seconds for Teddy, not Franklin D.</p>
        <p>''These songs were part of the texture of American life,'' he says. ''I'd learn them without even realizing it.''</p>
        <p>But wait. The man who is singing these red-blooded songs about candidates of yesteryear is a Canadian-American -- born in Winnipeg, he wrote a tune he says could have become the Canadian national anthem. ''Something to Sing About,'' it is called. ''Any Canadian knows the chorus,'' he declares flatly, ''but they said, 'We want a French song,' so that's why 'O Canada.' ''</p>
        <p>So -- our refrain here -- why American campaign songs?</p>
        <p>The explanation is long and winding. In order, more or less: the leg that was two inches shorter than the other (the search for a surgeon brought his family to New York when he was a teenager), the years in the United States Army in World War II (he spent the war in New York, as section chief of a psychology unit and, later, as editor of a newspaper for psychiatric patients), the questioning by an investigator from the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950's (''I was anti-Communist, or at least anti-Stalinist, but I said I couldn't testify to something I didn't know firsthand''), the work as curator of the Songwriters' Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>Yes, but the campaign songs?</p>
        <p>He holds this truth to be self-evident: Politics is politics, but in the old days, everyone did it while singing. And that led, in a way that seemed seamless, to how Mr. Brand worked campaign songs into a 1968 show called ''How to Steal an Election.'' This being an election year, one should not be surprised that a revival is opening in Los Angeles on Saturday; Annette Bening and Rob Reiner will preside over a gala next week. And, for the second time since 1952, Mr. Brand has made a campaign-song recording: ''Presidential Campaign Songs, 1789-1996'' (Smithsonian Folkways Recordings).</p>
        <p>Nowadays there are those who consider campaign songs, like bumper stickers, irrelevant. Mr. Brand dissents.</p>
        <p>''You watch the Bush convention? What was the big song? 'God Bless America.' That's not a new song. I'm not crazy about it. Woody hated it. 'This Land Is Your Land,' it was originally called 'God Blessed America to Me.' '' Mr. Brand sings it the way he says his buddy Woody -- Mr. Guthrie, his name to you and me -- sang it on the radio: different, angrier lyrics, not the words you memorized as a child. ''He changed it afterward,'' Mr. Brand says.</p>
        <p>THE mention of radio signals another digression. For 55 years, Mr. Brand has had a folk song show on WNYC -- Mr. Guthrie was a frequent guest. Mr. Brand had written to the station when he was discharged from the Army and had been told to go on the air one Saturday night, then the next. Then he was told to go ''across the street.''</p>
        <p>''Across the street'' meant City Hall -- the city owned and operated the station until a few years ago. Mr. Brand's summons came after he had featured a G.I. singing from a German songbook he had brought home.</p>
        <p>So, across the street he went.</p>
        <p>''A little voice from behind the desk said, 'You're Brand?' '' Mr. Brand says. This in a squeaky voice, with an explanation: ''I make fun of him with the voice, but I think he was the great mayor.'' He is imitatingFiorello H. La Guardia.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Mr. Mayor.' He said, 'We hear you're singing Nazi songs on the air.' I said, 'Your honor, these are not Nazi songs, these are old German songs, from the Hundred Years War. There are no Nazi songs among them. It's an old lieder book.''</p>
        <p>''He said, 'What do I tell these people who are calling and saying, ''What are we paying this man to do that?'' ' I said, 'Sir, I don't get paid.' He said, 'That'll do it,' and went right back to work as if I wasn't there.'' He told O'Dwyer, Impellitteri, Wagner, Lindsay, Beame and Koch the same thing. ''Every time there was a problem, I'd meet the mayor, and it would last until I said, 'I don't get paid.' ''</p>
        <p>A mention that he has been in broadcasting about as long as Joe Franklin leads down another byway: once, they were paired as presenters at the Emmy Awards. ''He was short, and I was tall. It was a funny sight. I was told, 'If he talks a lot, see if you can get him off.' I got the signal: get off. So I picked him up and carried him off.''</p>
        <p>Our refrain again: The campaign songs?</p>
        <p>''It's good to have a name that's rhymable. Adams is not easy to do.'' He sings John Adams's big song, to the tune of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''</p>
        <p>'' 'Get on a Raft with Taft,' that rhymes very well,'' he says. ''But it has no meaning when you have a man weighs 370 pounds in the raft. Still, you get a good song, you could almost get a man elected on that.''</p>
