        <p>Two small planes collided in the sky over a southern New Jersey subdivision yesterday morning, killing all 11 people on board and raining bodies onto a soccer field and through the roof of a garage. One plane crashed through the roof of another two-car garage and exploded, setting fire to the home of a couple who were showering and dressing for work.</p>
        <p>No one on the ground appeared to have been hurt as a result of the collision, which involved a charter plane carrying civilian employees of the  Navy and a plane carrying a licensed pilot and an instructor. The cause was not known late yesterday. Both planes were flying without the guidance of air traffic controllers. The pilots were expected to see and avoid other traffic.</p>
        <p>The collision occurred at 7:54 a.m., apparently southeast of a sprawling development in Burlington County called Steeplechase that sprang up in recent years in what had been farmland north of Philadelphia, about 10 miles south of Trenton.</p>
        <p>The plane carrying the pilot and instructor  crashed in a soybean field northeast of the development. The engine of the charter plane plummeted into a front yard while the fuselage crashed into the garage. Three bodies landed in the soccer field, where, one woman said, she saw two bodies still belted into seats. Another body plunged through the roof of a garage on Spur Court.</p>
        <p>Debris lay scattered like confetti along Steeplechase Boulevard. Jackie Framo, getting dressed, looked out her window to see a chunk of engine smoldering in a crater on her lawn.</p>
        <p>''Another few feet and it would have been in my ear,'' said Ed Trzaskawka, who told The Associated Press that he was preparing for work when most of the charter plane hit the garage of his house on Philly Court and blew up. According to the New Jersey State Police, Mr. Trzaskawka's wife, Cathy, was in the shower. They grabbed their dog and fled before the house burned.</p>
        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who said Mrs. Trzaskawka had worked in the governor's office until several years ago, said at a news conference in a nearby baseball field yesterday afternoon: ''If you can look for a bright side of this, the miracle is that no one on the ground was injured. Even in the house into which the plane crashed.''</p>
        <p>According to Arlene Salac, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, the larger of the two twin-engine planes was a PA31 Piper Navajo registered to Tigress Air of California, Md., doing business as Patuxent Airways. The smaller plane was a PA44 Piper Seminole operated by Hortman Aviation, a flight school at Northeast Philadelphia Airport.</p>
        <p>The charter plane, with two pilots and seven passengers, was on a daily shuttle flight between the Lakehurst Naval Air Station in New Jersey and the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland. The pilot had flown to Trenton-Mercer Airport under air traffic control guidance, then had chosen to fly under visual flight rules, Ms. Salac said.</p>
        <p>The other plane, carrying an instructor from the Hortman Aviation flight school and a licensed pilot who was seeking an advanced rating, had set off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport. The two men had planned to fly in a large circle over an area designated by the F.A.A. as a flight practice area, according to Herbert Hortman, the school's owner.</p>
        <p>The student, who was not identified, was a licensed pilot pursuing his commercial license. The instructor was Craig Robinson, 28, of Hamilton Township, N.J. He was also an officer with the Washington Township Police Department in Mercer County. According to Mr. Hortman, Mr. Robinson was an experienced pilot with 1,800 to 2,000 hours of flying time. Mr. Hortman said the 18-year-old plane had passed a full maintenance inspection one month ago.</p>
        <p>''It does not appear to be a mechanical problem,'' Mr. Hortman said. ''It appears to be strictly a midair. Unfortunately, it's like if you're out driving in your car and somebody drives through an intersection and hits you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson had been flying since he was 17 and had never expressed any fear, members of his family said. Ted Kszepa, his father-in-law, said Mr. Robinson's wife and 5-month-old son, who was christened on Sunday, often flew with him. ''For him, it was like walking down the street,'' Mr. Kszepa said. ''He loved to fly.''</p>
        <p>At the big naval base at Lakehurst,  employees were grim as they absorbed the news about the shuttle, which takes engineers and managers daily between the base and its command headquarters in Maryland. Pat Murphy, a spokesman at the base, said most of the employees on the base had traveled on that shuttle at one time or another.</p>
        <p>The names of the passengers were released last night: Michael Simodejka, 52, of Toms River, head of the logistics division at Lakehurst; Angelo George, 39, of Toms River, a program manager; Cynthia Kovacs of Robbinsville, a mechanical engineer; Robert Polo of Barnegat, a logistics management specialist; John Zukow, 66, of Toms River, an engineering technician; John Vail Jr. of Howell, a program manager; and David Dahlen, a contractor with Naval Inventory Control Point, of Warminster, Pa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simodejka worked at Lakehurst for at least 20 years, said his cousin, John Simodejka of Pottsville, Pa. He had been traveling regularly between New Jersey and Maryland, relatives said.</p>
        <p>Mr. George was a longtime Defense Department employee and the father of four young children, a neighbor said.</p>
        <p>The neighbor, David Karu, 35, said Mr. George's twin toddlers turned 1 last month. ''Everybody on the block definitely feels this,'' Mr. Karu said.  The other two victims were the pilots, Daniel Groff and Joseph Mari, who worked for Patuxent Airways, the Navy said.</p>
        <p>The Lakehurst base, which avoided being shut down in the mid-1990's when Congress was cutting back its military operations, has 2,000 civilian employees and 500 enlisted personnel, Mr. Murphy said. It is an engineering base that provides support for Navy aircraft, through research and development and by manufacturing parts for aircraft.</p>
        <p>Drew Steketee, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, which represents 360,000 pilots nationwide, said it was not unusual for pilots to fly without air traffic control help. He said only 30 percent of the 35 million flights a year occurred under instrument flight rules, guided by traffic controllers and radar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steketee, who was trained at Trenton-Mercer Airport, said pilots sometimes chose to switch to visual flight rules after air traffic controllers had advised them of delays, which are not uncommon in the busy Trenton area. Less often, he said, a pilot might choose visual flight rules if clearance has been given by air traffic controllers, but only to take a circuitous route to avoid congestion.</p>
        <p>National Transportation Safety Board investigators, who were on the scene late yesterday, are expected to review, among other things, communications between the pilot of the chartered plane and the controllers at Trenton-Mercer Airport.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steketee said a study by the association's Air Safety Foundation found that there were an average of 17 midair collisions a year between 1983 and 1999. On average, 10 crashes had at least one death. He said midair collisions were more likely to  occur at lower altitudes, as two planes are converging on a runway.</p>
