        <p>August Wilson's drama ''Jitney'' is moving to the Union Square Theater, where performances are to start Sept. 19. The production, which opened at Second Stage Theater on April 25 and will continue there through Sept. 10, had to make room for the Second Stage's new season.</p>
        <p>''Jitney,'' which has been playing to near-capacity houses in the Second Stage's 299-seat theater on West 43rd Street, also wanted a larger house; the Union Square Theater on East 17th Street has 499 seats.</p>
