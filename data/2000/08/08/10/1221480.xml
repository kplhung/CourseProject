        <p>One instant it was a normal weekday morning in the suburbs and the next it was a surreal nightmare.</p>
        <p>Three bodies fell from one of the planes that had collided in midair, and landed in an athletic field where the children of the Steeplechase subdivision play soccer and football and families gather annually for an end-of-the-summer block party.</p>
        <p>Another body crashed through the roof of a garage on Spur Court a few hundred feet east of the field. An engine plummeted into Jackie Framo's yard, about 40 feet from her front doorstep, while she was dressing. At first, when she looked out of her window, she thought an underground gas main had exploded because she saw smoke pouring up from ''this mangled piece of metal.''</p>
        <p>Robert Bucci, a 34-year-old furniture wholesaler, heard a loud noise, apparently the collision, as he sat at his home computer, punching furniture sales orders to a factory in Iowa. He hurried outside and said he saw a plane spinning in circles and burning as it passed over a corner of his house about 30 feet above the roof.</p>
        <p>''It scared the heck out of me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bucci started running up Steeplechase Boulevard, the main street through the development, but was stopped, he said, by a big explosion, a huge ball of fire and flames jumping from the curbside openings of storm sewers.</p>
        <p>The plane had slammed into the side of a garage at 1 Philly Court and burst into flames, incinerating two cars in the garage and dooming the remaining five of the plane's original nine passengers -- all civilian naval employees -- who had remained in the plane after their four colleagues plummeted onto the grounds of the development.</p>
        <p>The fire destroyed the brick Georgian home at 1 Philly Court, with two flower urns flanking the front door. It also scorched a wall of an adjacent house. All the occupants and their pets fled safely and no one was hurt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bucci said that when the plane exploded, he was rushing toward the house in hopes of helping someone. But the flames blocked him.</p>
        <p>The twin-engine plane skimmed the rooftops in Steeplechase. The other plane, a two-seater, with a pilot instructor and an aviation student aboard, limped along the development's northern edge and fell into a field of soybeans, killing both aboard.</p>
        <p>Mary Miles, 30, wanted to help some of the victims but realized minutes after seeing them that her intentions were futile.</p>
        <p>She was taking a shower when she heard a rumbling that she mistook for thunder. Minutes later, she went downstairs, heard a televised news report about the crash and then looked out her kitchen window onto the development's athletic field and saw what she thought was a body.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Miles said the body had not been there a half-hour earlier when she put her pet dogs into the backyard.</p>
        <p>''I ran out to help,'' she recalled. ''But I got about three-quarters of the way up to the body and realized there was nothing I could do.'' Realizing the person was dead, she returned to her kitchen and called 911.</p>
        <p>Sean Sausman, 12, said the first instinct of his mother, Kathy, was to rush to the burning house. Sean said they watched from their driveway as the plane spun toward 1 Philly Court.</p>
        <p>''I saw the plane going down, trailing smoke,'' the boy said. ''My mom's a nurse and she wanted to go down to see what she could do to help. But all of a sudden all these police cars and ambulances went flying by our house.''</p>
        <p>In the end, all the residents escaped unhurt. After visiting the crash site in late morning, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman termed the absence of injuries on the ground a miracle.</p>
        <p>Steeplechase has about 700 homes, all built in the last five years on a 37-acre plot once filled by soybeans. It is about 10 miles  northeast of Philadelphia and is one of hundreds of big subdivisions that have filled the woods and fields throughout New Jersey in the last 20 years. The development has a horse racing motif. One section is called Belmont, another Churchill Downs and another the Paddock.</p>
        <p>As dusk fell, scores of children and parents pushing babies in strollers went to the police lines near the complex's ball field to glimpse the ruins of 1 Philly Court about 300 yards away.</p>
        <p>The state police let three reporters view the crash site where the five bodies were found. They reported to the rest of the media that neighbors were sitting in their yards, sipping cool drinks, and declining to talk about the day's events.</p>
        <p>Their yards were cluttered with debris from the plane, all sitting in the middle of bright orange circles of spray paint that investigators had applied.</p>
