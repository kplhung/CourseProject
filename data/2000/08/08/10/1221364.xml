        <p>Q.  Is there a way to put my Internet Explorer 5.0 Favorites in the order I want them, instead of in the order I collected them?</p>
        <p>A. There are a couple of ways for you to rearrange the Web sites on your Favorites list to your liking.</p>
        <p>You can click on the names of the sites and drag them to where you want them to go.</p>
        <p>If you have a large number of sites bookmarked and would like a quicker method of arranging them, you can put them into alphabetical order. To do that, click once on the Favorites menu in your Explorer menu bar, then right-click on any of the sites on the list. Select Sort by Name to rearrange the list alphabetically by site name.</p>
        <p>If you use folders within your Favorites list, you will need to open each folder and right-click to sort by name.</p>
        <p>Macintosh users running Internet Explorer 5.0 should click on the Favorites tab on the left side of the browser window, then on the Organize button.</p>
        <p>Select Open Favorites Window and click on the Name button at the top of the column to sort them alphabetically.</p>
        <p>Q.  Are MP3 files illegal, or is it trading them that is against the law?</p>
        <p>A.  An MP3 audio file itself is not illegal. MP3 is a computer file format that allows the conversion of music from a compact disc or other audio source into a small, good-quality computer file.</p>
        <p>It is what is done with MP3 files after they are made that has become controversial, as illustrated by the current legal fight between Napster and the Recording Industry Association of America.</p>
        <p>Napster is one of the Web services  that allow people to search for MP3 files online and download them -- or  upload their own MP3 files.</p>
        <p>The use of MP3 files falls under  United States copyright law, and the recording industry group says that Napster contributes to copyright infringement. (For anyone interested in the Copyright Law of the United States itself, a complete version can be downloaded in text or Portable Document Format at lcweb.loc.gov /copyright/title17.)</p>
        <p>Converting songs from a CD to the MP3 format so that you can play them on your computer or a portable MP3 player is legal as long as you paid for the original CD.</p>
        <p>In that regard, it is just like making a tape from albums in your music collection for your personal use. As long as you do not publicly redistribute the music without authorization from the copyright holder, making a copy for private use is currently fine.</p>
        <p>Many songs that surface on the Internet were probably copied from their original sources and distributed illegally, but there are many sites where you can legally download and listen to MP3 files.</p>
        <p>The recording artists -- most of them not signed with a record label -- who created the songs on those sites, like the ones found on MP3.com (www.mp3.com), have given the site permission to distribute their songs.</p>
        <p>Q.  I keep getting a ''disk is locked'' message when trying to copy a file to a floppy. Is it my old Mac or the disk that's bad?</p>
        <p>A.  The problem is most probably with the floppy disk, but it's not as bad as it might seem. On the back of the disk, you should see a small plastic tab in a corner. If that tab is in the ''up'' position, exposing a small hole in the disk, then the disk has been locked to prevent anyone from overwriting the files on it.</p>
        <p>To unlock it, slide the tab to the lower position and reinsert the floppy into your drive. Windows users who are getting ''cannot write'' messages while trying to save a file to a floppy should check the tab on the disk as well.</p>
        <p>The lock is similar to the cassette-tape tabs that you can punch out to keep the tape from being copied over. The machine senses whether the tab is there and stops you from overwriting a write-protected disk.</p>
