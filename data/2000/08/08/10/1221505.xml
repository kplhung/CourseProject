        <p>Joe Torre's office at Yankee Stadium fits a desk and a couch comfortably, but it probably felt a little cramped when he invited the burly Jose Canseco and Glenallen Hill to his office Tuesday, along with the smallish Luis Polonia.</p>
        <p>Torre asked the three players to bear with him until he could figure out exactly how he was going to use them all. But the reality of the matter, which Torre probably understood the moment he heard about the acquisition of Canseco, is that there are no perfect solutions.</p>
        <p>Torre wants to use David Justice as a designated hitter, to help with the injuries in his right leg. But he really cannot afford to do that. Justice is the Yankees' third-best outfielder, behind Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill, and left field in Yankee Stadium is not easy to play.</p>
        <p>Torre needs Justice's defense, because Canseco and Hill are poor outfielders who have rarely played there this year, and Polonia is subpar. And if Torre uses Polonia as his starting left fielder with Justice at designated hitter, then he could face a late-inning puzzle.</p>
        <p>If he pinch-hits for Polonia with Hill or Canseco, then one of those two players (or the utility man Clay Bellinger) would have to play left field the following inning, unless Torre was willing to insert Justice into left field, give up the D.H., and bat his pitcher.</p>
        <p>So until the Yankees' roster expands on Sept. 1 and more outfield help can be promoted from Class AAA Torre will probably have to use Justice extensively in left field and flip-flop Canseco, Hill and Polonia at D.H. ''I'm more concerned about getting Jose in the lineup,'' Torre said, ''because he's used to playing every day.''</p>
        <p>Soriano Out a Week</p>
        <p>Alfonso Soriano, the Yankees' most refined prospect, will miss a week after breaking the little finger of his throwing hand -- the latest in a series of injuries that have plagued the Yankees' prospects.</p>
        <p>Soriano, who has played shortstop and second base for Class AAA Columbus this year, will come back and probably be promoted to the major leagues after the Yankees' roster expands on Sept. 1.</p>
        <p>But there are a lot of prospects who will not play again this year, in a summer when the Yankees traded about a dozen young players in trades for the likes of David Justice, Denny Neagle, Glenallen Hill and Jose Vizcaino.</p>
        <p>Pitcher Adrian Hernandez -- the Cuban defector nicknamed El Duquecito because he patterned his pitching motion after that of Orlando Hernandez -- almost certainly will miss the rest of the season, after spraining his knee July 31. Hernandez could compete for a spot in the rotation next year.</p>
        <p>Nick Johnson, the first baseman once seen as the eventual replacement for Tino Martinez, has not played at all this year because of a soft tissue wrist injury. The Yankees do not know when he will play again.</p>
        <p>Wily Mo Pena, an outfielder given a huge signing bonus last year, is out with a knee injury, and outfielder Donzell McDonald, currently on the Yankees' 40-man roster, was out with a hand injury for most of the season, before recently rejoining Class AA Norwich. Todd Noel, a hard-throwing right-hander and a former No. 1 pick of the Chicago Cubs, has pitched only four games this year.</p>
        <p>A Visit From Dad</p>
        <p>Ed Cone had asked his son if he could come to New York to visit, and David Cone knew why. ''I think he's worried about me,'' the pitcher said.</p>
        <p>The son will pitch against the Athletics today, taking a 1-10 record to the mound. He has not won a game since April 28, and the Yankees have not posted a victory in any of his past 13 starts.</p>
        <p>As he worked out on the field yesterday, his father watched from the stands. The son is sure that his losing streak gnaws at Ed Cone, in a fatherly way.</p>
        <p>''But he's always upbeat around me, and trying to pick me up,'' David Cone said. ''It's been great having him around this week.''</p>
        <p>Strawberry Gets His Ring</p>
        <p>Joe Torre delivered Darryl Strawberry's 1999 championship ring to him at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center yesterday.</p>
        <p>''He was really pleased,'' Torre said. ''He's trying to appear optimistic and in good spirits. They're going to have to move him to a different room for all the flowers he's been getting.''</p>
