        <p>When Bridgestone/Firestone announced a recall yesterday of some 6.5 million Firestone tires, it was the company's first admission that the tires could pose a serious danger. But it was also a first step toward damage control.</p>
        <p>Twenty years is a long time, but memories of how a huge government-mandated recall in the late 1970's nearly bankrupted Firestone Tire and Rubber -- the company's name before the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan bought it in 1988 -- clearly resonate.</p>
        <p>''The oral history around here is that we were a lot too slow to cooperate back then,'' said Christine Karbowiak, a Firestone spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>This time, the company is recalling the tires without being forced -- though it withstood a week of withering news stories before acting. It has established a hot line for worried drivers to call, and it is offering to replace -- with virtually no questions asked -- the affected tires, regardless of how long they have been on the road.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important, Firestone is trying to define the problem as narrowly as possible, so that its brand is not tarnished as a whole. Though the recall includes all 15-inch Radial ATX and Radial ATX II tires, the focus is on Wilderness AT tires made at one Illinois plant.</p>
        <p>''They are isolating this so that, in the consumer's mind, this isn't a problem with Firestone tires, but a problem with 15-inch Wilderness tires made in a particular plant in Decatur,'' said Stephen Girsky, a tire industry analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''If they can keep this controlled and isolated, it won't have a significant long-term impact on their sales.''</p>
        <p>Still, plaintiffs' lawyers who have filed lawsuits -- more than 100, so far -- blaming the tires for serious injuries say Firestone in fact is stonewalling. In settling a number of suits over the last year, the company has insisted that the lawyers and their clients not talk about the cases.</p>
        <p>''I ask them for documents, they say, 'Sure, as long as you sign the usual protective order,' '' said Henry Wallace, a lawyer representing an injured client in Florida. ''Well, I won't sign, and other lawyers shouldn't either. My research shows there are at least 31 cases that are astoundingly similar to mine, and I should have access to their information.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Karbowiak, the Firestone spokeswoman, said it was common in business litigation to keep settlement agreements private. ''I am really resentful of the implication that there is anything untoward,'' she said. ''It is inflammatory.''</p>
        <p>The company also finds itself in less than total agreement with its customer of 100 years, the Ford Motor Company, millions of whose Explorer sport utility vehicles are equipped with the Firestone tires involved in the recall.</p>
        <p>At a news conference yesterday, Firestone and Ford offered contradictory advice about the optimum pressure for the tires. Firestone recommended 30 pounds per square inch; Ford suggested anywhere between 26 and 30 would be fine.</p>
        <p>The difference reflected the contrasting interests of automakers and tire makers. Automakers advise customers to keep tires fairly soft because this makes the ride less bouncy. That is particularly true for sport utility vehicles, which have stiff truck suspensions but are increasingly purchased by people more accustomed to the ride of a car.</p>
        <p>But soft tires, with more of their surface area in contact with the road, suffer more wear, so tire makers favor keeping their products inflated at higher pressure. ''Underinflated tires deteriorate more rapidly than tires that are properly maintained and are at an increased risk of tread separation, blowout or other failure,'' Firestone said.</p>
        <p>The conflicting advice prefigures what are likely to be two critical chapters in the episode: first, the government's determination of why the tires are failing, and then the apportionment of blame and financial responsibility. More immediately, it spurred expressions of frustration from plaintiffs' lawyers.</p>
        <p>''So now what is the consumer supposed to do?'' asked Tab Turner, a lawyer in Little Rock, Ark., who has 10 lawsuits filed against both companies.</p>
        <p>What had been a quiet issue for Firestone and Ford began to turn into a storm in February, when someone who had been injured in an accident involving a Ford Explorer with Firestone tires contacted KHOU, a local Houston television station. The station ran a segment on possible problems with the tires. Slowly, other stations picked up on the story.</p>
        <p>''Until that piece ran in Houston, we'd had maybe 30 or 40 complaints in 10 years,'' said Liz Neblett, a spokeswoman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. By the time the agency opened its investigation into the tires on May 2, it had 90 complaints of injuries related to ATX or Wilderness tires on Ford Explorers; as of yesterday morning, there were 270.</p>
        <p>''Now, whenever a story runs, there's another bump in the complaints,'' Ms. Neblett said.</p>
        <p>The flood of lawsuits seems unlikely to abate. The American Trial Lawyers Association has organized a litigation group around the Firestone tires, in which lawyers representing plaintiffs across the country can compare notes, and perhaps consolidate suits.</p>
        <p>Those lawyers are sure to resist the company's efforts to define the problem narrowly. Both Firestone and Ford said yesterday that evidence pointed to tires made at the Decatur plant as the proper focus of further investigation. But Mr. Turner and other plaintiffs' lawyers took issue with Firestone's plan to replace Wilderness tires made in Decatur with similar tires from other plants.</p>
        <p>''I've got a 35-year-old quadriplegic client on a ventilator, who got that way when a 1997 Ford Explorer rolled over after a rear tire separation,'' Mr. Turner said. ''That tire was made in Wilson, N.C., one of the plants that is supposed to provide those safe replacement tires.''</p>
        <p>Actually, the case against the tires may not be cut and dried. The same tires have been used on sport utility vehicles made by General Motors, Toyota and other manufacturers without a particularly high incidence of failure. Likewise, from 1995 through 1997, many Ford Explorers used tires made by Goodyear Tire and Rubber without undue problems with tread separations, according to Chuck Sinclair, a Goodyear spokesman. Moreover, Ford Explorers running on Firestone tires in cold-weather states do not seem to fail more often than other tires.</p>
        <p>Experts assessing the information available so far suspect that it is the combination of a burning sun, Ford Explorers, Firestone tires and drivers' failure to properly inflate them that can prove lethal.</p>
        <p>When a tire is underinflated, there is more flexing in the sidewall, which generates more heat. If the vehicle is carrying lots of people or an otherwise heavy load, the friction gets worse. Add hot weather and a hot road, and tire temperature can get critical. A good tire can generally endure temperatures as high as 210 degrees without mishap. But at 220 degrees, it can start to disintegrate.</p>
        <p>When that happens, even the best drivers often lose control of their cars. In such circumstances, the Explorer, with its high center of gravity, is more likely to roll over.</p>
        <p>''These vehicles are used by a lot of different people, in lots of driving conditions, and a lot of the ways they use it can lead to tire failure,'' said Marvin Bozarth, executive director of the International Tire and Rubber Association. ''I can probably walk out and spot five Explorers in half an hour that are running on underinflated tires. And if they are full of 200-pound people with all their luggage, the tires will heat up tremendously.''</p>
        <p>Whoever is ultimately held accountable for the problems with the tires, the companies with the most to gain are Firestone's competitors. Firestone may not have the capacity to make as many replacement tires as it needs for the recall; the company said Wednesday it would buy competitor's products if necessary.</p>
        <p>So far, tire companies are not using Firestone's woes as an opportunity to claim market share.</p>
        <p>''Firestone may be bearing the lion's share of the burden, but something like this is bad for the entire industry,'' Goodyear's Mr. Sinclair said. Indeed, Ms. Karbowiak, the Firestone spokeswoman, said she got a note from her counterpart at one competitive company, offering sympathy and asking how she could help.</p>
        <p>Still, other companies certainly will not turn sales away. Mr. Sinclair noted that Goodyear had been ''looking into our inventory and our manufacturing capabilities, to make sure we can meet customer demand.'' Indeed, analysts expect that Firestone's competitors have much to gain and little to lose by keeping low profiles right now.</p>
        <p>''Tire recalls happen all the time, and they know what goes around comes around, that if they go after Firestone brutally on this one, Firestone will go after them on the next,'' said Mr. Gwirsky of Morgan Stanley. ''And they'll probably gain share by default, anyway.''</p>
        <p>Investors clearly think so. On July 31, just before stories in USA Today called national attention to the problems, Bridgestone shares traded in Tokyo for 2,515 yen, or $23.32; yesterday, they closed at 2,075, a drop of 17 percent. By contrast, Goodyear's shares have gone up 18 percent in the same period, closing yesterday at $23.56.</p>
