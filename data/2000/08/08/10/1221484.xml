        <p>Clinton Fund-Raising Plans Rile Some in Gore Camp  The Clintons' intention to spend considerable time raising money for her Senate campaign and his presidential library during the Democratic convention in Los Angeles is rankling some Democratic fund-raisers and aides to Vice President Al Gore, who express concern that the Clinton events will siphon off Hollywood money better spent assisting the Gore-Lieberman ticket.</p>

        <p>Cheney Goes It Alone  Dick Cheney made his first solo campaign swing as the Republican vice presidential nominee, taking his ticket's message of ''compassionate conservatism'' to an inner-city homeless shelter in St. Louis and promising that a Bush administration would expand federal support for church-based social service groups.</p>

        <p>Incarceration Rate Slows  The population of state and federal prisons grew last year at the lowest rate since 1979, 3.4 percent, the Justice Department reported. Still, the number of Americans in all jails and prisons crossed the 2 million mark for the first time: 2,026,596.</p>

        <p>Bellhops Prevail in Bias Case  Nine bellhops -- all but one members of minorities -- who were fired from the Mondrian Hotel in Los Angeles in 1996 and replaced by whites will get $120,000 each under a settlement announced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>

        <p>Soft Money for First Lady  The national Democratic leadership has mounted an unusually early effort to promote Hillary Rodham Clinton's candidacy, channeling nearly $3 million into the state -- much of it from large, unregulated contributions.
