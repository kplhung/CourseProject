        <p>Britain's third-largest bank, Barclays P.L.C., said today that it was negotiating to acquire Woolwich P.L.C., a leading British mortgage lender, for about $:5.5 billion ($8.3 billion). A deal could be reached by the end of the week, executives close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>If the companies reach an agreement, it would strengthen the Barclays home mortgage business in Britain and accelerate its Internet banking strategy; Woolwich has been praised for its comprehensive Internet banking operation, which would be integrated into the Barclays system.</p>
        <p>Barclays, which only a few years ago was one of Britain's most troubled banks, has been on a tear in the last year under its chief executive Matthew Barrett, who took the bank's top job about 10 months ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett has eliminated 172 branches to reduce costs and has made several small acquisitions. The bank has also raised its profile in Britain with a $22 million advertising campaign starring actors like Sir Anthony Hopkins and Tim Roth.</p>
        <p>Barclays said that if it made a bid, it would value each share of Woolwich at 362 pence, a 34 percent premium over the closing share price Tuesday. Barclays said the offer would be in cash and stock: 0.1175 shares of Barclays and 164 pence in cash for each Woolwich share.</p>
        <p>Shares of Woolwich jumped 27 percent, or 72 pence, to 341 pence, or about $5.12. Shares of Barclays dropped 49 pence, or 2.9 percent, to 1,615 pence, or about $24.22.</p>
        <p>The Barclays play for Woolwich follows a recent battering in the mortgage lender's share price. Woolwich's shares reached a record low of 245 pence on July 31. The shares have rebounded a bit since then on speculation that the company could become a takeover target.</p>
        <p>A Barclays-Woolwich deal could set off another round of consolidation in the British banking industry. While more mega-deals like the Royal Bank of Scotland's recent acquisition of National Westminster Bank are not expected because of regulatory concerns, analysts said Britain's other mortgage lenders would become attractive takeover targets. The most watched mortgage lenders include Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Northern Rock. Almost across the board, shares of British mortgage lenders have been falling, making the group even more attractive.</p>
        <p>Credit Suisse First Boston is advising Barclays, and Schroder Salomon Smith Barney is advising Woolwich.</p>
