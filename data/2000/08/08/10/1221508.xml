        <p>The second-quarter profit for Canada's low-fare air carrier, Westjet Airlines Ltd. of Calgary, more than doubled as a result of Westjet's extending its service into eastern cities and higher passenger loads that reflected fears of a pilots' strike at Air Canada, the nation's major airline. Profit for the latest quarter jumped 154 percent to 7.4 million Canadian dollars ($5 million), or 17 cents a share, handily beating the estimate of 12 Canadian cents a share by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Revenue rose 77 percent, to 80.1 million Canadian dollars. Westjet increased its capacity by 54 percent in the first half to compete in new markets, and it plans to double the size of its 17-plane fleet.</p>
