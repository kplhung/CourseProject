        <p>Russian law enforcement officials said today they had detained a number of suspects in their investigation into the terrorist bombing of an underground pedestrian walkway that killed 7 and wounded 97 on Tuesday evening.

        <p>In an unusual rebuke to Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of Moscow, who was quick to attribute the bombing to Chechens fighting for independence from Russia, President Vladimir V.

        <p>Russian law enforcement officials said today they had detained a number of suspects in their investigation into the terrorist bombing of an underground pedestrian walkway that killed 7 and wounded 97 on Tuesday evening. But they said that so far none could be directly linked to the bombing in the heart of the Russian capital.</p>
        <p>In an unusual rebuke to Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of Moscow, who was quick to attribute the bombing to Chechens fighting for independence from Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin said today that ''it would be wrong'' to ''brand a whole people'' in the absence of proof of who was behind the bombing. The police and prosecutors also said they had no evidence of Chechen involvement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's admonition reflected the political sensitivities of Russian leaders who are trying to build a viable new government in Chechnya, said Aleksei Y. Zudin, a political analyst. The rush to judgment exemplified by Mayor Luzhkov's statements, he said, fed the worst suspicions of Chechen civilians, who have suffered through two rebellions and two devastating invasions by the Russian military since 1994.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zudin said that ''blame for this affair cannot be generalized to all Chechens,'' even if evidence gathered eventually points toward the rebellious republic, where rebel leaders have in recent weeks threatened to strike Russian cities.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Putin said Russia would complete its military campaign in Chechnya and ''finish off terrorists in their own den.''</p>
        <p>Overnight, combined Russian security forces said they had scoured 160 subway stations and underground passageways using bomb-sniffing dogs to ensure that the capital's public transit system was clear of explosives. At the Kazansky railway station here, the police reportedly found nearly nine pounds of TNT as well as seven detonators, which were not hooked up to the explosives.</p>
        <p>This morning, Muscovites were back underground as usual, with thousands of them passing through the reopened, though charred, passageways beneath Pushkin Square, where vendors picked through the debris in their shops.</p>
        <p>''Of course we will go back to work here,'' said a woman sorting through the lingerie in her darkened kiosk. ''And of course we are scared.''</p>
        <p>The low granite walls along the exits from the underground passageways had already become memorial altars, where friends, relatives and passers-by laid carnations and lilies to express their sympathy for those who died. Russian television reported tonight that Mr. Putin, too, had visited the square and laid flowers.</p>
        <p>Interior Ministry officials said today that seven people had died, contradicting a news agency report on Tuesday that said eight were killed.</p>
        <p>Police officials said they were working with three witnesses who saw two men bargaining at a leather goods shop in the tunnel and who dashed for an exit leaving behind a satchel, which exploded moments after the sales clerk summoned a security officer to inspect the bag.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin, speaking at the Kremlin, struck a note of calm resolution, admonishing Russians that terrorism was an ''international illness'' for which the only cure was ''political will,'' the ''vigilance of the people'' and effective law enforcement.</p>
        <p>Terrorists, he said, ''count on bloodshed, sensation, panic and hysteria.'' And he warned that ''disorganization and disorder would make the best possible gift for them.''</p>
