        <p>To understand why Japan expanded its whale hunting activities last month, despite international opposition, come to dinner at Taruichi, a festive whale-meat restaurant in Tokyo's trendy Shinjuku district.</p>
        <p>On a recent evening, not a seat or sake glass was empty in Taruichi as dozens of jovial patrons, ranging from business executives to domestic workers, feasted on the house specialties. There were 36 choices in all, including fried whale, raw whale, whale bacon, whale heart, whale testicle, whale kidney, and even ice cream made from the whale's fat.</p>
        <p>Many foreign governments and environmental groups opposed to Japan's stepped-up whaling efforts might have found the cuisine a bit, well, hard to swallow. But it was an evening of culinary bliss for Japanese diners, many of whom grew up eating whale and strongly defend it as part of their national culture and identity.</p>
        <p>''After the war, there was nothing to eat in Japan, and we would have starved if it were not for the whale bacon and steaks that the government provided us in school lunches,'' said Hiromi Kanomuri, a 47-year-old copywriter, who munched on pieces of whale skin.</p>
        <p>''We may eat the whale, but we also revere it,'' Mr. Kanomuri said. ''How can a total stranger tell us not to hunt whales without knowing how much this meat means to us?''</p>
        <p>The stranger to which Mr. Kanomuri so pointedly referred was the United States, which has threatened to impose sanctions on Japan for extending its whale hunts to include sperm and Bryde's whales, which are both protected under American endangered species laws. The Japanese already hunt minke whales, which are considered abundant enough to allow limited harvesting.</p>
        <p>Japan is a member of the International Whaling Commission, which adopted a ban on commercial whaling that took effect in 1986, but the convention allows signers to engage in limited hunts of whales for scientific purposes.</p>
        <p>Six Japanese whaling ships are now headed for the northwestern Pacific to hunt 160 minke as well as 50 Bryde's and 10 sperm whales in what has been billed as scientific research. It will be the first time since 1987 that Japan has hunted Bryde's and sperm whales, but few people outside Japan believe that the expedition is solely for research.</p>
        <p>Although Japan maintains that sperm and Bryde's whales are now populous enough to be hunted commercially, the international consensus is that not enough is known about these once depleted species to justify even scientific whaling.</p>
        <p>After a meeting in Tokyo with Foreign Minister Yohei Kono last week, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said that the United States was deeply troubled by Japan's decision to expand its hunt, which she said was ''contrary to whaling agreements.'' She said the United States would not hesitate to impose penalties. Under United States law, Washington can embargo imports from any nation that violates a marine conservation treaty.</p>
        <p>Britain also denounced Japan's whale hunt, as did several conservation groups, including the World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace. But the Japanese maintain that no one has the right to tell them what they should not eat.</p>
        <p>''Americans are a bunch of culinary imperialists,'' said Takashi Sato, Taruichi's owner. ''Telling the Japanese not to hunt whales is like telling the British to stop having their afternoon tea or denying French people their pate. This is how you start a war.''</p>
        <p>A jolly man of ample girth, Mr. Sato is fond of pounding his broad chest and proclaiming that he is made of ''100 percent whale meat,'' which he said he has eaten every day since he was old enough to chew.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Japanese have been hunting whales for more than 1,000 years, and dozens of shrines, regional festivals and religious ceremonies are centered on the whale. To be sure, the popularity of whale meat, which was a vital source of protein after World War II, has declined substantially in Japan in the years following the 1986 international moratorium on commercial whale hunts.</p>
        <p>But for many elderly and middle-aged Japanese, the whale is embedded in their taste buds, if not their psyches, and they are willing to pay a premium to eat it.</p>
        <p>Whale bacon costs about $150 a pound in gourmet food stores compared with $100 a pound for top-quality beef. Many Japanese are willing to shell out $50 to $80 a person to dine on whale meat delicacies in restaurants. A sliver of whale bacon about the size of a business card costs $5.</p>
        <p>''Eating whale is as symbolic and important to the Japanese as saving the whale is to us,'' said an American biologist who opposes Japanese whaling but acknowledges cultural differences in the way the two countries view the whale.</p>
        <p>''Our only hope is that younger generations of Japanese will see things differently,'' said the biologist, who is a member of the International Whaling Commission and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Japanese Fisheries Ministry officials dispute United States charges that Japan is violating international whaling treaties. The officials maintain that their whale hunts are permitted by the International Whaling Commission, which, when it banned commercial whaling, allowed whales to be killed for scientific purposes.</p>
        <p>Japan caught about 400 minke whales under the scientific research exemption last year. After the scientific data was collected, the whale meat was sold to fish markets and restaurants like Taruichi. Oil and other byproducts from the whales were used to make cosmetics and perfumes. The proceeds are used to help finance the research.</p>
        <p>Scientists from the Institute of Cetacean Research in Tokyo oversee the whaling expeditions. While the institute makes about $35 million a year from the sale of whale meat from its scientific catches, the research costs about $40 million a year. The institute receives a government subsidy of $5 million a year to offset its shortfall.</p>
        <p>Minoru Morimoto, Japan's whaling commissioner, said that Japan had resumed hunting sperm and Bryde's whales because research data suggested that their populations had sufficiently recovered to allow the scientific catches. Japan is particularly interested in understanding the eating habits of larger whales like these, which many Japanese scientists, Mr. Morimoto said, believe are diminishing Japan's seafood supply.</p>
        <p>While conservationists concede  that Japan's scientific expeditions can be justified under whaling commission rules, they maintain that Japan is using research whaling as a cover for commercial whaling because the meat ends up in the marketplace. They also say that the same research could be conducted without killing so many whales.</p>
        <p>''It's all one big facade,'' said Sanae Sida, a spokeswoman for the Greenpeace environmental group in Tokyo. ''With today's high technology and advances in science, the Japanese government expects us to believe that the only way to obtain this research is by killing the animals.''</p>
        <p>Several members of the International Whaling Commission's science committee said in interviews that they believed Japan could conduct its whaling research using nonlethal techniques like biopsy darts. The projectiles are used to retrieve a small amount of whale tissue, which is used for DNA testing.</p>
        <p>''DNA samples can tell us virtually everything we need to know about whale populations,'' said Michael F. Donoghue, a biologist for New Zealand's Conservation Department. ''You simply don't have to kill these animals anymore for science.''</p>
        <p>But Seiji Oshumi, director of the Cetacean Research Institute, said his researchers performed more than 100 different scientific tests on the whales, including determining toxicity levels of internal organs and stomach contents, which he said required the whales to be killed.</p>
        <p>While the legitimacy of Japan's scientific whale hunts is likely to be debated for some time, their immediate beneficiaries are ordinary Japanese like Naoshi Goto, a 66-year-old dentist, who recently enjoyed a bowl of whale soup at Taruichi.</p>
        <p>''As a child, we ate miso soup with whale meat every New Year's Eve,''  Mr. Goto said. ''It was a centuries-old tradition in my village. You can't imagine how precious this soup is to me right now.''</p>
