        <p>Editorial on Howard Safir's resignation as New York City police commissioner lauds his success in cutting crime rates; urges Mayor Rudolph W Guiliani to choose successor who can both keep crime rates low and deal expertly with frictions between police and minorities</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The resignation of Police Commissioner Howard Safir, New York City's 39th police chief, provides the opportunity to praise him for his dramatic success over the last four years in cutting crime rates to their lowest levels since the 1960's. It also offers a chance for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to choose the right successor to conclude his own term as mayor. Mr. Giuliani should pick someone who can not only keep crime rates low but also deal more expertly with the frictions between police and minorities that Mr. Safir leaves behind. It must be someone who can reassure all New Yorkers that keeping down crime does not involve a tradeoff in civil liberties.</p>
        <p>From the beginning of his tour of duty, it was clear that Commissioner Safir had agreed to leave the boasting rights about safer streets to Mr. Giuliani. The previous commissioner, William Bratton, had reaped much of the early credit for the drop in crime, never a wise move for a Giuliani underling. Mr. Bratton instituted computer tracking of crimes to deploy police where they were needed, and began a ''quality of life'' crackdown on lesser violations. Mr. Safir continued or expanded these ventures, but he also launched efforts of his own, including better training, special units to battle gangs and drugs and expanded use of DNA analysis to track criminals.</p>

        <p>The resignation of Police Commissioner Howard Safir, New York City's 39th police chief, provides the opportunity to praise him for his dramatic success over the last four years in cutting crime rates to their lowest levels since the 1960's. It also offers a chance for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to choose the right successor to conclude his own term as mayor. Mr. Giuliani should pick someone who can not only keep crime rates low but also deal more expertly with the frictions between police and minorities that Mr. Safir leaves behind. It must be someone who can reassure all New Yorkers that keeping down crime does not involve a tradeoff in civil liberties.</p>
        <p>From the beginning of his tour of duty, it was clear that Commissioner Safir had agreed to leave the boasting rights about safer streets to Mr. Giuliani. The previous commissioner, William Bratton, had reaped much of the early credit for the drop in crime, never a wise move for a Giuliani underling. Mr. Bratton instituted computer tracking of crimes to deploy police where they were needed, and began a ''quality of life'' crackdown on lesser violations. Mr. Safir continued or expanded these ventures, but he also launched efforts of his own, including better training, special units to battle gangs and drugs and expanded use of DNA analysis to track criminals.</p>
        <p>Still, on Mr. Safir's watch several high-profile incidents left minority New Yorkers alarmed about how often they are viewed as suspects and concerned that the price of lower crime rates was police harassment of immigrants, blacks and Hispanics. The police torture of the Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the more recent shootings of two unarmed black men, Amadou Diallo and Patrick Dorismond, raised questions about training, reporting of violations and the expansion of independent street crime units during Mr. Safir's term of office. The commissioner cited statistics showing an overall decline in police shootings, civilian complaints and brutality lawsuits during his tenure. But he seemed to miss the point that the city's minority communities were in a state of chronic fear about careless or hostile police tactics.</p>
        <p>With the departure of the mayor's loyal commissioner, Mr. Giuliani needs to choose a replacement who can take command of the nation's largest police department quickly. The new commissioner must oversee difficult negotiations with police unions and deal with the demands of federal and state investigators criticizing the department after the Louima and Diallo cases. And he or she must command respect not only from New York's 40,000-member police force but also from a diverse citizenry that wants to feel safe both from crime and from the fear of excessive police tactics.</p>
