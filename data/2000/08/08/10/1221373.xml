        <p>The new parking structure at Disneyland in Anaheim can lay claim, for now, to being the world's largest. (A bigger one is already going up at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.) Completed this month, the Disney structure has 10,000 parking spaces and is 1,174 feet in length, longer than the Chrysler Building is tall. Walt Disney Imagineering chose a surprising design architect for this quotidian building, Harry Wolf (consulting for the architect, Walker Parking Consultants), an auteur of spare, geometric buildings. The goal, says Tom Kozlowski, director of master planning for Disney Imagineering, was to design something utilitarian in ''the tradition of great public works.''</p>
