        <p>CAN'T YOU HEAR ME CALLIN'  The Life of Bill Monroe, Father of Bluegrass  By Richard D. Smith  Illustrated. 365 pages. Little, Brown &amp; Company. $25.95</p>
        <p>Bill Monroe was a mandolin virtuoso, an unforgettable singer, a visionary bandleader, a brilliant judge of musicians and the songwriter behind ''Blue Moon of Kentucky.'' He was also a skinflint, a womanizer and man who could hold a grudge for decades. Richard D. Smith, a journalist and mandolinist who wrote ''Bluegrass: An Informal Guide,'' chronicles the great musician and his messy life in ''Can't You Hear Me Callin','' and his reverence for Monroe's music doesn't keep him from mentioning the unflattering details.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith makes bold claims for Monroe, calling him ''the most broadly talented and broadly influential figure in American popular music history.'' Partisans of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Robert Johnson, Hank Williams, Bob Dylan, James Brown and others might well disagree. But Monroe clearly belongs in the American pantheon.</p>
        <p>He single-handedly turned rural string-band music, with a touch of the blues, into bluegrass: music that brought together high, lonesome harmony singing with an aggressive beat and breakneck instrumental virtuosity. His repertory brought together Southern ballads, gospel songs and dance tunes, professionalizing them and revving them up to reach an audience that eventually spanned the world. Monroe's bluegrass -- named after his band, the Blue Grass Boys -- is a cornerstone of country music and, in turn, of rock.</p>
        <p>For ''Can't You Hear Me Callin','' Mr. Smith has gone through small-town records, farm ledgers, interview transcripts, bootleg recordings and legal documents; he has interviewed not only Monroe's musicians but also his ex-girlfriends. It is a meticulously researched and footnoted biography, intent on straightening out chronologies and pinning down apocryphal stories. It also looks into Monroe's music, connecting songs to the people and landscapes that inspired them and explaining, without getting too technical, Monroe's innovations and his evolution.</p>
        <p>Monroe, born in 1911, was the eighth and youngest child of a farm family in Rosine, Ky. He was born cross-eyed, a defect that was not surgically corrected until he was a teenager; other children teased him, and he grew up shy. His father was hard-working and distant, his mother nurtured him, and his brothers were rowdy. Mr. Smith psychologizes, perhaps too neatly, that the family set the pattern for Monroe's later personality: affectionate with women, stoic and competitive with men.</p>
        <p>Bill's older brothers Charlie and Birch took up the family's prized instruments, the guitar and fiddle, leaving Bill with the lowly mandolin. It had been used mostly for backup. But Bill Monroe turned it into a brilliant solo instrument with fierce runs, blues bends and sharply syncopated rhythm chords.</p>
        <p>He worked with Charlie as a duo on the grueling country circuit of daytime radio shows and nighttime concerts. In 1936 the Monroe Brothers began recording for RCA Victor, tearing into the old mountain songs in performances still cherished by country aficionados. Two years later they went separate ways; Mr. Smith determinedly debunks old rumors that Charlie made advances on Bill's wife. On his own Bill Monroe began putting together the music that would start its own tradition.</p>
        <p>Monroe's new music crystallized in 1945, when the Blue Grass Boys included a singing guitarist named Lester Flatt and took on a new banjo player, Earl Scruggs. His three-finger picking style originated in North Carolina, but he took it to a new plateau of virtuosity, surrounding a melody with a shower of arpeggios. Monroe had perfected a rhythm that seemed to jump ahead of the beat, and with Monroe, Scruggs and a fiddler named Chubby Wise, songs became contests among virtuoso soloists. Bluegrass was part of a postwar renaissance of American music: brash, gutsy and built for speed.</p>
        <p>But it couldn't withstand the commercial onslaught of honky-tonk country and of rock 'n' roll. Monroe's fortunes declined in the 1950's, only to be revived through an unlikely ally: the folklorist Ralph Rinzler, who repositioned Monroe in the folk revival.</p>
        <p>Bluegrass, which had not long before been a vanguard music, was greeted by Northern folk fans as a noble tradition. Monroe moved on to the college and folk festival circuit; his bands began to include Yankees, some of whom -- the guitarist Ry Cooder (who played banjo in the Blue Grass Boys), the guitarist and singer Peter Rowan and the fiddler Richard Greene -- would go on to find a place in California rock and country-rock. By the 1970's, there was a growing circuit of bluegrass festivals where Monroe was venerated. He was a barnstormer, staying on the road until a stroke felled him in March 1996; he died that September.</p>
        <p>Along the way Monroe left his wife and children for a series of overlapping affairs; the women, Mr. Smith notes in passing, stayed in touch with Monroe afterward, even those who sued him. Monroe made misguided investments; he received songwriting credit on his sidemen's work. He didn't speak to Flatt or Mr. Scruggs for more than 20 years after they left his band to become rivals. Mr. Smith patiently sorts out the squabbles, usually taking Mr. Monroe's side or pointing out that he came from an era when things were done differently. Eventually, however, he grows exasperated with Monroe's obtuseness in business matters.</p>
        <p>For all its information, Mr. Smith's biography is unable to reanimate Monroe's character. And while he had access to the extensive interviews Rinzler did for a book he never wrote, Mr. Smith uses too little of Monroe's own terse, cantankerous voice. Monroe remains a bundle of paradoxes: heartfelt and stone-faced, ruthless and kindly. He was hardly the first great artist who turns out to have been a user of the people around him. And Monroe's songs, with their constant tensions amid poker-faced control, speed-fingered exuberance and abiding pain, still dole out his story in three-minute revelations.</p>
