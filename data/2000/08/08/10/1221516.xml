        <p>Conoco said yesterday that it would sell fuel on the American Petroleum Exchange, an Internet-based wholesale market for gasoline and diesel fuel. The exchange, which is scheduled to open in early September, will function as a reverse auction, with customers listing their fuel needs and suppliers, like Conoco, bidding for the contracts. A Conoco spokeswoman said the company had not set aside a specific amount of fuel to sell through the exchange, noting that volume would be determined by demand.</p>
