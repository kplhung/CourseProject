        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani acknowledged for the first time last night, in a television interview, that he had known about his father's criminal activity, which was revealed in a book published last month. The mayor said his father's mistakes had influenced him to go into law enforcement.</p>
        <p>''Some of it I knew, some of it I suspected,'' Mr. Giuliani said of the accounts in the book, ''Rudy! An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani,'' by Wayne Barrett.</p>
        <p>The book describes Harold Giuliani's prison term for the armed robbery of a milkman and contends that the elder Giuliani was an enforcer for his brother-in-law's loan-sharking operation. ''Some of it,'' the mayor said, ''did come as a shock.''</p>
        <p>Until yesterday, Mr. Giuliani, a former United States attorney, had refused to answer recent questions about his father, other than to defend him as scrupulously honest and the ''finest man'' he had ever known.</p>
        <p>But last night, in an interview on ''New York Close-Up'' on NY1 with Sam Roberts, the program's host and deputy editor of the Week in Review section of The New York Times, the mayor opened up a little.</p>
        <p>He refused, however, to say just what he knew and when he knew it.  ''Some of it I knew, some of it I suspected, some of it I absolutely didn't know, and when I write my book, I'll explain which is which,'' he said with a chuckle.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Barrett's book, in 1934, a decade before the mayor's birth, Harold Giuliani, with an accomplice, pulled a gun on a milkman in a Manhattan building, robbed him of $128.82, and gave a false name to the police when he was arrested. He served a year and a half at Sing Sing.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani, who claims not to have read the book, said that his father was ''compulsive about being honest,'' perhaps to compensate for his past deeds.</p>
        <p>''He would tell me, 'Never take anybody else's money, make sure you always pay for things, make sure that you don't make a mistake when you fill out a form, make sure it's accurate,' '' the mayor said. ''I've driven myself crazy over this all my life. And when any mistake has been made it really bothers me, and I realize more than I did as I was growing up why my father was doing that. I mean, he wanted to make sure that I didn't make the same mistakes that he believed he had made.''</p>
        <p>When asked if his father's criminal past had influenced him to go into law enforcement, Mr. Giuliani replied, ''I'm sure it did.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett's book also said that several of the mayor's cousins were involved in organized crime, and the mayor said that his parents' decision to move to Long Island was in part an attempt to get him away from an unsavory environment.</p>
        <p>''I think the decision that my father and mother made, essentially, was to take me out of Brooklyn, where they thought I could get into trouble,'' he said, ''and keep me away from some of the things that I guess my father was worried about.''</p>
