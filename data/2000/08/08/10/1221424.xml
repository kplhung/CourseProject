        <p>The Giants are thin at nearly every position, and units that routinely tap their depth are especially weakened.</p>
        <p>That was one reason for the special teams' problems last week against the Chicago Bears. And lack of experience will also play a crucial role on the nickel defense, where Emmanuel McDaniel is the elder statesman, despite having spent the first 10 weeks of last season on the Giants' practice squad.</p>
        <p>But McDaniel would like everyone to please refrain from using the word inexperienced to describe the Giants, especially in referring to those who share the nickel cornerback duties with him.</p>
        <p>''All three of us can play that position,'' McDaniel said today. ''Me personally, I'm just tired of everyone saying inexperienced. I feel like all three of us can play the position just as good as anyone in the league.''</p>
        <p>That remains to be seen. McDaniel is the first-string nickel cornerback ahead of Reggie Stephens and the rookie Ralph Brown. But none of them have held the position long term in the National Football League.</p>
        <p>McDaniel is a fourth-year player who did not play with the Giants last season until injuries forced the team to activate him. With four cornerbacks sidelined, McDaniel started at nickel cornerback and then cornerback when Jason Sehorn broke his left leg against the Jets.</p>
        <p>Stephens, who signed as a rookie free agent out of Rutgers last year, spent all of last season on the practice squad and has yet to play in a professional game. He has never played nickel cornerback. Neither has Brown, the Giants' fifth-round pick out of Nebraska.</p>
        <p>John Fox, the defensive coordinator, conceded that McDaniel had begun the preseason as the top nickel back, but did not discount the possibility of somebody else winning the job. Fox was pleased with the performance of all three players against the Bears but is eager to see how they fare Friday against the Jacksonville Jaguars and their two standout receivers, Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell.</p>
        <p>Injuries have depleted the Giants' secondary and increased the need for the young players. Conrad Hamilton's release before camp, because of a knee injury, has elevated Dave Thomas to starting cornerback and created a vacancy at nickel cornerback.</p>
        <p>It is a dangerous mix at a position that is used for passing situations, meaning the bulk of the defensive time. The Giants also require their nickel to take over some of the linebacker responsibilities.</p>
        <p>''You got to think more,'' McDaniel said. ''You have to know where your help is. It's not easy at all.''</p>
        <p>Fox agreed. ''It'd be like taking a rookie and making him learn two different positions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Most rookie defensive backs started at cornerback in college and have yet to play the nickel.</p>
        <p>''It's still football,'' Stephens said. ''You just have to learn the ins and outs of it and come to all the reps. I think it'll come to all of us.''</p>
        <p>Fox said McDaniel is tenacious with excellent quickness, but lacks size. The Giants' starting secondary is imposing with the 6-foot-2-inch Sehorn and the 6-3 Thomas at the corners and the 6-3 Sam Garnes and the 6-2 Shaun Williams playing safety.</p>
        <p>McDaniel and Stephens are each 5-9 and Brown is 5-10. Today, Brown was beaten for a touchdown by Jeremy Watkins, a 5-11 rookie free agent.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Giants on Wednesday agreed to continue their training camp at SUNY-Albany through 2003. The original deal, signed in 1996, expires this summer. Despite decreased attendance, the Giants opted to stay rather than return to Fairleigh Dickinson in Madison, N.J., because they are pleased with the quality and layout of the workout fields. The Giants' executive vice president, JOHN MARA, said the length of the new deal is not meant to be a bridge to a possible move to a new facility at Monmouth University in West Long Branch, N.J., which he had mentioned. ''There's no particular significance to that,'' Mara said. ''I don't know if it's going to be three years or five years. And even if it were, frankly, it's going to take a lot to get us out of here.'' . . . Fullback GREG COMELLA (tight back) returned to practice. . . . Wide receiver JOE JUREVICIUS (bruised right shoulder) had his arm out of a sling but missed practice again, although COACH JIM FASSEL did not rule him out for Friday's game at Jacksonville. . . . Fassel called tight end DAN CAMPBELL (strained left hamstring) iffy for the game. . . . Defensive tackle KEITH HAMILTON (strained hamstring) and linebacker MIKE BARROW (sprained knee) will not play Friday. . . . Fassel substituted a morning workout with meetings after giving the team Tuesday night off and had players practice in lightweight pads in the afternoon. That didn't prevent him from scolding them after practice. ''I didn't think we practiced well today and I told them that,'' he said.</p>
