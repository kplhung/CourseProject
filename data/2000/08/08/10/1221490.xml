        <p>Vice President Al Gore and his new Democratic running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, introduced each other to the folks back home today in a pair of appearances that sought to  ground two men with disparate stories in the common embrace of family and community.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore and his new Democratic running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, introduced each other to the folks back home today in a pair of appearances that sought to  ground two men with disparate stories in the common embrace of family and community.</p>
        <p>The day began in Carthage, Tenn., the picturesque town on the Cumberland plateau that was one of Mr. Gore's two boyhood homes -- the other being Washington, D.C. Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper, gave Mr. Lieberman and his family a tour of the house they have owned in Carthage since 1973 and then dropped by the farm where he spent his childhood summers and where his 87-year-old mother, Pauline, still lives.</p>
        <p>Then, as campaign cameras recorded the scene for possible use in television commercials, longtime friends and constituents sang Mr. Gore's praises during a scripted gathering in an elementary-school gymnasium. This afternoon, the Gores and Liebermans flew to Stamford, where Mr. Lieberman returned the favor by joining the Gores at a raucous rally with local supporters.</p>
        <p>''What a thrill to come home to Stamford on Air Force II,'' Mr. Lieberman said.</p>
        <p>In Carthage, Mr. Gore vowed that he and Mr. Lieberman would not level personal attacks against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee, and his running mate, Dick Cheney. ''I will not say a single unkind word about Governor Bush or Dick Cheney,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Exactly how Mr. Gore will define ''unkind word'' remains to be seen, and his pledge was greeted skeptically by Mr. Bush's aides. They noted that Mr. Gore has used loaded terms like ''reckless,'' ''risky,'' ''irresponsible,'' ''smug'' and ''arrogant'' to describe Mr. Bush's policies.</p>
        <p>In a conversation with reporters aboard Air Force II en route to Connecticut, Mr. Gore said he had ''never made a personal attack against Governor Bush.'' He then said he had once ''slipped'' when, in May, he called Mr. Bush's Social Security proposals arrogant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore made a similar pledge in the primaries, saying he would not make any negative personal attacks against his Democratic opponent, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. But Mr. Gore proved quite skillful at casting Mr. Bradley in derogatory terms without calling him names, though he did call him a ''quitter'' for leaving the Senate.</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said that ''if the vice president meant what he said it would be a breakthrough encouraging development.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, 52, was born in Washington, where his father served in the House and Senate, and he attended all but part of one year of his schooling there. But he spent summers on his parents' farm in Carthage and has returned there to kick off his campaigns.</p>
        <p>The event in Carthage was so prepackaged that, hours beforehand, Gore aides handed out biographies of the townspeople whom Mr. Gore had called on to speak. Many told stories of medical problems -- a child with cancer, a kidney transplant -- and paid tribute to Mr. Gore for riding to the rescue with helpful legislation during his 16 years in Congress.</p>
        <p>One man, Mark Thompson, of Cleveland, Tenn., told of riding his bicycle as a boy to deliver a letter to then-Senator Gore seeking help in securing Social Security benefits for his grandmother. And as Mr. Thompson credited Mr. Gore for fixing the problem, he incorporated the campaign's theme of the week -- ''going the distance for America's working families.''</p>
        <p>''Mr. Vice President, in 1989 you went the distance for my family,'' he said. ''And I know in November when you're elected president of the United States you're going to go the distance for families all across this country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore responded, ''We need to get you to come on the campaign trail'' -- as if that were not exactly where Mr. Thompson was today.</p>
        <p>The only comment that was off script today came from Laura Lester, a 55-year-old retired teacher who asked Mr. Lieberman about his support for school vouchers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman supports pilot programs that would provide federal money to the parents of poor children to pay for tuition at private schools, one of several areas in which he disagrees with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman used the question to blunt Bush campaign attacks about their differences on various issues, as they have in several interviews in the last 24 hours.</p>
        <p>''You know,'' Mr. Lieberman said, ''the folks on the other side are trying to point out the differences between Al and me and, believe me, the differences are very, very few.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said the two did have some differences. ''This is one,'' he said of vouchers. ''And I think it's a mark of the strength of leadership of this man that he didn't choose somebody who agreed with him on every single issue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said he would occasionally offer dissenting advice to Mr. Gore but would ''support him wholeheartedly'' once a decision was made. Then Mr. Gore jumped in.</p>
        <p>''I'm not afraid to have a vice president who disagrees with me on some issues,'' he said. ''I think that's fine. Our administration will be opposed to private school vouchers. I'm against them. I think they drain money away from public schools.</p>
        <p>''But I'll tell you this. I think it is a strength and not a weakness, an asset and not a liability, to be able to have a different point of view represented in the room at the time that decisions are being made.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman addressed another issue where they differ, parental consent and notification for minors seeking abortions, in a morning television interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, who supports abortion rights, said on NBC's Today program that he would support legislation giving parents the right to be notified about or to consent to a minor child's abortion, but only if it contained provisions allowing the child to seek permission for the abortion from a judge ''when it can't be worked out in the family.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who also supports abortion rights, has always opposed parental-consent legislation, aides said, but he said today he had expressed ''a willingness to look at proposals'' that do not impinge on a woman's right to choose. Gore aides later said he was only discussing parental notification, not parental consent, and that he had never seen a notification bill with adequate protections.</p>
