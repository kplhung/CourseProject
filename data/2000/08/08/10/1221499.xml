        <p>Presi dents hand out plenty of perks  ambassadorships, invitations to state dinners and specially made boxes of M&amp;M's bearing the presidential seal.</p>
        <p>With just five months left in his term, and his opportunities for presenting awards dwindling, President Clinton today awarded 15 people  with Presidential Medals of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor. Some of the awards seemed to represent belated presidential thank-yous. Some clearly had a political twist. At least one was a consolation prize.</p>
        <p>In announcing the awards, Mr. Clinton said he had huddled with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate in New York,  to review the upstanding people from all walks of life nominated by aides and others.</p>
        <p>The honorees included John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard economist, Msgr. George G. Higgins, a labor activist, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is Mr. Clinton's envoy to Africa.</p>
        <p>Although the selection process is cloaked in mystery, Mrs. Clinton perhaps had a role in advocating for Marian Wright Edelman, her first boss at the Children's Defense Fund; the Rev. Gardner C. Taylor, a prominent pastor from Brooklyn who has backed her campaign; and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the man she hopes to succeed in the Senate.</p>
        <p>The award was a consolation prize for Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who was NATO's supreme commander during the bombing of Yugoslavia but who was passed over for the post of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Now an investment banker, General Clark wore a suit instead of a uniform but still stood ramrod straight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, over the course of his presidency, has handed out 83 of the gold medallions decorated with red, white and blue. There are no limits to the number of medals that can be awarded, and although the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said this was the final medal ceremony of the year, he added, ''The president always reserves the right to do something on a more ad-hoc basis near the end of the administration.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has always reached out to Republicans when presenting the awards. Bob Dole won the honor the year after he lost to Mr. Clinton in the 1996 presidential race. Former President Gerald R. Ford joined former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, in in 1999. This year, Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, won the award posthumously. Mr. Chafee died in October.</p>
        <p>The other honorees were Simon Wiesenthal, the Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter; Cruz Reynoso, a former judge from California who is vice chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights; George McGovern, a former Democratic presidential nominee; James Edward Burke, chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America; Adm. William Crowe, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Mildred Jeffrey, a labor activist; and Mathilde Krim, founder of the American Foundation for AIDS Research.</p>
        <p>''It's the highest honor of my life,'' said Mr. McGovern said. ''I treasure it even more than running for the presidency of the United States. If I had won, that would have been the greatest honor.''</p>
        <p>Then, of course, he would have been the one handing out medals.</p>
