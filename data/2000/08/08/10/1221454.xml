        <p>Patrick J. Buchanan arrived here today full of optimism and bravado, predicting that he would claim the Reform Party presidential nomination, despite a bitter split that could leave the party nominating not one, but two, candidates for president.</p>
        <p>Forces allied for and against Mr. Buchanan tried several times today to resolve their differences, but the split remained so profound that a settlement by the opening gavel on Thursday was highly unlikely.</p>
        <p>''We are on our way,'' Mr. Buchanan said on his arrival to a cheering crowd of 100 supporters at his hotel. ''We will give you the fight of our lives. This convention belongs to us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan's rival for the nomination, John Hagelin, made no public appearances here today.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the two sides met briefly this morning to consider the possibility of a settlement. But the meeting ended quickly without resolution, leaving each side to plot its own course over the next several days and beyond, all with an eye toward the $12.6 million in federal campaign funds to which the party nominee is entitled.</p>
        <p>The two sides met again this afternoon but their talks broke off once more without making progress. Officials on both sides said they did not expect a breakthrough before the convention opened.</p>
        <p>The party effectively split during a meeting of national committee members on Tuesday, when opponents of Mr. Buchanan, about a quarter of the 120 attending, stormed out of the room, accusing his supporters of stealing control of the party. Those who remained branded the protesters as sore losers, even as those who left set up a national committee and an executive committee of their own.</p>
        <p>By today, the absence of any conciliation made it clear that both sides were digging in, wholly resistant to any opposing arguments.</p>
        <p>In dueling news conferences, each side used different criteria to make its case for legitimacy, and in the surest sign yet that the party was operating along parallel tracks, the anti-Buchanan group registered its delegates at a table in the Long Beach Convention Center lobby, after which the pro-Buchanan forces registered theirs.</p>
        <p>Throughout the day, if there was any point of agreement it was this: A continuing split would almost guarantee that the ultimate arbiters would be the Federal Election Commission, and in all likelihood, a federal court.</p>
        <p>With the 596 convention delegates arriving today, the question was not so much which candidate, Mr. Buchanan or Mr. Hagelin, would receive the campaign money as much as which ruling group was legitimately in control of the party and, by extension, the convention, which ends on Sunday.</p>
        <p>By sheer numbers, the Buchanan side seemed to hold an advantage. Gerald M. Moan, the party chairman whose stewardship of the national committee meeting precipitated the walkout, said that his control of $2.5 million in federal money to stage the convention made him and his followers -- almost all of them Buchanan supporters -- the rightful claimants to authority.</p>
        <p>''They can say anything they wish,'' Mr. Moan said of his opponents. ''But I am the chairman.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Bay Buchanan, the candidate's sister and chief strategist, said that by her count, Mr. Buchanan had control of 410 delegates, more than enough to defeat Mr. Hagelin, should it come to that. In the Reform Party, a candidate can ask that the primary vote, a monthlong process that concludes this week, be set aside in favor of a delegate vote.</p>
        <p>The anti-Buchanan forces contended that they represented a majority of the party's original 11-member executive committee and had proof that, as part of the primary balloting process, Mr. Buchanan violated party rules by sending ballots to ineligible voters.</p>
        <p>Accusing Mr. Moan and the Buchanan campaign of ''brown-shirt tactics'' that included physical assaults on party members on Tuesday, Jim Mangia, the party secretary, said that as far as his side was concerned, Mr. Buchanan was disqualified from the primary.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Mangia said, Mr. Moan's side had acknowledged the authority of the executive committee that Mr. Mangia is now running, by voting on Tuesday to void any actions that committee takes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moan dismissed that contention, saying, ''Their executive committee is irrelevant.''</p>
        <p>Russell J. Verney, the party's founding chairman who is now aligned with the forces opposed to Mr. Buchanan, predicted that the warring factions would not find accommodation, making it all but certain the party would make dual requests to the election commission for the campaign money.</p>
        <p>That, Mr. Verney said, could work to his side's advantage if the election commission chooses to investigate charges that Mr. Buchanan's campaign submitted illegal names.</p>
        <p>''At some point,'' Mr. Verney said, referring to the six commission members, ''they are going to have to go back and look at the many activities that have gone on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan and his sister spoke as if the federal money was already on the way to them. Speaking to reporters, Ms. Buchanan said she expected that her campaign would receive the money within three weeks, an inevitability the other side has not accepted.</p>
        <p>''Ideally, I would have hoped these people would have heard the fat lady sing 30 days ago,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She said that the Buchanan campaign had plans to use almost all the federal money on a media campaign, mostly radio, starting after Labor Day and aiming at specific states, which she declined to identify.</p>
        <p>By that strategy, she said, Mr. Buchanan's popularity would begin to rise from as little as 1 percent in some recent polls to double digits, an ascent that would almost surely affect the fortunes of the Republican ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.</p>
        <p>That effort, she added, would be immeasurably aided if a court rules that Mr. Buchanan, and perhaps the other leading third-party candidate, Ralph Nader of the Green Party, should be allowed to participate in the presidential debates this fall.</p>
        <p>''The debates are critical,'' Ms. Buchanan said. ''I'm hoping that we can just start clicking, get into the debates and win this election, even.''</p>
