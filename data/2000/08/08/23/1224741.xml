        <p>IT was pouring and I was seriously sleep-deprived the morning I took the Liberal Arts and Sciences Test, New York State's main certification exam for teachers. I had signed up for the four-hour test on a whim, but when my alarm clock blared at 6:45 on July 15 -- a Saturday, no less -- I rued my bright idea.</p>
        <p>I was not looking to switch careers. As an education reporter covering New York City schools, I had grown curious about the test, which I had written about in my first year on the beat. In one front-page story, I had reported that nearly a third of the city's teachers had failed the certification exam at least once. Yet several experienced teachers had told me the test was ridiculously easy.</p>
        <p>I yearned for the truth.</p>
        <p>So on that rain-soaked morning, I dragged myself to Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn to see for myself. For the record, I had not taken a standardized test since 1986, as a high school senior.</p>
        <p>At Murrow, I waited in line behind hundreds of other New Yorkers anxious to prove they were fit to teach. Some, I knew from my reporting, had failed the test repeatedly yet were still working as uncertified teachers, the kind the state is pressuring the city to get rid of.</p>
        <p>But at least they came prepared. Everybody but me, it seemed, had a fistful of sharpened No. 2 pencils. I had just one, which I unearthed in a frantic search of my apartment.</p>
        <p>That was not the only way I was ill-prepared. While others had spent weeks poring over test prep manuals, I had taken a single practice exam. The questions had rattled me.  You needed to remember the five pillars of Islam, understand osmosis and know whether barbed wire was invented before the telephone. The math was so beyond me that I skipped five questions. (It harked back to trigonometry class, which I had not thought about since 1985.)</p>
        <p>The Liberal Arts and Sciences Test is the most general of three exams that teacher candidates have to pass to get a state teaching license. It supposedly measures knowledge of basic math and science, history and the arts and humanities. It also asks you to read and answer questions about literary passages and newspaper articles, makes sure your grammar is correct and tests your writing skills with an essay assignment.</p>
        <p>Fair enough. As it turned out, though, the real thing was considerably less taxing than my practice test. The exam was tedious and long, with 80 multiple-choice questions plus the essay, and more than a little frustrating. I cannot reveal the actual questions, because the state asked me not to. But I will say that some -- especially those that asked me to interpret works of art or literary passages -- seemed to have more than one right answer. For other questions, I was convinced that none of the supplied answers was right.</p>
        <p>Curiously, the math was more manageable than I expected. You basically had to know how to multiply, divide, read graphs and do simple algebra equations. Determining the original price of a sale item given the rate of discount, for example.</p>
        <p>I also breezed through the section testing communications skills. Analyzing newspaper excerpts, weighing objectivity, interpreting figurative language and identifying grammatical and structural errors came easily. But by the time I got to the essay section, my pencil was worn to the nub. Moreover, the assignment -- to opine on whether the rich should be taxed at a higher rate than the poor -- made my eyes glaze over.</p>
        <p>I ignored instructions to outline my essay on scrap paper first. I just started writing, breathlessly making the case for a higher tax rate as if I were dashing off a newspaper article on a crushing deadline.</p>
        <p>Afterward I sped home for a long nap, and put the rather dismal experience out of my head until my scores arrived in the mail this week.</p>
        <p>The good news: I passed, with a scaled score of 284 out of a possible 300. (You need at least a 220.) But on closer examination, my results made little sense. I got a perfect score, 300, on the science and math section -- bizarre, considering that I failed precalculus in high school and never took another science course after tenth-grade chemistry. I am mortified to report that my worst score -- a 260 -- was on the essay.</p>
        <p>What all this says about the state certification exam, I'm not sure. If my experience is any indication, it is  not the best measure of someone's academic strengths and weaknesses. And as with all standardized tests, performance might depend more on your state of mind the day you take it than on your intellectual prowess.</p>
        <p>Still, it's not a bad idea to make sure teachers can figure percentages, form a scientific hypothesis, recognize symbolism in a short story and, yes, write a well-organized essay. If I were in charge, I would probably make it a little tougher. There is just no excuse for someone like me to get a perfect score in math.</p>
        <p>But that could prove disastrous. Of the 4,315 people who took the exam on July 15 in the city, a whopping 59 percent failed, according to the state. Although it is not perfect, the exam seems a necessary gatekeeping device for a profession whose purpose is imparting knowledge.</p>
        <p>I approve, and hope that I never have to take it again.</p>
