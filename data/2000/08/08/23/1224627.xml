        <p>THANK goodness for Yankee Stadium. Had it not been for the ballpark in the South Bronx, and its Tiffany-priced hot dogs, I never would have found the Feeding Tree just a few blocks away.</p>
        <p>A friend took me there last year before the third game of the World Series, saying it was cheaper and better than a meal in the stands, where, this year at least, a 32-ounce bottle of water can run $5. I was excited, to say the least, watching the Yanks come back to beat the Braves, but I was almost as happy with my pregame meal at this casual West Indian restaurant.</p>

        <p>THANK goodness for Yankee Stadium. Had it not been for the ballpark in the South Bronx, and its Tiffany-priced hot dogs, I never would have found the Feeding Tree just a few blocks away.</p>
        <p>A friend took me there last year before the third game of the World Series, saying it was cheaper and better than a meal in the stands, where, this year at least, a 32-ounce bottle of water can run $5. I was excited, to say the least, watching the Yanks come back to beat the Braves, but I was almost as happy with my pregame meal at this casual West Indian restaurant.</p>
        <p>I hadn't been back to the Feeding Tree until I went to another game this summer, but it was as good as I remembered, good enough that I've now eaten there on a quieter, less hurried occasion, when the Yankees were out of town.</p>
        <p>The Feeding Tree looks like a bright takeout place, with a counter over a glass display case with assorted Jamaican groceries. A few tables are scattered about where you can sit with your takeout containers and eat with plastic utensils. But to the right of the counter is a closed door leading to a trim dining room, with sleek Formica tables and chairs, some green plants and a glossy bar. Two televisions are always on, tuned in to anything from reggae videos to the nightly news, or even the opera.</p>
        <p>The touchstone of a Jamaican restaurant is its jerk, and Feeding Tree's jerk chicken ($7) is excellent, subtly spiced with thyme, allspice and chilies, which add dimension to the chicken as the heat slowly builds in the mouth. It is not cooked over smoke, as would be traditional in Jamaica, but baked, the usual New York compromise, and served with an oniony brown gravy. I've had it with the gravy and without, and prefer it without, the better to savor the flavor of the chicken. As with all the main courses, the jerk comes with rice and peas (as kidney beans are called in Jamaica), an earthy and equally subtle counterpoint, as well as sweet plantains, not-too-sweet corn bread and a mixture of cabbage, carrots and green beans that is an antidote to the heat of the chilies.</p>
        <p>As good as the jerk is, it may not be the best dish on the menu. I would have to give that honor to the magnificently mellow curried goat ($6.50), tender chunks of meat in a mild green sauce. If you've never had goat, this is the one to try. Rich and beefy oxtail stew ($7.50) is almost as good, while beef stew ($7), or stew beef as it's called on the menu, is a good, peppery Caribbean version, with cassava added to the usual melange of carrots and potatoes. The only dish I haven't cared for is the overly bland curried shrimp ($7.50), although some hot sauce will help ''nice it up,'' as they say.</p>
        <p>Beer goes well with this food, but my favorite beverage is sorrel ($2.50), a sweet and spicy cold drink that has nothing to do with the sour herb but is made from the flowers of a plant in the hibiscus family, steeped with ginger, cloves and other flavorings. Service is slow-paced, though gentle and sweet, so leave time if you're there before a game or on a lunch break from the nearby County Courthouse.</p>
        <p>The Feeding Tree doesn't offer much in the way of dessert, but I always ask for coconut drops ($1.25), little spicy patties flavored with coconut and ginger that are the Caribbean equivalent of pralines.</p>
        <p>One more thing I like about the Feeding Tree is the name. Like a salt lick, the notion of a feeding tree evokes images of nature and community, a gathering place that meets both physical and social needs. It's about as pastoral as you can get in the South Bronx.</p>
        <p>Feeding Tree  892 Gerard Avenue near 161st Street, the Bronx, (718) 293-5025.</p>
