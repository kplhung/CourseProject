        <p>The Immigration and Naturalization Service yesterday abruptly backed off an effort to deport a 16-year-old Bronx high school student to Trinidad after an apparent mix-up involving his family's residency papers.</p>
        <p>The student, Ricky Ramoutar, who moved to the United States at age 3 with his family, received a terse I.N.S. notice at his Bronx home in April ordering him to appear before an immigration judge. If he failed to show up, the notice warned, he could be arrested and jailed.</p>
        <p>The teenager had come to the agency's attention after playing on an American junior chess team at the World Youth Games in Moscow in 1998. The trip required permission from the I.N.S.</p>
        <p>When he received the notice, Ricky Ramoutar said in an interview, ''I was crushed.''</p>
        <p>At that time, his family's application with the I.N.S. for permanent residency was pending, but the paperwork had been stalled for more than two years. Before Ricky received the notice, family members had assumed that the application was proceeding, albeit slowly.</p>
        <p>''When I went in for the appointment, they told me they would write me,'' said Ricky's father, Barminth Ramoutar. ''They never told me there was any problem.''</p>
        <p>Robert Murtha, the boy's lawyer, said in an interview that after the Ramoutar family came to the United States, the parents split up. Mr. Ramoutar, a welder, married an American citizen. In 1997, based on that marriage, Mr. Ramoutar applied for permanent residency status, seeking what is known as a green card for himself and his two sons.</p>
        <p>When Ricky traveled to Moscow with the chess team from Middle School 118 in the Bronx, he received written permission from immigration officers. But that also brought the young man under scrutiny. In April, they sent the ''notice of removal'' to his apartment. Oddly enough, it applied only to Ricky, not his father or brother.</p>
        <p>''What they said was, 'Show us a reason he should not be kicked out, ''' said Mr. Murtha, an immigration lawyer. ''The reason he got stuck in court was the trip to Russia.''</p>
        <p>The Ramoutars appeared for two interviews with I.N.S. officials, and after that heard nothing about their application. Green-card reviews typically take about 15 months to process, Mr. Murtha said. He said the Ramoutars' application appeared to have fallen through the cracks.</p>
        <p>''I.N.S. is understaffed and overworked, and things do go wrong,'' the lawyer said. ''They are doing their best.''</p>
        <p>After he received the immigration notice, Ricky called Marley Kaplan, the executive director of Chess-in-the-Schools, a New York City program that captured his interest. Ms. Kaplan said she was shocked that immigration officials had wanted to deport him.</p>
        <p>''This is a terrible thing that is happening to a great kid,'' she said. ''He goes off to represent the United States as a champion, and this is what happens to him.''</p>
        <p>The young man had been on the Middle School 118 team that won the national championship in Arizona two years ago, and he still has the trophy. The victory was a great source of pride for the school and the neighborhood, Ms. Kaplan said, and the team's subsequent appearance at the tournament in Moscow was ''a real triumph.'' She has also sponsored Ricky at the Roman Catholic high school he attends now.</p>
        <p>After hearing about Ricky's plight, Ms. Kaplan swung into action, calling Senator Charles E. Schumer's office and the news media. When the Ramoutars appeared in immigration court in Manhattan yesterday morning, the tiny courtroom was crowded with reporters and family friends.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murtha conferred with the I.N.S. lawyer, and the judge adjourned the case until immigration officials could check on the status of the Ramoutars' green-card application. By late afternoon, the agency had changed its position.</p>
        <p>''We have been looking into the specifics of the case,'' Mark Thorne, a spokesman for the immigration service, said in an interview. ''We have asked the immigration court to terminate these proceedings.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murtha said the case was not over because the Ramoutars' application for permanent residency was rejected. He said that according to records that he reviewed with the agency's lawyer yesterday, the application was denied on Aug. 16 because the Ramoutars did not appear for another meeting with immigration officials.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Murtha, who did not represent the Ramoutars on the application matter, said Mr. Ramoutar never received notice of a meeting or of the denial of the green card. He said he hoped that the I.N.S. would cancel the denial and reopen the review.</p>
        <p>''Somebody has got to get on this case and make a motion to get the thing rescheduled,'' he said. ''They have got to get this case back on track.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thorne said he could not comment on whether the immigration service would reconsider the application.</p>
