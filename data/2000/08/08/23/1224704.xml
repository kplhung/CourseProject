        <p>The Firestone tires that have been failing on Ford Explorers have fairly low weight-carrying capability for a vehicle of the Explorer's size, particularly at the low inflation pressure recommended by Ford Motor, publicly available technical specifications for the tires and the Explorers show.</p>
        <p>Officials at Bridgestone/Firestone have said several times over the last two weeks that the recalled 15-inch tires are losing their treads at high speeds partly because drivers are overloading their vehicles. But this can be easy to do in an Explorer: its recommended maximum payload for passengers and cargo is 750 to 1,310 pounds, depending on the model. Four people, plus luggage, can exceed the lower end of that range, particularly if they use the roof rack and the rear cargo area.</p>
        <p>The Explorer is at least as heavy as any of its main rivals in the midsize sport utility market, and has been several hundred pounds heavier in some model years, notably 1996, the vintage that has produced the most crash claims. Yet Ford's rivals typically use either larger tires or recommend higher tire pressures.</p>
        <p>Increasing a tire's size or its pressure allows it to carry more weight safely, provided that the maximum pressure recommended by the tire maker is not exceeded.</p>
        <p>The Chevrolet Blazer, for example, uses the same size tires as the Explorer. But General Motors recommends that the tires on all its midsize sport utilities be inflated to 35 pounds per square inch, compared with just 26 for the Explorer.</p>
        <p>As a result, the combined weight-carrying ability of the Blazer tires is 1,100 pounds greater than the Explorer tires. The recommended maximum payload for a Blazer is 930 to 1,330 pounds, which four adults and their luggage are less likely to exceed.</p>
        <p>The Honda Passport, Nissan Pathfinder and Mitsubishi Montero Sport have the same recommended tire pressure as the Explorer. But the Passport and the Pathfinder use larger tires, with 16-inch diameters, allowing them to carry more weight. The Montero Sport has 15-inch tires that are slightly smaller than those of the Explorer, because they are slightly narrower, but Mitsubishi recommends that customers raise the rear tires' pressure before carrying heavy loads -- a recommendation that Ford has not made for the Explorer.</p>
        <p>Ford has chosen larger tires with higher pressures for its next generation of Explorers, which will go on sale in January. The new tires, chosen several years ago, will be able to carry considerably more weight than the current ones, and will give the new Explorer a recommended payload of 1,100 to 1,500 pounds.</p>
        <p>Ford officials defend their choice of the recalled tires, saying they meet tire industry guidelines for carrying weight. Ford also questions Bridgestone/Firestone's assertion that overloading has contributed to tire failures in the United States, although the automaker acknowledges that tires did fail on Explorers overseas that became overloaded when owners installed third rows of seats and used the vehicles as shuttle buses.</p>
        <p>Ford also contends that with the Explorer or any other truck, it is the responsibility of owners to check weight labels posted on the inside of the doors and then limit the weight put inside, with particular attention to not putting too much weight at the back of the vehicle. ''It provides you on the label the gross vehicle weight rating -- you can't load it so that you exceed 3,000 pounds on the rear axle either,'' said Lee Carr, a vehicle dynamics engineering consultant on the Explorer and former Ford engineer to whom Ford referred questions on the Explorer tires.</p>
        <p>But safety experts have long questioned how many sport utility customers think of their vehicles as trucks, much less check the weight ratings on the label. Mr. Carr acknowledged that people who switched to Explorers from cars might not be accustomed to checking weight ratings.</p>
        <p>Jon Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said the best evidence for the adequacy of the current tire size and pressure lay in the performance of Goodyear tires that were installed on nearly half the Explorers built in the 1995, 1996 and 1997 model years. Goodyear has not had any reports of problems with these tires, said Bill Hopkins, Goodyear's vice president for global product marketing and technical planning. Mr. Harmon said Ford had received just one report of a tread separation involving a Goodyear tire on an Explorer, but the incident did not result in any injuries.</p>
        <p>Ford officials have been consistent in pointing to quality problems in the Firestone tires, while contending that their design decisions did not cause the failures. Reluctant to antagonize their biggest customer, Firestone officials have said little to question this.</p>
        <p>But John Lampe, an executive vice president of Bridgestone/Firestone, said this evening that concerns about the tires' ability to carry the Explorer's weight safely had been one reason for the tire maker's recommendation two weeks ago that Explorer owners begin inflating their tires to 30 pounds per square inch. Ford has since said that a range of 26 to 30 pounds is acceptable.</p>
        <p>Ford's decision on Monday to temporarily close two Ranger pickup factories and an Explorer factory, to make more replacement tires available for Explorers, reflected the fact that the Ranger and the Explorer still use the same tires.</p>
        <p>The Explorer was introduced as a variation of the Ranger in late 1990, and was an immediate best seller. Over the years, the Explorer has grown bigger and heavier, because many people choose practically every option, including four-wheel drive even if they plan no off-road driving. Yet most Explorers still share the tires of a small pickup that weighs half a ton less.</p>
        <p>A decade ago, Ford executives expected only a few customers to choose four-wheel drive, and were taken by surprise that most drivers want the option, which adds 220 pounds to the vehicle's weight. Ford makes the key components for the four-wheel-drive systems at a factory in Bordeaux, France, that has been so backlogged that the automaker has maintained a charter fleet of jets for years just to ferry them to its Explorer assembly plants in Louisville, Ky., and St. Louis.</p>
        <p>''It's a nice problem to have,'' said Steve Von Foerster, the chief program engineer for the Explorer. ''People want it so bad that you have to rent your own fleet of 747's.'' With a profitable model, airlifting heavy auto parts is cheaper than shutting down the assembly plant, but an automaker does it only as a last resort, after greatly underestimating demand for an option.</p>
        <p>Vehicles need tires that can support considerably more than their own weight plus the payload because they lean on the tires on one side when going around curves, and because the weight of cargo and passengers is seldom evenly distributed.</p>
        <p>A typical Ford Explorer weighs 4,000 to 4,400 pounds. Four 15-inch tires of the type and inflation pressure now being recalled can support a total of 7,012 pounds at a pressure of 26 pounds per square inch, according to the tire industry's Tire and Rim Association guidelines. At a pressure of 30 pounds per square inch, which Firestone now recommends, the tires can support a total of 7,525 pounds.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the similarly sized Chevrolet Blazer weighs roughly 4,000 pounds or a little less. It has the same size tires but, because of a higher inflation pressure, the tires can support a total of 8,112 pounds.</p>
