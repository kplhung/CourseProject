        <p>The Georgia Supreme Court yesterday stayed the execution of a man who was scheduled to be put to death in the electric chair on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The man, Alexander Williams, has been on death row since 1986, when he was convicted of the rape and murder of 16-year-old Aleta Bunch, whom he had seized while she was shopping at a mall in Augusta, Ga.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams was 17 when he committed the crime, and recently several national and international groups, including the European Union, have called on Georgia officials to spare Mr. Williams because of his age at the time of the crime. Mr. Williams is also mentally ill and takes antipsychotic drugs.</p>
        <p>''We are ecstatic, of course,'' Mark Olive, Mr. Williams's appellate lawyer, said of the decision, ''but in a sense this stay is just the beginning of the battle. Now we have to convince the court to grant relief, not just a reprieve.''</p>
        <p>The victim's mother, Carolyn Bunch, expressed distress at the court's decision.</p>
        <p>''They're just torturing me longer,'' Ms. Bunch said in a telephone interview. ''I want to see an end to it. I want to see him put to death.''</p>
        <p>The court gave no reasons for granting the stay, which is for an indefinite period, until it has ruled on the merits of the claims made by Mr. Williams's lawyer in an appeal filed a few hours before the ruling.</p>
        <p>There has not been an execution in Georgia since 1998, and the Georgia Supreme Court has under consideration the question of whether the use of the electric chair is cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
        <p>In their appeal, lawyers for Mr. Williams make two arguments that will have a bearing on the cases of the 80 youthful offenders who are on death row in 16 states. (Texas has the most, with 26, followed by Alabama with 14.) One is that the execution of an individual who was under 18 at the time of the crime is cruel and unusual punishment; the second is that executing youthful offenders is a violation of an international human rights treaty that the United States has signed.</p>
        <p>To win on this first point, the lawyers will try to show that a consensus has developed against the execution of youthful offenders.</p>
        <p>Last year the Florida Supreme Court held that executing an individual who was under 17 at the time of his crime violated the cruel or unusual punishment clause of that state's constitution. It noted that a youthful offender had not been executed in Florida in 25 years.</p>
        <p>In urging the Georgia court to reach a similar conclusion, Mr. Williams's lawyers argued that it is ''unusual'' punishment in Georgia because since 1983, just three juveniles have been sentenced to death.</p>
        <p>The United States Supreme Court, in ruling in 1989 that executing 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds did not violate the cruel and unusual proscription of the Eighth Amendment, said a national consensus against such executions had not developed. At the time, the court noted, of the 37 states that permitted capital punishment, just 12 prohibited imposing it on individuals who were under 18 when they committed the crime. Four more states have done so since the court's ruling.</p>
        <p>Turning to international law, lawyers for Mr. Williams argued that states are bound by the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which bans the execution of anyone who was under the age of 18 at the time of the crime.</p>
        <p>The United States Senate voted to ratify this treaty in 1992, but it did so with a reservation: the United States retains the right to impose capital punishment on anyone, except a pregnant woman, including specifically a person who was under 18 at the time of the crime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams's lawyers argue that this reservation is invalid.</p>
        <p>Last year, these arguments reached the Supreme Court in the case of a young Nevada man, Michael Domingues, who was 16 when he committed a double murder. The Clinton administration, in a friend-of-the-court brief, argued that the United States was not bound by the treaty, but the court did not take up the case.</p>
