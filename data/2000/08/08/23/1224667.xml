        <p>A Hard-Nosed Look at Educational 'Reforms'</p>
        <p>Do not look for new educational gimmicks in DIANE RAVITCH'S book ''Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms,'' which is to be published next week by Simon &amp; Schuster. Good teaching is not new, she contends, and new teaching is not necessarily good.</p>
        <p>Much of what passes for school reform, Dr. Ravitch, the educational historian, said in a telephone interview, has been a search for easy solutions, ''the innovative way rather than the effective way.'' Her book chronicles what she depicts as the generally dismal war practiced by educational theorists in the 20th century against high academic standards. She also takes on what she sees as the dumbing down of subject matter and the segregation of children into different tracks in large, impersonal high schools.</p>

        <p>A Hard-Nosed Look at Educational 'Reforms'</p>
        <p>Do not look for new educational gimmicks in DIANE RAVITCH'S book ''Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms,'' which is to be published next week by Simon &amp; Schuster. Good teaching is not new, she contends, and new teaching is not necessarily good.</p>
        <p>Much of what passes for school reform, Dr. Ravitch, the educational historian, said in a telephone interview, has been a search for easy solutions, ''the innovative way rather than the effective way.'' Her book chronicles what she depicts as the generally dismal war practiced by educational theorists in the 20th century against high academic standards. She also takes on what she sees as the dumbing down of subject matter and the segregation of children into different tracks in large, impersonal high schools.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ravitch, a former assistant United States secretary of education, writes that some of the greatest harm to poor and minority children was done in the name of ''progressive'' or ''child centered'' education, whose proponents dismissed all critics as ''far right.''</p>
        <p>''If there is a lesson to be learned from the river of ink that was spilled in the educational disputes of the 20th century,'' her book concludes, ''it is that anything in education that is labeled a 'movement' should be avoided like the plague. What American education most needs is not more nostrums and enthusiasms but more attention to fundamental, time-tested truths.''</p>
        <p>Reduction Plan for Livingston Street</p>
        <p>With summer school out of the way, Schools Chancellor HAROLD O. LEVY is turning his attention to ways to trim the fat from the hulking Board of Education headquarters at 110 Livingston Street in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Last week, his staff sent out a memorandum to department heads seeking suggestions on ways to cut 5 percent to 9 percent from their budgets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy, who is on vacation until next week, was supposed to complete a full-scale review of the board's administrative buildings and staff in June. But in July, he said he needed more time to examine the roles of the 32 district superintendents and their staffs.</p>
        <p>Fordham Appoints a Vice President</p>
        <p>JOHN C. HOLLWITZ, Fordham University's new vice president for academic affairs, knows what it feels like to be a student. He earned two master's degrees (one from Northwestern University and the other from Creighton University, in Omaha) and two doctorates (one in speech from Northwestern and the other in industrial and organizational psychology from the University of Nebraska). Before moving to Fordham, he was dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Loyola College in Baltimore. At Fordham, he replaces ROBERT W. CARRUBBA, who is returning to full-time teaching and research.</p>
        <p>New Leader for Metropolitan Montessori</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Montessori School, on the West Side, has named MARY MOORE GAINES as its new head of school. The previous head, RAMANI DE ALWIS, is moving on to a new career in business. Ms. Gaines, 42 , who has served as associate head for six years, was raised in Europe, graduated from Princeton and received her master's in social work from Columbia University. She is the mother of a recent Metropolitan graduate.</p>
        <p>Finding a Spot for a Specialty School</p>
        <p>The Board of Education and Queens College are again considering where on the college campus to locate a new elementary and middle school specializing in science and scheduled to open in the fall of 2003. Plans for the proposed Queens College School for Math, Science and Technology, which is expected to house 687 students in kindergarten through eighth grade, were unveiled in June, but they immediately drew dissent from neighbors worried about traffic congestion and parking problems near the site, on the northeast portion of the campus. PAM McDONNELL, a Board of Education spokeswoman, said board and college officials were considering other sites.</p>
