        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The wrongful imprisonment of Kerry Sanders, a man with a history of mental health problems, has implications beyond his tragic personal loss of freedom and dignity and the obvious folly of the criminal justice system (editorial, Aug. 20). It is a statement about how our country treats many of its most vulnerable citizens: the seriously mentally ill.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The wrongful imprisonment of Kerry Sanders, a man with a history of mental health problems, has implications beyond his tragic personal loss of freedom and dignity and the obvious folly of the criminal justice system (editorial, Aug. 20). It is a statement about how our country treats many of its most vulnerable citizens: the seriously mentally ill.</p>
        <p>More than 265,000 of the country's mentally ill are now in prison, while only 70,000 receive hospital-based care in public facilities. The correctional system has become the biggest psychiatric hospital in the world.</p>
        <p>People who suffer from mental illness deserve the community-based treatment they were promised, as well as clean, modern hospitals, when needed. The misfortune of Kerry Sanders should serve notice on the public mental health and criminal justice systems.</p>
        <p>ROBERT N. DAVISON  Executive Director, Mental Health  Association of Essex County  Montclair, N.J., Aug. 20, 2000</p>
