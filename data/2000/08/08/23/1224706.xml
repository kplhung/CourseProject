      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Fenced In, Sure, But Not Airtight</p>
        <p>ARLENE HARRISON was dispensing information and one-liners yesterday.</p>
        <p>The information was that in the last week, four dead crows had been found in Gramercy Park, the fenced-in oasis that begins where Lexington Avenue ends. The one found yesterday was turned over to the Health Department to be tested for signs of West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>The one-liners included this one: ''These crows didn't need any keys.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Harrison is the president of the Gramercy Park Block Association, whose 2,000 members live in the 38 buildings surrounding the two-acre parcel with its meandering gravel paths and wrought-iron fence.</p>
        <p>''It's easy to say it's not going to happen here, but if you flaunt it and don't do anything, that's not smart,'' she said. ''A crow is not a popular bird in this area, though they have been known to nest here.''</p>
        <p>My Son the . . .</p>
        <p>So what did KARESSE GRENIER think when she found out that her 23-year-old son, ADRIAN, was playing a ''drug-crazed, demented terrorist'' in JOHN WATERS'S comedy ''Cecil B. DeMented''?</p>
        <p>''I'm convinced he's a good actor because he isn't a druggie,'' said Ms. Grenier, a real estate broker with the Corcoran Group in Manhattan. ''I was very concerned: how did he research this part. He says, 'You know, I have my methods.' One scene he's smoking pot, one scene he's doing cocaine, one scene he's drinking cough syrup, one scene he's doing LSD. Every scene, a different drug, even the scene where he gets killed. But it could have been a lot worse.''</p>
        <p>Words to Leave By</p>
        <p>It wasn't exactly Jack Paar walking off the ''Tonight'' show. But after 19 minutes of a live debate on New York 1, the all-news cable channel that is carried on Time Warner cable systems throughout the city, ASSEMBLYMAN ROGER L. GREEN walked out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green's opponent in the Democratic primary, HAKEEM JEFFRIES, had just begun his closing statement on Monday when he said, ''The issue in this race is not age -- yes, the assemblyman is older, I'm younger. It's not religion -- yes, the assemblyman is a practicing Muslim and I grew up in the Cornerstone Baptist Church.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Green said, ''Practicing Muslim? Where'd that come from?'' A moment later, he said, ''I'm absolutely offended,'' adding, ''Are you trying to polarize our community?'' Then he stood up, telling the moderator, DOMINIC CARTER, that he was walking out. But he did not have an exit strategy. As Mr. Jeffries began again, Mr. Carter interrupted, saying, ''It's the other door, Mr. Green.''</p>
        <p>The debate was talked about on WLIB, a radio station with a largely black audience, throughout the day yesterday. Mr. Green, who did not return a call for comment, said on WLIB that he had walked out because Mr. Jeffries was playing ''the religion card.'' Mr. Jeffries said his point was that voters should not judge the candidates on age or religion, but on their positions on issues.</p>
        <p>No Trespassing</p>
        <p>Trespassing charges will not be filed against a limousine driver who took a wrong turn and ended up outside MARTHA STEWART'S home in Seal Harbor, Me.</p>
        <p>The Associated Press quoted the driver, RICHARD ANDERSON, as saying that he was taking a group of women home from a party last week when he mistakenly turned onto a private road that goes by Ms. Stewart's house.</p>
        <p>ALLYN MAGRINO, a spokeswoman for Ms. Stewart, said  Ms. Stewart ''notified the local police, got into her car and went out to investigate.'' Mr. Anderson told The Associated Press that Ms. Stewart boxed in his limousine, saying she was tired of people coming by her home.</p>
        <p>The district attorney said that no charges would be filed, in part because there were no ''no trespassing'' signs on the road.</p>
