        <p>The AltaVista Internet company has scrapped what would have been a breakthrough plan to offer flat-rate Internet service in Britain, asserting that it had run into roadblocks. In contrast to the United States, where AltaVista is based and where flat-fee and no-fee Internet access have encouraged use, Web users in Britain pay by the minute. New regulations forced British Telecommunications to offer Internet service providers like AltaVista wholesale unmetered service, which the companies can resell to consumers at a flat rate. AltaVista had signed up 270,000 subscribers.</p>
