        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission says it will not take action against Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate candidate in New York, after conducting a two-month preliminary investigation into whether he used inside information to make a series of lucrative securities trades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign released a two-sentence letter from the commission yesterday informing him that it had closed its inquiry and that ''no enforcement action has been recommended.'' The commission, which sent the letter on Monday, would not comment further.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Lazio said he was ''pleased that this matter has been quickly settled.''</p>
        <p>In June, the commission opened its inquiry into Mr. Lazio's trading in securities of Quick &amp; Reilly, a brokerage company whose executives are among his biggest contributors. Mr. Lazio spent $2,300 on speculative options trades in the company's stock in 1997, and in less than seven weeks earned a profit of roughly $13,500, or nearly 600 percent.</p>
        <p>It was the first time that Mr. Lazio, who has regularly bought and sold stocks in recent years, engaged in such high-risk trading. Mr. Lazio also made a 53 percent profit, or $6,900, in Quick &amp; Reilly stock in 1997 and 1998. Over all, he was far more successful in Quick &amp; Reilly securities than he was in any other since he became a congressman in 1993.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said in June that he had not obtained inside information from executives of the company. He said he was a modest investor with average returns, and had put money in Quick &amp; Reilly securities because he believed the company was undervalued. Soon after Mr. Lazio's investments, the company's stock soared when word leaked out that Quick &amp; Reilly was putting itself up for sale.</p>
        <p>''I would say I think that it was a good company and one that got batted down, and I thought that was an opportunity,'' Mr. Lazio said at the time. ''I never had a single discussion'' about the stock with Quick &amp; Reilly executives. Executives of Quick &amp; Reilly have given a total of at least $35,000 to Mr. Lazio's campaign since 1995. Two of those donors, Peter Quick and Christopher C. Quick, said they had never discussed the company's stock with Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Besides prompting the S.E.C. inquiry, Mr. Lazio's profits also focused attention on whether a member of Congress with influence over Wall Street -- Mr. Lazio serves on both the House Banking and Commerce Committees -- should be trading in the stocks of financial services companies. He has also bought and sold stock in others with business before his committees, including Goldman Sachs. His aides have said he votes solely on an issue's merits.</p>
        <p>When word of the S.E.C. inquiry was disclosed in June, Mr. Lazio's aides attacked it as politically motivated, noting that the commission was controlled by appointees of President Clinton. The aides pointed out that the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, had called for an inquiry, citing an article about the trades in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the commission, while declining to confirm the inquiry, said then that the agency was independent. And it appears that the commission began its inquiry before Mr. McCall's request.</p>
        <p>The commission generally does not discuss current investigations, but when it closes one without taking action, it customarily sends a short letter to the subject. The letter is not made public, though Mr. Lazio chose to disclose it.</p>
        <p>The commission is not required to finish its preliminary inquiries within a specific time period. Still, it was undoubtedly mindful that if the inquiry dragged on into the fall, it might increasingly affect the Senate race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's trading recalled that of several other politicians whose securities profits have come under scrutiny, including his Democratic opponent in the Senate race, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Senator Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat, and former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican.</p>
        <p>When her husband was attorney general and then governor of Arkansas in the late 1970's, Mrs. Clinton turned a $1,000 investment into nearly $100,000 over 10 months by trading in risky commodities futures. An executive of Tyson Foods, which is regulated by the Arkansas government, assisted her in the trades. Republicans have cited those profits as an example of what they called a pattern of questionable ethical behavior. Democrats had sought to use the S.E.C. inquiry to neutralize any attempt by the Lazio campaign to criticize her over the profits.</p>
        <p>Each candidate tried yesterday to portray the other as bringing down the tone of the race. ''I hope Mrs. Clinton will now join me in a campaign about issues and finally abandon her tactics of personal attacks and innuendo,'' Mr. Lazio said in his statement. ''New Yorkers deserve better than her distortions.'' Karen Dunn, a Clinton campaign spokeswoman, said: ''Hillary has been running a campaign of issues and ideas for over a year. Now that the S.E.C. probe is over, maybe Congressman Lazio will come out of hiding and begin defending his record.''</p>
        <p>Information about the Quick &amp; Reilly trades was gleaned from the financial disclosure forms that Mr. Lazio is required to file with Congress. He has declined to release copies of his trading records and tax returns. Mr. Lazio's aides, who have promised the tax returns for several weeks, say they are unremarkable.</p>
