        <p>Two days after more than 50,000 employees of Verizon Communications ended a 15-day strike in New York and New England, representatives for thousands of their colleagues continued to haggle with the company over details of a contract proposal yesterday, prolonging the walkout in several Eastern states.</p>
        <p>Negotiators for Verizon employees in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and Washington discussed details like limits on mandatory overtime and the definition of certain jobs with officials of the company, which was formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the GTE Corporation.</p>
        <p>One of the main reasons the strike has dragged on in this region is the structure of the union. Most of the employees who returned to work on Monday are in the territory of the former Nynex, which Bell Atlantic acquired in 1997, while the employees in the six-state region stretching from New Jersey to Virginia are in Bell Atlantic's original territory.</p>
        <p>In these states, customer service representatives have greater representation in union locals, and one of the main concerns of these employees heading into the strike was large amounts of mandatory overtime. So while union negotiators from New York and New England were pleased for the most part when Verizon agreed to limit mandatory overtime to eight hours a week, negotiators in these other states have pushed for an even lower requirement.</p>
        <p>''We're simply trying to arrive at the best possible agreement,'' said Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America, the union whose members have not returned to work.</p>
        <p>The 14,000 or so members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the other union that was on strike, are mainly in New England, while the other bargaining unit for about 40,000 members of the communications workers' union is rooted mainly in New York and New England. The union put the number of remaining strikers at about 40,000, while Verizon says the number is closer to 35,000.</p>
        <p>Another reason for the strike's protracted conclusion is the priorities set by regional union leaders, like the definition of cable splicers' jobs in Pennsylvania, which is where Vincent Maisano, the lead negotiator for the remaining unit, is from. Mr. Maisano has apparently made this issue and other details of the proposed contract sticking points, people close to the talks said. Mr. Maisano could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>In a show of support for Mr. Maisano and his fellow negotiators, the union's national office in Washington asked union members in New York to respect the picket lines formed by striking employees sent there to put pressure on Verizon. But it appeared that most union members in the region had returned to work as picket lines thinned in New York, New Jersey and other states.</p>
        <p>As it tried to resolve the remaining issues in the strike, Verizon, the nation's largest local and mobile telephone company, also worked to decrease orders for repairs and new service that swelled by more than a third during the strike. The company had about 73,000 outstanding repairs and 200,000 orders for new service to fill as of yesterday, said Eric Rabe, Verizon's spokesman.</p>
