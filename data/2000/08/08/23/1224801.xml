        <p>Kenyon Martin, the Nets' first-round draft pick, passed his physical yesterday, which was merely an exercise in caution by a franchise riddled by injuries. But Martin's right leg has completely healed since being broken in March, and with the formality out of the way, he has signed his contract.</p>
        <p>When the signing becomes official today, Martin will make the rookie maximum, $11,405,760 for three years. The Nets have a team option for the fourth year, in which his salary could increase 26 percent, and Martin has the first right of refusal for the fifth year. The Nets have the right to match any offer at a 30 percent increase over his fourth-year salary.</p>
