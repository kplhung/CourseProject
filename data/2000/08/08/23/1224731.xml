        <p>This is a new 30-second commercial, called ''Won't See,'' that the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign began broadcasting statewide last night.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- The Clinton Team</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- This is a hard-hitting advertisement from Mrs. Clinton's campaign, intended to mock an advertisement Mr. Lazio released last week heralding his record in Congress on housing and education issues. This one, like Mr. Lazio's, opens with white text against a black screen, with the printed words echoing what the announcer is proclaiming, to the same patriotic music Mr. Lazio employed. It shifts to a fuzzy, vaguely ominous picture of Mr. Lazio with Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker -- the quality is akin to that of a bank camera that has captured a bank robbery in progress. It moves to a photograph of Mr. Lazio standing alone, as the announcer, with a sharp, snide tone, lists votes Mr. Lazio cast against, among other things, federal financing for teachers.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''The end to nursing home standards. The largest education cuts in history. The slashing of Medicare by $270 billion. Who voted for all this? Rick Lazio. Four years as Newt Gingrich's deputy whip. You won't see that in his ads. And you won't see his recent votes against investing in 100,000 new teachers and against guaranteed prescription drug coverage under Medicare. With Rick Lazio, the more you know, the more you wonder.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The nursing home standards refers to 1995 legislation, sought by some governors, to eliminate federal control over nursing homes, handing control to the state. Mr. Lazio voted with House Republicans for the largest tax cuts in education spending imposed in the nation's history, though Mr. Lazio countered yesterday by saying that President Clinton had proposed even larger ones. The Medicare cut is a question of what the definition of the word ''cut'' is: Democrats call it a flat-out cut, while Republicans, more accurately, call it a cut in the rate of growth in Medicare spending. Mr. Lazio voted against a Democratic bill to provide financing for 100,000 more teachers, but voted for a Republican bill that did pretty much the same thing. He voted against a Democratic bill that would have provided prescription drug coverage under Medicare, though he supported a far more limited Republican bill.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- With this ad, Mrs. Clinton officially brings Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, back into her campaign arsenal. She had initially invoked him when Mr. Lazio got in the race, and then stopped trying to associate the two Congressional Republicans after her aides determined that it was showing no sign of traction. After two months of using various other attacks on Mr. Lazio, Mrs. Clinton has come back to using Mr. Gingrich as a way of portraying Mr. Lazio as conservative. The advertisement is intended to turn Mr. Lazio's voting record, which he has presented as a way of reminding voters of Mrs. Clinton's lack of a voting record, against him, on issues that polls have shown could be decisive in the campaign ahead.</p>
