        <p>YankeeNets completed its $176 million purchase of the Devils yesterday, nine days before a deal-breaking deadline.</p>
        <p>The original $175 million sale price was augmented by a $1 million bonus for winning the Stanley Cup.</p>
        <p>Lou Lamoriello will remain general manager and president.</p>
        <p>After 18 years under the ownership of John McMullen and his limited partner, John Whitehead, the Devils will now be owned by YankeeNets, which will run the team as the general partner, Puck Holdings, and with six new limited partners.</p>
        <p>Puck Holdings was formed by Lewis Katz and Raymond Chambers, two principal investors in YankeeNets, who solicited the new investment, which was all cash, said Harvey Schiller, the chairman of YankeeNets.</p>
        <p>The sale was supposed to close on July 12 but was slowed by the National Hockey League's checks on YankeeNets' investors and the new limited partners.</p>
        <p>Had YankeeNets not closed the deal by Aug. 31, the deal would have collapsed and the company would have owed McMullen a $30 million breakup fee. McMullen will keep a limited stake in exchange for deferring part of the sale price.</p>
        <p>Buying the Devils is crucial to a YankeeNets plan to build an arena in downtown Newark and to the year-round strength of a cable network that would eventually carry Yankees, Nets and Devils games.</p>
        <p>Schiller said talks are continuing to settle a lawsuit filed by the MSG Network to block YankeeNets from forming a cable TV network with the International Management Group. YankeeNets is talking to Cablevision, MSG's parent company, about investing in the network.</p>
