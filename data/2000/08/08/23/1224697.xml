        <p>Authors, agents and publishers often work hard to promote their books in the hopes of winning a spot on the New York Times best-seller list. Alan Nevins, a prominent literary agent with Michael Ovitz's Artists Management Group in Los Angeles, took promotion a step further last week by placing orders for at least 18,000 copies of his client's new book at a handful of small bookstores that report sales to The Times's list keepers.</p>
        <p>''This order of books should be reported the week ending August 18th to The New York Times in the business category, as an off-site author book signing,'' Mr. Nevins wrote in a fax to one bookstore, putting the date in bold for emphasis.</p>

        <p>Authors, agents and publishers often work hard to promote their books in the hopes of winning a spot on the New York Times best-seller list. Alan Nevins, a prominent literary agent with Michael Ovitz's Artists Management Group in Los Angeles, took promotion a step further last week by placing orders for at least 18,000 copies of his client's new book at a handful of small bookstores that report sales to The Times's list keepers.</p>
        <p>''This order of books should be reported the week ending August 18th to The New York Times in the business category, as an off-site author book signing,'' Mr. Nevins wrote in a fax to one bookstore, putting the date in bold for emphasis.</p>
        <p>Times editors involved with the best-seller list said Mr. Nevins's effort would not influence their compilation, because unusually large bulk orders are deemed suspect and are typically not counted. But Mr. Nevins's activities seem likely to reinforce concerns among publishers and bookstores about efforts to influence the various best-seller lists artificially.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Nevins said manipulating the best-seller list was not his intention when he sent orders worth more than $75,000 to four Los Angeles bookstores for thousands of copies of the new book, ''Hope From My Heart: 10 Lessons for Life,'' written by his client Rich DeVos, the 74-year-old co-founder of the marketing giant Amway.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nevins said he arranged the sales on behalf of companies that distribute Amway products so they could resell the books at a markup during their fall sales conferences. Amway sells a variety of items like cosmetics and soap through a pyramid-style network of salespeople. He said he arranged special discounts from the publisher because of the size of the orders, but Mr. Nevins declined to explain why he opted against the even cheaper alternatives of buying through a book distributor or directly from the publisher.</p>
        <p>But Ron Land, a sales executive at the book's publisher, Thomas Nelson Publishers, said that getting the book on the best-seller list was indeed the motive for arranging the sales at bookstores.</p>
        <p>''The purpose of directing those sales through the stores was to get the book a presence in the marketplace and get it on the list, and give our marketing a jump-start,'' Mr. Land said. He said he believed that it was ''very common'' for business book authors to arrange bulk purchases either from seminars they lead or companies they run, directing the sales through stores to get on the lists.</p>
        <p>''Most people who are successful in the business book area have a large machine behind them, like Amway; that is just the way things are done nowadays,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Owners of the stores involved say Mr. Nevins made his intentions clear to them as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nevins's firm, Artists Management, issued a statement yesterday: ''We are concerned about the issues that have been raised. As a matter of corporate policy, we don't condone or support any activities that could potentially jeopardize the integrity of any best-seller list. We have asked our outside counsel to conduct a thorough fact-finding review of the matter and will take whatever action is appropriate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nevins's effort began last week with calls to the bookstores with an unusual proposition involving Mr. DeVos's new book.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nevins offered to pay the stores in advance to order thousands of books at deep discounts from the publisher, for direct shipment elsewhere. ''Many thanks for your help in this matter,'' he wrote in his fax.  ''More to come!''</p>
        <p>Some bookstores played along.</p>
        <p>''We said fine,'' said Mahri Kerley, owner of Chaucer's Bookstore in Santa Barbara, Calif. Mr. Nevins sent her a check for $25,200, instructing her to pay $22,680 to Thomas Nelson Publishers for 6,000 copies of the book. At $3.78 cents a copy, that was a considerable discount from the normal price to bookstores of about $6.50 a copy. And the arrangement left Ms. Kerley $2,520 in profit without the risk of stocking a single book.</p>
        <p>''It was amazing,'' she said. ''Who am I to turn it down?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kerley said she happily reported the sales to The Times, knowing that the best-seller list compilers would disregard the order as an anomaly. But she did not tell that to Mr. Nevins. ''I figured that he had to have that much brains,'' she said.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Nevins's request, Dutton's Brentwood Bookstore, in Brentwood, Calif., bought and reported sales of about 8,000 books. After calling Dutton's for advice on Mr. Nevins's proposal, Chevalier's Books in Los Angeles also bought and reported sales of 4,000 copies.</p>
        <p>One bookstore balked at Mr. Nevins's request. ''I put my finger to my nose because it stunk,'' said Karen Watkins of Vroman's Bookstore, in Pasadena, Calif., who received a fax from Mr. Nevins outlining the same terms.</p>
        <p>She said she immediately reported to The Times and to the American Booksellers Association that a scheme was afoot to manipulate the best-seller list. ''I was stunned that he put something like this in writing,'' Ms. Watkins said. No other independents or any of the chains reported any orders at all for the DeVos book.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nevins is not the first to try to influence The Times's best-seller list. In 1995, Business Week reported that Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema arranged large purchases of their own book, ''The Discipline of Market Leaders.'' The magazine said a consulting company associated with the authors paid $250,000 to buy 10,000 copies of their book and funneled 30,000 to 40,000 additional purchases through corporate clients, all made at stores. Times editors said the efforts might have influenced the book's rank on the list, but not its appearance there.</p>
        <p>The Times does not disclose its survey methodology, a secrecy that some critics say fuels speculation about potential manipulations.</p>
        <p>''People in the business are suspicious because The Times's formula is guarded like some kind of secret sauce,'' said Oren Teicher, chief operating officer of the American Booksellers Association, a trade group representing independent bookstores. The association compiles a best-seller list of its own each week, based on sales reports from 350 stores whose participation is publicly disclosed.</p>
        <p>Michael Kagay, The Times's surveys editor, whose department compiles the list, said the paper kept its methods secret to make outwitting its system more difficult.</p>
        <p>Charles McGrath, editor of The Times Book Review, said that although manipulating the list was not impossible, it would be expensive and difficult.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kagay said the paper relied on reports from big chains as well as a constantly changing list of hundreds of independent stores. The paper does not disclose the stores' names, although people in the industry contend that they are widely known. Mr. Nevins managed to call at least four stores that report to The Times.</p>
        <p>After receiving sales reports from stores, the Times editors look for unusual sales patterns. In many cases, the editors remove or mark down unusual sales, Mr. Kagay said. When they decide that including the bulk sales is appropriate -- sales to a local book club, for example -- the editors also note on the weekly published list which books received bulk orders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Land of Thomas Nelson, a religious publisher based in Nashville, said it was partly the frequency of such special notes that led him to believe it was common practice for a business author to arrange bulk orders of his own book.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kagay said the extremely improbable sales of Mr. DeVos's book -- at a time when no other stores reported any sales, and coming from small stores that report only a few hundred sales of even a Harry Potter book -- certainly would have excluded the DeVos book from The Times's list.</p>
