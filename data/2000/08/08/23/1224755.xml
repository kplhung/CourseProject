        <p>THE DEBATES</p>
        <p>LET'S TALK  In a telephone call on Monday, the chairmen of the Bush and Gore campaigns began tentative negotiations on debates. Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Al Gore, said the vice president's chairman, William M. Daley, former commerce secretary, had spoken with Donald L. Evans, an oil entrepreneur and friend of Gov. George W. Bush. Mr. Bush has said he is willing to debate Mr. Gore three times, but has not accepted the dates, sites or formats of the October events proposed by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. Mr. Gore's aides have said he will accept those debate invitations as well as others. Mr. Daley has asked Alexis M. Herman, the labor secretary, and James A. Johnson, the chairman of Fannie Mae, to help him in negotiations with the Bush campaign, Mr. Lehane said.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>BUSH BLOOPERS  Sooner or later, it happens to just about every candidate, especially after long hours on the campaign trail. And Monday night, during a stop in Des Moines, it happened to George W. Bush. Just about every other sentence he uttered in a 15-minute speech at a fund-raiser seemed to have a blooper in it. His first slip of the lip came when said, ''When we carry Iowa in November, it'll mean the end of four years of Clinton-Gore.'' (He meant eight years.) Next, outlining his trade policy, he promised, ''I will work to end terrors,'' only to catch himself and make it ''tariffs and barriers.'' His policy on national security: ''We cannot let terrorists and rogue nations hold this nation hostile or hold our allies hostile.'' But Mr. Bush's audience seemed not to mind. He was cheered again and again.</p>

        <p>THE PRIMARIES</p>
        <p>HOTLY CONTESTED SEAT  Republicans in Oklahoma nominated the chosen successor to a retiring Republican House member today, while Democrats sent two candidates to a runoff in primaries for the seat, which has drawn the attention of both parties in the fight to control the House. Each hopes to win the seat held since 1994 by Representative Tom Coburn, a Republican, who kept a campaign promise to retire after three terms.</p>
        <p>With 94 percent of the precincts reporting in the district, where Republicans are outnumbered 5 to 2, Mr. Coburn's chosen successor, Andy Ewing, a car dealer, won with 60 percent. Among Democrats, Brad Carson, a law professor, took 45 percent of the vote, while State Representative Bill Settle took 40 percent.</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>THE $12.6 MILLION QUESTION  Asked to referee a Reform Party fight, officials of the Federal Election Commission are preparing to decide, reluctantly, who should get $12.6 million in federal presidential campaign funds, Patrick J. Buchanan, top, or John Hagelin, bottom. Both candidates claimed the Reform mantle at a raucous convention this month that ended with the party dividing into two factions that nominated separate candidates: Mr. Buchanan to represent the conservatives who have recently flooded into the party, and Mr. Hagelin to represent believers in the kind of governmental reforms that  Ross Perot called for when he founded it.</p>
        <p>By the end of this week, both men are expected to have formally applied for the money, and the F.E.C. will rule on each application separately within 10 days of receiving it. It is possible that both candidates will be eligible for the money, Darryl R. Wold, the commission chairman, said yesterday. He added, however, that federal law did not provide any guidance in that regard, and so ''agency attorneys are now analyzing what should be done in that case.'' Whatever the six-member commission eventually rules, both sides say the next stop will probably be in court. In fact, the two factions are already in litigation. Yesterday the chairman of the Buchanan faction, Gerry Moan, sued Mr. Hagelin for claiming to be the party's ''proper'' presidential nominee.</p>
