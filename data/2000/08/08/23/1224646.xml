        <p>THE first ones to arrive in stores were labeled Dinosaur or Dinosaur Egg. Pluot sounds just as strange, but none of those names capture the luscious sweetness and complexity of the new hybrid plum that seems bound to take over the market.</p>
        <p>Pluot, the trademark for a cross between plums and apricots, has the rich, juicy flesh of a plum but more sweetness, thanks to the apricot's naturally higher sugar content. There's none of the pucker that can sabotage the most delicious of plums. Instead, there's an astonishing interplay of flavors and aromas -- vanilla, honey, melon -- almost as in a glass of dessert wine.</p>
        <p>Chefs love Pluots for the glorious color, texture and flavor they bring to tarts and other desserts. Growers love them too -- they think of them as a better plum, sweeter and sturdier. Plums, with their thick skins, have always stood up well on the road, and Pluots are no different, but they ripen beautifully and more consistently than most plums. In the next few years, the industry predicts, they could account for a quarter to a half of the plum supply in the United States.</p>
        <p>The original cross, 50-50 plum and apricot, was called a plumcot and can be traced back more than 100 years to the famous botanist Luther Burbank. Pluots evolved out of that early hybrid, but most are about three-fifths plum and two-fifths apricot.</p>
        <p>The Pluot was developed and named by Zaiger's Genetics, a plant breeder near Modesto, Calif. Leith Zaiger, the company's general manager, said that Zaiger's had been developing Pluots for 35 years but that only in the last year or two had there been enough successful commercial planting to supply the domestic and export markets on a large scale.</p>
        <p>The Pluot has taken off because ''California growers are always interested in growing better fruit,'' said Bob Maxwell, the director of special projects for Kingsburg Apple Sales in Kingsburg, Calif., which packs and distributes its own Pluots and those grown by others.</p>
        <p>The fruit started turning up in produce stands in July and should be available until the end of September. Dinosaur and Dinosaur Egg are brand names established several years ago for Pluots grown by one California grower, Jackson Family Farm.  They bear a tiny sticker showing a brontosaurus, but even without the label the fruit is  easily recognizable. It is a hefty fistful, with pinkish-red skin dappled in gray and deep reddish flesh sometimes fading to ivory. As appealing as the color is, the flavor is better: deliciously sweet and meaty, with the merest hint of tartness.</p>
        <p>Although there are other Pluots available, just as large but in other colors, Dinosaurs appear to be chefs' favorites in New York. Tadashi Ono, at Sono in Midtown, uses them to make a compote to serve with foie gras because, he says, they have a denser, more peachlike texture. Paula Oland, the pastry chef at Balthazar Bakery in SoHo, uses Dinosaur Eggs, often with green Kelsey plums, on a galette with puff pastry and frangipani.</p>
        <p>For now, though, traditional plums dominate the market. Dale Janzen, a field agent with the California Fruit Commission, estimates that a total of 3 million boxes of Pluots, or 87 million pounds, will be sold this year, compared with 17 million boxes (476 million pounds) of plums.</p>
        <p>About 200 varieties of plums are grown in California. Most are in season for just a couple of weeks. But the consumer is rarely aware: most shops tend not to label them except by color, though you may spot names like Simka, Fortune, Friar or Catalina.</p>
        <p>Elephant Hearts are easier to spot. They are fat like Dinosaur Eggs but are actually plums. They're slightly pointy, with brownish skins, bright scarlet flesh and a richly concentrated, jammy flavor.</p>
        <p>In New York, some locally grown plums are making their debut in the Greenmarkets and also in some stores. Shiros are most visible. They are bright golden plums about the size of golf balls. Highly perishable and extremely juicy, they have a taste something like sweet lemonade. Maury Rubin, the owner of City Bakery near Union Square, prefers Shiros for his almond tartlets. ''I'm hooked on local plums,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Plums were first cultivated in China about 2,000 years ago. They are classified as drupe fruits, with a single large stone, like peaches, nectarines and cherries. There are several families of plums, some of which have been crossbred for hundreds of years, so sorting them out is a challenge. To put it simply, most big plums were developed from Japanese plums brought to America in the 1880's by Burbank.</p>
        <p>European plums include prune plums, like the Italian freestone or the French pruneau d'Agen, which are often used in cooking or baking and, as their name indicates, for drying as prunes. In addition, there are small plums like damsons and mirabelles, which are extremely tart and best cooked with ample sugar.</p>
        <p>The skin is no clue to the taste or flesh. Some red plums, like the Simca, are tart and salmon-colored inside, while others, like the big Fortunes, are winey-tasting and golden inside. Black plums seem to vary even more, with flesh that can be reddish to ivory pink and a taste that varies from delicately sugared in the Catalina to tart-sweet in the lush Black Diamond and almost bland in the Friar, a popular late-season plum.</p>
        <p>The heart-shaped and green-skinned Kelsey is distinctive enough that it is usually labeled with its proper name. A prized European green plum, the Greengage, is known in France as the Reine Claude, a venerable variety.</p>
        <p>Because plums and Pluots have jewel-like color and often excellent flavor, there is every reason to use them in the kitchen and not just in the fruit bowl. The pits are sometimes tenacious but are usually small and can be extracted with little waste. And even though plum and Pluot skins are relatively thick, they don't have to be peeled for most recipes.</p>
        <p>Pluots can be used in recipes calling for most plums except the small Italian prune plums or other cooking plums. But to replace Pluots with plums, always choose larger, meatier, sweeter varieties like Black Diamonds, Elephant Hearts, large Kelseys and Fortunes. Plums -- and now Pluots -- are a wonderfully reliable fruit because they are not as prone to bruising like peaches and nectarines. When they are stored in a brown paper bag at room temperature, they ripen well.</p>
        <p>Like tomatoes, plums and Pluots are ready to eat when they yield to light pressure without feeling soft. Then they can be refrigerated for several days. Plums and especially Pluots rarely suffer from the dry mealiness that can affect poorly stored peaches, nectarines and apricots.</p>
        <p>No wonder California growers have started selling prunes with a more appetizing name, dried plums.</p>
        <p>PLUOT CARPACCIO WITH GINGER SAUCE  Time: 45 minutes, plus chilling</p>
        <p>8 red Pluots, ripe but not soft</p>
        <p>1/3 cup sugar  1 1/2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger</p>
        <p>1/4 cup ginger liqueur  6 mint sprigs for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Cut Pluots in half lengthwise, and remove pits. With a mandoline or fine slicing blade on a food processor, use very gentle pressure to slice Pluot halves paper-thin, starting with the flat cut side. Reserve uneven slices, scraps and pieces with a hole from pits.</p>
        <p>2. Arrange perfectly round slices closely overlapping like petals on each of 6 dessert plates. You should have about 25 slices a plate. Refrigerate.</p>
        <p>3. Finely chop remaining pieces; you should have about 1 1/2 cups. Place in small saucepan. Add sugar, ginger and  1/3 cup water. Bring to a simmer, and cook over medium heat about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fruit has nearly dissolved and is like a sauce. Remove from heat, stir in liqueur, transfer to a metal bowl and place bowl in ice water to chill. Refrigerate if not serving right away.</p>
        <p>4. To serve, drizzle about 3 tablespoons of sauce over each plate of sliced Pluots, and garnish with mint.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>PLUM TARTLETS WITH TOASTED ALMOND CREAM  Adapted from City Bakery  Time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>Sweet pastry for 6 4-inch tartlet shells  7 small to medium plums (Shiro, Santa Rosa, sugar), or 3 large plums or Pluots  3 ounces (about 1 cup), slivered almonds</p>
        <p>3/4 cup confectioners' sugar  6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened and cut into 6 pieces  1 large egg yolk.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line pans with pastry, line pastry with foil and baking weights, and bake 10 minutes. Remove foil, and continue baking until golden. Remove from oven and set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Halve and pit small plums, and cut each in about 6 slices  1/2 inch thick. If using large plums, cut 10 to 12 slices from each,  1/2 inch thick, 1 inch wide and 2 inches long. Set aside.</p>
        <p>3. Spread almonds on baking sheet. Toast in oven until golden, about 5 minutes. Let cool, then transfer to food processor or grinder and process until coarsely ground.</p>
        <p>4. Place sugar in bowl of electric mixer or in bowl to use with hand mixer. Add butter, and toss lightly to coat. Beat at medium speed until mixture is creamy and no sugar shows. Add almonds, and beat 30 seconds. Add egg yolk, and beat to blend.</p>
        <p>5. Spread mixture evenly in tartlet shells. Stand 3 plum slices, skin-edge up, in a row down the center of each tartlet. Stand 2 more slices on either side of each row.</p>
        <p>6. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until almond filling is puffed and golden around the edges but soft in center. Plums will brown around the edges. Remove from oven, transfer to wire rack and cool. Filling may sink a bit as tartlets cool.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>PLUM CHUTNEY  Time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>8 large plums or Pluots, preferably a mixture of colors  1 cup chopped sweet onion  Juice and grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
        <p>1/4 cup red wine vinegar  2 tablespoons port  1 cup light brown sugar, packed  1 teaspoon crushed black peppercorns  2 teaspoons ground cardamom</p>
        <p>1/8 teaspoon ground cloves.</p>
        <p>1. Pit and chop plums or Pluots. Place in a heavy saucepan with remaining ingredients, bring to a simmer and cook over medium heat about 20 minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated and mixture is thick.</p>
        <p>2. Transfer to sterilized canning jars with new lids or plastic refrigerator containers. For pantry storage, process sealed canning jars in boiling water bath for 20 minutes. Otherwise, refrigerate or freeze.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 cups.</p>
