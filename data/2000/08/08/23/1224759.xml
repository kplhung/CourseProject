        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Robert A. Mosbacher (Op-Ed, Aug. 18) writes of the sorry state of profits in the oil and gas industry in recent years, and says it is time  for the oil and gas companies to enjoy good returns, as they are now doing. But he doesn't mention that the 100 percent increases in second-quarter profits for some oil companies are burdensome to the average consumer.</p>

        <p>We recently learned that the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Dick Cheney, is to receive $20 million in retirement benefits from Halliburton, an energy services company, and that the current value of all his stocks and options is about $39 million. Is it unreasonable to suppose that if the excessive payments to executives like Mr. Cheney had been reduced to reasonable amounts, this industry's returns would have been far greater?</p>
