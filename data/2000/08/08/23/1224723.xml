        <p>When Allan Houston woke up yesterday morning, his biggest concern was polishing his game for the Sydney Olympics. Houston, the Knicks' All-Star guard, planned to work on his jump shot and ball-handling at Manhattan College.</p>
        <p>But when Houston reached the parking lot of the gymnasium, he found reporters waiting to ask him about the possibility of his being traded. With the Knicks having come within hours of dealing Patrick Ewing to Seattle in a four-team, 13-player move that would have landed them Vin Baker and Glen Rice, the logical question was, is Houston next?</p>
        <p>Even Houston, the Knicks' leading scorer last season, acknowledged that a team featuring him, Latrell Sprewell and Rice was hard to fathom.</p>
        <p>Asked if such a lineup made him wonder, Houston said: ''It does. But a lot of things in life make you scratch your head. And there might be a lot of things that you question. You may question your boss, but I don't question what God has for me, and that's ultimately what it comes down to to me.''</p>
        <p>While Ewing's future is uncertain, Houston's status with the Knicks may also be unsure. It is believed that the Knicks have a strong interest in Rice, a sharpshooting small forward whose long-range ability has earned him three All-Star Game appearances. It is doubtful Rice would be happy as the club's sixth man.</p>
        <p>Though a starter, Rice complained last season about his limited role on the Los Angeles Lakers amid the team's march to the National Basketball Association championship.</p>
        <p>Starting Rice at small forward would mean Sprewell's return to the backcourt, making Houston expendable. If the Knicks acquire Rice, the only logical choices besides trading Houston will be for the Knicks to deal Sprewell or to start both Houston and Sprewell at the guard spots. But Sprewell is the club's most popular and versatile player, and experiments with the big backcourt have been sketchy.</p>
        <p>Houston made it clear that he does not want to leave New York. He also believes that the Knicks do not need to trade Ewing. While some insist that the Knicks must improve to keep pace with the new-look Miami Heat, Houston believes they have enough to win a title as they are.</p>
        <p>''I think if our guys individually make the best out of their situation, work hard in the summer and dedicate themselves to one common goal, we can win a championship,'' Houston said. ''But the bottom line is that the ownership runs a business and they make business decisions. Our job is to go out and produce.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''The bottom line is, can Patrick Ewing, Houston, Sprewell and our group win? Yes, I think we can.''</p>
        <p>But Houston wavered when asked if he hoped Ewing was his teammate next season. ''Yeah, I hope he's back,'' he said before backtracking. ''I'm not going to say I hope he'll be back. I want him to be happy. He deserves to finish his career -- whenever that is -- how he wants to finish it.''</p>
        <p>The former Knicks Anthony Mason, Mark Jackson and Rod Strickland also worked out at Manhattan College yesterday. Like Houston, they all criticized the New York fans and news media for welcoming a trade of Ewing, and Mason even scoffed at the Knicks organization.</p>
        <p>''Patrick is the best thing in New York since sliced bread, and then all of a sudden because he wants a contract like everybody else, he's the worst thing to ever walk,'' Mason said. ''The New York Knicks organization has a tendency of doing that. It's happened to me. It's happened to Riley. And now it's happening to Pat.''</p>
        <p>Mason, who was recently traded to Miami along with Eddie Jones, said the improvement of the Heat, which will soon complete a trade for Brian Grant, has sparked the Knicks to make a major personnel move.</p>
        <p>''I think with this lineup that we have now, it made New York jump and get frantic, and I think they're making a big mistake,'' Mason said.</p>
        <p>Without Ewing, Mason doesn't see the Knicks competing with Miami. ''You play against a team with no center and you might be better without him at times because you can outrun people,'' Mason said. ''But you play against the Twin Towers or play against Shaquille O'Neal without a center like Ewing and you're in trouble.''</p>
