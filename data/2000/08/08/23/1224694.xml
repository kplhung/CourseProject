        <p>Confronting a wave of violence among Protestant paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland, British officials ordered the re-arrest today of one of the province's most notorious Protestant militants, 11 months after he had been freed under the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement.</p>

        <p>Confronting a wave of violence among Protestant paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland, British officials ordered the re-arrest today of one of the province's most notorious Protestant militants, 11 months after he had been freed under the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement.</p>
        <p>The man, Johnny Adair, was seized in a car on the Protestant Shankhill Road in Belfast as British troops returned to the city's streets one day after two men were shot to death in an increasingly violent feud between Protestant ''loyalist'' organizations. Witnesses said Mr. Adair was ordered out of the car and told to lie on the ground before being driven to a prison outside the city.</p>
        <p>British officials depict the fighting between the loyalist paramilitaries as a narcotics-fueled turf war tied to what Peter Mandelson, the senior British official in the province, today called ''the dark side of Northern Ireland's society, the mafia culture created by decades of paramilitary conflict.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Adair, who at the time of his release had served five and a half years of a 16-year sentence on terrorism charges, is a leading figure in the Ulster Defense Association, which has been locked in conflict with another loyalist group, the Ulster Volunteer Force. Ideologically, all of Northern Ireland's loyalist groups support continued British rule, but they are bitterly divided among themselves over personality and territorial disputes.</p>
        <p>The two men killed on Monday were said by the police to be members of Mr. Adair's organization. The police said the killers fired nine bullets into the men as they crossed a road to their car. There was speculation that Mr. Adair's arrest would increase pressure among his followers to retaliate.</p>
        <p>In September 1999, Mr. Adair was freed from the high-security Maze prison under terms in the peace deal enabling convicted terrorists to be released provided they refrained from violence. But the agreement also permits their so-called good behavior license to be revoked if they are thought to be fomenting violent actions.</p>
        <p>Explaining the arrest, Mr. Mandelson, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, said: ''My priority is public safety and I cannot give freedom to an individual intent on abusing it. I am satisfied that this particular individual has breached the terms of his license.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, he told reporters: ''We should be absolutely clear that what we are witnessing has nothing to do with the peace process. It's nothing more or less than squalid, murderous gang warfare.''</p>
        <p>Before Monday's killings, at least 10 people were hurt and a number of buildings set ablaze. BBC television reported tonight that some residents of the Shankhill Road area were boarding up their homes and leaving in anticipation of further clashes.</p>
        <p>The Belfast police said on Monday that the army was returning to the city's streets today as ''a short-term measure.''</p>
        <p>British soldiers withdrew from Belfast after the 1998 peace deal but troops returned briefly last month after the authorities banned a Protestant march through a Catholic area of the city.</p>
