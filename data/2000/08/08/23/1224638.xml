        <p>No, that wasn't a Judith Leiber minaudiere I was carrying out of a restaurant a while ago, just my dinner leftovers, in foil twisted to look like a swan. Now restaurants are growing even more clever, creating doggie bags that could win a blue ribbon for best of breed.</p>
        <p>Shopping bags with the restaurant's logo, a la Tiffany's or Henri Bendel, are the norm at Tapika and Michael Jordan's: The Steak House. Tocqueville packages leftovers in sleek black plastic, while at Tropica, Cafe Centro, the Brasserie and Brasserie 8 1/2, food is packed in Tupperwarelike containers handsome enough to make your Sub-Zero proud. They also don't leak, even in a jostling taxi.</p>

        <p>Some leftovers come with extra goodies, like the crisp sesame flatbread that Sono tucks into its bag, right. Dylan Prime adds a cup of its own steak sauce and some cookies, and Tonic gives you petits fours. Eleven Madison Park inserts a note from the chef, thanking the customer for enjoying the food so much that it was worth taking home.</p>
