        <p>Summer is supposed to be the slow season in the online brokerage business, but this one has not been quiet in Omaha, the home of the Ameritrade Holding Corporation.</p>
        <p>Ameritrade, the fifth-largest online brokerage firm, was contending with a deep slump in its stock price when its new chief executive, Thomas Lewis, abruptly resigned two weeks ago. Since then, Ameritrade's stock has been driven up by speculation that the company will be acquired. That rise accelerated yesterday, fueled by a rumor that the American Express Company might buy Ameritrade.</p>
        <p>Early in the day, shares of Ameritrade rose 20 percent, to more than $19, on the Nasdaq stock market. But without any sign of a buyout, they dropped back to close at $17.06, up $1.13, or 7 percent, in the heaviest volume in five months.</p>
        <p>Representatives for American Express and Ameritrade declined to comment on the speculation, although Dow Jones Newswires reported that an Ameritrade spokesman had said that the company was not for sale.</p>
        <p>Analysts were skeptical about the likelihood of an imminent buyout by American Express, but several of them have said that they consider Ameritrade a takeover target, especially in the wake of Mr. Lewis's departure. The company has said little about the surprise resignation, except to describe the reason for it as personal. J. Joe Ricketts, the company's founder and chairman, is acting as its chief executive while the company searches for a replacement.</p>
        <p>Scott Appleby, an analyst at Robertson Stephens, said he considered American Express a possible buyer because it had shown interest in an another online brokerage, E*Trade Group. Neither American Express nor E*Trade would comment on whether they had discussed a merger.</p>
        <p>Mr. Appleby said he expected Ameritrade to earn about 85 cents a share next year. The company's stock is trading at 20 times that estimate, and Mr. Appleby said American Express could pay as much as 30 times earnings in a stock-for-stock acquisition.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Appleby said he did not see American Express, a premium-brand company better known for its charge cards than its brokerage operation, as an ideal match for Ameritrade, which heavily advertises trading commissions as low as $8. ''I would prefer to see consolidation within the industry, rather than from outside,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What American Express and Ameritrade do share is a willingness to give away stock trades to attract customers. Late last year, American Express began offering free online stock purchases for people who keep at least $25,000 in an account. Earlier this year, Ameritrade quietly matched that offer by creating a separate, pure electronic brokerage firm called Freetrade, which does not charge commissions on some online trades. Both companies are also running investing contests on their Web sites this summer.</p>
        <p>Despite those similarities, some analysts said they thought Ameritrade was a better fit for a bank or brokerage firm.</p>
        <p>''I'm of the opinion that three to five years from now, most banks, if not all banks, will have some sort of online brokerage capability,'' said Matthew Vetto, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ''If you're looking for critical mass in a pure-play broker,'' he said, Ameritrade is the most attractive choice.</p>
