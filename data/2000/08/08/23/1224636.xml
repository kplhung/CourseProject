        <p>WHEN corn is very young, you can eat it whole; the cob has as much flavor as the kernels. But once it reaches four or five inches, the cob is inedible. Still, all that flavor remains, and it's a shame not to take advantage of it. The best way to do that is to use the cobs as the base for a corn chowder.</p>
        <p>It's so easy that it should inspire you to move beyond the basic soup and experiment with flavors from around the world.</p>
        <p>After stripping the kernels off a few ears, you can use the cobs to make a quick stock. All it needs are something like potatoes to add substance, seasonings and the corn.</p>
        <p>The entire process takes just about half an hour, and the result is a thick, satisfying vegetable stew.</p>
        <p>At its simplest, chowder contains little more than corn, onion, potatoes and milk; a couple of chopped tomatoes and a handful of parsley add flavor and color (if you left out the milk, you might think of this as Manhattan corn chowder). Starting with bacon and finishing with cream makes a richer version of the dish.</p>
        <p>But leaving the traditional flavors behind is more fun.</p>
        <p>I add curry powder and ginger and finish the chowder with sour cream and cilantro for a more exotic taste. When the potato is replaced by rice and the cream with coconut milk, Southeast Asian seasonings can be added to make a chowder that has little in common with the original, yet still has intense corn flavor.</p>
        <p>A combination of chili powder, lime juice and cilantro, again with sour cream, will give the chowder a Mexican character; you might thicken it with corn tortilla chips.</p>
        <p>My technique for stripping the kernels from the cobs is simple: after shucking the corn, stand the ears up in a shallow bowl, and run a paring knife down the sides.</p>
        <p>For maximum efficiency, strip the corn and get the cobs simmering in water first; then chop the onion while the oil is heating, and peel and chop the potatoes as the onions are cooking. At that point, almost all of the work is done.</p>
        <p>As long as your corn is young and tender, the kernels should be held out until the chowder is just about ready, so they don't overcook. But the new supersweet hybrids, which will retain much of their flavor for a few days, are not as tender, and their kernels should be cooked for a few minutes at least. Just keep tasting, and stop cooking when their texture seems right.</p>
        <p>BASIC CORN CHOWDER  Time: 30 to 40 minutes</p>
        <p>4 to 6 ears of corn  1 tablespoon butter or neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed  1 medium onion, chopped  2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 tomatoes, cored, seeded and chopped (optional)  1 cup whole or low-fat milk</p>
        <p>1/2 cup chopped parsley (optional).</p>
        <p>1. Shuck corn, and use a paring knife to strip kernels into a bowl. Put cobs in a pot with 4 cups water; bring to a boil, cover and simmer while you continue.</p>
        <p>2. Put butter or oil in a saucepan, and turn heat to medium-high. When butter melts or oil is hot, add onion and potatoes, along with a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion softens, about 5 minutes; add tomatoes and cook, stirring, for another minute or two.</p>
        <p>3. After corncobs have cooked at least 10 minutes, strain liquid into onion-potato mixture; bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer. When potatoes are tender, add corn kernels and milk, and heat through. Taste, and adjust seasonings. Garnish with the parsley, and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Variations: Corn chowder with bacon and cream: In Step 2, substitute  1/2 cup chopped bacon for butter or oil; cook over medium heat until it renders some of its fat, then add onion. In Step 3, use heavy cream or half-and-half in place of milk.</p>
        <p>Curried corn chowder: In Step 2, use oil, and add 1 tablespoon each curry powder and peeled and minced ginger to the onions. In Step 3, use sour cream in place of milk; garnish with cilantro in place of parsley.</p>
