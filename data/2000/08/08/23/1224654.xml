        <p>Who was the greatest actor in the English-speaking world? The question arises with the death this year of two of the primary candidates for that title, John Gielgud and Alec Guinness. Along with Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, they were the great knights of the English theater.</p>
        <p>For many, Gielgud and Olivier were opposites, Gielgud with his eloquent voice, an instrument for the ages (of man and of Shakespeare), Olivier with his impassioned sense of the dramatic, physical as well as emotional. The truth is somewhat reversible. While Olivier customarily approached a role from the outside, choosing a walk and a look -- specifically a false nose -- for his character, Gielgud, the presumed intellectual, was more intuitive.</p>
        <p>In contrast, it might be said that Richardson and Guinness had similarities, especially in their gift for playing eccentric, often comic characters. But in his transformations Richardson retained a glimmer of himself, so that one did not always know if he was acting or being. Guinness abandoned all sense of self and was totally immersed within a character and often unrecognizable from one role to another.</p>
        <p>Within the quartet there was mutual admiration and, at least between Olivier and Gielgud, an edge of rivalry. Guinness, as self-effacing in print as he was in performance, wrote in his autobiography, ''Blessings in Disguise,'' that he was well aware that he was not in the same class as the ''greats.'' He added that his ''pleasure is in putting little bits of things together, as if playing with a jigsaw puzzle.'' Of the four, Guinness was the one who had the most substantial and successful film career.</p>
        <p>All were marked by their daring and the surprise they could bring to a performance, qualities that separate the talented from the unforgettable, as was also true of Edith Evans and Peggy Ashcroft. Among living actors, Michael Gambon, Anthony Hopkins and Ian McKellen -- all of them knighted -- have demonstrated their eligibility for that pantheon, as have Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Eileen Atkins. In the United States the contemporary candidates are fewer, partly as a result of the limited access that American actors have to classics.</p>
        <p>Michael Meyer, the translator and biographer who died recently, was unequivocal in his choice, and it was none of the above. In his memoir, ''Words Through a Windowpane,'' he said that the greatest actor he had seen was Frederick Valk.</p>
        <p>Valk, he explained, was a German Jew who was firmly established as an actor by the time Hitler came to power. In 1933 he moved to Prague and became a leader of the German theater there. In 1939, with only days to spare, he escaped from the Nazis and emigrated to England. He had already played a diverse gallery of great classical roles. With apparent ease he made the transition to the British stage.</p>
        <p>In quick succession he triumphed in Shakespeare and Ibsen and also proved to be a master of comedy. Valk had only a minor career in movies, appearing in supporting roles and often playing prison camp commandants. He died in 1956 at 61, just before he was scheduled to make his Broadway debut in Peter Ustinov's ''Romanoff and Juliet.''</p>
        <p>The closest he came to the United States was to play Shylock for Tyrone Guthrie at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario. Guthrie considered him ''a genial, gentle giant,'' whose voice matched his physique: ''a warm and velvety baritone with an upper register of extraordinary brilliance and power.'' He said that Valk's career was somewhat limited by his accent.</p>
        <p>Meyer made it clear that he was not alone in his critical judgment and said that two of the most important British critics of the 20th century, James Agate and Kenneth Tynan, shared his enthusiasm. The excitement of watching Valk seemed to provoke critics to soar into the linguistic stratosphere.</p>
        <p>When Valk played Othello to Donald Wolfit's Iago, Agate wrote, ''If Valk is not a great Othello, and if the duel with Wolfit is not magnificent throughout, then let me retire.'' After seeing the same production, Tynan, then an undergraduate at Oxford, wrote, ''I have lived through three hours on the red brink of a volcano, and the crust of lava still crumbles at my feet.''</p>
        <p>Later, as a professional critic, Tynan continued to extol Valk and to have the color red on his mind when describing him. Reviewing ''The Master Builder,'' he said that ''his Solness has made his star blaze red across all this continent, and other lights are tapers.'' He switched metaphors in mid-theme: ''He seemed an Alp, and when he fell from his crazy tower, the very fall of the House of Usher seemed like crackling match wood. Mr. Valk rules our stages.'' He was, he said, ''the best actor in England.''</p>
        <p>In his autobiography Guinness recalled Valk in Guinness's adaptation of ''The Brothers Karamazov'' as ''a bull of a man, simple and endearing.'' Meyer was most impressed by Valk's ''explosive power'' in Shakespeare. He added, ''No one, I think, was quite prepared for the equal mastery which he then showed in three Ibsen roles: Solness in 'The Master Builder,' Pastor Manders in 'Ghosts' and John Gabriel Borkman. All three are deeply inhibited men whose passion can find no satisfactory outlet.''</p>
        <p>In 1981 Meyer was having lunch with Richardson, several years after he had given exceptional performances in ''Borkman'' and ''The Wild Duck.'' Richardson suddenly asked Meyer to name the greatest actor he had seen. Meyer hesitated, out of deference to the other man at the table. After a pause, Richardson said, ''Valk?'' And both men agreed.</p>
