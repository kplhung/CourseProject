        <p>The New York Liberty began the season with a motivating motto, but waited until winning its first playoff game to break out the ''Unfinished Business,'' banners, T-shirts and posters.</p>
        <p>In the first half of the season, that slogan could have easily been misinterpreted.</p>
        <p>The Liberty, stumbling to a 7-9 record, was an unpolished work in progress: new, out of sync and out of shape. In the second half, however, New York (24-13) jelled and got into condition, and what was once new became business as usual.</p>
        <p>The Liberty trampled Cleveland, 81-67, Monday night to capture its second straight Eastern Conference title, and with it, the chance for revenge. New York opens the two-of-three-game Women's National Basketball Association finals tomorrow night in Madison Square Garden against the three-time defending champion Houston Comets, hoping once again to fulfill a goal that has eluded its players since the league began.</p>
        <p>In the inaugural year in 1997, the Liberty lost to Houston in the one-game final. Last year, Teresa Weatherspoon's magical long-range shot in Game 2 was not enough to beat an emotionally charged Comets team that bookended the Shot with two double-digit victories.</p>
        <p>''We were ready last year, but we just fell short,'' Weatherspoon said after Monday night's temporary euphoria. ''We have that opportunity this time and I believe that we can take advantage of that opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Tamika Whitmore, the Liberty forward who led all scorers with 19 points off feathery jumpers Monday, said, ''We want to win that championship and we're not planning to let anybody stand in our way.''</p>
        <p>Seeking their fourth-straight W.N.B.A. title, the Comets (31-5) were on their way to Manhattan yesterday afternoon. As much as Houston is flying on momentum, having swept the favored Los Angeles Sparks in the Western Conference finals after that same team had pounded the Comets three times this season, Coach Van Chancellor is worried. Not only has the Liberty won 13 straight at home, but it has also lost twice in the finals in three seasons. ''New York has all the incentive,'' Chancellor said.</p>
        <p>''They're going to be ready. They're playing with tremendous confidence, playing hard and together. They've got good depth and a great crowd.''</p>
        <p>''They are much better than last year,'' Chancellor added. ''I never doubted from the day they traded for Tari Phillips that that they would be Eastern Conference champs.''</p>
        <p>In the season opener in May, the Comets crushed the Liberty, 84-68. That day in Houston, Phillips did not play, having just joined New York. The 6-foot-2-inch forward did play in the second game on July 23 in the Garden, however, scoring 17 points to lead the Liberty past the Comets, 69-64.</p>
        <p>That day, New York improved its record to 14-10, proving it had reinvented itself. And that day, the Comets fell out of first place in the Western Conference for the first time since Aug. 17, 1997. Two games later on July 29 this season, the Comets hit their low point by losing to Los Angeles in Houston. They have not lost since.</p>
        <p>Houston guard Cynthia Cooper, who won her league's initial Most Valuable Player awards, has averaged 22.8 points in four playoff games, in an effort to forestall her announced retirement. She leads a superstar trio that includes the forwards Sheryl Swoopes, this year's M.V.P., and Tina Thompson. Houston's biggest change is that Janeth Arcain, a 5-11 small forward from Brazil, has been converted to point guard following the death from cancer of Kim Perrot last August.</p>
        <p>New York's changes are bigger. They start with Phillips, who was voted the league's most improved player, and who is averaging 14 points in the playoffs. ''She is as big a superstar as anybody,'' said Liberty forward Sue Wicks. ''Now we have a go-to player who loves the pressure. Not only can she score, she's great passing out of the double team.''</p>
        <p>Phillips has been quick to find Whitmore, the second-year pro who has lost more than 30 pounds since the start of the season and has given the Liberty versatility and toughness. So does Vickie Johnson, who has been a consistent star since 1997. She scored 14 points and had 10 assists Monday despite playing on a sprained right ankle.</p>
        <p>Becky Hammon is the long-range threat to complement Crystal Robinson (6 for 11 from 3-point range in the playoffs) that the Liberty lacked last year, when Hammon was a rookie. At 5-6, she has developed a fearless move to the basket to go with a deadly outside shot. Last year, Hammon averaged 2.7 points per game; this year, she averaged 11 points in the regular season, 12.4 in the five playoff games.</p>
        <p>Hammon scored 11 clutch points in Monday's victory and 17 points in the Houston victory. ''Definitely that's a confidence factor for us,'' she said of that July triumph. ''We know we can beat them here at home.''</p>
        <p>Hammon thrives on the attitude that motivates the entire Liberty team. ''I love proving people wrong,'' she said. ''And that's been the story of the New York Liberty for the past couple of years. We weren't supposed to make the playoffs, and this year we weren't picked to win it again. And they can keep saying 'no,' but we're going to keep coming at them stronger.''</p>
