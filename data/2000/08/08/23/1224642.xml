        <p>DECORATED in bold yellows, with bright lights and a preponderance of circles, the new Food Attitude shop near Union Square looks like nothing so much as a children's recreation room with at least the suggestion of those once-popular smiley faces. In fact, the name Food Attitude fairly reeks of the 1970's, when retail cuteness was a selling point.</p>
        <p>So does the food, with an assortment of quiches and other dishes that recall a time when Brie and mousse represented an exciting stretching of the nation's culinary bounds. Onion quiche ($6.50 with a green salad) is especially good, with a tangle of caramelized onions flavored with nutmeg in a savory custard and flaky crust.</p>

        <p>DECORATED in bold yellows, with bright lights and a preponderance of circles, the new Food Attitude shop near Union Square looks like nothing so much as a children's recreation room with at least the suggestion of those once-popular smiley faces. In fact, the name Food Attitude fairly reeks of the 1970's, when retail cuteness was a selling point.</p>
        <p>So does the food, with an assortment of quiches and other dishes that recall a time when Brie and mousse represented an exciting stretching of the nation's culinary bounds. Onion quiche ($6.50 with a green salad) is especially good, with a tangle of caramelized onions flavored with nutmeg in a savory custard and flaky crust.</p>
        <p>The rec room theme applies particularly to the playful desserts ($4.95), which are made  to customers' specifications. They include excellent mousses, in flavors like exotic-sounding Guanaja chocolate and mixed berry.</p>
        <p>While the desserts are quite good, the assembly line is incredibly confusing. First, you choose a base, like a meringue shell, chocolate cup or brownie, then a filling, like mousse or ice cream, and finally a topping, like hot chocolate sauce.</p>
        <p>It can be fun, if you're in the mood, or it can be frustrating. I tried to order plain mousse, but every effort was rebuffed. I guess in a playpen, you do as you're told.</p>
        <p>Food Attitude, 20 East 17th Street, (646) 486-6222. Delivery: 12th Street to 23rd Street, Lexington to Seventh Avenue (begins third week of September).</p>
