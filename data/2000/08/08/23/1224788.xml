        <p>MANHATTAN: PAPER PRIMARY PROTEST  The City Board of Elections refused yesterday to reprint ballots for the Sept. 12 primary that now omit Green Party candidates, and will force party voters to choose their nominees on paper ballots. Green Party candidates will be on voting machine ballots everywhere else in the state. Craig Seeman, the party's state election coordinator, said that it would sue the city in federal court and that the board's claim that there is no room on ballots for the Green Party candidates was unacceptable. The Senate candidates include Al Lewis, above, who played Grandpa on ''The Munsters''; Mark Dunau, a farmer from Hancock, N.Y.; and Ron Dugger of Manhattan, a former newspaper publisher.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: UNEMPLOYMENT PHONES QUIT  An automated service that allows unemployment recipients to claim benefits over the phone was out of order for 27 hours in New York City starting Monday morning, the State Department of Labor said yesterday. Hundreds of recipients who use the telephone system, called Tel-Service, may have been inconvenienced by the disruption, which was caused by a malfunction in a mechanism that routes calls, said Betsy McCormack, department spokeswoman. But, she said, the service was back by noon yesterday, and no one will lose benefits.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: RECORDS ON HIP SOUGHT  New York State's attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, has asked medical groups to supply information about cleaning contracts, building leases and political donations related to their work for the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York. Mr. Spitzer's office and the State Insurance Department have been investigating HIP, a nonprofit company that insures many city workers, and its chief executive, Anthony L. Watson, and whether HIP spent millions on executive perquisites and contracts for board members and friends of Mr. Watson. HIP has said it is cooperating with investigators.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: NO EXECUTION, NO PAROLE  A defendant convicted of capital murder who avoids execution  faces mandatory life in prison without parole, under a law signed yesterday by the president of the  State Senate, Donald T. DiFrancesco, left, who was acting as governor. The law was inspired by Thomas Trantino, who was sentenced to death in the 1963 murder of two law enforcement officers in Lodi, but was spared when the death penalty was declared unconstitutional. The death penalty has been reinstated, but Mr. Trantino, 62, is not subject to the new law and remains eligible for parole.</p>

        <p>MAURICE RIVER: SEX-OFFENDER JAIL WELCOMED  After months of resistance from Woodbridge Township, a 300-bed prison for sex offenders will be built 100 miles south, in Cumberland County. In exchange for $825,000 a year from the state once the prison is operating, Maurice River has agreed to accept the $20 million prison. Last year, the state decided to build the prison in the Avenel section of Woodbridge, on the grounds of East Jersey State Prison and next to the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center, which houses sex offenders during their prison terms, but Woodbridge challenged the decision in court. Maurice River, population 6,654, already has two medium-security prisons, which, combined, are its biggest employer.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: TEST SCORES RELEASED  New Jersey officials released a new round of standardized test scores yesterday for public school students in the fourth and eighth grades, but would not disclose the results for fourth-grade language arts literacy. In the writing section, students' scores were so low that the State Education Department's Language Arts Literacy Assessment Committee will review the test scores and the grading. The test, known as the Elementary School Proficiency Assessment, was taken by 80,000 fourth graders during the 1999-2000 school year. The fourth-grade science scores did not change significantly from the previous year, with 57.3 percent ranked as proficient. Fourth graders  improved in math, with 49.6 percent in the proficient category, up from 47.5 percent. The state's 75,000 eighth graders in public schools scored well in science and language arts, with more than 80 percent ranked proficient or advanced proficient . In math, 67.3 percent demonstrated proficiency, up from 68.5 percent.</p>

        <p>HOLLAND TOWNSHIP: BODY IDENTIFIED  A body pulled from the Delaware River on Saturday was identified as a Pennsylvania man who drowned last week after trying to ride the high water caused by the recent heavy rains, the Hunterdon County medical examiner's office said. The man,  Charles Weaver, 58, a high school guidance counselor from Riegelsville, Pa., fell out of his kayak Aug. 15 in the Musconetcong River.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: 3 LEAVE PAROLE BOARD  Three more members of the State Parole Board have stepped down or taken leave, following the resignation of its chairman. The board has been under pressure to explain a backlog of cases and has been under investigation by the state in connection with favorable treatment for inmates with ties to organized crime. Robert Egles, the board's executive director, took a leave of absence; another member, Peter Loos, asked not to be reappointed; and another member, Joseph Ferrera, resigned. Records have been seized from Mr. Egles and the chairman of the 11-member board, Andrew Consovoy, who stepped down on July 28.</p>

        <p>NEW HAVEN: SUITS AGAINST MALL PLAN  Make it 16. That's the number of lawsuits filed by opponents of New Haven's plan to build a $500 million mall just east of downtown. Yesterday, a suit was filed in Superior Court in Hartford by Westfield America, owner of a mall in Milford, claiming that the State Office of Policy and Management illegally approved $28 million in tax breaks for the project's developer. Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland, said Westfield simply wanted to stymie potential competition. The project is expected to add $7 million in annual property taxes and 3,000 jobs to New Haven's limping economy. Opponents say it will destroy downtown businesses.</p>
