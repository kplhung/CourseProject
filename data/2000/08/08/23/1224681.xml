        <p>Tiki Barber spent part of his off-season as a sportscaster for a local television station, an attempt to further his fledgling career in broadcasting and acting. If he could ad-lib a little personal commentary, he would like everyone to know he does not need to be coddled.</p>
        <p>''There's big plays in me,'' Barber said after Giants practice today. ''It's just a matter of finding them.''</p>
        <p>It's hard to contradict Barber's statement. He was the Giants' best offensive player last season and again this preseason, not counting quarterback Kerry Collins's impressive training camp. Barber could even be the starting running back when the season begins Sept. 3.</p>
        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel hoped to announce a starting running back before Friday's preseason finale against Baltimore, but said today that he would wait until next week before revealing his only unidentified starter. Barber will play sparingly Friday after an impressive first three games. The rookie Ron Dayne will get more carries, and Joe Montgomery, the halfback-fullback, will possibly see plenty of time at both positions, Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Dayne was expected to win the job easily after the Giants made the Heisman Trophy winner their first-round pick in the draft, and even Barber said today ''he's going to be our featured back.'' But Dayne has struggled to translate his college dominance to the professional game and has only 151 yards on 46 carries.</p>
        <p>Barber, meanwhile, has shown more explosiveness, gaining 156 yards on only 20 carries. With Montgomery missing one game with a cut lip and getting one carry last week, Barber has started all three preseason games and would seem the most likely running back to start the opener against Arizona.</p>
        <p>Barber is a dynamic back. His 13 catches lead the team in three preseason games and he also returns punts. Whether he starts or not, the Giants would rather be cautious on the number of snaps he gets and not run Barber's slender body into the ground or too many shoulder pads. Barber has other ideas.</p>
        <p>''They think because I got hurt my first year, that I'm vulnerable and not as durable,'' said Barber, who notes he has not missed a practice since suffering a knee injury in 1997, his rookie season. ''I don't want them to be cautious and have me sit on the sideline while we're not scoring. That's ultimately what I'm here for, to help us win. I don't care if I get this amount of plays or that amount of plays. I just want to win, but I can't help this team win if I'm not in games.''</p>
        <p>Barber says this with a smile, one which one day may be a fixture behind a camera. Today, it reveals no animosity toward the coaching staff. He was second on the team in rushing and third in receiving last season and feels he has proven he can take the pounding.</p>
        <p>Fassel argued that one of the reasons for Barber's strong season in 1999 was ''we didn't wear him out.''</p>
        <p>''I'm not afraid to put him in there and leave him in there, but I want to see if Ron Dayne and Montgomery and some of those guys can become a workhorse-kind of back and then we can utilize Tiki when we want to utilize him for certain things,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Barber may be the Giants' best back, although he called being the starter no more than merely an ''ego thing.'' If he starts, Barber does not want anyone to worry.</p>
        <p>''They're paying me to be overworked,'' he said. ''They're paying me to be hurting on Monday morning. It's not about can Tiki survive this game. Can he be effective and help us win and get ready for the next game, that's what it's all about.''</p>
        <p>Barber could replace the injured running back Sean Bennett in some of the plays the Giants designed before Bennett was told he needed season-ending knee surgery. But Bennett is 6 feet 1 inch, 230 pounds and offers a different package of skills than the 5-10, 200-pound Barber.</p>
        <p>Barber even joked with Bennett when it was thought his injury was minor. ''I have to do all your plays, too?''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Giants Coach JIM FASSEL said that quarterback KERRY COLLINS would play no more than one quarter Friday, with the backup JASON GARRETT taking the bulk of the snaps. . . . Safety SHAUN WILLIAMS (toe sprain) has been running this week and is expected to begin drills Wednesday or Thursday. He will not play Friday but Fassel hopes he will be ready for the regular-season opener on Sept. 3. . . . Tight end DAN CAMPBELL (strained hamstring) returned to practice on a limited basis and Fassel said the team would be cautious about playing him Friday.</p>
