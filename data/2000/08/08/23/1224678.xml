        <p>The Microsoft Corporation made a final plea yesterday to the Supreme Court to send its antitrust case to a federal appeals court for the ''onerous task'' of reviewing the record instead of hearing the appeal directly.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's plea came in a legal brief that answered a filing last week by the Justice Department, which urged the Supreme Court to hear the appeal directly. A fast-track appeal directly to the top court, the government said, was in the national interest because waiting for the appeals court to act could ''irreparably harm competition'' in the computer industry and could result in justice being ''denied through delay.''</p>
        <p>In its filing yesterday, Microsoft argued that the case is extremely complex and that the trial judge made a series of factual and procedural errors.</p>
        <p>Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who heard the lawsuit in Federal District Court, ruled earlier this year that Microsoft was a monopoly that had repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws. He ordered that the company be split in two, an order he later shelved pending appeals. Microsoft is appealing both Judge Jackson's ruling and his breakup order.</p>
        <p>Microsoft clearly plans to ask that Judge Jackson's work be given a detailed review on appeal -- a task, the company says, that would be handled best by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>
        <p>''The findings in this case,'' Microsoft stated, ''are not the product of even one level of impartial decision-making.'' In its filing, Microsoft said that Judge Jackson's handling of the trial and his ordering of a breakup without separate hearings on sanctions ''cast serious doubt on the reliability'' of his judgment.</p>
        <p>Legal experts say it is difficult to assess whether the Supreme Court will hear a direct appeal of the Microsoft case. The court will decide by the opening of its next session, in October, if not sooner.</p>
        <p>Under the stewardship of William H. Rehnquist, who became chief justice in 1986, the Supreme Court has been aggressive in limiting its case load, legal experts say. In the late 1970's and early 1980's, they note, the court routinely decided nearly twice as many cases as in recent years.</p>
        <p>But the Microsoft lawsuit, they add, is an extraordinary case. The antitrust Expediting Act of 1903, which was amended in 1974, permits direct appeals to the Supreme Court of civil antitrust cases brought by the government. Until the 1974 amendment, such appeals always went straight to the Supreme Court, but the revision of the Expediting Law let the court decide whether to take an appeal directly.</p>
        <p>Since 1974, the government has rarely asked for a direct appeal. The last time it did so was nearly 18 years ago, when the Supreme Court agreed to hear two appeals to the AT&amp;T antitrust consent decree.</p>
        <p>Legal experts point to the ''institutional forces'' in the Microsoft case that might prod the Supreme Court to take a direct appeal. The United States solicitor general and the Justice Department have made the request, and Judge Jackson has certified the case for fast-track appeal.</p>
        <p>''It should be hard for the court to say no,'' observed Andrew I. Gavil, a professor at the Howard University law school.</p>
        <p>Microsoft, however, says that saying no would be the appropriate choice. Although the company's brief said that ''no one is more anxious than Microsoft to see this case brought to a prompt conclusion,'' it went on to explain why it thought its case was different from the AT&amp;T case.</p>
        <p>The AT&amp;T case, Microsoft said, did not involve a review of a complex factual record -- a sharp contrast, in the company's view, from what would be required in the appeal of its own case.</p>
        <p>In its filing last week, the Justice Department made a spirited argument for direct appeal. ''The stakes in this case for the national economy are immense,'' the government said. ''If this case does not qualify for direct review under the Expediting Act, it is difficult to imagine what future case would.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft addressed those statements in its reply yesterday. ''The answer is: a case in which the nature of the issues presented and the state of the record make it suitable for direct review by this court,'' the company said. ''AT&amp;T was such a case; this case is not.''</p>
