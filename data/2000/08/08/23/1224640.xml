      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>THE triumph of French grapes in California has been so complete that cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay and the rest seem as integral to the state as San Francisco fog and Malibu mud. When California winemakers want to turn to exotica, they experiment with Italian grapes, like sangiovese or barbera.</p>
        <p>By historical standards, at least, the French grapes should have been the interlopers. Italian immigrants started many of California's early winemaking dynasties, and their names live on today: Martini, Gallo, Mondavi, Foppiano and Pedroncelli, to mention a few. Yet, when the industry came of age its focus was almost wholly on French grapes, perhaps because Italian wines were held in such low esteem.</p>

        <p>THE triumph of French grapes in California has been so complete that cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay and the rest seem as integral to the state as San Francisco fog and Malibu mud. When California winemakers want to turn to exotica, they experiment with Italian grapes, like sangiovese or barbera.</p>
        <p>By historical standards, at least, the French grapes should have been the interlopers. Italian immigrants started many of California's early winemaking dynasties, and their names live on today: Martini, Gallo, Mondavi, Foppiano and Pedroncelli, to mention a few. Yet, when the industry came of age its focus was almost wholly on French grapes, perhaps because Italian wines were held in such low esteem.</p>
        <p>But appreciation for Italian wines has risen in the last 25 years. Barbera, the most widely planted grape in the Piedmont, has most often been used in California as an anonymous blending grape. Now it is being grown more seriously and bottled on its own.</p>
        <p>Sangiovese, the prime grape of Chianti, took up only 186 acres in the whole state in 1990. By 1997, though, that figure had risen to almost 2,500 acres, the highest rate of increase of any red grape in that period, according to ''California Wine,'' by James Laube (Wine Spectator Press, 1999).</p>
        <p>While California sangioveses can vary widely, from soft, fruity mouthfuls to oaky blasts of tannin, I found many to be enjoyable, though overpriced, and very good with food. Some of the best versions are made in small quantities. Bruno d'Alfonso, the winemaker for Sanford Winery in Santa Barbara County, makes the excellent Di Bruno as a side project. It is sold in a few stores, but is more likely to turn up in restaurants.</p>
        <p>Just as the Italians have been experimenting with nontraditional blends of grapes to create the wines known as super-Tuscans, so have the Californians. Brewer-Clifton, which makes fine pinot noirs and chardonnays, makes a super-concentrated blend of sangiovese and merlot under the Palmina label, while La Famiglia, Robert Mondavi's label for Italian varietals, recently released its 1997 Colmera, 80 percent sangiovese blended with five other grapes. It, too, is impressive, and will be even more so after it ages a few years.</p>
