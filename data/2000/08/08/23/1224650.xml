        <p>Days of Jazz</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani doesn't always like the gatherings in City Hall Park, sometimes the site of protests. But the event scheduled for tomorrow through Sunday is different. By proclamation from the mayor, those are now J&amp;R Music World JazzFest Days, when the J&amp;R music and computer store on Park Row once again offers free concerts in the park. This year's festival includes performers like Carla Cook, Herbie Hancock, Joe Lovano, Branford Marsalis and David Sanchez. Performances begin at 5 p.m. tomorrow and Friday and at 1 p.m. on Saturday.</p>

        <p>Days of Jazz</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani doesn't always like the gatherings in City Hall Park, sometimes the site of protests. But the event scheduled for tomorrow through Sunday is different. By proclamation from the mayor, those are now J&amp;R Music World JazzFest Days, when the J&amp;R music and computer store on Park Row once again offers free concerts in the park. This year's festival includes performers like Carla Cook, Herbie Hancock, Joe Lovano, Branford Marsalis and David Sanchez. Performances begin at 5 p.m. tomorrow and Friday and at 1 p.m. on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Happy Ending</p>
        <p>The folk singer Pete Seeger, 81, has been reunited with the banjo he made 55 years ago and lost earlier this month. The police in Rosendale, N.Y., in Ulster County, said that Gary Schneeweiss Jr., 31, a self-employed painter, noticed a green banjo case beside a road on Aug. 8, the day it was reported missing. ''I saw Pete Seeger's name on the case, but it was just another name to me,'' he said. Mr. Schneeweiss called Mr. Seeger's wife, Toshi, and the banjo was returned on Monday at a bookstore in Poughkeepsie, where Mr. Schneeweiss was given a $500 reward.</p>
        <p>Art in Transition</p>
        <p>Grand portraits of French sovereigns like Louis XIV, the Sun King, introduce each of the three sections of an exhibition that opens on Saturday at the Columbia Museum of Art in South Carolina. But the tumultuous politics that led to the overthrow of the monarchy pervades the 76 paintings, on view through Oct. 29 in ''From the Sun King to the Royal Twilight: Painting in 18th-Century France From the Musee de Picardie, Amiens.'' The works by masters like Chardin and Fragonard, as well as lesser-known artists like Noel Halle and Carle Vanloo, reflect a shift from royal commissions to patronage by the emerging bourgeoisie. The show spans genres like religious paintings, landscapes, portraits and still lifes.</p>
        <p>Grand Reopening</p>
        <p>The European Painting and Sculpture galleries at the Brooklyn Museum of Art have been reopened after nearly a year. The reinstalled galleries, housing works by Goya, Picasso, Bellini, Jan Bruegel, Matisse and Braque among many others, are now organized thematically, with rooms devoted to narrative paintings, religious art, still life, genre painting and landscapes. Landcapes spanning 400 years, from Hobbema to Corot, Courbet and Derain now share space. And for the first time, religious paintings from the Cuzco School -- native and Spanish artists who worked in Peru and what is now Bolivia in the 17th and 18th centuries -- are on view in the European Galleries.</p>
