        <p>The World Trade Organization will allow the Canadian government to impose more than $1 billion in trade sanctions over the next five years on Brazilian goods to compensate for Brazil's illegal aircraft industry subsidies, Brazilian officials said today.</p>
        <p>The size of the sanctions, to be officially announced Monday, are the largest trade retaliation award in the W.T.O.'s five-year history.</p>
        <p>The Brazilian and Canadian governments have both said that they remain committed to reaching a negotiated settlement in the dispute. Canadian and Brazilian officials are scheduled to meet here Aug. 29 and 30. Three previous efforts to reach a deal failed.</p>
        <p>Canada had asked for $3.3 billion in trade sanctions over the next seven years to retaliate against export subsidies given to the Brazilian regional jet manufacturer Embraer, the country's largest exporter. Embraer's Canadian rival, Bombardier, has argued for years that Brazil's Proex export program, designed to compensate for high interest rates here, amounted to a $2.5 million subsidy per airplane.</p>
        <p>In response to the complaint, and a counterclaim brought by Brazil against Canadian subsidies for Bombardier, the W.T.O. ruled last year that both countries had violated international trade rules and required each to abandon its subsidy program. In a progress review earlier this year, the W.T.O. found that Canada had complied with the earlier ruling, while Brazil had not.</p>
        <p>Brazil has said that it will dismantle the Proex program for all new airplane orders, but will honor the subsidies on the $20 billion worth of aircraft already on order.</p>
        <p>The size of the sanctions the W.T.O. will allow Canada to impose was first reported in the Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, which placed the precise value at $1.3 billion, or $260 million a year until 2005. Brazil's foreign relations minister, Luiz Felipe Lampreia, said today that the figure was ''approximately'' correct.</p>
        <p>The W.T.O., which makes the rules for global commerce and resolves disputes between member nations, has allowed retaliatory trade sanctions on only a few other occasions. The largest award until now was granted to Ecuador, which was allowed to impose $201.6 million in tariffs on European Union goods after the E.U. failed to overhaul its banana-import system.</p>
