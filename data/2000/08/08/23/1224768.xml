        <p>The dogs knew it was coming.</p>
        <p>In the middle of the night, Michael McDonough's three Maltese terriers began barking frantically. Mr. McDonough, who had been sound asleep in bed, rolled over and looked at the clock, which said 1:45. And that is when it hit -- an earthquake in the suburbs north of New York City.</p>
        <p>''It was like thunder, but not quite thunder,'' Mr. McDonough said. ''I woke up, looked at the clock, and heard that noise like a bang, a big, loud bang or a rumble and then a little rumble after that, and you could feel the house shaking and the pressure.''</p>
        <p>For miles around Putnam County and across the state line in Fairfield County, Conn., the tiny earthquake -- with a preliminary magnitude of 2.5, according to the National Earthquake Information Center -- jarred people with a few brief seconds of terrifying sound and force.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of frightened people called 911, local police departments or the county sheriff. But officials said today that there were no injuries and no reports of damage. Many people thought their boilers had exploded. Several said they had looked out a window to see if a car had crashed into their homes.</p>
        <p>Jeanne Buck, who works at the Carmel public library, was awakened by the jolt. In the fuzziness of sleep, she said to herself, ''If I didn't know better, I'd think this was an earthquake.'' Her four daughters, also stirred out of bed, thought someone was setting off fireworks.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mrs. Buck's home in Patterson, N.Y., a town of about 11,000 people about five miles northeast of Carmel, was near the epicenter of the quake, according to the earthquake information center in Golden, Colo., a division of the United States Geological Survey.</p>
        <p>''The thing of it is, at that time of morning, everybody was probably kind of asleep,'' said Waverly Person, a geophysicist at the earthquake center. ''And waking people up, it was probably kind of frightening, even thought it was what we call a really minor earthquake.''</p>
        <p>''Minor earthquakes are from 3.0 to 3.9,'' he said. ''So this falls below minor.''</p>
        <p>Earthquakes are unusual in the New York region but do occur. Researchers have documented at least 400 in the state since 1730, although quakes causing even moderate damage have been extremely rare, happening about once every 20 years.</p>
        <p>The state, like the rest of the Eastern United States, lies outside the world's three prominent earthquake belts, where more than 95 percent of the world's earthquakes occur. Unlike in California, where there are numerous fault lines visible on the earth's surface, most of the faults in New York are deep underground and have never been mapped, Mr. Person said.</p>
        <p>The most powerful quake on record in the region was in 1944. It was centered in Massena, N.Y., and had a magnitude of about 6.0 on the Richter scale, a measurement of magnitude no longer widely used by seismologists. It was felt as far north as Canada, as far south as Maryland, and from Maine to Indiana.</p>
        <p>This morning's quake has been the talk of Carmel, a town of more than 31,000 people that is the Putnam County seat, and of neighboring towns like Kent and Patterson. The shock was even felt in Danbury, Conn., about 15 miles away.</p>
        <p>''It's been a big topic of conversation,'' said Eric Schweitzer, the night manager of the Carmel Diner Restaurant downtown. Most nights, the diner would be the only place open in Carmel at 1:45 a.m. But on Mondays, it closes early, so Mr. Schweitzer was home.</p>
        <p>''It was like if a truck hit its air brakes right outside your house,'' he said, rapidly pounding his fists on a counter to dramatize the earthquake's effect.</p>
        <p>''Everybody thought it was their oil burner,'' he said, adding that his 23-year-old daughter had become alarmed, and had asked him, ''Is it going to come back?''</p>
        <p>Like many people, Donald Smith, the deputy county executive of Putnam, said he slept right through the brief temblor. ''I didn't even hear it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Patterson has no specific disaster plan for earthquakes, said Rich Williams, who heads the town's planning department.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of plans for problems with the dams and other situations,'' he said, ''but earthquakes are one we haven't gotten around to yet.''</p>
