        <p>Imagine yourself at a dinner party at which you are seated between Lucifer, dressed as an English gentleman, and George Bernard Shaw, masquerading as Don Juan. While you may hear a lot of lively conversation and witty repartee, you may also find that by the time dessert rolls around you are stifling yawns and more than ready for the cigars and port.</p>
        <p>That's pretty much the situation with ''Don Juan in Hell,'' Shaw's sermon on what's wrong with the world and most of the people in it, which is now being staged at the Irish Repertory Theater. Like any soapbox oration, no matter how clever it may be at the outset, repetition can dull the effect. And Shaw has never been one to make a point once if he can make it two or three times.</p>
        <p>''Don Juan in Hell'' was originally written as a separate scene in the third act of ''Man and Superman.'' But running more than an hour and a half by itself, it is often staged as a separate theater piece. It is not really a play, inasmuch as it has no action, sets or plot and is usually presented as a concert reading, the format chosen by Charlotte Moore, director of the Irish Repertory revival.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moore has assembled a cast of four respected actors -- Celeste Holm, Fritz Weaver, James A. Stephens and Donal Donnelly -- and seated them behind music stands with a copy of the script in front of them. The men are in black tie (though Mr. Donnelly's Lucifer wears red waistcoat and socks, as befitting the Devil), and Ms. Holm is elegant in an apricot ball gown with glittering choker.</p>
        <p>The conceit -- it is a dream sequence in the play -- has the principal characters of Tirso de Molina's 17th-century drama, better known from Mozart's 18th-century opera, holding a reunion in hell. Dona Ana has just arrived, quite surprised to find herself there and not the other place, and is greeted by Don Juan, her seducer and the murderer of her father. They are soon joined by her father, the Commendatore, who is visiting from heaven and wants to change addresses, and by Lucifer, the old Devil himself.</p>
        <p>What follows is a typical Shavian discourse in which Shaw, a k a Don Juan, holds forth on how the world is topsy-turvy and nothing is as it should be. For example, he disdains the denizens of hell for admiring attributes that most humans deem worthy -- ''honor, duty, justice'' -- but that he labels ''the seven deadly virtues.'' He complains that his neighbors in hell spend all their time talking about love and art and beauty, while in heaven the residents spend eternity in blissful contemplation of how life might be improved. Don Juan wants to abandon the pleasures of hell for the rigors of heaven, if only ''to escape from the eternal pursuit of happiness'' in the netherworld.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the argument is Shaw's appeal on behalf of the Nietzschean ''life force.'' But along the way he gets in a few digs at the English (''the country with the largest following of the Devil is England''), takes some swipes at conventional morality (''the English think they are moral when they are only uncomfortable'') and delivers a few blows for feminism and pacifism. But at a certain point a dialectic can easily turn into a diatribe, and without any real engagement among the other participants that point can come early.</p>
        <p>One of the drawbacks of such a concert performance is that the actors never get to fully develop their characters. No one in this chamber quartet has their lines cold, and most keep their eyes on the text in front of them. Even then there are odd pauses as one actor or another loses his place, and only occasionally is there any real interchange in which the actors look at or appear to be listening to one another.</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Moore's cast of actors are veteran pros who bring considerable technical expertise to the undertaking, and Shaw could not ask for more poised advocates. Mr. Weaver, as Don Juan, has by far the biggest and most difficult part, and he is furthest along in finding a real character to play. Mr. Donnelly's portrayal of the Devil is impish and wonderfully understated, especially in his exchanges with Mr. Weaver and a monologue on the propensity of humans for inhumanity. Ms. Holm and Mr. Stephens, as Dona Ana and her father, are mostly foils for Don Juan, but both give animated readings that find moments of humor.</p>
        <p>Yet for all the polish of the cast, the exercise never quite rises above what it is: a staged reading of a long-winded disputation.</p>
