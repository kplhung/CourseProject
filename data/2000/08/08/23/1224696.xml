        <p>THE Garden is rocking for the finals. The plucky old warrior leads the team onto the court, pumping a fist, making eye contact with the fans, letting everybody know, hey, we're in this together. This time we go all the way! It's a veritable lovefest.</p>
        <p>That's Teresa Weatherspoon we're talking about, doctor. You were thinking maybe Patrick Ewing?</p>
        <p>It is definitely hoops time. The Liberty takes on the Houston Comets tomorrow night, and maybe Spoon will unleash one from halfcourt, the way she did last year in the finals.</p>
        <p>Instead of getting caught up in the Liberty's quest for a championship, however, New York is obsessing upon the melancholy saga of Patrick Ewing. The Knicks cannot keep him. It has gone too far. The complicated four-way deal collapsed for reasons that should not preclude another deal.</p>
        <p>The Pistons got cold feet about looking like scavengers at a yard sale? It does seem rather larcenous to charge National Basketball Association prices for a collection of anonymities, but that's how things are done these days.</p>
        <p>None of this will keep the Knicks from cutting Patrick loose, and vice versa. You could hear the frenzy yesterday, like a million beavers chomping on a million logs, as Dave Checketts and Scott Layden tried to cook up a new deal. It would be even sadder if there were real regret on either side, but Patrick never much warmed up to New York, and New York never much warmed up to Patrick. That is to say, he was no Melvin Mora.</p>
        <p>The nice people in New York today are the ones saying kind things about Patrick, how hard he sweated, how many points he scored, how close he came. They are good fans, good people; may their numbers increase.</p>
        <p>They stuck with Ewing when the ball popped out of his undersized hands. They cheered him when he missed a foul shot in the final minute. They shrugged off his lack of imagination on and off the court. They remember the hundreds of great nights when he won big games for them, and the joint was rocking.</p>
        <p>He didn't have to win a championship here. That stuff is overdone. Lots of great players -- and great people -- don't win championships. Don Mattingly went down slashing in his one and only playoff series in 1995. So what? Ernie Banks and Sammy Sosa have zero World Series between them. So what?</p>
        <p>For Ewing, the dissatisfaction had nothing to do with rings. He was aloof when he came to New York and he is leaving aloof.</p>
        <p>To be fair to Ewing, he had been through a lot before he ever got to New York. He was an immigrant from Jamaica who heard ugly jibes when he started playing in Boston, and at Georgetown he could not miss the racism in banners that said ''Ewing You Can't Read This'' when he played at other Big East schools.</p>
        <p>He was fortunate to have a father figure in John Thompson, but he may have held on to the Paranoia for Freshmen much longer than even Thompson would have wanted. Ewing usually reacted as if the world was against him, which is perfectly understandable, but he could never master the graceful gesture. Too many people have told stories about Ewing refusing to sign autographs in hospitals or at benefits.</p>
        <p>''I never sign on game day,'' he would say, a charming way to be remembered by people who had random encounters with him.</p>
        <p>Nobody said athletes must be grateful, but they do run the risk of being judged. Ewing was given a whopping new contract a few years ago. He was a poor choice to lead the players during the labor troubles. He couldn't keep in shape during the lockout. In the executive suites at the Garden they were bad-mouthing him big time, and it never got better.</p>
        <p>There is a debate about whether Ewing held back the Knicks, but that is splitting hairs. When he asked for another extension of his contract, all of a sudden you could hear the Garden people saying: ''Do we have to keep him? For what?'' That's just the way it works. John Thompson surely explained it to him many years ago.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers need not beat themselves up over chasing Ewing away. (Did you really think New Yorkers would beat themselves up over anything?) Too many cool people, young and old, have come to New York and gotten it, including, most recently, Teresa Weatherspoon. Check out the energy when Spoon leads the Liberty onto the court tomorrow night. It was that way in Patrick Ewing's seasons, but now it will never happen again for him, at least in this town.</p>
