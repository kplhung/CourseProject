        <p>Former baseball greats--including Pete Rose, Joe Morgan, Nolan Ryan and Bob Gibson--and some current players, such as Derek Jeter, reminisce at five-inning celebrity charity softball game at Yogi Berra Stadium at Montclair State University in Little Falls, NJ; photo (M)</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Joe Morgan, it was mentioned to Pete Rose, had said that Rose should not be in the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to dislike him because he has an opinion,'' Pete Rose said. ''I love Joe Morgan.''</p>
        <p>Nearby, Joe Morgan said: ''I didn't say he didn't deserve to be in the Hall of Fame as a player. I played next to him. If anybody knows Pete's value as a player, I do. What I said was that he shouldn't be in the Hall of Fame until he apologizes for gambling on baseball. And then we can get on with the rest of our lives.''</p>
        <p>Rose still refuses to admit that he gambled on baseball while wearing a major league uniform. Football, yes. Horses racing, yes. Baseball, no. Emphatically no.</p>
        <p>''My opinion on it is in my book,'' said Morgan.</p>
        <p>''Nobody read it, anyway,'' said Rose, with a sideways grin.</p>
        <p>''Well,'' said Morgan, with a laugh and a shrug, ''I got paid for it.''</p>
        <p>And Bob Gibson's thoughts on the ever-controversial subject? ''It's something you just can't win,'' he said. ''You'll make enemies in whichever position you take.''</p>
        <p>The old fireballer, that famously fearsome competitor, was more forthcoming, however, on the Roger Clemens-Mike Piazza contretemps, in which Clemens of the Yankees beaned Piazza of the Mets.</p>
        <p>''It defies an outside opinion whether Clemens threw at him intentionally or not,'' said Gibson. ''Only he knows.</p>
        <p>''But inside pitches, or brushbacks, are part of baseball, and a hitter knows that. If you can't get to the plate and pay attention, you have no business being there.''</p>
        <p>Rose, Morgan, and Gibson, along with Nolan Ryan, from the geriatrics set, and Derek Jeter, of the comparative kiddie corps, were taking part in a five-inning celebrity charity softball game today on the ball park behind the Yogi Berra Museum here on the campus of Montclair State University.</p>
        <p>Four youngsters from around the country were randomly selected from a pool of entry applications through a Chips Ahoy/Derek Jeter on-pack entry that was available at K-Mart stores. The youngsters were allowed to invite three friends along. Proceeds from the game benefited the Make a Wish Foundation, and some of those youngsters participated in the game as well.</p>
        <p>One of the boys who won in the Chips Ahoy entry was Kyle Elliott, a 9-year-old from Saginaw, Mich. And he chose his sister, 10 1/2-year-old Kelly, to accompany him. She was the only girl selected to play.</p>
        <p>Why did Kyle choose Kelly? ''I felt like it,'' he said softly.</p>
        <p>And how did she feel about playing in the game? ''Nervous,'' she said. She added that her favorite player was Derek Jeter.</p>
        <p>Why the Yankee shortstop? ''Because he's really good at baseball,'' she explained patiently.</p>
        <p>It was a beautiful day for a ball game, even one with what appeared 20 or so people on the field, including the major leaguers who wore baseball caps and jerseys and street pants and street shoes. Never mind. The crowd, with many of the Make a Wishers and their parents in the stands, were whooping and hollering as if it were the seventh game of the World Series.</p>
        <p>''I know people look up to ballplayers,'' said Jeter, ''and so if you can do some good, you try to take advantage of it at this time.''</p>
        <p>''It's fun to be able to put a smile on kids' faces,'' said Rose.</p>
        <p>Morgan said he used to do a lot of charity work in children's cancer wards in Houston. ''But it got to be real tough to adjust to,'' he said. ''You come back the next year and they're gone. For an adult, it's wrenching to know that they aren't going to live out and enjoy their childhood.''</p>
        <p>Ryan, in another part of the field, was asked about his wife, Ruth, and how her catching hand felt, a question inspired by a TV commercial in which she catches his heat. ''Fine,'' he said with a laugh. ''But she really did catch me.'' With you throwing at 90-plus miles an hour? ''I used to throw to her every year before I went to spring training. About 80-plus miles an hour. I was just stretching out my arm. But she's the athlete of the family. She was a competitive tennis player. She caught our boys, too.''</p>
        <p>Jeter sat down next to Rose on the bench. ''Think you can break Pete's record?'' he was asked. Rose, of course, is the career leader with 4,256 career hits.</p>
        <p>''I doubt it,'' Jeter said. ''You gotta play a lot of years.'' Jeter, it should be noted, had more hits in his first four seasons -- 807 -- than anyone in baseball history.</p>
        <p>''It means nothing,'' he said. ''You have to get 200 hits for 20 years, and you're still not there.''</p>
        <p>''You know why he won't break it?'' Rose said. ''Because he makes too much money.</p>
        <p>''He'll be getting eight or nine million a year for the next few years. In 20 years, he'd have to be making $20 million a year. Nobody can afford that!''</p>
        <p>''He's my agent,'' said Jeter, throwing an arm around Rose's shoulder.</p>
        <p>Then Rose went up to bat. He hit a line drive that the shortstop, an adult employee from K-Mart, backhanded for an out. Rose ran halfway to short brandishing his bat. The crowd roared.</p>
        <p>He returned to the dugout. ''I hit a rope that time!'' he said, yet seemed slightly disappointed at being robbed of a hit.</p>
        <p>Somewhere else, Tom Kranendonk, an 8-year-old Chips Ahoy winner from Land O'Lakes, Fla., said he was a shortstop like Jeter, and admired him.</p>
        <p>Might Tom have some advice for Jeter?</p>
        <p>''Maybe,'' he said, ''he shouldn't strike out so much.''</p>
        <p>Appears young Tom also has the makings of a sportswriter.</p>
