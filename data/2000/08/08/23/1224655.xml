        <p>HOW, exactly, is a person supposed to get a margarita at the new Rosa Mexicano? The place is huge: two floors across from Lincoln Center. The bar, for some reason, occupies approximately 1 percent of this vast space.  It's like the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, people shouting and waving their arms about, frantically trying to place orders. Drop in there after work, and witness the sad sight of two attractive women shuffling back and forth on the periphery of the crowd, trying to get the bartender's attention.</p>
        <p>A terrible spectacle, but not an unusual one. Manhattan's restaurants are the most congested in the country -- and seem to be getting more so by the minute. Going out has become a battle of inches, from securing the edge of a bar stool to steeling yourself against the jostling of waiters, busboys and fellow diners in restaurants prized for having 13 tables. Even for hardened night life decathletes, walking into the new now place -- Pastiche, Bobo, Canard, whatever -- induces a fight-or-flight response.</p>
        <p>Which is why I subjected myself to a week of heat-seeking throngs. My hope was to learn how to navigate Manhattan's most mobbed bar scenes, where restaurant congestion reaches critical mass.</p>
        <p>For the first outing, last Tuesday, I brought my friend Doug, a writer and photographer who does not exaggerate when he says he spends every night of his life in a bar. Our first venue: Balthazar.</p>
        <p>The bar was bustling. A phalanx of skinny young things and the men who prey on them blocked access to a tantalizing wall of wine and liquor. We saw two empty stools, but a man sporting a blazer-T-shirt look was standing proprietarily over one of them. Doug, not a shy person, asked the fellow if he would mind moving to another vacant stool, farther down the bar, so we could have his.</p>
        <p>''You can sit here, but I'm not giving up my position,'' the fellow said, leaning into a conversation between two young women on the other side of him.</p>
        <p>So Doug sat and I stood. We immediately asked for drinks and a menu. Ordering food is an excellent way to claim a beachhead: the moment the cutlery and napkin arrive, you've doubled your real estate. By the time the steak frites came, we'd squeezed our friend out and over to a second-row spot facing the two women.</p>
        <p>''We've done this guy a major favor,'' Doug said, going on to offer a few recommendations for prompt bar service, in order of advisability:</p>
        <p>* Seek out the shortest people and get behind them -- same strategy as at a rock concert.</p>
        <p>* Wave a large wad of cash -- crass, but it still works in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>* Do the one-finger slam dunk, as if tipping a basketball in with the index finger, making yourself as tall as possible and gesturing at the same time.</p>
        <p>* Say: ''My wife's pregnant. She needs a Guinness.''</p>
        <p>Wendy Dechais, one of the women sitting next to us, revealed that she works on weekends as a bartender in Queens. Her advice? ''Anyone who leans over the bar and aggressively tries to get my attention will be the last person I will serve,'' she said. ''The best way is to be polite, like, 'I know you're really busy but when you have a moment . . . ' ''</p>
        <p>I tried out her technique the following night at Rue 57, the 57th Street version of Balthazar. I arrived, alone, at 7 o'clock. The room was medium-packed. I sidled up to a stool occupied by a purse and shopping bag that belonged to a nearby quartet of French-speaking women. I hovered by the stool, adopting a sideways stance and planting one hand on the edge of the bar.</p>
        <p>The bartender, who seemed older than his bottle-blond hair and gold hoop earring would indicate, was deep in conversation with two female patrons.</p>
        <p>''Married is single in my world!'' he said in a Down Under accent, clasping one of their ringed fingers in his hand. I considered asking him if this was something Bryan Brown had said in ''Cocktail.'' Then I remembered the polite approach.</p>
        <p>''Excuse me. . . . When you get a chance.''</p>
        <p>Nothing. I sensed I was not a member of his favorite gender. I locked onto the more approachable-looking bartender, resolved not to take my eyes off him till they made contact. (If a bartender looks at you and you're not looking back, prepare to wait another 20 minutes.) I'd been Hoovering edamame from a bowl on the bar, so I used this as my witty icebreaker.</p>
        <p>''These are good!'' I said, furiously popping the soybeans out of their casings and into my mouth.</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' he said. ''Can't stop eating them.''</p>
        <p>Connection made! It got me a beer and a menu. I was then free to focus on how others around me did it. One guy tried shouting over the row of people in front of him.</p>
        <p>''I'd like a chardonnay!'' he declared, as if to indicate confident familiarity with the grape.</p>
        <p>''What kind?'' my bartender asked with what sounded like a hint of irritation.</p>
        <p>''Whatever you like.''</p>
        <p>Another bartender would later tell me that her pet peeve is people who don't know what they want.</p>
        <p>I was then treated to the opposite approach, aggressive hostility. A short dark-haired woman charged the bar with such violence that my hand slipped on my pint glass, splashing her with a few droplets of beer foam. She shot me a death glare and fanned theatrically at the cigarette smoke coming from the woman on the other side of her. (Lighting up is a surefire way to expand your perimeter.) But I couldn't help but admire how fast she managed to get a menu in one hand, a fistful of edamame in the other and a round of drinks for her friends. This is New York. Sometimes, bartenders have also told me, pushy works.</p>
        <p>Being Canadian, I can't do pushy. Canadians are personal-space fanatics (we invented the white line on the highway), but we're too deferential to do much about it but fume and call it patience. This paid off when the French foursome finally left. I took their bag-storage stool and ordered a plate of oysters and littleneck clams. From my perch I could now watch a poor sap in a powder blue polo shirt, who'd been there as long as I had, wander aimlessly around a crowd that was now three deep. After a while, Powder Blue Man slammed his empty glass down in front of me and stalked out, as if I had somehow stolen his rightful place.</p>
        <p>Maybe I was getting the hang of this. Thursday night would be the true test. The T.G.I.T. crowd, out in force. I'd heard that when Guastavino's first opened under the 59th Street Bridge, people were turned away from the bar on Thursday nights unless they had dinner reservations. That was where I brought my friend Tad, a producer and program host on the Metro Channel.</p>
        <p>We were not denied. The bar was filled with very short, very tan patrons who looked as if they had spent too much time either in or reading about the Hamptons.</p>
        <p>''Yo, Rich! When ya get a chance.'' This was the voice in my ear mocking our own futile stabs at getting a drink. Knowing the bartender, or at least able to address him by name, is the ultimate weapon. It doubles, maybe triples, your range. You could be 20 feet from the bar and still get an order through with a ''Yo, Rich!'' in your arsenal.</p>
        <p>A friend and saloon scholar from Chicago had e-mailed me to this effect. ''Curry the favor of all bartenders in the joints you frequent,'' he advised. ''The key is to be well known for tipping generously and thus establish yourself as a beloved regular who knows a thing or two about the server. This limits your power to all but a handful of hangouts -- but I find it's always better to be treated with deference in your favorite haunts than to explore new ones and be made to feel like a loser all over again.''</p>
        <p>Tad likes to go for ''the pocket,'' the spot at the end of the bar under the television often left vacant by people who like to watch. No good here, as there is no TV. His other tactic is to scan the bar like a parking lot, looking for the equivalent of a brake light: anyone who looks as if he or she is settling up. We found one such opening, a narrow one, which I tried to enlarge by sticking out my chest and elbows. (This is a maneuver a friend calls ''fatting.'') After one beer and too many chicken wings, we left for more challenging territory.</p>
        <p>We found it at Red Rock West. This West Chelsea theme dive -- Hogs 'n' Heifers meets Coyote Ugly -- makes no delineation between bar and nonbar space, just an alcoholic mosh pit. In short, not an easy place to get a drink.</p>
        <p>Unless you happen to be 6-foot-6 and built like a professional wrestler. This was ''Land of the Giants'' territory, and we, a couple of average-size media guys, had made the mistake of bringing our womenfolk. Tad knows one of the Red Rock bartenders, Anne, who if she doesn't like the way someone asks for a drink will use the bar microphone to publicly abuse that person. (What sets her off is people who address her as ''Hello-o-o!'') But Anne wasn't working that night, making Tad just another loser trying to get a round of tequila shots.</p>
        <p>We were one layer away from the bar when I became aware of a huge forearm reaching over my head and a voice growling, ''Get me an Amstel Light and a vodka-tonic.'' A curt nod and it was done. The drinks were passed back over my head and handed to our dates.</p>
        <p>Things could have gotten ugly -- I might have had to rough some dudes up -- but it was at this moment that my date discovered that her ankle was bleeding. Enough bottles and glasses explode here -- on the floor, over someone's head -- that you write it off as background noise. Ambience. But she'd caught enough shards that we had to leave to assess the damage.</p>
        <p>''This is not a place for mules,'' she observed as we fought our way upstream toward the door.</p>
        <p>And our shots had just arrived.</p>
