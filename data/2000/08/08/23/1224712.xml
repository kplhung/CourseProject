        <p>Vice President Al Gore stood before fellow Veterans of Foreign Wars today and rebutted Republican charges that the readiness and morale of the armed forces had declined during the Clinton administration.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore stood before fellow Veterans of Foreign Wars today and rebutted Republican charges that the readiness and morale of the armed forces had declined during the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who served as an Army journalist in Vietnam for five months in 1971, told delegates to the Veterans of Foreign Wars national convention here of his own enlistment, his work on the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee, his vote for the Persian Gulf war and his support in the White House for increased defense spending.</p>
        <p>''It's that year-after-year commitment to a strong American defense,'' Mr. Gore said, ''that makes me so concerned when others try to run down America's military for political advantage in an election year. That's not only wrong in fact, it's the wrong message to send to our allies and adversaries across the world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, was referring to his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who preceded him here on Monday. Mr. Bush, who served in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War, said in his address to the veterans that ''the current administration had inherited a military ready for the dangers and challenges facing our nation'' but that ''the next president will inherit a military in decline.''</p>
        <p>He said the armed forces had suffered from poor pay, shortages of spare parts and deteriorating readiness in the days after his father was president and his running mate, Dick Cheney, was defense secretary.</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said today that Mr. Gore was refusing to take responsibility for the military's condition during the Clinton presidency.</p>
        <p>''If the military's morale had gone down under my watch,'' Mr. Fleischer said, ''I, too, wouldn't want my opponent to point it out.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore, who wore his own V.F.W. hat, defended the administration's record, saying that all 10 Army divisions were combat ready and that ''our military is the strongest and the best in the entire world.''</p>
        <p>As in his speech to the Democratic National Convention last week, and in a television commercial released by the campaign today, Mr. Gore promoted his decision to enlist in the Army in 1969. In his remarks, he did not mention, as he does in the advertisement, that he enlisted despite having doubts about the war.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Gore and his late father, Senator Albert Gore Sr., opposed the Vietnam War but the younger Mr. Gore enlisted, he has often said, because he knew that someone else from Tennessee would have to go in his place. Another factor he has mentioned was the potential damage to his father's 1970 re-election campaign if he had tried to avoid service.</p>
        <p>''I don't pretend that my own military experience matches in any way what others here have been through,'' Mr. Gore said today. ''I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform. And my own experiences gave me strong beliefs about America's obligation to keep our national defenses strong.''</p>
        <p>The vice president said he would push for a raise for military personnel and for improvements in military housing. He also pledged that ''in a Gore administration, I will make sure that no members of our armed forces ever have to rely on food stamps.'' About 6,000 servicemen and women are eligible for food stamps.</p>
        <p>''Our armed forces should be commemorated on stamps,'' he said. ''They shouldn't have to use them to buy groceries.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, said the vice president had  called for a 10-year, $127 billion increase in spending on military salaries, training and modernization and that those numbers may rise when Mr. Gore adjusts his budget proposals to reflect a growing surplus. Mr. Gore would maintain for 10 years the 3.7 percent annual increase in military pay that Congress passed and President Clinton signed this year, Mr. Lehane said.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Mr. Gore's running mate, was one of eight senators to vote against a 4.8 percent military pay increase in 1999. He has said he did so because it was part of a Republican Pentagon spending package that he considered too costly. Later that year, he supported a less expensive bill that included a pay increase of the same size.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said he would add $1 billion for an annual salary increase on top of the increases authorized in recent years. On Monday, he also proposed spending $310 million for construction and repair of public schools that serve the children of military personnel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion cut in income tax rates would be so deep that it would make it impossible to invest in the military.</p>
        <p>''I think it's wrong to spend our budget surpluses on short-term gain,'' he said, ''when we need to make sure the resources are there to keep our military strong far into the future.''</p>
