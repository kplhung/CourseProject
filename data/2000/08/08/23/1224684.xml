        <p>Ray Lucas is a brutally honest critic, a quarterback with a razor tongue used almost exclusively to slash himself. He was awful, he announced, after he had a particularly devilish time  in the Jets' 37-24 preseason loss to the Packers on Aug. 4, when he threw 2 interceptions and completed only 9 passes for 79 yards. The loss, he moaned, was all his fault.</p>
        <p>But even Lucas swelled a bit with pride after the Jets' 27-24 victory over the Giants last Friday in their final preseason game.</p>
        <p>With the starter, Vinny Testaverde, and the rookie Chad Pennington confined to the sideline with injuries, the show was Lucas's from start to nearly finish. In completing 19 of 26 passes for 286 yards and 3 touchdowns, Lucas laid to rest any concerns about the backup spot should Testaverde's return from a yearlong layoff not go smoothly.</p>
        <p>And he made a case that if Pennington really is the Jets' quarterback of the future, Lucas could be a capable starting quarterback somewhere else.</p>
        <p>''The best thing about Friday night was when I went over to the Giants' sideline and Jessie Armstead and Kerry Collins said, 'It's a pleasure to watch you play,' '' Lucas said. ''The respect from not only my team but from other teams is overwhelming.''</p>
        <p>Since Lucas's herculean effort to salvage the Jets' season last year after Testaverde was hurt, he has become a favorite of the fans and his teammates. His contentious off-season contract negotiations, which concluded with his settling for the one-year tender of the league-minimum $385,000 -- while Pennington got a $4.1 million signing bonus -- have turned Lucas into something of an unintended and uncomfortable martyr.</p>
        <p>Provided Testaverde returns for next season, the Jets could tender Lucas, who will be a restricted free agent after this season, at a high salary figure in order to secure a high draft pick from any team that wants to sign him.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't want him to go anywhere else,'' receiver Wayne Chrebet said. ''I'm a huge Ray Lucas fan. Given the opportunity, I think he could do great things starting for a whole season. He brings some excitement in there. You want to jump on his back and let him lead you.''</p>
        <p>Lucas spoke just once, early in training camp, about the contract situation, noting how difficult it is to trust anyone and indicating that his relationship with the Jets' director of football operations, Bill Parcells, who had been one of his biggest boosters, had soured since the talks. Since then, though, Lucas has handled his role with equanimity, even volunteering after his splendid performance against the Giants that the Jets are a better team with Testaverde at the helm.</p>
        <p>''I'm still young,'' Lucas said. ''I've got a lot of years ahead of me. I'm still learning from Vinny. I'm in a great situation. Vinny is going to be in there, we're going to win games. If something happens, we're going to win games.''</p>
        <p>Because of his extensive playing time against the Giants, Lucas ended up as the Jets' leading quarterback during the preseason, completing 44 of 65 passes for 496 yards, 4 touchdowns and a rating of 98, compared with  Testaverde's 70.4.</p>
        <p>It is a remarkable turnaround for a player who last year was just hoping to make the Jets' roster and who endured a miserable preseason game against Green Bay, before proving he was the backup the Jets desperately needed.</p>
        <p>''A year ago at this time, the team was worried about the quarterback position,'' Testaverde said. ''This year is a completely different story. We feel we have two guys who can win football games. I'm happy for Ray on the personal side. To see where he came from and where he is today is a great feeling.''</p>
