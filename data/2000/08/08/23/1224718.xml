        <p>The city's new Coney Island stadium for a minor-league Mets franchise will cost up to $8 million more than previous estimates, and the project continues to provoke bitter sniping between its biggest booster, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and its most vocal opponent, Howard Golden, the Brooklyn borough president.</p>
        <p>At a ceremonial groundbreaking yesterday on Surf Avenue, where construction of the 6,500-seat ballpark is well under way in the shadow of Coney Island's storied parachute drop, Mayor Giuliani said the city would spend as much as $39 million on the project -- more than 25 percent above its previous budget of $31 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani defended the additional cost, saying it was necessary to ensure its completion by opening day next June. That deadline, a year earlier than previously set by the city, means the Coney Island stadium, like a counterpart on Staten Island, will be completed before the mayor leaves office at the end of 2001.</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn stadium has been a longstanding matter of contention between the mayor and Mr. Golden, who for years strenuously promoted a grander sports and recreation complex for the site. And yesterday's ceremony brought them no closer together. Several top City Hall aides and Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island borough president, joined Mr. Giuliani at the ceremony, but Mr. Golden was not invited and did not attend.</p>
        <p>''It is unfortunate that the city administration continues to implement a sweetheart deal that offers little economic benefit to Brooklyn but is a windfall to professional baseball,'' Mr. Golden said in a statement released immediately after the event. ''Taxpayers deserve more for this huge public investment than an outrageous deal.''</p>
        <p>The Coney Island and Staten Island minor-league ballparks, which are being paid for with more than $100 million in city money, have been championed by the mayor to foster economic development in the boroughs outside Manhattan. The Staten Island stadium, budgeted at $71 million and under construction along the St. George shoreline, just west of the Staten Island Ferry Terminal, is to be used by a minor-league franchise of the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Although the Staten Island project will be the most expensive minor-league ballpark in the country, it has caused little upset, while the battle over the Brooklyn stadium has consumed Mr. Golden for more than a year. He has also maintained that its price is too high and that the caliber of baseball it will bring, with a single-A minor-league franchise, to the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, is beneath the dignity of the borough.</p>
        <p>Asked why Mr. Golden was not invited to the event, Mayor Giuliani angrily replied: ''Why wasn't he here? Because he is against this project. I can't imagine why.''</p>
        <p>Under terms of a 20-year lease agreement between the city and the Mets, the minor-league franchise will pay up to $520,000 a year, based on attendance, for use of the stadium. While the current home of the Mets' minor-league team in Queens sometimes draws fewer than 1,000 fans, the mayor said that he hoped a new stadium would attract larger crowds, and that if the stadium were at least half full for each game next year, he would be satisfied. In addition to lease payments, the city would receive half the advertising revenues that are generated by the franchise.</p>
        <p>But the mayor also sought to dismiss the points raised by Mr. Golden and other critics who say that the Coney Island project will provide a windfall for the Mets. He insisted that it would lead to sweeping economic development along the neighborhood's tawdry beachfront and commercial blocks.</p>
        <p>''This ballpark will do for Coney Island what Disney did for 42nd Street,'' he said, referring to the investment by the Walt Disney Company, backed by city tax incentives, in a Times Square theater and store in the early 1990's. He said the city would prompt further Coney Island development by paying for a Little League field close to the new stadium, for repairs on the rusting framework of the parachute drop, and for incentives to lure new stores to the blighted quarter-mile stretch of Surf Avenue between the stadium site and the historic Nathan's hot dog emporium.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giuliani declined to say which of those projects, if any, would be completed before he left office.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Michael Carey, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which is in charge of the stadium projects, said that the cost of the Coney Island field had grown because advancing its deadline meant bringing in more workers and materials at a time when both are in short supply.</p>
        <p>He said the city and the Mets had agreed to seek a corporate sponsor for the stadium, embracing a model of corporate support established by several professional sports organization around the nation as well as on Staten Island. Although no such sponsor has been found, Mr. Carey said he expected a company to pay for the right to include its name in that of the new Coney Island stadium, and that the arrangement would probably yield as much income as the $400,000 a year that the Richmond County Bank has agreed to pay to have the field in St. George named the Richmond County Bank Ballpark.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carey also said that the city and the Mets would select a name for the minor-league team from ideas submitted by the public.</p>
        <p>One suggestion was made immediately yesterday at the ceremony by Joan Hodges, the widow of Gil Hodges, the former Brooklyn Dodger first baseman and Mets manager. ''I respectfully submit the name of Gil Hodges,'' said Mrs. Hodges, whose presence was apparently intended by City hall to evoke the splendor of professional baseball in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani, who followed Mrs. Hodges to the microphone, was effusive in his praise of her husband, who died in 1972, but stopped short of seconding her nomination. Without referring to the naming process of Coney Island's new club, he said that Mr. Hodges ''truly deserves to be in the Hall of Fame,'' an honor not yet bestowed.</p>
