        <p>RENE FOSS, a flight attendant, jokes about flying ''around the world in a bad mood.'' In fact, she's written a musical revue with that title. More on that later. But first, a good word for business travelers from Ms. Foss.</p>
        <p>''The business traveler is my favorite passenger, mainly because they're used to the system,'' said Ms. Foss, who is 38 and has worked for Northwest Airlines for 16 years. ''As a rule, they're usually the best dressed, the best behaved, and the most sympathetic when there's a problem. They're the most sophisticated of the travelers.''</p>

        <p>RENE FOSS, a flight attendant, jokes about flying ''around the world in a bad mood.'' In fact, she's written a musical revue with that title. More on that later. But first, a good word for business travelers from Ms. Foss.</p>
        <p>''The business traveler is my favorite passenger, mainly because they're used to the system,'' said Ms. Foss, who is 38 and has worked for Northwest Airlines for 16 years. ''As a rule, they're usually the best dressed, the best behaved, and the most sympathetic when there's a problem. They're the most sophisticated of the travelers.''</p>
        <p>Wait, though. Let's not get carried away with the compliments. You know those self-important bozos you often see with a first-class upgrade and an attitude? (I recently watched a businessman waving his first-class ticket literally push a woman in a wheelchair out of the way so he could be the very first in line to board a flight to Phoenix.) Flight attendants encounter customers like that every day.</p>
        <p>''Well, with some business travelers, their demands have increased,'' she said. ''There is a sense of entitlement. They expect a little more, maybe because they're paying a higher price for the ticket, or they're angry because they've had a horrible experience on the previous flight, or whatever.''</p>
        <p>In fact, don't get her started. This is a woman who sends out information about her theatrical revue tucked in an airline barf bag. A woman who has written ditties called ''The Ballad of Jed Clampett,'' which describes the bewildered hordes of infrequent fliers who fly during the summer-sale season, and ''The Hello Song,'' in which overburdened flight attendants start out warbling sweet hellos that soon descend into a cacophony of fulminating rage. A woman who says modestly, ''I have written a musical comedy based on my rotten life, I mean, my glamorous life.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, referring to her day job in the sky, ''you get some of these young guys in first class, they think they're kind of hot shots,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''They'll get done with their meal and then they want to get their computer out right away, so they'll just put their garbage on the floor. They don't even look up when we come by to pick it up.''</p>
        <p>The abilities to ''take abuse and collect trash in confined areas'' are, in fact, prime job requirements for becoming a flight attendant, as an employment supervisor for Wafti (We Apologize for the Inconvenience) Airlines explains to the bright-eyed job-seeker played by Ms. Foss in her show, ''Around the World in a Bad Mood.''</p>
        <p>The musical revue has a cast of five, including one other working flight attendant. Originally produced in New York two years ago, it was a hit this summer at the Minneapolis Fringe Festival, a program of off-beat theater. The show, which is popular with off-duty flight attendants and other airline employees, returns to New York for four Saturday night performances next month at Rose's Turn, a Greenwich Village cabaret,  (212) 712-8702.</p>
        <p>Ms. Foss's mother was a flight attendant in the 1950's, when air travel was considered to be an elegant way to go. But she doesn't have any illusions about the way women were once treated as stewardesses who were there to pamper and flatter business travelers, who have always been the airlines' prime customers and whose ranks were overwhelmingly male until the 1980's. Remember those pouty, suggestive ''Fly Me!'' airline commercials?</p>
        <p>''When my mother was flying, the stewardesses wore white gloves,'' Ms. Foss said. ''But they also had to wear a girdle. They would come to work and have to be checked. Yes, the airlines had a girdle checker. And do you know what else? They had a weight checker. And if you were five pounds over what your weight was supposed to be, you were grounded till you lost the weight. Stewardesses would go on these awful diets, not eat for three days to try to lose five pounds.''</p>
        <p>Also, she said: ''They had to quit when they got married, which is why my mother left the business. They had a rule that at age 32, you had to quit, no matter what. So the life was glamorous in a lot of ways. Airline crews used to stay at much better hotels and enjoy longer layovers, for example. But at the same token, there was a dark side. There was a girdle checker.''</p>
        <p>Do we hear a song coming on there?</p>
        <p>Perhaps. Other possibilities for new material in the show include the prospect of passengers being able to use cell phones in the air, with all the ensuing drama, resentment and fury. ''Actually, that could be an opera,'' said Ms. Foss, who is always working on new material.</p>
        <p>''Not that I'm any big writer or anything, but for me the airline experience is fascinating to try to capture because it's sometimes so much like a drama or a comedy,'' she said. ''Honestly, it's like watching a play. You just stand there and observe quietly.''</p>
        <p>You'd never know she was a wiseacre, at least not on the job. ''I'm really not much of a smart aleck,''  she confided. ''I'm too afraid I'll get in trouble. I try to keep my mouth shut as much as possible.''</p>
        <p>Just remember, though. That flight attendant up there by the galley might well be taking notes.</p>
