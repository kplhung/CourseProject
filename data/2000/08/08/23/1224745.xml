        <p>Mirjana Lucic is trying to remember how to win. Harel Levy is just learning how.</p>
        <p>Both emerged victorious yesterday in the United States Open qualifying in Flushing. Now they must survive two more rounds to be among the 32 qualifiers -- the lesser-ranked 16 women and 16 men -- who will secure spots in the Open, which begins Monday.</p>
        <p>Levy, who disposed of Yong Il Yoon, 6-4, 6-3, is a 22-year-old Israeli who shocked the men's tour by reaching the final of a major tournament in Toronto two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Lucic, considered one of the up-and-comers of the women's tour just a year ago, pushed aside her No. 203 ranking to oust Yuka Yoshida of Japan, 6-4, 6-2.</p>
        <p>''Finally,'' Lucic said. ''I haven't won too many matches this year. I forgot what it feels like.''</p>
        <p>After the 6-foot player fired a robust service winner to end the match, about 10 autograph seekers gathered courtside. One called out Lucic's greatest achievement -- reaching the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1999.</p>
        <p>Lucic was genuinely moved. ''They didn't forget me,'' she whispered.</p>
        <p>Lucic, once ranked 32nd, was grateful to compete in the quiet of the qualifying. Some of the cameras are in place at the National Tennis Center, but they are not yet rolling. And the stands on the outside courts are ready as well, though spectators numbered in the dozens at most matches despite free admission.</p>
        <p>The low pressure suited Lucic just fine. She has a match record of 5-15 since her Wimbledon glory. In one stretch, she lost in the first round six straight times. Last week at a tour stop in Los Angeles, Lucic again stumbled in the first round.</p>
        <p>She said she had stopped training hard and had gained weight. The powerful ground strokes and first serve were there against Yoshida, but her consistency and mobility -- never a strong suit -- were not.</p>
        <p>''I chose a path not to work as hard, and this is what happens,'' Lucic said.</p>
        <p>Lucic, 18, said her family's estrangement from her father, Marinko, has not been a factor in her decline. Lucic, her mother and four siblings left Marinko Lucic in Croatia in the summer of 1998 after what they said was a lifetime of being physically abused by him.</p>
        <p>The final straw, Lucic had said, was when Marinko Lucic beat both her and her mother after Lucic lost in the '98 doubles final at Wimbledon. The family fled to Florida and has not had any contact with him since. Lucic's father has denied the accusations.</p>
        <p>Lucic is now coached by Harold Solomon, who watched her rebound from an 0-40 deficit against the light-hitting Yoshida's serve to take a 5-2 lead in the second set, and then close out the match by holding serve decisively.</p>
        <p>Levy, a skinny 6-foot right-hander with whiplike ground strokes, was ranked 144th when the Toronto Masters began in early August and the Open's main-draw acceptances had already been closed to the top 104 players. Then Levy defeated Martin Damm, Stefan Koubek, Sebastien Grosjean, Jerome Golmard and Jiri Novak to reach the final. Levy lost to Marat Safin in the championship but jumped to No. 70 in the ranking. Yesterday, Levy attracted hundreds of spectators, some of whom spoke Hebrew. The last Israeli to win a professional tournament was Amos Mansdorf in 1993, so Levy's near-breakthrough has created a stir among his countrymen.</p>
        <p>''It's been a long time and now that I did it all in one week, they are all very excited,'' Levy said. ''The media is going crazy and I hope that they will not judge me on only the week in Toronto but throughout the year.''</p>
        <p>Levy lives in a city near Tel Aviv called Ramat-Hasharon. He completed his military duty just 10 days ago.</p>
        <p>Levy has a tantalizing drop shot and hits most winners off his one-handed backhand. Except for one hiccup in which he committed six unforced errors in seven points to enable Yoon to climb within a 5-3 deficit in the second set, Levy played consistently.</p>
        <p>Levy said he needs to improve on his forehand and his serve.</p>
        <p>''I have to get used to this level as fast as possible,'' he said.</p>
