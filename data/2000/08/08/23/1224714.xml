        <p>When Yusuf Oumar saw early this year that politicians here were adopting Islamic Shariah law and planning to enforce it by segregating schools and taxis, not to mention caning drinkers and amputating hands of thieves, he made the only sensible decision he could think of: he moved here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oumar, 37, a petty trader, packed up his goods and his family, leaving the center of this West African nation for Gusau, the capital of the small, formerly obscure state of Zamfara in the dusty northwest.</p>
        <p>Delighted with this place, he has  built a house here and set up shop in the middle of town in a new market populated by recent arrivals like himself.</p>
        <p>''I love Shariah,'' Mr. Oumar said the other day, behind a table laden with gadgets with seemingly familiar names like ''Suny'' tape recorders and ''Naiwa'' radios.</p>
        <p>He explained that no one cheated, stole or haggled in the market, thanks to the Islamic legal code. ''But even now our Shariah is not yet like the one in Saudi Arabia,'' he said. ''But in time, by the grace of God, it will be like that.''</p>
        <p>Since Zamfara acted, seven other states have embraced the laws of the Koran in predominantly Muslim areas of northern Nigeria. The latest one, Borno, held a ceremony to adopt it on Aug. 19, a week before President Clinton's scheduled visit to Nigeria.</p>
        <p>If this state is a harbinger, this country of 36 states divided uneasily between Muslims and Christians seems likely to experience a hardening of those divisions. In a development that risks further undermining the fragile unity of Nigeria and its 15-month-old democracy, Muslims have been moving into the Shariah states and Christians moving out, according to interviews here and with officials from other areas.</p>
        <p>Since a series of deadly religious clashes in the north recently, many Christians have relocated to Jos, a traditionally Christian city that is geographically the closest to the predominantly Muslim north, said Rima Shawulu, 38, an aide to Nigeria's House speaker, Umar Ghali Na'Abba. The influx is raising rent and land prices, he said.</p>
        <p>''The fear of the Christian population is widening the Christian-Muslim gulf,'' said Mr. Shawulu, who commutes to Jos on weekends from Abuja, the national capital. ''Increasingly it's becoming difficult to have common ground.''</p>
        <p>It was late last year that ambitious politicians in Zamfara, backed by powerful northerners who had fallen out of favor in the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo, began calls for Shariah. The move proved so popular that other Muslim politicians, who initially were dismissive, could not but follow suit.</p>
        <p>''Some people are using Shariah to create problems for the Obasanjo government,'' said Yahaya Mahmood, the lawyer for a Muslim organization in the north, ''either Muslims who have lost relevance in the north or Christians who are calling for sovereignty in the south.''</p>
        <p>Muslim leaders have politicized the Shariah, Mr. Mahmood said, while Christian leaders have used it to inspire fear among their followers and stoke separatist sentiments. Nigeria's desperate poverty, resulting from successive governments that have stolen the country's oil money, provided the ammunition.</p>
        <p>''If there were enough to eat, nobody would riot,'' Mr. Mahmood said. ''What we need is good government and sincere leadership.''</p>
        <p>Nigeria has been blessed with little of either. In the religiously mixed state of Kaduna, where thousands were killed in riots after the state's leaders said they were considering enacting the Shariah, Christians have gravitated to the south and Muslims to the north.</p>
        <p>''I heard this area was all Christian,'' said Simon Tyonongo, a new arrival to a neighborhood called Sabon Tasha. Mr. Tyonongo, a jobless 40-year-old who said he had lived until recently in a mixed northern neighborhood, sat recently by a roadside in front of two gutted houses. ''You see the Muslim houses there. They are all burned and they are no longer staying here. It's better here for me. I feel free.''</p>
        <p>The Shariah has long been in effect among Muslims in the northern states, as local religious leaders referred to it to decide on personal matters like marriage and inheritance. While governments played little role in its enforcement in the past, they are the ones pushing it forward today.</p>
        <p>Here in Gusau, the government of Zamfara has adopted policies that affect all areas of life: schools, transportation, hotels, restaurants and criminal matters. In the most famous case, a man who stole a cow was convicted in a Shariah court and had a hand cut off.</p>
        <p>''He confessed, so there was no doubt at all,'' said Mahmud Aliyu Shinkafi, the state's deputy governor, in an interview in his office here.</p>
        <p>Like all politicians who have moved toward Shariah, Mr. Shinkafi emphasized that the law would apply only to Muslims, never to the Christian minority living in Zamfara. This, he said, is not a move toward an Islamic state.</p>
        <p>And yet, just outside his office, construction workers were building a mosque with public money. A couple of miles away, in the compound of the deputy governor's official residence, workers were doing the same. The deputy governor's aides said they simply needed a place to pray.</p>
        <p>Under the Shariah, Mr. Shinkafi said, gambling, prostitution and crime have nearly vanished. ''We had no armed robbery for four months,'' he said, adding that robbers from neighboring Kaduna State had recently slipped into Zamfara to commit an offense. ''This is a success.''</p>
        <p>Interviews in Gusau suggested that most Muslims here shared his opinion.</p>
        <p>At the market, Abdulmmounu Muhammad, 35, was another trader who moved here after the Shariah was enacted. ''We're enjoying it -- we have peace,'' Mr. Muhammad said, explaining that in Kaduna, where he had lived previously, his business had suffered. ''There were armed robberies and stealing.''</p>
        <p>About the amputation of the cow thief's hand, he added: ''People were happy over it. The majority of the people here supported it.''</p>
        <p>At another market, traders said the Shariah had raised sales by raising morality.</p>
        <p>''Before, when men collected their salary they would spend it on prostitutes or beer,'' said Ahmed Salis, 27, who sells plastic containers. ''Now they come here with their wives and buy things for the family.'' His sales have at least doubled, he said.</p>
        <p>Another trader, Ibrahim Lawal, 25, said he himself had turned over a new leaf. ''This Shariah encouraged me to get married,'' Mr. Lawal said, adding that in another year or so he expected his 15-year-old wife to bear him a child.</p>
        <p>In the middle of town, Halima Mamman, 55, was walking along Gusau's biggest street with her 7-year-old grandson in tow. Mrs. Mamman moved from a village in the state to the capital here six months ago.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to come here to the headquarters of Shariah,'' she said. She strongly supported changes like forbidding women to ride on motorcycle taxis, called kabu-kabu.</p>
        <p>''The decision against kabu-kabu,'' she said, ''is in order for the simple reason that Islam forbids women from touching any man apart from her husband.''</p>
        <p>A few hundred feet away, a group of girls had been waiting for at least half an hour for a women-only taxi to pass by. The girls, students at the government's Girls Arabic Secondary School, covered their heads and faces with their shawls and hands. ''It has no effect on us,'' one of them said of the state's adoption of the Shariah.</p>
        <p>Moving around town has become even harder for Christian women. Forbidden to enter public taxis or buses -- or even women-only taxis unless they covered their heads -- they have relied mostly on Christian kabu-kabu drivers. But they are often difficult to find.</p>
        <p>''So we trek,'' explained Victorian Jonathan, a waitress. ''I want to leave. I don't like the state. It's not good for us.'' Many Christians have already left, not only from this state, but also from the others that have taken up the Koran, said officials in Abuja.</p>
        <p>''This thing has bedeviled us, particularly at this time of democracy,'' said Barminas Yilkes, 45, a congressman from Plateau State, which includes Jos, the city where many Christians have been moving. ''Really, the effect is bad. You cannot live in isolation and develop properly in a modern world.''</p>
        <p>The Muslim generals who ruled Nigeria for most of its postcolonial history understood the divisiveness of the Shariah. They had quickly suppressed calls for it in the past, viewing it as challenge to them and to national unity.</p>
        <p>Today, the Shariah seems to be weakening several of the policies undertaken to stitch Nigeria together after the Biafra war of 1967-70, in which a million people were killed when the largely Christian Ibo ethnic group in the southeast tried to secede.</p>
        <p>Since the 1970's university students have been required to spend their first year after graduation serving in an area of the country other than their own. In recent months, though, many Christian graduates have left the Shariah states, or simply refused to go there.</p>
        <p>''I will not allow my daughter to serve in the north,'' said Dorcas Odujinrin, a congresswoman from Lagos. ''It does not make sense to train her and then send her to the den of the lion.'' The Shariah, she added, ''is an infringement on the rights of women. It is an oppressive system against everybody, especially women.''</p>
