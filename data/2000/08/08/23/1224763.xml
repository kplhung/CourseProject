        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy has ordered the closing of 4 of New York City's worst-performing schools and the revamping of 12 others, finding that they have repeatedly failed to meet heightened statewide performance standards.</p>
        <p>The closings, one to take place immediately and three to occur over the coming school year, are the first under Mr. Levy, and come as Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, has stepped up  efforts to get the school board to improve  underperforming schools.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 1, Mr. Mills filed a lawsuit against Mr. Levy to block him from assigning uncertified teachers to the city's worst-performing schools, those that have repeatedly failed to meet performance standards and that have lingered on the state's list of ''schools under registration review.'' Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for today in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>All of the schools expected to be closed or revamped are on the state's list, and, in some cases, have been for as long as eight years. Although the schools are in various geographic school districts, most of them  are also part of the Chancellor's District, a special grouping of low-performing schools that was formed in 1996; these schools are under the authority of the chancellor rather than local school boards.</p>
        <p>The four schools to be closed -- two in Manhattan and two in the Bronx -- have all been involved, for two to three years, in an intensive improvement program that included longer school days, additional money and staff changes. In the end, however, the schools did not meet the revamped performance levels set by the state.</p>
        <p>The school buildings themselves will not be closed; they will be used for other educational purposes, like magnet schools.</p>
        <p>The 12 schools being restructured are at an earlier stage in improvement efforts:  education officials have spent the last year coming up with plans to replace at least half the staff at each school, devise new curriculums and provide more intensive instruction periods during and after school hours.</p>
        <p>Last year, Rudy Crew, the chancellor at the time, announced similar plans to close 13 low-performing schools, the largest such initiative in the Board of Education's recent history. Two of those schools have already been shuttered, and 11 will be closed by  June. Previously, Dr. Crew had closed a total of 24 schools.</p>
        <p>In the latest round, Intermediate School 74, in District 8 in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, will be closed immediately. Last year, only 17 percent of the students at the school, which houses grades five through eight, met the new, higher state standards on the English language arts test.</p>
        <p>The students who would have attended I.S. 74 -- about 270 children -- will be allowed to enroll in other District 8 middle schools, as long as the schools are not under the state's registration review. The I.S. 74 building will be occupied in the coming year by at least two schools, including a magnet school and an alternative high school.</p>
        <p>The other Bronx school to be closed, Primary School 104 in the South Bronx's District 9, for children from pre-kindergarten through the fifth grade, will be shut down at the end of the school year. This year, meanwhile, it will be limited to grades four and five, with younger children being offered enrollment in other District 9 elementary schools that are not under review.</p>
        <p>The two schools in Manhattan -- Junior High School 22, in District 1 on the Lower East Side, and I.S. 43, also known as the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Academy, in Harlem's District 5 -- also will be limited to smaller enrollments this year and will be closed in June 2001.</p>
        <p>In court papers filed in the state's lawsuit yesterday, lawyers for Mr. Mills, the education commissioner, painted a grim picture of 99 schools under registration review, most of which are in Brooklyn and the Bronx. The lawyers charged that the schools' biggest problem was a disproportionately large number of uncertified teachers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills is demanding that the city not only replace about 335 unlicensed teachers who were assigned to the 99 failing schools last year, but also fill any additional vacancies -- at least 150 are anticipated -- with certified teachers. Lawyers for Mr. Levy have argued that he cannot comply because the state has not trained or recruited enough certified teachers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mills's lawyers scoffed at that in their court papers, saying it was not the state's responsibility to recruit teachers for New York City. According to their brief, the city hired more than 10,000 certified teachers for the 1999-2000 school year but assigned only 15 percent of them to underperforming schools. The state lawyers said the city could easily solve the problem this fall by assigning as many newly hired certified teachers as necessary to the failing schools.</p>
        <p>''Compliance with the order will cause minimum disruption if the Board of Education uses its resources correctly,'' they wrote.</p>
        <p>The 12 schools that are scheduled for revamping were placed on the state's registration review list in 1997. Last November, Mr. Mills notified the Board of Education that those schools had not made sufficient progress in test scores and were in danger of being closed.</p>
        <p>Six of the 12 schools, including one high school, are in Brooklyn, while 3 are in the Bronx, 2 in Manhattan and one in Queens.</p>
        <p>They are, in Brooklyn, Public School/ I.S. 35 and P.S. 243 in District 16, P.S. 246 and Middle School 391 in District 17, I.S. 55 in District 23 and the Automotive High School; in the Bronx, P.S. 49 in District 7, P.S./M.S. 3 in District 10, and P.S. 214 in District 12; in Manhattan, P.S. 180 in District 3 and P.S. 129 in District 5; and in Queens, P.S. 111 in District 30.</p>
        <p>Under the review process, which was revamped in 1996 by Mr. Mills, those schools will have at least two additional years to demonstrate improvements in students' test scores. If they fail to improve, the commissioner can then take steps to revoke their right to operate.</p>
