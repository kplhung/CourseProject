        <p>The police last night were searching for the family of an unidentified  toddler found wandering alone in a Coney Island housing complex on Monday night.</p>
        <p>The girl, estimated to be 2 or 3, was found in the courtyard of the complex, Luna Park Houses, at 9 p.m., the police said. She was wearing white Reeboks and a sweatsuit stained with ice cream, they said.</p>
        <p>All the child said when questioned was, '' 'My mommy went to McDonald's,' '' Capt. Tim Horner of the Brooklyn Detective Bureau said yesterday at a news conference. He said the girl might have been abandoned.</p>
        <p>Ingrid Yulchevsky, 10, who visits her grandfather at Luna Park, said yesterday that on Monday night she and her baby sitter, Katie Blajro, 57,  saw the child following an overweight, middle-aged woman with dark shoulder-length hair and wearing a red sweatshirt and pants.</p>
        <p>The woman held the child's hand for a second before walking off, with the child following, they said.</p>
        <p>The girl, who the police said might be named Kristen, was later found by a Luna Park resident and taken to a security guard, Willie Maye. No one seemed to know her, he said, and he did not think she lived there.</p>
        <p>The child was in the custody of the Administration for Children's Services. The police asked anyone with information to call (718) 946-3353.</p>
