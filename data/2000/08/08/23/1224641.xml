        <p>WHEN it comes to fish, geography seems to dictate consumer tastes. New York's markets and menus are dominated by oceangoing varieties, not fish that spend their lives in rivers and lakes. In Chicago and other Great Lakes cities, freshwater fish are more in favor.</p>
        <p>But this summer, several European-trained chefs here have been delighted to discover walleye from the Great Lakes. The fish is extremely meaty, with firm snowy flesh of uncommonly satiny succulence and a sweet, mild flavor.</p>
        <p>And for one of these chefs, Laurent Tourondel of Cello, on the Upper East Side, it has been a reunion of sorts.</p>
        <p>''When I was at Troisgros, in France, we would get sandre from the Loire, and I didn't think it was available here,'' he said. ''But your walleye pike is the same. It's a wonderful, big, firm-textured fish.''</p>
        <p>Kurt Gutenbrunner, the chef and owner of the new Wallse in Greenwich Village, named for his hometown in Austria, is also serving the fish, which is called zander in German. He calls it yellow pike on his menu, which is another common name.</p>
        <p>Laurent Gras at Peacock Alley in the Waldorf-Astoria and Daniel Boulud at Daniel are also using walleye now. Jean-Georges Vongerichten, though, says he has been familiar with it for several years but does not have it on the menu regularly because supplies are not guaranteed. He offers it as a special, often poached in butter with a caramelized shallot broth.</p>
        <p>Walleye is actually not a member of the pike family at all but is related to perch. Pike-perch is another of its confusing aliases, which explains why the translation of the French sandre is sometimes given as both pike and perch.</p>
        <p>In Michigan, walleye is also known as pickerel. In the northern Midwest, it's popular at fish fries.</p>
        <p>In New York, walleye is often sold as yellow pike, which is one of the classic ingredients of gefilte fish.</p>
        <p>Walleye range in size from about 5 to 10 pounds and have a shape like salmon but with a fierce-looking jaw. They rarely have the slightly muddy taste typical of some freshwater fish.</p>
        <p>The name walleye refers to its wide-set eyes, which, because it forages at night, never have the clarity and brightness characteristic of the freshest fish.</p>
        <p>Walleye can be found in rivers and lakes from New York to Montana, as far north as Hudson's Bay in Canada and as far south as North Carolina. In 1812, walleye were introduced into a branch of the Susquehanna River near Elmira, N.Y., and they thrived so abundantly throughout the Middle Atlantic river system they were called Susquehanna salmon. But they were highly prized on the plate, and by the end of the 19th century had been overfished in this region nearly to extinction.</p>
        <p>Almost all the walleye on the market come from the Great Lakes, especially Lake Erie. They are available fresh in markets here from spring through early fall. During the rest of the year, they are usually available frozen, though sometimes fresh walleye shows up in the market.</p>
        <p>Citarella on the Upper West and Upper East Sides sells the whole fish for $5.95 a pound. Jake's Fish Market on the Upper West Side has it for $6.99 a pound. Wild Edibles in the Grand Central Market is selling fillets for $13.95 a pound.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tourondel of Cello sears the fillets and serves them with a red-wine butter sauce, often on a bed of Swiss chard stems. ''That's the classic way it's done in Burgundy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>SEARED WALLEYE WITH MERLOT SAUCE  Adapted from Cello  Time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>4 cups merlot  10 finely chopped shallots  Pinch sugar  3 sprigs thyme  5 cloves garlic: 1 whole, 1 minced, 3 crushed  1 bay leaf  4 black peppercorns, crushed  Stems from 2 large bunches red Swiss chard  4 ounces slab bacon in  1/2-inch dice  10 tablespoons unsalted butter in  1/2-inch dice  1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 1/2 pounds walleye fillet, in six portions, with skin.</p>
        <p>1. Place merlot in saucepan with shallots, sugar, 1 sprig thyme, whole garlic clove, bay leaf and crushed peppercorns. Cook over medium heat until wine has nearly evaporated but shallots are soft and moist but not brown. Set aside in saucepan.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, trim Swiss chard stems in 3-inch lengths. (Reserve leaves for another purpose.) Bring large pot of salted water to a boil, add stems and blanch 2 minutes, until tender. Drain and place in ice water.</p>
        <p>3. Heat large skillet, and add bacon. Fry until crisp. Drain excess fat, and remove bacon. Add 2 tablespoons butter. When butter starts to brown, add minced garlic. Drain and add Swiss chard. Stir-fry a couple of minutes, return bacon to pan and stir in parsley. Set aside.</p>
        <p>4. Remove garlic, thyme and bay leaf from the saucepan that contains the wine and shallots. Place pan over medium heat. Whisk in 6 tablespoons butter bit by bit, until smooth. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</p>
        <p>5. Lightly score skin of fish. Season with salt and pepper. Heat remaining butter in large cast-iron pan. Add remaining garlic and thyme. When butter starts to brown, add fish, skin side down, and sear until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn, and sear until done, another 5 minutes or so.</p>
        <p>6. Reheat Swiss chard mixture, and place a portion in center of each of 6 plates. Place fish, skin side up, on top. Gently reheat sauce and spoon around the fish, then serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
