        <p>Trailing by 6-7, 1-3, in the second set of his match against Stefan Koubek, Patrick Rafter suddenly realized that he might be leaving the Hamlet Cup in Commack, N.Y. -- and heading into the United States Open -- with just one match.</p>
        <p>''I thought, 'Oh, no,' '' said Rafter, continuing his comeback from shoulder surgery last October. ''I thought I had to hang tough.''</p>
        <p>Rafter, who won the Hamlet Cup two years ago en route to his second Open title, proceeded to do just that. Rafter, seeded seventh here, earned a hard-fought 6-7 (3), 7-5, 7-6 (8) victory over the 23-year-old Austrian, ranked No. 42 in the world.</p>
        <p>''I haven't had the matches I've played in the past going into the Open,'' said Rafter, who had not played since reaching the quarterfinals in Toronto in early August, when he suffered shoulder pain. ''Tonight, the shoulder felt great. This is a good test for me -- if it can't withstand a three-setter, it's not going to withstand a five-setter.''</p>
        <p>Rafter broke when Koubek served for the match and and then broke him again to take the second set.</p>
        <p>Going serve for serve, the two headed to the inevitable tie breaker in the third set. Rafter fell behind by 3-5 but then fought off three match points and went ahead for the first time, 9-8, on a cross-court volley winner on Koubek's serve. Koubek then netted a backhand to end the match.</p>
