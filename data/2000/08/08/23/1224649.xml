        <p>The conductor Philippe Herreweghe has become an industrious presence in the early-music world over the last few decades, having established and made recordings with a handful of ensembles, each of which explores a different historical corner of the repertory. But when he made his Mostly Mozart debut on Sunday afternoon at Alice Tully Hall, it was with the first of his groups, the Collegium Vocale, which he founded in Ghent, Belgium, in 1970.</p>
        <p>Lincoln Center billed the Collegium Vocale's performances (the choir and period instrument orchestra performed another program on Monday evening) as its United States debut, but the choir performed at Carnegie Hall in 1994.</p>
        <p>The Collegium first appeared on the early music world's radar screens in the mid-1970's, when it participated in the complete Bach cantata series then being recorded by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Gustav Leonhardt. Since then the group and Mr. Herreweghe have recorded plentifully, but with the 250th anniversary of Bach's death being commemorated this season, it seemed natural for the choir to return to its Bachian roots on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The first half of its all-Bach program was devoted to a pair of cantatas that hint at the range of expression the works embody. The Cantata No. 11, ''Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen,'' composed for the Feast of the Ascension in 1735, or actually, assembled then, since Bach composed some of its music much earlier. Most notably, the aria ''Ach bleibe doch, mein liebstes Leben'' is based on a movement from a wedding serenade that Bach had written a decade earlier, and he would use it again, most famously, as the Agnus Dei of the Mass in B minor nearly 15 years later.</p>
        <p>As a work composed for a feast day, the cantata begins and ends with celebratory flourishes of trumpets, percussion, organ and bright choral textures. Yet its heart is a series of more introspective recitatives and arias that lean in the direction of the Passions. As in the Passions, an Evangelist provides the narrative structure in quotations from the New Testament, and the subject is Jesus' ascension into heaven.</p>
        <p>The Cantata No. 105, ''Herr, gehe nicht ins Gericht,'' composed for a regular Sunday service, is a shorter, more modest work, with opening and closing chorales surrounding arias that are devotional rather than dramatic. It is a somewhat more gratifying work for the tenor, who has a lovely, challenging aria just before the final chorale.</p>
        <p>In both cantatas, and in a sublime account of the Magnificat after the intermission, Mr. Herreweghe took leisurely tempos that kept the spotlight on the natural ease of Bach's text setting. The sound he drew from his 22-voice mixed choir was lush, flexible and beautifully unified, and it was supported by an expert period instrument band. Particularly enlivening were Marcel Ponseele's gracefully winding solo oboe lines, Patrick Beuckels's flute playing and the well-tuned contributions of the trumpet section in both Cantata No. 11 and the Magnificat.</p>
        <p>There was some distinguished solo singing as well. The countertenor Andreas Scholl gave beautifully nuanced accounts of the solo alto lines, and Deborah York brought an appealing combination of vulnerability and assurance to the soprano arias. Scot Weir, a tenor, and Sebastian Noack, a bass, both last-minute substitutes for singers who were ill, sang with warmth and solidity.</p>
