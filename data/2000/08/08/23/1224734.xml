        <p>The federal government's case for refusing bail to Wen Ho Lee, the former Los Alamos scientist accused of improperly downloading and copying classified nuclear weapons data, has been seriously weakened by revelations that the Federal Bureau of Investigation's lead agent in the case provided misleading testimony in two separate bail hearings last December.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee's guilt or innocence will ultimately be determined at trial. But given the government's misrepresentations and new evidence suggesting that the case against him is weaker than first thought, fairness demands that he be granted bail while he awaits trial. Because of the gravity of the charges, he should continue to be kept under strict surveillance, with monitoring devices and any trips from his home approved by the court.</p>
        <p>Since his arrest last December, Mr. Lee has been held in solitary confinement and even in shackles because the government contends he poses an extraordinary threat to national security. This picture was created in part by the testimony of Robert Messemer, the lead F.B.I. agent, indicating that Mr. Lee engaged in deliberate deception when he downloaded classified information onto computer tapes, seven of which are now missing.</p>
        <p>Last week Mr. Messemer admitted in court that his previous statements under oath were incorrect. He originally said Mr. Lee had told another scientist at Los Alamos that he wanted to borrow his computer to download a resume. But in F.B.I. interviews and grand jury testimony the colleague  did not mention a resume, and said Mr. Lee had only said that he wanted to download ''some files.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Messemer had also testified that Mr. Lee did not disclose contacts he made with Chinese scientists during an approved trip to Beijing in 1986. But in fact, Mr. Lee filed a report on those contacts after the trip. In addition, Mr. Messemer said last December that Mr. Lee had sent letters to several overseas institutions seeking employment. The government apparently is now operating under the theory that one of Mr. Lee's motives for downloading data was to impress potential employers. But Mr. Messemer admitted this week that while letters were found on Mr. Lee's home computer, there is no evidence they had been sent or received.</p>
        <p>Mr. Messemer's erroneous statements are not the only troubling aspect of the government's case. The government has insisted that the data Mr. Lee downloaded were the ''crown jewels'' of the nuclear defense system and argues that Mr. Lee must be kept in prison because he might transfer nuclear secrets to China or other countries. Yet John Richter, a former top nuclear weapons designer at Los Alamos, and Harold Agnew, former director of Los Alamos, have said that the downloaded data would not be useful to a foreign power, and that much of the information is already in the public record. Mr. Lee has indicated that he was making backup copies of the data, and that his actions were in line with his job.</p>
        <p>The trial, scheduled for November, will be the arena to examine the full case against Mr. Lee. The F.B.I.'s misstatements to the court, however, cast troubling doubt on the integrity of the investigation.</p>
