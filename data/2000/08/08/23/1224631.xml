        <p>More Blue Ribbons</p>
        <p>Bruce and Eric Bromberg, whose little empire of Blue Ribbon restaurants (one with a bakery) is in the West Village and SoHo, are branching out to Park Slope, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Their new restaurant at 280 Fifth Avenue (First Street), which is to open next year, will incorporate the Blue Ribbon hallmarks: laid-back style and raw-bar splendor.</p>

        <p>More Blue Ribbons</p>
        <p>Bruce and Eric Bromberg, whose little empire of Blue Ribbon restaurants (one with a bakery) is in the West Village and SoHo, are branching out to Park Slope, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Their new restaurant at 280 Fifth Avenue (First Street), which is to open next year, will incorporate the Blue Ribbon hallmarks: laid-back style and raw-bar splendor.</p>
        <p>Multiple Personalities</p>
        <p>A Latin beat heats up the flavors at a sprawling place that has opened at 327 West 44th Street. There's a restaurant, Babalu, with food by Alex Garcia of Calle Ocho. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday it turns into a nightclub with a tapas menu. The space also houses Blue Angel, a big supper club that opens this Friday. Dinner will be served there at 6 p.m., and at 8 there's a show called ''Four Guys Named Jose.'' After 10, it becomes a nightclub, too.</p>
        <p>A Lofty Bonus</p>
        <p>Lex 303, in the Shelburne Murray Hill Hotel, is a ground-floor restaurant with a surprise -- an open-air bar on the roof (above), a 16th-floor aerie with spectacular views, with drinks and light food after 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>The restaurant, which opened in late spring in the hotel, at 303 Lexington Avenue (37th Street), has a bar of its own, and it is now featuring a crab fest for $16.95.</p>
        <p>Shifting Pastry Chefs</p>
        <p>Bill Yosses, the pastry chef at Bouley Bakery, has left to create pastries for the Citarella stores. Later in the fall, he will become the executive pastry chef for the Citarella restaurant opening in Rockefeller Center.  Marc Aumont has come from Tours, France, to replace him at the retail bakery, with Oscar Palacios, formerly at Cello, in the restaurant.</p>
