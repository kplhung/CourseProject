        <p>The German widow of an African killed by neo-Nazis broke down today after about an hour spent silently facing the three young men accused of his murder on the opening day of their trial.</p>
        <p>The widow, Angelika Adriano, 43, was ushered from the courtroom in distress after sitting opposite the generally impassive men and hearing a prosecutor charge that they ''assumed that Alberto Adriano could die from their attack, but their hatred of foreigners made them indifferent.''</p>
        <p>The killing of Mr. Adriano, a 39-year-old Mozambican, in the eastern town of Dessau has become a powerful symbol of the virulence of rightist, anti-immigrant sentiment, particularly among youths in the former East Germany, which has twice the unemployment of the country's west.</p>
        <p>As a result, the trial has assumed a particular political importance. Germany's chief prosecutor, Kay Nehm, who usually handles terrorism cases, has taken a leading role, and today Manfred Puchel, interior minister of the state of Saxony Anhalt, took the unusual step of issuing a statement calling for severe punishment.</p>
        <p>''Without wishing to put the independence of the judiciary into question, the culprits must feel the full force of the law,'' Mr. Puchel said, describing the killing as a ''sad and repugnant example of what xenophobic views can lead to.''</p>
        <p>Christian Richter and Frank Miethbauer, both 16, and Enrico Hilprecht, 24, have been charged with the murder of Mr. Adriano, a meatpacker who had been in Germany for 12 years. They have admitted attacking him on June 11 and leaving his body in the city park. He died three days later.</p>
        <p>Because of its Nazi past, and an important postwar commitment to providing asylum for anyone threatened because of race or beliefs, Germany is particularly sensitive to anti-immigrant violence.</p>
        <p>As a result, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has come under pressure to stop racist provocation and murder. The issue has abruptly cast a cloud over an administration that had appeared serene, with the opposition Christian Democrats in disarray and economic reforms giving business a lift.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroder embarked this week on a 10-day tour of the east, urging ''civic courage against rightist extremism.'' But his visit, after almost two years in office, is widely viewed as belated, and the weekly Der Spiegel mockingly portrayed the chancellor on its cover setting out in a safari hat for the unknown desert around Berlin.</p>
        <p>A decade after unification, the formerly Communist part of Germany still bears deep scars that more than $400 billion in federal investments has been unable to heal. Mr. Schroder, having promised to be the chancellor who made German unity more concrete, appears to have realized that his vow looks empty for now.</p>
        <p>In 1998, a sharp swing away from the Christian Democrats that partly benefited the Social Democrats helped Mr. Schroder get elected. With one-fifth of the German population, the east has the power to damage his prospects in the next federal election in 2002 if nothing changes.</p>
        <p>The tour has something of the air of a publicity stunt, but Mr. Schroder has proved shrewd in gauging the mood of Germans, and his demonstration of concern may bear fruit. He also knows that more racist violence could cause serious international damage to Germany's image.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Schroder sees himself as the head of a corporation called Germany that is competing internationally for the best minds,'' Tageszeitung commented. ''The problem is that certain of those best minds can only enter the eastern door of the corporation at high personal risk.''</p>
        <p>That risk was on display in court today in the form of three T-shirted young men from the Dessau region, where the collapse of the East German chemical industry has pushed unemployment over 20 percent. They showed no sign of remorse for the killing, although Mr. Richter appeared ill at ease and occasionally smiled awkwardly.</p>
        <p>''All three showed absolutely no contrition,'' said Ronald Reimann, a lawyer representing Mrs. Adriano. ''That was so shocking to me and my client that she had to leave the courtroom early.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Adriano, dressed in black, declined to comment as she walked out shortly after the judge ruled that the press and public, who had initially been admitted, should be barred from the court because two minors are involved.</p>
        <p>Under Germany's juvenile law, Mr. Richter and Mr. Miethbauer face a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment. Mr. Hilprecht could be imprisoned for life. The death sentence does not exist in Germany.</p>
