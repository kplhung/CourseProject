        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin promised the grieving families of the 118-member crew of the destroyed nuclear submarine Kursk tonight that the government would pay each family the equivalent of an officer's salary for 10 years to compensate them for their loss, Russian state television reported.</p>
        <p>In what appeared to be a closely controlled video account of Mr. Putin's first journey to the northern submarine base from which the twin-reactor submarine made its final voyage two weeks ago, Mr. Putin also met with Irina Lyachin, the widow of the Kursk's skipper, Capt. Gennadi Lyachin, his daughter, Dasha, and unidentified relatives in the captain's apartment in Vidyayevo. No audio account of the conversations was broadcast, and Mrs. Lyachin sat upright and attentive on a couch with her daughter at her side as Mr. Putin was shown speaking to her.</p>
        <p>Emerging from the apartment with Mrs. Lyachin, Mr. Putin motioned with his hand to a state television crew to stop filming as he descended the grimy stairwell in the apartment building that houses Russian officers and their families, at times without adequate heat and hot water supplies. Some reports said there were frantic efforts to clean the town before Mr. Putin's arrival.</p>
        <p>''Vidyayevo is a dead town right now,'' one young woman told state television earlier in the day. ''The houses are standing like after a war. All of the windows are empty. Everything is robbed. The mothers are walking like shadows through the town. People are crying and the men don't raise their eyes.''</p>
        <p>Before he left Moscow, Mr. Putin declared that Wednesday would be a national day of mourning and ordered flags to fly at half staff. Russian officials said he would fly to the deck of the cruiser Peter the Great to cast a memorial wreath of flowers onto the Arctic waters where the twin-reactor submarine went down on Aug. 12 after suffering a catastrophic series of internal explosions or possible collision.</p>
        <p>News media reports said tonight that family members had asked the Russian Navy to take them to sea so that they could also participate in the  memorial service on Wednesday and pay respects to their loved ones, but navy commanders were reportedly resisting that appeal.</p>
        <p>Also tonight, Mr. Putin attended a two-hour session at a meeting hall in Vidyayevo, the Kursk's home base near Severomorsk, the headquarters of the Northern Fleet. Both cities are closed to foreigners, and one Russian news organization, the independent network NTV, said its permit to enter the city had been rescinded, presumably to prevent its correspondents from covering Mr. Putin's visit.</p>
        <p>From the video accounts on state television, Mr. Putin's exchanges with family members were indistinct. ''When will we get them back, dead or alive?'' one woman was heard to shout.</p>
        <p>''I will answer as soon as I know myself,'' Mr. Putin was heard to respond.</p>
        <p>The Russian leader, dressed in black, arrived on a military plane in late afternoon and was greeted by top military officials, as well naval commanders and Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who is heading the investigation into the causes of the explosions or collision that sank the 14,000-ton submarine.</p>
        <p>The encounters with family members represent the most delicate and politically volatile task Mr. Putin faces in dampening the political crisis that has arisen over the loss of the advanced attack submarine and its crew. Many family members have questioned why the Russian government and its military commanders were not able to assure the safety of their loved ones and why the navy could not rescue them when tragedy struck.</p>
        <p>In interviews with state television earlier in the day, the wives of some Kursk sailors pleaded for international donations to continue the rescue operation in hopes that even one might still be found alive.</p>
        <p>''We were told that the Norwegian rescuers can't keep working because they are not being paid enough money,'' an unidentified woman said. ''Maybe some companies, some big people, philanthropists, will help us by giving money and maybe in 48 hours we'll save these people, and happiness will come, at least one person will come out of this submarine alive and will tell the truth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin did not travel to Severomorsk with his usual contingent of Russian news organizations, reflecting the concern of his advisers who were afraid that emotional outbursts and recriminations directed at Mr. Putin and broadcast to the nation might prolong the crisis and perhaps threaten the agenda of economic and political reforms he is said to be planning for the fall.</p>
        <p>Hours before Mr. Putin arrived by military plane in the region where dozens of secret submarine bases are located along the fjords of the Kola Peninsula, Norwegian and British deep-sea divers abandoned their search-and-rescue work. The crew's bodies remain in the Kursk's wrecked and flooded hull under 350 feet of water, but the Norwegians and British said they might be back with other equipment if they can conclude a contract with Russian officials. That contract would cover the cost of penetrating the hull in a complex operation to recover the remains of the sailors.</p>
        <p>Russian Navy officials offered to cut giant holes in the hull of the Kursk in order to make entry to the vessel easier and safer for divers involved in the recovery.</p>
        <p>Deputy Prime Minister Aleksei Kudrin said the Russian government was prepared to finance the full cost of the crew recovery and a complex and dangerous salvage operation whose estimated cost has already reached $100 million.</p>
        <p>Also today, environmental organizations urged Russia to move quickly to salvage the Kursk's two atomic reactors because of the threat that radiation could leak into the Barents Sea and its abundant fishing grounds. Experts in both the American and Russian Navies asserted that the Kursk's reactor compartment would adequately contain any radiation leaks for years, but Aleksandr Nikitin, a former Russian naval officer who disclosed the dumping of radioactive wastes at sea by the Russian Navy, warned on Monday that the Kursk's reactors could begin leaking radiation within weeks.</p>
        <p>With winter approaching in the Arctic waters, there were conflicting estimates of whether Russia would be able to recover the crew's remains and finish the salvage this fall, before fierce storms and ice flows set in.</p>
        <p>The effort to solve the mystery of how the Kursk sank also continued today. Aleksandr Rutskoi, former vice president and now governor of the Kursk region, for which the submarine is named, asserted today that the attack boat was carrying an experimental torpedo that was to be test-fired during the maneuvers in which the Kursk was operating.</p>
        <p>The Kursk had on board a ''new torpedo and two civilian engineers,'' said Mr. Rutskoi, a former war hero and leader of a 1993 parliamentary uprising against former President Boris N. Yeltsin, said. ''It is necessary to investigate this aspect, and if a new torpedo was really being tested on the submarine, it is a crime,'' he said, arguing that test-firings of new weapons should not be conducting during training exercises.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the Chechen rebellion in southern Russia offered their own explanation today, suggesting that a kamikaze fighter from the Northern Caucasus was among the crew and caused the disaster.</p>
