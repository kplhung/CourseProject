        <p>In the city that considers itself the cheesecake capital, selling cakes from Jackson, Miss., of all places, is a bold move. But that's what Jan Boscarino, above, is doing at her shop, Martha Frances Mississippi Cheesecakes, 1707 Second Avenue (88th Street).</p>
        <p>These indulgences are creamier than the typical New York version -- closer to Sara Lee's than Junior's -- and come in more than a dozen flavors, like caramel crunch, Turtle (as in the caramel, nut and chocolate candies known as Turtles), Black Forest and, of course, Mississippi mud. The fresh peach and the praline are particular winners. All are $4 a slice, $22 for a seven-inch cake or $40 for a nine-inch.</p>

        <p>The little shop is named for Ms. Boscarino's mother, whose recipes are used for the buttery caramel-topped poundcake, Key lime pie and custardy Southern plantation pie with chocolate chips and coconut.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Boscarino had to stop lacing her iced tea with sugar to satisfy New York tastes, she has experienced no Northern objection to her Southern-style cakes -- proving, perhaps, that for desserts at least, the sweet tooth owes no allegiance to geography.</p>
