        <p>For the fourth straight time, Venus Williams defeated Yelena Likhovtseva by 6-3, 7-5, tonight to advance to the Pilot Pen quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>This afternoon at the Connecticut Tennis Center, second-seeded Monica Seles also reached the quarterfinals by defeating Kristina Brandi, 6-2, 6-3.</p>
        <p>Likhovtseva is ranked 23rd and beat Venus's sister Serena in the Round of 16 at this year's Australian Open. But the 24-year-old Russian has not been able to beat Venus Williams. Recently, no one has.</p>
        <p>Because of tendinitis in both wrists, Williams missed the first five months of competition this year. But she has won her last three events, including Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>But the top-seeded Williams was in far from top form tonight. After breaking the Russian's service five times in a row en route to opening up a 3-0 lead in the second set, Williams had to fight off four set points in the 10th game, which went to nine deuces before she held serve.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I was as intense as I should have been,'' Williams said.</p>
        <p>Seles's 98 mile-an-hour ace closed out her victory, but it was the zip on her pinpoint groundstrokes that kept Brandi on her heels.</p>
        <p>''I missed some shots because of my timing,'' the 26-year-old Seles said. ''And my arm felt very good.''</p>
        <p>That would be her left arm, which she strained several weeks ago while favoring blisters on her left hand.</p>
