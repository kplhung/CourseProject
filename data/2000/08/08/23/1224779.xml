        <p>The word of the day was ''preparatory.''</p>
        <p>As in, Bronx Preparatory Charter School, the name stitched in blue and gold on the patches decorating the children's white polo shirts. As in, ''Preparation + Focus = Success,'' the motto posted on the wall in the cafeteria, in the hallway, at the front of every classroom and at the bottom of teachers' letters to parents.</p>
        <p>''The mission, the reason, the be-all and end-all of why we are here, is to prepare you for college -- and for life,'' Kristin Kearns Jordan told the 100 black and Hispanic youngsters seated around the tables that she and her husband had spent the previous Saturday putting together. ''Everything that happens here happens to help get you prepared. But you're never going to be prepared if you don't do the work.''</p>
        <p>''Is that crystal?'' Ms. Jordan asked, employing one of the gimmicks the children had learned minutes before.</p>
        <p>''Clear!'' they shouted in unison.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jordan, 31, had been preparing for this moment for 18 months, or maybe for her entire life, but especially throughout this summer of 14-hour workdays filled with assembling computer tables, negotiating staff contracts, collating student binders and soothing parental worries. And finally, last Wednesday, it was the first hour of the first day of the first year of a new school.</p>
        <p>While most political debate over education involves tweaking existing programs, charter schools present a chance for teachers, parents, management companies and bright young idealists like Ms. Jordan, who had never before worked in a school, to sit around a blank blackboard and imagine a school from scratch.</p>
        <p>Charter schools, which get public funds but are run without regulation from the local school district, have been embraced by conservatives and liberals alike as an outlet for innovation, what many see as the most dynamic and important education reform movement in decades.</p>
        <p>Bronx Prep started with 102 fifth and sixth graders -- and seven teachers -- three weeks before almost every other New York City public school, part of its regimen of extra class time and rigorous discipline. With plans to add a grade each year until it stretches through high school, Bronx Prep is one of 380  charter schools opening across the country this fall, including 18 in New York State, 11 of them in New York City. A movement that began with three schools in Minnesota and California in 1992 now stretches across 34 states and the District of Columbia, with nearly 520,000 students -- 1 percent of the nation's schoolchildren -- enrolled in 2,069 schools.</p>
        <p>Though more than two-thirds of the schools have waiting lists and some have posted remarkable achievement gains, the freedom granted to charter schools has also created opportunities for corruption, with some schools shuttered after officials discovered dangerous facilities, the illegal teaching of religion or financial irregularities. Over all, 79 new charter schools have closed.</p>
        <p>As Bronx Prep begins its first year, promising to prepare students for the nation's top colleges through a tightly controlled environment and an extended school day and year, the looming question is whether independence and innovation can transcend the problems plaguing children from one of the nation's poorest and most troubled neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>''The question yesterday was, will we be able to pull it off? The question today is, how good can we get?'' Ms. Jordan said last week, on Day 2. ''Everyone can perform for the first day. Now our challenge is to sustain it and build it and make it work.''</p>
        <p>By Lottery and by Design</p>
        <p>On a sweaty Saturday morning in May, a dozen adults seated around a classroom badly in need of paint raised their hands with questions, children squirming by their sides. Will there be music lessons? When will Spanish classes begin? Who will teach special education? What about gym?</p>
        <p>The answers were all the same: We don't know.</p>
        <p>''It's in the works,'' said Marina Bernard Damiba, 29, the teacher whom Ms. Jordan, the school's director, had hired to be the principal. ''I don't want to make promises.''</p>
        <p>Even a seat in the new school was not guaranteed, because New York's charter law, passed in 1998, dictates that enrollment be determined by lottery. Technically, the school is open to any student in the state, but Bronx Prep's 155 applications came from within a few miles of the school, where recruiting was focused.</p>
        <p>Charter schools cannot hand-pick high-quality students, but the fact that their families sought out the school suggests a certain commitment to education. (By opening day, Ms. Jordan remained unclear about how many of her students needed special education or English as a second language services, because none of their former schools had handed over their records.)</p>
        <p>Many of those who turned up for the 10 information sessions this spring had once applied to the School Choice Scholarship Foundation, an organization Ms. Jordan used to run that sends low-income students to private schools. Some of the children were bright and unchallenged in the local schools. Others had behavior problems, lagging years behind grade level. A few parents were lured by Bronx Prep's promised schedule: 7:55 a.m. to 5 p.m., 200 days a year, or some 50 percent more time in class than the Board of Education requires.</p>
        <p>''I'm just going so I can please my mother,'' shrugged Shyann Sellers, 10, who is in fifth grade this fall. ''She's going to force me to go.''</p>
        <p>''I know what's best,'' intoned Brenda Sellers, her mother, a school crossing guard.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to come here in August and all my friends will be playing,'' Shyann whined.</p>
        <p>''Not the ones,'' Ms. Sellers said, ''that want to be smart.''</p>
        <p>A 'Moral Obligation'</p>
        <p>Bronx Prep was born out of frustration with the educational desert that dominates the South Bronx, combined with Ms. Jordan's yearning to work more closely with children after years in nonprofit educational organizations.</p>
        <p>By March 1999 -- more than a year before the charter would be formally issued -- Ms. Jordan had told her bosses at the School Choice Scholarship Foundation that she planned to open a school; the name popped into her head one night that month as she lay in bed, she said. Unlike most charter-school operators, for whom obtaining facilities is the biggest challenge, Ms. Jordan quickly secured a $75,000-a-year lease -- cheap at $5.75 a square foot -- from Our Lady of Victory, a Roman Catholic church, for the school next door, which was vacant for five years.</p>
        <p>Situated in a desolate stretch of grimy bodegas and empty lots in the Morrisania section, Bronx Prep is surrounded in District 9, which posted the lowest reading and math scores of New York's 32 school districts on citywide tests in 1999. Four of the nine middle schools in the district are on the state's watch list of failing schools; only 16.6 percent of its fourth graders met the state's reading standards in 1999.</p>
        <p>In her application, Ms. Jordan described a ''moral obligation to offer young people in the community an alternative.'' Nationally, one out of five charter schools is aimed at helping low-income and minority students.</p>
        <p>Initial approval from the State University of New York came in January, and a month later, Ms. Jordan had hired Mrs. Damiba, a Haitian-born dynamo who was one of the founding teachers at KIPP Academy, a school a few miles away that has received national attention for outstanding performance.</p>
        <p>''At Bronx Prep, we believe,'' Mrs. Damiba said dramatically at a teacher job fair in June. ''We believe that children in the Bronx, if given the opportunity, will want to and can perform at the highest academic levels.''</p>
        <p>As a charter school, Bronx Prep can ignore city and state mandates regarding curriculum, testing, staffing and spending, though it has promised to administer the same standardized tests as the New York City Board of Education so that its progress can be compared with its competitors. The school is also held accountable for lengthy standards described in the charter, which SUNY can renew or revoke after five years.</p>
        <p>Bronx Prep lays out a lofty mission: to produce graduates who ''think critically and creatively,'' with strong skills in core subjects, technology and the arts, and ''are committed to a lifetime of learning and civic involvement.'' The expectation is admission to the nation's top high schools and colleges, like Ms. Jordan's alma maters, Phillips Exeter Academy and Brown University.</p>
        <p>Tidbits like the word of the day, the hand-rung bell to signal class switches, and the achievement agreement all students, parents and teachers must sign are borrowed from Exeter, Catholic schools, other charter schools, and, especially, from KIPP, the Knowledge Is Power Program, which itself is converting this fall from a branch of the Board of Education to a charter school.</p>
        <p>Bronx Prep has daily 90-minute blocks of reading and math, plus separate classes in grammar/writing and novel reading, along with science and social studies. The afternoons are devoted to ''enrichment'' -- 42 students are in the orchestra, the rest are split among African dance and drumming, step dancing and chess. Each teacher also meets daily with a small group of students for discussions and activities like community service; plans for recess and physical education remain sketchy.</p>
        <p>It is to be a place of rigid discipline, filled with rituals, where students are called ''scholars,'' drilled in basic skills and nitpicked about decorum -- girls endlessly reminded to close legs under the plaid uniform skirts, boys admonished to keep hands out of the pockets of their khakis. Over and over again, students are told to ''practice their Steps'': S means sit up straight; T, track the speaker; E, enrich the class; P, pay attention; and S, show you understand.</p>
        <p>During the first day's lunch, a half-hour passed before students unwrapped their sandwiches. First, they had to form straight, silent lines to parade down three flights of stairs, where they were shown to their assigned cafeteria seats. Then there was a lecture on appropriate voice levels at lunch, and much practicing of standing and sitting in unison.</p>
        <p>''Several times Ms. Jordan asked for silence, and several times you spoke,'' Mrs. Damiba hissed at the sixth-grade tables as the fifth graders marched to fetch their food. ''So for lunchtime today, you're silent. Our directions will be followed the first time they are given.''</p>
        <p>Later, washing down the tables, Ms. Jordan said: ''Once you lose control, it's a spiral. You establish the control at the beginning. You can always loosen it up.''</p>
        <p>Savvy and a Thick Rolodex</p>
        <p>Ms. Jordan has never taught a class. She has not designed a curriculum. She has no degree in education, no teaching certificate, little hands-on experience with children.</p>
        <p>What she has is a thick Rolodex, with relationships in the world of education and the Bronx community, organizational savvy and newly discovered skills like shopping for industrial-size food warmers on the Bowery, operating a power drill and sewing curtains for the doorless women's bathroom.</p>
        <p>She also knows how to raise money: nearly $900,000 to date, much of it before the charter was even granted, from foundations, corporations and  friends. Expenses for the first year are estimated at $1.1 million, plus $400,000 in pre-opening costs. The state's per-pupil allocation of $6,630 adds up to $676,000, with other revenues of $150,000 in federal and state startup grants; $125,000 in aid for programs for poor students; and $8,000 from the state for materials.</p>
        <p>''We've raised more money than we need,'' she announced at the June board meeting in her Astor Place apartment. ''I'm going to continue to fund-raise, frankly. It doesn't make sense not to, with the momentum of a new school. We don't want to create a great program that we can't sustain.''</p>
        <p>Critics question whether it is fair to compare schools that receive such private support with neighborhood schools relying solely on government funds. Charter school advocates complain that they typically get only about 90 percent of the funds of a traditional school, and face added costs, particularly for buildings.</p>
        <p>Bronx Prep's current home is a bargain, but it has just seven classrooms, which the school will outgrow after two years. The plan is to buy or build a ''senior academy,'' at a probable price of $10 million, by 2003.</p>
        <p>Two days before school began, Ms. Jordan left the hectic preparations to discuss the capital campaign with two board members over breakfast at the Intercontinental Hotel. ''I do not see the path,'' she acknowledged. ''One of the things I'm seeking advice on is how to get started.''</p>
        <p>Drew Hyde, vice president of the Bronx Museum of the Arts, and Margie Thorn, a former investment banker, suggested scouring for vacant lots, hiring an architect to sketch plans, meeting with other nonprofits about sharing space and finding the rare foundations willing to invest in capital projects. Timetable for such a project? About three years. ''So, looking at '03, you're looking at starting today,'' said Ms. Thorn, who recently led a building fund for a private school.</p>
        <p>An Early Start</p>
        <p>Before opening day, about half of Bronx Prep's students had already logged hours in its classrooms, summer's sun glinting through arched windows.</p>
        <p>Thirty children struggling academically or socially were ordered to attend a two-week preparatory session, which served as a trial run for everything from bathroom procedures (children must sign a log) to Scholar Dollars, a point system to monitor attitude. Orchestra auditions -- students had to mimic a series of clapping beats -- began in late July; a week after receiving their instruments, the violinists were playing harmony for ''The Star Spangled Banner.''</p>
        <p>The teachers, too, trickled in. Three of them, like Mrs. Damiba, are alumni of Teach for America, the national program that places recent college graduates in impoverished classrooms. One just returned from the Peace Corps in Zimbabwe, another spent the last two years teaching in a San Francisco group home for emotionally disturbed teenagers.</p>
        <p>The veteran of the group is 32, with a master's degree in teaching English as a second language, the baby a 1999 Yale graduate facing the front of a classroom for the first time. There are two men and five women; four are white, two black, one Puerto Rican.</p>
        <p>The group spent seven days on team-building and professional development with Frederick L. Shannon, a consultant who is being paid $25,000 for the year. There was also training on Achieve, an $11,000 software program the school plans to use for attendance, lesson plans and discipline reports, though it was not fully online by opening day. (Plus some startup decisions, like whether to deduct 60 cents a week from paychecks to make disability payments tax-free -- yes -- and whether to close school for Martin Luther King's Birthday -- no.)</p>
        <p>One morning, the staff sat in front of a blank blackboard, compiling a list of what they hoped to see at Bronx Prep, from the simple (cleanliness) to the sublime (consistent energy, inspired students, clear expectations). ''I don't want to see our team falling apart,'' offered M. Lopez, 27, the fifth-grade reading teacher, who did not want her full name used because she was a victim of violent crime as a child.</p>
        <p>At the board, Mrs. Damiba, who is not a native English speaker, made several spelling errors -- missing the ''e'' in boredom and adding an extra ''o'' in losing -- and asked staff members for help with words like ''consistent,'' ''physically'' and ''breakdown.''</p>
        <p>''Whatever weaknesses you have, somebody else will have that strength,'' she told her colleagues. ''Whatever strength you have, somebody will need that help. We need to remember that, especially with the kids.''</p>
        <p>For Mrs. Damiba, the challenge is to make a transition from player to coach, designing a school schedule rather than writing lesson plans, wandering the hallway during classes instead of standing behind one of those closed doors. With a background in theater, she is a bigger-than-life presence, a harsh in-your-face disciplinarian one minute and a charming entertainer the next.</p>
        <p>Without a classroom of her own for the first time since she graduated Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., in 1993, she seizes every teaching moment -- at lunch, between classes, and in the daily morning and afternoon meetings.</p>
        <p>The first day of school dawned with a miserable downpour but by 5 p.m. gave way to bright sun. Before dismissal, Mrs. Damiba told the students a story she had heard from the principal of KIPP, a fable about a group of people setting out on a journey, warned by a wise old woman to pick up every pebble. Tired, some of the travelers eventually dumped out their pockets. Upon arrival, those who kept their pebbles found they had turned into diamonds, she said, pulling a shiny stud from her ear.</p>
        <p>''Every day of every year, every moment -- even this moment -- your teachers give you a pebble,'' she told the cafeteria of children full of promise, yet full of problems. ''And you decide. You make the decision. Are you going to hold onto it? Or are you going to throw it away?''</p>
        <p>Starting a School</p>
        <p>Charter schools, which are freed from most regulations of other public schools, are seen by many as the best hope for educational improvement, especially in poor areas. The Bronx Preparatory Charter School is one of 380 opening nationwide this fall. This is the first of a series of visits to the school.</p>
