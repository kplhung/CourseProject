        <p>The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts announced the recipients of its annual honors for outstanding American performers today, and for the first time since the awards were established 22 years ago, most of the recipients are foreign-born.</p>
        <p>They are the dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, born in Riga, Latvia; the tenor Placido Domingo, born in Madrid, and the actress Angela Lansbury, whose London roots are probably little known to millions of television viewers who think of her mainly as an all-American amateur detective in the former ''Murder, She Wrote'' television series.</p>
        <p>They are to receive their awards in December with two recipients born in the United States: the rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry, born in St. Louis, and the actor and director Clint Eastwood, born in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>When the abundance of foreign-born recipients was mentioned to Mr. Baryshnikov, he said: ''Isn't that the tradition of this country? It is so wonderful to immigrants, and I am one of them.''</p>
        <p>Interviewed by telephone in the Dominican Republic, where he is vacationing, he added: ''I am very excited and honored, but accepting this award makes me uncomfortable because so many artists I have worked with in the past 25 years deserve this recognition more than me. I will hold a place in line for them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baryshnikov, now 52, defected in 1974 from the Soviet Union, where he had been a member of the Kirov Ballet, and joined American Ballet Theater in New York. He shifted to the New York City Ballet in 1978 to work with George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins, who have also been honored by the Kennedy Center. He  rejoined American Ballet Theater in 1980 as principal dancer and artistic director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Domingo, 59, has sung 115 roles in the works of Verdi, Wagner, Puccini and others. He has also conducted widely and has taken on administrative roles at the Washington and Los Angeles Operas.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lansbury, 74, has had several distinct chapters in her career, including her early roles in Hollywood movies like ''National Velvet'' with Elizabeth Taylor and ''The Long Hot Summer'' with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward.</p>
        <p>At 22 she played a woman in her 40's who tries to come between Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracey in a classic Washington political movie, Frank Capra's ''State of the Union.'' Then she shifted to the Broadway stage, where her performances included the roles of the eccentric aunt in Jerry Herman's ''Mame'' and the barber's murderous accomplice in Stephen Sondheim's ''Sweeney Todd.''</p>
        <p>She then turned to television detective work, solving a killing every week for 12 years and finding an entirely new audience on television's ''Murder, She Wrote.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berry, 73, the singer-songwriter and guitarist regarded as an originator of rock 'n' roll, has been cited as an influence by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and countless others. John Lennon once said, ''If you tried to give rock 'n' roll another name, you might call it 'Chuck Berry.' ''</p>
        <p>His first recording, ''Maybelline,'' was a 1955 hit. Other big sellers include ''Roll Over Beethoven,'' ''School Days'' and ''Johnny B. Goode.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berry is the first Kennedy Center honors recipient to have served time in prison; in 1959 he received a two-year sentence on a morals case that involved a teen-age  girl in his St. Louis club.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eastwood, 70, appeared in a string of B-movies in the 1950's before landing a role on the long-running television series ''Rawhide.'' He went from there to the spaghetti  westerns directed in Europe by Sergio Leone that made him a star: ''A Fistful of Dollars,'' ''For a Few Dollars More'' and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.''</p>
        <p>He returned to the United States and played many tough-guy roles, becoming the leading box office draw by 1969, and following up with ''Dirty Harry'' in 1971, his most popular role. Mr. Eastwood has directed many films, including ''Bridges of Madison County.''</p>
        <p>Foreign-born performers have received many Kennedy Center Honors in the past, and in 1986 three of the six recipients were from abroad, though they did not make up the majority. They are being cited, in the words of James A. Johnson, chairman of the Kennedy Center, ''for the unique and extremely valuable contributions they have made to the cultural life of our nation.''</p>
        <p>The winners are to be honored on Dec. 3 at the Kennedy Center Opera House in a gala performance that is the center's principal fund-raising event of the year. The program will be taped and broadcast on CBS later in December.</p>
