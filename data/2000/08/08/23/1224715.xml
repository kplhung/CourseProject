        <p>The first American soldiers will arrive in Nigeria this week to train Nigerian troops as peacekeepers for Sierra Leone, though there are concerns  about instructing troops from an army known for recent serious human rights violations.</p>
        <p>The American soldiers, who are being rushed to Nigeria to be there when President Clinton arrives for a state visit on Saturday, will immediately start training and equipping a Nigerian battalion of about 800 men, administration officials said.</p>
        <p>In all, several hundred Americans are set to train about 3,000 Nigerians, who will then be sent to serve under the United Nations command in Sierra Leone, where ruthless guerrillas have specialized in chopping off the limbs of civilian victims.</p>
        <p>But because Nigerian troops were accused by the United Nations and human rights groups of summary executions of alleged members of the rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front, and their civilian sympathizers last year, administration officials said they are aware that training Nigerian soldiers will not be easy.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration was criticized for its failure to provide serious support for the United Nations peacekeeping mission when, despite a peace pact, peacekeepers ran into trouble against the rebels in Sierra Leone earlier this year. As a result, the Clinton administration recently decided to take a new tack and help build a regional force to fight under the United Nations command.</p>
        <p>The switch has been largely welcomed in Congress as a sign of backing words of sympathy for Africa with some muscle. But some members have asked how the American public would react if American-trained Nigerian troops, using American equipment, commit serious rights abuses.</p>
        <p>The rebels in Sierra Leone have proven themselves particularly vicious and are skilled at using women and children as human shields, making the task for forces fighting them extremely complex and creating the temptation for troops to kill civilians in order to kill rebels.</p>
        <p>A report last year by the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, detailed some abuses by Nigerian troops in Sierra Leone, including the summary execution of an 8-year-old boy for possessing a pistol, an execution at a major hospital and other ''summary executions of alleged rebels or rebel sympathizers.''</p>
        <p>A senior administration official who worked on the decision to send the American troops said that there would be ''a significant component'' in training the Nigerians that would emphasize the rules of war. Referring to the Nigerian troops, he added, ''The aim is not to detoughen them but to keep them legal.''</p>
        <p>The chairman of the House International Relations Committee, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of New York, said he was pleased that the administration had decided to take an active role against  the rebels. But, he said, ''In the past the R.U.F. has attacked women and children and used them as human shields. Are we prepared for the prospect of U.S.-trained and equipped forces facing that situation?''</p>
        <p>White House officials said that Mr. Clinton was not planning to meet with the American troops in Nigeria. A small contingent of about 14 American soldiers will arrive in Nigeria from their base in Germany on Thursday. The training will take place near Lagos, officials said, and Mr. Clinton will be in Abuja, the glistening new capital.</p>
        <p>It was decided not to bring the troops and their trainers to the capital as ''window dressing,'' an official said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, much of the focus of Mr. Clinton's visit in Nigeria will not be on Sierra Leone but on showing support for the new civilian leader, Olusegun Obasanjo, who is trying to instill effective civilian control of the military. Mr. Clinton will also focus on AIDS and emphasize that Nigeria is a good place for Americans to do business.</p>
        <p>The Nigerian Army's past human rights abuses in Sierra Leone presented ''a sensitive issue,'' an administration official said.</p>
        <p>In the fight to save the Sierra Leone capital, Freetown, from being overrun by the rebels in early 1999, Nigerian troops were known to have gone on a ''rampage'' when one of their soldiers was killed, and soldiers had sought revenge by killing civilians, the official said.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon acknowledged the need to make training in human rights a part of the mission, the official said, and one of the most important elements in the American training would be to bring discipline to the troops.</p>
        <p>''Fighting this war may not be too clean but we are going to make sure the troops remain disciplined,'' the official said. The United Nations Security Council recently strengthened the mandate of the peacekeepers in Sierra Leone, which will help define the military goals of the Nigerians.</p>
        <p>The Nigerian troops chosen to be trained by the Americans are being closely monitored to weed out soldiers who have violated human rights, another official said. This is being done by the American Embassy in Lagos in accordance with a congressional measure sponsored by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.</p>
        <p>The United Nations will monitor their activities in Nigeria, but the senior United Nations representative in Sierra Leone, Oluyemi Adeniji, is a Nigerian. That could make it difficult to get unbiased assessments of the Nigerian soldiers, a State Department official said.</p>
