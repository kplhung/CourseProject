        <p>Despite a well-advertised effort to bring more blacks, women and Latinos into the New Jersey State Police, only 15 of the 105 cadets scheduled to enter the academy next month are black or Latino, and just one is a woman, according to statistics released by the agency today.</p>
        <p>Early this year, the agency settled a discrimination suit filed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People by agreeing to scrap several requirements that many black applicants considered discriminatory. The state also pledged to make aggressive attempts to advertise and recruit in black and Latino neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>But in releasing the recruitment numbers today, the state police superintendent, Carson J. Dunbar Jr., said he was disappointed that the agency's attempt to diversify its ranks would leave the percentage of minority troopers virtually unchanged, at 14 percent. About 3 percent of the 2,800 current troopers are women, Mr. Dunbar said, so the new class actually represents a decrease in the percentage of women.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunbar said the strong economy was partly to blame for the lackluster results, because many female and minority applicants had found better-paying jobs and decided not to finish the screening process.</p>
        <p>He also acknowledged that the agency's reputation remained tarnished in many black and Latino neighborhoods because of the Justice Department's highly publicized investigation into discrimination by troopers and the state's admission that some officers had engaged in racial profiling for years -- problems that preceded his appointment last year.</p>
        <p>''I wish I could tell you there's a quick fix for this problem,'' said Mr. Dunbar, who became a New Jersey trooper himself in 1973 and was the only minority officer in his class. ''The real answer is, it's going to be a long process.''</p>
        <p>He refused to specify what racial breakdown the force ultimately hopes to reach, saying that he did not want to give the mistaken impression that the state police were adopting a quota system. New Jersey's population is about one-third minority, however, and in the settlement with the N.A.A.C.P. the state agreed to try to broaden the demographics of the force.</p>
        <p>Some elected officials said they were dismayed that the state had failed to deliver on its promise to increase minority representation on the force.</p>
        <p>''The state police have missed a golden opportunity to change its institutional image,'' said Leroy J. Jones Jr., a Democratic assemblyman from Essex County. ''Clearly, they need to reassess their approach and re-examine who they are using as consultants in recruiting more minorities into the ranks.''</p>
        <p>Some current troopers have also complained that the state lowered its physical fitness requirements for new recruits, in an attempt to help female applicants. During the last two years, the state eliminated its pull-up, broad jump and vertical jump requirements, and applicants who fail the physical test may now take it repeatedly until they pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunbar defended the less stringent requirements, saying they still allow the state police to winnow out those applicants who are physically unsuited to perform the job. The state police also worked with several consulting firms to revise the application process and add screening that tests candidates' temperament and decision-making abilities.</p>
        <p>''It's not just about strength, it's about what kind of person you are,'' Mr. Dunbar said.</p>
        <p>The state police are scheduled to begin a new recruiting drive next year and will work with the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives and the National Association of Women in Policing to try and expand the pool of female and minority candidates. The state police may place more emphasis on reaching out to women's sports teams, Mr. Dunbar said, and will continue to recruit at schools and community events in minority neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>But he said that his own experience in law enforcement recruiting, for both the State Police and the F.B.I., had taught him not to expect quick results.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't happen that rapidly,'' he said. ''What I would like to see is steady increases.''</p>
