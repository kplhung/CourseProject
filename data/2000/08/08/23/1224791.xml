        <p>Bottle Rocket, a four-year-old Silicon Alley company that had been struggling to stay afloat, has been acquired by ACTV, a publicly traded company that develops technology for interactive television.</p>
        <p>The terms of the deal were not made public, but Bottle Rocket, which makes custom interactive games for sports and media Internet sites, will retain its name and operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of ACTV.</p>
        <p>William C. Samuels, the chairman and chief executive of ACTV, said Bottle Rocket would help his company develop games that can be played in conjunction with television programs. ''Our interest is in taking what they've learned and tying it into digital TV,'' Mr. Samuels said.</p>
        <p>Greg Easley, the chief executive of Bottle Rocket, said he planned to expand his staff of 35 immediately.</p>
