        <p>As if it were not enough that poor Mabel lives alone in Connecticut, pining for the perfect man who might fill her longings, she is paid surprise visits within hours by Jack and Eddie, two men who competed for her 15 years ago as they all left college -- and each visitor, most conspiratorially, assures her the other is long dead, Jack killed in a barroom brawl over a woman and Eddie a suicide in prison where he was doing time for killing a man in a barroom brawl over a woman. What's more, each is ready to kill the other right now if that's what it takes to possess Mabel for good.</p>
        <p>Putting aside for the moment a certain puzzlement about which man is telling the truth, if either is, what more could Mabel want? If both turn out to be cowards, she gets two of them, and if not she gets the survivor, who by definition must be the fittest.</p>

        <p>As if it were not enough that poor Mabel lives alone in Connecticut, pining for the perfect man who might fill her longings, she is paid surprise visits within hours by Jack and Eddie, two men who competed for her 15 years ago as they all left college -- and each visitor, most conspiratorially, assures her the other is long dead, Jack killed in a barroom brawl over a woman and Eddie a suicide in prison where he was doing time for killing a man in a barroom brawl over a woman. What's more, each is ready to kill the other right now if that's what it takes to possess Mabel for good.</p>
        <p>Putting aside for the moment a certain puzzlement about which man is telling the truth, if either is, what more could Mabel want? If both turn out to be cowards, she gets two of them, and if not she gets the survivor, who by definition must be the fittest.</p>
        <p>Ah, but things are not so simple in ''The Soul of an Intruder'' by Steve Braunstein, seen in a workshop production five years ago and now being given an Off Broadway showing at Theater 3 on West 43rd Street. Finding the truth takes two hours, and it has little to do with which man to believe. In fact, one might reasonably wonder what it has to do with what happens on the stage in what is meant to be a psychological thriller.</p>
        <p>It must be a thriller because Ed McCarthy's lighting keeps doing slightly hallucinatory tricks to Chas W. Roeder's expensive-looking set. That's a sure sign, as it was in ''Gaslight,'' the 1944 film version of a classic Victorian thriller. I can remember cultish teenagers almost 50 years ago gathering at rerun houses to watch Charles Boyer drive Ingrid Bergman mad and signaling in unison their mock anxiety every time the lights flickered: ''Uhhhhh-ohh!'' Of course, there (as the title indicates) the erratic lights were part of the story; here they magnify the confusion of the plot.</p>
        <p>After a long, long while in Mr. Braunstein's effort you begin to suspect that Jack and Eddie are not there at all and pay more attention to Mabel, who, indeed, has gone distinctly odd. At one point Jack (Stephen Beach) is reminding her that 15 years earlier she had taken him and Eddie to bed together in a three-way that ignited their murderous hatred, and when he pauses to pour a drink, she says, ''Please don't keep me in suspense.'' When he returns to his lurid recollections, she starts poking into cabinets and peering under chairs, wondering where she has left her umbrella.</p>
        <p>You know she's round the bend when, moments later, as she quizzes Eddie (Cliff Diamond) about the same crowded bed and he begins to reply, she cries: ''Never tell me what, I don't want to know.'' Ah, so. Mabel (Sylvia Kelegian) has already had what she longs for, and ever since she has been unable to stand it. The thrill may be torture to her, but it sure fizzles for the audience.</p>
        <p>Evidently the director, Frank Cento, has encouraged the actors to play this work in an intimate tone, which means that viewers sitting more than about 10 feet from them miss many lines. That is too bad, since several are much funnier than the playwright seems to have intended. The audience laughs at some of them, but most hesitantly, as if reluctant to be rude. But why not? It is clear early on that it would not take a lot of doctoring to turn this piece into a comic, if cruel, parody of itself and the genre.</p>
        <p>THE SOUL OF AN INTRUDER</p>

Roeder; lighting by Ed McCarthy; sound by Bart Fasbender; production stage manager, Adam Grosswirth; assistant director, Terry Dale. Presented by Herkimer Entertainment.
