        <p>Great balls of fire!</p>
        <p>Alpha Al, you the man. You got your mojo. You are looking goooood!</p>
        <p>Hey you, handsome front-runner in the mirror, give me a high five! Yesssssss! You've got the cool, clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth.</p>
        <p>All right, enough kudos for me and my five-point lead.</p>
        <p>Back to the bench press. I want to buff my pecs and ridge my abs. By the time I meet the Austin airhead at the first debate -- if he even has the nerve to face me -- my shoulders will be twice as broad as his.</p>
        <p>Everybody had written me off -- even my ''loyal'' hired guns and my ''loyal'' Oval Office cheerleader. Everybody figured I was an apple-polisher and W. was apple pie.</p>
        <p>But now 74 percent of the American people know I Have the Right Kind of Experience to Be President. And 62 percent are convinced I Understand the Problems of People Like Them. And 56 percent say I am a Strong Leader. (Margin of error: 3.5 percent.)</p>
        <p>Bounce that, W.!</p>
        <p>Bush thinks a St. Alban's boy like me can't win on class warfare. He can't even pronounce it! He calls it ''class warfore.'' I can't believe I ever trailed a free-trader who can't even spit out ''tariffs and barriers.'' For awhile he was saying ''terriers and bariffs.'' The other night in Des Moines he abbreviated it to merely ''terrors.''</p>
        <p>And when he tries to talk about the budget, he trips on his trillions.</p>
        <p>It's such a relief not to have to pretend anymore that I relished being the underdog and that I didn't care about the polls.</p>
        <p>The truth is, I love polls more than anything -- even my Palm Pilot.</p>
        <p>I am feeling so empowered today, I'm going to do an extra set of reps. Man, those biceps are looking especially chiseled today! Watch out, rural waitress moms, suburban soccer moms and 18-to-24-year-old single female urban dwellers! This stud is coming to a town meeting near you!</p>
        <p>I will be (huff) humble (puff) as I claim my rightful place as Master of the Globe.</p>
        <p>President Ego can march through convention hall basements till noon on Jan. 20, when I'll show him the door. There's a new gladiator in town.</p>
        <p>I've had it with him. My pal Marty Peretz told the BBC that Clinton had been ''a big burden'' to me, and that he had a ''deeply flawed'' and ''loathsome character.'' I'm glad Marty said what Tipper and I really think.</p>
        <p>Ouch! I feel as if I pulled a muscle. I'll stop pumping iron for a moment and strategize. To keep the bounce going, I have to figure out what I did in Los Angeles that changed voters' minds.</p>
        <p>What do I have now that I didn't have before? Which new me works best for me? Were they wowed by Wednesday's earth tones or Thursday's business attire? Do they prefer Al the Lover to Al the Fighter? L.A. Al must not revert to D.C. Al!</p>
        <p>I must focus-group myself. The important thing is not to panic. There's a throb in my deltoid. I'll pop an Altoid. But I need a factoid.</p>
        <p>I'm calling Stan Greenberg. ''Stan? Al. Convene a group ASAP. It is of the utmost urgency that we find out, right now, once and for all, who on earth I am.</p>
        <p>''This is what I want you to find out:</p>
        <p>''DidtheylikeitwhenItalkedfast? Do they want more specificity, less liberalism, more Nashville, less condescension, more Hadassah?</p>
        <p>''Find out if it was The Kiss that swayed independent women my way. Was 4.398 seconds of lip-locking and 18.901 seconds of hugging sufficient? Do they want to see me nibble Tipper's neck? Shall we save a 10-second kiss for our October surprise?</p>
        <p>''Did they see me as My Own Man because we leaked that stuff about our deep disdain for the future First Couple of Chappaqua?</p>
        <p>''Find out if they want me to keep campaign finance reform as my first priority as president. Check if they noticed that I promised reform on Thursday night one hour before scooping up five million at Barbra's fund-raising concert.</p>
        <p>''They seem to have cottoned to Joe. Do they want me to walk to work on Saturdays too?</p>
        <p>''Ask if they still notice The Spot now that my hair's moussed up like Reagan's. They're not comparing the size of my Spot with Joe's spot, are they?</p>
        <p>''Just ask them who they want me to be and if I'm bouncing or slipping.''</p>
