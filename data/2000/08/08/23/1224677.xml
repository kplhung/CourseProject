        <p>EVERY month the National Association of Securities Dealers compiles the short-interest table for Nasdaq stocks, a table that shows just how popular -- or perhaps, unpopular -- a stock is with investors who bet on a decline in price. The numbers are avidly scanned by investors and by the companies themselves. Some investment strategies are based in part on those numbers.</p>
        <p>But how good are those figures? Only as good as the reports from brokerage firms, which are required to add up short positions of their customers on all trades that have been settled by the 15th of each month. And it appears that the N.A.S.D. is doing something less than a stellar job of riding herd on the brokerage firms.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, NASD Regulation, its regulatory arm, announced that E*Trade Securities, a large on-line brokerage firm, had been fined $20,000 because it failed to file such reports for 28 months, from June 1996 through September 1998.</p>
        <p>How did E*Trade manage to go for more than two years without reporting? The firm called it inadvertent, and an N.A.S.D. official agreed.</p>
        <p>Stephen Luparello, a vice president for market regulation of NASD Regulation, said E*Trade, like many other brokerage firms, had arranged for the firm that clears its trades to make the report.</p>
        <p>In 1996, he said, E*Trade began to clear some of its own trades, but did not realize that it had an obligation to file the reports. No one at the N.A.S.D. noticed until 1998, when an examiner spotted the failure during a routine examination of the firm, and referred the matter to NASD Regulation, which began an investigation in January 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Luparello said the association did make sure that every firm it knew had an obligation to file such reports did so every month. But any firm that is newly required to file will only be caught during an examination, he said. ''This is sort of a technical administrative failure where they didn't realize the obligation they had,'' he added, maintaining that the numbers, which E*Trade supplied after going through its records, were ''not material'' to the Nasdaq short-interest figures.</p>
        <p>Those figures show the number of shares of each stock that have been borrowed and sold short, but not yet repurchased, by the reporting date. One reason to short a stock is to bet on its decline; others include arbitrage involving differing securities issued by the same company or involving two companies that are planning to merge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Luparello said that in the first month E*Trade failed to file, its customers had short interest of 314,000 shares in 298 securities. By September 1998, the final month it failed to report, the figure had grown to 1.4 million shares involving 749 companies, while the overall figure for all brokers was 2.15 billion shares.</p>
        <p>Mr. Luparello said that the N.A.S.D. had decided not to update its earlier records after concluding the figures were not material for any stock. He said it would not release the figures for individual stocks, having decided there was no need to make that information public.</p>
        <p>Patrick Di Chiro, an E*Trade spokesman, said: ''As soon as we discovered this inadvertent situation, we immediately moved to correct it. We take our regulatory responsibilities very seriously.''</p>
        <p>The penalty is the second in a few months that indicates E*Trade had a great deal of trouble in dealing with its explosive growth. In May, NASD Regulation fined the brokerage firm, a subsidiary of the E*Trade Group, $20,000 because it had failed to respond to requests for information concerning customer complaints.</p>
        <p>E*Trade shares rose 13 cents yesterday, to $17.25, in Nasdaq trading. The company went public at $2.63 a share, adjusted for subsequent splits, in August 1996 -- a month after it began clearing some trades without complying with reporting requirements. It reached a high of $72.25 in April 1999.</p>
