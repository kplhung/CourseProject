        <p>It is a projected shortage that is casting a shadow over American health care: a decade from now, exploding demand for registered nurses to care for America's graying population could outstrip supply.</p>
        <p>Predictions can be tricky, but government statisticians are paid to try, and they foresee a gap in the R.N. supply starting in 2010 or so. A study in The Journal of the American Medical Association found similar results.</p>
        <p>Registered nurses make up the largest group of health care workers, with about two million at last count, more than 90 percent of them women. And as baby boomers age, the need for health care will surge, making nursing one of the 10 occupations projected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to have the most new jobs by 2008. Demand will be greatest in the small but growing field of home nursing.</p>
        <p>But as job opportunities have opened elsewhere, fewer young women are drawn to nursing. As a result, the average age of R.N.'s is rising faster than that of the general work force. The challenge is how we can change the ergonomics of health care so we don't accelerate the retirement of those people who are already aging, said Dr. Peter I. Buerhaus, an author of the medical journal article. Though he noted that higher wages would attract more people to nursing, advertising and recruiting might also be needed to revitalize the profession.</p>
