        <p>With some of the summer's worst wildfires burning vast stretches of Montana, Gov. Marc Racicot is preparing to restrict access to at least 16 counties in the western part of the state, a decision that would put some of Montana's most popular recreation areas off limits until the fires are brought under control.</p>
        <p>''It is an extremely serious situation for us to be addressing it in these terms,'' Mr. Racicot said today in an interview, referring to an announcement he expected to make on Wednesday.

        <p>With some of the summer's worst wildfires burning vast stretches of Montana, Gov. Marc Racicot is preparing to restrict access to at least 16 counties in the western part of the state, a decision that would put some of Montana's most popular recreation areas off limits until the fires are brought under control.</p>
        <p>''It is an extremely serious situation for us to be addressing it in these terms,'' Mr. Racicot said today in an interview, referring to an announcement he expected to make on Wednesday. ''It's so incredibly difficult for people who rely, in so many ways, on this area for recreation and their livelihood.''</p>
        <p>Montana is one of several Western states in which officials have taken unusual precautionary measures because of wildfires that have now consumed 4.1 million acres in 11 Western states, and some 5.7 million acres in the entire country.</p>
        <p>Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming last week declared the state of Wyoming a disaster area because of wildfires and drought. On Monday, the Forest Service closed the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, a part of Clearwater National Forest in north central Idaho, and the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming.</p>
        <p>The expected decision by Mr. Racicot could include as many as 19 counties, which would effectively reduce access to the entire western third of the Montana to all but those who live and work in areas that fire officials have determined are not in any immediate danger. It would also bring to 28 the number of counties he has restricted access to this month, after an order two weeks ago to shut off all or part of 9 counties in central Montana. The Bureau of Land Management has already closed federal land it controls in those counties.</p>
        <p>The restrictions are intended to minimize the risk of injury by wildfires that have been spreading rapidly by persistently dry weather conditions and, for the most part, temperatures in the upper 80's and low 90's. Mr. Racicot's orders have and are expected to have exceptions for some recreational areas. And several major national parks, like Yellowstone and Glacier, remain open.</p>
        <p>But limiting movement in areas like the Lolo National Forest and the Bitterroot National Forest, is one of several unusual elements that reflect the seriousness of wildfires that are making this one of the worst years in decades for the number of fires in the West -- 20,364 by this morning, with 79 large fires still burning across almost 1.4 million acres in nine Western states.</p>
        <p>Resources have been so strained that for the first time, fire management teams from other countries are assisting. Two supervisory teams from Canada are at work, and a team from Australia is expected.</p>
        <p>''That's unprecedented,'' said J. D. Coleman, a spokesman for the Northern Rockies Coordinating Center in Missoula, Mont. ''Never have we been stretched so thin that we've had to bring in fire management teams from other countries.''</p>
        <p>Howard Parman, a spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, said the firefighting force included 20,000 to 25,000 people, with about 1,200 more soldiers expected to arrive later this week to join about 2,000 others.</p>
        <p>But the fighting force is made up of more than veterans of past fires and even scores of retired firefighters who have joined the efforts. Officials at the fire center estimate that as many as 9,000 college students may be on the lines, many of whom will have to leave in the weeks ahead to return to classes. And in Wyoming, 42 prison inmates are working alongside professional firefighters as part of a program that has been in effect since the 1960's.</p>
        <p>''These are inmates who are about to be released or who have earned the right to less security and are not a threat to society,'' said Melinda Brazzale, a spokeswoman for the Wyoming Department of Corrections. ''They are professionally trained by another firefighter and go out and fight fires all over Wyoming and in South Dakota.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Brazzale said the program had proved beneficial to the inmates and the state, which had saved more than $125,000 this year by using them.</p>
        <p>''That's a savings to federal and local agencies,'' she said. ''It's also a real benefit to the inmates to learn a saleable skill.''</p>
        <p>In addition to personnel needs, firefighting efforts this year have been compounded by the growing number of private homes that have been built inside forest areas, a trend that Governor Racicot and other officials said reflects the nation's vibrant economy. Many of the houses are owned by retirees; others are second homes.</p>
        <p>''They have completely changed how we go about fighting fires,'' Mr. Coleman said. ''So many people have come out West to burrow into woods, draws and creek beds. They like being a modern-day pioneer. But now we have to protect their homes, and with the volume of fires and their complexity, it makes for such an unpredictable situation.''</p>
