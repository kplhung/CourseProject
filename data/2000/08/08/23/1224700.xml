        <p>The two-month trial of the government's landmark antitrust case against Visa and MasterCard limped to the finish line yesterday with both sides expressing satisfaction with their arguments and independent observers reluctant to predict the outcome.</p>
        <p>With the end of testimony and evidence, the heavily lobbied case headed toward the day, slated for late October, when it will go to United States Judge Barbara S. Jones for a decision. That could lead to a restructuring of the giant, highly profitable industry or, at the other extreme, to what in effect would be a ratification of current practice.</p>
        <p>''We believe we have presented strong evidence,'' the assistant attorney general, Joel I. Klein, said in a statement, ''that Visa and MasterCard engaged in conduct that stifled competition and harmed consumers.''</p>
        <p>MasterCard, for its part, contended: ''The absence of evidence is glaring. To make matters even worse, its proposed remedies would likely harm consumers, not help them.''</p>
        <p>The case was filed by the Justice Department nearly two years ago and went to trial June 12 in the federal courtroom in lower Manhattan where I.B.M. fought monopoly charges in the 1980's and where Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of spying in the 1950's. It centers on two main accusations.</p>
        <p>One is that both credit card associations are controlled by the same group of large banks whose representatives sit on both boards. The government contends that this dual governance reduces competition.</p>
        <p>The other target is the practice by the associations, which serve banks that are the actual issuers of credit cards, of forbidding members to also offer those of rivals like American Express or Discover, which is owned by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Visa and MasterCard control about 75 percent of the market.</p>
        <p>''In fact, the evidence showed that if Amex were allowed to issue its cards through MasterCard and Visa banks, consumers would be harmed,'' said Noah Hanft, deputy general counsel of MasterCard in a statement at the end of the trial. ''This is because Amex would only seek to partner with select banks from these networks, which would undermine the associations and their ability to continue offering competitive pricing and advantages to the benefit of consumers.''</p>
        <p>But after 36 witnesses, 18 on each side, and millions of pages of documents, impartial observers, including some who called the government's case unpersuasive, were cautious when asked to predict how Judge Jones will rule.</p>
        <p>''A tossup,'' ventured Bradley Ball, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''It's very difficult to assess where she ultimately will come out,'' he said, pointing to what he said was a concentration of testimony on whether consumers were being harmed rather than on the more technical legal questions.</p>
        <p>Anita L. Boomstein, a credit card specialist at the law firm of Hughes, Hubbard &amp; Reed, declined to predict that Judge Jones would side with the defendants but said she thought the government's case was ''weak'' and overly reliant on academic theory.</p>
        <p>The government, which did not spell out specific remedies it seeks until midtrial, wants to require banks that sit on the MasterCard board to begin issuing only MasterCards and such Visa board members to issue only Visa cards. This would end dual governance, which the government has likened to a big shareholder in Procter &amp; Gamble sitting on the board of Kimberly-Clark, which makes similar products.</p>
        <p>But the trial's final defense witness yesterday, Prof. Robert Pindyck of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, contended that this would limit, not enhance, competition between the two networks as well as among other card issuers and other forms of payment.</p>
        <p>For one thing, the defendants have said, barring joint governance would mean that board members could not issue both kinds of cards, which both parties agree is to be encouraged. And it would restrict banks' ability to play the two card associations against each other.</p>
        <p>Visa is less interested in preserving dual governance than is MasterCard, however, because as the larger network it would more likely prevail if issuers were forced to choose a single partner. Indeed, some testimony has called MasterCard's very survival into question in this situation.</p>
