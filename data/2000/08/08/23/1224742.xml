        <p>Ever since President Clinton appointed William S. Cohen secretary of defense in 1996, Mr. Cohen, the only Republican in the cabinet, has repeatedly claimed to represent the bipartisanship needed to manage matters of national security.</p>
        <p>Now he finds himself -- by all accounts reluctantly -- at the center of a highly partisan debate over the state of the American military. And it has left him in a highly unusual position: defending the administration while at least indirectly underscoring some of the Republican criticisms leveled against it.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Cohen, who represented Maine in the Senate, launched what amounted to a pre-emptive strike against criticisms by Gov. George W. Bush that the Clinton administration was responsible for a weakened, overextended military.</p>
        <p>Appearing only hours before Mr. Bush at the annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Milwaukee, Mr. Cohen noted not only the budget increases approved by Mr. Clinton, including the biggest pay increases for service members in a generation, but also the fact, rarely mentioned by the Bush campaign, that defense budgets started falling rapidly as the cold war ended. That was when another Bush was president and the governor's running mate, Dick Cheney, was secretary of defense.</p>
        <p>The cuts that followed, Mr. Cohen went on to say, reflected a strong bipartisan demand for a ''peace dividend'' now that the United States no longer faced the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>''My constituents from Maine were demanding it, as were people around the country,'' Mr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, who appeared before the group today, offered his own, more partisan defense of the country's military preparedness. Thrusting defense issues to center stage in the presidential campaign for a second day, Mr. Gore went so far as to say that Mr. Bush's repeated attacks on the state of the military ''for political advantage'' threatened to undercut American credibility in the world. [Page A18.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen had offered a rebuttal,  of a sort, to the criticisms that Mr. Bush has repeated throughout his presidential campaign and accentuated since the Republican convention three weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Without mentioning Mr. Bush by name -- or for that matter Mr. Clinton or Mr. Gore -- Mr. Cohen launched a lengthy, detailed defense of the nation's armed services, contending that they remained strong and ready and proved it in last year's war against Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>At the same time, however, Mr. Cohen left open the need for improvement, suggesting that more work, and money, was needed to meet the pressures on an ever busier military engaged in operations from the Persian Gulf to the Balkans -- something Mr. Bush said he intended to rethink, if elected.</p>
        <p>''We can always do better,'' Mr. Cohen told the veterans, ''and national security is certainly a subject matter that is open to debate and improvement. Hopefully that will be the case whatever administration comes in next year.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, in his appearance today, made that point in a more overt, more partisan, more full-throated way.</p>
        <p>''That's not only wrong in fact,'' Mr. Gore said of Mr. Bush's contentions, ''it's the wrong message to send to our allies and adversaries across the world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen's remarks, by contrast, have been more subtle -- and more conflicted.</p>
        <p>While his remarks defending the armed services have sought to counter some of Mr. Bush's criticisms, they have also highlighted shortcomings in spending and readiness that have long been the subject of complaints from Republicans in Congress and even some uniformed leaders.</p>
        <p>As a Republican surrounded by Democrats, Mr. Cohen has always been an oddity in Mr. Clinton's cabinet. He caused a minor stir when he told Barbara Walters in April that he and his wife, Janet Langhart Cohen, a Democrat, would ''in all probability'' vote for different candidates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen later said, ''I indeed did not surrender my Republican credentials when I agreed to serve in the administration.''</p>
        <p>Now, he simply declines to say  whom he plans to vote for.</p>
        <p>Long before he accepted Mr. Clinton's offer to be defense secretary, Mr. Cohen had a reputation as an independent willing to cross party lines to build consensus, particularly  when it comes to defense. Aides in the Pentagon said he took seriously the president's willingness to choose a Republican, hoping to renew a bipartisan spirit with his colleagues who control the House and Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen once said in an interview that he had never sat through a purely political meeting with Mr. Clinton and his advisers; the discussions had always been on the substance of the issues. The political discussions, presumably, began after he left the room.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen's success as a bridge to the Republicans has been mixed.</p>
        <p>Working with the Joint Chiefs of Staff two years ago, he persuaded the administration to agree to a $112 billion increase in defense spending over six years. He has also been the leading administration advocate for building a limited national missile defense.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Cohen has failed to win over Republicans in many areas, like closing more military bases, and Republican criticisms of Mr. Clinton's defense policies have only intensified in Mr. Cohen's years as secretary.</p>
        <p>In May, Mr. Cohen invited Mr. Bush to the Pentagon for a briefing on the state of the nation's strategic nuclear arsenal after Mr. Bush pledged to reduce the number of American nuclear warheads. The invitation was curtly rebuffed.</p>
        <p>However proud Mr. Cohen is of his accomplishments at the Pentagon, he is clearly reluctant to weigh in to  the political debate over them now that the campaign is in full swing.</p>
        <p>He winced when asked at a news conference at the Pentagon on Friday to respond to Mr. Bush's criticism that morale in the ranks was low. When reporters cornered him on Monday to ask about Mr. Bush's remarks, he began by saying, ''Well, I want to keep my comments strictly on the facts and the record and to stay out of the politics as much as possible.''</p>
        <p>A White House official insisted that no one had asked Mr. Cohen to respond to Mr. Bush's criticisms, although Mr. Cohen's remarks clearly indicated that he had the criticisms in mind.</p>
        <p>As for the Gore campaign, ''when we think of somebody who can speak for the vice president or the Democratic Party on military issues, Bill Cohen is not the first name that pops in our head,'' a Gore aide said today.</p>
        <p>In fact, when Mr. Gore's campaign aides sought a defense expert to brief reporters on the issues the vice president raised today, they had to reach back to Mr. Cohen's predecessor as defense secretary, William J. Perry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen was added to the list of  Monday's convention speakers relatively late, defense officials said today, and only because his wife was receiving an award from the veterans.</p>
        <p>''I am not here as a Republican,'' Mr. Cohen himself said on Monday. ''I am not here on behalf of the Democratic administration.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen's posture reflects the fine line walked by men and women in uniform, who are prohibited by law and by policy from participating in overtly political events and thus carefully couch any discussion of political points as strictly factual.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Cohen's defense of the armed forces -- including noting the increase in weapons procurement and highlighting pay raises that officials said have led to rising re-enlistment rates -- are seen by some as an effective counter to the Republican critiques.</p>
        <p>''They can't assail Cohen,'' one person in Mr. Gore's campaign said. ''He's a great surrogate for us. No one can accuse him of politicizing the debate.''</p>
        <p>But that argument has a double edge.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Cohen says that more can be done -- and spent -- his words support arguments made by Mr. Bush's supporters.</p>
        <p>The same thing happened when the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, rebutted Mr. Bush's assertion in his  speech in Philadelphia accepting the Republican presidential nomination  that 2 of the Army's 10 divisions were not ready to fight a major war.</p>
        <p>General Shelton said that was not true, then pointed out that President Clinton's approval of a $112 billion budget increase fell far short of the $148 billion the chiefs had said they needed.</p>
