        <p>Hideo Nomo stirred quite a fuss when he joined the Dodgers in 1995. And there was always a media sideshow around Hideki Irabu in New York. Now names like Masato Yoshii, Mac Suzuki and Kazuhiro Sasaki dot major league rosters.</p>
        <p>And prospects from Asia include the Dodgers' brightest star, outfielder Chin Feng Chen, at Class AAA Albuquerque; the Yankees' Chien-Ming Wang in the Class A New York-Penn League; and Koichi Taniguchi and Kaz Miyakawa, two Japanese-born members of the Newark Bears in the independent Atlantic League.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox have led the push into the Far East and this season promoted pitcher Tomo Ohka from Class AAA Pawtucket, where they also have pitcher Sun Woo Kim. The Seattle Mariners recently gave a bonus of more than $1.3 million to the 18-year-old Korean prospect Shin Soo Choo, who was the most valuable player of the world junior championships.</p>
        <p>One of the Mets' top Asian prospects, the right-hander Jae Weong Seo, has spent the entire season on rehabilitation assignment at St. Lucie, Fla., recovering from off-season arm surgery.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, meanwhile, have liked what they have seen from Wang, who improved to 3-4 with a 2.71 earned run average after Staten Island beat Hudson Valley, 6-3, last night.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of upside potential to him,'' Gary Lavelle, the former major leaguer and current pitching coach for the Class A Yankees, said of Wang, a Taiwan native. ''The language barrier is the most difficult thing. But he's very coachable and very smart and has a good grasp of pitching. He just needs to play against better competition, which is what he's doing now. That's the biggest hurdle for him. He's not used to facing the good hitters he's facing here now.''</p>
        <p>The league has helped Lavelle bridge the language gap by allowing the team to use an interpreter, Dan Mock, during visits to the mound.</p>
        <p>Wang throws a two-seam fastball that dives and a four-seamer that sails. He has a slider and a splitter and is working on a curveball.</p>
        <p>''He's a pretty smart guy on his own,'' said catcher David Parrish, son of the former big-leaguer Lance Parrish. ''He knows what he's trying to do out there. His motion is a lot different than every other pitcher. It's a little more drawn out. He takes his time, somewhat like Hideo Nomo.''</p>
        <p>At 20 years old, the transition to a new country and a new culture has gone smoothly for Wang, who spent the previous two years living away from his family at a physical education school in Taiwan.</p>
        <p>Mock, who shares an apartment with Wang, said the pitcher prefers Chinese food to hamburgers and hot dogs. They spend most of their free time together or with teammates. ''He's a cool guy,'' Parrish said. ''We try to joke around with him as best we can.''</p>
        <p>Between the lines, the transition has been just as smooth. Wang has allowed only 66 hits and 17 walks in 73 innings.</p>
        <p>''Everything's been the same baseball-wise,'' Wang said through Mock. ''The batters are more aggressive, swinging at the first pitch. In Taiwan, batters take until they have a strike.''</p>
        <p>EASTERN LEAGUE</p>
        <p>It was so nice this weekend, the Binghamton Mets and the visiting Portland Sea Dogs got to play three. Three doubleheaders, that is. The teams had an entire series rained out in April, and when they tried to play a Father's Day doubleheader, the first game was rained out with two out in the top of the first inning. Technically, the league would not allow back-to-back-to-back doubleheaders, so the first game Friday night was a continuation of that June game. The first-place Mets no doubt feel a whole lot fresher than the Sea Dogs after sweeping the six games.</p>
        <p>INDEPENDENT LEAGUES</p>
        <p>Newark's Bobby Bonds Jr. saw his hitting streak end at 21 games Friday night in the Bears' 6-0 loss to Long Island. The Ducks' Robert Theodile scattered four hits over eight innings to improve to 9-4.  In the Northern League, the New Jersey Jackals dropped their sixth straight on Sunday, losing to Adirondack by 6-4. The Jackals are 10-20 in the second half.</p>
        <p>MAN VS. BEAST</p>
        <p>The competition was certainly the biggest Rochester's Jose Herrera will face in his career. But Herrera, an International League outfielder, backed up his prediction of victory by beating Zippy Chippy, a 9-year-old gelding, in a 40-yard race at the Red Wings' ballpark.</p>
        <p>Herrera won by about 4 horse lengths. Zippy Chippy has never won a race in 86 starts. He is scheduled to return to the equine ranks next month at Northhampton Fair in Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>''We haven't had a media response like this since Hideki Irabu pitched here for Columbus in 1997,'' Rochester General Manager Dan Mason said.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Esix Snead of Potomac stole two bases Monday to set the Class A Carolina League record with 106 thefts this season in a 4-2 loss to Lynchburg. Snead, whom the Cardinals selected in the 18th round in 1998, broke the record set by Lenny Dykstra with Lynchburg in 1983. ... The Memphis left-hander Bud Smith earned his 15th straight victory in the Redbirds' 3-2 triumph over Colorado Springs. Smith was 12-1 with a 2.32 E.R.A. at Class AA Arkansas before being promoted to the Pacific Coast League. His winning streak is the longest in the minors this season.</p>
