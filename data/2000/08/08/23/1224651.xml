        <p>THE SHARK NET  By Robert Drewe  289 pages. Viking. $24.95.</p>
        <p>Perth -- the most isolated city in the world, or so they like to say there out there on the western coast of Australia -- sits facing the Indian Ocean, which stretches endlessly to Africa. Robert Drewe, the Australian novelist and playwright who grew up there, makes the place sound a bit like Albert Camus's North Africa, blinding in its brightness and dominated by the maritime elements:</p>
        <p>''There was nothing in the straight white coastline to give your eyes a rest -- no bays, few trees to break the line and the glare and the shuddering mirages. Often on hot days the smell of something dead rose from the dunes and filled your head. . . . You became dizzy and got a headache if you looked toward Africa too long.''</p>
        <p>It is that smell of something dead that is the suggestive element in ''The Shark Net,'' Mr. Drewe's spiced and savory memoir of his boyhood years in Perth, when the rampages of a serial killer mingled with the more normal events of a young life, making them all seem like threads of the same tableau. Or perhaps these other events are not so normal after all. They only seem that way in comparison with the murders committed by one Eric Cooke, a possibly insane man who shot or stabbed eight strangers to death in Perth between 1959 and 1963.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drewe treats all of this, normal and not, with a kind of quizzical power of observation that gives his book a whiff of mystery and plenty of charm.</p>
        <p>He begins with a description of the light in the courtroom in which Cooke was convicted of murder: ''harsher, dustier, more ancient looking'' than normal light. And he lets us know early on that the trial, somehow, would be an instrument in the transformation of his own life. He was on the scene as a reporter for The West Australian, the newspaper that Mr. Drewe, still only 19, had begun working for shortly before. But he soon lets us know that the trial, taking place amid the ordinary artifacts of conventional suburban life, was affecting him deeply.</p>
        <p>''The murders had stopped,'' he writes. ''Life would go on. But it was clear that my life wouldn't continue as normal.''</p>
        <p>The rest of Mr. Drewe's memoir in a sense explains why this was so, though he doesn't provide a full explanation until he returns to Cooke's trial near the end of the book. In the meantime he provides a chronicle of growing up in a normatively dysfunctional family in sun-stroked, sea-dazzled Perth, a chronicle wherein the mature man attains a kind of bemused control over the eager foolishness of his earlier self.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drewe's father was a state manager for Dunlop, the rubber company, in which he invested emotions that he did not bestow on his family. His mother suffered quietly and yearned for more, which Mr. Drewe, the oldest of her three children, discovered when he went with her to hear a speech by the evangelist Billy Graham.</p>
        <p>The series of murders that terrified Perth during Mr. Drewe's teenage years were personal to him because he knew one of the victims -- a boy named John Sturkey, shot in the head while he slept on the porch of his rooming house -- and he knew Cooke. Mr. Drewe provides telling glimpses of Cooke as a misfit who was ridiculed growing up because of a harelip and a speech impediment. He remembers him lurking at Saturday night parties and approaching young women, who spurned him, even as his wife and seven children stayed at home.</p>
        <p>''The Shark Net'' is not what you would call a true crime story; its purpose is not to delve deeply into the minds of a killer and the police officers who caught him. But as Mr. Drewe recounts his young man's wonderment at the criminal and the evil he wrought, he does cast some doubt on a legal system that, first, convicted two other men of two of the crimes that Cooke committed and gave only the most passing consideration to the possibility that he was insane.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile Mr. Drewe was growing up, forced to do so quickly when his girlfriend got pregnant and, not long after that, his mother died of a cerebral aneurysm. Mr. Drewe marvelously evokes the residual Victorian primness of his childhood in a conversation he had with his family's doctor.</p>
        <p>''You've probably been wondering whether you killed her,'' the good doctor begins, referring to the shock Mr. Drewe's mother experienced when she learned that he had a girlfriend (of a different religion no less) and that she was pregnant. It is not certain, the doctor goes on. Then, prescribing phenobarbital to the young Robert, he reduces this searing moral question to a handy piece of arithmetic: ''I think we're looking at a 60-40 situation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Drewe, though young, is happy in his marriage and with the son who soon comes along. He works hard as a reporter, hoping, as he looks for stories of shark attacks along the Perthian coast, that an attack will happen and that he can become a hero by leaping into the waves and saving someone. But then he is scooped by a rival reporter who learns that Mr. Drewe's friend has drowned in the heavy surf that Mr. Drewe had swum in the same day, which leads him to a brief disquisition on the shark nets of his title, those screens the authorities put up to protect swimmers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drewe does not seem to be in favor of shark nets: you've got a better chance of dying in a plane crash or from just plain foolishness than you do being attacked by a shark. Sharks here represent the human imagination, how we organize the data of experience in our minds as we react to the presence of a mad killer among us, or perhaps to the death of a mother or to some of the lesser accidents of life. In the deepest sense Mr. Drewe's affecting memoir is the story of how one man comes to terms with the absence of ultimate protection, with the reality that for some things the only safety net comes from within.</p>
