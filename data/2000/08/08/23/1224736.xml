        <p>Months ago, when a special-education teacher here said she had unfairly been forced to resign in the face of salacious rumors that she had had sex with teenage boys from her school, many in this bucolic river town in northern Westchester County rallied to her side.</p>
        <p>The rumors became headlines on Monday, when Marci Stein, 28, was indicted on charges of statutory rape, sodomy and sexual abuse of three male students, ages 14 to 16.</p>
        <p>But as the weight of the allegations sank in around town today, many people said they still supported Mrs. Stein, a member of a family with deep roots in the community.</p>
        <p>''I still can't believe it's true,'' said Harry DiPietro, the owner of Da-Ro's Corner Store. ''You and I know that with indictments you only hear one side. I would hope that when it all comes out she'll be all right.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Stein, who was released without bail, stood silently today in the driveway of her ranch house in the village of Buchanan, her eyes covered by dark sunglasses, as her husband, Adam, told a reporter the accusations were false.</p>
        <p>''It couldn't be a bigger lie,'' said Mr. Stein, a federal marshal and a veteran of the Persian Gulf war, waving his arms for emphasis. ''Everyone supports us -- except for the school board and the kids and the parents and, of course, the district attorney.''</p>
        <p>Adam and Marci Stein and their parents graduated from Hendrick Hudson High School. Their grandparents were on the school board, he said. Her father is a well-known local electrician. His father is the building inspector in Tarrytown, a few miles south on the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>The charges against Mrs. Stein seemed a touchy subject to many here. Some people expressed shock; some refused to comment.</p>
        <p>Alfred J. Donahue, the mayor of the Village of Buchanan, did not return calls seeking comment. An aide to Linda D. Puglisi, the supervisor of the Town of Cortlandt, which encompasses the hamlet of Montrose, said that on the advice of the town's lawyer, she and the Town Council would not comment on the matter.</p>
        <p>But those who did comment included Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, who said Mrs. Stein had taken three male students to her home for individual tutoring sessions and wound up raping and sodomizing them in incidents between April 1999 and last January.</p>
        <p>The boys were interviewed by the authorities after a teacher overheard talk in school about the sexual allegations and alerted school officials, who conducted an investigation and called the state police.</p>
        <p>According to the indictment, Mrs. Stein fondled the boys as they sat at their desks in school and at subsequent encounters in her home after school had sexual intercourse with one of them and committed sodomy with two others.</p>
        <p>''I think that this case is pointedly all about a betrayal of trust,'' Mrs. Pirro said today, a day after Mrs. Stein pleaded not guilty in Westchester County Court to charges in a 17-count indictment. ''We send our children to school for them to be educated and never do we expect this kind of thing to happen, nor do we anticipate it nor do we imagine it.''</p>
        <p>In April, Mrs. Stein resigned and filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the district, accusing officials of spreading false rumors about her and threatening to fire her after she had two years on the job. Her supporters held a candlelight vigil in front of the school.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Lovett, Mrs. Stein's lawyer in the civil rights lawsuit, said today that Mrs. Stein would be acquitted at trial and vindicated.</p>
        <p>''This case is a beautiful example of character assassination from the school district up to the district attorney,'' he said. ''It is a lot of grandstanding to ruin the reputation and career of a young woman. And they are going to pay.'' John Mancuso, who is acting as Mrs. Stein's lawyer in the criminal matter, did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>School officials refused to comment, citing the pending lawsuit against the district. But Joan Thompson, the Hendrick Hudson School District superintendent, released a statement defending the district's investigation of allegations of sexual misconduct by Mrs. Stein. It said the decision to remove her from her job was ''necessary for the protection of the student body.''</p>
        <p>At Cole's Market, on Albany Post Road, things were less clear.</p>
        <p>Tommy Cole, the owner of the market, said that damage had been done to the Steins, no matter what the ultimate verdict is.</p>
        <p>''Especially in a teaching position, they'll wind up getting destroyed and having their life and career ruined before any truth is found out,'' he said. ''If they did it, they did it. If they didn't, then they're still going to be damaged just because they were accused.''</p>
