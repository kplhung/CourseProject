        <p>Editors' Note on August 5 article on Barneys New York performance since emergence from bankruptcy; critics of departing chief executive, Allen L Questrom, were quoted, and Times should have included response; factual and spelling errors also noted</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article in Business Day on Aug. 5 reported on the performance of Barneys New York since its emergence from bankruptcy in January 1999. Critics of the departing chief executive, Allen L. Questrom, were quoted as saying that he had shifted the company away from its traditional emphasis on the most cutting-edge designers.</p>
        <p>In fairness, The Times should have included a response from the company. In a statement, the company has since said, ''Barneys today is every bit the fashion incubator that it has ever been.''</p>
        <p>Because of an editing error, the article also referred imprecisely to the company's prospects for raising money through a stock sale. Concerns about Barneys and the industry's stocks over all rule out a share issue any time soon. They do not rule out ''a quick return to public ownership''; Barneys already has stockholders, although its shares are not traded regularly.</p>
        <p>The article also misspelled the names of the two firms that own a majority share of the company and misstated the number of senior employees who have resigned in the last three months. The firms are Bay Harbour Management, not Bar Harbour, and Whippoorwill Associates, not Whipporwill. Eight senior employees, not nine, have resigned in the last three months.</p>
