        <p>Mitsubishi Motors admitted today that it had systematically concealed customer complaints about tens of thousands of defective automobiles since 1977.</p>
        <p>The admission by Mitsubishi, Japan's No. 4 automaker, came a month after its top executive had denied accusations that it had covered up problems that included faulty fuel tanks, clutches, crankshafts and brakes.</p>
        <p>As part of the admission, the company recalled 88,000 cars and trucks, adding to a recall of 532,000 vehicles announced last month. The recalls, which are expected to cost about $69 million, mostly affect vehicles sold in Japan. But while Mitsubishi officials in Japan said the recall would include 50,000 vehicles exported to the United States, the company's United States arm, Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, said only about 10,000 vehicles were involved.</p>
        <p>There was no evidence that the defects had caused any fatal or otherwise serious accidents.</p>
        <p>Under United States and Japanese law, automakers must notify the government about defects reported to them by customers. By ignoring this requirement, Mitsubishi had avoided potentially costly recalls, which are considered especially humiliating for a Japanese auto company.</p>
        <p>''We sincerely apologize to the drivers of our cars,'' said Katsuhiko Kawasoe, president of Mitsubishi. ''My job is to work to regain the public's trust in this company.''</p>
        <p>It was unclear how such a pattern of deception could have gone on for so long without the knowledge of high-level executives.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kawasoe, who said he had no knowledge of the cover-up until it was documented in an internal investigation submitted to the government today, promised that the company would punish those who were directly responsible. He also said he and other top Mitsubishi executives would take a salary cut to acknowledge their accountability. Mr. Kawasoe said, however, that he did not intend to resign.</p>
        <p>The internal investigation found that Mitsubishi employees had repaired the defects but had initialed the customer complaints with an  ''H'' for ''hitoku,'' which means conceal, or ''horyu,'' which means defer or hold. None of these complaints were reported to the government.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Ministry said it was studying the possibility of recommending penalties for Mitsubishi because of the cover-up, including criminal prosecution.</p>
        <p>It was unclear what kind of sanctions the company might face in the United States. But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department, said today that it was interested in Mitsubishi's conduct.</p>
        <p>''We have asked Mitsubishi if any of the activities in Japan have a bearing on vehicles sold in the United States,'' said Tim Hurd, a highway safety administration spokesman.</p>
        <p>The vehicles being recalled in the United States were all imports from Japan. Pierre Gagnon, chief operating officer of Mitsubishi's American sales unit, said the product recalls would have a minimal impact on United States operations or sales.</p>
        <p>The admission of a cover-up could further damage the already troubled image of Mitsubishi, maker of such models as the Montero sport utility vehicle, Galant sedan and Mirage compact, at a time when it is trying to stimulate sales through alliances with DaimlerChrysler and Volvo.</p>
        <p>Mitsubishi is the second major Japanese manufacturer to confront a significant recall the last two weeks. Bridgestone/Firestone announced on Aug. 9 that it would replace 6.5 million potentially dangerous tires.</p>
        <p>As part of Mitsubishi's action today, Mr. Kawasoe visited the transportation minister, Hajime Morita, in Tokyo, apologizing in a deep bow that was widely reported in Japan.</p>
        <p>''The whole state of affairs is, in a word, the result of a lack of respect for rules and regulations on the part of the company officers and employees involved,'' Mr. Kawasoe said.</p>
        <p>Last month, when rumors of a cover-up first began to circulate, Mr. Kawasoe said they were untrue.</p>
        <p>The rumors turned into a scandal after Transportation Ministry officials, evidently acting on an anonymous telephone tip, discovered a pile of customer complaints in a company locker room during an inspection.</p>
        <p>The practice of hiding evidence that could lead to a recall in Japan is not new. Recalls, particularly for automakers, are considered an enormous humiliation. Japan's automotive manufacturers are acclaimed year after year for the superior quality and durability of vehicles, often beating their American competitors in consumer tests.</p>
        <p>Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru, was fined in 1997 for repairing defective vehicles without reporting the defects to the government, which could have led to a recall.</p>
        <p>In fact, a law that prohibits such cover-ups, the Road Vehicles Act, was toughened after Fuji Heavy's violation. But although the steepest fine was quintupled to one million yen -- only about $9,200.</p>
        <p>Mitsubishi officials in Japan said the recalls of vehicles exported to the United States cover leaking brake fluid in the Montero, a potentially loose chassis joint on the Galant and and a potentially loose engine shaft on the Mirage.</p>
        <p>Company executives in the United States, however, said the recall affected 10,000 1995 and '96 Galants for possible fuel-tank cracks and 344 Monteros overlooked in a 1996 recall. They added that 34,000 Mirages from 1995-97 might be recalled for possible failures of crankshaft pulley bolts.</p>
        <p>The negative publicity over Mitsubishi's cover-up could compound its overall problem of weak sales at home and abroad. The company's domestic sales in the first six months of this year fell 3.2 percent compared with the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Toyota Motor's sales, meanwhile, rose 5.3 percent, and Honda Motor's sales rose 9.7 percent.</p>
        <p>The stock of Mitsubishi has also been hammered, particularly the last few weeks as rumors of the cover-up frightened investors. The shares fell 2.1 percent today, to 429 yen (about $3.94), and are down 15 percent from their high for the year of 497 yen reached early last month.</p>
        <p>Mitsubishi's competitive problems were a major reason it agreed to an alliance with DaimlerChrysler, which took a 34 percent stake in the company under a deal signed less than a month ago.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler officials in Japan and the United States declined to comment about the cover-up. But Karin Funke, a spokeswoman for the company at its headquarters in Germany, was quoted by Dow Jones Newswires as saying it would not affect the relationship. ''This is a matter that concerns Mitsubishi alone,'' she was quoted as saying.</p>
