      <abstract>
        <p>Op-Ed article by Nora Roberts, author of 135 romance novels, says romantic aspect of Al and Tipper Gore's prolonged kiss and embrace at Democratic National Convention seems to have eluded political commentators but was not missed by nation's women; says Gore's public expression of love and appreciation for life mate at moment he reached pinnacle of his career may gain him votes in November (M)</p>

        <p>Sex and politics always make an intriguing couple, but usually what we hear and read about are illicit sex and dirty politics. When it's sexual zing between a happily married and political couple on national television, apparently we don't know what to make of it.</p>

        <p>Sex and politics always make an intriguing couple, but usually what we hear and read about are illicit sex and dirty politics. When it's sexual zing between a happily married and political couple on national television, apparently we don't know what to make of it.</p>
        <p>When Al Gore planted a big kiss on his wife, Tipper, at the Democratic Convention, it wasn't the nice, firm and friendly peck it appeared she, and the rest of us, were expecting. It was, to me, sweet, sexy, amusing and romantic all at once. That's a lot of punch from one kiss.</p>
        <p>You go, Al.</p>
        <p>Despite the endless speculation in the days since that this was all about  Mr. Gore showing the world he wouldn't be involved in any Monica Lewinsky-like scandals, what I saw in the Gores' kiss was a man and woman, married long enough to be grandparents, embracing at one of the high points of their personal and professional lives.</p>
        <p>The kiss came after a taped montage of their life together and directly after Tipper introduced Al as the man she fell in love with at first sight. A good strong kiss seems pretty appropriate to me at such a moment.</p>
        <p>If I'd been writing the internal dialogue of Al Gore, so often described as a cardboard man, when he pulled Tipper into that clinch, it would run something like this: ''This is our moment. Look where we are, after all these years. Look what we've achieved. Together. I love you.''</p>
        <p>The love in that kiss speaks to me as a woman, as one who appreciates both intellect and romance. This was  a man who, at one of the pinnacles of his political career, felt compelled to show his wife his love, his need and his gratitude.</p>
        <p>What could be more romantic?</p>
        <p>And it is the romance that seems to have eluded all the political commentators, despite their endless search for new angles to analyze. But I'll bet it wasn't missed by the nation's women.</p>
        <p>I can only assume that there were a great many women watching, as I was, who would hope they would be as important, as essential to a life mate at a crowning moment in his career, as Tipper was at that moment to Al.</p>
        <p>I think Mrs. Gore was, initially, a bit taken aback. But she rallied, put her arms around him and was as much a part of that moment, of that kiss, as he was. The embrace after the kiss was even sweeter, even more intimate, to my mind, than the kiss itself. This made them a team, demonstrated a passion between them and from them that I think women voters will admire and respect.</p>
        <p>But will those women voters show that admiration in the voting booths? None of the women I know would be swayed in their political judgments merely by the sight of a guy locking lips with his wife on TV, any more than a man would cast a vote for a candidate based on his ability to throw the perfect sinking curve ball. We are not quite that simple.</p>
        <p>But while a kiss has nothing to do with platform or policy, it does speak, very clearly, to human nature. Love matters, even in politics, or we as women -- as voters or as candidates -- should hope it does. Candidates can make promises or sling mud, and will, endlessly. But show me the heart of the candidate, and I -- as a woman -- will pay more attention to that candidate's words.</p>
        <p>We had a glimpse inside the heart when Mr. Gore embraced his wife before he addressed the world as the Democratic presidential nominee. That heart took one long, public moment to express love for a woman. A lot of us may pay more attention to Mr. Gore's words because of that quick, endearing and romantic impulse.</p>
        <p>Will it add up to more votes in November? If we like what we hear, maybe it will.</p>
