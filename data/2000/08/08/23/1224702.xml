        <p>The executive vice president of Major League Soccer said yesterday that Mamadou Diallo of Tampa Bay was not punished for injuring Mike Ammann of the MetroStars in a game last Wednesday because there was no evidence that the player had intended to hurt the goalie.</p>
        <p>The injuries to Ammann, who is out for the season, have jeopardized the MetroStars' chances of winning the league title. The backup goalkeeper, Tim Howard, will be with the Olympic team in Australia, leaving the team without an established goalkeeper for at least three weeks next month.</p>
        <p>Ivan Gazidis, the league official, discussed the matter for the first time with members of the news media yesterday in a conference call.</p>
        <p>''It was a nasty collision and there is not a person in the league office or associated with soccer who does not feel sick about Mike's injuries,'' Gazidis said. But he said the league's disciplinary committee and Commissioner Don Garber repeatedly reviewed the incident and determined ''there was no evidence of intent to injure.''</p>
        <p>The MetroStars plan to appeal the decision not to penalize the Tampa Bay player. General Manager Nick Sakiewicz refused to say whether the appeal would be sent to the league, the United States Soccer Federation, which is the governing body of soccer in this country, or to FIFA, the world governing body.</p>
        <p>''We don't agree with the decision, from the owners all the way down to the last person in our office, and we will appeal,'' Sakiewicz said. ''And that's all I'm going to say about this right now.''</p>
        <p>Replays of the incident showed that Diallo had time to jump over the sprawled Ammann after the goalkeeper had come off his line to collect the ball. Diallo caught Ammann with his left knee in the rib-cage area and then stepped on his head with his right foot. Ammann suffered three broken ribs and a punctured lung from the contact with the knee, and a severe bruise on his right cheek from Diallo's right foot.</p>
        <p>One thing the MetroStars will not appeal is the $250 fine the league imposed on Mike Petke yesterday for displaying a T-shirt that echoed the MetroStars' feelings about Diallo's action against Ammann.</p>
        <p>''We expected it,'' Sakiewicz said of the fine on Petke. ''Sometimes, freedom of speech costs money.''</p>
        <p>After scoring the fifth goal for the MetroStars in the 5-3 victory over Colorado Sunday at Giants Stadium, Petke displayed a T-shirt underneath his jersey that read ''Aug. 16: The Crime of the Century,'' on the front and ''Revenge is Coming'' on the back.</p>
        <p>Ammann was hospitalized in Tampa, Fla., and was unable to fly until Monday. He said from his home in New Jersey yesterday that he had seen a specialist who prescribed treatment to remove fluid, mostly blood, from his lung.</p>
        <p>With Ammann out for the season and Howard joining the Olympic team in two weeks, the MetroStars must find a goalkeeper or two for the stretch run in the regular season and perhaps the first round of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Coach Octavio Zambrano said after yesterday's practice at Kean University in Union, N.J., that Russell Payne would be Howard's backup for tonight's game against the visiting Kansas City Wizards, the team the MetroStars are chasing for first place over all in the league.</p>
        <p>Payne, who plays for the Boston Bulldogs in the A-League, played for eight minutes against Colorado on Sunday and allowed two goals. Bill Andracki of the Rochester Rhinos and Paul Grafer of the Long Island Rough Riders are two other candidates to fill the void.</p>
