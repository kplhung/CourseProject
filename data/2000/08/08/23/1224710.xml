        <p>While most American athletes are preparing for events like swimming, gymnastics and track and field at the Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia, a number of them are preparing for the burgeoning Olympic sport of arbitration.</p>
        <p>Code of conduct and grievance procedures that govern American Olympians allow athletes to take disputes to binding arbitration. Generally, it is a good idea for athletes to have this avenue available to seek redress from unnecessarily subjective methods by which various sports federations choose their Olympic teams.</p>
        <p>But the arbitration process appears to have been abused in two prominent cases. The Greco-Roman wrestler Keith Sieracki and the cyclist Christine Witty were both named to the American Olympic team, only to have their selections challenged by other athletes who did not qualify. However, both Sieracki and Witty say that they were never notified of the arbitration hearings or given a chance to defend themselves. Because their rights of due process were violated, they say, the subsequent rulings against them should be invalidated.</p>
        <p>At the Greco-Roman Olympic trials in June, Sieracki, an Army sergeant, defeated the four-time national champion Matt Lindland, 2-1, in the deciding third bout of the 167 1/2-pound category. Lindland filed an immediate protest, saying he had been tripped, in violation of the rules. Greco-Roman wrestling prohibits use of the legs to conduct a maneuver, but incidental contact is allowed. Lindland filed two protests with the United States wrestling federation, the sport's national governing body, and both were denied.</p>
        <p>Lindland then took his case to an arbitrator, who ordered a rematch. This time, Lindland won, 8-0. Sieracki said, however, that he thought the rematch was simply part of training for the Olympics. He filed a counterclaim, saying that the arbitration ruling should be meaningless because he was not invited to participate. A second arbitrator ruled in his favor in a preliminary hearing. The case will continue today in Denver.</p>
        <p>Equally troubling in the Sieracki case is the idea that a referee's decision could be grounds for arbitration. Carried to the extreme, every ball and strike called in a baseball game could be subjected to review before the outcome was decided. Imagine the chaos in figure skating, which combines artistry with sport and carries a great deal of subjectivity in the judging.</p>
        <p>The great attraction of sport is that, unlike in everyday life, victories and losses are clearly defined. Perhaps the officials made an error in the Sieracki-Lindland match at the Olympic trials. People make mistakes. But that should not be grounds for arbitration. There is no quicker way to kill spectator interest than to have a game played and the outcome decided a month later by lawyers.</p>
        <p>''Three officials were there,'' said Sieracki's lawyer, Lt. Col. Dan Shaver, referring to the referees at the Olympic trials. ''The integrity of the officiating has to rely on those three officials. If not, why not videotape every match and let arbitrators make the decision?''</p>
        <p>Witty, who won silver and bronze medals in speedskating at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, is attempting to become the fourth person to win medals at both the Winter and Summer Games. In the Olympic cycling trials in April, she finished second to Tammy Thomas in the 500-meter time trial. But Witty was named to the American team instead of Thomas because the United States cycling federation used the criterion of international performance over the past two years. Witty won the 1998 national championship and finished fourth at the 1998 world championships in the 500-meter time trial, a two-lap race against the clock.</p>
        <p>Thomas protested to an arbitrator, who ordered a ride-off last Sunday in Frisco, Tex. Witty did not show up, and Thomas circled the track alone. Because she had never been invited to the arbitration hearing, Witty contended, she was not bound by any order for a rematch. She has filed her own arbitration case, scheduled for Saturday.</p>
        <p>''She was never invited to defend herself,'' said Witty's lawyer, Jeff Benz. ''There was no due process.''</p>
        <p>Even stranger, Benz and the cycling federation said, the arbitrator's ruling did not say that the winner of the rematch should be placed on the Olympic team. Like Thomas in Sunday's ride-off, the case continues aimlessly around in circles.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the cast members of ''Survivor'' could also determine the outcome of these Olympic cases in tonight's finale. At least a couple of anonymous sports would get enormous television ratings.</p>
        <p>''It would be nice to have athletes deciding the Olympic teams instead of lawyers,'' said Rich Wanninger, director of communications for USA Cycling.</p>
        <p>''We're going to have to start including bios of the lawyers in our media guide.''</p>
