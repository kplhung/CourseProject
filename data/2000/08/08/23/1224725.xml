        <p>Aides to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said today that state and other taxpayer assistance should not exceed $75 million. That figure is well below the $123 million in state aid that the YankeeNets, owner of the New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils, have put forward in recent weeks as the minimum they need.

        <p>The long-awaited bargaining over state aid for a new sports arena here has begun in earnest.</p>
        <p>Aides to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said today that state and other taxpayer assistance should not exceed $75 million. That figure is well below the $123 million in state aid that the YankeeNets, owner of the New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils, have put forward in recent weeks as the minimum they need. In the past, the teams' owners have said they would also need $25 million in aid from the city to relocate from the state-owned Continental Arena at the Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>The $325 million arena for the two teams is to be built in downtown Newark; officials hope it will solidify the city's renaissance.</p>
        <p>Underscoring the Whitman administration's view on the limits of public contributions, Mike Torpey, her chief of staff, said in a letter to the YankeeNets owners that any contributions from city and county government would result in an equal reduction in other state aid to those municipalities.</p>
        <p>But what many characterized in private as a tough opening negotiating stand by the governor was nevertheless viewed with gratitude in public by the Newark, Essex County and YankeeNets officials who support the arena proposal; they applauded it as a first sign of support.</p>
        <p>''It is a step in the right direction, and the right direction for us is Newark,'' said Harvey Schiller, the chairman and chief executive of YankeeNets.</p>
        <p>Sharpe James, the mayor of Newark, said the governor had taken ''a leadership role in keeping professional sports in New Jersey,'' and James Treffinger, the Essex County executive, called Mr. Torpey's letter ''a very positive first step.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Torpey, in an interview, said the letter set ''the parameters of further negotiations,'' although he cautioned that the $75 million in assistance alone was likely to run into trouble in a legislature not eager to support professional sports complexes in Newark or elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The letter was released on the day that the YankeeNets finalized the $176 million purchase of the National Hockey League's New Jersey Devils.</p>
        <p>One of the intentions of the letter from Mr. Torpey, said other officials familiar with the politics of the arena negotiations, was to serve notice to the YankeeNets that they should not try to use local elected officials to help wring more money out of the taxpayers and to confine their negotiations to the state.</p>
        <p>Since the New Jersey Nets were acquired three years ago by a group led by Raymond Chambers, a philanthropist, the group has hoped to help rebuild Newark by relocating there. But Governor Whitman has said that the state would not contribute anything unless the arena had two sports teams to make it economically viable, a condition that was met with the final acquisition of the Devils.</p>
        <p>In the letter to the YankeeNets, Mr. Torpey held out yet another opportunity to the two teams to remain at the Meadowlands arena, saying that the teams could be housed in a new arena there for less money: $250 million that would include the same $75 million in state assistance.</p>
        <p>''There's no harm in us keeping the alternative of the Meadowlands on the table,'' he said in an interview. ''But ultimately they have made it clear that it is their desire to go to Newark.''</p>
