        <p>Stock prices were mixed yesterday after the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged.</p>
        <p>The Fed's decision to keep the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 6.5 percent had been widely expected. Still, stocks of financial services companies, which stand to benefit if interest rates stabilize or start to fall, were the standout performers.</p>
        <p>''This is what the market wanted to see,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''The view is that we are now in a friendlier rate environment.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, after reading the central bank's so-called policy directive, analysts said that the Fed was not likely to prove threatening to stock investors, at least for the next few months.</p>
        <p>''Given what we know today, the consensus view is that the Fed has finished raising interest rates for the year,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief global economist and investment strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities.</p>
        <p>Led by J. P. Morgan, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 59.34 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,139.15. The Nasdaq composite index gained 5.06, or 0.1 percent, to 3,958.21. But the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.35, or 0.1 percent, to 1,498.13.</p>
        <p>Before the Fed made its midafternoon announcement, major market gauges were all solidly higher. But selling set in after the news was reported.</p>
        <p>''We had the potential for a pullback no matter what the Fed did because the market has had a good month,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ''It is too early to say the Fed is done for the year, but unless we get really bad inflation numbers, I suspect the Fed will be on hold until after the election.''</p>
        <p>Financial service stocks, especially banks, did well.</p>
        <p>J. P. Morgan rose $3.56, to $148.50. Chase Manhattan gained $1.56, to $52.50, while Citigroup advanced 69  cents, to $77.31, and Wells Fargo rose $1.19, to $45.56.</p>
        <p>Technology stocks were mixed.</p>
        <p>Nortel Networks, a component of the S.&amp; P. 500, gained $2.13, to $83. Intel managed its eighth consecutive gain, rising 6 cents, to $72.13. And Microsoft rose 63 cents, to $71.25.</p>
        <p>Cisco Systems fell 69 cents, to $64.81, however. Qualcomm shed $2.38, to $56.63, and Dell Computer dropped $1.31, to $37.44.</p>
        <p>AMR, the parent of American Airlines, gained $1.19, to $33.81, after Goldman, Sachs lifted its third-quarter profit estimate.</p>
        <p>But forest products companies fell after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter lowered profit estimates for this year and for 2001.</p>
        <p>International Paper fell 44 cents, to $32.31. Weyerhaeuser dropped $1.31, to $46.88, and Temple Inland fell $1.25, to $43.69.</p>
        <p>Medtronic had a bad day, falling $3.13, to $49.69, after the world's largest pacemaker manufacturer reported quarterly sales that fell short of expectations.</p>
        <p>But most biotechnology stocks moved higher.</p>
        <p>Amgen closed at $69.06, up $1.81. Genentech gained $6, to $171. Chiron rose $1.63, to $50.13. And Millennium Pharmaceuticals closed at $115.14, up $3.20.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Mixed</p>
        <p>By Bloomberg News</p>
        <p>Bond prices were mixed yesterday after Federal Reserve policy makers left interest rates unchanged and warned about the risks of faster inflation.</p>
        <p>Treasuries did not get a lasting bounce because ''the Fed hasn't uncovered its next move,'' said William Fitzgerald of Nuveen Investments in Chicago. Still, investors may buy on the notion that the Fed is near the end of its cycle of rate increases, even if it is not finished, he said.</p>
        <p>''Many investors believe the Fed usually raises rates one time too many,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The 10-year note rose 1/32, to 99 27/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.77 percent from 5.78 percent. The 30-year bond slipped 2/32, to 107 22/32. Its yield was unchanged at 5.71 percent.</p>
