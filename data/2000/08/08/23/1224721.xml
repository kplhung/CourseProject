        <p>Rejecting the recommendation of a top Justice Department investigator, Attorney General Janet Reno has decided not to name a special prosecutor to investigate Vice President Al Gore's political fund-raising in 1996, government officials said.</p>
        <p>The head of the department's campaign finance unit, Robert J. Conrad, told Ms. Reno in June that she should appoint a special counsel to investigate whether Mr. Gore had been truthful with investigators.</p>
        <p>But the officials said that Ms. Reno had apparently sided with others in the department who argued against choosing a special prosecutor, a move that would have given momentum to the criminal inquiry just as Mr. Gore's presidential campaign enters the final months.
