        <p>For Sid and Kristanne Heaton, ''manifest destiny'' first called in spring 1997. Recently engaged, the couple discovered that they had an entire unplanned summer before she was to begin a master's program at the University of Washington. Hoping to see more of the United States and Canada, the couple hopped into their Volkswagen camper for three months of touring, all while he telecommuted full time as a technical writer for a California software company.</p>
        <p>Thirty-six states, two provinces and a wedding later, the couple took their lust for working-while-traveling to Europe, in March 1999, after Mrs. Heaton was accepted in an art history program in Rome. Over the next 12 months, Mr. Heaton continued to telecommute for his employer. But he and his wife also managed to live in five countries, see seven others and post their travels online at www.officeodyssey.com.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the world of the extreme telecommuter, a term that Mr. Heaton says he coined to describe people like himself who hold down full-time salaried positions, complete with benefits, and yet are no ordinary 9-to-5, cubicle-inhabiting drones. The goal of an extreme telecommuter, he says, is to happily blur the line between working and having an adventure, whether it is touring Europe, scaling a mountain or pedaling a recumbent bike across the United States.</p>
        <p>Extreme telecommuters are not bleary-eyed corporate road warriors nor are they garden-variety telecommuters who work from home. Nevertheless, they maintain they are no less dedicated to their jobs. Mr. Heaton, for example, said that he had managed to get bonuses and raises as an extreme telecommuter.</p>
        <p>Such telecommuters are still rare. According to workplace experts, few jobs -- let alone employers -- lend themselves to such potentially chaotic mobility. Still, some experts suspect that the ranks of extreme telecommuters may slowly swell the next few years, especially if the labor market remains tight and mobile computing and wireless technology continue to bolt along.</p>
        <p>''This is the kind of thing that so many people go through life saying -- if only I had followed my wanderlust,'' said Gil Gordon of Monmouth Junction, N.J., a telecommuting consultant who counsels employers.</p>
        <p>Michael Fuchs is certainly following his impulse to travel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fuchs, a former Time Warner executive, is now the chairman of Autobytel.com, an online auto retailer based in Irvine, Calif. But he is also the interim chief executive of MyTurn.com, an e-commerce products and services company in Alameda, Calif. Mr. Fuchs has an office in New York but often works elsewhere -- Brazil, New Guinea or, every February, Hawaii.</p>
        <p>''Travel is a real passion,'' he said. ''I was at Time for 20 years, and when I left, I told myself I would have a life.''</p>
        <p>Such sentiments do not surprise Tom Miller, vice president for Internet strategies at Cyber Dialogue, a technology research firm in Manhattan. ''When we first studied telecommuting in 1984, it was a pretty structured thing,'' Mr. Miller said. ''But telecommuting has unfolded in much more of a guerrilla warfare fashion, driven more by individual, rather than corporate, needs.''</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T is one company that says it is becoming increasingly open to variations on traditional telecommuting. ''The shift we're seeing is one where work becomes much more integrated into the fabric of your life, but in a way that's manageable,'' said Brad Allenby, who oversees the company's so-called telework efforts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allenby said that 25 percent of his company's managers worked from outside the office one or more times a week, and 10 percent worked from virtual offices, at home or elsewhere. ''I've got a manager who reports directly to me -- she's in a virtual office in Ohio -- but she has family in Las Vegas,'' he said. ''Do I care if she's in a cafe in Paris? No, I don't.''</p>
        <p>Stephanie Berg appreciates that kind of latitude and has adopted what could be considered a subset of extreme telecommuting. She lives in Bethesda, Md., but works as a computer programmer and data processor for a public opinion polling company in Colorado. Every six weeks, Ms. Berg hits the road for a week with her four-and-a-half-pound notebook computer and cell phone to visit a large network of college friends who live as far away as California.</p>
        <p>Still, extreme telecommuting is not always one happy road trip. Phil Montero, an independent consultant in North Andover, Mass., who trains mobile workers (his Web site is www.youcanworkfromanywhere .com), estimates that only about a third of employers give their mobile telecommuters any training to work outside of the office, and that only half of those workers have thorough training in the technology.</p>
        <p>But Gail Martin, executive director of the International Telework Association and Council, says extreme telecommuting can also raise potentially confounding liability issues. What happens, she asks, if a telecommuter falls while mountain climbing or bike riding? Also, who is responsible for the equipment and the security of information?</p>
        <p>Despite the drawbacks, extreme telecommuters are thrilled with their choices.</p>
        <p>The Heatons, for example, estimate that in their two telecommuting sojourns they managed to do more traveling than they would have in 15 years of conventional vacations, even though it also meant that Mr. Heaton had to endure hardships like sending  early morning e-mails from Polish truck stops and having teleconferences from a piazza in Rome. He is now telecommuting from Nevada City, Calif., a tiny town in the Sierra Nevada foothills. But the Heatons are thinking of spending the winter in Hawaii. ''We don't want having a career to get in the way of having a life,'' he said in an e-mail message.</p>
