        <p>WHILE there are plenty of sponsors at the United States Open tennis tournament, which begins on Monday, one sponsor intends to stand out -- quite literally -- among visitors to Flushing Meadows in Queens, where the event is held.</p>
        <p>Starting on Sept. 1, Lincoln Mercury, the Ford Motor unit based in Irvine, Calif., will usher visitors through elaborately staged exhibits in a pavilion the size of four tennis courts to promote a more contemporary image.</p>
        <p>In creating the unusual exhibits,  Lincoln is embracing a new idea in marketing called experience marketing, made popular in books like ''The Experience Economy,'' by B. Joseph Pine and James H. Gilmore (Harvard Business School Press, 1999). Companies using this technique offer consumers an experience beyond just selling a product. Retail stores like Niketown and restaurants like Hard Rock Cafe have gone this route.</p>
        <p>Deborah Wahl, Lincoln Mercury's marketing communications manager, said Lincoln was intrigued with the ideas. ''The message in the experience economy is to combine education with sensory experience and entertainment,'' Ms. Wahl said. ''We took that cue, and made it relevant to Lincoln.''</p>
        <p>The Lincoln American Luxury Immersion exhibit is part of the automaker's strategy to align itself with its belief that there is a new idea of American luxury. Based on consumer research, the company describes the new luxury as casual, energetic and optimistic. One example: a generation ago, a nice evening might have included driving a Lincoln to a formal restaurant where diners had to dress accordingly and use the right fork, Ms. Wahl said. Today, Lincoln's key consumer audience -- drivers 30 to 50 years old -- would probably prefer skewering jumbo shrimp on an expensive grill while dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, with -- Lincoln would hope -- a Lincoln Navigator in the driveway.</p>
        <p>''It boils down to luxury without rules,'' Ms. Wahl said. ''It fits into the new trend. All the new affluence is redefining how we define luxury; it's a different way of approaching it.''</p>
        <p>The Lincoln pavilion, situated inside the grounds' former indoor tennis courts, is a series of interactive sensory experiences that juxtaposes old versus new definitions of luxury. Upon walking into the pavilion, for instance, visitors will experience the sights and sounds of tennis from the past with real grass courts, still photography from the 1940's and 50's and video and audio evoking that era, followed by the sights and sounds of today's much more causal and energetic United States Open. In the last stage of the exhibit, Lincoln unveils its newest vehicle, a sporty truck called the Blackwood.</p>
        <p>Impiric, the customer relationship unit of Young &amp; Rubicam in Irvine, Calif., is overseeing the project for Lincoln. ''It's very much like building a set, it's a cross between Broadway and a sound stage,'' said Allan Finehirsh Sr., vice president-director for event marketing and promotions, at Impiric.</p>
        <p>The Lincoln exhibit is the largest ever at the Open, said Pierce O'Neil, chief marketing officer for the United States Tennis Association, the nonprofit group that owns and operates the Open. Lincoln recently signed a five-year agreement as exclusive sponsor of the U.S.T.A., making it the exclusive auto sponsor and a year-round sponsor of USA League Tennis, the world's largest recreational tennis league. Lincoln will run commercials during the Open on CBS and USA Cable.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neil said the sponsorship was a perfect match for the association. After reaching a peak in popularity in the early 1980's, fan interest waned and the Open's television ratings declined. But in the last few years, the U.S.T.A. has been working to attract a younger, more diverse crowd. The group believes it is in the early stages of a resurgence: ratings climbed in 1998 and this year it began attracting a range of sponsors, from newcomers like Lincoln and Elle magazine to longtime supporters like Heineken and Fila.</p>
        <p>''There are many similarities between the demographics, but it's more about the image,'' Mr. O'Neil said of the Lincoln sponsorship. ''Optimistic, inviting, friendly -- those are all words and concepts that Lincoln uses and those are words and phrases that certainly describe the Open.''</p>
        <p>But Jack Trout, a marketing consultant and author in Greenwich, Conn., said Lincoln had a way to go to change its image. ''What's undermining their image is that the biggest way you experience the Lincoln is when you are going to the airport,'' Mr. Trout said. ''They kind of dominate the limo market, and to me that is a big factor in their image problem.''</p>
        <p>Even so, Lincoln sales are up this year because of its newer vehicles, the sporty LS, and the Navigator, a sport utility vehicle. According to J. D. Power &amp; Associates, a market research firm in Agoura Hills, Calif., Lincoln sold 101,024 vehicles in the year ended June 30, compared with 81,131 a year earlier.</p>
        <p>To attract visitors to the exhibit, Lincoln will begin running teaser ads today from Young &amp; Rubicam that ask questions like ''Have you heard about it?'' and ''Are you living it?'' Ads will also appear throughout the 50-acre Flushing Meadows site.</p>
        <p>But not all of Lincoln's efforts to attract visitors are contemporary.  Lincoln possesses one of the oldest summertime marketing ploys. Immersion, Ms. Wahl said, is the only site open to all visitors that has air- conditioning -- a fact the company will not advertise but the knowledge is sure to spread, especially if temperatures rise during the event.</p>
