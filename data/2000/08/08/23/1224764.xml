        <p>The first pitch  rainbowed in at 47 miles an hour  he said it was his eephus pitch -- and Joe Vitiello let it go by. Nobody in professional baseball had ever seen this pitcher, and there was no scouting report.</p>
        <p>The next pitch came in at 78, also for a ball, then Vitiello took a strike. With a 3-1 count, he could not resist a 79-mile-an-hour heater, pulling it down the left-field line, just foul. Finally, ball four came in at 66 m.p.h. Say this for Derek Bell, the Mets' mop-up man in a 16-1 loss today to the San Diego Padres: He knows how to change speeds.</p>
        <p>Bell allowed five runs in the eighth inning, though one was unearned, coming on a dropped pop-up by catcher Todd Pratt. When Vitiello popped out to end the inning, Bell lifted his cap to the Qualcomm Stadium fans, who saluted him. It was absurd, and appropriate, for a crazy day at the park.</p>
        <p>Bell, an outfielder, became only the third position player in Mets history to pitch. As bad as his inning was -- five runs, three hits, three walks -- Pat Mahomes had two that were worse. Bell needed 36 pitches to get through the eighth; Mahomes, filling in for the injured Mike Hampton, threw 34 in the second and 43 in the third. He allowed five runs in each of those innings.</p>
        <p>Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza had the day off, and Bell, another starter, was also supposed to be resting. But the game became a lost cause early, and with the Mets trailing, 10-1, in the fourth inning, Bell volunteered to be Manager Bobby Valentine's emergency pitcher.</p>
        <p>''It's every player's dream to pitch,'' Pratt said, ''no matter what the circumstance is.''</p>
        <p>For Bell, the circumstance arose in the eighth inning, after Valentine had used the relievers Turk Wendell, John Franco and Armando Benitez for an inning apiece. Rick White and Dennis Cook had worked two innings each in the 5-4, 10-inning loss Monday night and were unavailable (though White appeared as a pinch-hitter). So Bell came on in the eighth, tossing with an easy motion.</p>
        <p>Bell wore sunglasses as he pitched -- ''I was sweating all over my glasses; I couldn't see home plate,'' he said -- and his first pitch was the eephus, the parabolic pitch Rip Sewell made famous in the 1940's and Bill Lee used in the 70's. ''Like throwing it to a little kid, I was just floating it up there,'' Bell said. He threw that pitch and a fastball, no breaking stuff or knuckleballs.</p>
        <p>Bell admitted he thought of Jose Canseco, the slugger who needed elbow surgery in 1993 after a one-inning stint on the mound for Texas. Bell is important to the Mets, and when Pratt greeted Bell on the mound, he told him not to hurt himself. ''Let's get this game over with,'' Pratt said.</p>
        <p>If Bell threw as hard as he could, he figures, he could touch 90 miles an hour. Bell, a pitcher in high school, thinks he could throw even harder if he conditioned himself the way pitchers do. But he kept most pitches in the mid-70's, cranking it up only when his fellow Tampa, Fla., native Dave Magadan batted.</p>
        <p>Bell's fastball peaked at 87 miles an hour, and he was proud of it. ''I know y'all don't see a position player come out there and throw 87,'' he told reporters.</p>
        <p>Magadan, who singled, was not surprised at Bell's arm strength -- but not amused. ''It's a no-win situation,'' Magadan said. ''He didn't take it seriously, lobbing balls in at 40 miles per hour. It's never fun doing that, especially for a guy like me who doesn't really get in there that often. To face someone who's kind of joking around is not a lot of fun.''</p>
        <p>The game itself was no fun for the Mets, and the lighthearted ending did nothing to soften the mood. After Bell's third walk, Valentine came to the mound and considered using Todd Zeile to pitch. Bell began to exchange gloves with Zeile -- first base would have been his second new position of the inning -- but Valentine left him on the mound.</p>
        <p>''I think if he had gotten them out 1-2-3, it might have been a little more mood-breaking,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Mahomes set the mood with a performance he accurately described as terrible. No Mets starter in three years had allowed 10 runs in a start, but Mahomes did today, and his day spiraled out of control quickly. With two outs and two runners on in the second, Mahomes walked Wiki Gonzalez to bring up the pitcher, the rookie Adam Eaton.</p>
        <p>Eaton is a good hitter, the only pitcher in the National League with 30 at-bats and a .300 average, and he fouled off two pitches with a 2-2 count. Mahomes lost the battle, walking Eaton to force in a run.</p>
        <p>His next pitch was a high fastball to Damian Jackson, who pounded it into the left-field bleachers for a grand slam. Padres 5, Mets 0, with more to come.</p>
        <p>After a leadoff walk in the third, Mahomes surrendered back-to-back home runs into the second deck at Qualcomm, a perch reached only by Mark McGwire this season and just 14 times by the Padres in the park's 32-year history. The rout was on.</p>
        <p>''It kept snowballing,'' said Mahomes, who struggled with command of his breaking ball and fastball. ''Every ball was either in the gap or a 400-foot home run. I just didn't do my job today.''</p>
        <p>Mahomes allowed 10 runs on seven hits, walking five in four innings; he has 57 walks in 80 1/3 innings. He will be unavailable for the next several days, and the Mets considered promoting a relief pitcher from the minors after the game, before leaving the roster as is.</p>
        <p>They will hope Al Leiter gives them a lengthy outing Wednesday before a much-needed day off Thursday. The bullpen needs a break, and Bell knew it when he made his offer.</p>
        <p>''We're in the race, and we need those guys,'' Bell said. ''For me to go out there and save those guys' arms, it's going to benefit me in the long run, because I get to play behind them and they can stay strong and stay healthy.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>MIKE HAMPTON, who left his start last Thursday with a stress fracture in his right ribs, threw on flat ground Tuesday and will do so again on Wednesday. He will throw in a bullpen session on Friday. . . . Catcher MIKE PIAZZA has a sore hip and a bruised shin, the result of a rolling catch on Sunday and a hard slide on Monday, but Manager BOBBY VALENTINE said he was fine.</p>
