        <p>After 13 weeks in which it became not only a huge television hit, but also a real cultural phenomenon, ''Survivor,'' the CBS summer reality program, comes to an end tonight with a special, two-hour finale.</p>
        <p>During this evening's program, one of the four contestants who still remain in the competition on the Southern Pacific island of Pulau Tiga will survive a vote by his or her island compatriots to win a $1 million prize.</p>
        <p>The final episode of ''Survivor'' will be the culmination of a stunning run in which it smashed ratings records, drew an audience much younger than the one CBS normally does and turned many of its original 16 castaways into  stars. It has also launched a host of imitators that are to be shown on other networks.</p>
        <p>As its castaways competed with each other under harsh island conditions in which they dodged snakes, ate rats and bugs and built their own shelters, ''Survivor'' became one of the few programs that tens of millions of people made a point of being home for.</p>
        <p>Considering competition from the Internet and cable, that is a rare feat for television, let alone during the lazy days of summer, when viewing levels are at their lowest.</p>
        <p>As of last week, ''Survivor'' was the most-watched series to be shown during the summer in television history. Since its May 31 debut, it has been watched by a weekly average of 24.5 million people.</p>
        <p>Its audience has steadily grown. The first episode was watched by 15.5 million people. Last Wednesday, ''Survivor'' was watched by 28.7 million. That episode's household audience was 23 percent larger than the combined household audience of its five broadcast network competitors combined. For CBS, the show's household rating was more than double the one for an episode of ''Martial Law'' that ran during the same time period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>''Survivor's'' ratings have even dwarfed last summer's ratings of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the ABC game show with Regis Philbin as host that took the television world by surprise last August by drawing an average audience of 14.3 million people. (Now 'Millionaire' draws close to 20 million viewers on a regular basis.)</p>
        <p>CBS would not estimate how large its audience would be tonight. But the program is widely expected to draw its largest audience yet. That expectation has allowed CBS to sell 30-second advertisement spots for $600,000 each, more than those on ''E.R.,'' NBC's top-rated hospital drama.</p>
        <p>And CBS is apparently doing all it can to ensure that the sponsors of tonight's finale are not disappointed, with much of today's schedule devoted to the program.</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' will factor heavily in the ''Early Show,'' with Bryant Gumbel as host, and CBS's  ''Late Show With David Letterman.''</p>
        <p>At 7:30 p.m., CBS will run a half-hour ''Survivor'' preview special on many of its owned and affiliated stations. The ''Survivor'' finale will itself be shown from 8 to 10 p.m. It will be followed by a one-hour special in which Mr. Gumbel will interview the 16 original contestants.</p>
        <p>That Mr. Gumbel will be host of the special reflects the show's phenomenal status. Mr. Gumbel is an employee of CBS News, yet ''Survivor'' is managed by CBS's entertainment division.</p>
        <p>Girding for criticism that CBS is blurring the line between entertainment and news, executives pointed out that plot twists were being treated as legitimate news by other media organizations throughout the nation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gumbel's role in the program has raised some eyebrows within CBS News as well as in  other network news divisions, especially because the special is being directed by the two men who direct his morning program. What's more, it is being produced by a former producer of ''Early Show.''</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' has often been featured by ABC's ''Good Morning America'' and NBC's ''Today'' and has been the focus of the covers of Time and Newsweek. Some newspapers have followed developments on the program the way they would any other news.</p>
        <p>''News is partly what interests people, and you can't be above the news,'' said Steve Friedman, the executive producer of Mr. Gumbel's ''Early Show.'' ''This is what America's talking about.''</p>
        <p>''Early Show,'' a production of CBS News, has seen its own ratings fortunes grow along with those of ''Survivor'' by interviewing contestants and running features on the program. This morning it will again focus heavily on ''Survivor,'' with profiles of the remaining contestants and a recap of the program's highlights. Yesterday's ''Early Show''  also included segments about ''Survivor,'' including one in which a professional social planner doled out advice for those who are giving parties celebrating the program's finale.</p>
        <p>One reason ''Survivor'' has been able to hold that kind of audience interest is because the identity of the winner has been closely guarded and has not leaked to the press.</p>
        <p>Of the 16 contestants who initially began competing on the island, four are left. They are: Richard Hatch, 39, a corporate trainer from Rhode Island; Kelly, 23, a white-water guide from Las Vegas; Rudy Boesch, 72, a retired Navy Seal; and Susan Hawk, 38, a truck driver from Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>CBS had hoped to build on ''Survivor's'' success with ''Big Brother,'' another reality show in which contestants are forced to cope with each other in a fabricated house. As in ''Survivor,'' contestants vote each other off the program. The last person remaining when the program concludes next month will collect a cash prize of $500,000.</p>
        <p>But it has not enjoyed comparablesuccess. Although it has often done better for CBS than other shows that have run during its time periods a year ago -- especially among younger people -- it is in no way considered a runaway hit. ''Big Brother'' has been criticized for lacking the sort of personal dynamics featured in ''Survivor,'' which is often praised by critics for a good mesh of strong personalities, including Mr. Hatch, the corporate trainer who openly plots with fellow contestants and has paraded on the beach naked.</p>
        <p>'Nightly News' Change</p>
        <p>NBC News has named a new executive producer for ''Nightly News with Tom Brokaw,'' which had been without one last month when David Doss departed for what were said to be opportunities in new media.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brokaw's new producer is Jonathan Wald, who was the senior producer for the program. It is said that Mr. Wald has news in his blood. His father is Richard C. Wald, a longtime senior vice president at ABC News.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Wald is taking over at a good time for the program, which has been gaining against its closest competitor, ABC News's ''World News Tonight.'' For the week of August 14-18, the NBC program was watched by 9.65 million people and the ABC program by 8.2 million.</p>
