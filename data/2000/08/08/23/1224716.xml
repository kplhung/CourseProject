        <p>Invoking the legacy of the suffragists at every turn, Hillary Rodham Clinton sought today to portray herself as a champion of women and working families and to bolster her support in this city, where Susan B. Anthony once fought for the right to vote.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic Senate candidate, toured Anthony's red-brick home, boasted of her own efforts to promote women's issues like breast cancer and child care, and even appeared with Ruth Dyk, 99, who once marched alongside the suffragists and likened Mrs. Clinton to them. ''If I've learned one thing, it's this: New York needs a woman's touch,'' Ms. Dyk said while endorsing Mrs. Clinton.</p>

        <p>Invoking the legacy of the suffragists at every turn, Hillary Rodham Clinton sought today to portray herself as a champion of women and working families and to bolster her support in this city, where Susan B. Anthony once fought for the right to vote.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic Senate candidate, toured Anthony's red-brick home, boasted of her own efforts to promote women's issues like breast cancer and child care, and even appeared with Ruth Dyk, 99, who once marched alongside the suffragists and likened Mrs. Clinton to them. ''If I've learned one thing, it's this: New York needs a woman's touch,'' Ms. Dyk said while endorsing Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>In her latest campaign swing through Monroe County, a key electoral county, Mrs. Clinton seemed determined to show women that she was their candidate. At a meeting with union members, she said she was a working mother like many of those in the room. ''I know what it's like when you have to worry about whether or not you're going to make it to that school play because you're in one of those interminable meetings,'' she said to laughter and clapping.</p>
        <p>Some polls have shown Mrs. Clinton in trouble with various pockets of women who vote, particularly white women, and she has sought out issues to shore up support. At the same time, her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, has aggressively pursued these same groups of voters. Just last week, for example, he visited the Women's Rights National Historic Park in Seneca Falls, the birthplace of the women's suffrage movement.</p>
        <p>Although she never mentioned Mr. Lazio by name, Mrs. Clinton today repeatedly tried to distinguish herself by stressing her plan for economic development in upstate New York and her support of issues traditionally important to women, like education and health care. She also advocated a woman's right to abortion, and further pledged that she would never vote to confirm a judge who would try to make abortion illegal. ''I want you to know my opponent does not have the same view of reality, the same vision of the future, the same positions on the issues,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also supports the right to an abortion but is opposed to a form of late-term abortion and is against public financing for abortions.</p>
        <p>Despite Mrs. Clinton's efforts to focus on substantive issues, several women continued to bring up personal details about President Clinton's extramarital affair in the White House that led to his impeachment.</p>
        <p>Linda Lowenstein, a registered nurse, said that she intended to vote for Mrs. Clinton but that many of the women who are her friends would not. ''I think the issue is the problems with Bill,'' she said. ''I think, unfortunately, some women can't forgive her for not leaving him.''</p>
        <p>Nora Bredes, director of the Susan B. Anthony Center for Women's Leadership at the University of Rochester, said that Mrs. Clinton's candidacy might make some women uncomfortable because it reflects their own struggles to be both leaders and nurturers in a modern world.</p>
        <p>And while Mrs. Clinton was surrounded by a number of women today, some of her most effusive supporters were men. Dominic Noto, a retired railroad worker, could not wait to line up at the Marketplace Mall to shake her hand. ''She's a strong woman, because she stuck by him,'' he said. ''A lot of people wouldn't have had the courage and the strength. I told her that four years from now, I'll vote for her for the White House.''</p>
