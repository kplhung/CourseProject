        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: ROYAL PEACE TRIP  On the first visit to Israel by an Arab leader since the failed Camp David talks, King Abdullah II of Jordan met Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, left, and Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Arab diplomats said the king's aim was to try to find common ground on the issue of Jerusalem, but the talks appeared to have produced no break in the impasse. It was the second meeting between the king and Mr. Barak in a week; the two also held talks in Amman.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: 23 HELD AS TERRORISTS  Israeli and Palestinian security officials have arrested 23 Arabs suspected of planning a series of terror attacks to disrupt peace efforts, and said at least one suspect had links to Osama bin Laden, the F.B.I.'s most wanted terrorist suspect. Security officials said the arrests, over three months, involved radicals with links to the Hamas and Islamic Holy War groups in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as the Al-Qaeda movement led by Mr. bin Laden.</p>

        <p>IRAN: DROUGHT HITS 37 MILLION  The drought that has devastated large areas of southern and western Asia, from India to the Middle East, has affected 37 million people in Iran, a United Nations relief official said. Vladimir Sakharov, who toured Iran for 17 days with a team from Unicef, the World Health Organization and the office of the United Nations coordinator for humanitarian affairs, said drinking water was scarce and many people had lost crops and livestock for the second year.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: AWOL OFFICER LEAVES  A United States Army Reserve intelligence officer who was declared absent without leave in Israel returned to the United States, still insisting that he was not a spy. Lt. Col. Jeremiah Mattysse, 50, denied that he had fled a Texas intelligence unit with secret information. He was to be taken to Fort Knox, Ky.</p>

        <p>PERU: ARMS RING UNCOVERED  The government announced the uncovering of an international arms trafficking ring that smuggled 10,000 assault rifles from Jordan to the Amazonian jungles of Peru for final delivery to Marxist guerrillas fighting in Colombia. Six people were arrested, including two Peruvian military officers.</p>

        <p>ARGENTINA: BRIBERY INQUIRY  President Fernando de la Rua promised to cooperate fully with an investigation into charges that a labor reform bill he proposed passed the Senate in April after opposition senators received bribes and other personal favors. Several officials, including the labor minister, have decided to volunteer for questioning by prosecutors.</p>

        <p>JAPAN, NORTH KOREA: ROCKY TALKS  Japanese and North Korean negotiators vowed to try to set up diplomatic ties, but hopes for a breakthrough looked dim as the longtime foes stuck to entrenched positions on key issues. On the first of two days of talks in Tokyo, North Korea repeated its call for Japan to apologize and pay reparations for its 1910-45 rule over the Korean Peninsula. Japan replied by raising the issue of 10 Japanese citizens Tokyo believes were kidnapped by North Korean agents.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: REVEALING PREMIER'S PAST  A court decided to ask the police to make public whether or not they apprehended Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori in a brothel more than 40 years ago -- a report by a weekly magazine that Mr. Mori has denied. News organizations said the Tokyo District Court, holding hearings on a suit filed by Mr. Mori against the magazine, Truth of the Rumor, had made the unusual decision in response to a request by the magazine's lawyers.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: LIBYA INCREASES RANSOM  Libya has agreed to pay $1 million for each of the 12 foreign hostages held by Muslim rebels in the southern Philippines since April 23, clearing the way for their release ''fairly soon,'' officials close to the negotiations said. The hostages were to have been freed last weekend but the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas delayed the release after Libya haggled to lower the ransom to $700,000 per captive, according to the officials.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>MONGOLIA: HELD IN '98 MURDER  The police have detained a leading opposition politician, Erdeniin Bat-Uul, as a suspect in the 1998 murder of the country's leading democracy figure, Mr. Bat-Uul's wife, Delgertuyaa, said. She said her husband had first been arrested on charges of disturbing public order but then prosecutors said he was being held as a suspect in the murder of Sanjaasurengiin Zorig, minister of infrastructure development.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>BURUNDI: PEACE TRIP OFF  President Pierre Buyoya, left, canceled a trip to South Africa and a meeting with Nelson Mandela, and instead focused on calming Tutsi opposition to a peace accord intended to end the country's civil war, which started in 1993. Tensions between Hutu and minority Tutsi have increased as an Aug. 28 deadline neared for signing a power-sharing pact. Mr. Mandela, the former South African president, has been mediating talks and has invited President Clinton to witness the ceremony.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>LIBERIA: BRITISH TV CREW HELD  A judge rejected a request to grant bail to a British television crew charged with spying, saying the accusations were too grave. Two Britons, a Sierra Leonean and a South African say they were working on a documentary for Channel Four in Britain, where Foreign Office minister Peter Hain called the arrests ''an attack on international press freedom.'' Liberia says the crew was trying to link President Charles Taylor to diamond smuggling and gun-running in Sierra Leone.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>BRITAIN: PIG BAN NARROWED  The European Union recommended the narrowing of a ban on importing live pigs from England to cover only animals from an area in southeast England where an outbreak of swine fever is said to have been contained. A European panel said there had been no new reports of the disease in Suffolk, Norfolk and Essex since Aug. 12. The United States has also banned English pork products and China said it would do the same.</p>
