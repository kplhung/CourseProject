        <p>StarMedia, one of the biggest and most successful Internet companies in Latin America, has branch offices in seven countries and millions of subscribers throughout the region. But its headquarters are in New York. Its $450 million in financing came from investors in the United States. Its stock is listed on the Nasdaq but not on any exchange in Latin America.</p>
        <p>El Sitio, another Internet service provider with millions of Spanish-  and Portugese-speaking users in Latin America, also raised money by selling shares on the Nasdaq. But El Sitio is not traded on any stock exchange in the region where it does most of its business.</p>
        <p>And when Yupi Internet Inc. raised start-up money, it too bypassed local financial markets in the Latin American countries it serves, seeking investors in the United States instead. Yupi's plans for further expansion through a stock offering were postponed in April when the Nasdaq nose dived, but the company intends to sell shares to the public only in the United States, not Latin America.</p>
        <p>The Internet revolution has definitely come to Latin America. But whether the businesses and jobs created by that revolution have helped the region begin to wean itself from economic dependence on the United States and other outsiders is considered a matter of debate.</p>
        <p>''This keeps us more dependent on outsiders all the time, but the fault is ours,'' said Paul Singer, a professor of macroeconomics at the University of Sao Paulo. ''It is a deficiency which should be resolved.''</p>
        <p>Companies like StarMedia and El Sitio contend that they are not only truly Latin American but also helping create a pan-Latin market because Latin America's 500 million people are their main audience. These companies also say they would not even exist if they had sought to raise start-up money in the countries where their customers live and work.</p>
        <p>But critics contend that these companies have unwittingly helped create a kind of cybercolonialism in which the major architects of the region's Internet access are foreigners, backed by foreign funds, with offices in foreign lands, just like in the old days.</p>
        <p>There is widespread agreement that the remote-control companies and off-shore financing that made them possible underscore the persistent weakness of Latin America's financial world.</p>
        <p>''Yes, we do have a dependency on the more sophisticated foreign equity markets,'' said Jorge Errazuriz a partner in Celfin, one of Chile's largest investment banks, and a member of the board of the Santiago Stock Exchange. This ''inferior position,'' he said, means that ''the real initial impulse for developing fiber optics, telecommunications and the Internet will have to come from the equity markets up north.''</p>
        <p>It is not just start-up companies that are diverting strength from the domestic stock exchanges and extending dependency. When an aggressive international corporation like Telefonica of Spain purchases phone systems in Argentina, Brazil and Peru, it deprives local exchanges of some of their biggest companies. After such acquisitions, the local companies are removed from the domestic stock exchanges, while Telefonica stock is listed only in Spain and the United States.</p>
        <p>The Latin American exchanges have been hit hard. Over the last decade, for example, the number of listed domestic companies on Brazil's main exchange dropped about 18 percent, from 581 to 478. In Argentina the decline was even steeper, nearly 30 percent, with local companies on the exchange dipping to 129 from 179.</p>
        <p>''It's very troubling to see these markets, which are already weak, get weakened further,'' said Roger S. Leeds, director of the Center for International Business and Public Policy at the Paul H. Nitzke Center for International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. ''And I don't think that's at all healthy for the development of the private sector.''</p>
        <p>From Mexico to Argentina, political leaders in the new Latin America have promised to improve the standards of living in their countries by unleashing private enterprise and completely engaging in the global economy. But while the biggest Latin companies already have access to the money they need to expand on either the local or international markets, small and start-up companies, which generate most new jobs, often face an impossible dream.</p>
        <p>Even when local money is available, taking a company public on a Latin American exchange can be more trouble than it is worth. Most local exchanges lack the pool of capital and investors willing to take the kind of risks a big regional Internet company needs to start up. Besides, some require years of operating experience before a company's stock can be publicly traded, and in some instances they must show real profits, which few Internet start-ups are able to do.</p>
        <p>Latin America's economic development has always depended heavily on outsiders. Big corporations -- many of them from the United States -- set up branch plants in Central and South America that provided jobs and some growth. But they did little to develop a financial and economic self-sufficiency.</p>
        <p>The newest Latin American companies operate, in effect, the same way, critics like Professor Leeds contend. ''There are benefits to the local economy in terms of jobs and investment,'' he said. ''But the benefits to the local financial sector are zero.''</p>
        <p>Coming to the United States to raise money is not unique to Latin America, not even for Internet companies. Jesse E. Reyes, vice president for global product management for Venture Economics, a private equity research firm, said that Israeli and French Internet and software companies had raised generous amounts of capital on Wall Street lately.</p>
        <p>The difference, he said, is that they enter the United States market not just to raise money but to sell their products and services here. Their growth then translates into profit that is repatriated and re-invested in their home countries.</p>
        <p>The Latin companies that raise money here, by contrast, are not doing that.</p>
        <p>''If you look at it from the Latin American businessman's point of view, if they can take American money and get in on the ground floor of a terrific opportunity, then so what does it matter?'' Mr. Reyes said. ''But the sociologists might say, 'Isn't this just another example of American colonialism?' ''</p>
        <p>The companies that have successfully crossed borders to raise funds certainly do not see it that way.</p>
        <p>''What our inability to raise capital in Latin America says is that you cannot shift 500 years of monopoly control and monopoly orientation all at one time,'' said Fernando Espuelas, chairman of StarMedia. ''Until very recently, if you wanted to finance a company in Latin America you got a bank loan, at 30 percent interest, and for a very short term. Obviously you'd never be able to finance an Internet company that way.''</p>
        <p>Born in Uruguay and raised in Connecticut, Mr. Espuelas realized early on that Latin American investors, especially wary of risk, would not support his dream of creating a regional Internet company.</p>
        <p>Basing his company in New York reinforced its identity as truly regional, Mr. Espuelas said, and giving it an English name helped win over American investors. He knocked on the doors of nearly 50 American venture capitalists. Even hearing a sophisticated New York financier refer to Latin America as ''that blob there below the Rio Grande'' did not dissuade him.</p>
        <p>With flawless English and a cool confidence, he won over big backers, including Chase Capital Partners, and raised nearly $100 million in private capital.</p>
        <p>Then in May 1999, StarMedia issued its initial public offering on the Nasdaq, raising $110 million. A subsequent offering in October raised another $200 million. StarMedia stock, which first sold for $15, escalated to more than $60 at its peak.</p>
        <p>The American investors who bought in early and sold at the peak enjoyed the kinds of gains that would have gone to Latin investors had it been possible for StarMedia to go public in Latin America.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espuelas said he was aware of the drawbacks but felt that the region could eventually overcome the cycle of dependency.</p>
        <p>''I'm already reinvesting money into companies in Latin America,'' he said, though he declined to name his investments. ''Our success is demonstrative of what can happen but also of the challenges and the road that remains to be travelled.''</p>
        <p>While small local companies will continue to struggle, StarMedia's early success set loose a herd of regional Latin companies that beat a similar path to the doors of American venture capitalists</p>
        <p>El Sitio, based in Buenos Aires,  raised $130 million in its public offering in December. Impsat Fiber Networks, an Argentine telecommunications company in Wilton Manors, Fla., went public on the Nasdaq with a $195 million offering in February.</p>
        <p>Guillermo Jofre, chief financial officer of Impsat, said the lack of adequate financing was one of the most severe limitations Latin America faced. ''Right now there's simply no significant amount of local financing available in Latin America,'' Mr. Jofre said. ''And this presents a big handicap when compared to most other countries.''</p>
        <p>But the global marketplace for capital has its drawbacks, too. Yupi Internet, a Latin American Internet service company based in Miami, planned to go public in the United States last spring. Then the Nasdaq crashed.</p>
        <p>''We filed our initial public offering in January and we were completing our road show on April 14, the day of the debacle,'' said Oscar Coen, president of Yupi. That day the Nasdaq lost 355 points, its worst session ever to end its worst week ever. Yupi may have been in some trouble anyway because it was comparatively late to a market already served by StarMedia, El Sitio and others. But when the Nasdaq went into a tailspin, the company's executives and backers changed plans.</p>
        <p>''We realized that it was in the best interest of the company to postpone the I.P.O. until there was a more favorable environment,'' Mr. Coen said.</p>
        <p>Like many other companies, both American and foreign, Yupi's I.P.O. remains postponed. The delay has meant that Yupi has not expanded as rapidly as originally planned, Mr. Coen said. Yupi will not open shop in Paraguay or Uruguay, while Chile, he said, ''is borderline.'' Yupi has also pared its advertising budget.</p>
        <p>America Online Latin America, a spinoff of the original America Online, is also finding it tough to raise money in the United States. The Latin venture between AOL and the Cisneros Group of Venezuela originally filed its initial public offering in January but had to wait until earlier this month to move ahead. The 25 million shares were sold at $8 each and raised $200 million for the company, which is based in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.</p>
        <p>Still, a long line of Latin American start-ups is waiting to make the trip to the United States. ''That is clearly the final objective for most of us,'' said Marcos E. Galperin, president of Mercado Libre, an Internet auction site in Latin America. He started his company less than a year ago, with American backing. One of his earliest investors was an American financier who addressed Mr. Galperin's M.B.A. class at Stanford University.</p>
        <p>''From day minus one on this project I knew we wanted to get funding in the U.S.,'' Mr. Galperin said. ''For us, it's a big stamp of approval.''</p>
