        <p>For five years, Gov. Mike Foster of Louisiana has made no secret of his contempt for the state's trial lawyers, calling them ''bad guys'' who played too large a role in picking judges and influencing legislation. He pushed through changes to Louisiana's legal system that reduced damage awards, and accused lawyers of driving jobs out of the state.</p>
        <p>But this morning, demonstrating the assured singularity that has become his trademark, the 70-year-old governor walked into a classroom at Southern University in Baton Rouge and began his first day of law school.</p>
        <p>''It's sort of a lifelong ambition,'' Mr. Foster explained to reporters.</p>
        <p>That ambition has been well-hidden from the public, which has watched with some amusement as the governor made his battles with lawyers a foundation of his successful campaigns for office in 1995 and 1999.</p>
        <p>''The trial lawyers always hide behind the working people, but they are the biggest enemy of the working people,'' Mr. Foster said last year. ''The lawyers will run business out of the state and that means they run jobs out of the state. They've done it before.''</p>
        <p>But Marsanne Golsby, Mr. Foster's press secretary, said the governor had been talking about studying law for years.</p>
        <p>''He likes a challenge, and he's had to put up with lawyers all of his professional life,'' Ms. Golsby said. ''It just eats at him that an area of expertise that he runs across, a big area of knowledge that's very very important, he doesn't know himself. He doesn't like it when they know something he doesn't.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Golsby said the governor would begin with three courses -- torts, civil procedure and legal writing -- and continue taking a half-load of courses as long as he had the time. She described him as ''a little nervous'' when he realized how much reading he would have to do, but said that he was willing to try it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foster has not said whether he would actually become a lawyer after his term expires in three years, but he does not appear to need the extra income. Before entering public office, he became a wealthy businessman with interests in construction and his family's sugar plantations. But several law-school graduates said he was welcome in their profession, hoping it might ease some of the tension between the two sides.</p>
        <p>''Increased education always allows people to make better decisions,'' said Sam N. Gregorio, president of the Louisiana Trial Lawyers Association. ''I applaud his intellectual interest.''</p>
