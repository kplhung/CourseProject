        <p>Once a month or so, John Engels, an executive coach in Rochester, takes some of his clients to Attica prison, home of many of the most violent felons in New York.</p>
        <p>This is not one of those ''Scared Straight'' encounters. But by experiencing the intense, sometimes raw talk of inmates, Mr. Engels hopes the executives can become better communicators and managers.</p>
        <p>Greg Fierle, chief operating officer of Cook Moving Systems in Cheektowaga, near Buffalo, said he was surprised at how much the experience had improved both his performance at the moving and storage company and his relationships with his family.</p>
        <p>''At Attica, the inmates don't let you get away without saying what you're really saying, without being open and clear,'' Mr. Fierle said. ''It made me eliminate as much gray as possible in what I say.''</p>
        <p>As a result of his experience at Attica, he said, ''I have learned to be much more clear in explaining what my expectations are'' to colleagues.</p>
        <p>And he has told them to let him know if he has not been clear enough. ''Now, if people do not understand exactly what I want, they probe until they get a perfectly clear understanding,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That was not at all what he anticipated when he agreed to accompany Mr. Engels to Attica. He looked on the prospect more as an adventure -- an opportunity to peek inside a world few see and many would rather not think about. Now, he said, he urges fellow executives to go for the lessons they can learn from convicts about straight talk.</p>
        <p>For Amy Tait, executive vice president of Home Properties, an apartment real estate investment trust based in Rochester, there was another lesson. In her visits to the prison, she said she was ''impressed how, in the most unlikely of places, you could find empathy and hope.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''If you can accomplish this with people in prison, imagine what you can do with people who have their freedom.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Engels compared the Attica experience to the corporate team-building exercises involved in river rafting and rappelling cliffs. The Attica encounters are sponsored by Cephas, a religious group in Buffalo formed after the Attica prison uprising in 1971 to help inmates that now finds itself also helping executives.</p>
        <p>On a recent visit, Mr. Engels, his clients and two Cephas workers were taken to a large room at Attica used for meetings to help prepare prisoners for release, a room with light blue walls, large windows and a stone floor polished to a fine sheen. The walls were festooned with slogans and ideas about self-esteem. ''If you want a better life for your children start with a better life for yourself,'' one stated.</p>
        <p>Soon the inmates arrived, and introduced themselves to the visitors. Mr. Engels noted that four other executives were unable to attend because of time pressures.</p>
        <p>That prompted Roger Weisser, an inmate in his 50's who has spent most of his adult life in prison for crimes committed while drinking, to declare that time management is a real problem for prisoners. His remark drew quizzical looks from the visitors. Rick Mainprize, who has put in 18 years on a sentence of 25 years to life, said Attica time was divided into three ''modules,'' and lining up to go from one activity to the next wastes a lot of time, leaving prisoners with little useful time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Engels said, ''It sounds to me like what you are saying is about time driven by structure, not pressure.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mainprize, his voice rising in anger, replied: ''Pressure? We aren't under pressure? We have to worry that the guy next to us may go off and start stabbing people -- and we don't have pressure?''</p>
        <p>''How are you going to deal with pressure when you get out?'' Mr. Engels shot back. ''Life out there is nuts. People are trying to cram so much into each day.''</p>
        <p>Other inmates joined in, comparing the time-management problems of executives and inmates, until Matt Lemon, who was convicted of murder, moved the discussion to what he said was a very real pressure on inmates -- their powerlessness when things go wrong back home.</p>
        <p>When his wife went to the hospital with a blood clot recently, Mr. Lemon said, ''I was totally lost, helpless.'' Prompted by one of the visitors to examine the reasons he found himself powerless, Mr. Lemon instead explained why he broke into houses. ''I was trying to compete with people who had things I didn't have.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Tait saw a connection in this confession. ''So you have a lack of control, and we have too much control,'' she said. ''We have too many things to do -- rush to the ballgame with our kids or return that call from the investor or finish that project I promised to charity -- which will it be? The way to deal with that is to think about the things you can control and forget about where you have no control. Think about deeper issues than time management and how to get through each day.''</p>
        <p>Time pressure, Mr. Engels added, ''keeps pushing me back to what's important.'' He told about his father's illness and death and his revulsion at his initial reaction. ''This sounds nuts, but I thought, 'I don't have time for my father to die right now.' ''</p>
        <p>Then it was the inmates' turn to look perplexed. ''Do a lot of people feel like that?'' Mr. Mainprize asked.</p>
        <p>''I made it sound hard-hearted,'' Mr. Engels explained. ''What's going on is a recognition that if I don't have time for stuff like my father when he's dying, then I'm not focused on what's important.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mainprize returned to his own concerns. ''Very little time in here is our own, but when we get out of here  when you see people who got out come back, the main problem is that they say they had too much time on the outside. When I get out and have that unstructured life . . .''</p>
        <p>Michael Oberst, a Franciscan brother who runs Cephas, jumped in. ''When you get out, if you have no demands on your time, it creates problems,'' he said. Having a job, family obligations and meetings to attend make productive use of time, he added.</p>
        <p>Soon, though, the discussion shifted again after Mr. Weisser said he worked 16-hour days before a violent crime sent him to prison for the third time. Ellis Stokely, 50, who has been behind bars since his robbery partner fled police custody and an ensuing shooting left one person dead 25 years ago, asked Mr. Weisser how, if he had worked so much, he had time to get into trouble.</p>
        <p>It was in his blood, Mr. Weisser replied with a shrug of his shoulders. He was bad, so he did bad things.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stokely was having none of it. A criminal can stop being a criminal if he changes his conduct, he suggested, and Mr. Weisser could start by asking himself a simple question: ''What's the hardest part of being honest?''</p>
