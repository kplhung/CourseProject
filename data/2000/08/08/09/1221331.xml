        <p>The fever has broken.</p>
        <p>Manhattan's over-the-top real estate market, on a fast roll for more than four years, has lost its frenzied upward momentum and seems to be cooling down.</p>
        <p>Apartment hunters, who this spring seemed caught up in a ''grab it now before it's gone'' panic, no longer have that desperate urge to buy, a desperation that resulted in bidding wars and angry recriminations. Within the last two months, following a rise in interest rates and a plunge in the Nasdaq, bidding wars have declined, apartments have stayed on the market longer before being sold, and hundreds have even been marked down.</p>
        <p>Manhattan real estate prices appear to be finally leveling off.</p>
        <p>''One of the things everyone is beginning to feel is that the market is flat,'' said Deborah B. Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York.</p>
        <p>In another sign of a cooling off, the Real Estate Board measured a 14 percent drop in the number of Manhattan apartments sold for the quarter ended June 30, compared with the same period last year -- ''a significant slowdown,'' Ms. Beck said. At the Corcoran Group, sealed bids, an indicator of unusual levels of competition, were down 33 percent in July compared with July 1999.</p>
        <p>Clearly, the experts say, this is not a case of the seasonal summer blahs.</p>
        <p>The market's softening is most evident with cookie-cutter, ordinary apartments -- notably fixer-uppers -- that had been selling for ''extraordinary prices'' over the last two years, said Pamela Liebman, chief executive at the Corcoran Group.</p>
        <p>Brokers cite myriad examples, including a five-room co-op at 240 East 76th Street reduced in June to $535,000 from $615,000. A one-bedroom at 225 Central Park West near 83rd Street dropped to $305,000 from $335,000 and a studio at 82 Irving Place fell to $175,000 from $190,000. Last Thursday, a two-bedroom at 599 West End Avenue at 89th Street dropped to $349,000 from $369,000.</p>
        <p>Even white-glove Gold Coast prewars may become a harder sell.</p>
        <p>A five-room penthouse at 834 Fifth Avenue, at 64th Street, one of the city's top-tier co-op buildings, went on the market in April priced at $7.9 million. In late June, it was reduced to $6.49 million, and on July 31, the price dropped to $5.8 million.</p>
        <p>''The edge is off the market,'' said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal firm that compiles statistics for Douglas Elliman, the city's biggest brokerage firm. Especially during the last month, Mr. Miller said, ''we're seeing much more modest appreciation, more of a return to normalcy.''</p>
        <p>The experts link the slowdown to the Nasdaq plunge that began on April 14, and to the Federal Reserve's half-point interest rate increase in May, ''the one that really had the impact,'' said Marilyn Harra Kaye, president of Prudential/ MLBKaye Realty. ''Buyers wonder if they'll get a better deal if they wait,'' she said. ''If they buy now, they worry that the higher cost of mortgages will drive prices down and lower their investment.''</p>
        <p>The changing statistics mirror a national trend, but there is nothing to indicate the start of a slump like the one in the late 1980's and early 90's. Real estate experts noted that prices remain high -- the average apartment price for the period April through June was a record $854,704 in Manhattan south of 116th Street on the West Side and south of 96th Street on the East. But that figure represents contracts signed an average of two months before -- in the white-hot months of February, March and April. Based on contracts signed in July, Mr. Miller projected a price rise of only 1 percent, to $864,000. (The average price recorded in 1995 was $414,187.)</p>
        <p>While none of the experts were willing to predict where the Manhattan market would be by the end of the year, no one labeled the cooling temporary. One thing seems certain: One of the biggest sellers' markets in New York history has fractionally tilted more toward the buyer -- and the buyers are noticing.</p>
        <p>For the first time in his two years of looking, Tom Pappas, a Midtown lawyer, has spotted the same properties showing up week after week on his Internet searches. But he is not biting until their prices go down. Then, he vowed, ''I'll be there.''</p>
        <p>Buck Morillas, who sold his house in East Hampton, N.Y., and is prowling for a great $800,000 loft in the Flatiron district, says he thinks he is getting close.</p>
        <p>''Six months ago, the agents were saying, 'This place is going to fly tonight, so you better make an offer,' '' he said. ''Now the agents are whispering, 'This place is very negotiable.' ''</p>
        <p>For their part, brokers insist that no one is grasping at lowball offers, but they concede that now, more sellers are accepting modest reductions off the asking price.</p>
        <p>In interviews, agents said that today's buyers were more cautious and that they spent more time looking, but that many did, in the end, buy -- and at a good price.</p>
        <p>They reject comparisons to the late 1980's, after the October 1987 stock market debacle, when the real estate market dipped -- albeit very slowly -- into the real estate recession of the early 1990's. For one thing, they say, that was the time of a glut of new, sometimes poorly built condominiums; this time, developers built stronger, more lavishly detailed family apartments and lofts, which are still bringing record prices. And those types of luxury apartments, brokers add, are still in short supply.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Ms. Kaye of Prudential/MLBKaye Realty, in a report to be released this week, found 373 price decreases in June (out of 542 changes in price), compared with 189 in February (out of 504 changes), in a market of 15,000 listings, a shift in balance she called significant.</p>
        <p>Brokers explain that many of these price decreases -- especially those in the multimillion-dollar category -- were the result of overpricing. The Fifth Avenue penthouse ''ended up being overpriced,'' said Hall Willkie, head of residential sales at Brown Harris Stevens, the Upper East Side firm with the listing. ''We were testing the market,'' he said. ''We were aggressive, and we had to reduce the price.''</p>
        <p>Part of the problem for brokers is that sellers do not realize that the market is in transition, said Ed Ferris, a broker with William B. May Real Estate. Many sellers expect more money than their neighbors got only a few months ago. But brokers say that kind of escalation is no longer happening.</p>
        <p>''The days when everything was being priced six weeks ahead are over,'' said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate in Manhattan, referring to the strategy of setting a price based on where a property might sell in the future. ''That strategy is not working anymore. The market ain't catching up. Properties priced like that are being reduced.''</p>
        <p>In the report Mr. Miller just finished for Douglas Elliman, he found that properties spent an average of 28 percent more time on the market than they did during the same period a year ago, 118 days versus 92 days.</p>
        <p>These changes reflect a national trend. Fred Flick, the vice president for research at the National Association of Realtors, said the real estate market nationally was down 6 percent in volume; the association estimates that volume will be down 9 percent by the end of the year. And while it still predicts average price increases at 2 percent to 3 percent this year, that is less than last year's 4 percent.</p>
        <p>''We've slowed from a blistering pace to a simmering pace,'' Mr. Flick said.</p>
        <p>The national slowdown was confirmed on Thursday, when the Commerce Department reported that across the country, new-home sales fell 3.7 percent in June to the lowest level in two and a half years. Median prices fell slightly.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, home sales -- both new and existing -- have passed their peak,'' said Lyle Gramley, a consulting economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
        <p>Although the slowdown started hitting the hottest of the country's markets -- cities like San Francisco, Houston and Atlanta -- in late April (the Nasdaq plunge) and in May (the Fed's half-point jump), the market in the Hamptons, out on the sunny, wind-swept tip of Long Island, seemed immune to the trauma.</p>
        <p>But not anymore.</p>
        <p>''Right now there's a certain hesitancy,'' said Frank Newbold, manager of Sotheby International Realty's office in East Hampton. As in Manhattan, the truly premier properties in the Hamptons are still selling close to asking price or above, he said. ''The second-tier properties sit on the shelf a bit,'' he added. Now, there are ''fewer deals, for bigger prices.''</p>
        <p>''Last summer, we were rocking along at full pitch, with no looking back,'' Mr. Newbold said. As recently as the beginning of July, ''it was top down on the convertible and everybody wanted a piece of the rock out here.''</p>
        <p>But now, the urgency is gone. ''Now there's a bit of caution,'' he said, ''like they don't want to be the last fool: the last person to pay the highest price.''</p>
