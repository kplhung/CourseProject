        <p>An off-duty police officer with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was shot in the back last night in Queens near Flushing Meadow Park, the agency said.</p>
        <p>The officer, Julian Hampden, 39, was in serious but stable condition at Elmhurst Hospital Center.</p>
        <p>Officer Hampden, a seven-year veteran stationed at La Guardia Airport, was walking back to his car with a woman on Jewel Avenue near the park around 11 p.m. when he was shot, said Steve Coleman, a Port Authority spokesman. Officer Hampden got in his car, drove off and flagged down a New York City police officer, Mr. Coleman said. The police have no suspects or motive for the shooting, said Detective Edward Reuss, a police spokesman.</p>
