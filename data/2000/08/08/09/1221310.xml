        <p>The Liberty claimed its second straight Eastern Conference title last night with a 57-44 victory over the Cleveland Rockers before 18,663 frenzied fans at Madison Square Garden. But you would not have known it by the atmosphere in the locker room after the game. No music was playing and no one was celebrating; the players quietly patted their teammates' backs for a job well done.</p>
        <p>The Liberty (20-11), which extended a franchise record with its 10th straight victory at Madison Square Garden, will have home-court advantage throughout the Women's National Basketball Association playoffs.</p>
        <p>''No one is really celebrating,'' the Liberty's Sue Wicks said. ''It's not a big deal to anybody. The big deal is that if we get a shot in the playoffs, we have to get through the East. We always had our eyes where we wanted to go in that we wanted to get back to the championship, and unless we do, we'll feel our season isn't complete.''</p>
        <p>Tari Phillips led the Liberty with 14 points and 11 rebounds. Becky Hammon and Crystal Robinson added 11 points apiece. Teresa Weatherspoon contributed 2 points, 7 assists and 6 steals.</p>
        <p>''It was a terrific effort all the way around for everybody,'' Liberty Coach Richie Adubato said. ''Tari Phillips was great. She was brilliant tonight, especially in the second half. I think she had only 2 rebounds in the first half and she wound up with 11.''</p>
        <p>Cleveland's Merlakia Jones led all scorers with 21 points. She also had 6 rebounds.</p>
        <p>The team will face either the Washington Mystics or the Detroit Shock in the two-of-three-game first round. The Liberty will play its first game on the road and the next two at home.</p>
        <p>The Liberty closes its regular season tonight at Detroit.</p>
        <p>Adubato said the Liberty ''played the best first half of basketball,'' it had played all season. While some might argue that his team was helped by Cleveland's 19 turnovers and 17-of-50 shooting from the field (34 percent), there was no denying that the Liberty came to finish a job it failed to do Sunday night against the Miami Sol.</p>
        <p>The Liberty pounced on just about every turnover and missed shot to score. Weatherspoon had three steals and five assists in the first half as the Liberty took a 28-19 lead.</p>
        <p>''At times, I thought we had 10 players out there,'' Adubato said.</p>
        <p>Cleveland (17-14) must have felt the same way.</p>
        <p>With 12 minutes 2 seconds remaining, Rockers forward Mery Andrade scored on a driving layup to pull the Rockers within 4 points, 36-32. After a 20-second timeout, the Liberty outscored Cleveland, 6-0, to take a 42-32 lead. The final basket came on a driving layup by Hammon after a blocked shot by Wicks. Hammon followed with a 20-foot jump shot, her first 3-pointer in nine attempts in the game.</p>
        <p>The closest Cleveland came after that was 53-41 with three minutes remaining. In the final minute, Vickie Johnson, the quiet All-Star forward for the Liberty, dribbled the clock away to a standing ovation from the crowd.</p>
        <p>In defending its conference title, New York defied the odds and oddsmakers who had picked the Liberty to finish no higher than fourth in the conference.</p>
        <p>Any doubt that the new-look Liberty lacked the camaraderie, perimeter shooting and defense that has long been its trademark was put to rest last night.</p>
        <p>The Rockers, who clinched a playoff berth last Thursday with their victory over Utah, will play the Mystics tonight in Washington.</p>
