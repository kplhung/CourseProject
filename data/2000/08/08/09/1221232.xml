        <p>For many years, the ground-level space at 106 West 29th Street was a ramshackle warehouse for hair care products, which seemed appropriate for the neighborhood on the fringes of the garment district.</p>
        <p>But when the space reopened early this year, it was as the headquarters of the Art Directors Club, an 80-year-old trade association for people working in visual communications. The warehouse had been transformed into an exhibition gallery for the advertisements, graphic designs, packaging and new media produced under the supervision of the art directors. The 11,500-square-foot space also includes offices for the club's staff, its board of directors and a lounge for visiting members.</p>

        <p>For many years, the ground-level space at 106 West 29th Street was a ramshackle warehouse for hair care products, which seemed appropriate for the neighborhood on the fringes of the garment district.</p>
        <p>But when the space reopened early this year, it was as the headquarters of the Art Directors Club, an 80-year-old trade association for people working in visual communications. The warehouse had been transformed into an exhibition gallery for the advertisements, graphic designs, packaging and new media produced under the supervision of the art directors. The 11,500-square-foot space also includes offices for the club's staff, its board of directors and a lounge for visiting members.</p>
        <p>Now, officials of the club are trying to link the new location with the nearby flower market and have coined the name ''Floma'' to describe the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>William Oberlander, the club president, acknowledged that some of the older members required some persuading to move from the old location at Park Avenue South and 20th Street to a site some described as ''nonaspirational.'' But like in so many previously industrial areas in Manhattan, the critical shortage of office space elsewhere is persuading upscale tenants to move in.</p>
        <p>According to club officials, once the decision to move to the new location was made last summer, some of the companies employing its members, like interactive media, design firms and advertising agencies, have been relocating nearby.</p>
        <p>Appropriately for an organization devoted to all forms of visual communications, the installation is centered on the 5,000-square-foot gallery and meeting space, which has a 20-foot-high ceiling. The glassed-in front wall extends 70 feet along 29th Street, giving passers-by a look at what is inside.</p>
        <p>The facade is set back from the building line and is not in keeping with the style of the 1920's-vintage building. Peter Guzy of Asfour Guzy Architects says he thinks it may have been altered for a previous tenant, which operated a showroom for mannequins when the garment center was more extensive than it is today.</p>
        <p>To the right of the entrance is a stairway that leads to an open walkway overlooking the gallery and leading to the club's offices on a mezzanine at the rear of the space. The walkway also doubles as a platform when there is a large meeting, as there was in June for the annual awards ceremonies.</p>
        <p>Award winners were summoned to the balcony for the presentation of their trophies. ''It was pretty Mussoliniesque,'' said Mr. Oberlander, who is executive creative director of the Kirschenbaum Bond &amp; Partners advertising agency.</p>
        <p>The main design consideration was to integrate the exhibit gallery with the offices when appropriate, and isolate them when activities in the gallery would interfere with the staff's operations. Sliding glass windows on the mezzanine can shut out the sounds coming from the exhibit floor.</p>
        <p>In addition to exhibits of members' creations, the gallery space is used for lectures, meetings of youth groups and dinners. A wall underneath the balcony separates the galley from a coat closet, bathrooms and a catering kitchen. There is a side entrance, so a caterer can bring in food and drink without crossing the gallery.</p>
        <p>While the space was used as a warehouse, an air-conditioner hung from the ceiling in the center of the room. It was both unsightly and loud, Mr. Guzy said. It has been replaced by two 15-ton coolers that are concealed.</p>
        <p>The chilled air flows from concealed ducts near the top of the room with no duct work crossing the ceiling. Mr. Guzy said that the height of the room made this approach possible because cooled air can be broadcast farther horizontally if it is flowing downward.</p>
        <p>The eastern wall of the gallery measures 20 feet by 70 feet and ''was designed to be grand,'' Mr. Guzy said. It can be used to mount large works of art or as a screen for projectors. The western wall appears to float 12 inches off the ground and has bulbs on the underside to wash it with light.</p>
        <p>Although there is a 12-story office building over most of the space, a setback in the rear allowed installation of skylights over part of the mezzanine and a room off the main gallery. Without the skylights, it would have been difficult to make the spaces attractive for people or for displays of art, Mr. Guzy said.</p>
        <p>Renovation of the space involved building the front staircase and balcony and another, private staircase, plus additions to the mezzanine. The work started last September and had to be completed quickly so that the club could move in starting in December as the lease on its previous location drew to a close.</p>
        <p>''We did not want to go to the expense of storing all our stuff and renting a temporary space,'' said Mr. Oberlander, who noted that the club was a nonprofit institution. The workers, he said, made the deadline. ''Timing was everything,'' he said.</p>
