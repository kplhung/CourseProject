        <p>Residents of this normally safe city were horrified Monday at a shootout in an upscale business district but breathed a sigh of relief today after the police arrested six members of one of Japan's largest organized crime syndicates in the case.</p>
        <p>The incident, which sent shock waves across this relatively crime-free city of eight million people, unfolded at 3:20 p.m. on Monday, when about 15 gangsters wielding knives and swords stormed the office of a right-wing group with ties to the same syndicate in Tokyo's Chiyoda district.</p>
        <p>The police said the gang members, who are affiliated with the Sumiyoshi-kai, one of the three biggest organized crime syndicates in Japan, came to collect on a loan the group owed them. The situation exploded as three members of the right-wing group opened fire on the gangsters, killing Tetsuo Nagashima, 52, and Hideo Takahi, 49, whom police identified as mid-level mob bosses. Five people were wounded.</p>
        <p>Public shootouts are rare in Japan, and the incident was especially troubling because it violated what has long been an unspoken agreement with gang members. The police do not meddle in their affairs as long as the mob operates within set boundaries in its prostitution, gambling, and low-level extortion operations and avoids public violence.</p>
        <p>The shooting also reflected growing turmoil within Japan's mob, or yakuza. The mob has been battered by a weak economy and by a crackdown on some aspects of organized crime by the police and community groups. Rival factions, often from the same clan, are increasingly fighting for control of shrinking criminal enterprises.</p>
        <p>''This type of Godfather violence is not supposed to happen in Japan,'' said a senior police official. ''Yes, we have organized gangs in Japan, but like everything else in our society there are set rules and parameters to keep the wa, or harmony.''</p>
        <p>With the recession depressing revenues from the gangs' legitimate businesses like construction, they have become more dependent on their illegal activities, like traffic in  drugs and guns.</p>
        <p>Of the five people injured in the shootout, four were from the crime gang and one was from the right-wing group Sofusha, or Blue Wind Group, which the police said has 30 members and was established in 1983 by former members of gangs related to the same Sumiyoshi-kai syndicate.</p>
        <p>The police said that the rightist group had a business arrangement, including cooperation on loan collection, with the other gangsters but that relations between the two groups soured over how to divide profits.</p>
        <p>Sofusha is well known in Tokyo for its right-wing political activities, especially its loud-speaker truck that has traversed city streets demanding the return of four Russian-held islands off the northern island of Hokkaido. In recent months, the group had fallen on hard financial times and indicated it would disband, the police said.</p>
        <p>The right-wing group's office is located along Shinjuku-dori Avenue near the Hanzomon district, where the Imperial Place and a residential complex for lawmakers are situated.</p>
        <p>Tomonori Ikeda, 30, a clerk who works in an adjacent building, told the Japan Times newspaper that after the shooting he saw a man covered with blood running and using a cellular phone. ''I can't believe a shooting happened here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While the level of violent crime in Japan remains very low in comparison with those in the United States and most other countries, many Japanese have become alarmed at a recent increase in crimes, especially by young people. Still, the streets of Tokyo and other Japanese cities are relatively safe to walk at any hour.</p>
        <p>In March, authorities expressed concern over a series of firebombing attacks against telephone dating clubs -- places where men come to arrange for sexual encounters with prostitutes. The police said the bombings were the result of increasing competition between rival gangs related to Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's largest crime syndicate.</p>
