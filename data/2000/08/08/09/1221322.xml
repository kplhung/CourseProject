        <p>A report in the Compressed Data column of Business Day on July 24 about an announcement by the technology entrepreneur James H. Clark that he had bought a million shares of Microsoft stock referred imprecisely to a comment made about him later, at the same industry conference, by the venture capitalist John Doerr. Mr. Doerr's speech described two categories of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs -- missionaries and mercenaries. It was in response to a question from the moderator that Mr. Doerr said Mr. Clark would probably consider himself a mercenary; Mr. Doerr did not characterize Mr. Clark that way unprompted.</p>
