        <p>EVERY few years, I like to come here to the Willamette Valley to check up on the Oregon wine business.</p>
        <p>I could do it in New York, I guess, tasting a lot of wines and talking to the winemakers by phone. But it's not the same as being here, and to be honest, it's certainly not as much fun.

        <p>EVERY few years, I like to come here to the Willamette Valley to check up on the Oregon wine business.</p>
        <p>I could do it in New York, I guess, tasting a lot of wines and talking to the winemakers by phone. But it's not the same as being here, and to be honest, it's certainly not as much fun. By staying home, I would miss the International Pinot Noir Celebration, a free-spirited yearly gathering in this town in the heart of the Oregon wine country.</p>
        <p>This year, the owners and winemakers of 34 Oregon wineries turned up at the end of July for the three-day gathering on the campus of Linfield College. Joining them were winemakers from California, Burgundy, Alsace, Australia, New Zealand and British Columbia.</p>
        <p>Pinot noir, which is the red wine grape of Burgundy, is slowly taking an honored place in the rest of the world. Over the last three decades, it has become the principal red wine grape in Oregon, too.</p>
        <p>When I first visited the Willamette Valley in the 1970's, there was little more than a handful of wineries, most of them underfinanced and overshadowed by their already glamorous California competitors. There were a few hundred acres of pinot noir grapes. It is a frustratingly difficult grape to grow, and there were plenty of experts around ready to write off the grape, and by inference the Oregon wine industry as well.</p>
        <p>Today in Oregon, there are 150 wineries, ranging from modest, artisanal producers Like Eyrie Vineyards, where it all started, to big California-style wineries, like King Estate in Eugene, rivaling in size and production almost anything in the Napa Valley. What's more, business is thriving. For every new winery under construction, dozens of investors are putting money into new vineyards. There are 10,000 acres of wine grapes in the state, with thousands more scheduled for planting, growers here say.</p>
        <p>Land prices have shot up, from around $4,000 an acre 10 years ago to at least $20,000 an acre now. But that's still less than half of what land would cost in the prime grape-growing areas of California.</p>
        <p>What makes success particularly sweet for the Oregonians is the fact that, rather quietly, the Californians are coming up to join them. Recent arrivals include the dynamic Benziger family, which has 60 acres of Oregon land in pinot noir and expects to release its first Oregon wines in a year or two. Tony Soter, one of the Napa Valley's legendary winemakers at Spotteswood and more recently at Etude, also has a vineyard here, producing 9,000 cases of Oregon pinot noir a year. Benton Lane, founded by the veteran Napa Valley winemaker Carl Doumani, is another acclaimed Oregon winery with a California antecedent.</p>
        <p>Oregon winemakers -- the pioneers, anyway -- never let anyone forget that when the famous Burgundy producer Joseph Drouhin decided to invest in America, it was the red hills of Oregon rather than the valleys of California that became home for Domaine Drouhin Oregon, operated by Veronique Drouhin, daughter of Robert Drouhin, the head of the French company. Many local winemakers believe it was the arrival of Drouhin in 1988 that gave the budding Oregon industry the self-assurance and the credibility it needed.</p>
        <p>The French winemaker is such a fixture in the region that it is known familiarly as the D.D.O., much as the famed Domaine de la Romanee-Conti in Burgundy is called the D.R.C.</p>
        <p>Like the region itself, the Oregon celebration is militantly informal. Notebooks, furrowed brows and studious expressions are discouraged.  Which does not preclude the overall impression that Oregon pinot noirs have come of age. Caught in such a profusion of delicious wines, it would have been sheer recklessness to announce that this one was obviously from Oregon, that one from the Cote de Beaune, that one from Carneros or the Anderson Valley.</p>
        <p>Is there an Oregon style? Yes, Oregon pinots are leaner and less full-bodied than the California versions. And perhaps less delicate, less velvety than many Burgundies. But no sooner does one deliver that sort of pronouncement here than someone appears with a bottle saying ''Try this,'' and another hypothesis bites the dust.</p>
        <p>If any trait has developed over the years I've been coming here, it is consistency. It appeared in the vertical tastings of Ponzi Vineyards and Domaine Drouhin going back to 1980 in the case of Ponzi and 1988 with Drouhin. I remember it, too, from a vertical tasting of David Lett's Eyrie Vineyards several years ago that went back even further. His first wines were made in the late 1960's.</p>
        <p>While Oregon is known particularly for its pinot noirs, the state's winegrowers are also constantly experimenting with other varieties. There is quite a bit of chardonnay around, but Oregon pinot gris is a wine to single out. It has the weight of chardonnay but (usually) without the oak and cloying sweetness. Some boosters say it was invented to go with another local commodity: salmon.</p>
        <p>It's worth noting that not only the Oregonians are making fine pinot noir these days. Thanks to the gathering here, I discovered a remarkable New Zealand pinot, a 1999 from the Felton Road winery in Central Otago. Another came from, of all places, the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia. It was a 1997 from Blue Mountain Vineyard and Cellars. Then, too, there was the 1998 Nuits-St.-Georges Premier Cru, Clos des Forets-St.-Georges, from the Domaine de l'Arlot, but that's another column.</p>
