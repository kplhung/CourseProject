        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton moved yesterday  to turn Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's presence on the national ticket to her political advantage, saying she wanted him to campaign by her side this fall. She predicted that Mr. Lieberman's presence on the New York ballot would increase turnout among Jewish voters and lift her own Senate candidacy, an assertion that was immediately disputed by Representative Rick A. Lazio, her Republican opponent.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton discussed having Mr. Lieberman come to New York during a congratulatory conversation with the Connecticut senator on the day that Vice President Al Gore formally announced that he had chosen Mr. Lieberman to be the first Jew to run on a major-party ticket for national office.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, whose aides have been worried about her relative lack of support among Jewish voters in New York, described Mr. Gore's decision as a welcome development for Mrs. Clinton's candidacy, in terms of increasing her support among Democrats in general and Jewish voters in particular.</p>
        <p>''As people get to meet him, they're going to come away just impressed and really energized by this choice,'' the first lady said in an interview on WROW-AM radio in Albany. ''And I think here in New York, it's going to drive up the vice president's numbers, which will be great for the ticket and for, you know, the popular vote. I think it's going to be really a good decision across the board. So I expect it will help in New York, but I suspect it's going to help around the country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, disputed Mrs. Clinton's analysis, asserting that developments in the presidential race would have no bearing on the high-profile contest between Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton. Nonetheless, in a suggestion of some concern in Mr. Lazio's camp, the candidate took a break from a closed fund-raising tour in California to chastise Mrs. Clinton for her remarks and note several  issues on which Mrs. Clinton disagreed with Mr. Lieberman, including his support for school vouchers.</p>
        <p>''Hillary Clinton is many things, but she's no Joe Lieberman,'' Mr. Lazio said in Thousand Oaks, Calif., according to a transcript of his remarks provided by his press office. ''If Mrs. Clinton thinks Senator Lieberman can drag her across the finish line in New York, she's sorely mistaken. She's desperate to make this race about anything other than our records.''</p>
        <p>The cross-country exchange yesterday suggested the extent to which a decision made by Mr. Gore to help his own campaign had captured the attention of both candidates in the race for Senate in New York.</p>
        <p>Republicans and Democrats said yesterday that Mr. Gore's decision would have some effect on the New York race, though there was some debate about how much it had shifted the landscape.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has had difficulty winning the level of support among Jewish voters that Democratic candidates typically draw in New York, so the Lieberman selection could prove fruitful for her.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Senator Charles E. Schumer, running against Alfonse M. D'Amato, drew 75 percent of the Jewish vote, according to a survey of voters leaving by the polls. Jewish voters made up 12 percent of the electorate that year.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mrs. Clinton appears be drawing closer to 60 percent, according to Democrat and Republican  analysts who have reviewed public and private polls. They say that she probably needs 65 percent to win the election.</p>
        <p>A campaign aide to Mrs. Clinton predicted that the Lieberman development could add two full percentage points to her showing on Election Day, a margin that could make the difference in what most polls show as an extremely close race.</p>
        <p>Mayor Edward I. Koch, the former mayor and one of her most important Jewish supporters, said Jewish support was now ''going to pour out here in the city and across the state.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Schumer said in an interview that Mrs. Clinton would benefit both because of the increased turnout and because the selection of an Orthodox Jew who is relatively moderate would reassure Orthodox Jews worried that the party was drifting from their concerns.</p>
        <p>''It excites people about the ticket, both Jewish and non-Jewish,'' he said. ''And that is good for Hillary Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's selection almost certainly erases any chance that George W. Bush will invest much time or money in New York.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans said that was a cause for concern for Mr. Lazio, whose aides have already been worried that they would be unable to swim against the tide of a large victory by Mr. Gore in New York.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, from the beginning, this has been anything but a typical race, and several factors suggest that Mr. Lieberman's selection may not provide as much help to Mrs. Clinton as she would like.</p>
        <p>For one thing, Jews already vote in large numbers, particularly in a presidential race, so the actual increase in turnout may not be as large as her supporters suggested.</p>
        <p>And even Mrs. Clinton's associates acknowledged that animosity toward the first lady means that Jewish voters who turn out for Mr. Gore could leave the voting booth without casting a vote for Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Bruce J. Teitelbaum, who has extensive ties to the Orthodox Jewish community and served as Mr. Giuliani's campaign manager in the Senate race, said the Lieberman selection posed at best an opportunity for Mrs. Clinton. ''Lieberman's presence will attract more Jews to the polls in November, but she needs to seize the opportunity to get Jews to vote for her, and I don't think she will,'' Mr. Teitelbaum said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton quickly moved to demonstrate how she intended to use Mr. Lieberman to her advantage, campaigning in Orthodox communities in Rockland County yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>She told an audience of schoolgirls in New Square that Mr. Lieberman ''has been my friend for 30 years,'' and said his selection showed how committed Mr. Gore and the Democratic Party were to Jewish voters.</p>
        <p>''I, as an American, and you as Jewish-Americans would take pleasure in his nomination,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides sought to undercut Mrs. Clinton yesterday by noting areas in which the two Democrats disagreed, and added that Mr. Lieberman had taken the floor of the Senate to denounce President Clinton for his involvement with Monica S. Lewinsky. Mrs. Clinton evinced no concern about either issue.</p>
        <p>''I consider both of us to be sort of mainstream centrist New Democrats,'' she said in her Albany radio interview. ''We don't agree 100 percent on all the issues.''</p>
        <p>As to what Mr. Lieberman said about her husband, she said: ''You know, the president said he agreed with him. And I think people are going to find a lot to like about Joe Lieberman.''</p>
