        <p>As much of the nation gets its first glimpse of Joseph I. Lieberman, back in Connecticut, friends and family members have spent the last 48 hours recalling a different sort of Joe: The talentless Little League outfielder, the magnetic high school prom king, the shrewd college newspaper editor and the ambitious young campaigner.</p>
        <p>In an age when politicians traverse time zones like astronauts and speak in made-for-television sound bites, Mr. Lieberman remains a firmly rooted, frequently long-winded exception to the rule. For all of his 58 years, he has made his home in only two Connecticut cities, New Haven and Stamford -- but for his Georgetown pied-a-terre -- while spending the last three decades playing an increasingly prominent role in this state's political history.</p>
        <p>Growing up in a working-class section of Stamford, in the 1950's and 1960's, Mr. Lieberman was smart but unassuming, quiet but confident, friends said. And he was a natural charmer, a future high school Mr. Personality.</p>
        <p>''He always appeared to be older than the rest of us,'' said Jack Romanos, the president of Simon &amp; Schuster in New York City, a classmate of  Mr. Lieberman's at Burdick Junior High School and later at Stamford High. ''More mature, much more serious. It was pretty clear early on that politics was just burning inside him.''</p>
        <p>Nearly everyone interviewed -- and certainly all the Democrats -- spoke admiringly of Mr. Lieberman,  mentioning his ability to connect with people across racial, religious or class lines. Only Lieberman family relatives, in fact, described him today as an unexceptional student, a regular kid from the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''He could talk to those at the top of the class and those that weren't really at the top,'' said Herman Alswanger, a counselor at Camp J.C., a summer program at the Jewish Center in Stamford, which Mr. Lieberman attended when he was 8 or 9 years old. A consensus builder even then, Mr. Lieberman took the reins during one of the center's arts and crafts periods to propose building a miniature golf course, Mr. Alswanger recalled. ''He got all the kids to work together to build this course.''</p>
        <p>Those political skills would serve Mr. Lieberman throughout his life, at Yale University, at Yale Law School, as a private lawyer and state senator and, most recently, as Connecticut's junior senator from New Haven.</p>
        <p>As a young boy, he lived in a house next to a junkyard, on Hawthorne Street in Stamford, with his grandmother Minnie, his parents, Henry and Marcia Lieberman, and his two sisters, Rietta and Ellen. Stamford remains his mother's home.</p>
        <p>Playing for the Stamford Fire Department's Little League team, hapless Joe was relegated to deep right field, ''where he wouldn't ever get hurt,'' Mr. Romanos recalled. During important games, he was rarely allowed to play. ''I joke with Joe that he learned pretty quickly that athletics were not going to be his way to fame and fortune,'' Mr. Romanos  said. ''He was awful.''</p>
        <p>A turning point came in 1956, when Mr. Lieberman ran for president of his ninth-grade class. In a campaign speech to his classmates, he craftily mixed in references to some of the top rock 'n' roll hits of the day, like ''Earth Angel'' and ''Rock Around the Clock,'' according to his memoir, ''In Praise of Public Life,'' which Simon &amp; Schuster published earlier this year.</p>
        <p>He won that first campaign, but it failed to impress him. ''I wasn't dreaming of the U.S. Senate,'' Mr. Lieberman wrote. ''I still imagined myself playing center field in the major leagues.''</p>
        <p>Soon, however, he realized that baseball was better left to the Yankees, his favorite team, and he focused more intently on his people skills.</p>
        <p>''He moved from baseball to politics, from age 12 to 13, and never looked back,'' Mr. Romanos said.</p>
        <p>In high school, Mr. Lieberman found his rhythm, winning the class presidency in his sophomore and senior years, participating in the a cappella choir, the synagogue's youth group and the debating club, all while securely entrenched on the honor roll each semester.</p>
        <p>In history class, Abe Hecht, Mr. Lieberman's teacher and a family cousin, took to calling him ''senator,'' said Sam Bernstein, a Stamford lawyer who is related to Mr. Lieberman. Above his senior-class photo, the school's 1960 yearbook describes young Joseph Lieberman as Mr. Personality, with ''always a kind word for everyone'' and ''a successful future assured.''</p>
        <p>Such references were only an extension of the image Mr. Lieberman had begun developing, by all accounts without calculation, on Stamford's Hamilton Avenue, where his father's liquor store, an Italian barber shop and an Irish bar stood one beside the other, a silent testimony to the American dream.</p>
        <p>''Here you had Joe's dad, being Jewish, and my dad, the Italian barber, and right next door was Burns Tavern,'' said Joe Richichi, another Stamford lawyer who grew up in the same neighborhood. ''Joe saw no color. Joe saw no differences in religion.''</p>
        <p>Voted king of his senior prom, Mr. Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, stayed home to observe the Sabbath, Mr. Richichi said. ''There was an empty chair next to the queen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At Yale, Mr. Lieberman became an official Democrat and joined the university's N.A.A.C.P. chapter. He rose through the ranks at The Yale Daily News to become, in 1962, its chairman and chief editorial writer, a lofty post held previously by William F. Buckley and other prominent writers and journalists. As civil rights became a national obsession, Mr. Lieberman wrote wrote opinion pieces supporting blacks in the South.</p>
        <p>While still a student at Yale's law school, Mr. Lieberman wanted to run for alderman in New Haven but realized he had not lived in the city long enough to qualify, said Thayer Baldwin, the city's current corporation counsel, who has known Mr. Lieberman since 1967. After graduating, Mr. Lieberman joined Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign as the state chairman for Citizens for Kennedy, a statewide group.</p>
        <p>In 1970, Mr. Lieberman, a young lawyer working in New Haven, ran an improbable campaign to unseat a powerful incumbent, Ed Marcus, the State Senate's Democratic majority leader. He won the all-important party primary, thanks partly to a young Yale Law School student named Bill Clinton who worked on his staff.</p>
        <p>A decade later, Mr. Lieberman lost  a bid for the House of Representatives, but in 1982 he successfully ran for Connecticut's attorney general. In 1988, Mr. Lieberman pulled off the upset of his career, defeating United States Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in a race spent bellowing to crowds from the back of large campaign truck.</p>
        <p>That victory surprised even Lieberman loyalists. ''He seemed so vulnerable,'' said Richard Blumenthal, the current attorney general and an old friend. ''Everyone thought he was going to lose.''</p>
        <p>Since then, Mr. Lieberman has forged a reputation as the moral conscience of his party, a role he will be asked to play beside Mr. Gore in coming months.</p>
        <p>''You'll never find anything negative about Joe Lieberman,'' said Mr. Richichi, Mr. Lieberman's boyhood friend. ''He's as honest and straight as the day is long. But he wasn't a nerd. Joe was a regular guy.''</p>
        <p>Asked how his family felt about Mr. Lieberman's rise to national party candidate, Mr. Bernstein said: ''They just can't believe it. Being attorney general and senator was nice. But vice president of the United States, that's really something.''</p>
