        <p>A dispute between a friary and the federal government over an 18-acre parcel of forest in Garrison, N.Y., is  on its way to resolution after the parties were brought together to discuss their differences on a hike.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department has agreed not to take legal action forcing the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement to sell the rights to 18 acres next to its Graymoor Spiritual Life Center, established in 1898.</p>
        <p>In 1984, the National Park Service bought an easement on 58 acres of the 400-acre Graymoor property for a stretch of the Appalachian Trail.  The trail runs through the property, which is home to 45 friars, 86 nuns and various ministries, including a homeless shelter.</p>
        <p>Since 1985, the Park Service, which oversees the 2,144-mile trail, has been trying to buy another easement, on 18 acres adjacent to the trail, for ''buffer land.'' But the friars have refused to sell, maintaining that giving up rights to the land would endanger the future of their ministry. In June, the Park Service asked the Justice Department to order the friars to sell the 18 acres by eminent domain, a legal procedure that allows governments to take land for the public good at its market value.</p>
        <p>But on Monday, Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representative Sue W. Kelly brought both sides together to discuss the issue over a hike on the wooded trail at Graymoor.</p>
        <p>Both sides agreed to meet on Aug. 23 to draw up a legal arrangement, which would protect the land against development and make it accessible to the friars and the government.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Arthur M. Johnson, minister general of Graymoor, said the friars and the Park Service would meet ''with no attorneys present.'' He said he looked forward to working out a solution without the fear of eminent domain proceedings.</p>
