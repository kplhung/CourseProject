        <p>President Chandrika Kumaratunga's long-awaited peace plan for this war-torn nation -- embodied in a new constitution that would have given greater automomy to the Hindu Tamil minority in this majority Buddhist Sinhalese nation -- seemed to have foundered Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kumaratunga had planned to push the proposed constitution through Parliament after only three days of debate, with a final vote today. But on Tuesday her government postponed voting indefinitely, apparently bowing to the reality that it lacked the necessary two-thirds majority.</p>
        <p>The state-run newspaper quoted a government minister today as saying that the government planned to resume the debate on the bill with the hope of finishing it before this Parliament ends in a little more than two weeks.</p>
        <p>National elections must be held by early November.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kumaratunga, the Sinhalese leader who more than any other has reached out to the Tamils, told Parliament last week that her proposal would help end a civil war that has cost more than 60,000 lives.</p>
        <p>It would convince the Tamils, she said, that the Sinhalese were sincere about sharing power with them and that the Tamil people no longer need support the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a group of separatist rebels who have been fighting for a Tamil homeland in the country's north and east for 17 years.</p>
        <p>But her proposal -- written and rewritten during the past six years -- is a compromise that has failed to satisfy some moderate Tamil politicians or to mollify the Sinhalese right wing and the influential Buddhist clergy who feared it was a threat to the majority population.</p>
        <p>Nor, despite months of negotiations with the opposition United National Party -- the country's other major Sinhalese-dominated party -- was Mrs. Kumaratunga's Sri Lanka Freedom Party able to achieve a bipartisan consensus for the constitution.</p>
