        <p>GOLDBERG-Dave. Died August 6 at his home in Tamarac, FL. He was 87 years old. He was a pioneer in the swimwear industry in the 1950s, and the company bearing his name is still one of the leading swimwear firms in the country. The many licenses the company had over the years included Coca Cola Girls, Gottex Girls, Sasson, and currently Monte Carlo Beach Club, Beach Scene and Bay 1. He was a past president of the Industrial Association of Juvenile Apparel Manufacturers and, in addition to the many charitable organizations he supported, several years ago he was honored by UJA as the swimwear industry's ''Man of the Year''. He had an indomitable spirit and inspiring vision, and he had the respect of all who knew him. He will be sorely missed and will live on in the hearts of all whose lives he touched. He is survived by his wife, Rose, his brother Irving, his daughter Marilyn and her husband Richard, his son Allen and his wife Patty, and by his four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. A graveside ceremony will be held at Cedar Park-Bethel Cemetery in Paramus, New Jersey, 201261-7878, at 11:00 AM on Tuesday, August 8. The family will sit at the home of Marilyn and Richard Dickstein, Muttontown, NY on Tuesday and Wednesday, August 8 and 9. Contributions may be made to the Lymphoma Research Foundation of America, 8800 Venice Blvd, Los Angeles, CA. 90034.</p>
