        <p>THE challenge for Su-Mei Yu, a Chinese woman who was born in Thailand and grew up there, was to explain Thai cooking and to try to simplify it for the American home cook without compromising its authenticity. In her book, ''Cracking the Coconut: Classic Thai Home Cooking'' (William Morrow, $30), she does a first-rate job of getting to the heart of this complex and compelling cuisine, for which there are so few good cookbooks, and making it understandable. But simplify it? That's another matter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Yu, who has lived in the United States since she was 15 and now owns a restaurant, Saffron, in San Diego, provides a collection of vibrant recipes, which, if followed in traditional Thai fashion, become a fascinating weekend's adventure. The first time I opened this book I embarked on a far-flung shopping expedition for fermented shrimp paste and various fresh and dried chilies and herbs before settling in for an afternoon's and evening's workout. I finally put an excellent moderately spicy chicken stew with jasmine rice and a refreshingly tangy green papaya salad on the table at 9 p.m.</p>

        <p>THE challenge for Su-Mei Yu, a Chinese woman who was born in Thailand and grew up there, was to explain Thai cooking and to try to simplify it for the American home cook without compromising its authenticity. In her book, ''Cracking the Coconut: Classic Thai Home Cooking'' (William Morrow, $30), she does a first-rate job of getting to the heart of this complex and compelling cuisine, for which there are so few good cookbooks, and making it understandable. But simplify it? That's another matter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Yu, who has lived in the United States since she was 15 and now owns a restaurant, Saffron, in San Diego, provides a collection of vibrant recipes, which, if followed in traditional Thai fashion, become a fascinating weekend's adventure. The first time I opened this book I embarked on a far-flung shopping expedition for fermented shrimp paste and various fresh and dried chilies and herbs before settling in for an afternoon's and evening's workout. I finally put an excellent moderately spicy chicken stew with jasmine rice and a refreshingly tangy green papaya salad on the table at 9 p.m.</p>
        <p>In other words, this is not a book for cooks primarily looking for a quick and easy menu for dinner.</p>
        <p>Preparation of the basic seasoning pastes, for example, cannot be hurried. They are best made in a good-size stone mortar, with each of the 10 or 12 ingredients, some of which are toasted first, added in succession while you pound away. You think the mixture will never come around, but then, after a good 30 minutes, you have the paste you need. (Occasionally a food processor is suggested instead of the stone mortar for making short work of a bunch of ingredients, but Ms. Yu warns that the result will not have perfect complexity, subtlety and texture.)</p>
        <p>In preparing fresh coconut milk, one step requires squeezing ground coconut through a cloth 89 times, a Thai tradition. Why not 90 times, or 40? For a task that only the most determined cooks are likely to tackle anyway, the author does not offer an explanation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Yu, fussy about her ingredients, grudgingly accepts lime zest as a substitute for shredded kaffir lime leaves, and ginger in place of fresh galangal, a similar rhizome. She doesn't even suggest the coconut oil that is so common in Thai cooking (some recipes call for olive oil), and she allows tinned coconut milk as a substitute for fresh.</p>
        <p>Most of her recipes require an immensely detailed shopping list, with some ingredients, like lemon grass and jasmine rice, often sold in supermarkets, and others, like nam pla sauce and green papayas, available only in Asian markets or by mail.</p>
        <p>The author tries to reassure the cook that all this shopping and preparation is easy and simple. But no cookbook can be called simple if it recommends 30 minutes of pounding in a mortar or washing and trimming the tiny roots from a bunch of cilantro and then mincing them.</p>
        <p>Ms. Yu's contribution has been to make Thai cooking interesting and thoroughly satisfying. In that vein, she explains how Thai cuisine has evolved over hundreds of years, absorbing influences from other Asian kitchens, the Arab world and the West. She devotes chapters to the cuisine's essential components like coconut, rice, seasoning blends, curries and salads.</p>
        <p>The cooking techniques in this book are not difficult, just time-consuming, and the recipes are not as complicated as assembling a galantine or making a gateau St.-Honore. It certainly helps to have some of the proper equipment, like a roomy mortar, a spice mill and a Chinese cleaver. I happen to own an authentic wooden Thai coconut grater in the shape of a rabbit (the business end is its nasty iron tongue), which I took from its spot on a display shelf for the first time.</p>
        <p>A handful of recipes are relatively quick to prepare, among them grilled lobster salad, shrimp with bamboo shoots and grilled tuna with green mango. I even dared omit some of the garnishes, like green beans in the spicy green papaya salad, and never missed them.</p>
        <p>But for the most part, you have to be ready for a serious kitchen session to produce dishes that you are unlikely to find in a Thai restaurant, like the rich green curry and coconut soup with corn-studded meatballs, or the fiery keang chu-chi shrimp.</p>
        <p>For the beef and green papaya stew, Ms. Yu even says that ''the secret is patience.'' That about sums up the book, but the effort is not wasted.</p>
        <p>GRILLED LOBSTER SALAD  Adapted from ''Cracking the Coconut: Classic Thai Home Cooking''  Time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>Sea salt</p>
        <p>1/4 cup fish sauce (nam pla, sold in Asian markets)  5 tablespoons sugar</p>
        <p>1/2 cup fresh lime juice  2 cloves garlic, minced  12 fresh bird chilies or 8 serrano chilies, half seeded, half not, all minced  1 cup white wine  1  1/2-inch piece ginger, sliced thin  3 scallions  3 sprigs cilantro  1 teaspoon white peppercorns, preferably Thai  3 1 1/2-pound lobsters  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  3 shallots, sliced thin  3 stalks lemon grass, trimmed down to core, core minced  5 kaffir lime leaves, slivered, or julienne strips of zest of 1 lime  10 sprigs fresh mint  6 to 7 Napa cabbage leaves, finely shredded.</p>
        <p>1. Mix  1/2 teaspoon sea salt with fish sauce and sugar in small saucepan. Heat until sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Transfer to mixing bowl, and cool. Stir in lime juice, garlic and three-fourths of the chilies. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Fill stockpot three-fourths full with water, and bring to a boil. Add wine, ginger, scallions, cilantro and peppercorns. Boil 5 minutes. Add lobsters, cover and boil 10 minutes, until lobsters are red. Drain lobsters and let cool.</p>
        <p>3. Preheat broiler or grill. Split lobsters in shells. Discard tomalley and coral. Sprinkle cut sides with salt, and brush with oil. Broil, cut side up, or grill, cut side down, about 7 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove lobster meat from tail shells and claws, and cut in bite-size pieces. Place in large mixing bowl. Add shallots, lemon grass and lime leaves or zest, and toss gently.</p>
        <p>4. Taste reserved dressing. Add some or all remaining chilies, to taste. Pour dressing over lobster salad. Sliver leaves from 4 sprigs of mint, and fold in. Line platter with shredded cabbage, top with lobster salad and garnish with remaining mint sprigs.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 appetizer servings.</p>
