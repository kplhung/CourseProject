        <p>The widely expected sodomy conviction of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim,  which was announced early today, could snuff out the career of a charismatic leader who was seen as one of the rising stars in Asian politics.</p>
        <p>The terse ruling, which came on top of a previous conviction for corruption, capped a long, corrosive legal battle.</p>
        <p>Judge Ariffin Jaka found Mr. Anwar guilty of sodomy and sentenced him to nine years in prison. He declared that Mr. Anwar had committed ''despicable acts in our society,'' and deserved the ''utmost condemnation.''</p>
        <p>The latest verdict marked the end of a two-year drama that had riveted this nation of 22 million, and had repercussions beyond it. Mr. Anwar's trial called into question the motives of Malaysia's leaders and credibility of its courts. It also exposed a deeply traditional country to a relentlessly sordid spectacle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anwar, 52, reacted to the sentence with a mix of coolness and anger. He smiled and hugged members of his family who had gathered in the courtroom, but later exploded in frustration, saying: ''Bloody, rotten judiciary!''</p>
        <p>Before the sentence was read, Mr. Anwar delivered a withering denunciation of his former boss, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. He accused Dr. Mahathir of orchestrating a conspiracy to destroy him, and said Malaysia's judiciary had demeaned itself by doing his bidding.</p>
        <p>''Dr. Mahathir's lust for power is insatiable,'' said Mr. Anwar, brushing aside angry protests from the judge. ''He will lie and force others to lie.''</p>
        <p>The judge found Mr. Anwar's brother, Sukma Darmawan, 39, guilty of sodomy as well, sentencing him to six years and four strokes with a rattan cane. Mr. Anwar escaped the caning because that penalty is not given to people older than 49. Both men were convicted of engaging in homosexual relations with Azizan Abu Bakar, a former driver for the family.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anwar's lawyers said they would appeal the sentence, which one described as ''mind-boggling.'' Although the judge could have imposed a 20-year term, Mr. Anwar said he was expecting six years.</p>
        <p>Supporters of Mr. Anwar predicted the harsh sentence would unleash a new wave of political unrest here.</p>
        <p>''This is going to sustain the opposition movement to Dr. Mahathir,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, the deputy president of the National Justice Party, which was formed last year after Mr. Anwar's first conviction. ''People are going to see it as another example of Mahathir's cruelty.''</p>
        <p>But outside the courthouse, there was little evidence of the outrage that drew thousands into the streets after the first verdict. This morning, several hundred supporters of Mr. Anwar gathered at a mosque behind the courthouse. A few carried a banner that said, ''Free Anwar.''</p>
        <p>The government had threatened to crack down on any pro-Anwar demonstrations. That warning, combined with a formidable array of riot police officers and water-cannon trucks, seemed to work. The police quickly dispersed the protesters, arresting at least 12 people.</p>
        <p>The verdict will do little for Malaysia's tarnished reputation overseas. Amnesty International and other human rights groups condemned the decision, as did the New Zealand government. Human Rights Watch, based in New York, said, ''The verdicts are another blow to justice in Malaysia.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Anwar's case has always been about more than his sexual practices. From the day he was dismissed by Dr. Mahathir in September 1998, Mr. Anwar has been waging a war against his former mentor for the soul of this country.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Mahathir, 74, a onetime country doctor, presided over a great Asian success story -- transforming a fractured, ethnically polyglot former British colony into a well-oiled economy. He had carefully groomed Mr. Anwar, a Muslim youth leader with Western sophistication, to be his successor.</p>
        <p>But when the regional economic crisis tore through Malaysia's palm plantations and semiconductor factories, the two men began to clash over policy. Mr. Anwar favored the remedies of the International Monetary Fund, while Dr. Mahathir inveighed against foreign currency traders.</p>
        <p>Some economists argue that the differences between the two men were overblown. But there is no question that Dr. Mahathir felt threatened. Rather than fading away -- or being toppled like his Indonesian counterpart, Suharto -- the prime minister made a pre-emptive strike.</p>
        <p>The nature of the charges against Mr. Anwar guaranteed that his trial would be a lurid affair. Homosexuality is taboo in this Muslim country, and Malaysians were alternately enthralled and repelled by the talk of furtive encounters and soiled mattresses. But as the trial dragged on, public interest flagged.</p>
        <p>Supporters of Mr. Anwar said the sexual misconduct case was hopelessly flimsy. The government prosecutors switched the dates of the supposed offense three times. Mr. Azizan, the former driver, said he had been asked by the police to testify to a new date.</p>
        <p>But Judge Ariffin said, ''I'm satisfied the prosecution has proven its case against both accused beyond reasonable doubt.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Anwar must serve the nine-year sentence after his six years for corruption. Even if both terms are reduced by one-third for good behavior, Mr. Anwar faces a decade behind bars. Under Malaysian law, he is forbidden to run for office for five years after his release.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mahathir, by contrast, was re-elected handily last November. His coalition amassed a huge majority in Parliament. The prime minister, who has been in power 19 years and is Asia's longest-ruling leader, said this would be his last term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anwar's allies noted Dr. Mahathir had paid a price for his attacks -- losing many of the Malay voters who were the bedrock of his party, the United Malays National Organization. Disgusted by the trial, these voters switched their allegiance to Malaysia's Islamic party in the elections.</p>
        <p>Still, even Mr. Anwar's most fervent supporters acknowledge their jailed hero can no longer be the driving force of the anti-Mahathir movement. ''He was very important to the reformasi movement,'' said Mr. Chandra of the Justice Party. ''But the struggle for change needs to go beyond Anwar.''</p>
        <p>For her part, Mr. Anwar's wife is confronting the prospect of life without her husband. Sitting in the sun-drenched living room of her home here last week, Wan Azizah said she wanted her children to recover a sense of normalcy after the turmoil of the past two years. She has urged her eldest daughter to stay out of politics to concentrate on her college studies.</p>
        <p>''I wish in my heart that Anwar won't spend years and years in jail,'' Dr. Wan Azizah said wistfully. ''But I feel this doom looming over me.''</p>
