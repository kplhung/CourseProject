        <p>Editorial on need to bolster efforts to contain fires burning in 11 Western states; lauds Pres Clinton's plan to release $150 million in emergency funds</p>

        <p>The American West is a checkerboard of fires this summer, with some 66 large wildland fires currently burning in 11 Western states, many of them out of control. Every so often a year comes along when conditions favor combustion. The forests and rangeland become as dry as mouse nests, and when thunderstorms pass by, bringing lightning without rain, ignition is inevitable. It happened in 1988, when more than 1.5 million acres of Yellowstone National Park went up in flames. And it is happening again now, thanks to unusually dry vegetation, hot temperatures, low humidity and rainfall, and winds that can fan a small blaze into a conflagration. So far, some four million acres are burning or have already burned, nearly twice the average annual acreage burned in the last 10 years.</p>
        <p>One fire in Washington State was started by an electric fence. Some have been started by human carelessness. Those kinds of causes it is possible to militate against. But in an arid year in a combustible region, after decades of unremitting fire suppression and fuel buildup, every low-pressure system worries firefighters because the lightning it carries is capable of touching off an enormous number of widely separated fires. On one particularly bad day last week, dry thunderstorms generated 75,000 lightning strikes that sparked more than 400 new forest fires across the West.</p>

        <p>The American West is a checkerboard of fires this summer, with some 66 large wildland fires currently burning in 11 Western states, many of them out of control. Every so often a year comes along when conditions favor combustion.

        <p>One fire in Washington State was started by an electric fence. Some have been started by human carelessness. Those kinds of causes it is possible to militate against. But in an arid year in a combustible region, after decades of unremitting fire suppression and fuel buildup, every low-pressure system worries firefighters because the lightning it carries is capable of touching off an enormous number of widely separated fires. On one particularly bad day last week, dry thunderstorms generated 75,000 lightning strikes that sparked more than 400 new forest fires across the West.</p>
        <p>The fires have stretched resources to the breaking point as some 20,000 civilian firefighters have struggled for months to control the flames and have been assisted by military battalions and crews from Canada and Mexico. President Clinton toured the fire scene in the Payette National Forest in Idaho yesterday and said he would release $150 million in emergency funds to fight the fires. It is badly needed. There will be time later to assess whether more should be done in future years to reduce the volume of combustible vegetation in the forests before they can be ignited. For now, the critical need is to bolster the containment efforts. Rain would be a blessing, but even a few days of high humidity and low wind would make a difference. Some of the fires may burn until the snows come.</p>
