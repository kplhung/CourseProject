        <p>A GREAT urban myth is that cabdrivers know the best places to eat. Well, guess what: It's no myth, at least when it comes to northern Indian and Pakistani cabby hangouts, where I've had some very exciting meals in the last few weeks.</p>
        <p>The needs of the on-duty cabby are few: Food must be ready fast, it must be cheap and it must be available around the clock. These three dhabas, as truck stops are known on the northern Indian frontier, meet those standards, and their food is unexpectedly delicious as well, better than at almost any of the fancier Indian neighborhood restaurants.</p>

        <p>A GREAT urban myth is that cabdrivers know the best places to eat. Well, guess what: It's no myth, at least when it comes to northern Indian and Pakistani cabby hangouts, where I've had some very exciting meals in the last few weeks.</p>
        <p>The needs of the on-duty cabby are few: Food must be ready fast, it must be cheap and it must be available around the clock. These three dhabas, as truck stops are known on the northern Indian frontier, meet those standards, and their food is unexpectedly delicious as well, better than at almost any of the fancier Indian neighborhood restaurants.</p>
        <p>None of these places will win style points. But all those cabs parked in front are an unsubtle message to stop, enter and take a chance. The rewards are immense at EAT AGAIN DELI  in Chelsea, which is just a corner deli, right down to the racks of Cheez Doodles and candies. But the display of Bollywood videos and job listings in Hindi give it away. Tucked into the front is one square table, along with a formica counter wrapped around a plastic jug, from which you can pour your own lassi, a thin but refreshing yogurt drink.</p>
        <p>Eat Again is an unfortunate name, but the deli offers the sort of home-cooked foods you rarely find outside of Punjab. For example, makai ki roti is a wonderful grainy flatbread made largely of cornmeal and clarified butter, but I've never seen it in New York except at Eat Again, where it goes beautifully with sarsoon ka saag ($2.50), pureed mustard greens and broccoli cooked down to their creamy essence and flavored with ginger and garlic. Punjabi dahi kadhi ($2.50) is another unusual dish: chickpea fritters served in a pungent, fiery yogurt sauce with mustard and cumin seeds. Chicken curry ($4.50) comes in a milder yogurt sauce, which you can spice up with an excellent mint and cilantro chutney spiked with chili. Or you can grab a small chili from a bowl on the counter.</p>
        <p>In SoHo, across Crosby Street from a big Gaseteria, LAHORE DELI  makes Eat Again look elegant in comparison. It's barely more than a dingy walk-in closet, with a tiny counter, several shelves of candy bars and plastic utensils, and a television showing South Asian movies and music videos. Two vases of plastic flowers provide color. But the flavors of the food are improbably light, clear and true.</p>
        <p>I loved the aloo saag ($4), a light mixture of potatoes and spinach seasoned with cinnamon, cardamom and fennel seeds, and the aloo baigan ($4), a potato-and-eggplant dish spiced just enough to make it flavorful, but with enough restraint to allow the rich flavor of the eggplant to shine through. Each dish was served with a wonderful chickpea dal, creamy and subtly spiced with plenty of flavor, and excellent sand-colored rice.</p>
        <p>BUKHARA  in Kensington, Brooklyn, is the largest of the restaurants, a three-room complex with a bakery, a buffet devoted to Indian and Chinese foods and a separate counter, where you can order a meal and then take a seat in the well-lighted, spacious room. The comfortable tables are covered with linen tablecloths, but place mats are squares of paper toweling.</p>
        <p>Slender okra wands ($3.50) with cumin and coriander were cooked with tomatoes and went beautifully with white rice flavored with white cardamom seeds and a delectably gingery dal made with white lentils and turmeric. Lamb biriyani ($5.50), a simple dish of small chunks of tender meat in rice, transcended the usual versions because of the excellence of the rice, while chicken with spinach ($5.50) was suitably mild and creamy. Lassi ($1.50) was foamy and refreshing.</p>
        <p>Whatever you choose, don't pass up the onion kulcha (75 cents), a wonderful, glossy, golden flatbread dotted with little craters and stuffed with onions. Plain nan ($1.25) was also excellent, made with sesame seeds for a nice crunch.</p>
        <p>I didn't sense much warmth in the welcome at Bukhara, but that's all right. I'll settle for that onion kulcha anytime.</p>
