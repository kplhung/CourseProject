        <p>CRISPNESS and portability rarely go together in hot food. But Thalia Kitchen, the new takeout arm of Thalia, in the theater district, contributes two excellent additions to the carryout repertory. Both dishes can also be eaten at Thalia's bar.</p>
        <p>In the first, freshly ground salmon is blended with onions, scallions, lemon and herbs, then rolled into a ball, breaded and deep-fried. In a brilliant twist, it is served on a stick like a salmon croquette lollipop ($6 for 3) with a tangy remoulade sauce flavored with horseradish and capers. Even a full two hours after these were cooked, they were still crisp.</p>

        <p>In the first, freshly ground salmon is blended with onions, scallions, lemon and herbs, then rolled into a ball, breaded and deep-fried. In a brilliant twist, it is served on a stick like a salmon croquette lollipop ($6 for 3) with a tangy remoulade sauce flavored with horseradish and capers. Even a full two hours after these were cooked, they were still crisp.</p>
        <p>Thalia Kitchen's other standout is shrimp wrapped in extremely thin Chinese pastry and fried until crisp. These are called shrimp rolls ($12 for 6) and are not only crisp but also shrimpy, with no clumsy coating. A hot mustard dipping sauce adds just the right Asian touch.</p>
        <p>The herbed French fries ($4) that the shop serves, though, should never leave it in a carryout container.</p>
        <p>Thalia Kitchen, 828 Eighth Avenue (50th Street entrance), (212) 399-4443. Delivery (except Monday and Tuesday nights): Avenue of the Americas to 10th Avenue, 40th to 60th Street.</p>
