        <p>Scene I: One winter morning before the 1982 season, Dave Collins, his wife and his agent have breakfast at a New York hotel with George Steinbrenner.

        <p>Collins signs with the Yankees anyway, then is told to bring a first baseman's glove to spring training. He does not play as much as he had been promised and is traded before the end of the season.</p>
        <p>Scene II: The day before the snow-delayed season opener in 1982, the Yankees execute a trade for Roy Smalley, the Minnesota Twins' shortstop. ''What am I going to do with him?'' Bob Lemon, the Yankees manager, asks. ''I already have a shortstop.''</p>
        <p>Scene III: The Yankees make so many player changes during that season that even the players have trouble keeping up. ''Which one's Espino?'' Dave Collins asks a reporter, one day, only to be told Juan Espino has already been sent back to the minors.</p>
        <p>Reprise: Jose Canseco, claimed on waivers from Tampa Bay the day before, joined the Yankees yesterday and was summoned to a meeting with Manager Joe Torre in which Glenallen Hill and Luis Polonia were also invited.</p>
        <p>''I asked them to be patient,'' Torre said. ''I know they've all been regular players.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees, World Series winners the last two years and three of the last four, have saddled themselves with a bulging platoon of designated hitters. The rules allow for only one D.H. in the lineup per game. The Yankees have also engaged in a turnover of players that resembles the 1982 season, when players were stockpiled upon players and the revolving door in the clubhouse was constantly turning.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing to watch,'' Chuck Knoblauch, the disabled second baseman/designated hitter and new team stand-up comic, said before last night's game with Oakland. ''It's a totally different team. That's why we haven't taken a team picture yet. We're just waiting.''</p>
        <p>When he returns from the disabled list, Knoblauch added, ''My locker will be in the auxiliary clubhouse.''</p>
        <p>Canseco, a veteran of 15 major league seasons and producer of 440 home runs, was assigned a locker in the main clubhouse, but that is all he was guaranteed.</p>
        <p>''I kind of wondered what role I'd have, how was I going to fit in here,'' Canseco said.</p>
        <p>Did he know what his role would be? ''I have no idea,'' he said. ''I'm kind of in a spot not really knowing what exactly is going on.''</p>
        <p>Canseco quickly learned his initial role. He was called on to bat for Luis Sojo, who also joined the team yesterday, with the bases loaded, two out in the seventh inning and the Yankees trailing, 3-2.</p>
        <p>Yankee Stadium fans, seeing Sojo head back toward the dugout, began cheering before Canseco emerged and continued cheering while he took some swings in the on-deck circle, then went to the plate.</p>
        <p>''It was a very positive reaction,'' Canseco said later. ''I appreciate that.''</p>
        <p>He did not, on the other hand, appreciate the 2-1 pitch from Jim Mecir.</p>
        <p>''The adrenaline was definitely pumping,'' Canseco said. ''I worked the count to 2-0. He threw me a high sinker and I fouled it back. I knew that was probably the pitch I should've hit. The next pitch was a hard sinker that ran in really late. I told myself to try to drive the ball straightaway. It got in on me pretty good.''</p>
        <p>The pitch broke Canseco's bat, and he popped a fly ball to right field, ending the threat. The out gave Canseco a 6-for-36 record (.167) as a pinch-hitter in a 6,691 at-bat career. He said he couldn't remember the last time he batted for someone else, but it was only three months ago, May 4 against Texas, when Francisco Cordero of Texas struck him out in the 10th inning of a tied game.</p>
        <p>After his night's work was done, Canseco stayed and watched Bernie Williams and David Justice hit consecutive-pitch home runs against Jason Isringhausen in the ninth inning for a 4-3 victory.</p>
        <p>''Isringhausen came in throwing 95 miles an hour,'' Canseco said. ''All of a sudden, one pitch out, next pitch out. It was, like, it's over? That quick? It was a pretty awesome ending.''</p>
        <p>Even in the flush of his first experience with the Yankees, Canseco might have felt better about his presence in their uniform had the Yankees claimed him because they wanted him. But he was told they claimed him to block him from going to a rival team.</p>
        <p>''I'd definitely rather play where I'm wanted,'' he said in response to a question during a pregame session with reporters.</p>
        <p>The Yankees may yet decide they don't like being top heavy with designated hitters. They may decide to put Canseco back on waivers with the idea of having a friendly, nonthreatening foe claim him, maybe even agreeing to pay most of the approximately $1 million in salary he is owed for the rest of the season.</p>
        <p>But if he remains and if pinch-hitting is the role he is asked to perform?</p>
        <p>''It is what it is,'' Canseco said. ''I can't control it. I'm going to be happy and content with whatever I get. Whatever part I do get here I'm going to make the best of it.''</p>
        <p>Torre said he doesn't have a set plan but added, ''It's nice to have ammunition off the bench where you can make a change like that.''</p>
