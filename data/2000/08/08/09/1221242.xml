        <p>Call it a New York state of mind.</p>
        <p>Three days into the strike by more than 86,000 employees of the nation's largest local telephone company, spanning the region from Maine to Virginia, the most strident and sometimes violent front lines of the walkout have been in New York City and its suburbs.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the company, Verizon Communications, said it had reported 455 strike-related incidents of assault, harassment and vandalism to the police in 12 states and the District of Columbia -- with more than half of them in New York State.</p>
        <p>The first two strike-related arrests were made in New York yesterday. And last evening, New York State Supreme Court Judge Louis York, in Manhattan, granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order, effective through next Monday, that bars picketers from preventing managers or replacement workers from entering their offices or carrying out work assignments.</p>
        <p>The flare-ups, ranging from egg throwing to arson, have come amid a scorching spell of heat and humidity that descended on the New York metropolitan area on Sunday, shortening tempers just as the strike began. The weather may help explain why the city, which lately has prided itself on a steep drop in crime, was rocked on Sunday night by a wave of violence, including 20 shootings and 4 murders, that had nothing to do with the strike,</p>
        <p>But experts say outbreaks along picket lines and evidence of strike-related vandalism in New York point to broader, farther-reaching factors in the nation's largest city and communications capital, where a rapid technological new-economy shift into nonunionized wireless and Internet communications jobs is running head on into a long tradition of union activism.</p>
        <p>''This is the place where the unions will have their impact,'' said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban studies and a telecommunications expert at New York University. ''The density of the city means that a small disruption can have an enormous effect.'</p>
        <p>Last night, the company declined to estimate how many of several thousand residential phone lines in New York City were still out of service because of vandalism that had occurred since the strike began early Sunday. Union leaders have denied member involvement in any network vandalism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moss said the unionized Verizon workers, many of them schooled in strike tactics through years of employment at AT&amp;T and Nynex (which merged with Verizon's predecessor, Bell Atlantic in 1997), hold a particularly potent weapon in New York because of their knowledge of the intricacies the city's telecommunications wiring -- and because of the wide publicity they are assured if the network is disrupted.</p>
        <p>''They know the infrastructure because they built it,'' he said. ''And since this is the media capital of the world, you get more sympathy from other union workers than you would anywhere else.''</p>
        <p>That logic was apparently not lost yesterday on a striking Verizon worker, who gave his name only as Jerry, and who was involved in a confrontation outside a Verizon maintenance garage on King Street in the SoHo section of Manhattan. Accounts varied, but the incident resulted in a maintenance truck's being battered and stuck under a electronic gate that witnesses said had been lowered by strikers, who had access to the gate's remote control box. A nonunion Verizon contractor, who was in the truck, was not injured. No arrests were made.</p>
        <p>''Every now and then it gets tense,'' said Jerry, a member of the Communication Workers of America. ''But we know that a large majority of jobs in this industry will go wireless, and it is only the union that can give us a future.''</p>
        <p>Besides winning the court injunction, the company responded to union violence by increasing a $10,000 reward it began offering on Sunday for information leading to convictions for strike-related vandalism. The new bounty is $25,000.</p>
        <p>''We certainly have evidence the our management workers have experienced abuse from the pickets, sometimes dangerously so,'' said Eric Rabe, a Verizon spokesman. Similar injunctions had been issued by state courts in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island on Monday, the company said.</p>
        <p>In one of yesterday's arrests in New York, a picketing worker was charged with disorderly conduct outside Verizon's Manhattan headquarters at 6th Avenue and 42nd Street, after the police said he refused to remain behind a barricade.</p>
        <p>In the other incident, the police department said a striking worker was charged with petty larceny after removing lug nuts from the wheels of a Verizon maintenance truck on West 15th Street.</p>
        <p>Verizon said yesterday that it had received reports of 143 incidents of vandalism or harassment involving its employees or equipment within New York City since the strike began, and believed at least 115 might have involved criminal activity.</p>
        <p>But a spokeswoman in Washington for the Communications Workers of America, Candice Johnson, said Verizon might be exaggerating the disruption caused by the strike.</p>
