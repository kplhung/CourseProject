        <p>Correction of July 28 article about review of 1993 slaying of Mexican cardinal, Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, which referred incorrectly to conclusions of two bishops; bishops, unlike some Roman Catholic leaders, shared view of prosecutors that killing occurred when drug traffickers mistook him for rival and was not intentional</p>
