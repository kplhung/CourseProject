        <p>For the first time, women users of the Internet outnumbered men online, at least in the first quarter of 2000, making up just over 50.4 percent of all users, according to a survey to be released today by Media Metrix and Jupiter Communications. The biggest increase during the period -- 125 percent -- was among teenage girls, while the number of women 18 to 24 years old dropped during the quarter. The survey also showed women and men behave differently online. Women tend to spend their time online on the same few sites, rather than surfing.</p>
