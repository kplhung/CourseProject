        <p>Police Commissioner Howard Safir formally announced his resignation yesterday, relinquishing command of the largest police department in the nation to work as a salaried consultant for ChoicePoint Inc., a corporate investigations firm in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>The commissioner said his final day at 1 Police Plaza would be Aug. 18, ending a 31-year career in the public sector and nearly 4 1/2 years as one of the city's most prominent officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir, who has supervised the New York Police Department during a period when crime declined markedly but relations between the police and many minority residents seemed to sour, appeared with his wife, Carol, in a ceremonial chamber in City Hall, where he thanked Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the officers under his command.</p>
        <p>He suggested that his legacy was apparent on the city's streets, in what he described as the professionalism of police officers and their success in rolling back crime.</p>
        <p>''I have had the privilege, thanks to Mayor Giuliani, of leading the best men and women in law enforcement in the world,'' he said. ''What they have done for this city is not only evident in the fact that we are not only the No. 1 tourist destination in the United States, but also evident in every neighborhood -- whether it's Brooklyn or Queens or Staten Island or the Bronx -- where crime is the lowest it has been in three decades.''</p>
        <p>At the end of his remarks, he received a sustained standing ovation from six rows of senior police officials. Mr. Giuliani, his friend of 25 years, looked on approvingly.</p>
        <p>The mayor, who leaves office in 16 months, would not discuss whom he might select to replace Mr. Safir, but senior police officials said the successor would probably be announced in the next few days, and certainly before the end of next week.</p>
        <p>Even as the City Hall ceremony for Mr. Safir was ending yesterday, other city officials and Mr. Safir's critics were calling news conferences of their own, at which they offered a starkly different interpretation of the commissioner's record.</p>
        <p>Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, said Mr. Safir had lost his way by focusing too much on the statistical measures of police productivity instead of on the impact some of his policies had in the city's neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>''There was an overemphasis on statistics,'' Mr. Vallone said. ''The next commissioner should be concerned about numbers and about people.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Al Sharpton said Mr. Safir's legacy was one of tolerating violent officers and encouraging aggressive tactics, a combination that sometimes ended in tragedy, as in the station house torture of Abner Louima and the deaths of Amadou Diallo, Patrick M. Dorismond and two other unarmed black men who were fatally shot by the police during one 13-month period.</p>
        <p>''He presided over some of the worst, most graphic police brutality cases in memory,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''His leaving will not cause any regret at all in our community.''</p>
        <p>Consistent with past form, Mr. Safir seemed unfazed by his critics, and even eager to dismiss them. As he left City Hall, where aides of Mark Green, the public advocate, were distributing fliers announcing a news conference at which Mr. Green later criticized him, Mr. Safir was asked for his feelings. He said, ''Mark Green is a joke, he has always been a joke, and he continues to be a joke.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir, 58, announced in May that he was suffering from prostate cancer. But he said yesterday that his illness was treatable and that his health had no bearing on his decision to resign. Rather, he said, ChoicePoint approached him this year and asked him to join the company and use his contacts in various law enforcement agencies to develop sales. He decided to accept the offer about a month ago, he said, and informed the mayor then.</p>
        <p>ChoicePoint, a publicly traded corporation with 4,000 employees in 22 cities, provides various forms of intelligence to government and corporate clients, including results of employees' drug tests and background screening of potential vendors. It is one of the country's largest pre-employment screeners, with gross revenues of $430 million last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir would not discuss the salary he would be earning, but mentioned at least twice that he was attracted to ChoicePoint because it was ''dedicated to improving society, not just to making money.'' He also said he was interested in working for the company because it would allow him to continue advocating for more extensive use of forensic DNA in law enforcement. Mr. Safir said he would be creating the DNA unit for the company and would very likely open a New York office.</p>
        <p>In addition to working for ChoicePoint, Mr. Safir said, he will join the board of Investigative and Protective Services of America International, an Atlanta-based investigation firm, as well as work part time for his wife's company, the November Group, which does international product licensing for domestic goods.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir, who said he was not eligible for a city pension and had no intention of seeking one, is one of several senior police officials who will be leaving the department almost simultaneously. Patrick E. Kelleher, the first deputy commissioner, will retire next week. Martin B. O'Boyle, the deputy commissioner who supervises the Organized Crime Control Bureau, and Michael A. Markman, chief of personnel, have also submitted retirement papers in recent days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir said yesterday that the departures would not have an adverse effect on the department.</p>
        <p>''It is a lot of experience leaving,'' he said. ''But the fact is that this is a very deep organization, filled with many talented people, and the institution will do just fine.''</p>
