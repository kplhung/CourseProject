        <p>WHAT a country! It has come to accept the idea that a Jew can aspire to a national office that one former occupant, John Nance Garner, is popularly said to have described as not ''worth a pitcher of warm spit.''</p>
        <p>Just think. Assuming he gets to be vice president -- and equally important, assuming that Jewish Sabbath rules do not interfere -- Joseph I. Lieberman can fill America's need to have someone of high rank who can fly off on short notice to watch foreign potentates being laid to rest.</p>
        <p>Call this a cynical view of the milestone we have reached, the ascension of a Jew to the national ticket of a major political party. Blame John Adams. It was no less than the first vice president who wrote in 1793, ''My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived.''</p>
        <p>Granted, a lot has changed since 1793. While the vice presidency may still not be much, all fate has to do is shrug its shoulders to turn the job into everything.</p>
        <p>The real point is that even as one makes obeisance to the history made this week, Jews have already held national offices of true power, here and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''This 'only in America' is an exaggeration,'' said Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, the Bronfman Visiting Professor of the Humanities at New York University. He cited Leon Blum, prime minister of France in the 1930's, and Benjamin Disraeli, the 19th-century prime minister of Britain, who was of Jewish origins though brought up as a Christian.</p>
        <p>In this country, Henry Kissinger, a German-born Jew, held far greater sway than any vice president. And while he was widely criticized for his policies as secretary of state in the 1970's, Rabbi Hertzberg said, ''nobody raised the Jewish issue with him.''</p>
        <p>Other prominent Jews in New York have made similar points since the Gore-Lieberman ticket took shape on Monday. This move by the Democrats, they said, is less a breakthrough than an affirmation of the relative security that Jews -- and many other ethnic groups, for that matter -- now enjoy.</p>
        <p>''There's less Jewish pride,'' said Norman Podhoretz, editor at large of Commentary magazine, ''than confirmation of the feeling that has become more and more widespread, which is that Jews have found a home in America to a degree they never have in any other country during 2,000 years of the Diaspora.''</p>
        <p>Still, nobody's kidding himself. That an observant Jew might be the next vice president was enough of a novelty to set all sorts of wheels spinning.</p>
        <p>NOT surprisingly, most Jews were proud of Mr. Lieberman, though some acknowledged that their insecurity buttons were pushed, touching off silent alarms that ring for them whenever Jews become too visible.</p>
        <p>Also not surprisingly, anti-Semitic cybernuts were out in force. These are the kinds of people who used to send ranting letters in crayon to newspapers. Now, Heaven help us, they have Internet chat rooms.</p>
        <p>It was predictable, perhaps, that some news organizations would offer primers on what it means to be an Orthodox Jew (a well-intentioned effort but not a particularly helpful one, since Jews themselves have been arguing over this for, oh, centuries).</p>
        <p>It certainly was predictable that the Jewish jokes would start, from Letterman and Leno routines to a cartoon in The Daily News yesterday showing Mr. Lieberman as a fiddler on the White House roof. One fellow from the Heritage Foundation managed, in talking to The New York Post, to cram three Yiddish words into a single sentence.</p>
        <p>Did anyone say, ''Oy''?</p>
        <p>You can probably count on all this continuing into the fall. October could be interesting. It is filled with Jewish holy days, and if he is true to his faith, Mr. Lieberman will skip at least half a dozen days of campaigning, the Sandy Koufax of politics. For better or worse, this is likely to be the most heavily televised Sukkot in history.</p>
        <p>''It's going to take some time for all of us to get accustomed to this,'' said Phil Baum, director of the American Jewish Congress. But he added, ''America's not quite as provincial as it used to be, and Lieberman is not going to be seen as some kind of bizarre creature.''</p>
        <p>Maybe someday nobody will care about any of this. But we are not there yet.</p>
        <p>It was hard not to notice yesterday that as the first Jewish vice-presidential candidate was introduced, New York's first Jewish police commissioner was resigning. As Rabbi Akiva, the great second-century scholar, probably never said: You win some, you lose some.</p>
