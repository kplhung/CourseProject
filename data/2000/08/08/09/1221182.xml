        <p>ANYONE who misses the gaudy sign for Ping's Seafood on Mott Street gets the message a few steps inside the restaurant. Near the door, a high-rise of stacked fish tanks offers the menu headliners, a stellar cast that includes but is by no means limited to lobsters, eels, scallops, sea bass and shrimp. One evening, I stood transfixed by a school of small goblinlike fish with the features of a toad. In the tank just above, looking like a princess in an aquatic fairy tale, a single, delicate prawn stood upright, took little mincing steps, and waved its delicate pink feelers, as though flustered.</p>
        <p>The seafood in the tanks ends up on your plate at Ping's, pretty much shortcutting the freshness issue. The preparations are minimal -- a ginger-garlic sauce for the lobster, for example, or black bean sauce for the eel -- and the results are maximal. Shrimp in the shell, crackling crisp and salty, come to the table piping hot, exhaling a delicate, fragrant steam. You eat the shells, which crunch and then melt. Scallops, quickly steamed, come in three choices of sauce: garlic, black bean or XO, a Hong Kong innovation that's sweet and sour, hot and salty. Ping's XO is superlative, dense with tiny bits of dried shrimp and chilies.</p>

        <p>ANYONE who misses the gaudy sign for Ping's Seafood on Mott Street gets the message a few steps inside the restaurant. Near the door, a high-rise of stacked fish tanks offers the menu headliners, a stellar cast that includes but is by no means limited to lobsters, eels, scallops, sea bass and shrimp. One evening, I stood transfixed by a school of small goblinlike fish with the features of a toad. In the tank just above, looking like a princess in an aquatic fairy tale, a single, delicate prawn stood upright, took little mincing steps, and waved its delicate pink feelers, as though flustered.</p>
        <p>The seafood in the tanks ends up on your plate at Ping's, pretty much shortcutting the freshness issue. The preparations are minimal -- a ginger-garlic sauce for the lobster, for example, or black bean sauce for the eel -- and the results are maximal. Shrimp in the shell, crackling crisp and salty, come to the table piping hot, exhaling a delicate, fragrant steam. You eat the shells, which crunch and then melt. Scallops, quickly steamed, come in three choices of sauce: garlic, black bean or XO, a Hong Kong innovation that's sweet and sour, hot and salty. Ping's XO is superlative, dense with tiny bits of dried shrimp and chilies.</p>
        <p>Ping's, which opened a little more than two months ago, has two siblings, on Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst and on East Broadway in Chinatown. The chef and owner, Chung Ping Hui, grew up in Hong Kong and made his reputation cooking at Triple Eight Palace in Chinatown before striking out on his own. Now, he has come back from Queens to concentrate on his newest restaurant, and the personal touch shows. There's a palpable elan in the air. The waiters seem not overjoyed (that would be too pushy and demonstrative), but quietly pleased at the food they're bringing out, setting dishes on the table to a chorus of oohs and aahs before whisking them aside to be divided into individual portions.</p>
        <p>As at his two other restaurants, the chef focuses on the cuisine he grew up with, and he makes no attempt to protect American customers from exotic, possibly frightening ingredients. The menu makes a point of putting duck's tongue, jellyfish, pig's stomach and assorted funguses front and center, right along with the Sichuan crowd-pleasers that have nothing to do with the rest of the menu. The waiters and managers, a very gregarious bunch, love to talk about ingredients and explain the fine points. Unusual for a Chinatown restaurant, they dare you to try things. For the adventurous eater, the quirky and often experimental food of Hong Kong always stands as a welcome challenge; for example, a special stand-alone menu offers seven or eight types of abalone, fresh or dried, Australian or Japanese. The highest-priced abalone, from Japan, costs $108 for a four-ounce serving. Braised in oyster sauce and served in a little casserole, it has a firm, velvety texture and a robust flavor just this side of liver.</p>
        <p>Duck's tongue, served braised or deep-fried, is chewy, rich and a touch gamy, with an off-putting spear of cartilage in the center that must be discreetly removed. I find the tongues more trouble than they are worth, but pork belly is another matter. Ping's excels at stir-fried dishes, and the pig's stomach with dried squid in shallot sauce is a sterling example. Another winner is one of the house signatures, a rather simple stir-fry of squid cut into long strands woven together with dried fish and crunchy matchsticks of jicama and celery.</p>
        <p>Deep-fried dishes come out a little on the heavy side, like the shrimp with flat diamond-shaped slices of yam in a sweet batter, which quickly becomes cloying. Bean curd, however, escapes the deep-fry curse. Stuffed with shrimp paste, it has a delicate crunch outside, a creamy fluffiness inside, with a shrimp surprise at the center. Even better was a bizarre-seeming but characteristic Hong Kong dish, deep-fried shrimp smeared with mayonnaise and served with deep-fried milk custard. The mayonnaise and custard, similar in texture but opposite in taste, made their own weird harmony, nicely offset by quick-boiled broccoli florets.</p>
        <p>One of the more appealing rituals at Ping's is winter melon soup. One Friday night, the restaurant was filled almost entirely with Asian families, and at each table sat an enormous green gourd, sliced in half and generating clouds of steam. A waiter carefully cut away slices of the melon flesh and added them to each bowlful of the soup he ladled out, then cut away the walls of the melon until, as the soup made the rounds, the melon disappeared.</p>
        <p>I ordered one, calling a day ahead, since the melon, which flourishes in the summer despite its name, has to steam for six hours. It came as promised, a bulging green bowl brimming with what initially seemed nothing more than a mild-flavored chicken stock. The melon flesh, similar in color and texture to honeydew, was also subtly flavored and slightly sweet. As the ladle dipped deeper into the gourd, interesting things began to emerge -- bits of fresh scallop and dried scallop, ham, dried white fungus, shrimp, frog and crab. Even more than the fish tanks, this seemed like the perfect emblem for Ping's, an exotic package with thrilling secrets inside.</p>
