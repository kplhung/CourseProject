        <p>Editorial backs proposal by Securities and Exchange Commission Chmn Arthur Levitt jr to bar senior corporate executives from disclosing important financial data to select securities analysts without releasing data to public</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has fought consistently to strip Wall Street insiders of ill-gotten advantage. His latest target is ''selective disclosure'' -- release by corporate executives of important financial information to a select group of securities analysts or institutional investors. Those warned, for example, of falling earnings can rush out and advise their clients to sell shares. By the time ordinary investors hear the bad news, the stock price has already sunk.</p>
        <p>The four S.E.C. commissioners will vote tomorrow on a proposed rule that would prevent senior executives from making important disclosures to selected analysts without releasing the data to the public. The securities industry opposes the idea because, it says, the rule would ''chill'' the exchange of information between companies and investors. But the current draft of the proposed rule addresses the securities industry's legitimate qualms.</p>

        <p>Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has fought consistently to strip Wall Street insiders of ill-gotten advantage. His latest target is ''selective disclosure'' -- release by corporate executives of important financial information to a select group of securities analysts or institutional investors. Those warned, for example, of falling earnings can rush out and advise their clients to sell shares. By the time ordinary investors hear the bad news, the stock price has already sunk.</p>
        <p>The four S.E.C. commissioners will vote tomorrow on a proposed rule that would prevent senior executives from making important disclosures to selected analysts without releasing the data to the public. The securities industry opposes the idea because, it says, the rule would ''chill'' the exchange of information between companies and investors. But the current draft of the proposed rule addresses the securities industry's legitimate qualms.</p>
        <p>It would, for example, exempt information released to journalists and information that analysts obtain from non-senior executives, an exemption designed to encourage analysts to dig for a broad range of data. The proposed rule protects corporations from punishment for inadvertent slips by giving them up to 24 hours to make information publicly available that they unintentionally shared with a select audience. The proposed rule also protects companies against excessive litigation. It would leave enforcement up to the commission, rather than to private lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Commissioners Levitt and Paul Carey are expected to vote in favor of the proposed rule. Commissioner Laura Unger may well vote no. That probably leaves the fate of the measure up to Commissioner Isaac Hunt. Securities markets work well in the United States in part because investors large and small can be confident they are being treated fairly. Mr. Levitt's proposal would bolster that confidence.</p>
