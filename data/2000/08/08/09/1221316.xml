        <p>THE PRIMARIES</p>
        <p>A CLAY FAMILY TRADITION  In a five-way race to succeed retiring Representative William L. Clay, Democrat of Missouri, the congressman's 44-year-old son, State Senator William L. Clay Jr., won the Democratic primary yesterday in the First Congressional District. The race had been expected to be close, but Mr. Clay won handily, sweeping the St. Louis portion of the district and elsewhere running slightly ahead of his main rival, Charlie Dooley, a member of the St. Louis County Council.</p>

        <p>THE PRIMARIES</p>
        <p>A CLAY FAMILY TRADITION  In a five-way race to succeed retiring Representative William L. Clay, Democrat of Missouri, the congressman's 44-year-old son, State Senator William L. Clay Jr., won the Democratic primary yesterday in the First Congressional District. The race had been expected to be close, but Mr. Clay won handily, sweeping the St. Louis portion of the district and elsewhere running slightly ahead of his main rival, Charlie Dooley, a member of the St. Louis County Council.</p>
        <p>The race had been closely watched because it could determine how Missouri's Congressional districts are redrawn next year, particularly the First District and the adjacent Third District of Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader.</p>
        <p>In St. Louis County, which accounts for about two-third of the district's population, Mr. Clay won about 47 percent of the vote, with Mr. Dooley securing 40 percent, with 97 percent of the precincts reporting, according to unofficial results from the Board of Elections. In the city of St. Louis, Mr. Clay beat Mr. Dooley  by a margin of about seven-to-one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clay's victory is likely to put pressure on the Missouri Legislature to preserve the district's St. Louis neighborhoods. A victory by Mr. Dooley might have resulted in a shift of the district's boundaries farther into the suburbs of St. Louis County. That would have enabled legislators to extend Mr. Gephardt's district north, into the heavily black -- and securely Democratic -- terrain of St. Louis.</p>

        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>MAKING UP FOR THE PAST  In a step toward atoning for what many Democrats agree was one of their party's biggest political blunders, the party has invited the sons of the late Robert P. Casey to speak at next week's convention in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Casey, the former governor of Pennsylvania, had asked to speak at the 1992 Democratic convention in New York and deliver a report opposing the party's platform, which called ''reproductive choice'' a ''fundamental right.'' But the nominees -- Bill Clinton and Al Gore -- wanted the convention to send a message of unity for abortion rights, and Mr. Casey was barred from speaking.</p>
        <p>Now, with the approval of Mr. Gore, this year's nominee, the party has invited two of Mr. Casey's sons -- Robert P. Casey Jr., who is facing re-election as Pennsylvania's auditor general, and Patrick Casey, a candidate for Congress from Scranton -- to participate in a video tribute to their father at the convention.</p>

        <p>THE ENDORSEMENTS</p>
        <p>GORE WINS U.A.W. BACKING  The United Auto Workers announced yesterday that it would endorse Vice President Al Gore for president, ending its feud with him over trade and giving him a boost in Michigan and other industrial Midwestern states.</p>
        <p>Democratic officials said Mr. Gore and the union president, Stephen P. Yokich, who had flirted with Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, had spoken in recent months in an effort to agree on trade and environmental issues. Among other things, the union succeeded in adding language to the platform saying Mr. Gore would push for more fuel-efficient cars ''in a way that preserves and creates jobs for American workers and delivers products that consumers want to buy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore will travel to Michigan, which has 450,000 current and retired U.A.W. members, on Friday to accept the endorsement.</p>

        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>G.O.P. FIRES BACK  The Republican Party has begun running its first attack ad, a 30-second commercial  accusing Vice President Al Gore of hypocrisy on environmental issues. The spot contends that Mr. Gore has been distorting Gov. George W. Bush's environmental record in Texas and, citing a recent biography, reports that Mr. Gore ''has allowed mining companies to mine zinc from his property'' in Tennessee.</p>
        <p>Republican officials are spending $3.7 million to run their new spot in 17 states: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.</p>
