        <p>ALL summer long, weary business travelers have been grimly playing the numbers game. Here's a question from the most recent round: How many flights did UAL's United Airlines abruptly cancel last Saturday, Sunday and Monday? The answer: 814.</p>
        <p>United's no-fly statistics have become truly impressive, even in this worst-ever summer for airline passengers. However, the airline industry in general is not having such a bad summer. Most carriers are flying record numbers of customers.</p>
        <p>Before the summer rush got under way, United -- which has about 2,500 departures a day -- had already lopped a total of 4,800 flights off its schedule through August, and the airline recently said it was cutting almost 2,000 flights out of its September schedule.</p>
        <p>United blames the delays and cancellations largely on a job action by pilots who are refusing to work some overtime shifts. The pilots' union disputes that, however, saying that the company itself has caused the problems by not taking action to remedy what the union says is a shortage of pilots.</p>
        <p>Business travelers, meanwhile,  face the next round in the numbers game this week, when the Federal Aviation Administration releases data for delays in July. The delays in June smashed all previous records.</p>
        <p>Will the July numbers set still another record? Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
        <p>An F.A.A. spokesman, Bill Shuman, wasn't quoting any odds yesterday. ''July is going to be up there,'' he said. ''The weather has been bad. It really affected travel between Chicago and other points in the Midwest and the whole Northeast corridor, Boston to Washington.''</p>
        <p>And while we're playing the numbers, here are some long-range ones to contemplate as air travel grows and we try to figure out how to safety and efficiently thread an increasing number of planes through a finite amount of air space.</p>
        <p>World air travel, measured by the total number of miles flown by airline passengers, will grow 4.8 percent a year for the next 20 years, according to the newly released 2000 Current Market Outlook, an annual report on the commercial aviation business published by Boeing.</p>
        <p>What's more, as air traffic control systems in the United States and abroad struggle to keep up, the total number of commercial airplanes plying the world skies is expected to more than double -- to more than 31,000 from 13,670 last year -- by 2019, according to Boeing. The aircraft manufacturer predicts that the domestic and global long-haul air markets now served by big-capacity aircraft will increasingly fragment into more direct routes flown by greater numbers of smaller-capacity regional and long-range jets.</p>
        <p>''Congestion is a significant issue facing the industry today,'' Randolph S. Baseler, vice president for marketing at Boeing's commercial airplane division, said recently in a speech to industry officials.</p>
        <p>''Some are suggesting that very large airplanes represent a solution,'' he said. But he added that that larger planes like 747's ''actually contribute to airport congestion,'' since half or more of their passenger loads can be dependent on a variety of feeder connecting flights.</p>
        <p>Boeing, obviously, would like to sell more new planes, including more smaller-capacity regional jets. Domestic carriers are putting more regional jets in the air each year. The total number of these smaller jets, Mr. Baseler said, will more than double as a percentage of the world's commercial aviation fleet within 20 years.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, while we're considering the prospects for ever more planes to move from one point to another in the ever-crowded skies, let's consider one more set of numbers, down to earth and trivial as they may be in the grand scheme of things.</p>
        <p>While the domestic airspace backed up with those record delays in June, Amtrak recorded its highest ridership gain for a three-month period since 1991 -- up 8 percent, to six million passengers. And the gains weren't all in the heavily traveled Northeast corridor. Long-distance trains had a 5 percent increase in riders, the rail company said. The strongest performer of all: the Texas Eagle, which runs between Chicago and San Antonio, up 49 percent.</p>
