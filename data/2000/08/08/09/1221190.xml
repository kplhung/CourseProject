        <p>Meeting Ground</p>
        <p>Two powerful cultures and dance forms -- not to mention a few male egos -- will collide tonight when Company Jant-Bi makes its American debut at Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass. In a new work, ''Le Coq Est Mort,'' in which German dance meets African dance, the West African troupe will express men's striving for power, reminiscent of the all-male ensemble that Ted Shawn, the festival's founder, created in the 1930's. Eight dancers from Senegal and Nigeria will explore problems with dependency via the choreography of the German neo-expressionist Susanne Linke. Information: (413) 243-0745.</p>

        <p>Meeting Ground</p>
        <p>Two powerful cultures and dance forms -- not to mention a few male egos -- will collide tonight when Company Jant-Bi makes its American debut at Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass. In a new work, ''Le Coq Est Mort,'' in which German dance meets African dance, the West African troupe will express men's striving for power, reminiscent of the all-male ensemble that Ted Shawn, the festival's founder, created in the 1930's.

        <p>The Mild Side</p>
        <p>She founded her career on Lower East Side bohemia as Maureen in ''Rent'' and solidified it on cocaine addiction as Kate in the Manhattan Theater Club's ''Wild Party.'' Beginning tomorrow, Idina Menzel will venture into tamer waters as Dorothy, a war bride, in the premiere of ''Summer of '42'' at Goodspeed-at-Chester/The Norma Terris Theater in Chester, Conn. Based on Herman Raucher's novel and his 1971 film about a 15-year-old, played by Ryan Driscoll, and the older woman he falls in love with, the musical, will run through Sept. 3. Information: (860) 873-8668.</p>
        <p>Something for Everyone</p>
        <p>Bored with Broadway? Tonight, the little guys move uptown with the Midtown International Theater Festival. Its mission is ''to bring together in one convenient place the best that Off Off Broadway theater has to offer.'' It will present 9 performances each of 19 productions at 4 locations within four blocks of Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street. The roster ranges from classic Shakespeare to Pinter. The festival runs through Sept. 3. Information: (212) 279-4200.</p>
        <p>Beethoven's World</p>
        <p>His works are a mainstay of the modern concert hall, but even Beethoven still leaves a little to the imagination. Starting Friday, the 11th annual Bard Music Festival will dissect the music and the man in a two-weekend survey at Bard College at Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. Directed by Leon Botstein and Robert Martin, ''Beethoven and His World'' focuses on the little-known works through concerts, symposiums and panel discussions. Eleven performances feature soloists like the pianist Helene Grimaud, the tenor John Aler and the pianist Charles Rosen. Information: (845) 758-3226.</p>
