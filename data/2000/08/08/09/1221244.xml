        <p>United Airlines canceled more than 200 flights nationwide today, disrupting service for thousands of passengers for the fourth consecutive day.</p>
        <p>The cancellations came after a tumultuous weekend in which United, the world's largest airline, was racked by delays and canceled about 600 flights, or about 15 percent of its weekend service, because of what the company said was inclement weather in the East and Midwest and a continuing pilot shortage.</p>

        <p>United Airlines canceled more than 200 flights nationwide today, disrupting service for thousands of passengers for the fourth consecutive day.</p>
        <p>The cancellations came after a tumultuous weekend in which United, the world's largest airline, was racked by delays and canceled about 600 flights, or about 15 percent of its weekend service, because of what the company said was inclement weather in the East and Midwest and a continuing pilot shortage.</p>
        <p>The difficulties of the last week come at a time when airline delays in the United States are on the rise and United is promoting itself as an official sponsor of the Democratic National Convention, which begins next week in Los Angeles. United has been hurt far worse by delays than other carriers. Its flights arrived on time only 57 percent of the time in May, the last month for which statistics are available, and it has had a record number of cancellations.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Rono Dutta, the president of the UAL Corporation, the parent of United, issued a public apology to passengers, saying the airline deeply regretted the ''pain and suffering'' the delays and cancellations had caused.</p>
        <p>And today, Chris Brathwaite, a United spokesman, said the company was continuing to negotiate with representatives of the airline's 10,000 pilots, many of whom have refused to work overtime since their contract expired in April.</p>
        <p>Asked whether United's troubles could affect service to Los Angeles for the Democratic National Convention, Mr. Brathwaite said: ''I really couldn't say. We're going to do the best we can to get people to the convention.''</p>
        <p>Since United's contract with its pilots expired, the airline has been plagued by a shortage of pilots willing to work overtime. And since the contract with maintenance workers expired in July, United executives have complained about a rise in maintenance delays.</p>
        <p>As a result, several weeks ago, the company announced that it would reduce its schedule of flights by about 3 percent in the hopes of ensuring that it had enough pilots.</p>
        <p>United, which schedules about 2,400 flights a day, has been reducing its flight schedule since May. And in September and October, United plans to reduce its flight schedule by 4,000. Those flights, the company says, will not be reinstated even if contract negotiations are successful.</p>
        <p>Herb Hunter, a United pilot and a member of the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents United, said today that weather was a chief cause of the weekend troubles. But he also said United failed to hire enough pilots.</p>
        <p>''We've said all along that we've had staffing problems coming into the summer,'' he said. ''But I applaud the company for cutting back some flights.''</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts say the contract negotiations and weekend cancellations have made things particularly ugly at United.</p>
        <p>''This has been a lingering issue at United going back to April,'' said Samuel C. Buttrick, who follows United for PaineWebber. ''And unfortunately this comes under the broad headline of 'labor negotiations.' ''</p>
        <p>The cancellations and reductions in flights are going to come at a huge cost, Mr. Buttrick said, somewhere between $120 million and $150 million in pretax profits in the third quarter, he said. Wall Street analysts are also worried that United's contract disputes could hurt UAL, which announced in May that it would acquire US Airways for $4.3 billion.</p>
