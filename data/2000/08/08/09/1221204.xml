        <p>Bond prices rose yesterday after a better-than-expected government report on productivity and labor costs and a good start to the Treasury's quarterly debt sales.</p>
        <p>The productivity report increased optimism that the Federal Reserve would leave rates alone when its policy makers meet on Aug. 22. The fresh supply of government debt kept an early cap on the day's gains, but good results helped lift prices later to session highs. The Treasury sold $10 billion of 5-year notes and plans to auction $10 billion of 10-year notes today and $5 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Solid auction results on the five-year maturity renewed interest in other Treasuries as investors bought the issue at a better-than-expected yield of 6.060 percent. The number of bids exceeded the size of the issue by a ratio of 3.06 to 1, the best in years, though some of that could be attributed to the reduced size of the auction.</p>
        <p>The price of the closely watched 30-year bond rose 11/32 , to 10713/32 , while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.73 percent from 5.75 percent on Monday. The 10-year note, the emerging bellwether issue, rose 8/32 , to 1047/32 . Its yield fell to 5.91 percent from 5.95 percent.</p>
        <p>''The Labor Department's numbers couldn't have been any more friendly for bonds and stocks,'' said Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation in Boca Raton, Fla. ''But that doesn't mean bond prices will rise simply because the Fed is not expected to raise rates. We are still competing with abnormal rates of return in equities.''</p>
        <p>The productivity of the nation's workers increased at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the second quarter compared with a revised 1.9 percent in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>The government also said unit labor costs fell 0.1 percent.</p>
        <p>''The surge in nonfarm business productivity blew past even the most bullish forecasts on the Street,'' said Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisors.</p>
        <p>''One natural question that held back some of the excitement was simply that many investors appeared to wonder what could top this economic statistical release over the near term,'' he said. ''Given that the P.P.I. release on Friday did not appear to offer the same sort of positive surprise potential, many saw some justification for the surprising subdued response.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chan said there was no doubt that after last week's employment report, yesterday's productivity report only had the potential to shift the Fed toward raising rates but may have had the opposite effect.</p>
        <p>''One could argue that it calls into question whether any further action can be expected from the Fed,'' Mr. Chan said.</p>
        <p>Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of five-year notes, which was a reopening of the issue sold in May:</p>
        <p>(000 omitted in dollar figures)</p>
        <p>Price: 102.787  High Yield: 6.060%  Low Yield: 5.990%  Median Yield: 6.049%  Total applied for: $33,785,687  Accepted: $13,189,107  Noncompetitive: $532,092  Interest set at: 6 3/4</p>
        <p>The five-year notes mature May 15, 2005.</p>
        <p>THE MARKETS: BONDS  Correction:  August 10, 2000, Thursday  A picture caption yesterday with a front-page article about the process of choosing Al Gore's running mate misspelled the surname of Mr. Gore's foreign policy adviser. He is Leon Fuerth, not Furth.</p>
