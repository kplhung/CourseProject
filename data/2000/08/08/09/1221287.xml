        <p>Joe Torre said Monday that he was ''surprised'' by the waiver acquisition of the slugger Jose Canseco, a less than enthusiastic response that drew a subtle rebuff from George Steinbrenner.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Steinbrenner put out this statement: ''I want it made very clear that I support the decision of Brian Cashman 100 percent, and I'm very surprised by anyone who would be surprised by his aggressiveness. Jose Canseco has been a very big contributor.''</p>

        <p>If Steinbrenner intended this to be a shot at Torre, the manager said after last night's game: ''I can't help it. He's the boss. I respect the fact that he's the boss. He can pretty much do whatever he wants.''</p>
