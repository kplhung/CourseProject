        <p>The Hyundai Group, South Korea's largest conglomerate, reported record profits in its automotive business today, an unexpected piece of good news from a company known lately more for its heavy debts, drag on the national economy and defiance of pressure to change.</p>
        <p>The results at Hyundai's automaking subsidiaries, the Hyundai Motor Company and the Kia Motors Corporation, reflected a rebound in demand for new cars in South Korea and a record surge in exports, especially to North America. But Hyundai creditors immediately seized on the news to demand that the parent company hasten its promised restructuring and separate the auto business from Hyundai's unhealthy subsidiaries.</p>
        <p>Earnings at Hyundai Motor for the first six months of this year surged to 310.4 billion won, or $278 million, from 110.2 billion won a year earlier. Kia, which verged on collapse during South Korea's economic crisis a few years ago, earned 82.6 billion won, or $74 million, in the first half of this year, in contrast to a loss of 33.8 billion won a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Hyundai Motor said sales rose 40 percent, to 8.47 trillion won, or $7.5 billion. Sales at Kia rose 69 percent, to 4.8 trillion won, or about $4.3 billion.</p>
        <p>For Hyundai, it was clearly the best news since June, when DaimlerChrysler A.G. agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in Hyundai Motor with an option to buy 5 percent more over the next three years. That relationship is expected to make Hyundai a top global car brand.</p>
        <p>Since the DaimlerChrysler alliance, however, Hyundai Motor's parent company has been hurt by growing concern over a severe cash shortage at another important subsidiary, Hyundai Engineering and Construction. This has increased pressure from creditors who are demanding the separation of healthy affiliates from the Hyundai Group. The creditors are also seeking a far lower profile in the group's management affairs by Hyundai's founder, Chung Ju Yung, 85, and his sons Chung Mong Jun and Chung Mong Koo.</p>
        <p>The Hyundai Group's main creditor, Korea Exchange Bank, sent a letter to the conglomerate today demanding an acceptable restructuring plan by next Saturday. The conglomerate had proposed a restructuring plan over the weekend, but the creditor bank rejected it, saying the plan failed to satisfy concerns about the family's management roles.</p>
        <p>Although Hyundai Motor's strong results helped it to reduce some debts, total debts at the construction unit and the group as a whole are still high. Total debts at Hyundai Engineering and Construction stood at 5.1 trillion won, or nearly $4.6 billion, at the end of 1999, of which nearly half is due by the end of the year. Total debt at the conglomerate stood at 52.6 trillion won, or more than $47 billion, at the end of last year.</p>
        <p>Concern about Hyundai's debts has weighed on South Korea's stock market and has made investors wary about the true extent of the country's recovery from its 1997-98 economic crisis. Hyundai's problems were an important reason that President Kim Dae Jung shook up his cabinet on Monday, replacing the finance minister and other important economic officials.</p>
        <p>Creditors of Hyundai regard the founding family as a major impediment because family members have resisted efforts to make the company's finances more understandable.</p>
        <p>Chung Mong Koo, another son of the founder, still leads the carmaker. Although analysts say that Chung Mong Koo is one of the few people who know the full workings of the company and that he has a solid grasp of the terrain of the domestic auto industry, critics say he is intertwined in the group's complicated web of cross-debt guarantees.</p>
        <p>In an apparent contradiction of vows made to shareholders two months ago, when he announced he would relinquish his management control of the Hyundai Group, the conglomerate's founder recently raised his stake in Hyundai Motor.</p>
