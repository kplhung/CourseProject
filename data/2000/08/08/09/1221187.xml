        <p>IN legend and in fact, German wine terminology is practically indecipherable to Americans. Driven by precision but weighed down by bureaucracy, German wine labels nowadays convey information that is often contradictory and gives little hint as to what's actually in the bottle.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, certain clues can at least help you distinguish between dry and fruity wines. The terms ''halbtrocken'' and ''trocken'' indicate wines that are, respectively, dry and very dry.

        <p>IN legend and in fact, German wine terminology is practically indecipherable to Americans. Driven by precision but weighed down by bureaucracy, German wine labels nowadays convey information that is often contradictory and gives little hint as to what's actually in the bottle.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, certain clues can at least help you distinguish between dry and fruity wines. The terms ''halbtrocken'' and ''trocken'' indicate wines that are, respectively, dry and very dry. These wines may also include traditional terms like ''kabinett,'' ''spatlese'' and ''auslese,'' which indicate the amount of sugar that was in the grapes when they were harvested.</p>
        <p>In dry wines, these terms don't add much to the understanding, though in fruity wines they indicate a potential for sweetness, with kabinetts being the least sweet, spatleses next and then ausleses, which are often sweet enough to be dessert wines.</p>
        <p>Even so, you can still be fooled. A kabinett can taste sweeter than a spatlese if the sweetness is not offset by sufficient acidity. In German wines, balance is the most critical element.</p>
        <p>And keep in mind that some prominent producers, like Georg Breuer, have chosen to forgo any of this nomenclature, relying on customers' familiarity with their styles.</p>
        <p>Among the fruity wines, I gravitate toward kabinetts. They are light and lightly sweet, wonderful with food and low in alcohol, especially those from the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, which can be as low as 7.5 percent. They are especially good in the summer.</p>
        <p>Good dry German wines are harder to find but can be magnificent.</p>
        <p>In the end, the best bet for advice on which German wine to buy is finding a knowledgeable merchant. That, too, can be rare, but well worth the search.</p>
