        <p>Two years ago, Kirby Mack was selected to the All-Ivy League team as a fullback. Yet, as he approaches his final season with Columbia, Mack may never carry the ball again for the Lions.</p>
        <p>Instead, the 6-foot-2-inch, 235-pound player from St. Louis will be playing outside linebacker. He has been shifted to the defense in large measure because of the success of his cousin, Johnathan Reese, a junior, who was Columbia's leading rusher last season.</p>
        <p>Because Mack was sidelined for most of last season with a variety of leg injuries, the Columbia Coach Ray Tellier elected to go with a one-back offense: Reese. He responded by gaining 607 yards for a 3.8 average per carry.</p>
        <p>''Because of our new offense and Johnathan's ability, both as a runner and receiver, we decided to move Kirby to outside linebacker,'' Tellier said today at the annual Ivy League coaches media day at the Yale Golf Course. ''Kirby's excited about it, and being very agile and given his size, we're sure he'll do well based on what we saw in spring practice.''</p>
        <p>Tellier, starting his 12th season as the head coach, certainly hopes so. Columbia yielded an average of 30 points a game last season when the Lions went 3-7 (1-6 Ivy).</p>
        <p>''We should be much better on defense since we lost only one player on the defensive line and all of our linebackers, plus Kirby, are back,'' Tellier said. ''And both Avery Mosely and Philip Murray return at cornerback and free safety.''</p>
        <p>If Tellier is sanguine about his defense and running game, he is unsure of what to expect at quarterback. Jeff McCall, the junior who shared the position with the graduated Mike Glynn last season, is ''neck and neck,'' Tellier said, with the senior Mark Stoutenberg. Considering that neither one was consistent last season, that may bode well for Eric Moss, a 6-4 sophomore who played on the junior varsity team last year.</p>
        <p>A new offense is also about to be unveiled at Princeton by Roger Hughes, who was named the head coach in January to succeed Steve Tosches. Hughes had been the offensive coordinator at Dartmouth for eight years.</p>
        <p>Hughes steps in to an enviable position, since the Tigers have a host of experienced players returning after going 3-7 over all and 1-6 in the league. With two experienced quarterbacks in the junior Tommy Crenshaw, who is expected to be the starter again, and the senior Jon Blevins, Hughes will use a pro-style offense that will include multiple formations and the senior running back Kyle Brandt, who led the Tigers with 466 yards rushing and a 5.4-yard average despite spending four weeks as a defensive back.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that we have a lot of good players,'' said Hughes, who will have 13 starters returning from last season.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>A preseason poll by the news media projects Yale, which shared the Ivy title with Brown last year, and Cornell to finish atop the league, followed by Pennsylvania, Brown, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth and Columbia. Brown is precluded from being crowned champion, after the league ruled the Bears had given illegal financial aid to players. . . . With 116 players, Columbia will have its largest squad since the early 1970's. ''And the 28 seniors are the most that we've had since I've been here,'' Columbia Coach RAY TELLIER said. . . . Referring to his star quarterback of last season, Yale Coach JACK SIEDLECKI said, ''Life after JOE WALLAND will be interesting, but it will still go on.'' While Walland's successor has yet to be determined -- the junior PETER LEE is the leading candidate among a group of inexperienced quarterbacks -- Yale returns 15 starters, including the All-Ivy running back RASHAD BARTHOLOMEW, its three leading tacklers, all three linebackers, the school's career-leading place-kicker, MIKE MURAWCZYK, and its career interception leader, TODD TOMICH. ''Joe Walland was the greatest player I have ever coached,'' Siedlecki said of the departed signal caller who set a slew of Yale passing records last season and ran or passed on every play in the second half as Yale rallied to defeat Harvard in the waning seconds of The Game at the Yale Bowl.</p>
