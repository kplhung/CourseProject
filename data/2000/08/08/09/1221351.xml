        <p>LOCKWOOD - Henrietta Ellery Sedgwick from Bedford, New York, died August 4, 2000 in her 94th year. She was an honorable member of the New York Botanical Garden, vice-president of the Garden Conservancy and former vice-president of the New York Horticultural Society. She was also a founding member of the Rare Plant Group of the Garden Club of America. Gardening was her lifetime passion and her beautiful interesting garden was often open to benefit public organizations. Small but mighty she was a ceaseless inspiration to the many friends and family she leaves behind. She was predeceased by her husband, John E. Lockwood, whose career spanned from working with Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes to becoming senior partner of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy and legal counsel to John D. Rockefeller and his family. Both Mr. and Mrs. Lockwood were very involved with the school of American Ballet, of which Mr. Lockwood was chairman. Funeral services will be announced.</p>
