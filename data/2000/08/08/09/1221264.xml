        <p>A 40-year-old man on the housekeeping staff of a state-owned nursing home in Queens shot and killed his supervisor in her basement office yesterday, the police said.</p>
        <p>After shooting his supervisor, Elizabeth Parker, 58, of Flushing, Queens, in the head about 1:45 p.m., the man, Steven Robinson of Jamaica, Queens, fled on a blue and yellow mountain bike, wearing the light blue shirt and dark blue trousers of his nursing home uniform, the police said.</p>
        <p>Co-workers at the New York State Veterans Nursing Home, at 178-50 Linden Boulevard in the St. Albans section had overheard the two arguing earlier in the day, the police said.</p>
        <p>After the shooting, Mr. Robinson  apparently rode to his father's house in Jamaica, Queens, said Willie Robinson, his father. The elder Mr. Robinson said his son seemed agitated yesterday afternoon and admitted to having shot the woman. ''He said he just snapped,'' the father said. His son had worked at the home for about two years, adding that part of his son's frustration may have come from his inability to find a better job. ''He said she pushed him over the edge,'' the father said.</p>
        <p>The father, 71, a pastor at the St. John's Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in St. Albans, said his son had served two prison sentences for selling drugs but had no history of violence.</p>
        <p>The son was on parole, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Twice before, the pastor said, he had taken his son to the police when he was wanted on drug charges. This time, he said, he could not convince his son to turn himself in. After the conversation, the son left, and Mr. Robinson, who was later questioned by detectives, said he did not know where his son had gone.</p>
        <p>The nursing home referred all calls to John F. Signor, a spokesman for the State Department of Health, which both oversees and regulates the nursing home. Mr. Signor said he had no details about the shooting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Signor said the state does not have regulations or guidelines requiring background checks for nursing home employees who are not directly responsible for patient care. The Health Department will investigate if the nursing home followed its own policies, he said.</p>
        <p>Neighbors of Ms. Parker's said she was a friendly woman who left for work at 6 each morning. Luiz Lopez, the assistant superintendent in her apartment building, said Ms. Parker had lived there for 15 years. She was a widowed mother of three and was a grandmother, said her mother-in-law, Alberta Parker.</p>
