        <p>Now that the Andersens are finally splitsville, are accountants going to forsake everything but the single life, limiting themselves to poring over a company's books and offering tax advice?</p>
        <p>Not if they can help it.</p>
        <p>A day after an arbitrator freed Andersen Consulting from Arthur Andersen, the tax and auditing firm, attention shifted to some of the other accounting and consulting marriages that are on the rocks. Though the world's largest accounting firms are eager to sell their existing consulting businesses for a variety of reasons, they will probably continue to offer a wide array of services -- unless regulators place new limits on them.</p>
        <p>In the long run, ''all the public accounting firms will be in consulting,'' predicted Robert K. Elliott, the chairman of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and a partner with KPMG.</p>
        <p>Consulting has fueled much of the firms' growth over the last decade or so, said Jon McKenna, the executive editor of the Public Accounting Report. ''It would be foolish to sell off a goose that golden,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The international arbitrator brought in to settle the bitter Andersen dispute, which had dragged on for three years, essentially gave Andersen Consulting its freedom for a paltry $1 billion, although Arthur Andersen got the right to the Andersen name.</p>
        <p>But the other firms moving toward split-ups expect to get a lot more than $1 billion given the high valuations on the consulting businesses. Ernst &amp; Young sold its consulting unit earlier this year to Cap Gemini S.A. for some $11 billion, and KPMG plans to spin off the bulk of its consulting operations in an initial public offering that could raise nearly $3 billion. PricewaterhouseCoopers is also considering divesting itself of its consulting unit by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Selling at least a part of the business to another company or the public makes sense, according to Mr. Elliott. ''I think it's driven by the economics,'' he said. Some firms are worried about the retirement needs of their partners, while others simply want to put the cash to other uses, offering stock to the partners or investing more in the traditional accounting side of the firm.</p>
        <p>If money is why these firms are getting out, money may be the reason these firms get back into consulting, even after they sell off a large stake in their existing businesses. Arthur Andersen, for example, started another consulting business even after it decided to part ways with Andersen Consulting. ''There's a natural desire to have consulting in one of these firms,'' said Kenneth A. Merchant, the dean of accounting at the University of Southern California.</p>
        <p>What might change is the type of consulting these firms do. They may move away from management or information technology consulting to other areas that are either in demand or somehow related to their expertise in giving outsiders faith in the numbers and representations that companies make. ''The challenge is what does business assurance mean,'' said Rocco J. Maggiotto, the global leader of markets and strategy for PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>
        <p>There is also some anxiety among these firms that the Securities and Exchange Commission might eventually give them little choice in the matter. Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., has expressed concern over the perception that auditor independence has been hindered by consulting services offered by the same firm, a perception strengthened when companies like Pinnacle Holdings and its auditor come under investigation for questions of independence, as happened yesterday. While accounting firms are already prohibited from offering some of those services, the S.E.C. is proposing to bar companies from using the same firm to provide both internal and outside audits and using a firm that provides information services consulting to them as their auditor.</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Levitt does not prevail, or reaches a compromise that allows many of the consulting services to still be offered, the need to reassure investors and clients of their independence may force firms to stay away from certain businesses. ''Whether Levitt is there or not, they've opened the box up,'' said Tom Rodenhauser, an analyst with Consulting Information Services, who expects the relationship between accountants and consultants to fundamentally change to avoid potential conflicts of interest.</p>
        <p>After the firms rid themselves of their consulting units and become smaller, there is also the possibility of futher consolidation, even as the firms once known as the Big Eight have shrunk to the Big Five. Without the consulting unit, Arthur Andersen has become a much smaller player, and Ernst and KPMG had once expressed interest in combining.</p>
