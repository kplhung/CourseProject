        <p>The government's recent campaign to intimidate some of this nation's most powerful business leaders is meant at least in part to show them that President Vladimir V. Putin is firmly in control. But beneath the surface, executives say, it is business as usual in Russia.</p>
        <p>The intimidation campaign has included spectacular raids by masked federal agents on offices, surprise lawsuits asserting fraud and tax evasion, and public reprimands of the so-called oligarchs who have amassed enormous amounts of property and political influence since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Such moves were all but unheard of under Mr. Putin's predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>

        <p>The government's recent campaign to intimidate some of this nation's most powerful business leaders is meant at least in part to show them that President Vladimir V. Putin is firmly in control. But beneath the surface, executives say, it is business as usual in Russia.</p>
        <p>The intimidation campaign has included spectacular raids by masked federal agents on offices, surprise lawsuits asserting fraud and tax evasion, and public reprimands of the so-called oligarchs who have amassed enormous amounts of property and political influence since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Such moves were all but unheard of under Mr. Putin's predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
        <p>Still, business leaders, including some of the oligarchs themselves, say little has changed in the way their companies operate. Political connections, they say, are still the most important ingredient for success in Russia.</p>
        <p>''Our business strategy under the new administration hasn't really changed,'' said Mikhail M. Fridman, chairman of the Alfa Group, one of the country's most influential financial concerns. ''Russia is a country with a fairly opaque economy and to do business here you need sturdy political connections and relations. To deny this is just silly.''</p>
        <p>In some ways, the behavior of businesses here is rooted in a relationship with the government that evolved in czarist Russia centuries before the 1917 revolution. Russian businesses have long sought the blessing of government bureaucrats to get ahead. Personal relationships guided business dealings often more than laws. Company owners competed for the loyalties of corrupt local officials. The country's richest men helped Mr. Yeltsin win the presidency in 1996, and in return, they were given government posts and tremendous influence over policy.</p>
        <p>It was precisely these men Mr. Putin, during his presidential campaign, promised to push out of government.</p>
        <p>Indeed, criminal investigations were opened against the media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky, and executives at Russia's biggest oil company, carmaker and metals company. But over the last two weeks the law enforcement authorities have dropped most of those cases.</p>
        <p>The government also has ignored the high-profile armed standoff between two factions of directors vying for control of the Krystall vodka factory here in the capital.</p>
        <p>Some tycoons, like Roman Abramovich, a friend of the Yeltsin family who owns vast assets in Russia's oil and aluminum industries, have gone untouched by state investigations, raising concerns that some industry leaders are more equal than others.</p>
        <p>Some business executives fret that under Mr. Putin corrupt bureaucrats will be replaced with a new set loyal to him but no less hungry for personal advancement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's aides say the president has already taken decisive action to curb Russia's regional governors, some of whom are known to bully business, obstruct economic changes and block liquidations of money-losing factories that should be shut to save costs. The aides say society is stuck in old perceptions and definitions about how Russia is run.</p>
        <p>''We have left the epoch with the old set of cliches, clans and groups,'' said Vladislav Surkov, deputy head of the presidential administration. ''Now there's a wind of new power, and it's different.''</p>
        <p>But business leaders are still playing by the old rules. Mr. Fridman of the Alfa Group is a good example.</p>
        <p>With assets that range from gasoline stations and grocery stores to the country's biggest private bank, Alfa has risen to be one of the country's most influential business groups. It has extensive contacts in Mr. Putin's administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fridman said political connections were essential, but acknowledged that too many make a business beholden to government.</p>
        <p>''It's essential to have contacts with government on all levels regional and federal but we don't want to make it a priority,'' he said. ''Business sitting in the front-row seats always has to take the most criticism.''</p>
