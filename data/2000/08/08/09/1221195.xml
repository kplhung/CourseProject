        <p>In Pacific Coliseum sports stadium, the Iranian pop diva Googoosh was about to begin her second public performance in more than 20 years. Dressed in an elegant simple blue silk dress reminiscent of her days as a Tehran cabaret star, and encircled by replica pillars from the ancient Persian site of Persepolis, she paused reflectively.</p>
        <p>Before launching into ''Gharibeh Ashenah''  (''A Stranger, Familiar''), an old favorite from her 70's heyday, Googoosh, bathed in green, white and red light, the colors of the Iranian flag, proclaimed to the crowd, ''I wish that all Iranians could be here with me tonight.''</p>
        <p>Her words, which were met with a resounding cheer from the thousands in the sports stadium, were at once defiant and wistful; they expressed her wish that her fans in Iran could also hear her live performance. For Googoosh, along with all other Iranian women, has been banned from singing in public since the 1979 revolution.</p>
        <p>In Iran, Googoosh, 50, is not merely a pop star. She is a singer whose fame and post-revolutionary exile from the public eye have turned her into a national icon. When, later in the program, she sang the song ''Captive Land'' from her new CD, ''Zartosht'' (which she recently recorded in Toronto after the music was recorded in Tehran), the allusions to imprisonment, pain and heartbreak could have referred to her own life story as well as the plight of her countrymen.</p>
        <p>For Googoosh's life -- which has traversed harassment by the family of the Shah and 20 years of isolation in post-revolutionary Iran -- has become for many Iranians a metaphor of their own.</p>
        <p>But, auspiciously perhaps, and in a possible sign of the power of reformist currents in Iran, Googoosh was recently given permission to travel abroad. In the last few years the Iranian authorities have softened their hard-line stance on pop music. While the sale of pop music cassettes and CDs is still illegal, possession is now allowed. In addition, some male pop singers have been permitted to perform in public under certain circumstances. While it is unclear whether President Mohammad Khatami himself gave the green light for her public performances abroad, there were no conditions attached to her departure. On July 29 Googoosh began a world tour that will include dates in North America, Europe and the Middle East. She is scheduled to appear in Los Angeles on Aug. 19 and at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., on Aug. 26.</p>
        <p>Googoosh's husband, the filmmaker Massoud Kimiai, is accompanying her, and with a brother in Toronto and a grown son and grandchild in Los Angeles, there is much speculation among Iranians that she may eventually settle in North America.</p>
        <p>Despite recent reformist tendencies, it is still not known how the singer, whose full name is Faegheh Atashin, would be received if she does return to Iran. Already her world tour has been condemned by outraged fundamentalists. And Mr. Kimiai was recently summoned to appear in an Iranian court to defend the morality of one of his films.</p>
        <p>But for her thousands of expatriate Iranian fans, hearing Googoosh live after two decades of silence is a dream come true. Her fame has often been compared to that of Elvis Presley in the West.</p>
        <p>Lyrically and musically her work is complex. She has worked with the best arrangers and poets in Iran.</p>
        <p>Her songs are a blend of East and West, rooted in serpentine Persian melodies but often backed up by danceable bass lines and electric guitars and, more recently, propelled by Gipsy Kings-style rumbas. At the same time one senses in Googoosh's haunting alto the influence of the French chanson, with her gift for deeply emotional and compelling interpretation.</p>
        <p>With the post-revolutionary ban on public singing by women -- the authorities contend that women's voices could corrupt men -- she went from being a pop diva with her own palace, to singing only occasionally for small groups of women in private. But her impact on the Iranian public continued.</p>
        <p>Her voice and image have been kept alive by a huge fan base inside and outside of Iran. There are several Web sites in Farsi and English that offer video clips from her films and television appearances.</p>
        <p>In Googoosh's appearance here in Vancouver, after an inaugural one in Toronto, her fans were ecstatic.</p>
        <p>''After all this time, she's only gotten better,'' said Mehrdad Hashemi, 33, one of some 50,000 Iranians in Vancouver and one of the 10,000 at the concert. ''We say she is like a carpet from Kerman. The older and more worn down it gets, the more valuable it becomes. She is precious to us now.''</p>
        <p>''She has suffered, but she has triumphed,'' said Tahareh Zahrah, a 42-year-old mother of two who last saw Googoosh perform in 1977. ''Googoosh was my idol so this is a real thrill. Growing up, we all used to imitate her -- what she wore, how she acted. She used to change her hairstyle and her look as often as Madonna. We just loved her.''</p>
        <p>Zahrah's friend Nahid Yusefi said that to this day her presence was still palpable in Iran. ''When I went back home in 1995, you could hear her old songs everywhere, in taxis, in the parks, even in public buildings, you could hear the melodies,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Asked what Googoosh meant to him, Zahra's 21-year-old son, Omid, who was born just after the revolution and grew up in Canada, said, ''She represents the real spirit of what was the true country called Iran.'' One factor in Googoosh's continued cult status is veneration by a generation of young people who were not even born when she last performed in public.</p>
        <p>Some left-wing critics of the Iranian government living abroad object to her tour, arguing that it helps present a softer, false picture of Iranian rule. And for fundamentalist elements inside and outside Iran, she is still considered decadent. Opposition to the tour has also been expressed by some Iranian pop singers in Los Angeles who, after 20 years of struggling to make it in what they refer to as Tehrangeles, are at least temporarily being upstaged by a star from the past.</p>
        <p>But Rahmin Mahjouri, editor of Payvand, a leading Farsi weekly in Vancouver, said that he believed making artists into political apologists was unfair. ''Googoosh is simply doing what she loves best -- performing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>This was certainly not overlooked by fans in Vancouver, who seemed to cheer the loudest when she sang from her new CD, ''Why is it these days that singing is a crime?''</p>
