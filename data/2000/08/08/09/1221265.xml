        <p>When the United States Olympic trials begin here Wednesday, swimmers will make as much news for what they are wearing as for what records they may set in qualifying for the Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>A bodysuit, including a long-sleeved design that fits athletes from neck to ankle, has revolutionized the sport by reducing drag as swimmers slice through the water. Since the bodysuits were approved for international competition at the beginning of the year, almost all of the world's top swimmers have started wearing them.</p>
        <p>And the flurry of records recently set by two bodysuit wearers -- Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands and Ian Thorpe of Australia -- put other swimmers on notice that the suits provide an edge. Most of the 1,306 competitors here at the Olympic trials are expected to wear some version of the suits, as are a great majority of the medal hopefuls in Sydney.</p>
        <p>The new suits are said to increase speed by up to 3 percent, which can make the difference between a gold medal and fourth place in a sport in which races are decided by hundredths of a second.</p>
        <p>Most of the top American swimmers have welcomed the suit as an inevitable advance in technology that has brought the hinged blade to speedskating, aerodynamic bikes to cycling, the flexibility of fiberglass to the pole vault and graphite rackets to tennis.</p>
        <p>Marion Jones, the track and field star who is hoping to win five gold medals at the Summer Games, may also use a new track suit design to gain an edge in her sprint races. She has been experimenting with a hooded, full-length bodysuit to counter the effects of the wind and cool temperatures expected in Sydney.</p>
        <p>The most widely used model of the bodysuit here is made by Speedo, the official supplier of the United States team. It is called the Fastskin suit, which mimics sharkskin in that it contains tiny V-shaped ridges that allow water to pass over the swimmer more efficiently. The superstretch fabric also compresses a swimmer's muscles, reducing vibration in the tissue and therefore reducing the buildup of lactic acid that causes fatigue.</p>
        <p>Swimmers also say the suit keeps them higher in the water and helps them retain speed and form when they begin to tire. There are five versions of the bodysuit available. Some swimmers prefer suits that only cover their torsos, some men prefer only trunks that extend to their thighs or ankles, and some male and female swimmers are wearing the neck-to-ankle version without sleeves.</p>
        <p>''I feel like it's a power suit when I put it on; I feel like a superhero a little,'' said Tom Malchow, who set a world record in the 200-meter butterfly in June in a bodysuit. ''I was hoping they would put a Superman or Batman logo on the front.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone approves of the suit. Aleksandr Popov of Russia is the most well-known swimmer who does not wear a bodysuit. He shattered the world record in the 50-meter freestyle in June and said he would continue to wear the same briefs that brought him two gold medals in the sprints at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Gary Hall Jr., who finished second twice to Popov in Atlanta, agreed with his rival.</p>
        <p>''It's a gimmick,'' Hall said. ''It's an attempt by the swimsuit manufacturers to make everyone believe that the suit makes the swimmer, not that the swimmer makes the suit.''</p>
        <p>Opposition comes on three fronts. One, swimming's world governing body, known as FINA, has approved the use of the suit even though its bylaws prohibit any device that enhances an athlete's ''speed, buoyancy or endurance'' in competition. John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee, has accused FINA of misinterpreting its own rules in allowing the bodysuits, which clearly aid in speed and lift in the water.</p>
        <p>Two, not every athlete has had equal access to the suits or has been able to have one custom-fitted. The American swimming federation initially banned the suits from the trials, saying they would be unfair because not every athlete could get them. The federation quickly backed down last month when a swimsuit manufacturer filed a grievance with the United States Olympic Committee. Every swimmer at the trials who wants a bodysuit is supposed to be able to have one provided free (Speedo expects the full-length, long-sleeve suit to retail for $250 this fall).</p>
        <p>It was clear today, however, that some swimmers were experimenting with the suits for the first time with the trials only a day away.</p>
        <p>''If people haven't worn them before coming here, it could be dizzying trying to figure out which style to wear,'' said John Collins, who coaches the renowned Badger Swim Club in Larchmont, N.Y.</p>
        <p>But the cat is out of the technological bag, so to speak, and any swimmer who does not wear one in Sydney risks being left behind in the chase for medals. The new suits are hardly the first innovation in swimwear. Body-hugging Lycra suits appeared in the mid-1970's, and more than 75 percent of the medalists at the 1996 Atlanta Games wore a version of the Speedo Aquablade model, sleeveless suits that covered women from neck to knee and men from waist to knee.</p>
        <p>Of the approximately 100 suits that another sportswear company, Nike, has given away here, 95 have been a version of the bodysuit, said Carrie Bates, a sports marketing manager for Nike and an Olympic champion swimmer in 1984.</p>
        <p>''You'll never stop the evolution of technology,'' said Bates, who won three gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. She disagreed with Hall's assessment that the suits were a gimmick. ''This is about helping the swimmers find what they are most comfortable and confident with,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A number of swimmers have complained that the national swimming federation's vacillation has caused confusion and interrupted training with the suits. But most swimmers seem pleased to have a chance to compete in the suits before the Olympic Games, where they will be prevalent.</p>
        <p>''I'm pleased with the decision,'' said Jenny Thompson, who has won five Olympic gold medals in relays. ''We should be practicing what's going to be the norm in Sydney.''</p>
        <p>Amy Van Dyken, who became the only American woman to win four swim gold medals in one Olympics, at the Atlanta Games, pointed out that she won the 50 freestyle and the 100 butterfly by a combined total of four-hundredths of a second.</p>
        <p>''It's not going to turn a swimmer like my mom into an Olympic gold medalist,'' Van Dyken said. ''But in hundredths of a second, it could make a difference.''</p>
        <p>Lenny Krayzelburg, a world record-holder in the 100 and 200 backstrokes, said he would wear a version of the Fastskin suit that extended from his waist to his knees because he sensed a loss of feel for the water in the suits that covered his entire legs, chest and arms. Some breaststrokers said they felt constrained by the suits when they perform their outward-kicking stroke.</p>
        <p>''It's like putting on pantyhose, but 10 times worse,'' said Kristy Kowal, a favorite in the 100 and 200 breaststrokes.</p>
        <p>Still, most elite swimmers will squeeze themselves into some form of the bodysuit here and in Sydney. Some are already anticipating the next advancements for the 2004 Games in Athens.</p>
        <p>''In a couple of years, I don't know if they're going to have gills built into the suits, but that would be kind of cool,'' Van Dyken said.</p>
