        <p>A Movable Feast Of a Wedding</p>
        <p>So a lot of the wedding guests went on the honeymoon, too.</p>
        <p>Last week, PIA LINDSTROM, a daughter of Ingrid Bergman who is a film and theater critic on television, married JACK CARLEY, a lawyer. The wedding was on the terrace of her half-sister ISABELLA ROSSELLINI's apartment on the Upper East Side -- ''We had 15 minutes when it wasn't raining,'' Ms. Lindstrom said yesterday. Then she and her husband headed for the house they have just bought in the Hamptons, trailed by relatives: ''The Rossellinis, the Lindstroms, the Carleys, my two sons.''</p>
        <p>''I had about 12 people staying here,'' Ms. Lindstrom said yesterday. She said that Mr. Carley had done some barbecuing -- ''very exciting for city people.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Carley, a lawyer and senior vice president at the Cendant Corporation and a law school classmate of JUDGE VICTOR MARRERO of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who officiated at the wedding, repeated something he had said at the ceremony: ''If Ronald Reagan had not been elected president, I would not have met Pia Lindstrom.'' Mr. Carley was general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget in the 1980's. The deputy director was JOSEPH WRIGHT, whose wife, ELLEN, later introduced Mr. Carley to Ms. Lindstrom, who now appears on ''Good Day New York'' on WYNW-TV.</p>
        <p>'Tonight Show' Lands Mrs. Clinton</p>
        <p>HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON is expanding her presence on the late-night talk show circuit. The Democratic candidate for Senate has agreed to appear on ''The Tonight Show'' with JAY LENO on Friday night, her advisers said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The taping will come after she arrives in Los Angeles to accompany PRESIDENT CLINTON to the Democratic National Convention.</p>
        <p>After much cajoling, Mrs. Clinton appeared on ''Late Night With David Letterman'' in January.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's advisers had been divided over the wisdom of that move, but by most accounts, Mrs. Clinton fared well in her appearance with Mr. Letterman. Thus, there was little debate about whether she should take advantage of a slot on the Leno show.</p>
        <p>Blowing Kisses, Stopping Traffic</p>
        <p>There were things that ANNA NICOLE SMITH, the former jeans model, would not say yesterday -- her dress size, for example, or her weight, which has fluctuated over the years. And there were things that she could not say -- her appearance beneath a Times Square billboard was cut short by police officers who, she said, ordered her entourage to move on. (The officers were concerned that a traffic-blocking crowd had gathered around the sport utility vehicle in which she had arrived, she said.)</p>
        <p>By the way, she liked the billboard. ''I'm in la-la land,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Presumably, that is a more pleasant place than court, where she has also been lately. The feud over the estate of her second husband, J. Howard Marshall II, a Texas oilman who died in 1995 at 90 and left an estate estimated to be worth more than $1 billion, continues. She is fighting her late husband's stepson for a part of the estate; she has said that her husband promised her half.</p>
        <p>But back to the scene beneath the billboard, at 46th Street and Broadway.</p>
        <p>The traffic stopped, she said. ''I was blowing kisses out the window. I felt bad because I wanted to get out and say 'hi' to my fans.''</p>
        <p>Weather Frightful, Victory Delightful</p>
        <p>W. RANDALL JONES, the chief executive of Worth Media, managed to stay upright despite the not inconsiderable swells that the yacht Lady Windridge was slicing through the other night after leaving the North Cove Yacht Harbor at Battery Park City.</p>
        <p>Some of his 300 guests played it safe, reclining on sofas, while others ignored the elements and discoed their way through a two-hour cocktail and dinner cruise.</p>
        <p>The guests were supposed to watch Worth's seventh annual President's Cup Regatta, but the weather kept them from seeing very much of it. And after scarcely placing in a number of those years, the J24 sailboat sponsored by the magazine had won. Mr. Jones was jubilant. So were KEN YELLOTT, the captain of the victorious craft, and his rain-soaked crew of four. Their Champagne victory toast and silver cup were accompanied by a wristwatch for each of them: a $25,000 watch presented by Parmigiani Fleurier, the Swiss watchmaker to which $25,000 is a next-to-basic price range.</p>
        <p>The guests, an assortment of socialities, corporate types and advertising representatives, included the novelist BARBARA TAYLOR BRADFORD and her husband, ROBERT; ANNE SLATER and her trademark blue-tinted glasses; and JOHN LORING, the design director of Tiffany's. They went home with a Parmigiani token of their own: a silver money clip.</p>
        <p>It came in handy for SYDNEY NEGLEY, who is studying singing at Point Park Conservatory in Pittsburgh and has been working as a summer waitress at Guastavino's, Terence Conran's restaurant in the Bridgemarket complex under the Queensboro Bridge. She recently shared a $300 cash tip with a colleague. But Ms. Negley said that her favorite dispenser of largess was an elderly woman who, after her husband had added a gratuity to their charge, pressed a $5 bill into her hand and said, ''This is just for you -- manners count!''</p>
