        <p>Coach Jim Fassel has backed off his threat to make immediate changes on the Giants' special teams, perhaps because it would require dipping into the thin first and second teams.</p>
        <p>Today, Fassel, who was disturbed by the play of the coverage teams in last Saturday's preseason loss to the Chicago Bears, said, ''My message to those guys is someone is going to make the team purely on their special team ability and someone is going to get the shock of their lives because they can't do anything on special teams.''</p>

        <p>Coach Jim Fassel has backed off his threat to make immediate changes on the Giants' special teams, perhaps because it would require dipping into the thin first and second teams.</p>
        <p>Today, Fassel, who was disturbed by the play of the coverage teams in last Saturday's preseason loss to the Chicago Bears, said, ''My message to those guys is someone is going to make the team purely on their special team ability and someone is going to get the shock of their lives because they can't do anything on special teams.''</p>
        <p>Fassel said that inexperience and lack of speed were the main reasons for the coverage unit's failure against the Bears. The Giants allowed one kickoff return for 65 yards and a punt return for 50 yards in the 20-8 loss at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>''How do you not improve on the other night?'' fullback Greg Comella, who also played on special teams, said today as he missed a second straight day of practice because of back tightness.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Fassel went so far as to say, ''If I get a repeat performance like that, I will fire some guys.'' Today, he tempered his words, but he promised to look at other players on the roster.</p>
        <p>Fassel said that this morning's scheduled special teams practice featured an increased intensity among the players. For his part, Fassel took a more active role in the workout, standing at the center of the field and barking critiques ''because I'm not a happy camper with those guys.''</p>
        <p>Larry MacDuff, the special teams coach since Fassel became head coach in 1997, used the word ''ugly'' to describe how the unit has looked through its on-the-job training.</p>
        <p>''It's not fun,'' the animated coach said. ''I hate it. I hate the results.''</p>
        <p>MacDuff spends most of practice running downfield, following the ball and screaming commands like a crazed fan yelling at his television. By watching film of Saturday's game, MacDuff noted the young players experienced ''tunnel vision'' as they focused strictly on the ball and not on their routes.</p>
        <p>''We were seeing things for the first time and weren't sure what to do,'' MacDuff said.</p>
        <p>Despite his disappointment with Saturday's game, MacDuff did not criticize any individuals. He said he was impressed with the kick returners Ron Dixon, a rookie, and Kevin Prentiss, a second-year player, and with Emmanuel McDaniel on the kick return coverage team.</p>
        <p>Fassel, too, has been quick to defend the special teams under his command, saying they are not a continual problem. Statistics show otherwise. Last season, the Giants ranked 23rd in the 31-team league defending punt returns and 17th on kickoffs. In 1998, they were 21st on punt returns and 22nd on kick returns and in 1997, 16th on punt returns and 24th on kick returns.</p>
        <p>This year the Giants' special teams have been depleted by injuries. Bashir Levingston, a National Football League Europe All-Star for special teams this off-season, is recovering from ankle surgery. The promising rookie Dhani Jones tore a ligament in his left knee in a special teams drill last month and will miss the season. Dave Thomas, a free agent from Jacksonville who was expected to play a significant role on coverage teams, will instead start at cornerback because Conrad Hamilton was cut.</p>
        <p>Special teams lack the glamour of other units, and some players see the job as a bridge to a more important role. For some rookies, it may be their only chance to make the team.</p>
        <p>Linebacker Jessie Armstead was one of the Giants' top special teams players in his first two seasons, 1993 and 1994. But he wasn't ready to volunteer today when he was light-heartedly asked to return to the unit.</p>
        <p>''I'm too old,'' the 29-year-old Armstead said. ''I can't help them.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Arthroscopic surgery on tight end PETE MITCHELL on Tuesday did not reveal any further damage to his sprained left knee and Coach JIM FASSEL said Mitchell could return after the Sept. 3 season opener against the Arizona Cardinals. Mitchell, who was injured in Saturday's preseason game, has no torn ligaments but has one stretched ligament, which Fassel said was ''as good news as we can have.'' The anterior cruciate ligament, the most important ligament in the knee, is sound, Fassel said. . . . Wide receiver JOE JUREVICIUS (bruised right shoulder) watched Tuesday's practice with his right arm in a sling, but Fassel said he could practice Wednesday and play Friday night at Jacksonville. . . . DAN CAMPBELL, the top pass-catching tight end until Mitchell returns, missed his second day of practice because of a hamstring strain. . . . Linebacker MIKE BARROW (sprained knee) and free safety SHAUN WILLIAMS (sprained toe) again missed practice.</p>
