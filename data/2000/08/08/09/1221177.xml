        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The West Sees One Mugabe, but Africa Sees Another'' (Week in Review, Aug. 6): AIDS is the biggest problem facing Zimbabwe, not land equality. Through his policy of land appropriation, President Robert Mugabe threatens to worsen the AIDS epidemic in his country.</p>
        <p>The only way Africa will recover from the AIDS plague is through international cooperation. Africa needs more than medical and technological aid; it needs foreign investment.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mugabe's reforms sabotage any hopes that Zimbabwe has of attracting foreign money. No company will sink capital into a country with a reputation for stealing its citizens' assets. Though land redistribution is an important issue, Zimbabwe can ill afford to pursue it at the cost of isolating itself from foreign investment.</p>
