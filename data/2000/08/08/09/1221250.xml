      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Now that the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island is getting out of the garbage business, borough officials are coming up with ideas about how to use the land. The first idea on their list? Building highways, streets and bridges atop the 2,200-acre landfill.</p>
        <p>Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island borough president, asked yesterday for proposals from traffic consultants to draw up plans for a new network of roadways atop Fresh Kills, which is to close as a landfill in January. The new roadways would make use of the 18 miles of roads that already wind through the landfill for the use of trash trucks.</p>

        <p>Now that the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island is getting out of the garbage business, borough officials are coming up with ideas about how to use the land. The first idea on their list? Building highways, streets and bridges atop the 2,200-acre landfill.</p>
        <p>Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island borough president, asked yesterday for proposals from traffic consultants to draw up plans for a new network of roadways atop Fresh Kills, which is to close as a landfill in January. The new roadways would make use of the 18 miles of roads that already wind through the landfill for the use of trash trucks.</p>
        <p>The new public roads would help to alleviate traffic tie-ups, which are worsening on Staten Island, said Jennifer M. Nelson, a spokeswoman for the borough president. The congestion is especially bad in the middle of the island around the West Shore Expressway and the commercial strip along Richmond Avenue, where Fresh Kills is situated, she said.</p>
        <p>The cost of the roads and highway bridges is estimated to be $130 million, she said. The roadway plans have been endorsed by City Sanitation Department officials.</p>
        <p>But the plans may well disappoint the city parks officials and professors who envisioned idyllic parkland on an area four times the size of Central Park, including, for instance, oak forests and wildflower-covered meadowlands that would attract a vast variety of wildlife, as well as golf courses and tennis courts.</p>
        <p>Staten Island, which has 413,280 residents, is now the fastest-growing borough in New York City.</p>
        <p>In addition to new roads, Staten Island officials are considering building baseball and soccer fields on the landfill when it is vacated. Open land for ball fields is so scarce on the island that children's teams often must be driven to New Jersey, Brooklyn or Manhattan. There has also been talk of creating a small wildlife refuge, on trash-covered land that has long attracted a variety of birds and other wild creatures.</p>
        <p>The Sanitation Department must monitor Fresh Kills for 30 years after it closes, checking for dangerous emissions, before it will be considered safe enough to build houses there for continuous habitation.</p>
