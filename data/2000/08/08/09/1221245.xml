        <p>The gesture spoke volumes about Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's longtime friendship with President Clinton.</p>
        <p>One June afternoon in 1999, three months after the Senate voted to acquit an impeached President Clinton, Ella Freilich, Senator Lieberman's mother-in-law, opened a formal-looking envelope at her home in Riverdale in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>It was from the White House, an invitation to a state dinner in honor of the president of Hungary, Arpad Goncz. To Mrs. Freilich, a Holocaust survivor from Hungary, the invitation, and the evening, was not one she would soon forget.</p>
        <p>If there was any doubt that President Clinton harbored no ill will toward Mr. Lieberman for his sharp, public rebuke of Mr. Clinton and his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, the state dinner put it to rest, friends, colleagues and former aides to Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>''Inviting Senator Lieberman could have been a political act,'' said Michael Lewan, the former chief of staff for Mr. Lieberman. ''Inviting the mother was a generous act.''</p>
        <p>Throughout more than two decades, Senator Lieberman and President Clinton have shared the kind of friendship that is unique to two people who meet early in their careers, decide boldly to challenge the rules and then actually succeed.</p>
        <p>In their case, the common goal was to corral a wayward Democratic Party and bring it back to the political center, something they both started working on in the 1980's as members and then chairmen of the Democratic Leadership Council.</p>
        <p>The two became particularly close when Mr. Clinton was chairman of the council in 1990.</p>
        <p>''A decade ago, there were only a few political leaders in America who thought this transformation was possible, and Bill Clinton, Joe Lieberman and Al Gore were in on it from the beginning,'' said Bruce Reed, Mr. Clinton's domestic policy adviser. ''And that forged a bond that is much larger than any issue of the moment.''</p>
        <p>Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, called Mr.  Lieberman and Mr. Clinton ''political soulmates from Day 1.''</p>
        <p>''They were partners in the reshaping of the Democratic Party,'' Mr. From said.</p>
        <p>Senator Lieberman first met the president when he hired Mr. Clinton, a 24-year-old Yale law student, as a campaign aide in his run for the Connecticut State Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has said he remembers the campaign aide.</p>
        <p>Years later, their paths crossed  when Mr. Clinton, the governor of Arkansas, and Mr. Lieberman, a recently elected United States senator, formed an alliance with like-minded Democrats at the Democratic Leadership Council. At times, the push to change the party was not an easy one, but the effort helped forge long-lasting ties among the members.</p>
        <p>From that period on, Senator Lieberman and Mr. Clinton weathered their share of turbulent moments; more often than not, Mr. Lieberman displayed the sort of loyalty that Mr. Clinton did not forget.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Clinton suffered an embarrassing defeat in the Connecticut primary, he did not blame Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Lieberman continued to campaign forcefully for him.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Clinton was elected, Mr. Lieberman was sometimes invited to munch popcorn and watch a movie at the White House. He often served as a sounding board for the president on issues of foreign policy.</p>
        <p>After the 1994 health care plan debacle, which cost Democrats the House, Mr. Lieberman was one of the people Mr. Clinton telephoned to discuss what had gone wrong.</p>
        <p>The speech Mr. Lieberman delivered on the Senate floor remains one of the senator's most painful episodes, friends and aides say. But when he decided that Mr. Clinton's behavior, while immoral, was not grounds for removal from office, he worked behind the scenes to try to persuade Republicans to vote for a censure proposal instead of conviction on the impeachment charges.</p>
        <p>After the speech, Mr. Clinton said Senator Lieberman was right to criticize him, and Mr. Clinton apologized for his behavior.</p>
        <p>Last week, the two talked on the telephone, and on Monday Mr. Clinton called his old friend again, this time to congratulate him on his place on the Democratic ticket.</p>
        <p>''He's an extraordinary, extraordinary human being as well as a longtime friend of mine,'' Mr. Clinton said after the announcement.</p>
