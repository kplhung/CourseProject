        <p>This is not a place that immediately leaps to mind when people think of tourism destinations.</p>
        <p>But when 40 travel agents showed up here tonight for the beginning of a two-day tour of Newark's neighborhoods, parks and partly revitalized downtown, they got an intriguing glimpse of something that probably could not have happened at another time in the last four decades: the selling of Newark.</p>
        <p>The gathering, known in the tourism business as ''a mystery tour'' in which the visiting agents are given only a general idea of what they will be seeing, is the first time in the memory of city officials and local tourism experts that the city has so aggressively sought its share of an estimated $7.5 billion annual tourist market in northern New Jersey.</p>
        <p>It was an effort that would not have been possible until now in a city whose image has long been defined by the devastating riots of 1967.</p>
        <p>Indeed, along with a recent advertising campaign organized by a consortium of business and civic groups to promote the city to corporations looking for office space, the tour was part of Newark's efforts to capitalize on a thriving economy and a pervasive sense of opportunity.</p>
        <p>''The idea that we are the capital of bad inner cities is gone,'' said Councilwoman Gayle Chaneyfield-Jenkins, a member of the City Council's newly energized tourism committee, which is co-sponsoring the tour with the Gateway Tourism Council and the New Jersey chapter of the American Society of Travel Agents.</p>
        <p>''The view here is that we are one of the great cities -- not the prettiest, because we have our warts, but not the ugliest either,'' she said. ''It's like a house that is being remodeled but isn't quite there. But it's good enough to invite guests in.''</p>
        <p>Mark Shapiro, the president of the New Jersey chapter of the travel agents group, said that at first the idea of Newark was ''a tough sell'' to a busload of savvy travel agents.</p>
        <p>''Their first reaction,'' he said, ''was 'Are you out of your mind?' But now they are very excited.''</p>
        <p>Today's tour comes on the heels of the advertising campaign unveiled this summer by corporate leaders. It began with a six-week print campaign featuring full-page testimonials from new and longtime business leaders in the city telling of advantages like the transportation network, nearby airport, fiber optics infrastructure and office rents that are a fraction of the Manhattan rents just a 15-minute train ride away.</p>
        <p>Dan Gales, executive director of Connection-Newark, the private economic development group that helped organize the campaign, said that the goal was to demonstrate that changes in Newark were real and not just public relations hype.</p>
        <p>To that end, the campaign stresses things that are already completed in the city and plays down such things as a proposed downtown sports arena for the New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils, the construction that just began on the regional headquarters of the credit-card giant M.B.N.A., and the newly opened Starbucks.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to demonstrate that Newark is more than just the promise of future activity or things that we think will happen,'' said William Freeman, the president for public communications of Verizon and one of the business leaders behind the ad campaign. ''We want to show businesses and others thinking about locating here that they aren't pioneers and that the pioneering has already been done.''</p>
        <p>The group is still assessing the impact of the print ad campaign, which ended in late June, as it prepares to run a similar ad campaign on television. A Web site set up for businesses interested in Newark received 30,000 to 40,000 hits a week during the campaign, which ran from May 28 to July 5. It featured ads in The Star Ledger, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and local ethnic papers. Before the ads ran, the site received about 5,000 hits a week.</p>
        <p>As they began their tour this evening at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, many of the travel agents did sound a bit like wary pioneers while others with memories of a long-ago Newark were just glad that someone was giving them a reason to think about returning.</p>
        <p>''I live an hour away but never came to Newark because, frankly, there wasn't much reason,'' said Ralph Ferrara of Schneider Travel Service in Butler, N.J. ''I'm very anxious now to see why I should come here.''</p>
        <p>After a reception tonight at the Newark Museum, the tour will take many of the travel agents tomorrow to Branch Brook Park, a sprawling area designed by Frederick Law Olmstead that has more cherry blossoms than Washington's Tidal Basin. They will visit the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, rebuilt residential areas like Society Hill in the Central Ward where the 1967 riots began, and stalwart older communities like Forest Heights with its hardy Victorian houses. They will visit the home of the New Jersey Historical Society and tour the minor-league baseball park Riverfront Stadium and one of the newly renovated downtown office buildings that is attracting lawyers and high-tech businesses.</p>
        <p>For Claudette Jones of Voyager Travel in Trenton, the tour was ''a great, great opportunity'' to sample the improvements in the city that she has heard about. For Salvatore Castoria, of A Better Trip in Matawan, N.J., the ''bad outweighed the good in Newark'' for a long time, but the tour gave him a chance to learn a lot of positive things about the city.</p>
        <p>''You're not going to go here instead of Miami Beach,'' Aland Landesman said, ''but for a day or two while visiting the region it's fine.''</p>
        <p>Richard Copland, the incoming president of the American Society of Travel Agents, who runs Hillside Travel in the Bronx, was impressed mostly by the $187 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which he said was among the attractions that could help Newark attract some of the ''spillover'' tourism from New York, which is bursting at the seams with tourists.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of money out there now, and people who travel want options like a baseball game, entertainment, restaurants,'' Mr. Copland said. ''Five years ago you wouldn't come here and would be talking instead about the poverty and drug addiction of Newark. But that has changed, and I'm impressed.''</p>
        <p>But some Newark travel agents, like Lorraine Lavender of Grand Travel Inc., were less convinced of the city's appeal. Many of the amenities that tourists seek were not here in abundance, she said, adding that greater economic development and the influx of more businesses was necessary before the city could be a true tourist destination.</p>
        <p>''When 6 o'clock comes, they are like cattle leaving,'' she said, referring to people who work in many of the city's office buildings.</p>
        <p>But Kevin Jenkins, the husband of Councilwoman Chaneyfield-Jenkins, said there was ample recent history of urban turnarounds to give him confidence that Newark's efforts to sell itself to business as well as tourism had a shot at success.</p>
        <p>''They said it was wishful thinking in Cleveland, in Baltimore and Boston,'' he said. ''Look at those places. Who's dreaming?''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 11, 2000, Friday  An article on Wednesday about Newark's efforts to increase tourism by giving a two-day tour of the city's neighborhoods to 40 travel agents misstated the name of the older neighborhood of Victorian houses they visited. It is Forest Hill, not Forest Heights.</p>
