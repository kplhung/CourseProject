        <p>Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, left the team Monday during a game against the Seattle Mariners and might be out for at least 10 more days as part of his treatment schedule for bone marrow cancer.</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre told club officials in March that he was likely to leave the team for an extensive period during the season. Last week he informed the Yankees that he would have to go through some procedures early this week.</p>
        <p>Among the procedures are tests that could lead to what is called a stem cell transplant, in which cells are taken from the body, cleansed and reintroduced into the system.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, confirmed after last night's game that Stottlemyre will miss the coming road trip. ''This is nothing that wasn't expected,'' said Torre, who told his players about the Stottlemyre's situation before last night's game.</p>
        <p>Billy Connors, a Yankees vice president who has worked with almost every member of the major league pitching staff, will fill in for Stottlemyre. Connors declined to comment about that role yesterday, and Stottlemyre, who told reporters in April that he would not speak about his illness during the season, was not at the Stadium.</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre has been undergoing chemotherapy treatments during the season and has gone about his work with a business-as-usual manner.</p>
        <p>''He's a pillar of strength,'' David Cone said. ''He's more worried about us. He's more worried about trying to get me going. That's the truly amazing part: how selfless he's been and how much he still enjoys being around the team.''</p>
        <p>Andy Pettitte, the Yankees left-hander, said: ''He's our pitching coach. He's the guy you talk to when you're having problems. He's definitely missed when he's not around, that's for sure.''</p>
        <p>Cone, who has known Stottlemyre and Connors for years, said that Connors is  ''more of a technician.''</p>
        <p>''Mel does that very well, also, but Mel's more of a strategist, reading tendencies, going over different approaches,'' Cone said. ''Billy is a presence with mechanics. We also have the benefit of Tony Cloninger, who's a good pitching coach, as well. We're very well covered.''</p>
        <p>Contract Ball Is Rolling</p>
        <p>The Yankees have begun discussions on a contract extension for the relief pitcher Jeff Nelson, just one of a series of talks the Yankees are likely to engage in before the end of the season.</p>
        <p>Nelson has been one of the most effective setup men in baseball, and he is eligible for free agency after this year. Nelson said in early July that he would not approach the Yankees again about opening talks on an extension, that he would wait for them to come to him. And that is apparently what has happened.</p>
        <p>Among the other contract talks the Yankees will address soon includes right fielder Paul O'Neill, who is eligible for free agency after this season, but, at age 37, is having a strong season.</p>
        <p>Joe Bick, O'Neill's agent, said the player ''absolutely'' wants to stay.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are already involved in talks with pitcher Denny Neagle. The discussions will probably result in something like a four-year deal for about $9 million a season.</p>
        <p>And the Yankees have an understanding with pitcher Roger Clemens on a two-year deal worth $14 million to $15 million a year. At some point in the next few months, they are expected to conclude the paperwork.</p>
        <p>A seven-year, $118.5 million agreement with shortstop Derek Jeter fell apart when George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, would not give his final approval. Now a new contract will have to be negotiated, with Jeter -- like the reliever Mariano Rivera -- eligible for free agency after this year.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are very likely to try to sign catcher Jorge Posada to a multiyear deal.</p>
        <p>''If they were to come up with something, I would take a look at it,'' Posada said.</p>
        <p>Rehabilitation for Knoblauch</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch, placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strain in his right elbow, will leave the team tomorrow and go to Tampa, Fla., to continue his rehabilitation.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch had a dye test on his elbow Monday, and according to the Yankees, the test only confirmed that there is inflammation.</p>
