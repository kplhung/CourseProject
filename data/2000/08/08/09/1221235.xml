        <p>Iran's last major reformist newspaper was closed by the hard-line judiciary today, two days after the country's supreme leader intervened to block legislation aimed at restoring a free press.</p>
        <p>Outside Parliament, hundreds of hard-liners demonstrated for a second day, demanding the expulsion of pro-reform deputies who objected to the action by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's top religious leader who has final say in state issues.</p>
        <p>The paper, Bahar, a popular daily, one of 23 publications shut since April, was ordered closed for ''disturbing public opinion.'' Its publisher, Saeed Pourazizi, a close aide to President Mohammad Khatami, a reformist, was charged with printing ''a fake interview at a sensitive time.''</p>
        <p>Bahar (the name means spring) had lasted less than three months. It appeared after a crackdown on independent newspapers that had helped reformist candidates win the parliamentary elections in February. Reformist politicians promised voters that the new Parliament would overturn the restrictive press and social laws enacted by its predecessor.</p>
        <p>But on Sunday, Ayatollah Khamenei denounced the proposed revision in the press law as a threat to national security and religion. Parliament had to drop the bill.</p>
        <p>Reformists, stunned at the ayatollah's last-minute intervention, held emergency meetings.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Bahar published an interview with Ahamad Pournejati, a member of Parliament, who said the reformers would seek a way to pursue the bill. A hard-line newspaper, Keyan, asserted that Bahar had faked the interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pournejati, a leader of the move to revise the press law, resigned today as chairman of Parliament's Commission for Culture, to protest the attacks on the reformers. ''The reason behind the commission's attempt was nothing except fulfilling its lawful and legitimate duty toward honorable people who are the major owners of this system,'' he told Parliament.</p>
        <p>He resigned hours before Bahar was closed and as supporters of Ayatollah Khamenei demonstrated outside Parliament. Dressed in white funeral shrouds, to show their willingness to die, the protesters carried banners that backed the supreme leader and criticized reformist lawmakers.</p>
        <p>''I am ready to become martyr,'' they chanted. ''The Parliament is no place for traitors.''</p>
        <p>The current press law allows the courts, which hard-liners dominate, to close newspapers at will. This week, a provincial journal, Cheshmeh Ardebil, was shut, and Ahamd Zeidabadi, a journalist with a reformist newspaper, was arrested. A publisher and two journalists were also summoned to court today.</p>
        <p>But reformers pledge to carry on their campaign. Other lawmakers expressed dismay at being barred from voting on the press bill, but they also said they were confident that some progress might yet be achieved.</p>
        <p>Elaheh Koulai, a reformist deputy, said: ''The bill is not dead yet. We can change the parts that the leader is concerned with in a way that people and the Parliament would be satisfied, as well.''</p>
        <p>But the speaker of Parliament, Mehdi Karoubi, a veteran revolutionary recently turned reformer, insisted today that Parliament consider the press bill ''over.''</p>
        <p>''It is our duty to obey the leader's order,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The independent press has been an important vehicle for the reform movement since President Khatami's election three years ago. Publishers have started papers as old ones were shut. Eight new publishing licenses have been issued by the pro-reform Ministry for Culture and Islamic Guidance.</p>
        <p>''We will legally press for reform in rational ways,'' said Mr. Pourazizi, the publisher who despite the closing of his paper expressed hope. ''Reform is not a hasty movement. We must be persistent and patient.''</p>
