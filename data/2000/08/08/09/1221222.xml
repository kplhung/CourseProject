        <p>Diageo P.L.C. of Britain has held preliminary talks with Bacardi Ltd. and several others about forming a joint venture to make a bid valued at more than $7 billion for the spirits business of the Seagram Company, executives close to the discussions said today.</p>
        <p>The preliminary talks are part of the jockeying among several potential buyers for position to bid for the business when it is put up for sale as part of the acquisition of Seagram's entertainment businesses by Vivendi, the French utility conglomerate. Vivendi is planning to use the proceeds of a sale to reduce its $6.6 billion in debts.</p>

        <p>Diageo P.L.C. of Britain has held preliminary talks with Bacardi Ltd. and several others about forming a joint venture to make a bid valued at more than $7 billion for the spirits business of the Seagram Company, executives close to the discussions said today.</p>
        <p>The preliminary talks are part of the jockeying among several potential buyers for position to bid for the business when it is put up for sale as part of the acquisition of Seagram's entertainment businesses by Vivendi, the French utility conglomerate. Vivendi is planning to use the proceeds of a sale to reduce its $6.6 billion in debts.</p>
        <p>Although Seagram's spirits division, which includes such premier brands as Chivas Regal scotch and Martell cognac, is not expected to be formally up for auction until early September, Diageo and Bacardi have begun to explore whether a joint bid would make practical sense, the executives said.</p>
        <p>Diageo has also made contact with Pernod Richard S.A. about a similar arrangement, though the executives said a joint effort by Diageo and Bacardi seemed more likely.</p>
        <p>Diageo, which just sold its Pillsbury division and plans to spin off its Burger King fast-food restaurants to focus on its liquor business and Guinness beer holdings, is eager to acquire at least part of Seagram's spirits business to strengthen its stable of liquor brands. Diageo is also motivated by the competitive threat of Allied Domecq P.L.C., which is eyeing Seagram's spirits business, too.</p>
        <p>Diageo is hoping to join forces with another company, the executives said, to avert possible antitrust concerns about owning an unfairly large segment of the liquor business. Diageo and Bacardi would be able to divide Seagram's brands between them in ways that could satisfy regulatory objections.</p>
        <p>Diageo and Bacardi have done deals together before: Diageo sold its Dewar's scotch brand and Bombay gin to Bacardi. Because Bacardi is so small, it needs to join with a company like Diageo to put together a competitive bid.</p>
        <p>Charles Bronfman, the co-chairman of the Seagram Company, is also considering making a bid for his company's spirits division, according to people close to the talks. Claridge Investments Ltd., Mr. Bronfman's privately held investment group, has retained investment bankers at Bear Stearns to examine a possible bid. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is handling the auction of Seagram's spirits business.</p>
