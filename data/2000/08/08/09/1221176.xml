        <p>Whole fish cooked on the bone is moister than a fillet, and the bones do enhance the flavor. But most people who order a whole fish in a restaurant ask the waiter to bone it. Too often, the fish comes back after some minutes, almost cold. It is quicker to do the job yourself, and easier than you might think. Cut a long slit the length of the fish about half an inch from the top, or dorsal, edge. Make another slit perpendicular to the first just before the head, and a third at the tail. You can then lift off the top fillet, and after that lift off the head and bones. And there you have it, ready to eat.</p>
        <p>At Molyvos in Midtown, the waiters ask customers whether they want to do the boning themselves when the order is placed. If so, the chef, Jim Botsacos, makes it easy for them, cutting the slits in the kitchen. Who bones their own fish? ''Mainly the Greeks,'' he said. ''Not the Americans.''</p>
