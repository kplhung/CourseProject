        <p>Twenty-eight states, including New York and Connecticut, filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan yesterday against major record distributors and record-store chains , accusing them of a conspiracy to fix prices of compact discs.</p>
        <p>The suit named the distributors Sony Music Entertainment, Capitol Records, Universal Music Group, Warner-Elektra-Atlantic and BMG Music, and the retailers Tower Records; Musicland Stores Corporation, which operates the Sam Goody and Musicland chains; and Trans World Entertainment Corporation, whose outlets include Record Town and Camelot Music.</p>
        <p>Under a settlement reached with the Federal Trade Commission in May, the distributors agreed to cease  practices that the commission said had restricted discount CD marketing by chains including Wal-Mart, Kmart and Circuit City. The retailers were not involved in the F.T.C. case.</p>
        <p>But the settlement did not involve financial penalties, and the states' lawsuit intends to recoup the excess costs that consumers have paid for compact discs since 1995, said Eliot L. Spitzer, New York's attorney general.</p>
        <p>In settling the F.T.C. case, the distributors admitted no wrongdoing.  The federal agency had estimated that consumers were overcharged $480 million.</p>
        <p>Pam Horovitz, president of the National Association of Recording Merchandisers, an industry group whose members include the defendants, criticized the suit yesterday.</p>
        <p>''I don't think competition was harmed because I have seen no substantiation from the F.T.C. as to where they got their $480 million worth of overcharging,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer said the states had not yet decided how much to seek in damages, but suggested that the amount would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>According to the lawsuit, the defendants conspired to reduce the discounting of CD prices by discount chain stores, which began selling CD's in volume in the early 1990's and rapidly gained market share at the expense of record-store chains. One record-store chain estimated that the average price of a CD dropped from $15 to $10 in those years, the suit says.</p>
        <p>The suit says the record stores pressured the distributors to impose marketing agreements on the discount chains that prevented them from advertising CD discounts below set prices. Violations would lead to losses of the subsidies that the distributors regularly pay to retailers to advertise and promote recordings.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately, the financial pain  that the conspirators inflicted through such enforcement efforts resulted in unwilling agreements by discount retailers to adhere to agreed-upon price levels,'' the lawsuit charges.</p>
