        <p>The selection of her husband as Vice President Al Gore's running mate thrust Hadassah Lieberman onto the national stage today and into the type of highly public role she has worked hard to avoid as a political spouse.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lieberman, 52, has held several part-time jobs in Washington since her husband, Joseph I. Lieberman, was elected to the United States Senate in 1988. But her friends and former colleagues say her first commitment has always been rearing their daughter, Hana, who is 12.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lieberman, the former Hadassah Freilich, worked for the National Research Council promoting education programs and for APCO, a public relations firm. She has also done freelance public relations and health care consulting.</p>
        <p>In general, Mrs. Lieberman has preferred to work quietly for charitable causes rather than to promote any political agenda actively.</p>
        <p>At the rally introducing Mr. Lieberman in Nashville, Mr. Gore's wife, Tipper, spoke of Mrs. Lieberman today as the daughter of Nazi concentration-camp survivors, something that friends say is at the core of how Mrs. Lieberman views herself and the world.</p>
        <p>''I think her background as a survivor's daughter has given her a humanity that a lot of people don't have,'' said Mindy Weisel, a friend.</p>
        <p>For example, Mrs. Lieberman is on the board of the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation, which is building a visitors' center near the concentration camp in Poland and has supported the American Committee for Shaare-Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>The Liebermans, who were married in 1983, may seem to have a 1950's style of life, preferring quiet dinners at home to the buzz of the political social scene, but their family is a decidedly modern American one, extended exponentially by divorce and re-marriage even as it has remained rooted in traditional Jewish observance across four generations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's first marriage to Betty Haas, a psychiatrist, ended in divorce in 1981. They have two children, a son, Matt, 32, who teaches English in New Haven, and a daughter, Rebecca, 31, who lives in New York City and works for the Children's Aid Society. Matt and his wife, April, have two daughters, Willie, 1, and Tennessee, 3, whose name provided fodder for Al Gore at today's rally in Nashville.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lieberman is also divorced, from Gordon Tucker, a rabbi in White Plains, who is a former dean of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. They have a son, Ethan, who is now studying to become a rabbi.</p>
        <p>Besides the children, grandchildren and ex-spouses, Mr. Lieberman's mother, Marcia, still lives in Stamford, where he grew up, and Mrs. Lieberman's mother, Ella Freilich, a Holocaust survivor, lives in Riverdale, the Bronx, where she watched her daughter on television this afternoon.</p>
        <p>''I haven't slept in two days already, just answering congratulations,'' Mrs. Freilich said. ''I haven't eaten today. I am just sitting and crying.''</p>
