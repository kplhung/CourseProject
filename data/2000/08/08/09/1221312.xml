        <p>The Mets will get better on Wednesday, when Darryl Hamilton comes off the disabled list and Mike Piazza, perhaps, returns to the lineup after missing three days with a sprained knee.</p>
        <p>The team that had surged through the last two weeks did not show up at Enron Field tonight. Piazza and Edgardo Alfonzo sat out with minor injuries. A misfiring Al Leiter replaced the dominant one that the Mets have known. Even Mike Bordick, the sure-handed shortstop, made an error.</p>
        <p>The result was a 9-3 loss to the Houston Astros, who got seven strong innings from starter Brian Powell. Pitching just his second major league game in two years, Powell outpitched Leiter, who allowed five runs and six hits in five innings, his shortest start of the year. The Mets lost for the third time in 14 games.</p>
        <p>The Astros took an 8-1 lead by scoring three runs in a ghastly sixth inning by Pat Mahomes, who threw 39 pitches in allowing two hits, three walks and a wild pitch. Soon after, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine removed several starters.</p>
        <p>One of them, third baseman Robin Ventura, left the game for Matt Franco. After the game, Franco left the team to make room for Hamilton, another left-handed hitter, who has been out since April 7 with an injured left big toe.</p>
        <p>Franco singled in the eighth, improving his average to .231. But Franco hit .263 for the Mets over the last three years, and his average is well below his standards. He is not a starter, but for most of the year he has been Valentine's first option off the bench against right-handed pitchers. He set a major league record last year with 20 walks as a pinch-hitter.</p>
        <p>Franco was designated for assignment, meaning the Mets have 7 to 10 days to release him, trade him or outright him to Class AAA Norfolk. In his fifth year as a Met, Franco is a popular teammate, and the Mets were not quite sure what to hope for. He is out of options, meaning he would have to clear waivers to go to the minors; General Manager Steve Phillips said Franco will not be released.</p>
        <p>''Matty's done a lot for us,'' said catcher Todd Pratt, who considers Franco his best friend on the team. ''It's just hard. I'm hoping somebody picks him up. It'd be nice if they don't and he comes back up in September, but I kind of hope he gets an opportunity to play more somewhere.''</p>
        <p>Before the game, Phillips told Franco what would happen, and Franco was not surprised; the only Mets reserves with options are Pratt and Joe McEwing, whose versatility is essential to the team. Despite his numbers -- he was batting .195 as a pinch-hitter -- Franco has maintained all year that he is swinging better than ever.</p>
        <p>''I've never been more confident in myself or my abilities,'' Franco said. ''There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that I'm a major league player, and I fully believe I'll stay in the big leagues. The way this team is set up, I'm the odd man out, and I totally understand that.''</p>
        <p>If tonight was Franco's last game as a Met, it was not a memorable one. Leiter, especially, would like to forget it. The best the left-hander could say was that he avoided being struck in the face by a line drive in the fifth inning. The last batter Leiter faced, Moises Alou, sent a screamer back up the middle that Leiter snared, just in time. He said it was the closest call he has had on a line-drive comebacker in 12 years.</p>
        <p>''It's pretty scary, because your total reaction time is less than a half a second, and all you're trying to do is protect your head,'' Leiter said.</p>
        <p>Leiter (12-5) got into trouble immediately tonight. Julio Lugo hit a routine grounder to short leading off the bottom of the first, but Mike Bordick's high throw pulled Todd Zeile off first base. Zeile caught the ball and tried to swipe a tag, but Lugo was safe and Bordick was charged with his first error as a Met, in his 10th game with the team.</p>
        <p>Leiter then walked Lance Berkman, and Jeff Bagwell grounded a single to left, scoring Lugo with Houston's first run. A double and a run-scoring groundout gave the Astros a 3-0 lead. In the third, Powell's 350-foot fly ball scraped the nearby left-field wall and went for a double, setting up another run.</p>
        <p>''I felt great warming up, and it's exciting, because you anticipate something really great,'' Leiter said. ''The end of the first inning, we're down, 3-0. You feel like, 'Oh my God, I felt so much better than that.' ''</p>
        <p>Franco, who will return to New York to work out on his own as he awaits his destination, has been saying that to himself all year.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Catcher MIKE PIAZZA took batting practice and caught a bullpen session Tuesday, showing a full range of motion that led Manager BOBBY VALENTINE to say that he could be back in the lineup Wednesday, ''if he feels all right when he gets here.'' . . . Second baseman EDGARDO ALFONZO, who told Valentine he could have played Tuesday after straining his groin on Monday, is also expected to be back. . . . Valentine acknowledged he does not know how he will work DARRYL HAMILTON into the Mets' lineup, considering all three starting outfielders are playing well. But, Valentine said: ''If he does well, then we'll have four outfielders doing well. A little rest this time of year doesn't hurt anybody.''</p>
