        <p>The Joyce Theater will open its 2000-1 season on Sept. 26 with Rennie Harris Pure Movement, a Philadelphia-based company that will present a hip-hop opera called ''Rome and Jules'' based on Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet.'' The theater's resident company, Ballet Tech, will close the season on Aug. 18, 2001. Thirty-three companies will perform, and 75 premieres are scheduled.</p>
        <p>The Merce Cunningham Dance Company will return to the Joyce on Nov. 7 with a week of ''events,'' 90-minute collages of excerpts from old, new and current dances. There will also be an open rehearsal with Mr. Cunningham presiding.</p>
        <p>''That was Merce's idea,'' Linda Shelton, executive director of the Joyce, said in a recent interview. ''It's great to see the company in a small setting, and I think he likes performing here. He sells well, and our audiences enjoy it.'' The Cunningham company, which took over part of the season canceled by the Martha Graham Dance Company when it disbanded, will also appear in March at City Center.</p>
        <p>Foreign troupes new to the Joyce include P.P.S.-Danse from Canada (Oct. 3-8) in ''Bagne,'' which is French for penal colony. The evening-long duet, danced alternately by male and female casts, takes place in a jail cell. Compagnie Joseph Nadj, a staple of European dance, will perform in late April in its American debut.</p>
        <p>Two other novelties will be the Diavolo Dance Theater from Los Angeles in early January and the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet in late May. Ms. Shelton said she heard about Diavolo from other dance presenters. Directed by Jacques Heim, the troupe is made up of actors, gymnasts and dancers who perform on surrealistic structures.</p>
        <p>One of the hottest advance tickets is the Dayton Contemporary Dance Theater (Oct. 10-15), which will present a premiere by Ronald K. Brown and Donald McKayle. Michael Moschen in Motion (Nov. 14-26) will fill the rest of the canceled Graham engagement.</p>
        <p>The fall season will also include performances by the Stephen Petronio Dance Company (Oct. 17-22); Garth Fagan Dance (Oct. 24-Nov. 5); the Sydney Dance Company from Australia (Nov. 28-Dec. 3); and Ballet Hispanico (Dec. 5-17).</p>
        <p>Ballet Tech will perform Dec. 19-31; Altogether Different (Armitage Gone! Dance, ChameckiLerner, Compagnie Flak, Irene Hultiman's Allstars, the John Jasperse Company, Mark Dendy Dance and Theater and Wally Cardona Quartet) Jan. 10-28; and Momix Jan. 30 to Feb. 18.</p>
