        <p>New York City's credit rating was upgraded yesterday by Moody's Investors Service to its highest level in nine years, a change that officials estimated could save the city several million dollars.</p>
        <p>The rating was raised to A2 from A3 . That rating is still lower than that of 9 of the nation's 11 other largest cities, Moody's said. But it stands in stark contrast to ratings from 25 years ago, when New York City was in such poor shape that it could not borrow money on its own.</p>
        <p>Moody's analysis credited the city's booming economy and solid financial management for the upgrade. The city just ended its fourth fiscal year with a record budget surplus. In the most recent year, which ended on June 30, the city had an estimated surplus of $3.2 billion.</p>
        <p>''It reflects our view that the city is now better able to weather a downturn in the economy while maintaining a budget balance,'' Robert A. Kurtter, a public finance analyst for Moody's, said of the upgrade.</p>
        <p>New York City still has a relatively large amount of outstanding debt, forcing it to spend a big chunk of its annual tax revenue on those bills. And some fiscal monitors have warned that the city could face large budget deficits as soon as 2002.</p>
        <p>But the Moody's report noted that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani moved last month to curtail spending in the current fiscal year, 2001, and to limit a previously announced tax cut plan to try to ensure balanced budgets without major trauma.</p>
        <p>The intricate system of rating bonds helps determine how much interest the city must pay on money it borrows to build schools, roads, courthouses and other projects, because investors are willing to accept lower interest payments from governments that are considered financially healthy. Moody's last upgraded the rating in February 1998.</p>
        <p>''It is an affirmation and positive report on the progress we have been making,'' said Adam L. Barsky, director of Mr. Giuliani's Office of Management and Budget.</p>
        <p>The city does not plan to issue new bonds until late this year, when it will probably seek to borrow about $550 million, Mr. Barsky said, adding to $26.2 billion in outstanding general obligation bonds. The city is asking the other two major bond-rating agencies for an upgrade. Mr. Barsky estimated the city's savings at millions of dollars per year.</p>
