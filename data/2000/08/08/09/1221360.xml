        <p>TRUMP-Mary. Throughout the triumphs and tragedies of the Trumps, Mary Trump remained a pillar of strength, dignity and class. Although I am nothing more than a humble plumber, Mrs. Trump honored me by joining me for numerous lunches in the city with Donald, Maryanne, Elizabeth, Jim, Aurora and my Mom attending many of them. Her wit, her charm and her many risque jokes are memories I will cherish for a lifetime. My heartfelt condolences go to the entire Trump family. Lawrence Roman</p>

Trump, and beloved mother of Maryanne, Elizabeth, Donald, Robert and the late Fred, Jr. Her life of selfless dedication to her family and friends will keep her memory immortal. Though our words can do little to comfort you, we hope our thoughts and prayers will help support you at this time.</p>

Remember that all your mother's best qualities live on in each of you-yours to treasure and share through all the years to come. With heartfelt sympathy from the staff of Apartment Management Associates, Inc.</p>
