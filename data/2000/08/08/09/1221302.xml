        <p>The Bridgestone Corporation said yesterday that it would hold a news conference today in Washington, after a meeting of company representatives and regulators who have been investigating safety complaints and dozens of fatal accidents involving sport utility vehicle and pickup truck tires.</p>
        <p>Reuters and The Associated Press reported yesterday that the company's Firestone division would announce a recall of millions of the tires used by several automakers on S.U.V.'s and light trucks. The tire models listed in the reports were the ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT.</p>
        <p>Representatives of Firestone and Ford Motor met yesterday with officials of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to discuss its investigation of the tires.</p>
        <p>Most of the complaints involved the Ford Explorer, an agency official said. Martin Inglis, Ford's vice president for North American automotive operations, said his company had ''had a team working for 10 or 11 days around the clock'' to identify the extent of the problem.</p>
        <p>Firestone has been the main tire supplier to Ford since the days of both companies' founders, Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone.</p>
        <p>Ford has repeatedly said during the last week that it would continue to use tires made by Firestone. Discount Tire, Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck have stopped selling the tires because of safety concerns.</p>
        <p>Ken Fields, a spokesman for Bridgestone, based in Tokyo, said it would announce today ''additional steps that we are going to take to address this issue.'' The company declined to comment on the reports  of a recall. Its shares fell sharply in early trading in Japan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Inglis noted that unlike warranties on other auto parts, those on tires are issued by tire makers, and recalls are the responsibility of the tire maker, not the automaker.</p>
        <p>Scott F. Merlis, an analyst with Wasserstein Perella Securities, said the tire defects were primarily a customer relations problem for Firestone, which he said ''had to move fast to contain broader damage to the company's overall brand.''</p>
        <p>Consumer lawsuits have been filed since 1996 contending that the tires contributed to fatal accidents when the tires came apart -- especially during hot weather in the South.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the safety agency, which is part of the Transportation Department, said the government had not drawn any conclusions about the safety of the tires.</p>
