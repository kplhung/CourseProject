        <p>BellSouth in Atlanta and SBC Communications in San Antonio, have begun a review for a joint venture of the merged North American wireless operations of the two companies, a deal which is still under regulatory review.</p>
        <p>Larry Solomon, a spokesman for SBC, confirmed a report of the review that appeared in Advertising Age this week.</p>
        <p>He said that a list of 8 to 10 agencies was being created. It includes GSD&amp;M in Austin, Tex., part of the Omnicom Group, the agency that handles wireless advertising for SBC, and West Wayne in Atlanta, the agency that handles wireless advertising for BellSouth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Solomon said that the list would be narrowed to four agencies, before a final decision, which is expected in mid-October. Billings were not disclosed, but Advertising Age estimated them at $170 million to $250 million.</p>
