        <p>A bomb exploded in a pedestrian underpass at Pushkin Square in the center of Moscow at the height of rush hour this evening, killing 8 people, wounding 11 and sending dozens more fleeing smoke and flames that scorched the large underground plaza.</p>
        <p>Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov tonight described the explosion, which took place a year after rebel leaders in Chechnya began their latest uprising, as a ''terrorist act'' with a ''Chechen trace.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Luzhkov appealed to Muscovites to redouble their vigilance after a weekend in which the city had declared a state of emergency to guard against terrorist attacks threatened by rebel leaders in Chechnya on the anniversary of their uprising.</p>
        <p>No organization claimed responsibility for setting the bomb. The Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, firmly rejected Mr. Luzhkov's speculations. Mr. Maskhadov, in a statement delivered to Agence France-Presse in Ingushetia, the Russian republic west of Chechnya, said that ''neither the regular Chechen forces, nor special services, nor the warlords have anything to do with the explosion on Pushkin Square.''</p>
        <p>But before nightfall, a banner appeared in the crowd ringing Pushkin Square saying, ''The only good Chechen is a dead Chechen.''</p>
        <p>Like the unsolved car bombs and apartment building explosions in Moscow and other cities that killed nearly 300 Russians last September, the explosion today was sure to inflame political tensions over the war in Chechnya, either galvanizing those who support Russia's tough military campaign in the northern Caucusus or bolstering the conviction of those opposed to the conflict that there is no military solution.</p>
        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin reportedly met with senior ministers and ordered an investigation into the blast. Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. agent, spoke in a telegram of condolences to families of victims. ''This explosion deeply shocks all of Russia,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Less than an hour after the explosion, a second bomb was found on the edge of the square near an Armenian food store. It was destroyed by bomb-squad technicians.</p>
        <p>Pushkin Square is in some ways the emotional heart of Moscow, dedicated to Russia's most beloved poet and a popular meeting place flanked on one side by a large movie theater where an international film festival took place last month. The square -- the site of Russia's largest McDonald's -- is at the intersection of two main boulevards, and three subway stops, and bustles with pedestrian traffic. Striking there in the early evening rush hour is akin to placing a bomb at, say, Herald Square in New York. Dozens of kiosks line the passageway where the bomb exploded.</p>
        <p>Standing shirtless near one of the underground complex's exits, Alexei I. Molchanov, 23, a meteorology student from St. Petersburg, said he had just walked up the stairs when the explosion went off. ''If I had been walking a little slower, I would have been down there,'' he said. ''This is the kind of thing that makes you believe in God.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Molchanov said he had used his shirt as a tourniquet on the leg of a 50-year-old woman with a deep gash in her leg. ''I told her to stay quiet as I used my shirt to stop the blood,'' he said. ''But she was in shock. Her face was badly burned and she kept saying she wanted me to call her office and inform them what happened.''</p>
        <p>Olga Initskaya, 49, who had come to the square to meet a date, said she was standing at a kiosk at one end of the tunnel when she heard a bang and the lights went out. ''The shock wave knocked me down and I saw such terrible smoke coming down the passageway along with the injured,'' she said. ''They were all in shock.''</p>
        <p>Stunned victims, some of them streaming blood from shrapnel or glass wounds, others limping with shredded clothing and serious burns, stumbled up the exit stairs. Four of the exits from the passageway were enveloped by the acrid black smoke from small fires that erupted. For nearly an hour, Russian medics worked on the most seriously injured, one of them a young girl whose head and arms were covered with third-degree burns and who was bleeding profusely from her wounds.</p>
        <p>Short of stretchers, medics used blankets to carry some victims to rescue vehicles. In the shadow of the statue of Aleksandr S. Pushkin, the paving stones were trampled with bloody footprints and littered with bandages and torn clothing where victims were loaded into ambulances. A woman's shoe lay abandoned in a circle of blood.</p>
        <p>Russian television said the Federal Security Service had determined that the blast was caused by a bomb in a satchel placed near an underground kiosk. Late tonight, Russian news agencies were quoting Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo and Federal Security Service officials as saying they had the description of two suspects in the blast, both men in their late 20's.</p>
        <p>In a news conference, Mayor Luzhkov, who twice visited the scene of the blast, said the police were working from eyewitness accounts that two men stopped at one of the underground kiosks to buy something. They attempted to pay with dollars, the mayor said, but when the clerk demanded Russian currency, they hurried away saying they were going to a currency exchange and left a satchel behind. The explosion occurred seconds later, the mayor added.</p>
        <p>''The testimony from several witnesses who were able to answer questions in the hospital'' indicated that the bombing had a ''Chechen trace,'' the mayor said. ''It was 100 percent Chechnya.''</p>
        <p>Interior Ministry troops in flak jackets barricaded the square and the main thoroughfares that intersect there for much of the evening. Several of the men who provide security for the underground plaza sat on park benches, their clothes stained by blast debris.</p>
        <p>Most of the injured were taken to Sklifasovsky Hospital, where medical officials put out an appeal for blood donors to come tonight.</p>
        <p>This summer's security alert went out after Chechen rebel commanders vowed to take their campaign beyond the borders of their breakaway republic. Authorities reported seizing large batches of weapons and explosives in Moscow and Ryazan in recent weeks, and warned municipal leaders to increase security.</p>
        <p>At a news conference this evening, Mayor Luzhkov urged city residents to step up communal watch patrols as they did in the high state of alert last fall.</p>
        <p>Last Aug. 31, in the first of a series of bombings, one person was killed and 20 injured when a bomb ripped through one corridor of the underground shopping mall just outside the Kremlin. Five days later, a car bomb in Dagestan killed 64 people, mostly families of Russian military officers. But on Sept. 9 and 13, Muscovites were stunned and outraged by explosions that demolished apartment blocks, killing 94 in the first blast and 118 in the second. A final blast killed 17 people in Volgodonsk in southern Russia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin, who had just been appointed prime minister, blamed Chechen rebels for the bombings, and launched a military campaign that has been notable for its destruction of civilian targets, including much of the Chechen capital, Grozny. But he has defended it as an ''anti-terrorist'' operation.</p>
