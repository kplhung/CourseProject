        <p>SPIVACK-Gordon B., 71, of New Haven, CT, world-renowned antitrust attorney, died on Sunday, August 6, 2000. Mr. Spivack was born in New Haven on June 15, 1929, son of Jacob and Sophie Spivack. From 1986 until the time of his death, Mr. Spivack was a Senior Partner at Coudert Brothers, an international law firm in New York. Mr. Spivack attended Yale College from 1946-1950. He then served in the U.S. Army from 1950-1951. In 1952 he returned to Yale University to obtain a law degree graduating magna cum laude. Mr. Spivack began his career at the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice on the Honor Program under the then Attorney General, Herbert Brownell, and quickly rose to the top career position as Chief of Field Operations where he supervised 350 trial attorneys. In 1967 he left the Justice Department to teach Antitrust Law and Civil Procedure at Yale Law School, where he remained until 1970. In 1970 Mr. Spivack joined the Lord, Day &amp; Lord law firm as senior partner to establish an antitrust practice which grew to twenty lawyers plus support staff. When Mr. Spivack decided to leave the firm to join Coudert Brothers in 1986, the full complement of attorneys involved in antitrust matters elected to go with him.
