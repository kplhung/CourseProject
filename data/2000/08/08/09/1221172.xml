      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>At the new branch of La Maison du Chocolat in Rockefeller Center, they don't call the confection at left a candy bar. But how else do you define a large portion of chocolate filled with white coconut? At the store, 30 Rockefeller Plaza (on 49th Street), this curiously American style treat reveals its Parisian roots. Called a bouchee, it is made of superb bittersweet chocolate filled with fresh coconut, which is embedded in a white chocolate and vanilla ganache. La Maison recommends eating it with a fork, which is how it is served in the store's cafe. But fingers do the job just fine. La Maison du Chocolat, which has another store at 1018 Madison Avenue (78th Street), sells bouchees ($4.25 each) in other shapes, with pistachio, nougat, raisin and milk chocolate fillings. But the coconut gets my vote.</p>
