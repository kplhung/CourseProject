        <p>THE inland heart of South Jersey is a vast national preserve, a million acres of former ocean bottom, now a primeval terrain of craggy pines and impenetrable forest scrub. It's strangely beautiful and fragrant flatland, but not a place anyone would expect to reap great harvests.</p>
        <p>For almost a century, however, farms large and small have done just that. Sandwiched between showy Atlantic City and stately Philadelphia, the Pine Barrens of South Jersey is prime blueberry country. This lean, sandy and acidic soil puts forth about 40 million pounds of the berries, enough to make the state second only to Michigan in blueberry production. This summer's consistent, merciful weather -- which was dismal for corn and tomatoes -- was ideal for blueberries. It has been the best harvest in recent memory in Burlington County.</p>
        <p>Every year, New Jersey blueberries dominate the market in New York from late June to mid-August, filling in between the first blueberries of summer, shipped up from Florida, and the last of the season, from Michigan. Twenty-seven other states and Canada produce the fruit in season, but in many ways, New Jersey is their true home, the place where the modern berry was developed and definitely where it thrives.</p>
        <p>There's something irresistible about blueberries, and it shows on the freshly stained blue smiles of farmers, pickers, packers and executives who work in close proximity to them here. Blueberries have a gracefully subdued burst of sweetness that fades on the tongue and leaves you wanting more. Although berries early in the season are known for their size, and late ones for their intensity, nearly all blueberries achieve an easy balance of sweet and tart, a dewy, baritone berryness with a suggestion of cinnamon and a slightly tannic finish.</p>
        <p>Few fruits fit as easily into summer meals. Their easy balance of sweet and tart brighten everything from breakfast granola and pancakes to sophisticated desserts like the elegant sour cream cake at March restaurant in Manhattan. Even better, they have recently been found to be especially beneficial to health.</p>
        <p>Blueberries are a completely native American crop, but the kind most common today originated in the 1920's, when Elizabeth White, the enterprising daughter of a cranberry farmer in Pemberton, N.J., set out to improve upon the wild huckleberries that grew in the forest thickets and swamps. She selected cuttings and bred bushes that form the largest, sweetest-tasting berries, with the darkest blue color and the tiniest seeds. In collaboration with Dr. Frederick Coville, a botanist in the federal Agriculture Department, who had also been working to improve the huckleberry, she developed the modern blueberry. These are called high-bush blueberries to distinguish them from the wild, ground-hugging low-bush variety common in Maine and New England.</p>
        <p>There are more than 30 varieties of cultivated blueberries, like Blue Crop, Chanticleer, Blue Jay and Weymouth, but they are nearly indistinguishable to the palate of the average consumer. Growers contend that in blind taste tests they can identify varieties, but blueberries are rarely segregated in harvesting. Variety serves primarily to give farmers as long a season as possible, since some varieties ripen earlier, some at the height of the season, roughly July 15 to July 30, and others late. Distinctions -- not only of variety, but of origin -- have become less and less apparent to consumers, now that  blueberries are a year-round fruit, shipped in from South American countries like Chile in winter.</p>
        <p>This season, you would be hard pressed to find American farmers in better circumstances than the blueberry growers here.</p>
        <p>In Hammonton, a hundred pallets of blueberries, about 50,000 pounds, is barely a few  hours' work for Dennis Doyle's team of roughly 1,000 pickers, who move down the rows with quick-fire efficiency, nudging each berry off the bush into a can or bucket, to be consolidated in sturdy yellow plastic lugs. Mr. Doyle, a former president of the Tru-Blu Cooperative in New Lisbon, N.J., which packages and markets berries, is the product manager for the Atlantic Blueberry Company, which bills itself as the largest family-run blueberry farm in the world. Its 1,300 acres produce nearly a quarter of the state's annual yield.</p>
        <p>Sixty percent of Atlantic's business is in fresh blueberries, sorted and boxed in a warehouse alongside the fields. Most are destined for markets on the East Coast, within a day's drive of South Jersey. The rest are processed berries, the frozen blueberries that end up in a Mrs. Smith's blueberry pie or at the bottom of a Dannon yogurt cup.</p>
        <p>Other blueberry farmers cater more to the pick-your-own market. Stanley Worrell, a spry 54-year-old with a joshing manner, has a 40-acre farm, a swatch of weedy white sand framed by pine forest. His Blue Crop plants, in straight, orderly rows, are rangy shrubs that grow to shoulder height at maturity. Stiff, slightly waxy green leaves partly conceal clusters of marble-size berries, whose color is equal parts indigo and battleship gray.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Worrell walks the rows, he can't resist snacking. Neither can the Manhattan couple he greets, wearing sun hats and sandals, blue tin cans cinched around their waists and brimming with fruit. Although he sells already-picked blueberries for only 34 cents a pound more, the retirees and suburban families who turn out by the dozens to spend a day picking in the fields don't do it to save money. ''They bring their kids and grandkids and picnic under the pines,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the steady retail traffic on Mr. Worrell's farm represents a small fraction of the 125,000 pounds of berries he sells in a good season. Most of his berries go to the Tru-Blu Cooperative, whose members pay a 10 percent commission for its services: inspecting the berries, providing packing materials, consolidating the harvest and then selling the berries to wholesalers, greengrocers and supermarkets.</p>
        <p>Even in the best of years, small blueberry farmers rarely survive on that crop alone.  From September to May, Mr. Worrell works full time, as an instructor at a nearby center for juvenile offenders. Fred Dietrich, the president of Tru-Blu, was a humanities professor at Glassboro State University in New Jersey before he retired; he now farms blueberries at Fred Plus Three Farm. ''I'm only in it for the love of it,'' Mr. Dietrich said. ''My wife calls it Fred's folly.'' Although Mr. Dietrich's roots in the area go back several generations, neither of his sons plans to take over the business. And of the 238 farms that created the cooperative in the early 1940's, he said, only 41 remain.</p>
        <p>Harvesting and selling blueberries takes only 60 days, but growing them requires steady, year-round toil. Cultivated blueberry bushes (Vaccinium corymbosum) grow for three years before they become fully productive and produce for about eight years before they must be replaced. Like grapevines, each bush must be pruned and tended by hand each winter. The soil must be weeded and irrigated, its chemical composition monitored to keep acidity balanced, and insects and fungi must be warded off.  And then there are mammals to contend with, particularly deer, and birds.</p>
        <p>Most of the fresh berries Mr. Worrell sells are picked by hand, because they command a better price. Machine harvesters, both the deluxe, Zamboni-like model and the smaller kind towed by a tractor, are boxy contraptions that straddle the bushes, brushing berries off with spring-loaded feelers. The berries collect in a trough, and a conveyor deposits them in a bin.</p>
        <p>The machines, though, are rougher on the berries and significantly less picky than the pickers. Machine-harvested berries are most often sold to companies like Ocean Spray, to be made into purees, syrups and juices.</p>
        <p>Even the most subtle flaw in a crop, the presence of a green berry in a pint, or a faintly darker cast to the lot, will influence the price. Blueberries are moderately perishable; handpicked at the perfect moment of firm ripeness, they will keep 10 to 15 days if refrigerated. (They also freeze extremely well.)</p>
        <p>The Tru-Blu Cooperative is the first test of a farmer's product. On a radiant Sunday afternoon, a steady stream of trucks laden with tall pallets of blueberries pulled up to the cinder-block storage shed and loading dock in New Lisbon. Sheri Sansone, who manages the operation in season, drove a forklift, hoisting pallets of berries from the trucks onto the dock, to be ferried to the walk-in cooler to chill before pickup the next morning.</p>
        <p>When she wasn't on the forklift, Ms. Sansone was on the phone, fielding calls from buyers for supermarkets and cajoling growers to harvest more berries. In her role as  the Tru-Blu inspector, she picked through a pallet of pint containers and removed a picture-perfect sample: rotund berries with taut skins and perfect bloom, the powdery, silvery appearance of a blueberry still on the bush.</p>
        <p>For all the domestic demand for blueberries, a market is building overseas. The bilberry, a close relative to the blueberry, is native to France and parts of Europe, but so far New Jersey berries are not big sellers there. In Japan, they are used to make jelly candies and other treats, packaged to appeal to children and teenagers. Korea and China are also starting to buy blueberries.</p>
        <p>Growers in New Jersey are keen to open new markets, because every year seems to find new competition, both from large growers in the United States and from Central America. In the last 20 years, varieties of blueberry have been developed that are suited to the hotter climates of Southern states like Florida and North Carolina, which now produce millions of pounds of fruit.</p>
        <p>But at least for the moment, blueberries are doing well, helped by a 1996 study by the Agriculture Department at the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, which ranked 40 fruits and vegetables for antioxidant properties, which are said to mitigate the effects of aging on the body. The study put blueberries on top, with blackberries, kale and garlic following. The  findings were well publicized last year and led to what has been a recognizable, if not huge, uptick in blueberry sales.</p>
        <p>But in the end, what makes blueberries irresistible is their taste. A fistful of fresh berries might be the most expedient way to experience them, but cooking with them, for those who can defer gratification, can intensify their flavor. Heating blueberries moderately with a little water and sugar makes a simple, versatile sauce. After a few minutes on the flame, the berries redden and liquefy, reducing to a vivid blueberry concentrate, delicious drizzled over vanilla ice cream or a pound cake. The syrup keeps for several days in the refrigerator.</p>
        <p>Although they are frequently combined with other berries in baked desserts, it's better to keep blueberries to themselves, to avoid outflanking them with an assertive strawberry or raspberry flavor. Lemon, lime and cinnamon, used sparingly, can complement and enhance the natural essence of blueberry. Or toss a cinnamon stick or even a bay leaf (a distant cousin of the blueberry) into the simmering sauce to add complexity.</p>
        <p>But always, be careful not to oversweeten blueberry desserts, which too many cooks do. Go easy on the sugar and, instead, add more blueberries. A handful more never hurt a recipe.</p>
        <p>BLUEBERRY-BANANA PANCAKES  Adapted from ''The Black Dog Summer on the Vineyard Cookbook,''  by Joe Hall and Elaine Sullivan (Little, Brown &amp; Company, $25.95)  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1/2 cup buckwheat flour</p>
        <p>1/2 cup whole wheat flour  4 tablespoons cornmeal  2 tablespoons sugar  2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
        <p>3/4 teaspoon baking soda  1 teaspoon salt  3 teaspoons cinnamon  4 eggs  2 1/2 cups whole milk  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  1 pint fresh blueberries  1 thinly sliced banana.</p>
        <p>1. Mix dry ingredients together in a medium-size bowl. In a separate bowl, beat eggs with 2 1/2 cups milk and the melted butter.</p>
        <p>2. Add wet mixture to dry ingredients and mix gently with a wooden spoon. Add more milk if mixture is too thick. Gently fold in blueberries.</p>
        <p>3. Heat a griddle, adding a small pat of butter. Ladle batter onto hot griddle and place three or four slices of banana on each pancake. Cook until tops are dimpled with tiny bubbles, then flip and finish cooking for a minute longer. Serve with butter and maple syrup.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>BLUEBERRY SHRUB  Adapted from ''American Home Cooking,'' by Cheryl Alters Jamison  and Bill Jamison (Broadway Books, 1999)</p>
        <p>Time: 15 minutes</p>
        <p>2 pints blueberries, rinsed and de-stemmed  1 1/2 cups sugar  1 cup brandy  Lemon wedges  Mint sprigs.</p>
        <p>1. Combine blueberries and sugar in a saucepan with  1/3 cup water. Cook at a low simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until blueberries are very soft. Strain juice through a fine sieve into a pitcher (or using a funnel, into a clean, empty wine bottle). Press gently with the back of a spoon to release all juice from berries. (If desired, pass juice through a cheesecloth to remove  seeds.) Add brandy to pitcher or bottle, and refrigerate. Shrub will keep for several  weeks.</p>
        <p>2. To serve, fill a tall glass with ice. Then fill it halfway with cold water or sparkling water. Top off glass with shrub, and garnish with a mint sprig and a lemon wedge.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>ORANGE SOUR CREAM CAKE WITH BLUEBERRY COMPOTE  Adapted from March  Time: 45 minutes, plus cooling time</p>
        <p>For the cake:  1 1/2 cups sifted cake flour</p>
        <p>3/4 cup sugar</p>
        <p>3/4 teaspoon baking powder</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon baking soda  Grated rind of 1 orange  Pinch of salt  4 1/2 ounces (9 tablespoons) butter, at room temperature</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sour cream  3 large egg yolks</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon orange extract</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract  Nonstick vegetable oil spray</p>
        <p>For the compote:</p>
        <p>1/4 cup lemon juice  1 tablespoon cornstarch</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sugar  2 pints (8 cups) fresh blueberries, washed and dried  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  1 teaspoon elderberry essence, optional (see note)  Pinch of salt.</p>
        <p>1. To prepare the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In bowl of a mixer with a paddle attachment, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, orange rind and salt. Cut butter into small pieces and add to bowl. Mix at low speed until crumbly.</p>
        <p>2. Add  1/4 cup sour cream. Mix at medium speed until smooth and paste-like. Scrape bowl, and add remaining  1/4 cup sour cream and egg yolks. Beat at high speed for 1 minute. Scrape bowl, and add orange extract and vanilla extract. Beat at high speed until light and fluffy, about 1 more minute.</p>
        <p>3. Coat bottom and sides of an 8-inch cake pan with nonstick spray. Scrape batter into pan, and smooth with a spatula. Bake until top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven. Cool.</p>
        <p>4. To prepare compote: In a medium glass, enameled or other nonreactive saucepan, combine lemon juice, cornstarch and sugar. Mix until smooth. Add blueberries, vanilla extract, elderberry essence and salt. Stir gently to mix. Place over medium-low heat, and simmer just until liquid thickens and blueberries darken in color. Remove from heat, and transfer to a bowl.</p>
        <p>5. To serve, remove cake from pan. Slice, and serve topped with blueberry compote.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
