        <p>Here is a nugget you might want to pass on to your boss: A new survey shows that workers believe they do their best brainstorming about their jobs when they are not actually working.</p>
        <p>In fact, to hear the respondents tell it, the ideal breeding ground for ideas is a place of relaxation far from the office, like a bed or a shower stall.</p>
        <p>The poll, by the online recruiter CareerEngine, also showed a high level of job dissatisfaction among respondents -- and an equally common perception that their bosses were unware of it. Little wonder, says John Remington, a professor at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota.</p>
