      <abstract>
        <p>Sen Sam Brownback Op-Ed article notes he, Christian Midwestern Republican, and Sen Joseph I Lieberman, Jewish Northeastern Democrat and Vice Pres Al Gore's running mate, are frequent allies in Senate; holds they are part of political alliance emerging between theologically orthodox Christians and Jews who share belief in moral order ordained by God; notes vice president's principles and positions tend to be subsumed by president's agenda</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I have often been asked how it is that Joe Lieberman and I are frequent allies in the Senate. We wrote, along with former Senator Dan Coats, legislation to provide vouchers to disadvantaged children in the public schools of the District of Columbia. We have repeatedly joined in calling on Hollywood to stop producing vulgar and violent entertainment. We cosponsored a law providing humanitarian help to religious groups being persecuted in southern Sudan. Away from Capitol Hill, we are honorary co-chairmen of the Healthy Culture Initiative, which promotes charities and social projects -- including those that are faith-based -- in local communities.</p>
        <p>I suspect Senator Lieberman has been asked as often as I have how we work together so easily. He is a Jewish Democrat from the Northeast; I am a Christian Republican from the Midwest. But our frequent collaboration is, I believe, based on more than a collegial professional relationship.</p>

        <p>I have often been asked how it is that Joe Lieberman and I are frequent allies in the Senate. We wrote, along with former Senator Dan Coats, legislation to provide vouchers to disadvantaged children in the public schools of the District of Columbia. We have repeatedly joined in calling on Hollywood to stop producing vulgar and violent entertainment. We cosponsored a law providing humanitarian help to religious groups being persecuted in southern Sudan. Away from Capitol Hill, we are honorary co-chairmen of the Healthy Culture Initiative, which promotes charities and social projects -- including those that are faith-based -- in local communities.</p>
        <p>I suspect Senator Lieberman has been asked as often as I have how we work together so easily. He is a Jewish Democrat from the Northeast; I am a Christian Republican from the Midwest. But our frequent collaboration is, I believe, based on more than a collegial professional relationship.</p>
        <p>In a time when families of all faiths feel their values are under attack, Senator Lieberman and I are part of a political alliance that is quite logically emerging between theologically orthodox Christians and Jews. Certainly, there are significant differences in outlook. But there is one sense where these two groups clearly and strongly agree: We share a belief in universal Truths, in a moral order ordained by God and discovered, not created, by man. That shared conviction often translates into similar ideas of how to improve our laws and our society.</p>
        <p>On many issues, including Social Security reform, missile defense and tort reform, Senator Lieberman has followed his conscience across party lines, making his record on these issues more conservative than Al Gore's. It remains to be seen how the two men's differences will play out as the presidential campaign takes off in earnest.</p>
        <p>Including Senator Lieberman on the ticket does give much-needed integrity and decorum to the Democrats. History and experience shows us, however, that the vice president's principles and positions are subsumed by the president's agenda. If we are to renew our culture and restore honor to the presidency, leadership will have to come from the top of the ticket.</p>
