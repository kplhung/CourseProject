        <p>The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles has turned down a request for clemency from Oliver Cruz, who was sentenced to death for the rape and murder of an Air Force enlisted woman. Mr. Cruz, who defense psychologists say is mentally retarded, is to be executed at 6 p.m. today.</p>
        <p>The 18-member board voted unanimously on Monday to refuse the clemency. It gave no reason for its refusal. The board has rejected all but one of the 74 clemency requests from death row inmates since Gov. George W. Bush took office in 1995.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Cruz's trial, the state did not contest the defense's evidence that Mr. Cruz was mentally retarded and had an I.Q. as low as 64. People with an I.Q. below 70 are generally considered to be mentally retarded.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, the San Antonio district attorney's office, which prosecuted Mr. Cruz, began circulating a 1989 report showing his I.Q. as 83, said Barbara Hervey, an assistant district attorney there.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hervey said she had no idea why the report had not been introduced earlier and been made part of the record. She said the district attorney received the report yesterday based on a request to prison officials last week. The district attorney, Susan D. Reed, declined to make a copy of the report available.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Cruz's trial, the prosecutor had argued that one reason to execute Mr. Cruz was that he ''may not be smart'' and that that made him ''more dangerous'' to society.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cruz's lawyer, Jeffrey Pokorak, angered at the last-minute disclosure of the I.Q. report by the state, said, ''They know they should not be killing a mentally retarded person, so now they are coming up with new evidence that says he is not mentally retarded.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pokorak has asked for a full evidentiary hearing on the question of Mr. Cruz's mental retardation.</p>
        <p>The United States Supreme Court is reviewing a request for a stay of execution filed on Friday by Mr. Pokorak, who argues that the jury was not properly instructed to consider the evidence of mental retardation. If the court turns down the appeal, Mr. Cruz's fate will be in the hands of the lieutenant governor, Rick Perry, who is sitting in for Governor Bush, who is out of state. Under Texas law, the governor can grant only a one-time 30-day delay of execution.</p>
        <p>The American Bar Association urged Mr. Bush late Monday evening not to go forward with the execution.</p>
        <p>''The execution of persons who are mentally retarded serves no principled purpose and demeans our system of justice,'' Martha W. Barrett, the organization's president wrote to Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The European Union called on Mr. Bush yesterday not to execute Mr. Cruz, saying the execution of someone who is mentally retarded violated international human rights norms.</p>
        <p>''We urge you to demonstrate compassion with regard to this case,'' it said in the letter to Mr. Bush.</p>
