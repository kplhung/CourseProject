        <p>The Choir of King's College, Cambridge, traces its charter back to 1441, when Henry VI founded the college and let it be known that he wanted a student choir to sing the daily services in his chapel.</p>
        <p>The chapel itself is stunning, both visually and as a place to hear choral music (and, no doubt, to sing it), and in the last century recordings and broadcasts have conveyed an impression of the all-male choir's sound to listeners around the world. The choir also tours, and on Monday evening it made its Mostly Mozart debut at Alice Tully Hall, with its director, Stephen Cleobury, on the podium.</p>
        <p>Several things were immediately apparent. One was that the choir's reputation had made it a tremendous draw: given the lines outside Alice Tully Hall, which was filled to capacity, the concert would probably have sold out if it had been at Avery Fisher. But the intimacy and immediacy of the performance would have been lost.</p>
        <p>The second instantly striking aspect of the performance -- and, fortunately, a fleeting one -- was that because Tully's sound is so dry compared with that of the grand chapel sound the choir is used to that it took the singers a few moments to adjust.</p>
        <p>In the opening Bach motet, ''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'' (BWV 226), one heard entrances from the boy sopranos that had a slightly rough edge, something that would have been smoothed over in a more resonant hall.</p>
        <p>That said, once the choir had the measure of the room, it produced an exquisitely clean, transparent sound. In the program's twin centerpieces, Mozart's Missa Brevis in D (K. 194) and Missa Brevis in F (K. 192), the blend could not hardly have been better or more carefully balanced.</p>
        <p>The pure, angelic sound of the sopranos and altos was particularly effective in the Kyrie and Agnus Dei of each work, and Mr. Cleobury's brisk tempos underscored the concision and directness of Mozart's writing.</p>
        <p>The program also included another Bach motet, ''Lobet den Herrn alle Heiden'' (BWV 230) and two motets by Brahms, the Bach-like ''Schaffe in mir, Gott'' (Op. 29, No.2) and the more sublimely chromatic ''Warum ist das Licht gegeben'' (Op. 74, No. 1). In some ways, though, the choir's best work was in its encores. Mr. Cleobury led a haunting performance of Britten's ''Hymn to the Virgin'' and polished accounts of two of the Rachmaninoff Vespers.</p>
        <p>In the Bach works, the choir was accompanied by Nina Maria Lee, cellist; Leigh Mesh, bassist; and Benjamin Bayl, organist.</p>
        <p>Those players were joined in the Mozart by Mark Steinberg and Serena Canin, violinists.</p>
