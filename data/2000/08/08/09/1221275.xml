        <p>There may be no need for alarm. But if you look at the stock tables, those fabulously rich hockey naifs who bought the Islanders for $185 million aren't so rich anymore.</p>
        <p>Charles B. Wang and Sanjay Kumar acquired the beleaguered Islanders in April and immediately ignited the hopes of the faithful that at long last the team had owners with plenty of cash and confidence.</p>
        <p>Wang is the chairman of Computer Associates International, Kumar its president. They're still wealthy but the stock market has pummeled them into the boards in recent months. Computer Associates' stock price has been tumbling -- in part because it hasn't met earnings estimates -- since Wang's name first emerged as a suitor for the Islanders.</p>
        <p>*On March 9, when Wang's name surfaced in connection with the Islanders, his stock was worth $2.2 billion. Kumar's shares were worth a healthy $374.7 million.</p>
        <p>*On April 11, as their purchase of the Islanders drew nigh, Wang's stake was down to $2 billion, Kumar's to $336 million.</p>
        <p>*On April 26, the day they announced their purchase of the Islanders, Wang's shares were worth $1.86 billion, Kumar's $309.3 million.</p>
        <p>*But on July 5, the stock plummeted by 42 percent to $29.4375. Now, a month later, the shares are lower still, closing yesterday at $25.9375.</p>
        <p>That plunge means Wang is no longer a Computer Associates billionaire. Based on yesterday's closing price, Wang's 33.9 million shares are worth $879.3 million; Kumar's 5.68 million shares, $147.3 million.</p>
        <p>When your stock holdings fall about 60 percent in five months, you have to wonder if the bottom has been reached. Islander fans, so familiar with the sensation of the bottom, have to wonder if Wang and Kumar's disappearing wealth will affect how they operate the franchise or the financing of a new arena.</p>
        <p>A Computer Associates spokesman said the ''premise is ridiculous.'' He added: ''The decline in the share price of Computer Associates and Charles and Sanjay's part-ownership of the New York Islanders are not related in any way.''</p>
        <p>Visser Back to CBS</p>
        <p>Lesley Visser worked as a CBS Sports reporter for 10 years, then defected to ABC and ESPN for seven years. But in June, she was cut as ''Monday Night Football's'' sideline reporter. Yesterday, after ABC and ESPN released her from contracts that had about two years left, she returned to CBS.</p>
        <p>''After a tumultuous six weeks, this is a day of celebration,'' said Visser, who will report for ''The N.F.L. Today,'' the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament, the United States Open tennis championships and CBS News's ''The Early Show.''</p>
        <p>''I thought CBS would be a a great place to grow,'' she said, noting that ABC and ESPN tried to keep her, in part by asking her to be host of ''Wide World of Sports,'' the defunct anthology series that ABC may revive.</p>
        <p>She chose not to criticize the producer Don Ohlmeyer's decision to replace her with Melissa Stark and Eric Dickerson.</p>
        <p>Kevin Johnson to NBC</p>
        <p>Kevin Johnson, the former Phoenix Sun, is the latest contestant in NBC's search for a top-notch, unconflicted analyst for the ''N.B.A. Showtime'' studio show, now that Isiah Thomas has left to coach the Pacers.</p>
        <p>John Salley seemed lost a few seasons ago. More recently, Thomas was too guarded and coy and should have left last year because of the conflict in owning the Continental Basketball Association while negotiating to make it the N.B.A.'s minor league.</p>
        <p>''I think the reason they hired me is that I didn't have a sense of being attached to any interest or business, which lets me speak my mind,'' Johnson said by telephone yesterday.</p>
        <p>Lots of Billy Martin</p>
        <p>ESPN Classic's nightly SportsCentury series has been turning out stellar hourlong biographies of personalities as diverse as Moe Berg, Connie Hawkins and Nile Kinnick. But on Monday and last night, the series ran its first two-parter -- on Billy Martin. Martin's life was packed with drama and nine major league managing jobs (five of them with the Yankees), but two hours of Alfred Manuel Martin? No one else in the series has merited that treatment.</p>
        <p>''Usually, less is more, but I felt Billy was compelling enough, and there would have been too much to throw out,'' said Vince Doria, executive producer of ESPN Classic.</p>
        <p>Mark Shapiro, vice president and general manager of the network, added, ''Even if it's unfair to the other athletes, it's good TV.''</p>
