        <p>For several reasons, ''Live Through This,'' the dramatic series that has its premiere tonight on MTV, ought to come with a sort of reverse parental advisory. Something like ''May not be suitable for viewing by people who were at or near the original Woodstock.''</p>
        <p>For one thing, there's the premise of the show: a once-mighty rock band reunites to go on tour, with the band members taking along their children, ages 16 to 23. But the jarring thing, for viewers of a certain age, is that the heyday of this has-been band was in the late 70's and early 80's. That, apparently, is what today's MTV audience thinks of as ancient rock history. Ouch. Despite what Mick Jagger sang (in 1964), time, time, time is not on our side.</p>

        <p>For several reasons, ''Live Through This,'' the dramatic series that has its premiere tonight on MTV, ought to come with a sort of reverse parental advisory. Something like ''May not be suitable for viewing by people who were at or near the original Woodstock.''</p>
        <p>For one thing, there's the premise of the show: a once-mighty rock band reunites to go on tour, with the band members taking along their children, ages 16 to 23. But the jarring thing, for viewers of a certain age, is that the heyday of this has-been band was in the late 70's and early 80's. That, apparently, is what today's MTV audience thinks of as ancient rock history. Ouch. Despite what Mick Jagger sang (in 1964), time, time, time is not on our side.</p>
        <p>Also unsettling, for the geezer-age viewer, is the dialogue of the show's young adults, which is drenched in slang of the moment, or perhaps it's slang that the writers just made up hoping that it would become slang of the moment by the time the show hit the air. ''He's such a buzzkill'' and ''That would be totally spank'' and ''He would be stoked to see me,'' and so on.</p>
        <p>After a half-hour of this, it begins to become unclear what's slang and what isn't. When a band member, Drake Taylor (Ron Lea), tells his son, Travis (Matthew Carey), that one of the group's old CD's now sells for $100 on eBay, Travis replies, ''Steep.'' Is he merely saying, ''That price seems steep''? Or is ''steep'' slang for, ''I hate you, and the all-black outfit doesn't work with your paunch''? Hard to say. In any case, the effect is to cause the viewer to start seeing slang everywhere -- in the kitchen utensils, in the mop closet. It's cuisinarting, to say the least.</p>
        <p>Of course, ''Live Through This,'' MTV's first attempt at an hourlong dramatic series, has no intention of appealing to anyone old enough to have been at Woodstock, or even anyone old enough to have been fans of the Jackson Decker Band, the fictional group in the show. The aim is much younger, and the show's writers go for the target in a way that is almost manipulative. ''Live Through This'' (a 1994 album by Courtney Love's band, Hole, has the same title) is the world as a teenager might create it: the young people are the smart ones, their parents the ones in need of shepherding and discipline.</p>
        <p>Most obvious is that the band's tour is organized and run by Chase (Tom Lock), the son of Keith Rooney (David Nerman), one of the band's guitarists. He has an M.B.A. from Stanford, a knack for resolving crises, and more sense than the four band members combined. And, when he's not lecturing one of them the way a parent might lecture a wayward child, he keeps tabs on his sister, Olivia (Jessica Welch), who is not quite as straight-and-narrow as he is.</p>
        <p>There is also Lu (Sarah Manninen), who selflessly keeps her mother, the band's torch singer (played by Jennifer Dale), away from alcohol and such, or at least tries to. Even sweet and innocent Darby (Jane McGregor), who at 16 is the youngest of the children on the tour, turns out to be a parental life-saver. Though her dad, Rick Parsons (Bruce Dinsmore), the group's drummer, is now neurotically overprotective, it emerges that back in the glory days he was the band's bad boy; it was Darby's birth that jolted him off of the Hendrix-Joplin-Etc. Highway.</p>
        <p>Consciously or unconsciously, the young-is-better worldview of ''Live Through This'' also extends to the performers. The actors who play the band members seem to be sleepwalking much of the time, and who can blame them, since they're playing stereotypes. The younger actors are also playing stereotypes but are more spank about it.</p>
        <p>In truth, the show would have been much better, downright fun even, as a comedy. As a drama, despite the original premise, it falls back on the same old parent-child tensions that have already been explored, and better, by other shows. Still, with the soap-operalike possibilities for couplings and recouplings, the music and all that swell slang -- well, it's easy to be hoovered by the show, if you're not too waxy-buildup.</p>
        <p>If only the dialogue were a little less self-consciously hip. ''Drake's obsessed with that guitar,'' Lu tells Travis in one scene. ''Once he put it up for auction at a Save the Music benefit, then yanked it at the last second. Sting still won't talk to him.''</p>
        <p>That Sting -- he's always going brillo.</p>
