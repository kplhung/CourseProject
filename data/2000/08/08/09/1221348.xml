        <p>LACKAMP-Judith A. died peacefully on August 4, 2000 in her home. A native of Cleveland, OH, Judy lived in NYC for nearly 40 years. Judy is survived by her brother William A. Lackamp, niece Lori Shoemake and husband James, grandnieces Devon and Emily. She touched our lives in many wonderful ways. She lived her life with grace and dignity. God took her with her grace and dignity intact. Remember what she said, ''Do something nice for someone, it will make you both feel good.'' We all felt good in her presence and blessed to have her in our lives. She will remain lovingly in our hearts forever. Contributions may be made in her honor in lieu of flowers to Bide-a-Wee Animal Shelter, Box 5664 GPO, NY, NY 10087-5664 and/or Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen, 296 9th Ave., NY, NY 10001. Memorial service will be held on August 25th at The Union Club, 101 East 69 St., NYC from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.</p>
