        <p>The productivity of American workers increased sharply in the second quarter, pushing labor costs down, the government said yesterday. The report bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates later this month.</p>
        <p>The Labor Department said that worker productivity rose at a 5.3 percent annual rate in the latest quarter, higher than economists' expectations and nearly triple the revised rate of 1.9 percent for the first quarter.</p>
        <p>With the gains in productivity, unit labor costs, a broad measure of how much businesses pay for unit of output, fell a surprising 0.1 percent in the second quarter, after rising 1.9 percent in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Productivity -- workers' output per hour -- has risen steeply in recent years as computer technology and other innovations have allowed businesses to press workers to do more tasks in the same amount of time. The productivity gains have also allowed businesses to absorb wage increases without raising the price of goods and services they produce, or to increase their profit margins.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said in recent Congressional testimony that increased productivity was helping to restrain inflationary pressures, and that much of the gain in productivity could be nonreversible. Federal Reserve policy makers meet on interest rates on Aug. 22.</p>
        <p>In a year-over-year comparison, productivity rose at a 5.1 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the biggest increase since the third quarter of 1983. And compared with the second quarter of 1999, unit labor costs fell 0.4 percent, the first year-over-year drop since the first quarter of 1984.</p>
        <p>Hourly compensation rose 5.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with 3.9 percent in the first quarter. But adjusted for inflation, compensation rose only 1.6 percent against a flat reading in the first quarter.</p>
