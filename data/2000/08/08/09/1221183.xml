        <p>Organic Bar and Grill</p>
        <p>The Avalon Bar-Grill has opened in the Avalon Hotel, 16 East 32nd Street, replacing the Coach House. The restaurant, run by Dan Kobin, who owns Dano 254 nearby, has an American menu with mainly organic ingredients. The chef is Mark Slutzky, formerly of Judson Grill.</p>
        <p>Kosher With Class</p>
        <p>Serving high-end kosher food seems a sure way to attract a dedicated clientele. So Berkeley Bar &amp; Grill, Drew Nieporent's short-lived place in the Sony Building atrium, has become Shallots NY. Its owner and chef is Laura Frankel, who owns a kosher Mediterranean place, Shallots, in Chicago.</p>
        <p>''Kosher is always a destination restaurant,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Likewise, the space on East 49th Street that was Blackbird will become Prime Grill, a kosher steakhouse that is to open next month.</p>
        <p>Sip, Then Shop</p>
        <p>Nicola Marzovilla, who owns I Trulli at 122 East 27th Street, has opened Vino, a shop a few doors away at No. 143, specializing in Italian wines and spirits. Charles Scicolone, the wine director at I Trulli, is a partner in the shop, which will start by selling the 400 wines, many from Southern Italy, on the list in the restaurant and its wine bar.</p>
        <p>Chefs on the Move</p>
        <p>Michael Otsuka, the chef at Thalia in the theater district, is leaving in two weeks. He hasn't decided what his next move will be, and a new chef has not been hired. Thalia's pastry chef, Verite Mazzola, returned to California last month and has been replaced by Robert Straklan.</p>
        <p>Giuseppe Lentini is no longer the chef at Elio's, 1621 Second Avenue (85th Street). He plans to open his own place, Lentini's, nearby.</p>
        <p>Short Orders</p>
        <p>Eight Mile Creek, the Australian restaurant at 240 Mulberry Street (Prince Street), has opened its downstairs area as a lounge.</p>
        <p>What's wrong with West 58th Street? So.Barth's, which opened last fall at No. 68, has now closed. And at No. 8, Jack's Fifth, which had replaced Pondicherry, has closed, too.</p>
