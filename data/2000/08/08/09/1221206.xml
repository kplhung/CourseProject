        <p>FRANCE: CONCORDE INQUIRY DELAY  Asbestos in the debris of an Air France Concorde that crashed in July, killing 113, has forced investigators outside Paris to stop work because of health concerns, an air transport police official said. Of 22 samples, three revealed traces of asbestos. Transfer and reassembly of the debris have been suspended until the particles are removed, which could take another week, the spokesman said.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>MEXICO: ABORTION BILL PROTESTS  Responding to demonstrations against a Guanajuato state bill that would forbid abortion even in rape cases, the state's governor, Ramon Martin Huerta, said he would meet with opponents and advocates of the measure before signing it into law. The bill has aroused fears that President-elect Vicente Fox's conservative and staunchly Catholic National Action Party will try to impose similar legislation elsewhere. Abortion is illegal in most states except in rape cases.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: CORRUPTION ALLEGATIONS  In a letter to President Ernesto Zedillo, Tourism Minister Oscar Espinosa asked for a leave of absence to fight allegations that he siphoned off some $45 million from government coffers during his tenure as the last unelected mayor of Mexico City. The accusations were made by the Mexico City prosecutor's office, which has been run by an opposition leftist party since it won the capital's first-ever municipal election in 1997.</p>
        <p>(Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>PERU: RIVAL EASES CRITICISM  Alejandro Toledo, who lost the race for president, softened his stance against President Alberto K. Fujimori and said he would join with the government in seeking a solution to the country's political crisis. Mr. Toledo, left, had previously called Mr. Fujimori's May election illegitimate. He made known his change of heart as an Organization of American States representative arrived to mediate a settlement that would allow more freedom of the press and independent elections.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>INDONESIA: CHARGES AGAINST SUHARTO  Prosecutors formally filed corruption charges against former President Suharto, who could stand trial this month, according to the head of the judges' panel in the case, Lalu Mariyun. The charge papers accuse Mr. Suharto of causing losses to the state of more than half a billion dollars during his 32-year rule.</p>

        <p>INDIA: CASE AGAINST HINDU  The Bombay High Court overruled a month-old lower court decision dismissing incitement-to-riot charges against the militant Hindu leader Bal Thackery. The ruling paves the way for Mr. Thackery to stand trial for writing inflammatory articles during 1992-93 Hindu-Muslim riots that killed more than 1,000.</p>

        <p>THE KOREAS: REUNIONS NEAR FOR 200  North and South Korea exchanged the names of 100 people from each side who are to cross their heavily guarded border beginning Tuesday for four-day family reunions. The visits will be the first since 50 North and South Koreans were allowed across 15 years ago. The lists were exchanged at the truce village at Panmunjom. Officials also exchanged notes guaranteeing the visitors' safe passage.</p>

        <p>CHINA: CONTROLS ON THE WEB  The government has shut a dissident Web site, the New Culture Forum, according to a group called Human Rights in China, which described the site as the first not based abroad. China is promoting the Web's economic benefits while trying to block its use as a political weapon.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>LEBANON: U.N. REPRESENTATIVE  Secretary General Kofi Annan assigned Rolf G. Knutsson, a high-ranking aide, as his special representative in southern Lebanon for at least the next six months, as an enlarged United Nations peacekeeping force settles in along the border with Israel. Mr. Knutsson, a Swede, has been director for Europe and Latin America in the peacekeeping department and was later in charge of political affairs in the secretary general's office. In the 1980's he had peacekeeping assignments in both Lebanon and Israel.</p>

        <p>EGYPT: THE RABBI'S SLUR  The general secretariat of the Arab League condemned as racist a recent sermon by the spiritual leader of Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas party, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who alluded to Palestinians as ''snakes.'' ''Such comments display the hatred this rabbi has toward Muslims and Arabs, particularly Palestinians,'' the league said in a statement, warning that ''an atmosphere favorable to peaceful coexistence'' was in danger.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>NAMIBIA: SUPPORT FOR ZIMBABWEAN  Concluding their meeting in Windhoek, 10 southern African leaders defended President Robert Mugabe, left, and his land redistribution program. The presidents -- who included Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, Festus Mogae of Botswana and Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique -- said Mr. Mugabe had promised to redistribute land peacefully. Mr. Mugabe, who supports the continuing invasions of white-owned farms by black squatters, has flouted several court orders to remove the squatters.</p>

        <p>CONGO: REFUGEE DIASPORA  The United Nations high commissioner for refugees says three of Congo's neighbors -- Uganda, the Central African Republic and the Congo Republic -- have been bearing the brunt of its human exodus. More than 2,500 people have arrived in Uganda since late July, an agency spokesman estimated. The Central African Republic has about 7,000 recent refugees, and more than 60,000 are already established in the Congo Republic.</p>
