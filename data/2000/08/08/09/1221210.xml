        <p>In just the last decade, stock options have gone from being icing on the cake in many executive pay packages to being the cake itself. The Internet revolution alone has created an army of overnight millionaires, and the number of Americans holding at least some options has soared to an estimated 10 million today from 1 million in 1992.</p>
        <p>Now, America's divorce courts are playing catch-up in trying to understand options as a compensation method. In recent years, judges in several states have taken a closer look at the wealth locked up in unexercised options and have made decisions that are aimed at awarding at least some of that wealth to the former spouses of the corporate managers who hold the options.</p>
        <p>Though the rulings address differing facets of the perplexing question of how to evaluate unexercised stock options, legal experts say they collectively reflect a social concern that is central in family law: the best interests of the children.</p>
        <p>Academics may have developed mathematical models for valuing unexercised options, notably the Black-Scholes method. But the recent court decisions are more about how to make sure ex-spouses share in the wealth generated by options than about how to value the options.</p>
        <p>The court decisions hold the potential for inflicting a great deal of financial pain on executives who thought the ordeal of their divorces was behind them. Consider the case of Richard John Kerr and his former wife, Deedee Jean Kerr. In 1996, the couple went to court in California for a permanent support hearing before the dissolution of their 20-year marriage. At the time, court documents show, Mrs. Kerr was a homemaker and Mr. Kerr was vice president of engineering at Qualcomm Inc., a wireless communications company in San Diego, with an annual salary of $159,735. Two of their four children lived at home.</p>
        <p>When they separated three years earlier, the couple, as required by California law, had agreed to an equal division of all their property. That included options in Qualcomm stock that Mr. Kerr had acquired but not yet exercised. In addition, Mr. Kerr had agreed to pay his former wife $3,309 a month in alimony and child support, based on his salary at that time of $110,427.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kerr, however, asked Judge Edward B. Huntington to increase the payments -- and after the hearing in 1996 he complied, raising them 45 percent, to $4,806. His reasoning, legal experts say, broke new ground. Stock options are a form of income, he ruled, and because the income that the Kerrs had received in past years by exercising Qualcomm options was a big factor in maintaining their standard of living, the calculation of alimony and child-support payments had to take into consideration the probable awarding and exercising of future stock options.</p>
        <p>Judge Huntington also ruled that Mrs. Kerr should receive 40 percent of all income that resulted from the future exercise of her ex-husband's options, until both children had reached the age of 18, and 25 percent after that. Mr. Kerr was free to exercise the options he currently held, as well as those awarded in the future, at any time. He also had an incentive not to exercise the options until the children reached 18. But if he declined to do so, legal experts say, his ex-wife could ask for support based on income that would be derived as if he had exercised the options.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerr appealed, saying the court abused its discretion and the award exceeded the needs of his ex-wife and children. But the couple negotiated a confidential settlement before a judge could issue an opinion.</p>
        <p>Even so, the ruling was the first in a string of court decisions in several states that are setting an important precedent in divorce law, legal experts say: proclaiming options to be a form of income, rather than a form of property.</p>
        <p>''The issue had been before the courts, but as best I know never decided,'' said George Norton, a California family-law specialist who has consulted and written extensively about options cases. ''In California, options are not property subject to division if they are 'earned' after separation. The logic then becomes they must be 'income' earned after separation and then subject to support awards. The concept is options can't be 'nothing' -- either property or income, but not nothing.''</p>
        <p>If options are property, most legal experts say, an ex-spouse has no future claim to them. But once they are considered income, they become eligible for alimony and child support awards. And those can be changed at any time.</p>
        <p>In Ohio last year, an appellate judge took the Kerr case a step further and ordered a Procter &amp; Gamble executive to make additional child support payments based on an amount of money equal to that which he would have paid had he exercised his stock options.</p>
        <p>When the executive, Graeme Murray, and his wife, Susan, divorced in 1994, she received half the options he held at the time. Three years later, she asked a magistrate's court to increase his child support payments because his income had increased to $325,743 from $212,702.</p>
        <p>The court then re-examined the way Mr. Murray's income had been computed and discovered that his salary, bonus, dividend and interest income and even taxable employee benefits had all been included, but not his stock options. After that court and a subsequent trial court ordered Mr. Murray to pay more, he appealed the decisions.</p>
        <p>In February 1999, an appeals court ruled that the value of Mr. Murray's unexercised options in Procter &amp; Gamble stock should be included in his gross income for the purposes of determining child support for his 16-year-old son. Since the P.&amp; G. options could be exercised a year after the grant date, the judge calculated the appreciation that would have occurred as if Mr. Murray had exercised the available options that year.</p>
        <p>For 1997 the appeals court valued the appreciation of the post-divorce options at $421,167. Excluding the options from the calculation, the court found, would allow an employee ''to shield a significant portion of his income and deprive his children of the standard of living they would otherwise enjoy.''</p>
        <p>Laurie K. Ahlers, Mr. Murray's lawyer, described the ruling as faulty because it would in effect force him to exercise his options. ''In my mind it takes away his ability to plan for his financial future,'' she said. ''With no other income, he would have no other choice.''</p>
        <p>But Judge Huntington, who ruled in the California case, said the decision made sense. ''I see it as a logical extension of Kerr,'' he said in an interview. ''Smart companies and industries can find creative ways to compensate employees and camouflage income as something other than income. Children and spouses are entitled to the fruits of those labors. Our job is to unmask the camouflage.''</p>
        <p>A court in Florida threw a sop to an ex-husband who suddenly found himself with a bigger support bill: if the underlying value of the stock options he held fell, the court might consider reducing the payments he had to make. The ex-husband, Albert Seither, was a Southwest Airlines pilot with annual income of more than $100,000 and 8,415 stock options that vested at a rate of 1,403 options a year on Sept. 1 of each year for five years beginning in 1998. The rest are to vest on Sept. 1, 2003.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seither's wife, Katherine, a part-time dental hygienist with a 17-year-old daughter at home, went to court in 1998 for a two-day final hearing on the dissolution of their marriage. After the hearing, the court found that Mrs. Seither had a need for $4,000 a month in permanent alimony, not the $600 she had been receiving, in addition to the $893 in child support to which Mr. Seither had agreed. Court documents indicated that he had apparently accepted the options in lieu of a salary increase. And an accountant who testified on Mrs. Seither's behalf said the theoretical value of the options justified the substantial increase.</p>
        <p>The court agreed. Like the courts in California and Ohio, it ruled that the options were income, not property. And it ordered Mr. Seither to pay alimony of $2,000 twice a month instead of the $600 monthly he had been paying, in addition to his existing child support.</p>
        <p>A state appellate court, while acknowledging a dual nature of options, upheld the judgment in December. But the appellate judge wrote, ''If the price of Southwest Airlines' stock falls significantly below the C.P.A.'s predictions, this change should be regarded as a potential ground for the modification of alimony.''</p>
        <p>In yet another wrinkle in the developing legal consensus on how to treat options in divorce, a Tennessee appellate court ruled in October that an increase in income from exercising yearly stock options as part of a bonus could be averaged and added to an employee's base salary in calculating child-support payments.</p>
        <p>The new terrain these courts are exploring has pitfalls, of course. Ms. Ahlers believes the Ohio court failed to grasp the nature of stock volatility. In March, after Proctor &amp; Gamble warned that it would not meet its earnings forecasts, the stock dropped from $89.87 a share on the grant anniversary date to $61.68 eight days later. ''Now he's overpaying,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In addition, some compensation specialists question whether the judiciary should be meddling in an area as arcane as options. The court-ordered exercise of options could harm an executive in a couple of ways, says James M. Crawford Jr., a benefits attorney in Davis, Calif. ''It could be construed by top management under certain circumstances as not being beneficial to the company,'' he said. Moreover, ''If the stock goes down, there's risk of loss if he's forced to exercise; if the stock goes up, then there's gain foregone.''</p>
        <p>With the specter of stock downturns, company attitudes toward stock options may be changing. Watson, Wyatt Worldwide, a consulting firm, tells clients that options are neither compensation nor benefits. ''They are a behavior-changing employee communication plan,'' said Carine Schneider, leader of global-stock-plan services at Watson, Wyatt. Even though options currently represent about $1 trillion in unexercised wealth nationally, she says, companies are letting employees know they are not entitled to this kind of compensation forever.</p>
