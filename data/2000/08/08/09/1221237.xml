        <p>NBC Internet, the online affiliate of the NBC television network, said yesterday that it would lay off 170 people, some 20 percent of its total work force of 850.</p>
        <p>About 100 employees were told yesterday they had been laid off, and the remaining positions will be eliminated by the end of the year, either through attrition, additional layoffs, or because certain units may be sold.</p>
        <p>NBCi, as the company is called, is a publicly traded company that is 39 percent owned by NBC, a unit of General Electric. Its shares have fallen by 85 percent this year. Yesterday, they closed unchanged at $11.</p>
        <p>With ad sales slowing and the markets less forgiving, the company decided to tighten its belt, said William J. Lansing, the chief executive.</p>
        <p>''In an easier-money time, you invest in business models that have returns down the road,'' he said. ''In the environment we are in today, the Street wants to see results now and you have to be very disciplined.''</p>
        <p>NBCi had expected to break even in the middle of 2002, but the layoffs and other cost-cutting will allow it to show profits sooner, Mr. Lansing said, though he declined to say when.</p>
        <p>''Our intent is not to lose money indefinitely,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the quarter ended June 30, NBCi lost $151.9 million on sales of $30.5 million. That loss was higher than analysts had expected because of a slowdown in ad revenue, especially from Internet companies.</p>
        <p>The company was formed last November as a result of the merger of Snap, an Internet portal site that NBC controlled, and Xoom, a publicly traded site that focused on direct marketing. The company also included several other operations that had been started by NBC as well as several acquisitions, including Allbusiness.com, a service aimed at small companies.</p>
        <p>''This business was formed through the merger of many businesses, and we have to now figure out how those pieces fit together,'' Mr. Lansing said.</p>
        <p>Two months ago, the company announced that it would eliminate Snap, Xoom and its other brand names and introduce a single new service this fall under the NBCi.com brand.</p>
        <p>The Internet units of other broadcast companies have also been cutting back. CBS's relatively small in-house Internet unit laid off several dozen people this summer. And the Walt Disney Internet Company, which runs the GO.com portal, is scaling back its ambition to focus on entertainment and travel.</p>
