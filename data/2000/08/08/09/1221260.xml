        <p>What has been a cruel summer for the Knicks and their general manager, Scott Layden, could become a nightmare as soon as today. While the Knicks battle the lowly Golden State Warriors for the rights to Danny Fortson, their most hated rival is on the verge of becoming the power team in the Eastern Conference.</p>
        <p>Pat Riley's Miami Heat is close to adding the coveted free agent Brian Grant to its reinvigorated roster, a move that makes the Heat the early favorite in the conference and leaves the Knicks feeling as though they have been left at the altar. After Grant Hill refused to pay the Knicks so much as a courtesy visit before committing to Orlando, Layden named Grant the club's most prized target.</p>
        <p>Now, after treating Grant to a yacht cruise and trying for a month to come up with an acceptable sign-and-trade deal, the Knicks may watch him sign with their fiercest playoff rival.</p>
        <p>A three-team trade that would send Grant to Miami, Shawn Kemp from the Cleveland Cavaliers to Portland and Chris Gatling and another Heat player or two to Cleveland is expected to be completed this week, perhaps even today. Coincidentally, dealing with Cleveland was how the Knicks had hoped to bring Grant to New York. If there is no trade, Grant is still expected to sign with Miami for the $2.5 million midlevel exception and look forward to a handsome raise next season when the Heat drops $10 million to $12 million below the salary cap.</p>
        <p>Until Grant's move to Miami becomes official, Layden does not want to consider the consequences. But if Grant joins Alonzo Mourning, Eddie Jones and Anthony Mason, few observers would pick the Knicks to eliminate the Heat from the playoffs for the fourth straight season.</p>
        <p>''I think maybe those questions are premature,'' Layden said yesterday. ''We'll have to wait and see how everything falls out and settles in. But I think Miami really did a remarkable job of improving their team with the Eddie Jones trade. There's no question about that. But we need to just focus on the Knicks and how we can get better.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks may be focused but there is little improvement to show for it. Besides the strange draft-night swap of John Wallace and Donnell Harvey to Dallas for Erick Strickland and Pete Mickeal, the Knicks have done nothing but re-sign the backup forward Kurt Thomas.</p>
        <p>It is hard to fault Layden, because he inherited a team that is virtually unchangeable. The Knicks are millions of dollars over the salary cap and have only a $2.25 million midlevel exception to offer free agents. That puts them in the bind of having to make outright trades or sign-and-trade deals. Making one of those is difficult, because the only players that teams find attractive are Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston, and wisely, the Knicks will only part with them if superstars are coming in return. Patrick Ewing will only accept a trade to a team that agrees to give him a two-year contract extension, a near impossibility since he is 38, injury riddled and in decline. Larry Johnson, for all his physical deterioration, has four years and $41.6 million left on his contract, making him anathema to other clubs. And Marcus Camby, who could have some value on the market, is scaring off teams because of his brittle knees.</p>
        <p>''Scott's worked hard, but I don't think people like our players,'' one member of the organization said on the condition of anonymity. ''The two guys they do like, we want to keep.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Miami has been the most innovative team of the summer. Last week, the Heat acquired Jones and Mason in a nine-player deal that cost it P. J. Brown and Jamal Mashburn. While the loss of Brown will hurt on the backboards, the acquisition of Jones gave the Heat a top-flight defender and great perimeter scorer to complement Mourning's inside dominance. The Heat's main problem last season was scoring points. With Jones and the hard-nosed and versatile Mason in the fold, that should no longer be an issue. And now, all that Miami lost in Brown will be returned if it acquires Grant.</p>
        <p>A person close to Grant who requested anonymity said yesterday that he had made his decision on where he will play. While he did not name a team, all indications are that it is the Heat. The only thing that would lessen the impact of Miami signing Grant would be if it had to send Mason to Cleveland in the sign-and-trade deal. That, however, is unlikely because it is doubtful that Cleveland would risk having Mason infect its young team with his rougish behavior.</p>
        <p>A lineup of Mourning, Mason, Grant, Jones and Tim Hardaway or Anthony Carter at point guard would be far and away the best defensive team in the East. And offensively, that group is a large improvement over last season's squad</p>
        <p>No one is saying that about the Knicks.</p>
