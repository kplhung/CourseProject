        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether PricewaterhouseCoopers, the auditing firm, acted properly in auditing the books of a real estate investment trust while it was helping the firm complete a number of acquisitions.</p>
        <p>Steven Day, the chief operating officer of Pinnacle Holdings, a company that leases space in communications towers to mobile telephone companies, said yesterday that PricewaterhouseCoopers, which he desribed as ''good partners,'' had helped analyze companies that Pinnacle had considered acquiring.</p>
        <p>''We use them to accumulate data, summarize it and give it to us to make decisions,'' he said during a conference call with analysts after the company reported quarterly earnings, which showed a slight slowing in growth. The company's stock fell $5.3125, to $37.8125.</p>
        <p>Pinnacle said that the S.E.C. had initially questioned how the company had accounted for one acquisition, but had then moved on to auditor independence questions. Mr. Day said the company was confident that its accounting was proper.</p>
        <p>Auditors are required to be independent from the companies whose books they audit. The S.E.C. is considering stronger rules, but this inquiry presumably focuses on whether current rules were violated.</p>
        <p>Dave Nestor, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ''We don't believe we have any independence issues with regard to Pinnacle. None of the consulting services we provided are prohibted under the S.E.C.'s independence rules.''</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. inquiry was disclosed in a prospectus Pinnacle filed to enable it to sell bonds as needed to finance acquisitions. It said the inquiry was preliminary. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.</p>
