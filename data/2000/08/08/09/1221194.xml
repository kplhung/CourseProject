        <p>When the mystical Lebanese writer Salim Moussa Achi died in 1984 at age 75, he left an eclectic legacy of unfashionable art and devoted disciples who told tales of his miraculous powers to ''cleanse'' leprosy or pluck a live bird from a painting.</p>
        <p>To true believers, he was a beloved prophet with some 2,500 ''spiritual revelations'' to his credit. He restored shattered crystal with a glance. He transformed losing lottery tickets into instant winners. And, as a young man, he cheated death by an Iranian firing squad by sacrificing one of six look-alike celestial personalities.</p>
        <p>Today, however, this globe-trotting collector's most visible achievement is a museum housed in a former nail salon, two floors below the Fine Art of Hair Replacement.</p>
        <p>At Fifth Avenue and 48th Street, the cramped gallery, papered in royal-blue damask, carries the name the collector preferred for himself, Dr. Dahesh. (The word means ''inspiring wonder'' or ''astounding'' in Arabic.) And the five-year-old Dahesh Museum is trying mightily to live up to its name by lifting itself from obscurity.</p>
        <p>Some city guidebooks label it a ''jewel box,'' and certainly it is one of New York's more unconventional museums. As it tries to distance itself from the spiritual roots of its founder (and his assorted personalities), the Dahesh Museum has amassed an endowment of more than $30 million, putting it in a class with art-world heavyweights like the Guggenheim Museum. It is also expanding its collection of 2,700 artworks and striving to stake out a more visible location with a bid to buy the former Hartford Gallery of Modern Art, a nine-story building at 2 Columbus Circle designed by Edward Durell Stone.</p>
        <p>Most exotic of all is its quaint practice from bygone days: It doesn't charge admission.</p>
        <p>The Dahesh Museum's mission is to shape a thoroughly mainstream and secular institution from its exotic beginnings as the whim of a passionate collector with a fondness for the supernatural and for the Rodney Dangerfields of high art.</p>
        <p>The museum's core is Dr. Dahesh's personal collection of more than 2,000 19th- and 20th-century academic paintings created by students and teachers under a rigid training system at European academies. These bucolic landscapes and historical scenes are rendered in a realistic style that for years was scorned and overshadowed by Impressionism.</p>
        <p>In much the same way, the new museum has faced scorn and suspicion because of the unconventional background of its founder, a self-taught art aficionado who dropped out of school at age 11. The museum strenuously distances itself from any religious connections, avoiding discussions of miracles and referring to Dr. Dahesh as a ''philosopher.''</p>
        <p>''We admire him as an art collector and a connoisseur and a person who had the foresight to see that this academic art had value,'' said the museum's director, John David Farmer, whose own early training incorporated disdain for the kind of academic paintings  he is now eager to buy at greatly increased prices. ''When I was in art school,'' he added, ''we didn't even look at this stuff.''</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the museum's cautious stance on its intellectual founder has stirred grumbling among Daheshist followers, who have no central organization to track their numbers, estimated by some devotees in the thousands.</p>
        <p>But there is really not much they can do beyond complaining that Dr. Dahesh's image has been air-brushed of religious overtones. That is because Dr. Dahesh's legal heirs, the members of the Zahid family, command the rights to shape his legacy through ownership of his artworks, book collection and the copyrights to his writings.</p>
        <p>''I could care less about all the materialistic things, like the art and museum and books,'' said one Daheshist, Mounir Murad, owner of a Virginia electronic-imaging company and author of a self-published book, ''Daheshism and the Journey of Life.'' ''My main concern is that there is a spiritual mission, and they've been shoving it under a carpet. Anything that would tie the museum to a spiritual mission is taboo.''</p>
        <p>The Zahids, a wealthy Saudi family with severed roots in Lebanon, inherited 2,000 artworks when Dr. Dahesh died in Greenwich, Conn., where the Zahids live. Longtime friends of Dr. Dahesh, the Zahids helped move the collection out of Lebanon during the civil war in 1975. Later they established the museum and nurtured a separate publishing company in Manhattan to produce and distribute Dr. Dahesh's writings. The museum says that a few of the paintings are still pocked from bullets that struck them while they were hanging in Dr. Dahesh's cluttered Beirut home, which functioned as a private salon.</p>
        <p>Amira Zahid, a lawyer and one of five Zahid relatives who serve on the Dahesh Museum's seven-member board, said that as a girl she recalled sitting in the salon and listening to the conversations of Dr. Dahesh and his supporters. She said that Dr. Dahesh had wanted to create a museum in Lebanon. But when the family members inherited his estate years later, they preferred Manhattan because ''New York is a challenge, and if we can make it in New York City we can make it everywhere,'' she said. ''We are very serious about this.''</p>
        <p>With the multimillion-dollar inheritance from Dr. Dahesh, Ms. Zahid said that her mother, Mervat, proposed to her the idea of starting a museum with little more direction than, ''You figure it out.'' The Dahesh Museum was incorporated in 1987 and formally opened in January 1995 with that seed money, the younger Ms. Zahid said.</p>
        <p>The endowment has grown from $6.4 million in 1989 to more than $30 million in stock investments, which have increased over the years with regular contributions from Zahid family members. Last year alone, Amira Zahid donated $59,000 in cash and stocks valued at more than $2 million. The Zahids have also been active in acquiring new works for the museum, participating and bidding in auctions.</p>
        <p>The endowment has helped nurture the Dahesh Museum's ambitions. Currently, with just 2,500 square feet of gallery space, the museum can offer only condensed exhibitions of Dr. Dahesh's collections of works by artists like Rosa Bonheur and Adolphe William Bouguereau, or loan exhibitions like its current one, ''In the Footsteps of Goethe.''</p>
        <p>But the museum is determined to break out of its confines. In May it submitted a second, sweetened bid for the former Hartford Gallery building. Its earlier bid was rejected, as was a proposal from the developer Donald Trump, apparently because the amount, which the museum declined to disclose, was deemed unsatisfactory. An official with the Economic Development Commission said that the Dahesh Museum's second bid was still under review.</p>
        <p>With a successful bid, the museum predicts that it could reopen in about 18 months at Columbus Circle, which would have a sizable impact on its annual attendance of about 20,000 people.</p>
        <p>''It's a museum with enormous potential that can't be realized because it's ridiculously small,'' said Robert Rosenblum, a professor of fine arts at New York University and a curator of the Guggenheim exhibition ''1900: Art at the Crossroads.'' ''Everything depends on what's going to happen. If they're still cramped in this little space, they can't do much.''</p>
        <p>''They have an exceptional director and an excellent staff,'' he said. ''Their background is a little bit like the problem of lots of other museums that have transcended the character of their founders. When you think of Albert C. Barnes and the Barnes Foundation -- he was a total lunatic. But with the money coming in, the personality of the founder is something that essentially gets buried, and what's relevant is the potential of the place.''</p>
        <p>The Dahesh Museum is one of very few institutions in the United States that exclusively promote 19th-century academic art. Polly Sartori, who oversees 19th-century paintings at Sotheby's in New York, said that the museum had also reassured collectors about the value of such works. ''Collectors are very aware that when they go into major museums that most of the space is devoted to Impressionist paintings,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dahesh started collecting art in the 1930's, well before he faced persecution by the Lebanese authorities and temporary exile in 1944 for his religious beliefs. The key tenet of Daheshism is the universality of major religions and their embrace of the same core teachings and the same God. Miracles, Dr. Dahesh told some of his followers and his biographer, Salim Onbargi, ''strengthen the bond of faith and belief in God.''</p>
        <p>No one is quite sure why Dr. Dahesh bought academic paintings, but the works were certainly more affordable than the Impressionist paintings that his friends said he also relished. Academic paintings sold for as little as $275 in the 1940's.</p>
        <p>Followers like Fares Zaatar, who is completing a book about Dr. Dahesh, said that the collector amassed his acquisitions with help from supporters and earnings from the sales of his own books. The books, which offer spiritual lessons, include a 20-volume series about the global wanderings he undertook after he left Lebanon permanently in 1976.</p>
        <p>''His extraordinary spiritual power enabled him to discern the great art,'' said Ghazi Brax, the editor of Dahesh Voice, a magazine for followers. ''He was a genuine connoisseur. He believed in the power of great art in sublimating the instinctive drives and enhancing spiritual awakening.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brax described the Zahid family as some of Dr. Dahesh's ''favorite followers.'' His magazine is published by the Daheshist Publishing Company, whose president is listed as Amira Zahid's mother, Mervat.</p>
        <p>But Amira Zahid is so careful about building a wall between the museum and religion that she declined to say whether she was a Daheshist. Mr. Farmer, the director of the museum, added that since the founding of the Dahesh Museum, the family had never espoused any religious views.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't speak for my family,'' Ms. Zahid said. ''I can only speak for myself. I have my own personal beliefs, but I don't think this is the forum to talk about it.''</p>
        <p>At the museum, nursing coffee from a cup emblazoned with Jules Breton's sketch ''Le Gouter,'' she expressed frustration that the family had been scrutinized for years as if they were almost ''criminals'' because of suspicions about their motives.</p>
        <p>''Dahesh is a person with many gifts, and so people can take from them what they want,'' Ms. Zahid  said. ''We're lucky to have known him, and this collection really is a gift from him to the city of New York.''</p>
        <p>''We are here to promote nothing but art,'' she said, adding, ''Why can't we just accept the museum for what it is?''</p>
