        <p>Following are excerpts from the announcement yesterday by Vice President Al Gore that he had named Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate, as recorded by The New York Times. Also speaking in an appearance at a Nashville war memorial were Mr. Gore's wife, Tipper, Senator Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, and Senator Lieberman.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gore</p>
        <p>You all know what an extraordinary person Senator Joe Lieberman is, and I want you to know another very extraordinary person, a person who represents the very best of America, my friend Hadassah. Let me tell you something. . . .</p>
        <p>We were talking last night about the fact that we graduated the same year from the same class at Boston University. I know. And I have admired her, and we have been friends for 15 years.</p>
        <p>I want you to know something about her: her mother is a survivor of Auschwitz and Dachau. Her father was in Nazi labor camps, and organized an escape of Jewish men. And after the war was over, he helped organize and nurture Jewish orphans.</p>
        <p>Hadassah is here. Hadassah was born to this extraordinary couple in Czechoslovakia. When she was 3 years old, her father took the family, escaped Stalin's repression and immigrated to America. To me she's not only a friend, but she represents what America is all about.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lieberman</p>
        <p>We are thrilled and very, very deeply moved and honored today to be in the great State of Tennessee with our dear beloved friends, Al and Tipper. When Tipper told me that she was going to talk a bit, just mention my background today, and here I am in this place that commemorates World War II, wars of veterans, and here I am the daughter of survivors from the Holocaust, the most horrendous thing that happened, and here I am in the place that commemorates the American heroes, the soldiers who actually liberated my mother in Dachau and in Auschwitz. So I stand before you very deeply, sincerely thankful that I am an American, grateful that we have such a wonderful, wonderful family in the Gores, and that they've made this bold, wonderful choice to help us be part of the ticket that's going to win.</p>
        <p>Let me end now with just this one statement, and I say this to all of you here and all of you who are watching this on television, and this is real: Whether you and your family immigrated from Europe, Africa, Mexico, Latin America or Asia, I am standing here for you. This person is our country. This land is your land and anything is possible for us.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore</p>
        <p>With pride in his achievements, with gratitude for his acceptance of this challenge and with faith in his fight for working families, I'm here to announce my running mate, the next vice president of the United States, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Tipper and I and our family, including my mother, are thrilled to welcome Joe and Hadassah and their family, including Joe's mother. And I say to all of you now, together, we're going to take this ticket from Nashville, Tenn., today to Los Angeles, Calif., next week, and then all the way across America to the White House in November.</p>
        <p>When I set out to choose a running mate, I said from the start that I had three simple tests: First, and most importantly, I wanted someone who had the experience, the character and the judgment to become president on a moment's notice should that ever become necessary.</p>
        <p>Second, I wanted someone who could work with me as a partner, someone who shares my values and believes in the promise of America, as I do. And third, I wanted someone who would fight, right alongside me, for the people, not the powerful. For you. Joe Lieberman has the experience and the integrity. He has the courage and the commitment. And for all his public life, Joe Lieberman has stood for working families.</p>
        <p>He's the right person. No one is better prepared to be vice president of the United States of America. As attorney general of Connecticut, he took on the big polluters to clean up toxic waste. He believes, as I do, that every family has a right to clean air and clean water.</p>
        <p>He believes, as I do, that the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.</p>
        <p>Joe Lieberman has stood up to the big oil companies and cracked down on price gouging at the gas pumps. He believes, as I do, in an America that frees itself forever from the dominance of big oil and foreign oil.</p>
        <p>I've known Joe Lieberman for 15 years now. We have stood together again and again for policies and principles to bring a new time of prosperity and progress.</p>
        <p>Together we fought for welfare reform, to set time limits and make welfare a second chance and not a way of life. And the welfare rolls have been cut in half, with people moving into good jobs.</p>
        <p>Together we fought for fiscal discipline, for balanced budgets based on hard numbers and tough choices.</p>
        <p>And in the Gore-Lieberman administration, we will put this nation on the road to completely eliminating our national debt, to keep the prosperity and progress going.</p>
        <p>Together we fought to make our communities safe again. We're putting 100,000 new community police on our streets, and we've seen crime rates fall seven years in a row.</p>
        <p>In our administration, we're going to pass a crime victims' bill of rights, including a constitutional amendment to make sure that victims, and not just criminals, have guaranteed rights in our justice system.</p>
        <p>Together we fought to provide health care for children in need and to make sure that families don't lose health insurance when a parent loses a job or changes jobs.</p>
        <p>And in the Gore-Lieberman administration, we're going to pass a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program for all of our seniors. And we're going to pass a real patients' bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the accountants and give them back to the doctors and the nurses and the health care professionals.</p>
        <p>And we're going to move step by step toward health care for all our families, starting with every child by the year 2004.</p>
        <p>Joe Lieberman and I have fought together for campaign finance reform. And that will be the very first bill of the Gore-Lieberman administration. And together, Joe Lieberman and I have always stood for a strong national defense.</p>
        <p>He and I broke with our own party to cast two lonely Democratic votes in support of the Persian Gulf war. . . .</p>
        <p>Joe and I come from different regions and different religious faiths.</p>
        <p>But we believe in a common set of ideals. And we both believe with our whole resolve, that as Americans, we must make real the great ideal that we are one country with a common destiny.</p>
        <p>Next week, when our party meets in Los Angeles, we will recall the last time we met there, at the convention where we nominated John F. Kennedy. That year, we voted with our hearts to make history by tearing down an old wall of division.</p>
        <p>And when we nominate Joe Lieberman for vice president, we will make history again. We will tear down an old wall of division once again.</p>
        <p>When he sought the presidency more than 30 years ago, Robert Kennedy summoned us to make new the life of the world. That year, Robert Kennedy's Connecticut campaign chair was a young man of purpose and character, a young man who had dedicated himself to social justice and working families.</p>
        <p>Earlier, when he was in college, that young man traveled here to the South, a year before freedom summer, when great fights for civil rights were being fought and won, to help register African-Americans to vote.</p>
        <p>Before he went, that young man wrote these words: ''I am going because there is much work to be done. I am an American, and this is one nation or it is nothing.''</p>
        <p>That young man's name was Joe Lieberman, and as I stand next to him today, I believe in my heart that we are one step closer to truly being one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>
        <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the next vice president of the United States of America, Joe Lieberman.</p>
        <p>Senator Lieberman</p>
        <p>Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your confidence, for your courage, for your great words. I am humbled and honored and excited to be here in Nashville today.</p>
        <p>I am proud to stand by your side and ready to use every ounce of strength and capacity that the good Lord has given me to make you the next great president of the United States.</p>
        <p>Dear friends, I am so full of gratitude at this moment. I ask you to allow me to let the spirit move me, as it does, to remember the words from Chronicles, which are to give thanks to God, to give thanks to God and declare his name and make his acts known to the people; to be glad of spirit; to sing to God and make music to God, and most of all, to give glory and gratitude to God from whom all blessings truly do flow.</p>
        <p>Dear Lord, maker of all miracles, I thank you for bringing me to this extraordinary moment in my life.</p>
        <p>And Al Gore, I thank you for making this miracle possible for me and breaking this barrier for the rest of America forever. God bless you and thank you. . . .</p>
        <p>Now, my friends, I stand here today with a proud, simple, but I think very important message: Al Gore of Tennessee is the best man to lead America into the new century, and I know you agree with me. And America agrees with us, too. Al and I have been friends for almost 15 years now, personal friends.</p>
        <p>And I can tell you that before the nation knew Al Gore as a vice president, I knew him as a man of family and a man of faith. There is nothing, absolutely nothing more important to Al Gore in this world than the strength of his family and the love and devotion he has for his wonderful children.</p>
        <p>I can tell you the times, the many times, he moved meetings or rearranged his schedule to attend his children's sporting events or to be home when one of his daughters called from school. He has never, never wavered in his responsibilities as a father, as a husband and, yes, as a servant of God Almighty. Those are qualities that make him a great man and will make him the next great president of the United States of America.</p>
        <p>Now, my friends, leadership is not just a word. It means something. It requires courage, it requires character. And I can stand here today and say to you from personal experience that Al Gore has both. He has proven time and time again by volunteering to serve his country in Vietnam, by honoring the legacy of his father with 14 remarkable years in the United State Congress, by compiling the most accomplished and successful record of leadership of any vice president in the history of this great country. That record, my friends, speak for itself.</p>
        <p>Forty years ago, when I was 18 years old, I remember so clearly watching in awe as John F. Kennedy, the inspiration and hero of my political life, became the first Roman Catholic president of the United States. To me that election said so much to me about the courage and the character and the fairness of the American people. And I want to say to you today that choosing me as his running mate says the same thing about the courage and character and fairness of Al Gore of Tennessee.</p>
        <p>You know, there are some people who might actually call Al's selection of me an act of chutzpah. I cannot express with words the gratitude that I feel in my heart today as the first Jewish-American to be honored to be a major party candidate for the vice presidency of this blessed United States of America.</p>
        <p>But let's be very clear about this. It isn't me, Joe Lieberman, who deserves the credit and the congratulations for taking a bold step. It is Al Gore who broke this barrier in American history. That's right. And you know what it shows? It shows Al's faith in the tolerance of this diverse nation, in the basic fairness of the American people. And I want to say to the people of America, Al Gore trusts you, which is one good reason for you to place your trust in him as the next great president of the United States.</p>
        <p>You know, yesterday, the day that the vice president asked me to be his running mate, was, to put it mildly, a miraculous day. Remember that old Beatles line, ''a magical mystery tour''? I felt I was on a magical mystery tour yesterday. I had some just memorable conversations. And one of the most memorable of them was with the Rev. Jesse Jackson. He said something to me that went to my heart and I hope it will to yours as well. He said to me, ''You know, Joe, each time a barrier falls for one person the doors of opportunity open wider for every other American.''</p>
        <p>I think we can say with certainty here in Nashville today that the American dream is alive and it is well. You might almost say that you could call this ticket the American dream team.</p>
        <p>Now eight years ago, the American dream was not alive and well. Remember? And what strikes me as incredible is that today the same people who let this nation drift are trying to convince us that the last eight years have been squandered. Can you believe it? They must go is right. It's unbelievable. I'll tell you this, if you're one of the 22 million people in our country who got a new job during the last eight years, you know that the last eight years were not squandered.</p>
        <p>And if you're one of the 15 million parents in our country who got time off from work to care for a child, you know that the last eight years have not been squandered. And if you are one of the millions and millions of families who were able to buy a new home because this Democratic administration turned their deficits into surpluses, you know the last eight years were not squandered. The American people know from their own lives, not from the happy talk coming out of Philadelphia a week or so ago, that these last eight years have, as the vice president has said, been years of progress and prosperity.</p>
        <p>We still have a long way to go. And the question before us today, as we begin the drive for the White House, is this: Are we going to elect the old guard that created the problems or a new guard that will continue to work to solve America's problems and make this a better, safer, more secure country? Well, I appreciate that answer, because that's my answer to that question, too.</p>
        <p>Al Gore -- this is no contest -- Al Gore is without a doubt the most qualified person to be president of the United States. I can tell you, for the last eight years he has served as a full partner in this administration helping to shape this country's economic policy, its social policy, its strong foreign and defense policy and it's fight for America's working middle-class families. . . .</p>
        <p>Yes, there's a lot at stake in this election and, as I say, the real differences between the two parties. And we're going to talk about those differences from this day on. It's a choice, again, as all elections are, about whether we want to go forward or whether we want to go backward. For me, for my family, that's an easy question to answer.</p>
        <p>And frankly, the answer comes from our history. My dad came out of high school during the Depression. He never had the chance to go to college. His first job was on a bakery truck. He'd get on it at night in New Haven, he'd ride it down to the bakery in Bridgeport, he'd work all night in the bakery and then ride the truck back as it made its stops delivering the baked goods, finally dropping him off at home, where he slept a few hours and back to work that night.</p>
        <p>I've got to tell you that later in my life, sometimes even in political campaigns or even in my work in government, when I felt like we'd been working hard, I would think back to my dad's labor and my dad's example and the long hours he put in literally working from 9 to 9. He worked so very hard to send my two sisters and me to college, and he gave us a chance to become our hopes and our dreams. And that is what the American dream is all about.</p>
        <p>I tell you, my friends, that somewhere in America right now, and probably many in this crowd today, there are another father or mother working just as hard to give their children a better life. And I tell you today that they deserve a leader who hears their voice, they deserve to have a government that is on their side, they deserve to have a president who will stand up for them, they deserve the leadership of Al Gore of Tennessee.</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN  Correction:  August 10, 2000, Thursday  A front-page article yesterday about Vice President Al Gore's introduction of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in Nashville as the first Jewish candidate on a major national party ticket referred incorrectly to Mr. Gore's comparison to John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was the first Catholic elected president; the first one nominated was Gov. Alfred E. Smith of New York, the Democratic candidate in 1928.</p>
