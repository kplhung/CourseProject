        <p>AT Georg Breuer, a leading wine estate in this small town on the Rhine, I tasted three bottles of Rudesheim Berg Schlossberg, 1998, '97 and '90 vintages. Each had aromas that were almost floral, and each was powerfully dry. The youngest was almost mouth-puckering, but with age, the wines seemed to mellow, emphasizing their extraordinary balance.</p>
        <p>Dry is hardly the description most Americans imagine when they think of German wines. The images that arise are sugary liebfraumilch, which was once a popular beginner's wine; fruity, vibrant rieslings; and powerful trockenbeerenausleses, some of the world's grandest (and most unpronounceable) dessert wines.</p>
        <p>Yet, what do the Germans themselves drink? Dry wines. Occasionally, the wines are as exquisite as the Breuers. But as I found on visits to almost two dozen wineries in the Rhine and Mosel valleys, they are more often not simply dry, but so parching that they seem to drain the mouth of every last bit of moisture. These wines are often labeled ''halbtrocken'' and ''trocken,'' which translates literally as ''half dry'' and ''dry,'' but more accurately as ''dry'' and ''very dry.'' And now, as the German wine industry ponders how to make its product more appealing to Americans, many see dry wines as their salvation, as a way to get in step with a world that may not know a lot about white wines but wants them to be called dry.</p>
        <p>It's not merely a debate, but an identity crisis within a wine industry in which everything seems to be open to challenge, from the tortured methods for assessing the quality of German vineyards and the Byzantine labeling laws to the recent history of German winemaking itself. And inevitably, statesmanlike solutions for improving and simplifying German wine rules fall prey to politics, which pits region against region and artisanal winemakers against industrial producers.</p>
        <p>The economic stakes are high. Through the 1990's, the United States imported about 10 million liters of wine from Germany annually, way down from a high figure of about 60 million in 1984, according to the German Wine Information Bureau in New York. Most of that difference came from big German producers of sweet and cheap wines, whose popularity nose-dived along with that of most American jug wines in the last 15 years. But these producers want to get back into the American market, and they see dry wines as their best bet.</p>
        <p>''They say, 'Italy had the same problem with Riunite and lambrusco, and they came out with pinot grigio,' '' said Johannes Selbach, whose winery, Selbach-Oster, in Zeltingen on the Mosel River, produces both fruity and dry wines. ''But we Germans should not forget that there is a strong Italian restaurant scene and market in the U.S., and they haven't had the problems with World War I and World War II. That's a strategic disadvantage for Germany that you cannot change with a change in style.''</p>
        <p>Backers of the trockens point not only to the worldwide market for dry wines, but also to their popularity in Germany, where trockens and dry Italian wines like pinot grigio are still popular.</p>
        <p>''The 80's saw a boom in dry wines and a complete falling off of the sweet wines,'' Mr. Selbach said. ''The trockens exploded, and drinking anything but trockens was considered politically incorrect.''</p>
        <p>Some say that the German embrace of dry wines is really a return to the way German wines were made a century ago, before technology allowed winemakers to control fermentation precisely. By this argument, today's dry wines have a greater claim to authenticity than the fruity style most people think of as traditional.</p>
        <p>''People can misconstrue the move to a dry style as a move away from the traditional German style, but I don't think that's true,'' said Stephen H. Metzler of Classical Wines in Seattle, which imports Breuer and other dry rieslings into the United States.</p>
        <p>Because of climate, soil and other conditions, some areas in Germany, like the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, were always more suited to making fruity wines than dry wines, Mr. Metzler concedes. But he says that in areas like the Rheingau 90 to 95 percent of all wines made 100 years ago were bone dry. ''This is the way wines were made until technology gave winemakers more methods of manipulation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Others regard this as historical revisionism and wishful thinking.</p>
        <p>''The Germans were losing market share to dry Italian wines in the late 1970's and said, 'Why can't we make these wines?' '' said Terry Thiese, a leading American importer of German wines. ''First, they wanted to sell more wines. Then, they came up with historical, religious and health-oriented justifications.''</p>
        <p>Either way, the salient fact about the trocken wines is that most Americans are not used to wines so dry and acidic. And yet, many restaurants in Germany offer little besides trocken wines, because that is what Germans say they want.</p>
        <p>''I refuse to believe that human beings can enjoy shrill, sour, ugly, dry wines,'' said Mr. Thiese, who estimates that trockens make up 20 percent of his sales in the United States. ''I have to believe that the German market's embrace of these wines has nothing to do with taste and everything to do with fashion.''</p>
        <p>Supporters of the dry wines, like Armin Goring, director of the German Wine Institute, which promotes German wines at home and abroad, assert that they are better matches with food than fruity wines. Others argue for a diversity of wines, especially in a country with a wide range of cuisines like the United States.</p>
        <p>''There's a place for trocken wines, and there's a place for fruity wines, and it depends on what comes out of the kitchen,'' said Rudi Wiest, another leading American importer of German wines. ''I think they're illiterate when it comes to wine and food pairings over there. They don't have the plethora of styles of food that we have over here. This pushing of all dry wines, they're barking up the wrong tree. Even American wines are not bone dry.''</p>
        <p>Nor are the best dry German rieslings, which are rare because they are very hard to make.</p>
        <p>''I defy anyone to sit with a glass of well-made trocken riesling and say anything negative, but you have to taste through hundreds of them to find anyone who knows how to do them,'' said Willie Gluckstern, a wine-and-food consultant, author and passionate proponent of German rieslings, dry and fruity.</p>
        <p>The glory of German riesling rests on a teetering balance of acidity, alcohol and sweetness. When ripe grapes are picked, their juice is full of sugar. When they ferment, the sugar is converted to alcohol. If the fermentation stops before all the sugar is converted, that residual sugar will sweeten the wine, which will have less alcohol. If all the sugar is converted to alcohol, the wine will be completely dry and more powerful.</p>
        <p>The wild card is acidity. Some residual sugar must remain to balance the tartness of riesling's naturally high acidity. Yet, if the residual sugar rises above 9 grams to a liter, by German law the wine can no longer be branded with the magic word ''trocken.'' It must be called halbtrocken if it has up to 18 grams of residual sugar, though these wines may still taste bone dry because of their high acidity.</p>
        <p>The tangle of German wine laws presents problems to importers, who recognize the American wine market's aversion to anything but white wines labeled dry. Mr. Gluckstern, for one, plans to bring in good-quality German wines to sell for under $10, but the trocken-halbtrocken issue is nettlesome.</p>
        <p>''You don't have to go that dry to make a German white wine that will appeal to Americans,'' he said. ''The problem with halbtrocken, though, is if I write 'half dry,' it's a death knell. It means it's sweet.''</p>
        <p>That's not the only issue. Almost everyone agrees that even traditional German wine terminology is now so arcane as to produce meaningless labels. Terms like ''kabinett,'' ''spatlese'' and ''auslese'' were meant to indicate how ripe the grapes were when they were picked, and therefore to convey how sweet a wine would be. But when wines are made in a dry style, the sugar content in grapes at harvest tells little about the wine in the bottle. Similarly, terms like ''trocken'' and ''halbtrocken'' indicate how much sugar is left in the wine after it is made, but the words do not take acidity into account, again offering little clue to the wine's flavor.</p>
        <p>''Selling beautiful German wines within their wine laws is like taking a hike through the most beautiful scenery with a 75-pound pack on your back,'' Mr. Thiese said. ''You say, 'I wish I didn't have to carry this weight,' but you're still blown away by the beauty.''</p>
        <p>Just as some of the greatest Italian wines can be called only vino da tavola, because they do not adhere to Italian wine rules, some leading German wine producers like Georg Breuer are choosing not to play the labeling game, eliminating potentially prestigious terminology like ''kabinett'' and ''spatlese'' in favor of simple vineyard sites.</p>
        <p>''This is the style of my wines,'' Bernhard Breuer said. ''If we use terms like 'kabinett' and 'spatlese,' it implies that there are other sweetness levels.''</p>
        <p>Actually, Mr. Breuer does use terms like ''auslese,'' ''beerenauslese'' and ''eiswein'' to describe his ultrasweet wines, which he makes in small quantities, but not his dry wines.</p>
        <p>''We don't believe in trocken wines,'' said Mr. Breuer's importer, Mr. Metzler. ''We believe in well-balanced flavorful wines. 'Trocken' has come to mean mediocre wines, in which the sweetness has been taken out, exposing its mediocrity.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 10, 2000, Thursday  An article yesterday about a new emphasis on dry wines in Germany for shipment to the United States misspelled the name of an importer. He is Terry Theise, not Thiese.</p>
