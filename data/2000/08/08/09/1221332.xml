        <p>Putting the blame for a February nuclear accident squarely on Consolidated Edison, Gov. George E. Pataki signed a bill today requiring the company to repay customers more than $100 million collected to pay expenses from the accident and prohibiting it from collecting tens of millions more.</p>
        <p>The governor's decision to sign the bill, which could cost the utility about $200 million, stunned nearly everyone involved in the dispute, and came after attempts by the Pataki administration to reach a negotiated settlement with the company had failed.</p>
        <p>It is by far the largest rate rollback the state has ever imposed on a utility for its own misdeeds, more than double the previous record of $82 million, in a case against Con Edison in the early 1980's. The governor's office said that for the average residential customer, it would mean a $14 credit in New York City, and $21 in Westchester County. The administration plans to order the credits on September electric bills.</p>
        <p>But Con Edison promised to sue the state to void the law. ''In passing unlawful legislation, the state sends a message to all of its citizens and corporations that politics overrides sound public policy,'' said Joseph P. Petta, a company spokesman. ''We are confident that the court will recognize that this bill is unconstitutional.'' Company officials would not say on what grounds they planned to mount a legal challenge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki signed the bill on the last day he had to act on it, after weeks of talks between Con Edison and the state's Public Service Commission, which is appointed and controlled by the governor. In recent days, the commission and Con Edison were said to be near agreement on a deal for the utility to give back up to $55 million, and possibly as little as $40 million, but the details could not be worked out, according to several people who were involved in the dispute.</p>
        <p>Such a deal would have been assailed by Con Edison's critics, including many elected officials, as grossly inadequate recompense. But it would have given Mr. Pataki some political cover if he had been inclined to veto the bill, which he had serious reservations about.</p>
        <p>''This bill was the only mechanism for immediate, meaningful rate relief, for putting money back in people's pockets,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, the Westchester County Democrat who played a leading role in attacking Con Edison and demanding redress.</p>
        <p>The bill reached the governor's desk at the height of summer power demand, and at a time when rates have spiked because of power shortages around the Northeast. New York and other states are breaking up the old utility monopolies, forcing companies like Con Edison to sell most of their power plants and buy power on the open market, subjecting them to price fluctuations as supply and demand vary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has sought repeatedly, through tax cuts, regulatory mandates and other steps, to lower the price of electricity in New York, which has some of the nation's highest rates. But Democrats and some consumer advocates have attributed the recent price increases to his administration's handling of restructuring, and Mr. Pataki's decision to sign the bill could help mute such complaints.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 15, cracked pipes in a steam generator allowed a small amount of radioactive gas to escape from the Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor alongside the Hudson River in Buchanan, 35 miles north of Manhattan. The accident forced Con Edison to shut down the plant, and it is likely to remain closed for months, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission having rejected the company's repair plans as insufficient.</p>
        <p>Con Edison had known for years that the plant's generators were faulty. In fact, the company and several other utilities sued the generators' manufacturer, Westinghouse, and won, forcing Westinghouse to provide replacement generators that were delivered in 1988. Every other plaintiff installed the new generators, but Con Edison made the decision that it would be cheaper to make do for as long as possible with the original, defective ones.</p>
        <p>''Con Ed must be held accountable for its failures,'' Mr. Pataki said in a statement today. ''While I would normally take a dim view of this type of legislation, this is an extraordinary case that requires strong and immediate action.''</p>
        <p>The Public Service Commission lobbied against the bill, viewing it as punitive and possibly illegal, and even some administration officials had predicted that the governor would veto it.</p>
        <p>In addition, the bill highlighted a running turf battle between Mr. Pataki and the Democratic majority in the Assembly. The governor has made it clear that he considers regulation of utilities a matter for the administration, particularly the Public Service Commission, and not for the Legislature. He has beaten back repeated attempts by the Democrats to claim a role for the Legislature in dictating how the restructuring of the power industry should be managed.</p>
        <p>Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the sponsor of the bill, said Mr. Pataki signed the bill because ''he didn't want to take the heat, politically,'' for failing to hold Con Edison responsible for its actions. The bill, he said, would ''send a clear message to Con Ed that you're going to protect the consumers'' and not just the company's stockholders.</p>
        <p>To make up for the power normally supplied by Indian Point, the company has had to buy power from other sources, or run its other plants more of the time. Under state law, Con Edison was able to pass on the cost of that ''replacement power'' to its customers without approval by the Public Service Commission.</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Brodsky's estimates, the cost of the power has added $110 million to Con Edison customers' bills, The governor's office put the cost at $162 million. Con Edison officials would not cite a figure, but said the governor's was much too high.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Pataki's signature on the bill stops the collection of the higher charges, which would have continued until the reopening of the plant, an event that could be several months away.</p>
        <p>The governor estimated that the halt would save customers an additional $60 million on future bills, bringing the new law's total cost to Con Edison to $222 million. The Assembly Democrats said the total would probably be a bit under $200 million. It will be left up to the Public Service Commission to determine the exact figures.</p>
        <p>The signing culminates a five-month campaign by Con Edison's critics, particularly the Assembly Democrats, to penalize the company -- a campaign that included public hearings, numerous news conferences and complex legal maneuvering before the Public Service Commission.</p>
        <p>In March, Mr. Brodsky and Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat of the Bronx filed a complaint with the Public Service Commission, claiming that the costs were due to Con Edison's own actions and should be disallowed. They were later joined by Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, Westchester County and some consumer groups. It was in the context of that complaint that the commission was negotiating with Con Edison.</p>
        <p>The complaint, which is still technically under consideration, goes significantly further than the law Mr. Pataki signed today; it seeks to disallow, among other charges, fuel costs Con Edison incurred any time over the last decade that it had to service the old generators. If approved by the commission, that requirement could force another $100 million in rebates.</p>
