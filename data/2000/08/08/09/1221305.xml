        <p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is on rent strike. It stopped paying rent on its office space at 2 Broadway, claiming in a lawsuit that its landlord defaulted on his promise to renovate the building.</p>
        <p>The landlord has countersued, claiming that the price to renovate the building soared after the authority shifted some of its own responsibility to build the interior spaces onto his contractors, who are upgrading the building's infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Observers say that the dispute really arose when the M.T.A.'s unrealistic expectations rubbed up against the building management's inexperience at handling commercial renovations.</p>
        <p>It has all escalated to the point where there are now five lawsuits in New York courts, and the landlord, an immigrant from the former Soviet Union whose first job in New York was driving a cab, has been barred from setting foot in his own building.</p>
        <p>The landlord, Tamir Sapir, has come a long way since he was cruising for fares. He told his side of the story over a nine-course meal on his 156-foot motor yacht, Mystere, which was anchored 200 yards from the dock at his 11-acre estate in Kings Point, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The $350,000 Cartier watch on Mr. Sapir's wrist flashed as he condemned what he said was the authority's brass-knuckle negotiating over 2 Broadway, his 32-story, 1.6-million-square-foot building in Lower Manhattan, opposite Bowling Green.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sapir contends in a lawsuit that the estimated bill for renovations has more than tripled to $156 million as the authority has inflated bills and shifted some of its own costs to his account. He charged in an affidavit that the authority refused to pay more than $10 million in rent in a ploy to force him into foreclosure so that it could buy the building at a low price.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sapir said he had not stepped inside 2 Broadway for more than 17 months, ever since the authority, his sole tenant there, barred him from entering without its permission.</p>
        <p>''I love that building,'' said Mr. Sapir, speaking in a strong Georgian accent. ''But what should have cost $39 million has cost $156 million, and I can't even go in there.''</p>
        <p>At one point, Mr. Sapir said, he and his lenders were so desperate to resolve the situation that they hired Alfonse M. D'Amato, the former senator, to talk to the transportation authority to bring an end to the warfare. Nothing worked.</p>
        <p>The authority has declined to comment on the case, citing the lawsuits. Its lawyers have complained in court about clogged pipes and backed-up toilets that Mr. Sapir was required to fix.</p>
        <p>Privately, executives at the authority said that Mr. Sapir's building managers were incompetent. Real estate executives in the city say that although Mr. Sapir may be a shrewd buyer, he is a poor operator who has a reputation as a late payer among contractors and real estate brokers who were owed commissions on his other buildings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sapir (pronounced suh-PEER), 52, left the Soviet Union in 1973 with a wave of Jewish immigrants. He landed in New York in 1976, where he drove a cab for three years before borrowing $10,000 against his taxi medallion to open a small electronics store. The store, at 200 Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron neighborhood, became a wholesale outlet for Soviet diplomats, K.G.B. agents and Politburo members.</p>
        <p>The contacts Mr. Sapir made in New York proved a boon when the Soviet Union collapsed. By the early 1990's, Mr. Sapir said, he was trading container loads of consumer electronics for multimillion-dollar oil contracts.</p>
        <p>''He cultivated people who came to the U.S. looking for a friendly person with whom they could deal,'' said Peter Pettibone, who was a lawyer for the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council, which is defunct.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sapir emerged on the New York real estate scene in 1994 with a pile of cash, eager to buy in a market devastated by a recession and corporate layoffs. He bought 2 Broadway a year later for $20.5 million. By 1999, the property was worth more than $200 million.</p>
        <p>''The guy made some brilliant real estate investments,'' said Darcy Stacom, a real estate broker at Cushman &amp; Wakefield who sold Mr. Sapir four buildings in the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Mr. Sapir picked up the accouterments of tycoons, including a home in Kings Point, a wealthy village on the North Shore of Long Island. He has been rebuilding his 64,000-square-foot mansion for more than five years, installing a swimming pool, a squash court and a bowling alley. Italian marble adorns everything from the living room floor to the boiler room walls.</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. Sapir said, he has been dogged by ugly rumors about the source of his wealth. ''They say I'm mafia, that I'll be indicted for money laundering,'' he complained. ''It didn't happen. Everything was done in the most legitimate way. No money laundering. No mafia.''</p>
        <p>In July 1998, the M.T.A. was in a hurry to consolidate its operations, which were scattered across two dozen buildings in Manhattan. On the day that the authority announced it was selling its office building and the Coliseum at Columbus Circle to the Related Companies and Time Warner for $345 million, it signed a 49-year lease for 2 Broadway. Mr. Sapir expected to net about $19 million a year from the lease, while the authority would be paying about $14 a square foot in annual rent, or one-third the going rate in the area.</p>
        <p>But the authority needed 2 Broadway to be ready for occupancy within a year, a remarkably short time frame for a building that required enormous work after years of neglect, real estate executives said.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Mr. Sapir would get up to $7 million in development fees and incentives to rebuild the lobby, elevators, bathrooms and heating systems, at a cost then estimated at $39 million to $55 million. If the cost exceeded that sum, the authority would lend the money at a low interest rate, and Mr. Sapir would pay it back by reducing the rent over 30 years. The authority then planned to spend an additional $328 million outfitting the interior space.</p>
        <p>Real estate brokers and some executives at the authority said that neither Mr. Sapir nor the man who oversaw his real estate empire, Fred Contini, had any experience with major commercial renovations.</p>
        <p>By December 1998, the authority's lawyer, John B. Wood, complained that work was proceeding slowly and filed a lawsuit claiming that the landlord had failed to get the proper insurance and performance bonds for contractors. He also objected to a short-term $86.5 million loan that Mr. Sapir took against the building from Credit Suisse First Boston, worried that if Mr. Sapir defaulted, the authority could be evicted.</p>
        <p>Two months later, Mr. Wood abruptly chose Mr. Contini to replace Mr. Sapir as the project developer, despite the fact that Mr. Contini was already overseeing the troubled project for Mr. Sapir. In the midst of the project, Mr. Contini and Mr. Sapir had a falling out. Mr. Contini would not comment other than to say he had nothing to do with the problems between the M.T.A. and Mr. Sapir.</p>
        <p>''Contini was in the best position to get the job done,'' said an authority executive who was involved in the project, ''rather than bringing in a whole new guy.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Sapir tried to place a new $230 million mortgage on 2 Broadway, money that would allow him to pay off bills and to finance renovations at three other buildings he owned.</p>
        <p>Knowing that a landlord-tenant dispute would scare away any bank, Mr. Sapir said, Mr. Wood refused to make peace unless he agreed to a long list of concessions. So, Mr. Sapir said, he finally agreed to step aside as project developer in May 1999. But he remained responsible for the project's costs without power over how the money was spent. The transportation authority then estimated the cost of his renovations at $120 million.</p>
        <p>From then on, ''Wood and Contini controlled the whole job,'' said a construction executive who was involved in 2 Broadway. ''When the M.T.A. took over, the costs changed. Huge upgrades went in.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wood continued to block the new mortgage, Mr. Sapir said. First Boston, which had been willing to lend him the money, finally quit out of frustration, according to one banker who was involved in the deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sapir was finally able to get a new mortgage last September, but not before he and his lenders, CTL Capital and Capital Lease Funding, hired Mr. D'Amato to try to work out a peace treaty with the authority's chairman, E. Virgil Conway.</p>
        <p>''We paid D'Amato $500,000,'' Mr. Sapir said. ''He was hired to go to the M.T.A. We got the financing as soon as he was involved.''</p>
        <p>Executives at CTL Capital and Capital Lease, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, confirmed Mr. Sapir's account.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mr. D'Amato, Lisa DeWald, said that the former senator had represented CTL Capital and Capital Lease, not Mr. Sapir, whom, she said, Mr. D'Amato did not know. She said that Mr. D'Amato ''did not act as a lobbyist,'' but would not discuss his duties. Mr. D'Amato is not registered with the state as a lobbyist.</p>
        <p>Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the transportation authority, said that neither Mr. Conway nor any other official at the authority had talked to Mr. D'Amato about the problems at 2 Broadway.</p>
        <p>Whatever happened, the detente was short-lived. In March, Mr. Sapir said, he asked the authority to hold off payment of $600,000 in bonuses to Mr. Contini for completing work on time. He said an angry Mr. Wood demanded that he withdraw the request, and when he did not, the authority refused to pay rent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sapir retaliated by filing a lawsuit claiming that the authority was in default on the lease, the first step toward eviction.</p>
        <p>The authority, in turn, filed a lawsuit claiming ''massive defaults'' on Mr. Sapir's part and got an injunction preventing eviction. It demanded $36 million in immediate rent reductions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sapir, who said the legal battles were costing him $150,000 a month, then went to court demanding that the authority pay rent while the dispute was adjudicated. He said that his lenders told him that they could foreclose if he did not pay $10 million by September. In subsequent court papers, the authority played down Mr. Sapir's dire predictions and suggested that the landlord was rich enough ''to write a check for $10 million tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>But Judge Rolando T. Acosta of Civil Court ruled on July 27 that the authority must pay $1.7 million a month in rent, including back rent, until the dispute is resolved in State Supreme Court. Mr. Kelly, the authority spokesman, said this ruling was being appealed.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the M.T.A. had lent the money for the work, now up to $156 million, at an extremely low interest rate, 1.25 percent. This was on top of its own $328 million in building improvements.</p>
        <p>''They've gotten themselves into a deal,'' one real estate executive said, ''where they could have built a building from the ground up cheaper than what they've spent.''</p>
