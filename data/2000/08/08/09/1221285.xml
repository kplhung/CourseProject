        <p>The top creative executive at the New York office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, has left the agency. Steve Landsberg, 42, chief creative officer, left to pursue ''an unusual opportunity that he could not divulge at this time,'' said John Berg, president at DDB New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berg confirmed Mr. Landsberg's departure, which was reported this week in Adweek.</p>
        <p>Mr. Landsberg had been co-chief creative officer with David Nathanson from July 1998 until Mr. Nathanson left in June to open the Bezos/ Nathanson Marketing Group in New York.</p>
        <p>With the loss of two top creative officers, Mr. Berg said that the accounts at the New York office had  been reassigned.</p>
        <p>Right now, most of the client duties will be handled by the three executive creative directors: Brian Fandetti, 52; Shen Tan, 37; and John Staffen, 39. They will report to Bob Scarpelli, 47, who was named chief creative officer for the United States in March; he is primarily based in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berg said replacing the top creative spot was ''among the options.''</p>
