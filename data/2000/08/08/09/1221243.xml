        <p>At a Democratic fund-raiser last month at the Upper West Side duplex apartment of the singer Paul Simon, Vice President Al Gore was introduced by Connecticut's senators, Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph I. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>After some preliminary remarks about the strength of the economy and the old ideas of Republicans, Mr. Gore began to bash big oil and big insurance companies, a staple nowadays of his stump speech.</p>
        <p>''We need to give the medical decisions back to the doctors, and take them away from the accountants and the H.M.O.'s and the insurance companies,'' he declared.</p>
        <p>The moment Mr. Gore uttered the words ''insurance companies,'' several of the people in Mr. Simon's living room snickered loudly. Insurance is to Connecticut what oil is to Oklahoma, what automobiles are to Michigan, what tobacco is to Kentucky. And Mr. Lieberman has been a staunch ally of the industry.</p>
        <p>Indeed, on a broad array of issues, Mr. Lieberman is perceived as a business-friendly Democrat. On some issues, including those that affect the insurance industry, he has been much more of a business ally than Mr. Gore. This could help the Democratic ticket in its fund-raising and in reassuring corporate leaders who are nervous about Mr. Gore's environmental views.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Lieberman is one of a handful of Democrats who support legislation to limit the amount of damages that can be collected from lawsuits. Such legislation has been at the top of corporate America's Washington wish list for more than a decade. Insurance companies have led the battle in favor it. Trial lawyers, among the Democratic Party's biggest contributors, have led the fight against the limits on damages. Mr. Lieberman has always been on the side of the insurance business. Mr. Gore has always been with the lawyers.</p>
        <p>''We consider Mr. Lieberman a friend of the insurance industry,'' said Jack Dolan, a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurance.</p>
        <p>By the same token, Mr. Lieberman has regularly voted for increases in the Pentagon's budget. Two major defense contractors, the General Dynamics Corporation and the United Technologies Corporation, have plants in Connecticut that employ thousands of workers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has been an ally of other companies that Mr. Gore has blasted in recent speeches, including  pharmaceutical companies. Several,  including the Bayer Corporation, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Pfizer Inc., have operations in Connecticut. In 1997, when the Senate was considering legislation to reauthorize the Food and Drug Administration, Mr. Lieberman was among the few Democrats who voted on the side of the drug industry on important amendments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has been rewarded for this support with campaign donations. The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan organization that tracks campaign money, reported today that Mr. Lieberman had received more money from the insurance interests for his Senate race this year than any other senator ($197,419), and more from pharmaceutical interests ($91,150) than any other senator except Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who is chairman of the Finance Committee's subcommittee on health. Mr. Lieberman has also received nearly $100,000 from political action committees and individuals connected to defense contractors.</p>
        <p>It is not surprising that Mr. Lieberman has been a standard bearer for important industries in his state. A politician who did not do that would not last very long in office.</p>
        <p>But as Democrats go, Mr. Lieberman has been quite friendly to business generally, something that could reassure corporate interests that have been tepid about Mr. Gore. Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said that in his two terms in the Senate, Mr. Lieberman had voted on the side of business interests more than almost any other Democrat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman is a vigorous supporter of international trade, a position similar to Mr. Gore's but different from many Democrats, and he is one of the few Democrats in the Senate who favors a reduction in the capital gains tax.</p>
        <p>In Silicon Valley, Mr. Lieberman is hailed as the senator who saved stock options.</p>
        <p>In 1994, accounting rulemakers considered changing the accounting procedures for stock options in a way that would have reduced the reported profits of companies that granted options to executives and other employees. It was one of the first Congressional issues to attract lobbying from executives in Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p>First, Mr. Lieberman pushed through the Senate a nonbinding resolution that denounced the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the arbiter of accounting procedures, for trying to change the rules. Then he introduced legislation to restrict the authority of the board. After that, the board backed down.</p>
        <p>In part for his role in the options fight, the American Electronic Association, a trade group of technology companies, named Mr. Lieberman to the ''high-tech legislative hall of fame.'' Mr. Gore considers the high-tech community an important constituency and has held many fund-raising events and meetings with its executives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's record in support of business interests could help Democratic fund-raising for the fall campaign.</p>
        <p>''Senator Lieberman's record on fiscal responsibility and issues with regard to business generally has been very strong, very moderate and ought to be very attractive to the business community,'' said Joel Jankowsky, who heads the lobbying arm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld, a Washington law firm.</p>
        <p>There is a business constituency that remains nervous about Mr. Lieberman: Hollywood. Entertainment executives, one of the Democratic Party's most important cash constituencies, are nervous about his embrace of the V-chip and his alliance with William J. Bennett, the former education secretary under President Ronald Reagan, in denouncing excessive violence and sex in movies, television and music. But that will not stop entertainment executives from organizing lavish parties for the Democratic ticket next week at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE RECORD  Correction:  August 12, 2000, Saturday  An editorial on Wednesday about Texas executions erred in saying that the Supreme Court has ruled that executing minors under age 16 violates the Constitution. In 1988, in a 5-to-4 decision overturning an Oklahoma statute, four justices agreed that executing a person who was 15 years old at the time a crime was committed would be unconstitutional; a fifth justice concurred on narrower grounds.</p>
