        <p>From above, the scene resembled a war zone: pillars of smoke, flashes of fire and vast expanses of charred remains.</p>
        <p>''There's a big plume of smoke over there,'' said President Clinton, who surveyed the devastation of the Burgdorf Junction fire, one of hundreds sweeping across the West, from his helicopter, Marine One, this morning. ''It looks like a bomb going off.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton visited the front lines of the fire, which has raced through 25,000 acres and become one of the largest blazes ravaging the Western states, to rally firefighters engaged in what amounts to a military-style operation. Their weapons are chain saws, helicopters loaded with water buckets and pulaskis, the combination ax and hoe used to dig containment trenches through the combustible trees.</p>
        <p>''I just wanted to get in the plane this morning and fly out here to say thanks,'' said Mr. Clinton, who shared a bag lunch with the firefighters in a mess hall hidden in the woods.</p>
        <p>Supporting the professional firefighters are 500 Army troops from the Fourth Infantry Division at Fort Hood, who have traded in their self-propelled howitzers for axes and are relying heavily on their military training.</p>
        <p>''This is as dangerous as it gets,'' said Lt. Col. Darryl A. Williams, a former military aide to the president who now leads soldiers here. ''No one is shooting at us, but the fire is a worthy adversary.''</p>
        <p>Colonel Williams said his  troops were eager to charge ahead but had been forced to learn that firefighting requires a more deliberate approach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton announced the release of $150 million in emergency funds to continue the fight. But the money will go quickly. The cost of the firefighting effort exceeds $10 million a day.</p>
        <p>Sam Wilbanks of the United States Forest Service, spent a recent night on the front lines of the Burgdorf Junction fire, which was started on July 9.</p>
        <p>After long days of digging ditches in the thin mountain air, firefighters often camp within sight of the enemy. Mr. Wilbanks said they rolled out their bedding on the rocky terrain and did something that seems odd under the circumstances.</p>
        <p>''We lit a little fire to stay warm,'' he said.</p>
