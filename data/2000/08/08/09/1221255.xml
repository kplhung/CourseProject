        <p>Hundreds of people in a 30-story public housing tower in Harlem were led from their steamy apartments yesterday after a malfunctioning  transformer in their building forced city housing officials to turn off electrical power, shutting off air-conditioning, fans and elevators on one of the hottest days of the year.</p>
        <p>Firefighters and police officers began going door to door in the 418-apartment building at 2971 Frederick Douglass Boulevard about 9 a.m., telling residents that power would be out indefinitely and offering assistance to those too old or sick to make it down alone. Many took them up on their offer. Most simply walked down darkened stairwells.</p>

        <p>Hundreds of people in a 30-story public housing tower in Harlem were led from their steamy apartments yesterday after a malfunctioning  transformer in their building forced city housing officials to turn off electrical power, shutting off air-conditioning, fans and elevators on one of the hottest days of the year.</p>
        <p>Firefighters and police officers began going door to door in the 418-apartment building at 2971 Frederick Douglass Boulevard about 9 a.m., telling residents that power would be out indefinitely and offering assistance to those too old or sick to make it down alone. Many took them up on their offer. Most simply walked down darkened stairwells.</p>
        <p>Five people suffering from heat exhaustion and two other tenants who are permanently on life support systems were taken to local hospitals, fire officials said. Hundreds of others, meanwhile, waited outside until an emergency generator was hooked up to the building's electrical system to provide temporary power by early afternoon.</p>
        <p>''I woke up this morning, and I was in a heat wave,'' said Tamika Jones, 20, as she sat on a bench outside the building with her infant son, Nashawn. ''It felt like 130 degrees in there. It felt like I was going to die. I couldn't take it, and then I had to walk all the way down the stairs.''</p>
        <p>The problem in the building, one of the four towers that make up the Polo Grounds Houses, a city-operated public housing development bounded by the Harlem River and West 155th Street, began shortly before midnight Monday when the 25-year-old transformer failed, said Howard Marder, a spokesman for the New York City Housing Authority. By 4:30 a.m. yesterday, workers installed a second transformer, the same age as the first.</p>
        <p>But after tenants began waking up in the morning and turning on appliances and radios and fans, a power surge apparently caused the second transformer to blow a fuse about 9 a.m., Mr. Marder said. The transformer began to spew smoke, he said, and housing officials cut power to the building so they could remove the transformer and find out precisely what went wrong.</p>
        <p>The transformer blowouts came on a two-day stretch of weather that National Weather Service meteorologists are calling the hottest in what has been a mild summer.</p>
        <p>The temperature hit a high of 88 degrees yesterday in Central Park, with a heat index -- the combined effect of temperature and humidity -- making it feel like 91. On Monday, the high was 89, but it felt like 97.</p>
        <p>''Without question, it's the hottest two days since the beginning of July,'' said Tim Morrin, a Weather Service meteorologist.</p>
        <p>''Based on temperatures alone, the 89 yesterday and the 88 today were the hottest since the beginning of July,'' he said. ''Then you also had the combined effects of the humidity these last two days.''</p>
        <p>Tenants said they certainly felt the heat envelop them like a wet blanket. With their air-conditioners and fans idled, the building was soon transformed into a stuffy, airless box, they said.</p>
        <p>''They cut off all the power,'' said Jacqueline Greene, 48, as she waited outside in the midday sun. ''No lights, no electricity, no elevators, no air-conditioning. Everything was cut off. It was very hot in our apartment, very hot.''</p>
        <p>Elsa Fermin, 46, said she was worried when the police arrived at her door. ''I said, 'Dios mio, what's this all about?' '' she recalled. ''Then it was so hot. It was incredible. We thought we were going to burn up.''</p>
        <p>Residents were not forced to evacuate their apartments -- police officers and firefighters simply went door to door to inform and offer help -- but most people left the building as the temperature continued to rise through the morning.</p>
        <p>One tenant who did not leave was Cheryl Powers, who runs a licensed day care center in her apartment on the 25th floor.</p>
        <p>Though she usually depends on four air-conditioners to cool her place, Ms. Powers said she simply made do by opening the windows. But no power meant no eggs or pancakes for her five young charges.</p>
        <p>''I need water, I need electricity, I need to cook,'' Ms. Powers said. ''I was still able to function, but I just wasn't able to prepare hot meals.''</p>
