        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Just as Dick Cheney brought George W. Bush gravitas in foreign policy, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman will bring Al Gore ethical gravitas (front page, Aug. 8).</p>
        <p>But I wonder how this choice, an obvious effort by Mr. Gore to distance himself from the Clinton legacy and his own shadow of campaign corruption, will do anything more than reinforce those very connections. It seems as if Mr. Gore, by selecting the senator from Connecticut as his running mate, has in effect admitted that Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney were correct in pointing out his vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>By admitting his primary weakness and by choosing Mr. Lieberman to alleviate that weakness, Mr. Gore has not only inexorably linked himself to his questionable past but has also joined Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney in making it the principal issue.</p>
