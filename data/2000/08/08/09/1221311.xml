        <p>For seven years, Derek Bell came to Shea Stadium as a visiting player and tried to ignore the swirl of excitement around him. He wasted no time adapting when he became a Met in December.</p>
        <p>At his introductory news conference, at a restaurant in Times Square, Bell made waves of reporters laugh with him. When he visited the Mets' locker room in January, he spoke hopefully of being assigned the No. 16 jersey worn by his childhood friend Dwight Gooden. In his first game at Shea, Bell hit the game-winning homer.</p>
        <p>''As a home player, you're like, 'Wow, this is awesome,' '' Bell said. ''I didn't really pay attention to how the fans are, how they're into every pitch, how much they know baseball, how loud the stadium gets. Now that I'm playing there, I know it's unique.''</p>
        <p>To Bell, it is a far different atmosphere from the one in Houston, where fans booed him heavily Monday night in his first game back after the Astros traded him to the Mets. Bell, who played five years in Houston, hit a game-tying homer with two outs in the ninth inning, then caught the final out of the Mets' 6-5 victory in the 11th.</p>
        <p>Bell turned to the fans behind him in right field, motioning as if he would throw the ball to them. Instead, he kept it and trotted in, giggling. After the game, Bell criticized the fans, using profanities and questioning their knowledge of baseball.</p>
        <p>''Take that,'' Bell said he thought when he hit the home run.</p>
        <p>In a way, Bell has done a Bobby Bonilla in reverse. Sensitive players are more often vilified in large news-media markets and insulated in smaller ones. But Bell, 0 for 3 in tonight's loss. has thrived in New York with a .298 average, 15 homers and 60 runs batted in. Gerry Hunsicker, the Astros' general manager and a former assistant G.M. for the Mets, figured Bell would do so.</p>
        <p>''I didn't think he'd have problems in New York, because Derek's a showman,'' Hunsicker said. ''He likes to be on stage, he likes the bright lights. I'm not surprised he's had success. He's a talented player.''</p>
        <p>With the Astros last year, Bell complained about being dropped in the batting order on the day Manager Larry Dierker returned from brain surgery. It was a poorly timed statement, but Bell could still not understand the way fans booed him.</p>
        <p>''I had so many sleepless nights last year thinking, 'What did I do?' '' Bell said. ''I never said nothing bad about the fans, I never said nothing bad about the city or any of the popular players. I played hard every day, played hurt for five years. I couldn't sleep sometimes trying to figure out why.''</p>
        <p>Bell feels appreciated by Mets fans, and that is important to him. Bell will be a free agent after the season, and while he does not say so directly, it is obvious he could see himself staying in New York. Last month, when Barry Larkin was deciding whether to accept a trade to the Mets, Bell joked that maybe Eric Goldschmidt, who represents both players, could sign them both to contract extensions with the Mets.</p>
        <p>''I'll worry about that stuff when the season's over in October,'' Bell said of his future. ''Right now, I'm just trying to get the Mets back to where they were in the 80's, when they had Dwight and all those guys.'' (He did get Gooden's No. 16.)</p>
        <p>Goldschmidt gave no indication of what Bell would want in a contract negotiation. He pointed to injuries as the cause of Bell's disappointing 1999 season, an indication that this year and Bell's strong 1998 will be the barometer of his market value.</p>
        <p>''The Mets haven't approached us about a contract,'' Goldschmidt said. ''With all their free agents, from what I've been told, they want to think about it after the season.''</p>
        <p>Besides Bell, the potential Mets free agents include Mike Bordick, John Franco, Mike Hampton, Bobby Jones, Rick Reed and Turk Wendell. The Mets may also pursue the free-agent shortstop Alex Rodriguez of Seattle.</p>
        <p>If the Mets sign Rodriguez, they will have expensive, productive offensive players at shortstop and catcher (Mike Piazza). In that arrangement, the Mets could opt for a young, inexpensive outfield of Benny Agbayani, Jay Payton and a player currently in the minors, such as Alex Escobar or Timoniel Perez. That would leave Bell out of the mix.</p>
        <p>Mets General Manager Steve Phillips said he does not anticipate negotiating with any potential free agents until after the season, and he would not comment on whether he wanted to bring Bell back.</p>
        <p>''He's played very well and played hard,'' Phillips said. ''He seems to enjoy New York and New York seems to enjoy him. But that's for a much later date to be considered.''</p>
