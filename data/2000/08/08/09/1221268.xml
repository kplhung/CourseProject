        <p>THE old pro may never do anything as spectacular in the rest of her career, but Teresa Weatherspoon will always have The Shot.</p>
        <p>It was not a dunk, not a drive of brute force, but a desperate running heave from midcourt that would bank in, yes, off the glass to prolong the finals for another game.</p>
        <p>It reverberates a year later, showing up on every highlight and advertisement for the Women's National Basketball Association:</p>
        <p>Flutie throwing the Hail Mary. Mr. October hitting his third of the night. Jordan, flapping his tongue, faking somebody out of the building. The big-game signature for an entire sport.</p>
        <p>A year later, Weatherspoon, now 34, took another shot to her fragile nose last night while making seven assists and six steals as the Liberty beat Cleveland, 57-44, to capture the home-court advantage for the first two rounds of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''Spoon is our most valuable player,'' reiterated the steady Sue Wicks after the game.</p>
        <p>Weatherspoon did her best to ratchet up the energy for the 18,663 fans. The ambience in Madison Square Garden is still sweet and spontaneous for this evolving league, which attracts female fans, family types, new faces. There was a woman with a bandana over her shaven head, and a tattoo, and assorted necklaces and rings, in Woody Allen's seat last night. The tone of the league is set by enthusiastic players who sign autographs and acknowledge their fans.</p>
        <p>''It might just be the woman way,'' Weatherspoon said with a smile.</p>
        <p>At 6 p.m. she was as gentle as an alto in the church choir but she promised she would not look that way an hour later, after her own version of meditation. For all that, Weatherspoon's feisty game face is hardly the female version of the grim glare Bernard King used to screw on in the Lincoln Tunnel before arriving at the Garden.</p>
        <p>''I go into my own little world,'' she said. ''We're not just basketball players, we're entertainers. The high fives, the facial looks, they're part of it.''</p>
        <p>Weatherspoon has been around. After leaving the basketball bastion of Louisiana Tech, she played seven years in Italy, loving the intensity. She played for the United States in Seoul in 1988, helping to win a gold medal, and she played in Barcelona in 1992, losing in the semifinals to the last remnants of the Soviet Union and saying later, ''This will leave a scar for the rest of our lives.''</p>
        <p>Able to come home in 1997, Weatherspoon has seen the league jump-start with unimagined average attendances of 9,669 the first year, 10,869 the second, 10,207 the third, and down to 8,988 this year, hurt in part by the early start due to the impending Summer Games in Australia.</p>
        <p>Last year, Weatherspoon knew the worst and the best of feelings. Before the season, she learned that her 19-year-old nephew, Anthony Weatherspoon, had died in a crash. She was very close to him, giving him advice that children resist from their own parents. After he was gone, whenever she did something special, she would point a forefinger to the rafters: that one was for Anthony.</p>
        <p>Her best moment came in Houston during the quickie two-of-three-game finals. Having lost the opener, the Liberty were in danger of going out with 2.4 seconds left when Weatherspoon took a pass, made two dribbles and heaved the ball with .4 seconds remaining. The ball slammed off the backboard and through the net and Weatherspoon remembered to raise her forefinger. For Anthony. Then she swooned to the floor.</p>
        <p>''What puts it to the side a little bit is that we didn't win the championship,'' she said last night. ''But it was good for the league.''</p>
        <p>''Some day I'd like to be sitting next to Jerry West and talk about it,'' Weatherspoon added, referring to West's classic 60-foot shot that tied the third game of the 1970 finals against the Knicks, who went on to win that game.</p>
        <p>The Liberty lost the third and deciding game but The Shot endures -- as marketable as any player the league has developed, even the stars going to the Summer Games.</p>
        <p>''I never gave it a thought,'' Weatherspoon said of Australia. ''I've had my day. It was great.''</p>
        <p>She is a Liberty now. She broke her nose last week but will not be hindered by a mask because ''I accept the consequences. I wouldn't want to miss one of my teammates open because of a mask.''</p>
        <p>Weatherspoon is one of only three players who have started every game in this fledgling league. With any luck, this league will long outlast her, and The Shot will live on.</p>
