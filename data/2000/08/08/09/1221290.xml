        <p>The Dial Corporation, which makes Dial soap and Armour canned meats, said yesterday that its top two executives had resigned and it warned that it would miss earnings expectations for the third time this year.</p>
        <p>Malcolm Jozoff, the chairman, president and chief executive since 1996, who ushered the company through three years of rapid growth before it stalled this year, was succeeded by Herbert M.

        <p>The Dial Corporation, which makes Dial soap and Armour canned meats, said yesterday that its top two executives had resigned and it warned that it would miss earnings expectations for the third time this year.</p>
        <p>Malcolm Jozoff, the chairman, president and chief executive since 1996, who ushered the company through three years of rapid growth before it stalled this year, was succeeded by Herbert M. Baum, 63, the president of Hasbro Inc. and a Dial board member since 1997. Susan J. Riley, the executive vice president and chief financial officer for the last three years, also stepped down and was succeeded by the company controller, Jack Tierney.</p>
        <p>The overhaul comes after a troubled first half for the company, based in Scottsdale, Ariz. Its stock has tumbled recently to its lowest level since 1996, when Dial spun off its travel services to focus exclusively on consumer brands like Purex detergent and Breck shampoo.</p>
        <p>Twice before, in March and again in June, Dial warned investors that languishing sales, inventory backlogs and price cuts by competitors would drive earnings down as much as 30 percent for the year. In response, analysts, some of whom expected Dial to earn $1.30 a share in 2000, lowered their forecasts to 77 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's announcement made it clear that analysts will have to revise their estimates yet again and are awaiting a conference call with Mr. Baum in the coming weeks before setting new projections.</p>
        <p>''It really was a surprise to have another negative earnings announcement,'' said John P. Hughes of Dain Rauscher Wessels.</p>
        <p>Shares of Dial fell 87.5 cents yesterday, to $11.9375.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Jozoff took control of Dial in 1996, he introduced new products, cast off other unprofitable ones and cut prices on core brands. The move led to a turnaround, jump-starting growth from minimal to roughly 15 percent a year.</p>
        <p>To sustain that pace, Dial began a series of acquisitions, from Sarah Michaels in 1998 to Freeman Cosmetics last year. This year, the company bought Coast soap from Procter &amp; Gamble and joined forces with Henkel, a German chemical company, to introduce a premium line of its Purex brand.</p>
        <p>But the performance of its recent acquisitions has been lackluster, company officials acknowledge. Over all, Dial's sales have slumped more than 5 percent this year.</p>
