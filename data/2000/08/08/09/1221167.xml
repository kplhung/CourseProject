      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>LIKE pesto, tapenade is an all-purpose sauce based on a single pungent ingredient. The Provencal olive paste can be used as a dip for raw vegetables, a spread for bread or a flavorful partner for anything from grilled shrimp or fish to chicken. I especially like to add it for heft and taste to an easy salad of tomato, basil and mozzarella. And then the salad itself can be taken to another level by spooning it onto grilled bread to make a quick bruschetta or even onto pasta as an uncooked sauce.</p>
        <p>Tapenade is a welcome change from pesto at this time of year, but it also has the distinct advantage of being easy to make year round. Unlike fresh basil, olives are always in season. The base is almost always black olives in brine, which are better for this sauce than oil-cured olives. Green olives make an interesting alternative, though. Tapenade is usually spiked with anchovies and capers, although I find that one or the other is sufficient.</p>

        <p>Tapenade is a welcome change from pesto at this time of year, but it also has the distinct advantage of being easy to make year round. Unlike fresh basil, olives are always in season. The base is almost always black olives in brine, which are better for this sauce than oil-cured olives. Green olives make an interesting alternative, though. Tapenade is usually spiked with anchovies and capers, although I find that one or the other is sufficient.</p>
        <p>California ripe olives are not great for tapenade, but there are literally tons of good, inexpensive olives from Italy, Greece, Spain and France. Avoid those that have been seasoned, because the best tapenade is dominated by the strong flavor of olives and little else.</p>
        <p>The quickest way to pit them is to press them with the flat side of a knife or the bottom of a pot so that the olive splits and can be pulled off the pit. To make the puree, a mortar and pestle produces the perfect texture, but a blender or food processor is quicker and easier. The best texture for tapenade is slightly chunky, not creamy.</p>
        <p>The salad itself is fairly straightforward, although I cut the tomatoes into wedges and the mozzarella into chunks instead of slices. It can be varied by using a good fresh sheep's milk cheese or thin slices of Parmigiano-Reggiano in place of the mozzarella.</p>
        <p>If you choose to use the salad as a sauce for pasta, cut the mozzarella very small.</p>
        <p>TOMATO SALAD WITH TAPENADE  Total: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>4 ripe medium tomatoes  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  4 ounces pitted black olives, about 1 cup  2 anchovy fillets or 1 teaspoon capers, or both  2 teaspoons sherry vinegar  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1/2 pound mozzarella, preferably fresh</p>
        <p>1/2 cup shredded or roughly chopped basil.</p>
        <p>1. Core the tomatoes, and cut them into eighths. Salt them lightly, and let sit while you make the tapenade.</p>
        <p>2. Combine the olives, anchovies or capers, vinegar, oil and 1 tablespoon water in a blender or small food processor. Blend until pureed, but not too fine. Add more water if necessary; the mixture should be fairly loose. Taste the puree, and add salt and pepper as you like.</p>
        <p>3. Cut the mozzarella into chunks, and toss with the tomatoes and about half the tapenade; season with salt and pepper if necessary, and add more tapenade to taste. Garnish with basil, and serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
