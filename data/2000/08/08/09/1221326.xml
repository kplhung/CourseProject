        <p>Alfonso Soriano has played his own personal game of Survivor this summer. Every time the Yankees called a tribal council to discuss trades for a major league player, it seemed Soriano's name was being written on slips of paper. Whether it was in talks for Juan Gonzalez, Sammy Sosa, Denny Neagle or Rondell White, it was Soriano that the other team wanted included in the deal.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, however, were able to add five players to their roster without giving up their top prospect. And that means Soriano, the native of San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican Republic who now plays for the Yankees' top farm team in Columbus, Ohio, should be able to set up camp in the Bronx for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>''It makes me feel good,'' he said of the trade interest. ''It makes me feel important that other teams want me. But it was bothering my game and making me feel uncomfortable. I wasn't concentrating well during games.''</p>
        <p>So, what's all the fuss about?</p>
        <p>Soriano was hitting .277 with 10 home runs and 50 runs batted in through Monday in the Class AAA International League. He also hit .167 with 2 homers and 2 R.B.I. in 42 at-bats with the Yankees this season. Those are hardly numbers to make anyone gasp. But at just 22 years old and with 160 pounds on a 6-foot-1-inch frame, there is plenty of room for growth.</p>
        <p>Yankee veterans were stunned during spring training at the power the angular Soriano showed at the plate, especially with the strength Soriano, a right-handed batter, displayed in hammering balls into right-center field.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I think it gets lost that his career has gone rather fast since joining the Yankees,'' Trey Hillman, the Columbus manager, said. ''It was just 1998 that I had him in the Arizona Fall League. And he's had a lot happen to him since then. With the number of rumors and two stints going to the big leagues and five weeks playing second base, we've thrown a lot at him and he's held up very well.''</p>
        <p>Soriano has played most of his career at shortstop, where the Yankees plan to have Derek Jeter for a long time. But because of Chuck Knoblauch's throwing problems and injuries this year, Soriano has learned to play second. Last year, he played some third base for Columbus, and though he says the organization has not discussed it with him, Soriano could eventually supply the answer to the Yankees' search for a permanent left fielder.</p>
        <p>''Alfonso Soriano is best suited for whatever the team's needs are,'' Hillman said. ''He's that talented. His best position would be in the middle infield, but he has the athletic ability to play the outfield. The throw would be longer, but he has an above-average arm.''</p>
        <p>For Soriano, his defensive position matters little as long as it is at the major league level, and teaming with Jeter has its allure. If that happens, that would be in my best interest, he said.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, however, it is Soriano's bat that will get him to the majors and make him a star.</p>
        <p>''He has a very high ceiling,'' Hillman said. ''He can be an impact player offensively and he can play whatever position you have a need at. He has the opportunity to put up Jeter-type offensive numbers without that high of an average. And he has a frame that could carry another 25 pounds of muscle and the ability to hit for power.''</p>
        <p>INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE</p>
        <p>In another year when balls keep flying out of big-league parks, the league has had some dominant pitching performances. Rick Krivda of Rochester, was named pitcher of the week last week without winning a game. Krivda, a 10-year pro, did not allow a run and yielded only three hits in 16 innings, but could manage only two no-decisions. He is 11-7 with a 3.00 earned run average for the Red Wings this season. . . . Jim Brower of Buffalo dueled with Tomo Ohka of Pawtucket, R.I., for eight innings and allowed an unearned run on seven hits and two walks with eight strikeouts. Buffalo won, 2-1, in 13 innings on a Mark Whiten homer. Brower has given up just one earned run over 21 innings since returning to the Bisons from Cleveland. . . . The Columbus left-hander Randy Keisler has struck out 47 batters in 50 innings since June 30. In those seven starts, he is 6-0 with a 1.44 E.R.A., allowing more than one earned run just once.</p>
        <p>EASTERN LEAGUE</p>
        <p>Binghamton, N.Y., was down to its last out Monday night, trailing host New Britain, Conn., 1-0, before Bryon Gainey slugged a two-run homer to eventually give the Mets a 2-1 victory and extend their winning streak to 14 games. The Mets' Class AA affiliate tied Lancaster of the Class A Advanced California League for the longest streak in minor league baseball this season.</p>
        <p>. . . The Altoona (Pa.) Curve completed an 11-day, 10-game road trip Friday. Its reward? The team's longest bus ride of the season, 552 miles, from Portland, Me., to Altoona.</p>
