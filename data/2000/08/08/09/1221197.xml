        <p>THE transition has been stunning and fast. Seven weeks ago, Alain Ducasse was France's gift to New York, a chef with eight Michelin stars, opening the ultimate in luxurious restaurants. The anticipation surrounding the restaurant, Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, had it booked for months, and had produced a six-month waiting list with 2,700 names.</p>
        <p>Then the doors opened, and everything seemed to go wrong.</p>
        <p>The food world buzzed about the disappointing cooking and the absentee chef. Endless stories mocked the $500 tabs, the wine list with some bottles marked up 1,000 percent, and the goofy dining-room rituals like the presentation of a selection of knives with every squab and a choice of expensive pens for signing the check. The coverage went from bad to worse, hitting bottom with an article in Fortune magazine headlined ''Ishtar: The Restaurant.'' The restaurant took out a classified ad seeking employees a few weeks after opening, amid rumors that waiters were quitting because of paychecks that were slow in coming and tips that were minuscule.</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, it was possible to book a table for the very next day.</p>
        <p>A two-page cartoon in The New Yorker titled ''A Cancellation at the Alain Ducasse'' subtly belittled the place for its pretensions. The review in The New York Post was scathing. William Grimes, the restaurant critic of The New York Times, wondered in a column about an evening at the restaurant, ''Would I ever lay eyes on Mr. Ducasse?''</p>
        <p>The Guardian in London weighed in 10 days after the restaurant opened, asking why the first New Yorkers to try it ''say it's only 'O.K.' '' The Daily Telegraph of London asked if ''the opening of Ducasse will prove to have been an important cultural watershed, marking the beginning of the end of the cult of celebrity chef.'' Within the last week, New York magazine and USA Today concluded that, for the price, the place falls short.</p>
        <p>So far, the restaurant's good notices have appeared either in fringe publications or have not been reviews of the food.</p>
        <p>It wasn't the welcome expected by Mr. Ducasse, who was interviewed through an interpreter about his New York reception. He is the only chef in the world with two Michelin three-star restaurants -- one in Paris, the other in Monte Carlo -- plus two one-star restaurants scattered among his other 10.</p>
        <p>A decade ago, at 33, he was the youngest chef ever to be awarded three stars. But even in Paris, he said, he initially faced the same sort of bad press when he opened, in 1986. In New York, he said, ''perhaps it is a little surprising how aggressive it is.'' And he added that ''if people will not accept this price, we will go elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>Andre Soltner, who was famous for not leaving the stove in his four-star restaurant, Lutece, said that if Mr. Ducasse talked in this way ''he's kaput, because New Yorkers don't have to accept that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Soltner, who sold the restaurant five years ago, was interviewed by telephone from France, where he is on vacation. ''When people spend $300 or $400 for a meal they want you to be there,'' he said. ''They want you to cook a little. They want a little personal attention, and they want the food to be perfect. If New Yorkers think they are being taken for a ride, then Ducasse will have problems. If the food is not as good as about 20 restaurants in New York, then he will have to pack up and leave.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Soltner has not eaten at the restaurant yet, he said, because he wanted to give it a chance to settle in -- something the 2,700 people the restaurant said were on the waiting list were not willing to do.</p>
        <p>The claim that it is booked until December is apparently highly inflated. In fact, using several names that would be unknown to the restaurant, on a recent Thursday I was able to book for the following Monday; last Tuesday, I booked for dinner the next night; last Wednesday, I booked for lunch the next day. There have been so many no-shows that the restaurant now charges $150 to a credit card when a table is booked.</p>
        <p>Others have reported the same experience. Michael Batterberry, a co-founder of Food Arts magazine, who ate lunch there recently, said 6 or 7 of the 18 tables were empty, a situation other diners at lunch have also reported.</p>
        <p>Empty tables only compound a problem that some waiters complained about bitterly: with just 65 seats in the restaurant, and only two lunches and five dinners a week, each with only one seating, total tips can be lower than at a place that is open for lunch and dinner and where the tables turn at least twice.</p>
        <p>''I figured that out myself,'' one former waiter said. He said he left because he is an actor and wanted to be in Los Angeles. The gratuity system at the restaurant rewards points to each dining room employee depending on his job.</p>
        <p>But he added that if he were a professional waiter he would have stayed there even though he could have earned more money elsewhere. ''It's a great place to work for a professional waiter, because you learn a lot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Urs Kaufmann, the manager of the restaurant, said that some staff members did quit in the first weeks, but that that was common at a new restaurant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaufmann acknowledged problems with the pay in the beginning, but he said the restaurant was not fully booking nor was it serving private parties for the first couple of weeks. Four servers are assigned to four or five tables at each meal, he said.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what their expectations were,'' Mr. Kaufmann said, ''but one waiter confronted me in front of the entire staff with an absolutely ludicrous number. He said you can go and work at Jean Georges and make $3,000 a week. I was left speechless, because that is just rubbish.''</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Kaufmann said, there were so many complaints when the paychecks turned out ''so much below everyone's expectations, we quickly issued extra cash checks to ease the tension.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''If a large number of staff leave and we constantly have to retrain staff, it costs so much time and effort and in the long run we could never sustain that.''</p>
        <p>There might be another reason some of the waiters left: the system of payment. At many restaurants, tips are distributed nightly; at Ducasse, tips are included in the paychecks, with taxes withheld. ''I'm not sure they were used to this system,'' Mr. Kaufmann said.</p>
        <p>While one seating may not provide the kind of tips available elsewhere, Mr. Ducasse insists that giving diners the table for the entire evening is essential to the mood of the restaurant, and it is one of the reasons he charges at least one-third more than the other top restaurants here. The food, he said, is only part of the experience. And he said the chef doesn't need to be present all  the time.</p>
        <p>''The importance of the chef is to form a good team to function without the chef being there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He added that he had spent a year teaching his kitchen staff technique, and that ''18 chefs in the kitchen is sufficient for 65 covers.''</p>
        <p>Even so, because of the criticism about his absence, Mr. Ducasse says he is spending more time at the restaurant.</p>
        <p>''If you want to talk about price, you have to talk about what you are getting,'' he said. ''The luxury of space and time. Our guests are still sitting here at 11:30.</p>
        <p>''Good service, even down to the details of the waiters' suits, bread that is baked twice a day, organic flour that is imported from South America, the best ingredients. The idea that we are pretentious because we offer a selection of knives is ridiculous. I don't know any other restaurant where they do that. Perhaps the people who are writing that have only average knowledge of what they were writing about.''</p>
        <p>But it isn't only the critics who have been underwhelmed by the food. Many people who have eaten at the restaurant have been disappointed, including some chefs who describe Mr. Ducasse as a genius.</p>
        <p>''We went once, but we're not going a second time,'' said Amy Stein, a harpist who lives in Manhattan. ''The atmosphere was fantastic. The food was very nice, but it didn't make me cry like some restaurants in Paris do. You can go to other restaurants in New York and have a great meal for less money.''</p>
        <p>Other reports mentioned blood in the foie gras and that the pigeon was cooked medium when it should have been medium-rare.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ducasse dismisses such criticism by suggesting that the diners don't know what they are talking about. For example, there have been numerous complaints about the toughness of the lobster in the lobster ravioli. To that Mr. Ducasse said, ''A perfectly cooked lobster is slightly rubbery.''</p>
        <p>''The clientele in New York are capable of understanding what we do,'' he continued. ''Mai oui. Bien sur. Bien sur.''</p>
        <p>Maybe that's the problem.</p>
