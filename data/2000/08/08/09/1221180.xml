        <p>FLASHMAN AND THE TIGER  By George MacDonald Fraser  347 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.</p>
        <p>Good old Flashy, the high-living cowardly hero, the man for whom that delicious Victorian word poltroon might have been invented. Here he is in his latest installment, sprawled on the ground outside a private club, dressed like ''an elderly down-at-heel of the kind that slinks round the West End streets, picking up cigar butts'' and pretending to be in a drunken stupor.</p>
        <p>Two policemen who have just apprehended a man that Flashman wanted to murder see him there, and one of them starts to say that he looks like somebody: ''You know, made such a hash of the Khartoum business, with Gordon . . . yes, and years ago he won a great name in Russia, and the Mutiny -- V.C. and knighthood -- it's on the tip of my tongue.''</p>
        <p>Brig. Gen. Harry Paget Flashman, for those who have not yet been introduced to the historical novels of George MacDonald Fraser, is the British soldier who manages to turn up at every major event of the mid- to late 19th century, from the Crimean War and the Sepoy Mutiny to Custer's last stand. Wherever he appears, he somehow emerges with his reputation for valor intact even though he spends most of his time trying to escape danger. In placing his main character in such well-researched settings, Mr. Fraser actually teaches us some history, history with flavor, history with sweep, history as grand, morally dubious, sanguinary spectacle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fraser's new book, the 11th in the Flashman series, is ''Flashman and the Tiger,'' in which our hero stumbles, grumbles and fornicates his way through three separate episodes. The longest recounts Flashman's unwitting sabotaging of an assassination attempt against Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary in 1883. Another reveals Flashman's role in preserving the reputation of the Prince of Wales (known as Beastly Bertie to the irreverent Flash) in a card-cheating scandal in England in 1880. The third has to do with a duel to the death between Flashman and a certain Tiger Moran, who is blackmailing his granddaughter. The new volume isn't the best of the Flashman books, precisely because of the minor-episode quality to them. Still, it is entertaining and pedagogically valuable. Aficionados will not want to miss it.</p>
        <p>''You don't know Blowitz, probably never heard of him even,'' is Flashman's first line in the first of the stories, and therein lies part of Mr. Fraser's genius. Blowitz is such an interesting eccentric that one assumes he is entirely a fictional invention. He is the corpulent, charming, manipulative, ambitious correspondent of The London Times in Paris, and it is he who gets Flashman involved in the plot to protect Franz Josef. But while Flashman is fictitious, Blowitz is not, or at least not entirely. He really was The London Times's man in Paris, and if you went to a good research library you could read his memoirs (which is probably what Mr. Fraser did).</p>
        <p>That Blowitz was real gives ''Flashman and the Tiger'' the sense that one gets from all of the Flashman books, namely that actual history turns up a thicker thicket of human types than mere imagination would be capable of producing.  There is also a larger historical lesson in Mr. Fraser's first episode, which has to do with Hungarian nationalism under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the interests of the conservative powers of Europe in  preventing Hungary from becoming independent. ''I understood it was the biggest state in the empire bar Austria itself,'' Flashman says of Hungary, ''and that the natives were an ornery lot, but fine horsemen.''</p>
        <p>Spies of the German Chancellor, Otto Bismarck, have learned that just such an ornery lot, a Hungarian group known as the Holnup, is plotting to assassinate the emperor, an event that would throw Europe into turmoil. Flashman is dragooned into a scheme to prevent an assassination from happening. The trick is that the emperor must be protected but kept from knowing that he is being protected until after he has been saved. That necessity provides the story's comic potential, but, unlike most manipulations of history for dramatic purposes, it also makes historical sense.</p>
        <p>In a way, Flashman is the reluctant James Bond of the 19th century, an adventurer in the service of the crown who provides action and suspense but is not to be taken too seriously. Like Bond, Flashman is very much a ladies' man, and he beds down with more women than you can count, referring to all his partners in language that might be authentic for that century but are politically incorrect now.</p>
        <p>In general, Mr. Fraser makes few concessions to our current sensibilities, and this may offend some readers. He talks about the Zulu warriors who crushed a British Army in South Africa in 1879 in terms that seem plainly racist by today's standards, even as he shows his respect for their bravery and skill.</p>
        <p>Then again, Flashman shows a vernacular contempt for just about everybody. In his jaundiced view, the British aristocracy is that ''genteel rabble;'' his wife is ''featherbrained'' and he himself is ''a true-blue coward who'd sooner shirk a fight than eat his dinner, and has run from more battlefields than he can count.''</p>
        <p>There is a vision of the human condition here, of the paradox of image and reality. Because of the fog of circumstance, Flashman remains a hero, even as he confesses that he is really a coward. Knowing him better than his admiring contemporaries do, we are in on Mr. Fraser's little joke, which is that things are sometimes the opposite of what they appear to be. We also understand that Flashman is the kind of poltroon brave enough to admit when he is scared.</p>
        <p>Nobody in this new volume seems aware of that fabulous fact other than us, Mr. Fraser's fortunate readers.</p>
