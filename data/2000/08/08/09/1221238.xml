      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Shares of Verizon, the nation's No. 1 local phone company, had been under pressure for weeks. Yesterday, they plunged.</p>
        <p>That is what happens when a company says that it will not be able to meet its financial targets, as Verizon did, even when some investors already suspected that such an announcement was coming, as some did.</p>
        <p>But the magnitude of the shortfall was a surprise to most yesterday, because Verizon also said it had agreed to acquire control of NorthPoint Communications Group, a high-speed Internet provider, in a deal that would further dilute Verizon's earnings.</p>
        <p>So as 86,000 unionized employees entered the third day of their strike against the company, investors also walked out on Verizon, sending the company's shares down almost 14 percent yesterday, their sharpest one-day drop since 1987.</p>
        <p>It did not help the labor negotiations that the NorthPoint deal could be seen as a provocative affront to Verizon's unions, which have been trying to organize the company's Internet operation. And it did not help Verizon with investors that the company also announced financial results for the second quarter that failed to meet Wall Street's expectations.</p>
        <p>In fairness, Verizon's inability to meet its previous financial targets is not really a result of bad execution in actually running its business. This contrasts, for example, with AT&amp;T, which has seen its shares tumble amid criticism that it has mismanaged its units that serve business customers.  The issues at Verizon, formed in June by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the GTE Corporation, reflect less poorly on the company's executives.</p>
        <p>Until yesterday, financial analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial, a financial research firm, had predicted that Verizon would earn $3.15 a share this year and the company's own guidance had been that it would show per-share earnings growth of 13 to 15 percent in 2001. After all of the adjustments, the company said yesterday that it would instead earn $2.90 to $2.94 a share this year and that that figure could be expected to increase by 5 to 6 percent in 2001.</p>
        <p>Part of that change could have been anticipated by outsiders. Part of it could not have.</p>
        <p>Delays and concessions involved in winning regulatory approval for the merger caused part of the problem. Bell Atlantic and GTE originally anticipated completing the deal at the beginning of this year rather than in midsummer. The delay meant they could squeeze out only about half of the cost savings they had anticipated for the year. In addition, federal and state regulators extracted various perhaps-unanticipated commitments from Verizon that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Some analysts also expressed dismay yesterday that much of the combined company's projected growth had been expected to come from a change in accounting for GTE's pension liabilities; yesterday Verizon said it would not include the effect of the pension accounting in its future operational results.</p>
        <p>The slower growth anticipated for next year is also largely because of the timing and impact of acquisitions and outside investments. Because Bell Atlantic, as a former part of the Bell System monopoly, is not allowed to sell long-distance communications services in most of its traditional territory, the combined Verizon was required by regulators to sell to the public more than 90 percent of GTE's long-distance Internet subsidiary, formerly BBN and now known as Genuity.</p>
        <p>Verizon, however, was counting on Genuity's rapid expansion to help the larger company make its growth target, and now it cannot. In addition, delays in the completion of Verizon's wireless joint venture with Vodafone AirTouch P.L.C. have also hampered Verizon's ability to meet its growth targets for 2001.</p>
        <p>But the biggest negative impact on Verizon's growth prospects next year will be the NorthPoint deal and Verizon's agreement announced Monday to acquire the OnePoint Communications Corporation, a small private company, for an undisclosed amount. Between them, the NorthPoint and OnePoint deals will dilute Verizon's per-share earnings growth by about 5 percent.</p>
        <p>While OnePoint is private, NorthPoint is public, and the peculiar structure of yesterday's deal reflects the difficult time NorthPoint and its brethren have had winning investors' confidence.</p>
        <p>NorthPoint, along with competitors including Covad Communications and Rhythms NetConnections, is in the business of building systems in telephone offices around the nation that can deliver torrents of Internet data over standard telephone wires, using a technology known as digital subscriber line, or D.S.L. Shares in all three companies are trading significantly below levels at which they offered stock to the public last year, largely because the D.S.L. business has proved more complicated than the companies expected.</p>
        <p>Verizon is also in the D.S.L. business. In yesterday's deal, Verizon agreed to combine its D.S.L. unit and $800 million in cash into NorthPoint in exchange for 55 percent of the company. What is unusual is that $350 million of that figure is to be distributed directly to NorthPoint's existing shareholders, as a kind of special dividend of about $2.50 a share.</p>
        <p>In a capital-intensive, high-growth (and nonunion) industry like the Internet, that money would almost always be expected to be plowed back into helping the business grow. The only obvious reason to direct that much cash directly to the shareholders would simply be to compensate them for the shares' lackluster performance. In fact, in a news release yesterday the companies said that shareholders owning about 48 percent of NorthPoint had already agreed to the deal, so it might appear that the payoff was necessary to win their approval in the first place.</p>
        <p>Shares of NorthPoint fell 75 cents, to $14.25, yesterday in Nasdaq trading.</p>
        <p>Discounting many special charges including a one-time pension-related gain, Verizon reported earnings of $1.97 billion, or 72 cents a share, up from $1.87 billion, or 67 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Including the pension gain, the company earned 81 cents a share, 2 cents less than the consensus estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>Revenue rose 16 percent, to $16.79 billion for the quarter.</p>
        <p>Shares of Verizon ended the day down $5.8125, or 13.8 percent, at $42.0625.</p>
