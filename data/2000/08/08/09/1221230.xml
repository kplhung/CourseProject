        <p>Cisco Systems Inc. reported a 61 percent gain in sales for its fiscal fourth quarter today, as the company continued to be the leading supplier of the necessary hardware for the build-up of the Internet. It was the company's 10th consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth.</p>
        <p>Excluding acquisition-related charges, Cisco earnings exceeded analysts' published estimates by a penny a share.</p>
        <p>Separately, Cisco said its No. 2 executive, Donald J. Listwin, was resigning to lead an unnamed company in which Cisco is a minority shareholder. Mr. Listwin, whose title was executive vice president, is leaving after 10 years with the company, where he was responsible for Cisco's New World business strategy and led its service provider and consumer businesses as well as corporate marketing.</p>
        <p>Cisco reported its results after the close of the market. Cisco shares closed at $65.50, down 75 cents, in Nasdaq trading.</p>
        <p>For the quarter ended July 29, Cisco reported earnings of $796 million, or 11 cents a diluted share, up 32 percent compared with $605 million, or 8 cents a share, for the period a year earlier. Sales rose 61 percent to $5.72 billion, compared with $3.56 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999.</p>
        <p>Cisco said its pro forma net income, which excludes the effects of acquisition charges, payroll tax on stock option exercises and net gains realized on minority investments, was $1.20 billion, or 16 cents a diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, compared with $710 million, or 10 cents a share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, increases of 69 percent and 60 percent, respectively. Analysts had expected Cisco to earn 15 cents a share, according to First Call.</p>
        <p>''The quarter, as expected, looks very strong,'' said Greg Geiling, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. Revenue growth of 61 percent year over year, and 16 percent over the immediately previous quarter, ''are tremendous numbers for a company this size,'' he said. ''And it looks like very balanced growth across all the business lines, which is just what you like to see.''</p>
        <p>During the quarter, Cisco completed the acquisitions of Atlantech Technologies Ltd., JetCell Inc., PentaCom Ltd., Qeyton Systems and Seagull Semiconductor Ltd. for a combined purchase price, including assumed liabilities, of approximately $1.39 billion, and took one-time charges of $461 million, or approximately 6 cents a share, on an after-tax basis, as write-offs of purchased in-process research and development. Additionally, Cisco completed the acquisitions of ArrowPoint Communications Inc., the InfoGear Technology Corporation and SightPath Inc., which were accounted for as poolings of interests.</p>
        <p>''We predicted five years ago that we were in the midst of a second Industrial Revolution that would determine the prosperity of companies, countries, and individuals. Today, the Internet continues to drive the strongest U.S. economy in history,'' John Chambers, Cisco's president and chief executive, said in a statement. ''We see no indications in the marketplace that the radical Internet business transformation in practices like customer service, supply-chain management, employee training, empowerment, and e-commerce that is taking place around the world today is slowing -- in fact, we believe it is accelerating globally.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Chambers also said that Cisco is experiencing some of the problems that come with explosive growth. Particularly in new product areas, the company has been constrained by shortages of crucial components, and is taking steps to increase order volume with its major suppliers. Lead times on its own products reached what Mr. Chambers called ''an undesirable peak'' in June, but he added that he expected improvements in manufacturing management to return these times to normal by the end of the calendar year.</p>
        <p>For the year, Cisco reported earnings of $2.67 billion, or 36 cents a diluted share, compared with $2.02 billion, or 29 cents a share, for fiscal 1999. Sales rose 55 percent, to $18.93 billion, compared with $12.17 billion for fiscal 1999.</p>
        <p>Cisco's pro forma net income was $3.91 billion, or 53 cents a diluted share, for fiscal 2000, compared with pro forma net income of $2.52 billion or 36 cents a share for fiscal 1999, increases of 56 percent and 47 percent, respectively.</p>
