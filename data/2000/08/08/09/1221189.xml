        <p>The hippies are gone, and so is Jesus' Superman jersey (it's been replaced by a white T-shirt with a sunlike emblem on it), but ''Godspell,'' in its newest incarnation at the Theater at Saint Peter's Church in Midtown, still has the giddy rapture that made it a hit both off Broadway and on in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>A musical set in Manhattan as a retelling of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, it's a show that has always had a cultish following -- not surprising, given that its spirit is an amalgamation of flower child and perfervid Christian. And this production, directed by Shawn Rozsa to a tirelessly enthusiastic pitch, takes the attitude that you're a fool not to believe. To judge from the adults singing along at a recent performance in the company of their young children, the show's allure remains strong among the converted.</p>

        <p>The hippies are gone, and so is Jesus' Superman jersey (it's been replaced by a white T-shirt with a sunlike emblem on it), but ''Godspell,'' in its newest incarnation at the Theater at Saint Peter's Church in Midtown, still has the giddy rapture that made it a hit both off Broadway and on in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>A musical set in Manhattan as a retelling of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, it's a show that has always had a cultish following -- not surprising, given that its spirit is an amalgamation of flower child and perfervid Christian. And this production, directed by Shawn Rozsa to a tirelessly enthusiastic pitch, takes the attitude that you're a fool not to believe. To judge from the adults singing along at a recent performance in the company of their young children, the show's allure remains strong among the converted.</p>
        <p>If, however, you are like me -- that is, someone whose teeth are set on edge by the show's most famous song, ''Day by Day'' -- this revival may bring on the same feelings evoked when the Jehovah's Witnesses ring the doorbell. There's no reason to be mean about it, but it does try your patience.</p>
        <p>There's some cosmetic updating here: the characters are dressed in contemporary clothing and given contemporary locutions and cell phones; there are several references to familiar advertising slogans; and Kevin Lock's junkyard set has a prominent discarded computer.</p>
        <p>But like the original, this ''Godspell'' is a good-humored work without being particularly witty. It's never irreverent, only adolescently naughty. Its message, presented with earnestness and care, is pretty simple and familiar, after all. And the music, by Stephen Schwartz -- he has done a smattering of rewriting --  is of the ilk that Broadway and only Broadway has ever thought of as rock. It's anthemic, rhythmically comforting, melodically on the saccharine side.</p>
        <p>That said, Mr. Rosza has done a nice job keeping the cast of 10 in peppy, perpetual motion and he has invented some clever gymnastics for them to suit the theater's small stage.</p>
        <p>The youthful cast members are a cheery, good-looking lot, and almost all of them can really sing, though they're disconcertingly wearing headset mikes to battle the four-man rock ensemble. I particularly liked Eliseo Roman, whose mellifluous tenor brought quiet life to the prayerful song ''All Good Gifts.''</p>
        <p>Interestingly, maybe purposely, the weakest voice belongs to Barrett Foa, who plays Jesus. He's a slight, blond young man with a killer smile and eyebrows that arch as if he's been exercising them; they're the kind of looks that are made to charm, and he does come across as a modern-day missionary, but I kept wondering whether he was supposed to be slightly untrustworthy or was just overacting.</p>
        <p>In any case, the whole is staged and performed with hyperbolic zeal, theatrical even more than spiritual, which is probably why the children in the audience I saw it with were kept so involved.</p>
        <p>Absent the Crucifixion, which closes the show on a discomforting downbeat note (it always has, of course), ''Godspell,'' with its energy and its jokey exhortations for people to behave well in the world, ends up creating an atmosphere that recalls nothing so much as ''The Muppet Show.''</p>
