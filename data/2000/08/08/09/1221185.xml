        <p>Perm, a Russian city in the Urals, is not a household name in the United States. But it has historical significance for ballet lovers throughout the world. From Perm, where he was born and grew up, Serge Diaghilev went on to found the Ballets Russes. Years later, at the end of World War II, came the establishment of the Perm Ballet Academy, considered the third major ballet school in Russia after those attached to the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow and the Kirov Ballet in St. Petersburg.</p>
        <p>Both companies have recruited major talent from the Perm Academy. Alumni include Nadezhda Pavlova, who became a Bolshoi star, and the Kirov's Olga Chenchikova and Lyubov Kunakova. Like their colleagues in the Perm Ballet, they were trained in a distinctive style that combined the Kirov's pure classicism and the Bolshoi's power.</p>
        <p>This fusion was rooted in the academy's history. The Perm Theater of Opera and Ballet had recruited dancers from a small school attached to the theater in 1926. But a lasting impact came from the sudden arrival of the Kirov Ballet in 1941, evacuated with its teachers from the besieged city of Leningrad.</p>
        <p>Yekaterina Geidenreikh, a colleague of the celebrated Kirov teacher Agrippina Vaganova, stayed on to become the revered and first director of the Perm Ballet Academy.</p>
        <p>It was established in 1945 as a state-subsidized boarding school: Aleksei Kosygin, the future prime minister, signed the decree.</p>
        <p>Although the Kirov returned home in 1944, the Leningrad influence was originally dominant at the school, which Geidenreikh directed until 1955. In later years the faculty recruited Moscow-trained teachers like Lyudmila Sakharova, the school's current director.</p>
        <p>The Perm Ballet, directed by Kirill Schmorgoner, draws dancers exclusively from its school. The dedication of the 250 students, aged 10 to 18, is sensed in these photographs. Despite cold winters, some 1,000 students from different cities apply each year to study not only ballet and academics but the pavanes of times past.</p>
