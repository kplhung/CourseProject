        <p>Editorial on planned Texas execution of Oliver David Cruz, who is mentally retarded, urges Gov George W Bush to block executions of mentally retarded convicts and urges Texas legislature to pass bill banning such executions</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>There are two executions scheduled in Texas this evening, but only one is being denounced by groups ranging from the American Bar Association to the European Union. That is because the condemned inmate Oliver David Cruz is mentally retarded, and it demeans the nation's judicial system to execute a person so mentally deficient.</p>
        <p>This page opposes the death penalty in all cases for both practical and moral reasons. But even among death penalty supporters, there is a growing recognition that executing the mentally retarded offends the most basic standards of justice. This is partly because the mentally retarded, though perhaps capable of distinguishing between right and wrong sufficiently to stand trial, cannot be said to be among the most morally culpable criminals, deserving the ultimate penalty. It is the same reason we do not execute those under the age of 16.</p>

        <p>There are two executions scheduled in Texas this evening, but only one is being denounced by groups ranging from the American Bar Association to the European Union. That is because the condemned inmate Oliver David Cruz is mentally retarded, and it demeans the nation's judicial system to execute a person so mentally deficient.</p>
        <p>This page opposes the death penalty in all cases for both practical and moral reasons. But even among death penalty supporters, there is a growing recognition that executing the mentally retarded offends the most basic standards of justice. This is partly because the mentally retarded, though perhaps capable of distinguishing between right and wrong sufficiently to stand trial, cannot be said to be among the most morally culpable criminals, deserving the ultimate penalty. It is the same reason we do not execute those under the age of 16.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that executing such minors and the insane violates the Constitution's Eighth Amendment, but has stopped short of holding the same for the mentally retarded. It did determine, however, that jurors must be instructed to weigh evidence of retardation as a possible mitigating factor at sentencing. On appeal a federal court held that the jury in the Cruz case was not properly instructed on this point, and it is on that legal argument that Mr. Cruz is hoping for an eleventh-hour reprieve from the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>In the last legislative session in Texas, the State Senate passed a bill that would have banned such executions. The bill, lacking the support of Gov. George W. Bush, then stalled in the House. But Governor Bush is out of step with the mainstream on this issue, as many states are rushing to ban the execution of the mentally retarded. His brother, Jeb, the Florida governor, supports such a ban.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush should take the truly compassionate step of using his clemency powers to ensure that no more mentally retarded convicts are executed in Texas. The legislature could then pass the bill banning such executions in its next session. Mr. Bush should not be embarrassed by efforts to improve the administration of justice in Texas. What he should be embarrassed by is the callous execution of the mentally impaired on his watch.</p>
