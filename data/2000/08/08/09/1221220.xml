        <p>Dorothy Onyango, a New York City attendance teacher with a distinct pigeon-toed gait, trudged past two addicts and up the stairs of an apartment building in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, to call on a 13-year-old truant who had missed six days of summer school.</p>
        <p>Others had unsuccessfully tried to enter the heavily locked building, but tracking down truants for 15 years has trained Mrs. Onyango to talk her way behind doors no one wants opened. Mrs. Onyango recalled that she had knocked on the apartment's front door and that the mother had invited her inside. But when she entered, the defiant teenager scampered into the bathroom and hid until Mrs. Onyango departed. The mother, a sickly former drug abuser, promised that her daughter would be at school the next day.</p>
        <p>Five weeks later, the girl had never shown up.</p>
        <p>The troubled teenager was among more than 130,000 students who skipped classes from the city's ambitious summer school program. It was up to attendance teachers like Mrs. Onyango to track them down. In doing so, the teachers shed light on the persistent social problems that explain why children do not go to school even when the penalty may mean repeating a grade.</p>
        <p>Some parents were too drugged out to force their children to go to school, according to interviews with several attendance teachers. In other cases, children wielded so much authority in the household that their parents did not challenge them when they refused to go to school. Often, limited-English-speaking parents did not understand phone calls or correspondence from the Board of Education informing them that their child was required to go.</p>
        <p>In many cases, parents made a deliberate decision to have their children spend time with family in their native Caribbean homes. And some teenagers said poverty or better opportunities prodded them to take summer jobs.</p>
        <p>''Some students play it off like they don't need summer school,'' said Yousef Hattar, a Manhattan high school attendance teacher. ''But we are still out there telling them they failed and that we aren't socially promoting.''</p>
        <p>The system has 300 attendance teachers who work during the school year, and 144 worked for the first time this summer to avoid last summer's embarrassments, when Rudy Crew, who was then the chancellor, did not learn until the summer was over that 25 percent of the students required to attend had not shown up.</p>
        <p>More than 300,000 students were registered for summer school classes, which ended last week, and about 200,000 were required to go or face repeating a grade. Forty percent of the mandated students in kindergarten through 12th grade did not show up for classes, according to attendance figures released in mid-July.</p>
        <p>While the rate of absenteeism for the third through eighth grades is about the same as last year, when the city ran a smaller program, expectations were higher this year, with the Board of Education and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani promising to end automatic promotion of students for all elementary and middle-school grades. The high truancy rate was so alarming that Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy made telephone calls alongside employees on a Sunday, urging parents to get their children to school.</p>
        <p>But phone calls will not always work. ''So many of our kids don't have phones, or the lines are disconnected, or they move without notifying the school that it is useless to call,'' said Steve Grossman, the union representative for attendance teachers.</p>
        <p>The job of attendance teacher, difficult during the school year, is doubly hard in the summer when truants are not only their usual defiant selves but in vacation mode.</p>
        <p>The attendance teachers do not command attention because they are not truly truant officers, who are New York City police officers patrolling the streets looking for truants. They also cannot compel students to go to summer school because it is not mandatory. But in the warm weather, they can cajole their way into buildings that would be hard to enter in the winter since people are out on the stoop taking in the air.</p>
        <p>The other day, Mrs. Onyango recalled, she made it up to the front door of the 13-year-old truant in Bedford-Stuyvesant simply by introducing herself to the menacing addicts on the stoop and asking them to open the building's main entrance. Surprisingly, one of them complied.</p>
        <p>With the door slamming hard behind her, she heard him say: ''She's going up there to get that girl. She didn't go to school all year. They're going to make her go to summer school.'' She smiled to herself, she said.</p>
        <p>''People are basically warm,'' she said. ''I'll go into a building and ask for someone and people will respond -- even people you think you're supposed to be afraid of. If they know you're from the Board of Education, they are not offensive.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Onyango is a stately 50-something woman who wears an Afro-puff at the center of her head. For 11 years, she has worked in the mostly black and Hispanic District 16 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, one of the city's poorest areas.</p>
        <p>Some school districts, like District 8 in Throgs Neck, the Bronx, had attendance teachers like Joanie Dikeman work evenings to reach parents who work. ''I've made about 150 home visits this summer,'' Ms. Dikeman said. ''If these kids don't go to summer school, I figure what chance do they have? It's worth it to me.''</p>
        <p>Most of Mr. Hattar's 1,200 cases this summer were students who were sick or who missed classes because of deaths in the family. But the ones that tug at his heart are the truants.</p>
        <p>One was a 17-year-old who told him she was going to get a high school equivalency diploma, he recalled. Just waking up from a noon nap, the teenager and her mother signed a letter that allowed her to withdraw from summer school.</p>
        <p>As he disappeared from the doorway of their apartment in a hulking public housing building in Lower Manhattan, he hoped that she would follow through with her plan.</p>
