        <p>The selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut for the Democratic ticket has prompted a barrage of anti-Semitic comments in online chat rooms and on Internet message boards, leading at least a few online services to start deleting  offensive postings.</p>
        <p>In the first hours after the news broke on Monday, chat rooms on America Online and Yahoo were peppered with slurs against Jews. At times, as many as half the comments included offensive remarks.</p>
        <p>On an AOL message board devoted to conversation about Mr. Lieberman, where more than 20,000 comments had been posted by yesterday afternoon, many included disparaging references to Jews. AOL monitors began removing offensive postings on Monday night.</p>
        <p>AOL officials would not say how many messages had been deleted. But they said they were prepared to suspend or cancel the accounts of those found to have violated the service's rules against hate speech, vulgar language or harassment.</p>
        <p>Message boards are like collections of open letters, available indefinitely to be read and responded to. Chat rooms are harder to monitor, because they are live discussions among perhaps a dozen computer users, and the comments vanish almost as quickly as they appear.</p>
        <p>Comments on Monday ranged from direct slurs against Mr. Lieberman to denials of the Holocaust. Some were in German. In a Yahoo chat room, a person who went by the name Young Nazi Girl declared Jews to be people with ''loyalty to no one but the dollar.'' In an AOL chat room, some visitors declared that Jews controlled and manipulated the government and the media.</p>
        <p>CNN.com banned 10 chat room visitors for offensive remarks related to Mr. Lieberman, said Edna Johnson, a CNN spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>On several services, the anti-Semitic vitriol in chat rooms appeared to have subsided yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Anti-Defamation League has been monitoring online activity since the Lieberman announcement and has seen a ''spike'' in anti-Semitic remarks on the Internet, said Abraham Foxman, the league's national director. Many were sent to e-mail lists devoted to discussion of white supremacy, Mr. Foxman said,</p>
        <p>Before the Internet, those people would not have been heard by most Americans, he said, but ''today, this goes globally to a million people.''</p>
        <p>Of course, online chat rooms are known as places where some people, shielded by anonymity, let ugly remarks fly. Message boards, where discussions are archived and therefore more traceable, may be slightly tamer, but still attract extremists.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Graham, a spokesman for AOL, said staff members and volunteers would ''aggressively pursue'' those found to have posted anti-Semitic comments. But Mr. Graham said the number violating AOL's rules was not abnormal, given the volume.</p>
        <p>When Elian Gonzalez was seized by federal agents, Mr. Graham said, more than 60,000 messages were posted within 20 minutes, with a similar proportion of violations.</p>
        <p>Still, staff members of groups like the Anti-Defamation League and the Simon Wiesenthal Center said the slurs against Jews in mainstream political chat rooms -- and not just on Web sites devoted to such causes -- showed that anti-Semites felt emboldened to reach out to a larger audience.</p>
        <p>''What they are able to do is piggyback on a news event,'' Mr. Foxman said. ''And therefore they get a certain legitimacy, a boost.''</p>
        <p>By yesterday, there were some signs that the anti-Jewish message would not travel far. Scores of people had logged on to message boards to balance the offensive remarks with declarations of their own disgust for anti-Semitism.</p>
        <p>''I cannot believe,'' wrote one AOL subscriber, ''that anyone in their right mind would write anything as hateful as I have read here.''</p>
