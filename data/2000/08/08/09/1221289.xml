        <p>The pros pect of peace in Kashmir  a flicker of hope that had burned unsteadily for the past two weeks -- appeared to die out completely today when the militant group Hizbul Mujahedeen called off its cease-fire.</p>
        <p>''This peace offensive has not been reciprocated by India, who have demonstrated their traditional intransigence,'' Syed Salahuddin, the organization's chief, said at a crowded news conference in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad.</p>
        <p>The group had insisted that Pakistan be allowed to join in any talks, something India refused to allow, alleging that Islamabad was guilty of sponsoring the ''cross-border terrorism'' that has made Kashmir one of the world's most violent places since 1989.</p>
        <p>Hizbul Mujahedeen, one of the main insurgent groups in the Himalayan territory, declared its unilateral, three-month cease-fire in a surprise announcement on July 24.</p>
        <p>India was receptive to the peace initiative, but the move drew immediate and harsh criticism from other militant groups whose leaders said Hizbul was off on a fool's errand. To make sure that errand failed, some of the guerrillas murdered more than 100 innocents -- many of them Hindu pilgrims -- during one bloody night last week.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Hizbul field commanders and Indian officials managed to hold a preliminary round of talks on Thursday in Kashmir's summer capital, Srinagar. They agreed to continue negotiations on setting terms for the cease-fire.</p>
        <p>But all optimism was quickly moderated when the Hizbul made another surprise announcement, this time an ultimatum: India had until today to agree on including Pakistan in any talks or the cease-fire was off.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee made several conciliatory statements about open-ended conditions for talks, but the inclusion of Pakistan was not among them.</p>
        <p>Hizbul made good on its threat. ''As the deadline has expired, we direct all the commanders with the mujahedeen in the field to break the cease-fire and go ahead with all target-oriented missions,'' Mr. Salahuddin said today.</p>
        <p>The Hizbul chief sounded defiant, but there will now surely be behind-the-scenes attempts to revive the peace process and, in replying to a question, Mr. Salahuddin said that his group might review its stance if India made necessary concessions.</p>
        <p>In its official reaction to today's events, the Indian government spared Hizbul its wrath and placed all blame on Pakistan: ''Pakistan's object has been to derail the peace process by seeking to involve itself as a party in discussions between India and the Hizbul Mujahedeen. The sabotage of the peace process by Pakistan clearly shows its callous disregard for the welfare of the people'' of Kashmir.</p>
        <p>Kashmir, a territory about the size of Utah with a population whose majority is Muslim, is wedged between India, Pakistan and China. Its ownership has been disputed between predominantly Muslim Pakistan and largely Hindu India since both gained independence in 1947. The two nations -- the world's newest nuclear powers -- have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir.</p>
        <p>In 1989, an insurgency broke out. Pakistan has backed many of the militant groups that have taken up arms -- some of whom favor an independent Kashmir, some of whom prefer annexation to Pakistan. The Indian military has attempted to crush the militancy, often using tactics condemned by human rights groups. An estimated 25,000 to 40,000 people have died during the decade of violence.</p>
