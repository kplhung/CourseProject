        <p>Editorial urges New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone to move swiftly to pass bill protecting civil rights of citizens who identify themselves as transgender; urges Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to sign it (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>People who have had sex-change surgery, cross-dressers and others whose gender identity does not conform to societal norms are often targets of violence and bias that force them to live in fear for their safety or the loss of their jobs and shelter. A bill now before the New York City Council would give this marginalized population basic protection against discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations.</p>
        <p>The city's human rights law has long barred discrimination based on gender. Since the 1980's, the law has also prohibited discrimination based on ''sexual orientation.'' But that provision focuses on issues of heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality. It does not protect those who identify themselves as transgender. The new legislation, which has 28 sponsors in the City Council, would broaden the definition of ''gender'' to include not only a person's sex, but also a person's expression of gender identity, self-image and appearance.</p>

        <p>The city's human rights law has long barred discrimination based on gender. Since the 1980's, the law has also prohibited discrimination based on ''sexual orientation.''

        <p>Similar anti-bias laws have been enacted in nearly two dozen cities, including Atlanta, San Francisco and Minneapolis. The proposed measure has strong support from civil rights groups and political leaders, including Public Advocate Mark Green and City Comptroller Alan Hevesi. Council Speaker Peter Vallone, however, has not taken a position on the measure. Mr. Vallone should move swiftly to get the bill passed, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani should sign the measure.</p>
