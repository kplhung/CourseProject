        <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers waited 11 games last season to bench quarterback Kordell Stewart. This time, it only took them until the end of the preseason.</p>
        <p>Coach Bill Cowher issued a terse three-paragraph statement yesterday saying that Kent Graham, who previously lost starting jobs with Arizona and the Giants, would start Sunday's season opener against Baltimore.</p>
        <p>''I'm just going to go out and play relaxed, because that's how I play the best,'' Graham said.</p>
        <p>The decision, revealed by Cowher to both quarterbacks Sunday night, obviously caught Stewart by surprise. Despite being benched for the final five games last season, Stewart began the preseason with the quarterback's job to lose.</p>
        <p>''I won't say I was shook up but was kind of stunned a little bit,'' Stewart said. ''At the same time, I understood.''</p>
        <p>Only 18 months after signing a $27 million contract extension, Stewart now faces an uncertain future with a team that felt it couldn't wait any longer for him to play his way out of a two-year slump.</p>
        <p>Stewart never discussed with Cowher returning to the Slash role -- part quarterback, part wide receiver -- he filled before becoming the Steelers' quarterback in 1997. He played some at receiver late last season after Mike Tomczak replaced him at quarterback.</p>
        <p>Graham was 31 of 57 for 334 yards, 3 touchdowns and 1 interception during a preseason in which he usually was paired with the veteran receivers Courtney Hawkins and Hines Ward. Stewart was 19 of 55 for 238 yards, a touchdown and 2 interceptions.</p>
