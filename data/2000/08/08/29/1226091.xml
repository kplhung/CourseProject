        <p>John McCain's unfortunate return bout with melanoma should serve as a wake-up call for the millions of Americans -- especially young Americans -- who still worship the sun, skimp on sunscreen and bare their skin to UV radiation to just within the limits of decency.</p>
        <p>It should also remind everyone of the importance of self-vigilance. Since no one knows your skin and its many markings better than you, you have primary responsibility for checking often for any changes that could herald skin cancer.</p>
        <p>Melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer, with the capacity to spread to and ultimately kill. It can recur years after treatment of a first melanoma, and, as seems to have happened to Mr. McCain, new melanomas can develop at any time after an original melanoma is seemingly cured.</p>
        <p>Now in the United States, the incidence of melanoma is rising at an exponential rate: 4 percent a year for 20 years, accompanied by an increase of nearly 2 percent a year in melanoma deaths. One person in 74 can now expect to develop melanoma at some point, up from one in 1,500 in 1935 and one in 250 two decades ago.</p>
        <p>This year, doctors are expected to diagnosis invasive malignant melanoma in 47,700 people and melanoma still in an early noninvasive stage in up to 40,000 people. Melanoma will kill an estimated 7,700 people in this country this year, many of them in the prime of life.</p>
        <p>You see, melanoma is a cancer that afflicts the young and old. A quarter of new cases now occur in people younger than 40, and half of all cases occur in people younger than 54.</p>
        <p>Melanoma is the leading cancer in women in their late 20's and second only to breast cancer among women in their early 30's. In terms of years of life lost to cancer, melanoma ranks second only to adult leukemia.</p>
        <p>Protection and Prevention</p>
        <p>Have I scared you into action? I hope so. Let's start with what we know about preventing this disease. Melanomas can sometimes occur on parts of the body like the soles of the feet and palms of the hands, that are not routinely exposed to the sun. But 95 percent of cases occur on sun-exposed parts of the body, especially the head and neck, upper back and, particularly in women, the legs. Back in the days of long skirts, women rarely, if ever, got melanoma on their legs.</p>
        <p>Certain circumstances can render a person especially susceptible to melanoma. These include having suffered three or more blistering sunburns before age 20, repeated exposure to UV light in a tanning salon, having worked three or more summers as a teenager at an outdoor job, having many moles that change in appearance, prior treatment with psoralen and UV light for psoriasis and a history of melanoma in a parent or sibling.</p>
        <p>Fair-skinned people, especially those with blond or red hair, blue or green eyes, lots of freckles on the upper back and an inability to tan, are also at much greater than average risk of developing melanoma (as well as superficial skin cancers).</p>
        <p>People who have had several precancers of the skin (actinic keratoses) are also at greater than average risk. Having three or more of the above factors raises a person's risk of developing melanoma 30-fold.</p>
        <p>Bursts of sun exposure seem to be more of a problem than continuous sun. People with outdoor jobs are less likely to develop melanoma than indoor workers who experience intense sun exposure on their days off.</p>
        <p>You may have heard a report that sunscreens do not protect against melanoma. That is not entirely true. In Australia and Hawaii, where three-quarters or more of the people now regularly use sunscreen, the melanoma rate has begun to fall.</p>
        <p>But until two years ago, most sunscreens contained agents that reduced the risk of sunburn from ultraviolet-B rays, which allowed people to stay in the sun and remain exposed to skin-damaging ultraviolet-A rays far longer than they otherwise might have.</p>
        <p>The S.P.F. (sun protection factor) rating of sunscreens refers only to a product's ability protect against sunburn, and most people apply too little sunscreen too infrequently to glean anything like the level of protection stated on the package. Toss out the old products and replace them with a new sunscreen that offers both UV-A and UV-B protection; these contain either Parsol 1789 or micronized zinc or titanium oxide.</p>
        <p>Anyway, sunscreen is considered a secondary measure to be relied upon when sun exposure cannot be avoided, for example, while swimming or playing tennis. Primary protection against sun damage comes from staying out of the sun, especially at midday and wearing protective clothing for prolonged exposure.</p>
        <p>I have invested in three shirts that have sun-blocking properties even when wet. They are not cheap -- about $60 or $70 each -- but I consider them an insurance policy. I wear them while hiking, kayaking and snorkeling. Also available are sun-protective hats, pants and skirts.</p>
        <p>Early Detection Is Crucial</p>
        <p>When melanoma is detected and treated in its early stages, the cure rate approaches 100 percent (although this is no guarantee that new melanomas won't develop later on). In more advanced stages, the fatality rate exceeds 70 percent. Regular full-body examinations for signs of trouble are important for everyone, since most melanomas occur in people not considered at high risk.</p>
        <p>Self-examination for suspicious skin lesions starts with stripping to the buff. Then stand in a well-lighted room in front of a full-length mirror, using a hand mirror to facilitate views of your sides, underarms, back and buttocks. Don't forget to check your scalp, toes and soles of your feet. If you lack a long mirror or for other reasons cannot do a complete exam on your own, ask for help from a spouse, significant other or good friend.</p>
        <p>What are you looking for? First, any lesion -- pigmented or not -- that seems to have changed in size or shape since your last self-exam. Hallmarks of an early, curable melanoma follow an ''ABCD'' guideline: A for an asymmetrical appearance, B for an irregular border, C for color variations of black and light and dark brown (or even pink, red, white or blue) and D for a diameter greater than a quarter of an inch. Some experts now add an E for enlargement, that is, a mole that is growing in height or width. Look, too, for any change in the surface or texture of a mole and for changes in sensation, like itching, tenderness or pain.</p>
        <p>Self-exams for possible skin cancer should be done monthly, and at the very least, every three months. If you see your doctor once a year, have the doctor perform a full-body check as well. Report any suspicious lesion you find to your physician, preferably to a dermatologist who specializes in skin cancer. And if your doctor refers you to a specialist for a more detailed exam or biopsy, act promptly; delaying treatment can result in a more serious and less curable cancer, if that is what you have.</p>
        <p>You may also consult an excellent book on melanoma and other skin cancers, ''Saving Your Skin'' by Dr. Barney Kenet and Patricia Lawler, published in 1994.</p>
