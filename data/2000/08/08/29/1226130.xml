        <p>In closing a case that has led to outrage among environmental groups around the world, a district judge in the state of Guerrero sentenced Rudolfo Montiel Flores today to almost seven years in prison for drugs and weapons crimes.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups consider Mr. Montiel, 44, a political prisoner, saying his only crime was to organize protests against loggers who were cutting forests around his village north of Acapulco.</p>
        <p>Last year, gunmen killed several members of rural ecological group led by Mr. Montiel. In May 1999, Mr. Montiel said that he was detained and tortured by soldiers who forced him to sign statements that confessed to marijuana cultivation and possession of illegal arms.</p>
        <p>This summer, the Mexican National Human Rights Commission said that his rights had been violated, that evidence against him had been planted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montiel, a poor indigenous farmer, was arrested and convicted with a friend, Teodoro Cabrera Garcia, who was sentenced today to 10 years in prison.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the men pledged to appeal the sentences and to help organize protests to reignite interest in the case.</p>
        <p>Leaders of Amnesty International in Mexico City said they would urge President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada to dismiss the sentences against the two men after he takes office in December.</p>
