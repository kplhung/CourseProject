        <p>Prosecutors investigating the 1998 police shooting at the center of New Jersey's racial profiling scandal were granted two more months by a judge today to examine new eyewitness testimony and determine how it might alter their case.</p>
        <p>The state troopers involved in the shooting, James Kenna and John Hogan, are awaiting trial on attempted murder charges for firing 11 shots at a van during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in April 1998 and wounding two black men and one Hispanic man, all unarmed.</p>
        <p>The case was thrown into turmoil this month when two new eyewitnesses came forward and gave statements that reportedly corroborated some elements of the troopers' version of the incident.</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers have argued that the troopers fired in self-defense, and they filed motions asking that the charges be dropped. A hearing on the new evidence had been scheduled for Thursday.</p>
        <p>A special deputy attorney general,  James J. Gerrow, asked Judge Andrew J. Smithson of Superior Court today for two more months to respond to the defense's motion to dismiss, saying that the new evidence had forced prosecutors to reconsider their approach to the case.</p>
        <p>''We need more time to continue our investigation and also to really evaluate what our response is going to be,'' Mr. Gerrow said.</p>
        <p>Judge Smithson granted a delay until Oct. 26, and is expected to decide whether to dismiss the charges at a hearing scheduled for Oct. 31.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerrow has refused to discuss what the evidence is or how it may affect the case against the two troopers.</p>
        <p>Jack Arsenault, Mr. Kenna's lawyer, said the defense has not yet been provided details about the new evidence.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Arsenault said he believed the new witnesses' testimony might bolster the troopers' assertion that they fired only after the van backed toward them and knocked officer Hogan to the ground.</p>
        <p>''These two new witnesses really seem to corroborate more of what the troopers said'' than the prosecutors expected, Mr. Arsenault said.  ''It's given them much more of a perspective on the case.''</p>
        <p>The shooting sparked a political uproar from civil rights activists, who had complained for years that troopers were singling out black and Hispanic drivers for traffic stops. After an investigation by the New Jersey Attorney General's Office and the federal Justice Department, the state signed a consent decree in which it agreed to stop the practice.</p>
