        <p>Representative Rick A.

        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, has released a 30-second advertisement, ''Positive,'' that emphasizes the tit-for-tat advertising campaigns that have been waged in recent weeks over his legislative record. This new advertisement, which is to begin appearing statewide today, responds to a recent one by his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, that questioned his effectiveness as a legislator. That Clinton advertisement was itself a response to a Lazio commercial that promoted bills Mr. Lazio supported or sponsored.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- The Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Snapshots of Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton appear at the top of the screen, with images from their past commercials running underneath. At the bottom of the screen under Mr. Lazio's side is the word ''positive'' in blue, and under Mrs. Clinton's side is the word ''negative'' in red. As it progresses, graphics highlight Mr. Lazio's votes on Medicare and prescription drug benefits, with citations from the Congressional Record. The commercial's final words appear as white text on a black screen.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''Compare: Congressman Rick Lazio is running a positive campaign about his accomplishments for New York. Hillary Clinton is running a negative campaign because she has done nothing for New York. Her new ad contains five gross distortions in just 30 seconds. Rick Lazio has voted to support Medicare and for prescription drugs. Look it up. It's all there in the Congressional Record. Hillary Clinton. You just can't trust her.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- It accuses Mrs. Clinton's advertisement of making five errors, but only emphasizes two. Mr. Lazio's aides said he supported Medicare by voting for a resolution last year that called for providing Medicare an extra $11 billion from the federal budget surplus. His aides also say he supported a Republican plan to subsidize prescription drugs for the elderly poor that was less generous than one sponsored by Democrats. As for the statement, ''Hillary Clinton is running a negative campaign because she has done nothing for New York,'' Mrs. Clinton's aides say  she has been a quiet force behind several bills supported by the president that benefited people across the country. And Mr. Lazio has done his share of negative campaigning, starting with his nomination acceptance speech laced with harsh criticism of her. He has distributed a pointed fund-raising letter that questioned Mrs. Clinton's integrity, and at virtually every one of his stops on his three statewide bus tours he has played a snippet from a Ray Charles song with the lyric, ''Tell your mama, tell your pa. I'm gonna send you back to Arkansas. You don't do right.''</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Calling the ad ''Positive'' raises the art of spin to new levels. It attacks in response to an attack; the closing line: ''Hillary Clinton. You just can't trust her,'' says it all. It will probably be effective, though, in allaying concerns among the elderly that Mr. Lazio is not on their side. And it will instruct viewers not to take Mrs. Clinton's claims, or for that matter Mr. Lazio's, at face value. Mr. Lazio has said he will continue to make trust, an indirect reference to the White House scandals, a theme.</p>
