        <p>Now that the Mets have caught the Braves, what do they do? Do they storm on by, or do they act like the race dog that catches the mechanical rabbit and goes crazy?</p>
        <p>For the moment at least, the Mets are playing it cool.</p>
        <p>''I don't know that it's all that important except we won tonight,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said when asked what it means to be in first place. ''At the end of the season it means you're in first place. You win your division. Last time I checked we're not even in the last month.''</p>
        <p>The Mets moved into a tie for first with Atlanta last night on the strength of their 4-2 victory over the Astros and the Braves' 6-3 loss to the Reds, but the manager and his players tried to act as if they didn't even notice. Nobody grabbed the rabbit by the neck and started shaking it.</p>
        <p>First place has been an ephemeral concept for the Mets in recent seasons. If they've been there at all, they haven't been there for long.</p>
        <p>As they began the game with the Astros at Shea Stadium, they hadn't really been in first place this season. Oh, there was that day in April when the Mets had two victories and a loss and it was the best record in the National League East. But division championships aren't awarded on the basis of three games.</p>
        <p>They were in first place much later in the season last year but only briefly. The division lead was theirs after games of Aug. 3 through Aug. 8 and again after games of Aug. 18 through Aug. 21. In between they were tied for first for five days in a six-day stretch. But after they lost the second game of a doubleheader to St. Louis Aug. 22, they saw first place no more.</p>
        <p>Now it is later in August, and they are tied for first because they have won 24 of their past 33 games while the Braves have won 16 of their past 30, squandering a six-and-a-half-game lead in the process.</p>
        <p>This is the team the Mets couldn't catch and keep caught last year, when they reached the playoffs as the wild-card team, and the team they couldn't catch the year before, when they squandered their opportunity to be the wild-card team by losing their last five games of the season, the last three to the Braves. The Braves were also the team the Mets lost to in the league championship series last year.</p>
        <p>It's always the Braves. No matter who has challenged for the N.L. East title in the past decade, it is the Braves who deterred them.</p>
        <p>''They've had their way with us the last couple years,'' John Franco said yesterday. ''They're the Yankees of the National League. They're the team to beat.''</p>
        <p>But now with 31 games remaining, the Mets have the same number of victories, 78, and losses, 53, as the Braves.</p>
        <p>What does first place mean to the Mets now?</p>
        <p>''Not that much at this point,'' Al Leiter said. ''On Oct. 1 it's different.''</p>
        <p>Being in first place, Todd Zeile said, looks good in the newspapers, but he added: ''It means something on Oct. 1. Right now it's just confirmation that you're playing good baseball. Right now that's all that matters. We feel like we're playing good baseball. For the longest time we were playing good ball and we couldn't gain on the Braves. Now people are saying, 'They're playing good ball and they're gaining on the Braves.' The point is we're still playing good ball.''</p>
        <p>The Mets played well enough in the first inning last night, scoring three runs on two singles and a home run by Edgardo Alfonzo. Glendon Rusch, continuing a remarkable run as a starter, pitched seven strong innings, and Turk Wendell protected the lead with two innings of shutout relief. Mike Piazza didn't even play.</p>
        <p>''It's almost like last year,'' said Franco, who was unavailable to pitch because of a sore muscle near his shoulder. ''We had a pretty good second half and September, we kind of fell flat on our faces a little bit. Hopefully this year we won't repeat what we did last year.''</p>
        <p>Wendell, his first save of the season secured, talked about his performance but was also asked the inevitable question about first place.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't mean anything right now,'' he said, adopting the company line. ''It means something Oct. 1.''</p>
        <p>But he conceded: ''I've always said it's better to be the hunted than the hunter when it comes to stuff like this. It's nice to know people are chasing you. But there's still a lot of baseball to be played. You can't get excited about the standings. You just have to worry about one game at a time.''</p>
        <p>And then Wendell walked to the couch on one side of the bank of four television sets and sat down to watch the Braves' half of the ninth inning. Franco was sitting on the couch on the other side. No other player was visible. Many of them, it turned out, were in the clubhouse lounge, which just happened to have a television set, too.</p>
        <p>With one out and the Reds leading, 6-2, Brian Jordan was called out on a close play at first base. ''If it was 3-2, they would've called him safe,'' said Wendell, one of the Mets who weren't concerned about first place. Minutes later, Walt Weiss hit a fly to center field for the final out. At 10:07 p.m. the Mets were tied for first place.</p>
        <p>Before the clock turned to 10:08, a mass of players emerged from the lounge. But first place doesn't mean anything until Oct. 1.</p>
