        <p>President Clinton had hoped to witness the signing of a major peace deal and cease-fire among the warring factions in Burundi, but negotiations to end the country's seven-year civil war bogged down today when some Tutsi minority parties refused to sign an accord with the Hutu majority.</p>
        <p>Former South African President Nelson Mandela, who is brokering the peace talks, delivered a blistering attack on the Tutsi parties for backing out of an agreement and turning their backs on ''the slaughter of innocent people inside Burundi.'' Mr. Mandela had invited Mr. Clinton and leaders from about a dozen African nations to the resort town of Arusha for the signing by Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated government.</p>
        <p>But when it became clear that a major agreement would not be reached by today's deadline, Mr. Clinton instead used the occasion to plead for peace among the Tutsi and Hutu.</p>
        <p>''If you don't do it, what is the price?'' the president asked. ''If you don't do it, what is the chance that the progress you have made will unravel? If you come back in 5 to 10 years, will the issues change? The gulf between you will not narrow, but the gulf between Burundi and the rest of the world will grow greater if you let this moment slip away.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton winds up a four-day trip to Africa early Tuesday morning after a meeting in Cairo with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak. Mr. Clinton, eager for lasting foreign policy achievements in the final five months of his presidency, is struggling to build support among Arabs for a breakthrough deal between the Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
        <p>The peace accord for Burundi that Mr. Mandela has been promoting during the last two years calls for an eventual return of power to the Hutu majority -- who make up nearly 85 percent of the population -- but with guaranteed protections for the Tutsi. Today's agreement, signed by only some of the parties, fell considerably short of even an end to hostilities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mandela criticized the Burundi president, Pierre Buyoya, in particular, for denying that he is holding political prisoners, who Mr. Mandela said are being ''treated worse than animals'' in Burundi jails.</p>
        <p>Complicating the talks is the sheer number of parties involved -- 19 in all. They include 10 Tutsi political parties, 7 Hutu parties, the Tutsi-dominated army and the Burundi government. Two significant Hutu rebel groups are boycotting the talks.</p>
        <p>''No one can force peace,'' Mr. Clinton told the Burundians.''You must choose it.''</p>
        <p>The civil war in Burundi, which has claimed 200,000 lives and forced more than a million people from their homes, dates to 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the first president from the Hutu majority, Melchior Ndadaye. Ethnic violence between the Tutsi and Hutu has flared in Burundi since it won independence from Belgium in 1962.</p>
        <p>On the first trip by a United States president to Tanzania, Mr. Clinton told a welcoming party at the airport that ''we still share your sorrow'' over the 1998 terrorist bombing of the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam.</p>
        <p>''I believe the terrorists went after Tanzania, Kenya and the United States precisely because we are dedicated to tolerance, understanding and cooperation across frontiers and lines of division,'' he said. ''They took a lot of our loved ones, but they failed utterly to deter us from advancing our common principles.''</p>
        <p>Tens of thousands of people gathered along the highway waving green tree branches and flags at Mr. Clinton's passing motorcade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton signed an agreement with President Benjamin W. Mkapa of Tanzania that will give airlines in each country access to airports in the other, an ''open skies agreement'' that officials hope will increase passenger travel and commerce between the two nations.</p>
        <p>In brief remarks, Mr. Clinton said that Tanzania should be thankful it has avoided many of the crises that have focused the world's attention on other parts of Africa.</p>
        <p>''Because you have avoided headlines about repression, famine and war, and instead focused on the steady progress of democracy and development, being generous to your neighbors, and being a cause of peace and cooperation across the region, too many people in our country do not know enough about your country,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
