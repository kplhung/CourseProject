        <p>New Use for Lard</p>
        <p>When it comes to making a flaky pie crust, home cooks of a certain generation know that there's nothing quite like lard.</p>
        <p>Researchers at Pennsylvania State University have learned that when it comes to firing up an industrial boiler, there's nothing quite like lard either. They found that lard, along with inedible fat from the pig -- a substance with the delectable name of choice white grease -- can be used to replace No. 6 fuel oil.</p>
        <p>The researchers, at the university's Energy Institute, worked with a regional meat packer that processes 7,000 hogs a day. Needless to say, that makes for a lot of lard, which the processor sells as animal feed (by the tanker-truckload to veal producers) or as human feed (by the drum- or tub-load to bakeries and restaurants). The processor was concerned about what would happen if these markets for lard were to dry up.</p>
        <p>The researchers showed that lard and choice white grease could be burned in a boiler that normally runs on No. 6 oil (which is heavier than the oil used in home furnaces) with little or no need to modify the equipment. They found that gallon for gallon, the pork fat produces slightly less energy than oil, but it burns cleaner. (Although lard is a solid at room temperature, boilers that burn No. 6 oil generally heat the oil first to about 120 degrees, which is high enough to melt the fat.)</p>
        <p>Currently, lard and choice white grease sell for more than fuel oil. But should that change, the meat processor, which has several boilers at its main plant, might have another option -- to keep the home fires burning with its own byproducts.</p>
        <p>Inside Crocodile Hearts</p>
        <p>The typical car motor has a simple valve that keeps the engine coolant running through the radiator, cooling it down. It works this way unless the engine is cold, in which case the valve shunts the water away from the radiator, keeping it circulating around the engine until things warm up.</p>
        <p>Crocodiles, it turns out, have a special heart valve, called a cog-tooth valve, that works in somewhat the same way. Under certain conditions it shunts blood away from the lungs, keeping it circulating around the body.</p>
        <p>The cog-tooth valve is apparently found in all crocodiles, and had long puzzled scientists as to its function. Researchers in Sweden and Australia, examining a type of crocodile found in Australia and Papua New Guinea, were finally able to determine what the valve does. Their work is reported in the journal Nature.</p>
        <p>Most heart valves act passively, allowing the blood to flow in one direction while the heart is pumping and preventing it from backing up while the heart is at rest. The cog-tooth valve has a more active role, and the researchers found that its function is affected by adrenaline and similar hormones. The researchers suggest that the valve helps crocodiles extend the amount of time they spend underwater, in effect rationing the oxygen in the blood so that vital organs continue to get nourishment.</p>
        <p>Tracking Space Dust</p>
        <p>It's a fact of life in the aerospace business -- rockets occasionally blow up. When an explosion happens on the launching pad or soon after liftoff, it is a spectacular, costly and potentially life-threatening event.</p>
        <p>But rockets can also explode in space, and that can create problems of a different sort. Last March, leftover propellant caused the upper stage of a Chinese rocket to explode, spewing a cloud of ultrasmall debris particles that has the potential to damage other spacecraft and satellites.</p>
        <p>Now, a space-dust experiment  has detected debris from the Chinese rocket. The experiment, run by scientists from the University of Chicago, records the impact of the orbital dust and debris coming into contact with a collector device. This is the first time that space dust impacts have been tied to destruction of a spacecraft or satellite, and the results should help in planning how to keep satellites away from damaging debris.</p>
