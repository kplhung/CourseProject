        <p>A newborn boy was found abandoned on a subway platform at 14th Street in Manhattan last night, the police said.</p>
        <p>A subway passenger found the baby on the southbound platform of the A, C and E trains, which run along Eighth Avenue, around 8:30 p.m., the police said.</p>
        <p>''I glanced down and saw what I thought was just a baby doll,'' the passenger, Danny Stewart, told Channel 11 News. ''His upper body and his head were wrapped in a dark sweatshirt. But as I started to go up the stairs, he started to move, so I knew he was alive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stewart called 911 from a pay phone, then ran back to the platform to baby-sit until the police came and took the boy to St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center, the police said.</p>
        <p>The boy is in good health, said John Re, an administrator at the hospital. Doctors believe he was probably born yesterday, Mr. Re said.</p>
        <p>The police are searching for the baby's mother.</p>
