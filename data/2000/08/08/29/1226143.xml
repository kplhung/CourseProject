        <p>Stepping up the competition to define a standard format for electronic publishing, Microsoft and Adobe Systems both announced rival alliances intended to strengthen their respective positions in the growing market.</p>
        <p>The companies produce competing software programs intended to make reading on a screen easier on the eyes.</p>
        <p>Microsoft announced a plan for Amazon.com to open an electronic book store on its Web site that would distribute free copies of Microsoft's Reader software. Amazon.com will make Microsoft's format the site's ''preferred'' format for electronic books, said Lyn Blake, general manager of bookselling at Amazon.com.</p>
        <p>Ms. Blake said the site would begin selling electronic books for a variety of formats, including Adobe's, but Microsoft's format would appear first when customers searched for a title in electronic form. She said that Microsoft's software would probably also be promoted elsewhere on the site as well. Ms. Blake said Amazon would begin selling electronic books ''soon,'' but declined to specify.</p>
        <p>Dick Brass, vice president for technology development for Microsoft, called the alliance with Amazon.com ''a great vote of confidence in what is becoming a very competitive market.'' Amazon.com is the largest online bookstore with 23 million customers, and its support will bolster adoption of Microsoft's format over that of rivals, he said.</p>
        <p>Microsoft makes no money from its Reader software but receives an undisclosed ''single digit'' commission on the sale of electronic books for its software format.</p>
        <p>Three weeks ago, Microsoft started a similar cooperative marketing venture with Barnesandnoble.com, the second-largest online bookseller, with about six million customers, to coincide with the release of the new version of its Reader software.</p>
        <p>Microsoft had initially approached Amazon.com about participating in the release of its software, its first version for use on personal computers as well as hand-held devices. But Amazon.com passed then. Mr. Brass said more than 500,000 copies of the new software had been downloaded in the three weeks since it became available.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Adobe Systems, whose software for electronic publishing and reading on screen is currently the most widely used, agreed to buy Glassbook, a smaller maker of software for reading on screen. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Glassbook also provides digital book distribution services to publishers and others. Glassbook software is easier to read and to use than Adobe's, and the two companies said they planned to combine Glassbook technology in upgrades of Adobe's software.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Adobe said that customers had downloaded over 180 million copies of its free software for reading.</p>
        <p>The deal leaves three main rivals in the race to become the dominant format for electronic publishing: Microsoft, Adobe and Gemstar. Gemstar's format is used on portable appliances, like the Rocket e-book, instead of a laptop or desktop computer.</p>
