        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton may have succeeded in pressuring Representative Rick A. Lazio to disclose his tax returns, but the episode could prove embarrassing to her fellow Democrat running for the Senate: Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>As of today, Mr. Corzine is the only Senate candidate on either side of the Hudson who has yet to release his tax returns, and his Republican opponent, Representative Robert D. Franks, quickly seized the opportunity created by Mr. Lazio's reversal.</p>
        <p>''Mrs. Clinton has been an outspoken advocate for full financial disclosure, and hopefully she will be able to convince her Democratic colleague, Jon Corzine, to follow her lead,'' Mr. Franks said in a statement this afternoon. ''So far, no one in this state has had much luck in getting Mr. Corzine to tell us where his money comes from.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine has released abbreviated abstracts of his earnings and taxes paid in three recent years. But he has refused to release his returns, saying that doing so would violate a confidentiality agreement he signed with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, the investment bank he headed until his retirement last year.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corzine is coming under increasing pressure from both the local and national news media to relent. And in a July poll by the Gannett New Jersey Newspaper Group, 72 percent of respondents said Senate candidates should disclose the sources of their income, and 64 percent said Senate candidates should release their tax returns.</p>
        <p>''He's got a choice here,'' Mr. Franks's campaign manager, Charlie Smith, said of Mr. Corzine. ''He can either run for the United States Senate and try to earn the trust of the voters, or he can remain a businessman and continue to have secret business dealings. He's chosen to run for the U.S. Senate. There's an obligation to be forthcoming with the residents he hopes to represent. You can't have it both ways.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's spokesman, Tom Shea, said the candidate intended to place his assets in a blind trust if he is elected, rather than violate the confidentiality agreement, which Mr. Corzine considers a binding contract.</p>
        <p>''He's released everything he can, and everything that's required of him by the Senate Ethics Committee,'' Mr. Shea said. ''But he's kept his word on that contract, and he'll keep his word to the voters of New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, who remains less known and is looking for publicity, has invoked Mrs. Clinton's name often recently, but not in such a positive light. In July, he sent out fund-raising appeals saying Mrs. Clinton was one of the liberals ''New Jersey can't afford.''</p>
        <p>Her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, dismissed Mr. Franks's appeal as a campaign stunt. ''Where was Bob Franks when Rick Lazio was delaying releasing his tax returns for three months?'' he said.</p>
