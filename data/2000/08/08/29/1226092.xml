        <p>A recent study in India suggests that breast-feeding alone may not provide enough sustenance to babies in the developing nations when their mothers are severely malnourished.</p>
        <p>The report adds fuel to a debate about a decade-old campaign by the World Health Organization and other United Nations agencies that advocate an exclusive reliance on breast milk for the first six months of life.</p>
        <p>The study -- an Indian National Family Health Survey report titled ''Are W.H.O. Guidelines on Breast-Feeding Appropriate for India?'' -- concludes that babies can and should be given supplementary liquids or soft foods as young as 2 or 3 months to overcome the deficiencies in the milk of a malnourished mother.</p>
        <p>The new survey drew immediate criticism from officials from the World Health Organization and Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund. Both groups say that breast-feeding provides the safest, most health-giving nourishment, providing antibodies against diarrheal disease and eliminating risks posed by contaminants often introduced into baby formula or other supplements through the use of dirty water.</p>
        <p>Questions about breast-feeding in the developing world have arisen because of AIDS, with studies still assessing the possible transmission from mother to baby of the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
        <p>The World Health Organization's guidelines say that breast-feeding should begin immediately after birth and that infants should receive no other food until they are 4 to 6 months old, when supplements may be added to provide additional nutrients. Breast-feeding, in combination with other foods, is recommended until a child is at least 2 years old.</p>
        <p>In India, with a population of 1 billion, decades of maternal health programs have failed to dent significantly the high incidence of malnourishment among children, according to the World Bank, which says that more than half the children under 4 in India are severely malnourished and 60 percent of mothers are anemic. Put another way, 40 percent of all the world's malnourished children are Indian. Infant mortality in India is still high, at 79 for every 1,000 births.</p>
        <p>In May, the new survey on the role of breast-feeding in nutrition and mortality was published jointly by a state demographer from South India and a specialist in population and health studies from the East-West Center in Honolulu.</p>
        <p>The report looked at breast-feeding practices measured against not only infant mortality statistics but also social and economic factors in the lives of the mothers in three groups of high-mortality, medium-mortality and low-mortality Indian states. Breast-feeding is the norm everywhere in India and usually continues beyond infancy, providing a common backdrop for the survey.</p>
        <p>While the authors -- Ravilla Anandaiah, demographer for the Tamil Nadu directorate of family welfare, and Minja Kim Choe, a senior fellow at the East-West Center -- did not dispute the value of breast-feeding, they wrote that the purpose of their survey was ''to shed light on how infant survival in India can be improved by modifying infant-feeding practices and to evaluate the appropriateness of the W.H.O. guidelines for breast-feeding -- especially the guideline recommending exclusive breast-feeding up to 4 to 6 months.''</p>
        <p>The authors surveyed mothers of children born in the previous four years, asking them at how many months a baby was regularly given plain water, other milk, other liquids or solids or mushy food.</p>
        <p>They found that almost everywhere, babies were being given supplementary liquids or solids at an age lower than international health officials had recommended, and that the food was apparently safe because the presence of supplementary food was not related to higher death rates. Advocates of only breast-feeding say that the risk of contamination, particularly by dirty water, rises when other foods are introduced.</p>
        <p>The new survey found that in all mortality groups, both exclusive and nonexclusive breast-feeding seemed to lower mortality rates in the early months. But the benefits of exclusive breast-feeding dropped for older infants, the authors concluded, because ''children's nutritional needs are not met completely by mother's milk after the first few months of infancy.''</p>
        <p>By 3 to 6 months in states with high mortality rates, the survey says, ''mortality is higher among those who are breast-fed exclusively.'' In these high-risk states -- Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh -- ''breast-feeding with supplements has the most beneficial effect on child survival.'' Mothers who breast-fed exclusively were the poorest, most illiterate and likely to be the most malnourished.</p>
