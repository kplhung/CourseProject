        <p>The former Giants cornerback Phillippi Sparks, who was talked out of retirement by his best friend, Dallas cornerback Darren Woodson, signed a two-year, incentive-laden contract with the Cowboys yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Cowboys signed Sparks as insurance for the rookie Kareem Larrimore.</p>
        <p>The Giants had not been unhappy to see Sparks retire. He was not popular in the locker room, and the team did not want to meet his contract demands as a free agent. But with the Giants' secondary now extremely thin, the team could have used Sparks. One Giants coach said he was disappointed that Sparks chose to play for Dallas instead of the Giants.</p>
        <p>Sparks had told the Giants that he no longer wanted to play football and he spurned other offers. He chose the Cowboys because of Woodson, a teammate of his at Arizona State.</p>
