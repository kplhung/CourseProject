        <p>The Lycee Francais de New York, the prestigious school that attracts Europeans and American Francophiles, is selling all six of its buildings on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>The school expects to sell the buildings to wealthy people who want to restore them to single-family homes. And the school hopes to make big profit, more than $100 million, on the sale, enough to create an endowment and build a new school.</p>
        <p>Once considered too costly for private use, town houses are making a comeback as private residences in a new era of opulence that has left investment bankers, Internet entrepreneurs and investors flush with cash from the longest economic boom in history.</p>
        <p>Many people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford Manhattan's skyrocketing housing prices, but it appears that there is no limit to what some well-heeled buyers will pay to restore the wood-paneled libraries, grand staircases, marble fireplaces and bedrooms of the fancy old houses, which had been carved into apartments, retail stores, museums and school buildings during  the last 70 years. And with names like Vanderbilt, Gould, Pulitzer and McKim, Mead &amp; White embedded in the schools buildings, brokers expect a rash of bidders.</p>
        <p>''Many of these properties are going to be bought by private individuals, Wall Street money,'' said Jed Garfield, a broker at Leslie J. Garfield &amp; Company, which specializes in town house sales. ''There's no question that the dollars in private purchasers' pockets today are deeper than those of the institutions. It's an end of an era for some of these institutional buildings.''</p>
        <p>In the first six months of this year, the average price for a town house on the West Side climbed 34 percent to $2.9 million. During the same period, houses on the Upper East Side sold for $4.4 million, or $814 a square foot, up 19 percent from a year ago, according to the Corcoran Group. In contrast, the average price of a condominium on the Upper East Side is $673 a square foot.</p>
        <p>Although it is rare that six houses would come on the market at once, real estate brokers said that the school's portfolio was not expected to dampen prices, because there are so few buildings available.</p>
        <p>In June, an investment banker who took early retirement from Goldman Sachs paid $5 million for the town house at 25 East 92nd Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues. The house had been divided into five condominiums. The buyer plans to knock down the walls and make a home for his family.</p>
        <p>Last month, Benny Shabtai, president of Raymond Weil-Seville Watch Corporation, paid $8.2 million for the town house at 870 Park Avenue, between 77th and 78th Streets. The house has a three-story atrium, fireplaces, a library and a spiral staircase leading to five bedrooms.</p>
        <p>This year, the architect Emilio Ambasz put a $23 million price tag on his five-story Beaux-Arts house at 8 East 62nd Street, near Fifth Avenue. He bought it eight years ago for $3.2 million.</p>
        <p>Elsa Berry, who heads the board at Lycee Francais, said it was hard to part with the school's six illustrious old buildings, which sit in two clusters on the Upper East Side and serve 1,000 students.</p>
        <p>But, she said, the buoyant real estate market provided the school with an opportunity to create an endowment and to build a new and more efficient, if less historic, school building at a single location. The school is negotiating to buy a site on either the Upper East Side or the Upper West Side for a 115,000-square-foot school building, nearly double the current space. According to one broker, the school is close to a deal for a site in the East 80's.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to improve our operations from a technological standpoint and add new facilities for sports, student lounges and a cafeteria,'' said Ms. Berry, who attended the Lycee Francais as a girl and now runs the corporate finance department for BNP Paribas, a French investment bank. ''The board is working aggressively on a long-term strategic plan.''</p>
        <p>Many small institutions and private schools like the Lycee Francais in Manhattan are land rich but cash poor. The school's plan allows it to tap into its biggest asset. Richard Speciale, a managing partner at Aequitas, a real estate investment firm, is advising the school on its financial plan. He said that after selling the buildings, the school would make the annual payments on a tax-exempt bond for a new school from tuition payments and interest from the endowment fund.</p>
        <p>Lycee Francais was founded in 1935 by Count Charles de Ferry de Fontnouvelle, the French consul general at the time; Forsythe Wicks, a businessman who was president of the Alliance Francaise; and Paul Windels Sr., the city's corporation counsel. The school's alumni include Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Michel David-Weil, managing partner of Lazard Freres &amp; Company, and Danielle Steel, the novelist.</p>
        <p>Designed to be similar to a French lycee, the school emphasizes a classical education, including Latin and Greek. Instruction is primarily in French, although the school does provide an understanding of American language and culture. Ms. Berry said that 40 percent of the school's students are the children of French diplomats or business executives, and 40 percent are American, with 48 other nationalities accounting for the rest.</p>
        <p>Paul J. Massey Jr., a partner at Massey Knakal Realty Services, who is handling the sale of the Lycee Francais buildings, said that he expected at least half of them to be sold to house buyers. ''People are astounded that this many buildings would come on the market at once,'' he said. ''There's a pattern that's been building for 10 years of people reclaiming these buildings.''</p>
        <p>The most valuable building owned by the lycee is the Henry T. Sloane residence at 9 East 72nd Street, which is regarded by architects as one of the finest Beaux-Arts town houses in the city. The landmark five-story structure, which has an intricately carved limestone facade, Ionic columns and French windows, was built in 1896 by Sloane, son of the founder of the W.&amp; J. Sloane furniture store. But he lived there only briefly before a scandalous divorce in 1898.</p>
        <p>Joseph Pulitzer, the newspaper publisher, lived there before it was bought in 1901 by James Stillman, president of the National City Bank, then one of the most important commercial banks in the world. Mr. Stillman worked closely with William Rockefeller, a founder of Standard Oil, and Jacob H. Schiff and Edward H. Harriman in reorganizing American railroads.</p>
        <p>But starting in the late 1920's, most tycoons abandoned such luxurious town houses for more fashionable estates in the Long Island and Westchester countryside or for duplexes on Park and Fifth Avenues. Too costly to maintain, the buildings were demolished or converted into apartments, stores or museums. In the course of the conversions, many of the original details and fixtures were lost to history, although the lycee's buildings remain in relatively good shape.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter,'' Mr. Garfield said. ''Most people are gut-renovating everything anyway.''</p>
        <p>The lycee is also selling the Oliver Gould Jennings mansion, a Beaux-Arts house next door at 7 East 72nd Street, named after the man who built it in 1899 who was a director of Bethlehem Steel and the National Fuel Gas Company.</p>
        <p>The third property, at 60 East 93rd Street, was built in 1931 for Virginia Graham Fair Vanderbilt, a racehorse breeder and former wife of William Vanderbilt, the railroad tycoon. Her father was Senator James Fair of Nevada, who made a fortune from the Comstock Lode and the Big Bonanza mine. The limestone building resembles a French hotel during the reign of Louis XV and once housed the Romanian Mission to the United Nations. Each of the voussoirs, or wedge-shaped stones in the arches, has the face of a different woman carved into it.</p>
        <p>The fourth site is a neo-Classical-style limestone building with a mansard roof at 3 East 95th Street. It resembles a Parisian town house and was commissioned by Marion B. Carhart, after the death of her husband, Amory S. Carhart, a banking and railroad executive. She died shortly after its completion, in 1917. The school is also selling the adjoining three-story building at 5 East 95th Street and a limestone building at 12 East 73rd Street that was built in 1920 by Henry Allan Jacobs.</p>
        <p>''These are beautiful buildings,'' Ms. Berry said, ''but the huge hallways and grand staircases are not suited for a modern school.''</p>
        <p>In the end, one former student and some brokers lamented, the school may well lose some of the cachet of old New York as it moves to a modern home.</p>
        <p>''You get a sense of history going to school in mansions,'' Mr. Garfield said. ''But I'm sure the new building will be more efficient.''</p>
