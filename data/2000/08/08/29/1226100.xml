        <p>When she was a child growing up in South Carolina, Queen Esther recalls in her autobiographical cabaret show, ''Queen Esther: Unemployed Superstar,'' she dreamed of becoming a slinky Las Vegas entertainer like Lola Falana and being a guest star on ''The Mike Douglas Show.''</p>
        <p>Evoking that era, she dons a copper-colored wig and an evening gown to croon the bland 1970 ballad ''It's Impossible,'' while parodying the vacant poses struck by lounge singers back then.</p>
        <p>Since those days this singer and actress who appeared in the national tour of ''Rent'' has come far. ''Unemployed Superstar'' is the tale of her growing up, trying on and discarding pop-culture images from revolutionary black militant to tortured jazz singer and eventually deciding to be herself. Her story is strikingly similar to the one related by Kristen Childs in her recent Off Broadway show, ''The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin.''</p>
        <p>Through it all Queen Esther exudes an impish charm that recalls the sorely missed comedian and performance artist Danitra Vance. But by the end of the show her musical identity remains undefined. Her nondescript versions of ''The Lady Is a Tramp'' and ''Lush  Life'' fail to illuminate either the material or her ideas. And when she caps her show with two more vintage lounge songs, ''I've Gotta Be Me'' and ''The Good Life,'' it isn't clear whether she's making fun of them or embracing them.</p>
        <p>The best moments of ''Unemployed  Superstar,'' returning on Friday and Sept. 8 and 11 at Joe's Pub at 425 Lafayette Street in the East Village, are its nonmusical monologues in which Queen Esther impersonates embittered neighbors she met when she moved to Harlem. Characters like these could form the basis of an unsettling evening of serious political comedy.</p>
