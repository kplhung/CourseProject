        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that the state would help finance plans for a new performing arts and music center on the site of the original Woodstock festival in Bethel, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki was to appear today with the developer, Alan Gerry, at the festival site to unveil a proposal for the $40 million center, to which the state would contribute $15 million. It would be the first permanent structure built on the gently sloping hillside that once served as Max Yasgur's alfalfa field and, more famously, as the amphitheater for the August 1969 festival, a defining moment for many Americans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerry, 71, who built his television antenna business into one of the largest cable television operations in the country, bought the original concert site's 37 acres on the Yasgur farm in 1997, and has since spoken of creating a tourist attraction and shrine to the Sixties counterculture there.</p>
        <p>He said the arts center would stage a variety of theater, dance and music performances, from classical to rock, in a 4,000-seat indoor theater that could be partly opened to accommodate an additional 15,000 spectators sitting on the back lawn. He said that ground would be broken next spring and that the center would open in the summer of 2003.</p>
        <p>''We feel it's one of the few things that Sullivan County has to offer that has brand recognition and is known worldwide,'' said Mr. Gerry, a lifelong resident of the county who has created a multimillion-dollar foundation to promote economic and cultural development there. ''It's a natural franchise and no one can take it away from us.''</p>
        <p>The new arts center, which has not yet been named, is intended to attract thousands of tourists and help revive the Catskills, a struggling area whose fortunes have declined along with its grand resort hotels. In recent years, county officials and residents have tried to draw weekend visitors and other tourists by supporting proposals for at least two Indian-run casinos and building a $4 million corporate office park for high-tech and start-up companies.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Pataki said he hoped the Woodstock center would evolve into a cultural institution like the Saratoga Performing Arts Center or Tanglewood in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts. The $15 million in state money, which will come from discretionary funds controlled by Mr. Pataki and the Legislature, will be used for the construction of the theater and for road and land improvements. The state will not have any ownership of the new project, but invested the money to spur the sagging economy of the area, the governor said.</p>
        <p>''I think it will be a great facility for the Catskills,'' Mr. Pataki said.  ''They have always been one of the tourism centers for New York and they have lost that over the years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki said that as a 23-year-old law student, he had to stay home to tend his parents' farm while his friends went to the original Woodstock festival. Since then, he said, he has wanted to attend a concert there.</p>
        <p>''This kind of makes up for that,'' he said. ''I wasn't at Woodstock but I loved the music and it's going to be great to go up there. I love the Stones, but the fact is, the Band is my all-time favorite.''</p>
        <p>The Band, which gained fame as a backup band for Bob Dylan, was one of the many groups that played at the Woodstock festival. Levon Helm, the drummer and singer for the Band, who also lives nearby, will join Mr. Pataki at the site today for the announcement of the center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerry bought the 37 acres for roughly $1 million in 1997, and later acquired more than 1,300 surrounding acres for an undisclosed price. Mr. Gerry, who did not attend the original Woodstock festival, said the idea of preserving the site came from his daughter, Robyn, who makes a pilgrimage there every summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerry staged two festivals at the site in 1998 and 1999 by building a temporary metal stage and importing lights and sewage lines. More than 60,000 people went to the first concert, which included performers like Joni Mitchell and Pete Townshend, and 35,000 more attended the following year to see Britney Spears and other stars. They paid $19 to $65 for tickets, but Mr. Gerry said the concerts lost money because of the expense involved for setup.</p>
        <p>Many Sullivan county officials and residents praised the planned Woodstock center yesterday. Harvey Smith, the acting county manager, said it would bring a needed influx of customers for nearby hotels, restaurants, and stores, and also contribute to an active arts community that already stages classical music concerts, operas and plays for the county's 70,000 residents as well as summer visitors.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Smith said, the county is used to coping with large crowds because of its past as a resort area. ''As someone said to me, ''Happiness is a traffic jam,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I think there's enough infrastructure here for what's planned and I'm sure there will be enhancements. We are absolutely looking forward to this kind of economic activity. It's clean, and very positive.''</p>
        <p>But beyond the hoped-for economic benefits, the Woodstock center seeks to transform what was once a makeshift concert ground into a place where people can bring their families, relive their memories, or simply find out what the fuss was all about. Even today, many people still walk through the meadows to a monument that commemorates the 1969 Woodstock festival.</p>
        <p>''They come from all over the world,'' Mr. Gerry said. ''This site is on so many people's calendars that it's become a historic site.''</p>
