        <p>Yevgeny Kafelnikov walked onto Court 11 yesterday afternoon as if he were going to the office, wearing a neat white shirt with a navy-trimmed collar, his sandy blond hair cropped short.</p>
        <p>Facing sudden elimination in the first round of the United States Open, the 26-year-old Russian recovered by relying on his steady demeanor born of experience.</p>
        <p>Lleyton Hewitt, a 19-year-old Australian, walked onto the Grandstand Court wearing a deep red shirt, his auburn hair cupped in a nubby ponytail beneath a backward baseball cap. When he faced a two-set deficit yesterday, he began to pump his fist dramatically, his emotion surging with each cry of ''Come On!''</p>
        <p>The two men represent different points in the men's tennis timeline, if not heartline. Hewitt is an upstart; Kafelnikov is just looking for a jump-start.</p>
        <p>Kafelnikov, seeded No. 5 and a two-time Grand Slam winner, played in front of a standing-room-only crowd of 1,604 in the court wedged in the middle of the National Tennis Center and overcame a two-set deficit to defeat Orlin Stanoytchev of Bulgaria, 6-7 (5), 1-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3.</p>
        <p>Kafelnikov was surprised to find himself losing to a player ranked 116th in the world.</p>
        <p>''You know it's hard to even think when you're down, two sets to love, in a Grand Slam tournament,'' he said by phone from his hotel room after the match.</p>
        <p>''I guess I didn't expect to have a struggle early. I just thought if I could just hang in there a little longer, basically, my chances would improve.''</p>
        <p>Hewitt, seeded ninth, did the same, placed in the more marquee Grandstand Court, which seats 9,689. He lost the first set, 6-2, to fellow 19-year-old, Andreas Vinciguerra, of Sweden, then stormed back to win, 7-5, 6-3, 6-3.</p>
        <p>Vinciguerra was serving, 5-4 for the second set when Hewitt reminded himself that he did not want a repeat of Wimbledon, when he lost to Jan-Michael Gambill in the first round.</p>
        <p>''I didn't push the panic button,'' Hewitt said. ''I was put under the pump right from the beginning. To my credit, this was probably one of the best hard-fought wins I've won.''</p>
        <p>Whereas Hewitt has won four tournaments this season, tying him with Magnus Norman and Gustavo Keurten for the ATP Tour best, Kafelnikov has not won this year.</p>
        <p>''I don't know why; it's hard to explain it,'' he said. ''But I still think I can finish in the top 10 and that is my goal. I know I have a couple more good years left.''</p>
        <p>Kafelnikov said that as much as he wants to win this tournament, he is focusing on winning an Olympic Gold medal in singles and doubles in Sydney Australia, immediately after the United States Open. Hewitt will be there, too, playing for his home country.</p>
        <p>''It's a dream come true,'' he said, smiling to the small crowd in the interview room last night.</p>
        <p>Kafelnikov is trying to recapture that. He has won two Grand Slams (the 1996 Australian Open and 1996 French Open), and had his best United States Open finish in five years last fall, when he lost in the semifinals to the eventual champion, Andre Agassi.</p>
        <p>After committing 29 unforced errors in the first two sets yesterday, Kafelnikov calmed himself as Stanoytchev started to tire, then committed only four unforced errors in the next two sets, eight in the third. This was Stanoytchev's first United States Open and it showed in the end.</p>
        <p>Hewitt, who leap-frogged 91 places last year to finish the year ranked 22nd, is considered the heir to two-time United States Open winner, Patrick Rafter, who was not even seeded here.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, it's a pretty big step in such a short period,'' Hewitt said. ''I feel the more time, the more I'm getting more settled in these tournaments and the better I'll be for sure.''</p>
