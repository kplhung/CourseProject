        <p>A volunteer ambulance responding to a call from a woman with chest pains Sunday night collided with a motorcycle, killing a father and his 13-year-old son, the police said.</p>
        <p>Alberto Curtis, 37, and his son Alberto Jr. were riding a motorcycle south on Ocean Avenue in Midwood, Brooklyn, when they struck a station wagon with ambulance license plates driven by Shamai Goldstein. Mr. Goldstein, 36, a worker for the Hatzolah volunteer ambulance corps, was eastbound on Avenue L. He was trying to turn left onto Ocean Avenue when the crash occurred at about 9:30 p.m., the police said.</p>
        <p>The authorities said both motorcycle passengers were thrown from their vehicle, which struck the front left section of the ambulance. Alberto Jr. was pronounced dead at Maimonides Medical Center. His father was taken to Kings County Hospital Center, where he died at 1:30 a.m. yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldstein was treated for minor injuries at Methodist Hospital, and later released, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Although the crash remains under investigation, no charges have been filed. The police said the ambulance was using its sirens and lights at the time.</p>
        <p>The police were looking into whether the vehicle, as a station wagon, conformed with the standards required for ambulances.</p>
        <p>The crash took place just blocks away from the apartment at 2515 Glenwood Road where Alberto Jr. lived with his mother, Damaris, and his sister, Nakeisha, 9, said Nakeisha's godmother, Patrocinia Aguirre, 65.</p>
        <p>While Alberto Jr. and his sister often visited relatives in their parents' native Panama in the summertime, they were spending this summer in New York, playing in the neighborhood, going to the Y.M.C.A. or visiting Mrs. Aguirre's house to watch television, Mrs. Aguirre said.</p>
        <p>Alberto Jr. was due to start eighth grade at Public School 152 this year, his relatives said. He was killed hours after returning from a parade in Paterson, N.J., where he had played the drums as part of a Panamanian bugle and drum corps, said his aunt, Florence Crimes, 54.</p>
        <p>Mr. Curtis had been living at Mrs. Crimes's Ocean Avenue home since separating from his wife about five months ago. He was a subway car conductor, Mrs. Crimes said.</p>
        <p>After a dinner of potato salad and plantains, some family members set out on a motorcycle ride to Sheepshead Bay, Mrs. Crimes said.</p>
        <p>''I don't see why I would have been that nervous,'' she said. ''I know my brother could ride a motorcycle.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Curtis and his son rode on a friend's motorcycle. Family members said they were both wearing helmets.</p>
        <p>Two of Alberto Jr.'s cousins were on another motorcycle and witnessed the crash, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldstein was driving his ambulance to Ocean Avenue, where a 75-year-old woman had complained of chest pains. A second Hatzolah ambulance took the woman to Maimonides Medical Center.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Goldstein's neighbors, Shlomo Mantel, described him as a ''very nice family man'' who has been volunteering with Hatzolah for at least 10 years.</p>
