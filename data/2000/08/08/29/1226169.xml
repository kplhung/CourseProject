        <p>Seeking to pull the campaign debate back onto what he considers his turf, Gov. George W. Bush sharply attacked Vice President Al Gore on education policy today, asserting that the Clinton administration had complacently presided over ''a national tragedy'' in the public schools.</p>
        <p>But even as he tried to seize the offensive, Mr. Bush for the second straight week found himself responding to criticisms from the Gore campaign, this time, that he lacked a detailed plan for creating a prescription drug benefit for the elderly.</p>
        <p>In a sign that Mr. Gore's latest attack may have stung him a bit, Mr. Bush announced in a news conference today that he would spend part of next week unveiling a proposal to have the federal government subsidize prescription drug purchases by the low-income elderly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's press office also spent much of the day hammering at Mr. Gore's proposal to create a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. Suggesting that the Gore plan reeked of big-government liberalism, the Bush campaign asserted that it would effectively raise taxes for most of the elderly and nationalize prescription drug policies, ''similar to Hillary Clinton's attempt to nationalize health care in 1993.''</p>
        <p>''It's remarkably like Mrs. Clinton's plan,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign. ''It is a government-run, one-size-fits-all plan. And just like her plan, the Democrats thought it was popular and would put Republicans on the defense. But once people look at the details, they will rebel against it.''</p>
        <p>For all the discussion of health care, Mr. Bush intended today to kick off a week in which he will travel to New England, Ohio, Kentucky and Pennsylvania to promote his ideas for revamping the nation's public schools. He had also planned to spend last week discussing education, but was knocked off his message when he spent a good chunk of time defending his plan to cut income taxes across the board.</p>
        <p>The push and pull between the two campaigns to control the debate today made clear the issues they consider to be strongest for their candidates. Aides to Mr. Gore assert that voters trust Democrats more on health care, and they believe that the more Mr. Bush is forced to talk about it, the better the vice president will perform in the polls.</p>
        <p>''This is an issue that is on Gore's territory,'' said an adviser to the vice president. ''The Republicans just don't get it. And they don't have a plan. So they fall back on tired old rhetoric.''</p>
        <p>But the Bush campaign contends that Mr. Bush's focus on improving education, particularly for poor and minority students, underscores his commitment to ''compassionate conservatism.'' The governor's aides also believe that education provides a stark contrast between the two candidates' visions for government, and they have tried to use it to attack Mr. Gore's leadership abilities.</p>
        <p>''Vice President Gore offers more of the same,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He will not end the status quo because he is the status quo. He offers the failed ideas of the past. I offer new ideas, ideas that are working and that can appeal both to Republicans and Democrats to break the gridlock of education in Washington.''</p>
        <p>At his event outside the governor's mansion here today, Mr. Bush surrounded himself with teachers and school administrators from Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan -- all important swing states -- who have helped form a group called Educators for Bush that could provide a counterweight, albeit a mostly symbolic one, to the powerful teachers unions that support Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>In his remarks, Mr. Bush touted his plan for funneling federal money to the parents of students in failing public schools so the students could attend other schools, public or private. He would also encourage the growth of charter schools, require annual state reading tests for students in grades three through eight, and reward districts that issue report cards on their schools.</p>
        <p>But the governor devoted almost as much time to attacking Mr. Gore's education policies as promoting his own. He asserted that Mr. Gore's proposals would provide only ''the illusion'' of school accountability. And he sharply criticized the Clinton administration's record, saying seven and a half years of ''neglect'' had led to a widening of the performance gap between the haves and have-nots.</p>
        <p>''Nationwide, we are spending more on our public schools,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But the achievement gap between rich and poor, minority and nonminority, has remained the same or grown worse.''</p>
        <p>More than Mr. Bush's plan, Mr. Gore's plan focuses heavily on increasing federal education spending -- by $115 billion over 10 years -- for things like modernizing crumbling schools, reducing class sizes and increasing teacher pay.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore is proposing real reforms and resources to improve our public schools, while Bush is pushing a voucher plan that would drain money away from our public schools,'' said Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Bush's education event today, the governor was pressed on health care issues by reporters. Asked if he would sign legislation based on a bipartisan Senate plan, Mr. Bush offered a conditional yes.</p>
        <p>''I think we can make it better,'' he said. ''One idea is to make sure low-income seniors are better helped in paying for prescription drugs.''</p>
        <p>After the news conference, Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, said it was not necessary for Mr. Bush to explain the details of a prescription drug plan, because those details could be left to the legislative process.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes also blamed the Clinton administration for ''a litany of squandered opportunities'' in failing to win bipartisan support for a prescription drug plan. ''That's seven and a half years of failure,'' she said.</p>
