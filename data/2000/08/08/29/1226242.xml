        <p>No words were necessary for the Seattle Mariners to confirm to the baseball world tonight that Roger Clemens, even at his advanced age, is a dominant pitcher, one of the best. The swings they produced said everything about the quality of Clemens's overpowering stuff.</p>
        <p>There were weak swings and half swings and check swings, little ground balls and pop-ups. There were no good swings, no hard rips until Alex Rodriguez's single leading off the eighth. Rodriguez and Al Martin were the only Seattle batters to pull the ball with authority against Clemens, who pitched seven scoreless innings, allowing five hits and striking out seven, as the Yankees wiped out Seattle, 9-1, and increased their lead over Boston in the American League East to five games. The Mariners have lost 13 of 15, and their advantage over Oakland in the West has shrunk to a game and a half.</p>

        <p>No words were necessary for the Seattle Mariners to confirm to the baseball world tonight that Roger Clemens, even at his advanced age, is a dominant pitcher, one of the best. The swings they produced said everything about the quality of Clemens's overpowering stuff.</p>
        <p>There were weak swings and half swings and check swings, little ground balls and pop-ups. There were no good swings, no hard rips until Alex Rodriguez's single leading off the eighth. Rodriguez and Al Martin were the only Seattle batters to pull the ball with authority against Clemens, who pitched seven scoreless innings, allowing five hits and striking out seven, as the Yankees wiped out Seattle, 9-1, and increased their lead over Boston in the American League East to five games. The Mariners have lost 13 of 15, and their advantage over Oakland in the West has shrunk to a game and a half.</p>
        <p>Clemens's earned run average of 3.65 is the second best in the American League, behind Boston's Pedro Martinez, and his 11-6 record could be significantly better; the bullpen has blown five leads for him.</p>
        <p>While Clemens was on the disabled list in June, his right groin muscle healed, and as a result, he was able to make a necessary adjustment to his mechanics, through the guidance of the pitching coach Billy Connors. Clemens, a right-hander, had fallen into the habit of swinging his left leg in a long arc as he worked from the windup, perhaps to compensate for the problem in his groin.</p>
        <p>Connors suggested that Clemens draw his leg almost straight up, with little swinging in his foot; this way, he can keep his body and weight mostly centered over the pitching rubber before driving forward toward the plate. The principle is the same in many athletic functions, whether shooting free throws or throwing a baseball: eliminate the unnecessary movement.</p>
        <p>With his legs healthy, Clemens has been able to throw in this way and his fastball has been explosive and consistent. There may have been only two or three games in his time with the Yankees that Clemens has had a fastball as good or better than he did against the Mariners tonight.</p>
        <p>Clemens seemed to want the Seattle hitters to know exactly how hard he was throwing -- 94 to 95 miles an hour consistently, reaching 96 m.p.h. once -- because he fired his second pitch of the game over the head of the catcher and umpire and thumped it loudly against the backstop. Later in the inning, he pushed Edgar Martinez away from the plate with inside fastballs, prompting Seattle Manager Lou Piniella to push himself away from the Mariners bench and remark on the brushback pitches to his own players.</p>
        <p>Piniella's voice had already been heard in the Yankees' first at-bat. Derek Jeter dived back into first base after rounding the bag and was called safe on a tag play -- wrongly, as a replay showed, and then Piniella argued. Then, with two outs, the Yankees leading by 1-0 with a runner at first base, Paul Abbott zipped a fastball near the inside corner against Jose Canseco. Strike three to end the inning, Abbott thought; ball two, according to the rookie home plate umpire Scott Packard.</p>
        <p>Canseco smashed Abbott's next pitch about 430 feet, his 13th home run increasing the Yankees' lead to 3-0, and Piniella yelled and screamed at Packard from the dugout before the Mariners batted. Clemens did his fair share of staring and glaring at Packard during the evening, shaking his head and barking words as he came off the mound after disagreements in the fifth and seventh innings. It was as if Clemens and Piniella, with about 50 years of major league experience between them, were engaged in a tug-of-war over Packard's strike zone.</p>
        <p>Clemens may have walked away believing Packard stingy, but it is scary to imagine what Clemens might have accomplished with a wider strike zone. He struck out three in the first inning, getting ahead in the count with the fastball and finishing off the Seattle hitters with his split-fingered fastball. Fastball, splitter, just those two; he did not throw his slider until the 55th pitch.</p>
        <p>The Mariners collected five hits, but all the swings were defensive, their rallies somewhat pathetic. The right-handed-hitting Mike Cameron reached to poke a 95-m.p.h. fastball with two outs in the second and dumped a single over first base. Dan Wilson hit a soft liner through the middle, and Clemens walked Mark McLemore to load the bases, before Rickey Henderson lofted a fly to short center. Bernie Williams raced in and made a sliding catch.</p>
        <p>Clemens whiffed two more in the fourth and struck out McLemore on three pitches leading off the fifth. With two walks and another soft single, the Mariners loaded the bases again in the fifth. But both Martinez and John Olerud, accomplished hitters, popped up harmlessly. They were overmatched. Clemens's strikeout of Cameron in the sixth was his 150th of the season; at 38 years 24 days old, he became the oldest Yankee to strike out 150 in a season.</p>
        <p>He has 3,458 for his career, only 50 short of reaching Walter Johnson's 3,508 strikeouts, which are No. 7 on the career list. He has 258 victories.</p>
