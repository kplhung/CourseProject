        <p>An Eagle's Age</p>
        <p>Q.: If I had a pet bald eagle, which I could never have, of course, how long could I expect it to live?</p>
        <p>A.: Smaller eagles have occasionally been ''domesticated'' by falconers and were traditionally reserved for the hunting pleasure of medieval kings.</p>
        <p>The American bald eagle, which has a wingspan of up to seven and a half feet and would therefore require a very large falconer, has been reliably reported to live for 30 years and 5 months in captivity at the National Zoo in Washington, according to The Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds (Knopf, 1980); one banded bird lived 10 years and 5 months and might have lived much longer but was shot in the wild in Mexico.</p>
        <p>A bald eagle, formally Haliaeetus leucocephalus, does not even develop its distinctive white-feathered helmet until its fourth year, according to ''Manual of Ornithology,'' by Noble S. Proctor and Patrick J. Lynch (Yale, 1993). Before that, it goes through a series of immature plumages, which are wholly or partly replaced by a series of molts, or feather losses.</p>
        <p>While the bald eagle's head is not bald, but fully feathered, the legs are unfeathered, and the bare-legged look helps birdwatchers distinguish between immature bald eagles and immature golden eagles.</p>
