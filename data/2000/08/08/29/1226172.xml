        <p>Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, rich in history, gardens, grassy meadows and cultural centers, is shining now. Tens of millions of dollars have gone into rehabilitation of the parkland and its attractions.</p>
        <p>The National Tennis Center has been refurbished, sparkling for the United States Open, which began last night, and the Queens Museum and New York Hall of Science reflect the splendor of two World's Fairs.</p>
        <p>All this glory makes the sight of the huge, crescent-shaped pool around the Fountain of the Planets more jarring, said Robert Lawson, a spokesman for the Department of Parks and Recreation.</p>
        <p>Created for the 1963-64 World's Fair, and ''a relic to the grandiosity of the time,'' according to Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern, the fountain is 625 feet high when spraying at full height, only 50 feet shorter than Shea Stadium. It was one of the vast and vastly expensive projects that Robert Moses, the powerful Parks commissioner, created as a monument to himself and his achievements.</p>
        <p>Back then, the fountain was impressive -- some say breathtaking -- with a high-arcing geyser glistening in multicolored lights. Now it is a dirty, mucky swamp.</p>
        <p>The water is nearly stagnant. Algae flourish, coating the water in a solid-looking mass. Empty water bottles, soda cans and miscellaneous litter clog the surface. A few months ago, Bryan Pu-Folkes, a lawyer who lives nearby and who is pressuring city officials to clean it, found a dead swan and a dead turtle floating in the muck.</p>
        <p>However crowded the park itself gets -- and it has only slightly fewer visitors than Central Park -- the perimeter of the Fountain of the Planets is empty. People approach it the way they approach an open trash barrel. They quickly toss their empty bottles into it and just as quickly step back to a more seemly area.</p>
        <p>The water is such an obvious breeding site for mosquitoes that the City Health Department has singled it out for larvicide.</p>
        <p>Although Dan Andrews, a spokesman for Borough President Claire Shulman, says that workers skim the fountain five days a week and clean it twice a month, some 200 bottles were bobbing in it on Sunday. It smells bad. It is, in short, disgusting.</p>
        <p>There are two views on the main cause of the problem. City park employees, from Commissioner Stern to the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park maintenance workers, say parkgoers cause the littering. Some local residents say the Parks Department has let it go downhill.</p>
        <p>And many Queens officials, including Ms. Shulman, agree. ''It's a sore point,'' Ms. Shulman said. ''This is the top revenue-producing park in the city. It's the second-most-used park. But we don't have enough maintenance people at Flushing Park. It's a tradition that goes on year after year. We've badgered Henry Stern and whoever else we can get ahold of.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pu-Folkes, the neighborhood organizer, said: ''They've fixed up the rest of the park, where the tourists go. But they ignore the back end, that the immigrants use.''</p>
        <p>The north end, a good long walk from the museum, zoo, science hall and sports stadiums, is the site of soccer and cricket fields. That is where local residents -- longtime Queens residents and newer immigrants from Central and South America, the Caribbean, Africa, India and many other lands, play ball from morning till dark.</p>
        <p>On any fair day, crowds of mothers push strollers and herd toddlers, families walk the paths or loll on the grass, men kick balls, and others read newspapers in Hindi, Spanish, or other languages.</p>
        <p>But nobody goes near the Fountain of the Planets, except for a quick stop to pitch in a bottle.</p>
        <p>Thirty-six years ago, the fountain was a centerpiece of the World's Fair. ''It has a fascist character,''  Mr. Stern said. ''It was a time of very large things -- the bigger the better. We've spent more time cleaning this fountain. Maintaining it costs tens of thousands of dollars. It's very high-maintenance, with the algae and the bugs and the litter thrown into it. To try to breathe life into it, to fix the plumbing and make it flow again, would cost millions.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Shulman had another view. ''We don't have enough maintenance people at Flushing Park,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Though Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is one and a half times the size of Central Park, it has 47 maintenance workers, compared with 235 at Central Park.</p>
        <p>Of course, Manhattan has a resource that Queens lacks -- the Central Park Conservancy, a private organization that covers 85 percent of the cost of rehabilitating and maintaining Central Park, Mr. Lawson said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said that regular cleaning had not solved the algae problem, nor prevented the fountain from being used as a trash can, and he mused that perhaps it should be filled in or covered over.</p>
        <p>''If anybody has any plans or proposals for recycling the Fountain of the Planets,'' Mr. Stern said, ''I'll listen.''</p>
