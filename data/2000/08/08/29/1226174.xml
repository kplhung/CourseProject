        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>SURVEYS INDICATE A CLOSE RACE -- Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are in a dead heat in two new presidential polls, evidence that Mr. Gore is holding his postconvention poll bounce and could make it a close race. A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of likely voters showed Mr. Bush at 46 percent, Mr. Gore at 45 percent, the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, at 3 percent and the Reform Party candidate Patrick J. Buchanan at 1 percent.</p>
        <p>A poll by ICR of Media, Pa., showed Mr. Gore at 44 percent and Mr. Bush at 41 percent among registered voters. Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by as much as 18 points before the Democratic National Convention in mid-August, but Mr. Gore has closed the gap and has even led in some polls.</p>

        <p>Mr. Bush led among independents in the latest CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll by 44 percent to 36 percent, and the candidates were tied among independents in the ICR poll. The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 664 likely voters was taken Friday through Sunday. The ICR poll of 784 registered voters was taken Thursday through Sunday. Both polls had error margins of four percentage points.</p>

        <p>THE INDEPENDENTS --VENTURA STILL ISN'T RUNNING -- Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota has produced another book, this one saying that while he still has no interest in running for president, a lot of people have continued to urge him to do so. Should he take the plunge, Mr. Ventura said many people have told him, he would, as a former Navy SEAL, start off with an advantage because he would have the military vote locked up. The new book, ''Do I Stand Alone? Going to the Mat Against Political Pawns and Media Jackals'' (Pocket Books), was circulated to news organizations on Monday in advance of its September publication.</p>
        <p>In it Mr. Ventura, a former professional wrestler, whose 1998 election on the Reform Party ballot shocked the political establishment, says: ''I've had people come up to me on the streets and literally beg me to run. I'm honored as hell that they would want me to be their president. But I still don't want the job.''</p>
        <p>The book is Mr. Ventura's second. His first book, produced shortly after his election in 1998, was ''I Ain't Got Time to Bleed.'' In it, Mr. Ventura says the American electorate wallows in apathy, thereby perpetuating the two-party system. But he holds out no short-term hope that the third party that gave him his boost into office, the Reform Party, will be able to change things. It is too divided and ''dysfunctional,'' he said, which is one reason he left it.</p>

        <p>PROFESSOR SUES BUCHANAN -- An economics professor at Southern Methodist University has sued Patrick J. Buchanan, the Reform Party presidential hopeful, and his publisher for copyright infringement. A suit filed in federal court in Dallas last week by the professor, Ravendra Batra, asserts that Mr. Buchanan's 1998 book, ''The Great Betrayal,'' plagiarized parts of several books, including charts and graphs. ''Copyright is  about written expressions and there are some strong, strong similarities between Mr. Buchanan's work and Mr. Batra's works,'' Mr. Batra's lawyer, Arthur Navarro, said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan's campaign referred questions about the lawsuit to his publisher, Little Brown &amp; Company, but company officials said they had not seen the filing and had no comment. Mr. Buchanan's book argues against globalization of economies, and he criticizes the major political parties for seeking trade treaties that he believes hurt American workers and undermine the nation's sovereignty -- themes he is emphasizing in his presidential run. Professor Batra appeared on the CNN news program ''Crossfire'' in the early 1990's when Mr. Buchanan was a host. He said he first noticed the similarities between Mr. Buchanan's book and some of his own work in 1998.</p>
