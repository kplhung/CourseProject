        <p>The Intel Corporation said yesterday that it had recalled its fastest chip -- the 1.13 gigahertz Pentium III -- because the chip could cause system errors when running certain programs at a particular temperature and voltage. The problem is with certain circuits of the chip that have been shown to malfunction in laboratory tests running either a standard industry test called Sysmark2000 or a particular Linux compiler, said Michael Sullivan, an Intel spokesman. Intel said it has received no reports from customers, but Dell Computer and I.B.M. have stopped shipping PC's with the processor. Mr. Sullivan said very few of the processors had been shipped to date.</p>
