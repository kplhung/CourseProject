        <p>With New Jersey set to allow bear hunting for the first time in 30 years on Sept. 18 and Sept. 22, state wildlife experts have started holding classes to give hunters tips on finding and killing black bears and hauling carcasses out of the woods.</p>
        <p>The primers are intended to teach the state's bear hunters, novice and otherwise, about the behavior and anatomy of black bears on the eve of the most controversial hunt in New Jersey in years.</p>
        <p>''That will help a hunter be a more successful hunter, or at least have a chance to be a successful hunter,'' said Robert Eriksen, a wildlife biologist with the state's Division of Fish and Wildlife. ''We don't tell them how to hunt. But they do ask a lot of questions.''</p>
        <p>Four seminars were held last weekend, and 13 others are scheduled at division offices in six counties from Sept. 6 to 13. Hunters are not required to attend, but Mr. Eriksen and Patrick Carr, the division's chief wildlife biologist, suggested yesterday that hunters planning to pursue the bears need to familiarize themselves with their prey. New Jersey last allowed black bear hunting in 1970, and officials believe that most of the state's estimated 85,000 hunters have had little or no experience with bears.</p>
        <p>After the last hunt, the bear population was nearly extinct. Now, however, the population is robust, and in recent years there have been steadily increasing complaints about bears breaking into houses, intruding on campgrounds and picnic areas, and killing sheep and goats.</p>
        <p>In the weekend seminars, about 600 hunters were told about the animal's favorite foods in late summer: apples, berries, wild grapes, acorns, beechnuts, hickory nuts and walnuts. ''Hunters have to figure out where there's a good food supply,'' Mr. Eriksen said.</p>
        <p>They were also told about the best place to wound a bear mortally -- the heart and lung cavity. ''Shot placement is critical,'' Mr. Carr said. ''A well-placed shot kills quickly. We're emphasizing a quick, clean kill. We have respect for game that way, and less trailing,'' meaning, he said, that a bear shot in the heart or lung will most likely die on the spot and not run off into thickets before falling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carr said the best chance of hitting the lung or heart requires a shot when the bear, walking on all fours, is broadside to the hunter or starting to walk away at an angle with a front leg forward. Shots directly into the chest are not usually fatal because of a bear's dense shoulder muscles and bones, he said.  Head-on shots are discouraged because a bear's skull is too thick for an arrow or bullet to penetrate fatally. Hunters were also urged to hunt in groups because, officials said, a dead bear is too big for one person to haul from the woods. Adult male bears in New Jersey average nearly 400 pounds, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carr rejected a suggestion that the seminars were a response to charges from a vocal antihunt coalition that the hunt will unleash dangerous numbers of reckless hunters and wounded bears in the forests of growing exurban communities in bear terrain in the state's northwestern corner. ''We scheduled these seminars long before the animal rights people were involved,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lynda Smith, the head of the Bear Education and Resources Group, a coalition of 22 animal protection groups opposed to the hunt, said yesterday that the seminars distressed her. ''They're spending an awful lot of time, effort, and money teaching people how to kill bears when it could have been better invested teaching people how to live with bears,'' she said. ''They're not interested in public education because they need a hunt to sell licenses and raise money for their salaries.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carr disagreed. In recent weeks, he said, he and his staff members have routinely visited communities in northwestern New Jersey to instruct residents on ways to discourage bears from venturing near or into their homes. First and foremost, officials have said, residents must not feed bears and must store garbage securely. Thousands of state brochures with this ''bear-proofing'' tip and others have been distributed to town halls and campgrounds in recent months.</p>
        <p>Initially, New Jersey's Fish and Game Council, which administers the state's hunting rules, had proposed the killing of 350 bears, about a third of the total estimated bear population, in an area north of Interstate 78 and west of Interstate 287. But after an uproar by antihunt groups, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman urged the council to cut the number to 175. It did so on June 22.</p>
        <p>Opponents now want the governor to use her executive powers to cancel the hunt. But she had refused because, she has said, the bears threaten the safety of residents.</p>
