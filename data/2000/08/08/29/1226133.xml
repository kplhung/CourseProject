        <p>A federal judge approved a national settlement yesterday that covers tens of thousands of people who took fen-phen, the diet drug combination that was sold by American Home Products.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A federal judge approved a national settlement yesterday that covers tens of thousands of people who took fen-phen, the diet drug combination that was sold by American Home Products.</p>
        <p>The settlement, which American Home has said will cost up to $3.75 billion, offers benefits depending on a person's injuries, ranging from refunds for the cost of the drugs to cash payments of more than $1 million to those harmed the most.</p>
        <p>About 200,000 people have registered so far to join the settlement, which was approved yesterday by United States District Court Judge Louis C. Bechtle in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>But the settlement's approval does not resolve American Home's legal problems with fen-phen. At least 45,000 people have decided not to join the settlement and are instead pursuing separate lawsuits.</p>
        <p>In New Mexico, for example, hundreds of people have filed suits against American Home, contending that the company knew the diet drug combination could cause dangerous side effects but did not warn consumers. And in July, an Oregon jury awarded $29.2 million to two people who suffered heart valve damage. Weeks later that case was settled for an undisclosed amount.</p>
        <p>Last month, American Home said it would increase the $4.75 billion it has set aside to pay for the fen-phen litigation. The company gave few details but said that the new money would be ''significantly less'' than the $4.75 billion already put into its fen-phen reserve.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the company said that Judge Bechtle's decision ''resolves the vast majority'' of the fen-phen claims.</p>
        <p>''We have always felt this was a fair and equitable settlement,'' John R. Stafford, the company's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>But some lawyers representing fen-phen users said yesterday that they might appeal the settlement. Many lawyers had filed papers opposing the national settlement, saying that it was not fair and offered too little compensation for injuries.</p>
        <p>''Some people may get sick in the future and not be covered,'' said Edward Blizzard, a lawyer in Houston.</p>
        <p>But the lawyers chosen to represent the plaintiffs in the national class-action case said yesterday that the settlement covered any person who had taken the drug for more than 60 days. Even if those people are not ill, the lawyers said, they will get money to pay for a test to look for heart valve damage.</p>
        <p>''We feel we've protected everyone,'' said Arthur Levin, a lawyer in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Millions of prescriptions for fen-phen were written before Sept. 15, 1997, when American Home took the diet drugs off the market. A prescription for the fen-phen combination included American Home's Pondimin, its brand name for fenfluramine, and phentermine, another diet drug. American Home also sold Redux, a drug discovered by Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, which was marketed as the improved version of Pondimin.</p>
        <p>American Home said it had done more than a dozen clinical trials since 1997 that showed that serious heart valve disease among former diet drug users was rare and that the actual incidence of heart valve damage was ''far lower'' than was suggested when the drugs were taken off the market.</p>
        <p>Shares of American Home were unchanged yesterday at $54.56. In after-hours trading, they climbed as high as $56.06.</p>
