        <p>Speaker J. Dennis Hastert today offered significant concessions to Democrats on a plan to raise the federal minimum wage, moving to end months of stalemate on a popular bill that Republicans feared could damage them at the polls.</p>
        <p>The House and Senate earlier this year approved an increase in the minimum wage by $1 to $6.15 an hour, with the increase coming in 50-cent increments over two years in the House version and smaller annual amounts over three years in the Senate bill. The conflicting bills then stalled in the conference committee that was supposed to reconcile them, raising fears among some Republicans that they they were handing Democrats a potent campaign issue.</p>
        <p>In a letter to President Clinton today, Mr. Hastert sought to take that threat off the table. He agreed to the Democrats' demands to spread the $1 increase over two years, but insisted on $76 billion in tax cuts for small business over 10 years to help these companies pay ''the costs of this wage increase.''</p>
        <p>In another concession, Mr. Hastert proposed dropping pension provisions and a repeal of the estate tax that were attached to the minimum wage bill by House Republicans and that Democrats had criticized as a giveaway to wealthy Americans. Both of these provisions, however, have moved through the Congress on separate tracks and now must be dealt with on their own.</p>
        <p>''It is very clear that a vast majority of congressional Democrats and Republicans would like to see a balanced approach before we adjourn,'' Mr. Hastert said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert's proposal makes the minimum wage, in effect, the opening issue among Democrats and Republicans in Congress when they return next week from their late-summer recess.</p>
        <p>White House officials and Democratic leaders in Congress expressed cautious optimism that both parties would agree in the next month to raise the minimum wage for the first time since 1996. Officials signaled that a compromise could be reached on the Republican insistence on the small-business tax cuts.</p>
        <p>''If at long last the Republicans are serious about dropping many of their roadblocks to a $1 increase over two years, then that's good news,'' Gene Sperling, head of the White House's National Economic Council, said in an interview. ''There still remain some obstacles, but the president stands ready to work in good faith with Congress to get a bill he can sign.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert's letter reflects his desire to turn a political liability into a virtue in time for the fall elections.</p>
        <p>The initiative for the minimum wage offer came from Mr. Hastert and reflects how House Republicans feel more politically vulnerable on the issue than their Senate counterparts. Mr. Hastert said that Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, shared his views, but only the speaker signed the letter.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Senator Lott, John Czwartacki, said he had not seen Mr. Hastert's letter but added, ''Senator Lott supports moving the minimum wage increase as long as it's tied to small-business tax relief.''</p>
        <p>In another sign that Mr. Hastert is seeking to secure his legislative gains for the bruising fall elections, the speaker is also paring back on the tax-cut proposals that he will press for, cuts for married couples and retirement savings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert's offer comes just days after Governor George W. Bush found himself defending his proposed tax cut, and admitting that he needed to do a better job of promoting it.</p>
        <p>Scott McClellan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said the Texas governor supported a $1-an-hour increase in the minimum wage although he did not know if Mr. Bush supported the specific details in the compromises being discussed by Mr. Hastert and the Democrats.</p>
        <p>Congressional Democrats greeted Mr. Hastert's offer cautiously, and seemed tempted to milk even more political mileage out of his political predicament.</p>
        <p>''The proposal that the speaker made was in the right direction,'' said Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking House Democrat and a sponsor with Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts of the Democrats' original $1-over-two-years bill.</p>
        <p>The Republicans ''are high on the tax relief side and low on the benefit to minimum-wage workers,'' Mr. Bonior added, ''but it is my view that we can work this out and we can get a bill by sometime next month.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bonior noted that the current minimum wage, $5.15 an hour, has lost purchasing power in the more than two years since since he and Mr. Kennedy first asked Congress for the additional $1 increase.</p>
        <p>The $5.15 would have to rise by 24 cents to restore its 1998 purchasing power, according to an estimate furnished by Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. The minimum wage reached its greatest purchasing power in 1968 when it was worth the equivalent of $7.49 in 1999 dollars.</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Hastert beat them to the punch, going public with the Republican proposal, the Democrats had been discussing a revision of their original bill, one that would increase the minimum wage by more than $1. The aim was partly to restore the lost purchasing power and partly to answer the Republican insistence on raising the wage over three years instead of over two.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert's proposal of a $76 billion tax cut for small business drew criticism from Mr. Bonior, who said that it was almost four times greater than the $20 billion in tax relief that the Republicans had sought in 1996, the last time Congress approved a minimum wage increase.</p>
        <p>The Republican proposal would also remove from minimum wage coverage some workers now covered by the law.</p>
        <p>''After three years of foot-dragging, Republicans appear ready to sign on to a wage increase for the lowest paid workers,'' Senator Kennedy said. ''But their proposal is loaded with poison pills and oversized tax breaks for the wealthy.''</p>
        <p>Some House Republicans, however, criticized Mr. Hastert for compromising at all. ''I've never been in favor of bargaining on the minimum wage,'' said Representative John Shadegg, an Arizona Republican who voted against the wage increase in March. ''The package does not give businesses anywhere near the relief they're going to need.''</p>
        <p>In his weekly radio address on July 29, just before the Republican National Convention, Mr. Clinton appealed to Republicans to break the wage impasse.</p>
        <p>''If Republican leaders really want to make their compassion count, they ought to join me in getting back to business and raising the minimum wage,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>An increase in the minimum wage, to $6.15 an hour, would affect 10.1 million workers who now earn between $5.15 an hour and $6.14, and millions more who earn up to $6.70 an hour and would enjoy raises to maintain their margin over the new minimum wage, economists say.</p>
        <p>Two-thirds of the 10.1 million directly affected workers are over age 20, often a family's principal earners, while one-third are teenagers. When Congress voted in 1996 to raise the minimum in two annual steps, to $5.15 an hour on Sept. 1, 1997, from $4.25, there was much concern that millions of low wage workers would lose their jobs because they lacked enough skills to justify higher pay.</p>
        <p>But the 1996 increases came just as the economy began to boom, and the unemployment rate, instead of rising, fell steadily. Now, the concern over job loss is muted, the argument being that the strong economy is raising the pay of low-skilled workers anyway.</p>
        <p>''The modest proposal people are talking about -- $1 over two years -- is pretty close to what would happen anyway in the marketplace,'' said Kevin Murphy, a labor economist at the University of Chicago, who had argued in 1996 that the proposed increase in the minimum wage, to $5.15 an hour, would cost jobs.</p>
