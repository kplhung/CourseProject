        <p>After weeks of declining to release his tax returns, Representative Rick A. Lazio tried yesterday to end the swirling speculation about his finances.</p>
        <p>His aides provided limited access to 10 years of federal and state returns, and a review of the long-sought documents found not a whole lot, at least at first glance. No arcane tax shelters, tortuously reasoned exemptions, or offshore bank accounts on the Isle of Man. No evidence of a scheme to take a really high charitable deduction for donating an old pair of chinos to the Central Islip Salvation Army.</p>
        <p>It turns out that Mr. Lazio and his wife, Patricia, seem to have relatively ordinary finances. They declared a 1999 adjusted gross income of $150,400, largely from his Congressional salary of $126,740, with money also from her part-time work as a nurse, and investments in the stock market and real estate. They gave $2,422 to charity.</p>
        <p>While such an income might be the envy of most Americans, it would place Mr. Lazio among the poorest members of the Senate should he be elected.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides seemed pleased to put the clamor about the tax returns behind them, but the contents of the documents stirred only more conjecture: if there's nothing there, why did he wait so long?</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio pledged to release his tax returns soon after entering the Senate race in May, but had not done so, raising suspicions about whether he had the kind of financial problems that have tripped up other politicians in New York in recent decades.</p>
        <p>The campaign of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, criticized the delay, asking whether he was hiding something. The State Democratic Party even sent a young campaign worker dressed as Uncle Sam to Mr. Lazio's campaign events, to shout at him to disclose the returns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides said the wait stemmed from their need to review the returns. ''We said we would release them by the end of the summer, and we did,'' said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for the Lazio campaign. ''The only story here is Mrs. Clinton's desperation in basing so much of her campaign in attacking Rick on this issue. It shows the lack of seriousness on her part, and I think calls her credibility into question.''</p>
        <p>Though the Lazio campaign said it wanted to clear up the mystery, it did not exactly put the returns on the Internet. Yesterday, reporters (but not the public) were allowed to view (but not photocopy) the returns at Lazio campaign headquarters near Grand Central Terminal.</p>
        <p>The reporters got as much time as they wanted and were permitted to take notes, but the returns could not leave the room. Asked about such restrictions, Mr. McLagan said other politicians, like Gov. George E. Pataki, had used the same system. Many, including President and Mrs. Clinton, distribute copies.</p>
        <p>The Lazio campaign did not provide originals of the returns, and they did not include the dates they were filed. Aides said Mr. Lazio has always filed on time and had never sought extensions or filed amended returns. He used an accountant, except in 1990, when it appears he did his return himself.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lazio has proudly declared that she cleans her own house, and there was nothing in the returns to disprove that. The Lazios did not pay any taxes on salaries for household help or day care, and Mr. McLagan said they had never used hired help to care for their two young daughters. Other politicians in recent years have run into trouble for not paying taxes on wages to domestic workers.</p>
        <p>As had already been apparent from the disclosure forms that he files with Congress, the returns show that Mr. Lazio was smitten with the stock market in recent years, often engaging in short-term stock trades, though his lackluster results suggest he might have been better off putting his money in a mutual fund that tracked the market.</p>
        <p>One of his worst trades was in the stock of Halliburton, the oil services company whose chief executive then was Dick Cheney, now the Republican vice presidential nominee. Mr. Lazio lost about $5,000 trading Halliburton stock in 1998, when the stock was sagging along with oil prices.</p>
        <p>The returns confirm the details provided earlier by the campaign about one of Mr. Lazio's biggest successes in the market, his 1997 windfall from speculating in the stock of Quick &amp; Reilly, a brokerage firm. Those investments were the subject of an insider trading inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission that ended last week with the agency taking no action.</p>
        <p>In 1999, the Clintons reported income of $416,039.</p>
        <p>The Lazios' adjusted gross income has hovered around $150,000 in recent years, largely because of his Congressional salary. Their best year was 1997, when they declared $159,258 in adjusted gross income.</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's, before he went to Washington in 1993, Mr. Lazio was a county legislator and a lawyer, and his and his wife's adjusted gross income was as low as $88,928 in 1992, according to the returns.</p>
        <p>That year, the Lazios gave $1,397 to charity, or 1.6 percent of their adjusted gross income. On average, Americans donate 2 percent of their income to charity, and Mr. Lazio and his wife in recent years have usually given between 1 and 2 percent.</p>
        <p>The Lazio campaign did not release a list of charities that received the money. Mr. Lazio did not use his state tax return to contribute to the Breast Cancer Research Fund or three other charities that are listed.</p>
        <p>For a few years in the early 1990's, Mr. Lazio owned three investment properties on Long Island, but he sold two of them, leaving him with a house on Fire Island that he rents out in the summer and uses in the spring and fall. According to the returns, the Fire Island house has often given the Lazios large deductions that have helped them lower their taxable income.</p>
        <p>While the Clinton campaign has seemingly been deprived of an angle to attack now that the returns have been disclosed, it continued to try to stoke the issue.</p>
        <p>''Rick Lazio can't explain why it took three months to release his taxes,'' said Howard Wolfson, a Clinton campaign spokesman. ''Now he won't come clean with New Yorkers and reveal the real cost of his reckless trillion-dollar tax plan. It's time for Mr. Lazio to stop playing games and start talking straight.''</p>
