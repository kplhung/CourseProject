        <p>When the nude 14-foot bronze statue in front of the Arthur Ashe Commemorative Garden was unveiled last night, some in the crowd were confused over its meaning, while others remarked of its power.</p>
        <p>The imposing figure, sculptured by Eric Fischl, was designed to commemorate Arthur Ashe's legacy but not his likeness; this was the root of the confusion. It is a rough statue of a man serving, holding the grip of only a tennis racket, the end torn off to depict a baton to be passed from generation to generation. The stocky, intentionally out of proportion statue, which also depicted genitals in an abstract form, emerged from a base in a way intended to portray growth.</p>
        <p>Judy Levering, the president of the United States Tennis Association, prefaced the unveiling by saying that this statue, like Ashe, was provocative as well as elegant. She said, ''It is meant to represent all people from all races and backgrounds, Arthur's full range of impact.''</p>
        <p>And yet, some spectators at the unveiling were shocked.</p>
        <p>''This is disappointing to see,'' said Bee Atwell, 56, from Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''There's not even a tennis racket in his hand. It's not very relevant.''</p>
        <p>Emily Moore, the executive director of the Alliance Junior Tennis League in Roosevelt, N.Y., kept interrupting the ceremony by yelling out that the statue should be clothed or carrying books or children. ''Kids will see that, and what will they think?'' Moore said. ''Arthur Ashe stood for more than that.''</p>
