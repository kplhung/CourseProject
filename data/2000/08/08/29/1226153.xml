        <p>Two days after he was sworn in as Indonesia's economic czar, Rizal Ramli said today that the International Monetary Fund had become overly involved in the nuts and bolts of the country's economy in the course of its $43 billion bailout.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramli, an outspoken economist who has long been critical of the fund, said he wanted to renegotiate the I.M.F. agreement with Indonesia to limit the fund's role to broader issues like macroeconomics and monetary policy. ''By doing that, we reduce the destabilization that comes every time we review the program,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramli, who was named coordinating minister for economic affairs by Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid, as part of a recent shuffling of the country's cabinet, said he had spoken to officials at the fund, who said they were willing ''to exchange views and ideas.''</p>
        <p>''This is a new team,'' Mr. Ramli said in an interview. ''We would like to have a better sense of ownership of the program, so we can sell it to the public.''</p>
        <p>Given Indonesia's fragile recovery from the Asian economic crisis, and its continued dependence on money from the I.M.F., it is not clear how much leverage Mr. Ramli will have. But his comments underscore Indonesia's desire to present a more assertive and decisive face to foreign governments and markets, which have watched with alarm as the country has slid into near chaos in recent months.</p>
        <p>''I'm a no-nonsense guy, and I want results,'' Mr. Ramli said. ''When you're in a crisis, you don't have the luxury of holding long, analytical discussions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramli acknowledged that Indonesia's new cabinet got off to a wobbly start last week. Critics say it is stacked with loyalists of Mr. Wahid and devoid of allies of the popular vice president, Megawati Sukarnoputri. Those concerns, many said, rattled Indonesia's stock market and sent its currency, the rupiah, into a tailspin.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Megawati stoked the controversy by pointedly skipping the news conference at which Mr. Wahid announced the cabinet. Mr. Ramli described the president and vice president as being like a brother and sister, who might ''quarrel and grumble'' but would never ''damage each other.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, under pressure from Indonesia's Parliament, Mr. Wahid agreed to delegate some of his power to Mrs. Megawati. Mr. Ramli said the vice president would play a central role in developing policy, noting that he and the chief political minister would meet Mrs. Megawati for breakfast every Monday morning -- before meeting with Mr. Wahid the next day.</p>
        <p>Foreign investors were also unnerved that Mr. Wahid named as finance minister a former banker who had failed a government test to head a state bank. The banker, Prijadi Praptosuhardjo, was disqualified after failing a ''fit and proper'' test that assessed his character and past dealings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramli, who came to prominence for his attacks on corruption during the regime of former President Suharto, said Mr. Prijadi was a product of that era. Nevertheless, he said the new finance minister was a ''relatively decent man,'' with whom he could work.</p>
        <p>''Corruption in the Suharto era was of two types,'' he said, ''active corruption, in which you squeeze businesses for money, and passive corruption, which is like getting thank-you notes. I would venture to say he belongs in the second category.''</p>
        <p>As chief economics minister, Mr. Ramli will chart Indonesia's economic policy and be its public face to the financial markets and agencies like the I.M.F. His predecessor, Kwik Kian Gie, was criticized for his scholarly bent, which critics said translated into halting policies.</p>
        <p>With a doctorate in economics from Boston University, Mr. Ramli, 47, is also an academic. But his most recent job was running Bulog, the state logistics agency, which was a den of corruption in the Suharto era.</p>
        <p>''That he is willing to criticize the I.M.F. is nothing new,'' said Gustav F. Papanek, an economist who was Mr. Ramli's doctoral adviser at Boston University. ''He is someone who has the courage of his convictions.''</p>
        <p>Indonesia's Parliament voted today to investigate allegations that money was misappropriated at Bulog by a former aide to Mr. Wahid. The incident predated Mr. Ramli's tenure there. The Parliament also approved an investigation of possible misuse of funds involving a donation from the sultan of Brunei.</p>
        <p>Although it was only his first day on the job, Mr. Ramli issued a 10-point plan for rebuilding Indonesia's economy. He said the government planned to increase spending on public works projects in rural areas to reduce unemployment and increase wages. And he said Jakarta would spend more on military troops to police strife-torn parts of the country, like the Spice Islands.</p>
        <p>The perception that Indonesia is coming apart at the seams, he said, is the main reason investors have steered clear of the country. He said the violence contributed to the chronic weakness of the rupiah, which closed today at 8,245 rupiah to the United States dollar. Without such instability, Mr. Ramli said, the rupiah would trade at 7,500 to the dollar.</p>
        <p>Since March, the Jakarta stock market has slid more than 19 percent. Today, the benchmark index closed down 1.08 percent.</p>
        <p>''The perception in the markets is far away from the reality,'' Mr. Ramli said. Indonesia's economy, he said, could grow 4 percent this year.</p>
