        <p>Tiger Woods can't win every single time he tees it up. It only seemed that way.</p>
        <p>Woods, who had captured three straight major championships this year, lost to Spain's Sergio Garcia, 1-up, in the Battle at Bighorn tonight, a special made-for-television match-play event on ABC that finished under the lights at Bighorn Country Club. Garcia, who took the lead for the first time with a long birdie putt at 16, clinched the victory with another birdie at the 18th. In all, Garcia, who earned $1.1 million, made eight birdies. Woods, suffering from the flu, took home $400,000. Both players donated $200,000 to charity.</p>
        <p>''It was a great match, very exciting,'' Garcia said. ''We both played very well.''</p>
        <p>Woods added, ''Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make enough putts to keep the pressure on Sergio.''</p>
        <p>Woods seized an early advantage when Garcia bogeyed the first. Garcia then squared the match with a birdie at the third. They remained tied until Garcia three-putted the fifth. At the eighth, Garcia evened things again with a birdie. After they halved five straight holes, it looked as if Garcia would fall behind at the 14th, when Woods put his approach within a couple of feet. But, with darkness encroaching, Garcia made a 25-foot putt from the fringe to stay even. Then, after an aggressive chip on the par-5 15th, he converted a critical 8-foot putt to match birdies with Woods.</p>
        <p>Garcia, 20, was invited to this event courtesy of the effort he gave during last years P.G.A. Championship at Medinah Country Club.</p>
        <p>It wasn't merely his performance that captivated fans. It was his personality. Never was that more evident than when he dashed down the fairway after pulling off a miracle 6-iron from next to a tree on the 16th hole. The ball somehow reached the putting surface. Garcia's enthusiasm created an unforgettable image, the kind that makes a star. His play also generated hope of a new rivalry in a sport that could certainly use one.</p>
        <p>Since Medinah, however, there has been no rivalry. Woods and Garcia have gone in different directions. Woods has dominated. Garcia has declined.</p>
        <p>Woods, 24, has won eight tournaments in 16 starts this year, including the United States Open, the British Open, and the P.G.A. Championship. No player had captured three majors in one season since Ben Hogan in 1953. In his most recent triumph, at the NEC Invitational in Akron, Ohio, which ended in almost total darkness Sunday night, Woods increased his 2000 earnings to $7.69 million.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Garcia, though ranked 15th in the world, has no victories this year on the PGA Tour and stands only 66th on the money list. Most significantly, he hasn't been a big factor in the big tournaments. Still, Garcia hasn't lost his most attractive possession, his youthful charm.</p>
        <p>The match seemed certain to generate good ratings, perhaps even exceeding the 6.9 that ABC got last year when Woods beat David Duval, 2 and 1, in the Showdown at Sherwood, held at Sherwood Country Club north of Los Angeles.</p>
