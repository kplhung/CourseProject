        <p>IT is possible that friendship with a country is not so different from a friendship with a person. You close your eyes to flaws, sometimes significant ones, preferring not to see them, even as others point them out.</p>
        <p>This is how it was with Lois Wheeler Snow.</p>
        <p>Her husband, Edgar Snow, was an American journalist who came to know Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai when they were struggling Communist revolutionaries in the 30's, and he remained on cordial terms with them even when China was closed to most Americans.</p>
        <p>Edgar Snow is one of the few Americans to have been buried with honors in Communist China. After her husband's death, Mrs. Snow, a onetime Broadway actress who gave up her career to follow her husband abroad, made several trips to China and was treated as an honored guest.</p>
        <p>Those days, of what she calls ''the nice well-behaved Mrs. Snow,'' are now over.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Snow, who turned 80 last month, has been protesting human rights violations in China since the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989. This April, she traveled to Beijing from her home in Switzerland to try to meet with Ding Zilin, whose son was killed during the Tiananmen crackdown, and was prevented from doing so by the Chinese government.</p>
        <p>This week, as Li Peng, the chairman of China's National People's Congress, who was prime minister in 1989, comes to New York as a delegate to the Conference of Presiding Officers of National Parliaments at the United Nations, Mrs. Snow is also here. Working with the group Human Rights in China, she is demanding an investigation of the Tiananmen killings and the release of political prisoners.</p>
        <p>She has also said that she may have to consider removing her husband's ashes from China.</p>
        <p>Is such a thing possible?</p>
        <p>''It would be very difficult physically,'' Mrs. Snow says, at Human Rights' Manhattan office. ''I know that they are buried in a cement or stone container deep in the earth. But what is important is that I maintain that threat, and if it gets to a point it is necessary to get the ashes out, at least it will be a worldwide scream. It would be a tremendous blow to the Chinese.''</p>
        <p>How did a Broadway actress become an activist?</p>
        <p>''I married Edgar Snow. That's what happened.''</p>
        <p>Their story begins in 1945 in New York. Mrs. Snow, then Miss Wheeler, 25, who had grown up in a conservative Republican home in Stockton, Calif., was a leading lady on Broadway. Edgar Snow, 15 years her senior, was a journalistic star, the author of the 1937 classic ''Red Star Over China.'' The two met at a party for Russian War Relief and married four years later.</p>
        <p>The McCarthy era was difficult for both. Though Lois Snow says she never joined any political party, she was blacklisted. She was, however, able to continue working in a television soap opera, ''The Guiding Light.'' (''Nurse Janet Jackson,'' Mrs. Snow remembers. ''She was after all the doctors in the hospital.'')</p>
        <p>Her husband fared less well.</p>
        <p>''China was a dirty word and a very dangerous one, and nobody was willing to publish Edgar Snow,'' Mrs. Snow said.</p>
        <p>In 1959 the Snows, now with a son and daughter, moved to Switzerland, where Mr. Snow was able to work and Mrs. Snow could not. In 1970, when Mr. Snow was reporting on China, the Snows were invited to stand with Mao Zedong on the reviewing stand during a National Day observance.</p>
        <p>It was the time of the Cultural Revolution, with those critical of Mao sent to prisons and work camps, but that was not apparent to the Snows. Her husband tried to learn what was happening, Mrs. Snow says, but ''the facts were not there, plus he was ill.''</p>
        <p>A year and a half later, as her husband was dying, Prime Minister Zhou Enlai sent three doctors and a nurse to Eysins, the Snows' small village in Switzerland. They stayed for three weeks, until his death.</p>
        <p>''Anything Ed needed was immediately supplied. It was one of the most wonderful things in my life.''</p>
        <p>IN the next 15 years, Mrs. Snow traveled yearly to China, for many years blind to the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. ''I was surprised the central bookstore in Peking had nothing but propaganda,'' she says, using the older word for Beijing. ''I knew that was crazy, but I accepted it as part of -- I don't know. The schools were closed, the students were out working, they didn't have time for books.''</p>
        <p>Asked how she made a living after her husband's death, Mrs. Snow at first sidesteps the question. Later, she returns to the subject herself. She did a lecture tour in the United States and Europe, she says, telling people how ''wonderful'' the Cultural Revolution was. In the 80's, as books on the abuses of the Cultural Revolution appeared, she resisted them. Tiananmen changed her.</p>
        <p>Does she now feel foolish about that lecture tour?</p>
        <p>A sad, small little smile, which would be recognized by anyone who has been disappointed in a friend.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to describe how I feel. I feel I was used. I know I was naive. They encouraged my lecture series. When a few years later it turned out that what I was talking about was nonsense, it is true I felt used. They needed Ed; without him, they needed me. And I fell for it.''</p>
        <p>''It's hard even for me to realize that I went for such a long time without being aware of the transgressions of human rights, that it took Tiananmen to wake me up. There it was on television; in the living room, in front of your face. The kids, my children, were with me. We were screaming. It was like being there.''</p>
