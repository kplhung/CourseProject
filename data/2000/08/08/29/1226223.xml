        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Less Training, More Teachers: New Math for Staffing Classes'' (front page, Aug. 24):</p>
        <p>Those who advocate recruiting teachers through reduced educational requirements are offering only a partial solution to the teacher shortage. Unfortunately, our educational reformers and politicians have failed to address the problem of retaining teachers.</p>
        <p>As a veteran educator, I have seen a growing number of teachers leave the profession for another career. In Georgia, approximately one-third of public school teachers leave the profession before their fifth year. It is a negative trend that creates schools filled with new and inexperienced teachers. The constant turmoil over teacher issues threatens to undermine efforts to improve our schools.</p>
