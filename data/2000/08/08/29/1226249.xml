        <p>Jennifer Capriati tried to serve yesterday as the wind whipped around the darkened Louis Armstrong Stadium during the drizzly first day at the United States Open. Planes roared, thunder boomed and the public address system crackled like gunfire, its startling blasts causing a delay minutes before the rain began pouring down.</p>
        <p>But the 24-year-old Capriati was calm, easing jitters about playing the first match on the first day, and held a 6-4, 1-0 lead over Emmanuelle Gagliardi. Play resumed after about 90 minutes, and Capriati took little time to dispatch the 82nd-ranked Gagliardi, 6-4, 6-0. Afterward, the 15th-seeded Capriati was all sunny smiles and waves to the crowd.</p>

        <p>Jennifer Capriati tried to serve yesterday as the wind whipped around the darkened Louis Armstrong Stadium during the drizzly first day at the United States Open. Planes roared, thunder boomed and the public address system crackled like gunfire, its startling blasts causing a delay minutes before the rain began pouring down.</p>
        <p>But the 24-year-old Capriati was calm, easing jitters about playing the first match on the first day, and held a 6-4, 1-0 lead over Emmanuelle Gagliardi. Play resumed after about 90 minutes, and Capriati took little time to dispatch the 82nd-ranked Gagliardi, 6-4, 6-0. Afterward, the 15th-seeded Capriati was all sunny smiles and waves to the crowd.</p>
        <p>''I feel totally different coming into this,'' she said. ''I have no issues I want to discuss or anything.''</p>
        <p>Capriati's self-aware smiles were a contrast to the tears that marked her final appearance at last year's Open. After falling to Monica Seles, 6-4, 6-3, in the fourth round, a composed Capriati recited a statement discussing her personal problems as a teenager. But she crumbled under questioning and left the room in tears.</p>
        <p>This year things are different. Seeded for the first time since 1993, and more confident, she likes the change. ''I've established my presence for good, you know, hopefully,'' she said. ''I like it better like this.''</p>
