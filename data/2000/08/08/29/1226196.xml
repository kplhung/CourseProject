        <p>Vice President Al Gore today escalated his attacks against the pharmaceutical industry, criticizing the makers of two prescription drugs by name, calling for greater competition and promoting his plan for a Medicare drug benefit.</p>
        <p>The drug industry has long been one of Mr. Gore's corporate bogeymen, along with oil, tobacco and insurance. But in today's speech to a forum of elderly people at Florida State University, Mr. Gore expanded his criticism, saying he would veto any legislation extending monopoly patents for prescription drugs. ''You elect me president and I'll veto every one of those bills,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore singled out two drugs: Claritin, an antihistamine made by the Schering-Plough Corporation,  and the arthritis drug Lodine, made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a subsidiary of the American Home Products Corporation. In the case of Claritin, Mr. Gore said its maker spent more money on advertising than on research. As for Lodine, which is prescribed for people and pets, he said that American Home Products charged pharmacies more than veterinarians.</p>
        <p>''I'm all for them making profits and having more research and whatnot,'' Mr. Gore said. ''But I'm not going to stand by if they behave in an unfair way.''</p>
        <p>Today's trip was Mr. Gore's second to Florida in less than a week, underscoring the importance his campaign places on the state. The governor here is Jeb Bush, the brother of Mr. Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's address began a four-day trip devoted to health care. He expects to emphasize plans for a patients' bill of rights, expanded coverage for children, the solvency of Medicare and investments in medical research at stops in New Mexico, Oregon and Washington.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of Mr. Gore's health care program is his proposal for a voluntary Medicare benefit that would provide prescription drug coverage for the elderly. About 13 million Medicare beneficiaries have no drug coverage, while many others pay expensive premiums through Medigap plans, Gore aides said.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Gore's plan, older Americans with no coverage who have incomes of 135 percent of the poverty level or less -- about $12,000 for an individual and $14,000 for a couple -- would have their drugs covered without charge.</p>
        <p>Those with higher incomes would pay a premium on a sliding scale and would be reimbursed half the cost of their prescriptions up to $5,000 a year. After Medicare recipients paid $4,000 out of pocket for prescriptions, the government would pay all remaining costs. The Gore campaign estimates the proposal's cost at $253 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>The plan is complicated, and Mr. Gore misstated some details today. But his larger points were clear: He has a detailed plan, while Mr. Bush does not; his plan would be affordable within a balanced budget, while Mr. Bush, he says, cannot afford a comprehensive plan because of the size of his proposed income tax cut, which would consume $1.3 trillion of the federal surplus over 10 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has yet to propose a specific prescription drug plan, but his aides say he would build on the proposal of a bipartisan Congressional commission that would seek to spur competition between public and private plans for Medicare recipients, giving consumers a choice of plans, some of which would provide a drug benefit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has also said he supports granting low-income elderly people a subsidy that they could use to buy prescription-drug insurance, but would leave the details to be determined in negotiations with Congress.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters on Air Force 2 today, Mr. Gore said, ''The time for generalities without specifics I think is just about over. Where specifics are concerned, it's kind of put up or shut up time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's focus on prescription drugs coincided with the imminent release of a television advertisement on the topic by the Democratic National Committee. Both the Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee began broadcasting advertisements on prescription drugs today.</p>
        <p>The Democratic commercial, which will appear in nine states, accuses Mr. Bush of ''siding with the big drug companies.'' And those companies were Mr. Gore's main target today. He described an industry that kept prices artificially high while its patents remained in effect.</p>
        <p>Speaking of Schering-Plough, Mr. Gore said: ''According to The Wall Street Journal they spend more money every year advertising Claritin and promoting Claritin than Coca-Cola spends to advertise and promote Coca-Cola. So if they're using these profits more for that than for research and if a lot of the most valuable research is being paid for by the taxpayers anyway, then I believe that we need more competition.''</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman,  denounced Mr. Gore's proposals as a ''nationalized drug plan.''</p>
        <p>William O'Donnell, a spokesman for Schering-Plough, said, ''The pharmaceutical industry is responsible for breakthrough discoveries that make invaluable contributions to the nation's health care system. The real issue in the United States is the fact that a significant portion of our population lacks prescription drug coverage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, speaking of the drug Lodine, and its prices, said, ''While it costs $108 a month for a person, it costs $37.80 for a dog.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for American Home Products declined to comment.</p>
