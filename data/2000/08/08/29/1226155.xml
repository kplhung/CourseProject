        <p>The Applied Micro Circuits Corporation, a San Diego-based maker of chips for networking equipment, said today that it had agreed to acquire MMC Networks Inc. in a stock swap valued at about $4.5 billion.</p>
        <p>MMC Networks, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., designs chips to speed the connections between fiber optic communications lines and electrical circuits. The company contracts out the actual fabrication of the chips, a practice that has led such companies to be labeled ''fabless.''</p>
        <p>Both Applied Micro and MMC are large suppliers to network equipment manufacturers like Nortel, Cisco and Lucent, and the acquisition is part of Applied Micro's strategy to broaden its product line.</p>
        <p>Applied Micro shares closed today at $183.81, down $4.75, in Nasdaq trading, while MMC shares jumped $31.75, to close at $110.</p>
        <p>Analysts praised the acquisition as a logical strategic move, but noted that the price was high for a small, little-known company.</p>
        <p>Karl Motey, an analyst with CE Unterberg Towbin, said that Applied Micro and its primary competitors, PMC-Sierra Inc. and the Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation, had all been bulking up through acquisitions so that they could offer the network equipment companies a complete catalog of chips. Companies like Nortel and Cisco ''are no longer just looking for component suppliers, but partners at the architectural level,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''So the chip suppliers,'' he said, ''are all trying to build a war chest of components.''</p>
        <p>Although voice and data communications are increasingly transmitted as optical signals carried over fiber optic cable, those pulses of light must be translated back into electrical current for the switches and routers that direct them across the Internet to their ultimate destination. In acquiring MMC Networks, Applied Micro gains a leading provider of network processors, traffic management and switch fabric technologies, which are at the core of a wide range of switches and routers, including optical networking, Web switching, subscriber management, broadband access and other communications systems.</p>
        <p>''There is a new market emerging for intelligent optical networking systems,'' said Dave Rickey, Applied Micro's president and chief executive, in a statement. ''With this merger, we can provide the most complete and powerful integrated circuit solutions for this rapidly growing market.''</p>
        <p>Doug Spreng, as president of MMC, which will become a subsidiary of Applied Micro, will report directly to Mr. Rickey and join the Applied board upon completion of the merger.</p>
        <p>Drew Peck, an analyst with SG Cowen, said this merger, as well as some earlier deals, transformed Applied Micro from a niche player to a powerhouse. ''With this deal, they've basically become the dominant network component supplier,'' he said. ''They have the highest performance across the broadest array of products.''</p>
        <p>But the deal is not without risk, Mr. Peck added. ''The bet they're making is that huge customers like Cisco, Nortel and Lucent will happily stop making these components internally, and use more generic components,'' he said. ''If you believe in this strategy, then the question is how much was it worth. There have been myriad acquisitions of unheard-of companies at unheard-of valuations, but it will be two or three years until we know if it was worth it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Motey of CE Unterberg said he believed the deal would start paying for itself soon. ''We're estimating an additional $140 to $150 million in revenues in 2001, on top of the $500 million we were estimating for A.M.C.C.,'' he said. ''With MMC, A.M.C.C. gets a company with a proven track record, with 72 design wins and 42 customers.''</p>
        <p>The deal is the largest in a recent string of networking component acquisitions, including that of Quantum Effect Devices Inc., which was bought last week by PMC-Sierra in a transaction originally valued at $2.3 billion; that of the closely held SiTera Inc., acquired in May by Vitesse for $750 million; and that of the closely held Agere Inc., which Lucent bought in April for about $504.5 million. Lucent has said it plans to spin off its unit that makes chips and optical parts.</p>
