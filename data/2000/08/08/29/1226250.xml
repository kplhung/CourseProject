        <p>Justin Gimelstob bounded forward furiously, shocked and screaming, the sound of his voice slicing through the suddenly quiet stadium.</p>
        <p>''No way!'' he yelled, his face reddening. ''No way!''</p>
        <p>In the fourth set against Christopher Rochus, Gimelstob, a native of Livingston, N.J., had just been called for a fault on a hard serve that appeared to sneak inside the line. The line judge retracted her call, but the chair refused to accept the revision.</p>
        <p>This produced more protestations from Gimelstob, who refused to continue playing until a referee from the United States Tennis Association ruled on the play. Boos showered down from a crowd that had been roaring its praises of the 89th-ranked Gimelstob moments before.</p>
        <p>''I didn't feel bad because I was right,'' Gimelstob said of the hometown crowd rooting against him for several points. Then he grinned. ''But it is remarkable how I have the ability to turn a 100 percent Gimelstob crowd against me in one point. It's just an innate ability I have. I have the ability to keep people in a stadium. To keep people in there rooting for me is another question.''</p>
        <p>He would go on to lose the next  game but win the match in a tie breaker, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4), powering aces that skirted the center line while botching easy volleys. It was an impassioned and unpredictable performance with 34 aces and 49 unforced errors.</p>
        <p>After the match, John McEnroe approached Gimelstob, perhaps recognizing a kindred spirit.</p>
        <p>''McEnroe came into the locker room and said, 'I thought you were going to say, ''You can't be serious.'' ' '' Gimelstob said. ''But I think it's been established that there's only one guy who can freak out like that and then win the next game, and it's not me.''</p>
