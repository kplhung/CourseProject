        <p>Citing ''rare but serious risks'' from Lotronex, a drug prescribed for women with irritable bowel syndrome, the Food and Drug Administration has ordered that a warning pamphlet be attached to each bottle of pills to alert consumers to early signs of dangerous side effects.</p>
        <p>The order on Thursday, the first time that such a pamphlet has been required for any drug, came about because serious side effects have been reported in 15 patients since Lotronex was approved in February. It is used to treat women with chronic diarrhea resulting from the bowel syndrome.</p>
        <p>No one died from the side effects, but 10 of 15 patients with side effects were hospitalized for bowel problems thought to be caused by the drug. Three needed surgery, including a 56-year-old woman whose entire colon had to be removed.</p>
        <p>Although the drug agency released a statement saying that the benefits of the drug outweighed the risks, a consumer group said Lotronex should be taken off the market because irritable bowel syndrome was not life-threatening, whereas the drug's potential side effects could be. Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, said the group would ask the F.D.A. to have Lotronex withdrawn.</p>
        <p>Two side effects led to the hospitalizations: complications from severe constipation and a condition called ischemic colitis, in which blood flow to parts of the gut was cut off.</p>
        <p>The pamphlets are the first to be issued under a regulation that went into effect last year, allowing the drug agency to order the creation of ''medication guides'' for certain drugs with potentially significant risks.</p>
        <p>Dr. Victor Raczkowski, a deputy director in the agency office that evaluates gastrointestinal drugs, said, ''The medication guide is a new tool that we have at F.D.A. to communicate in lay language and educate consumers about the potential risks associated with drugs and steps they might use to avoid possible serious injury.''</p>
        <p>The guides come at a time when the agency has faced harsh criticism from groups like Public Citizen for having approved drugs that later had to be withdrawn because of adverse effects. Nine drugs have been taken off the market since 1997, including two this year -- Rezulin for diabetes and Propulsid for gastroesophageal reflux.</p>
        <p>The pamphlet warns patients not to start taking Lotronex if they suffer from constipation, to call their doctors if constipation occurs when they take the drug, and to stop taking it and call the doctor if they develop new or worsening abdominal pain or blood in their bowel movements. Patients are also advised to stop taking the drug if, after four weeks, it has not helped them. ''At that point, you'd not be deriving benefit but you would be exposed to some of the risks,'' Dr. Raczkowski said.</p>
        <p>The agency is also ordering labeling changes and sending new information to doctors, warning them not to prescribe Lotronex for patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative or ischemic colitis.</p>
        <p>The drug's manufacturer, Glaxo Wellcome Inc., is cooperating with the F.D.A.</p>
        <p>Once a drug is approved doctors are free to prescribe it for anyone. At least one of the 15 patients with severe side effects was male, even though the drug is not supposed to be prescribed for men because studies show it does not help them, Dr. Raczkowski said.</p>
        <p>About 15 percent of the population has irritable bowel syndrome. The condition is more common in women, and its cause is not known. Patients suffer from chronic or recurring abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, or both. Severe diarrhea can occur with little or no warning, and can keep patients homebound.</p>
        <p>At an F.D.A. meeting in June about the drug, several women who had taken it testified that it was the first medication that had ever enabled them to lead more normal lives.</p>
        <p>Lotronex was approved to treat only the diarrheal form of the syndrome. It acts on nerves in the gastrointestinal tract to relieve pain and diarrhea.</p>
        <p>But Lotronex does not help all women it was intended for. In trials, the drug had a clear benefit in only 2 out of 10 patients; 4 of 10 had no benefit at all; and the remaining 4 had improvements that might have been due to the drug.</p>
        <p>Although that might sound like a modest benefit, Dr. Raczkowski said he thought that degree of success was ''not very much out of line'' with the results for other drugs. He added that Lotronex was the first drug to be shown effective specifically for the bowel syndrome.</p>
        <p>More than 200,000 prescriptions have been written for the drug.</p>
