        <p>Morris S. Dees Jr., who has won a series of civil rights suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist groups in a campaign to put them out of business, came to court here today to try to seize the Aryan Nations compound that has nurtured white supremacists for more than 20 years.</p>
        <p>In his suit here, Mr. Dees, a founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a woman and her son, both white, who were attacked by guards near the compound in July 1998. The idea is that a large judgment will force the Aryan Nations to turn over the compound to the plaintiffs in payment.</p>

        <p>Morris S. Dees Jr., who has won a series of civil rights suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist groups in a campaign to put them out of business, came to court here today to try to seize the Aryan Nations compound that has nurtured white supremacists for more than 20 years.</p>
        <p>In his suit here, Mr. Dees, a founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a woman and her son, both white, who were attacked by guards near the compound in July 1998. The idea is that a large judgment will force the Aryan Nations to turn over the compound to the plaintiffs in payment.</p>
        <p>The suit contends that not only the guards but also the Aryan Nations, its 82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and his second in command, Michael Teague, should be held liable, on the ground that they run their security force in a negligent manner and encourage violence.</p>
        <p>At the time of the assault, the guards said later, they thought they were under armed attack by militant Jews. And in response to the suit's accusation that his client encourages violence, the lawyer for Mr. Butler maintains in court documents that ''demonizing Jews is still legal under the First Amendment.''</p>
        <p>''It is still legal in this country to be a bigot,'' the defense says. ''It is still legal to hate. Pastor Butler quite properly erects the twin defenses of both free speech and religion contained within the First Amendment.''</p>
        <p>Two security guards, who pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the assault and are now in prison, are expected to be called as witnesses for the plaintiffs. A third guard is a fugitive in the criminal case.</p>
        <p>Jury selection began this morning in the Kootenai County Courthouse as members of a special police weapons unit patrolled the roof and the grounds and a sole Aryan Nations supporter marched on the sidewalk nearby, waving the group's black and red flag.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son Jason, now 21, told the police that they were driving home from her niece's wedding through the nearby community of Hayden Lake at dusk on July 1, 1998, playing music and having a good time.</p>
        <p>Ms. Keenan said that her son had been in the Job Corps and that he threw his Job Corps card out the window on a whim and, inadvertently, his wallet along with it. The wallet had been a gift from his grandfather, she said, so she turned her car around and drove back to look for it. Her son got out with a flashlight and quickly found the wallet, she said, and that is when she realized that they were near the entrance to the Aryan Nations' Hayden Lake compound.</p>
        <p>Ms. Keenan testified at a hearing that when she turned around, her 1977 Datsun had backfired, as it often did. Inside the compound, Shane Wright, an Aryan Nations security guard, thought he heard a gunshot. Seeing a car parked on the road, he and Jesse Warfield, then head of security, jumped into a pickup and began driving down the compound's long driveway. John Yeager, a skinhead from California, leaped into the back of the pickup, armed with a semiautomatic rifle. The Keenans fled, with the guards -- three or more in all -- in pursuit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeager, Ms. Keenan told the police, fired five rounds from the rifle as the guards bore down on her car, screaming for her to pull over. When a bullet flattened the Keenans' rear tire, their car slid into a ditch. Their pursuers ran up to them.</p>
        <p>Ms. Keenan said a man, later identified as Mr. Warfield, struck her with a rifle butt, grabbed her by the hair and screamed at her. Other men tried to pull her weeping son out of the car, she said, striking him with a bat and the butt of a rifle.</p>
        <p>A gun ''was pointed at me,'' Ms. Keenan told the authorities. ''It made me very scared. I thought I was going to die.'' She begged the men to let her son alone. After determining that the Keenans were unarmed, they relented, explaining that they were doing so because both were white, she said.</p>
        <p>Witnesses are expected to testify that as a result of the assault, Ms. Keenan and her son suffer from post-traumatic-stress disorder, depression and anxiety.</p>
        <p>In court documents, Edgar J. Steele, a lawyer representing Mr. Butler, Mr. Teague and the Aryan Nations, pointed out that on the night of the attack, the volunteer guards made no effort to notify Mr. Butler of their actions. ''Wright, Yeager and Warfield were way out of bounds,  and they knew it,'' Mr. Steele argued. ''One can only do so much.''</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Dees and his legal team were trying ''to paint this ragtag band of borderline derelicts as a highly organized, well-trained and disciplined military organization.'' That, he said, would be ''laughable if not so patently preposterous.''</p>
        <p>In the 27 years since he moved to northern Idaho from California, Mr. Butler and his organization have welcomed many white supremacists later convicted of violent crimes.</p>
        <p>One of the best known, and a model for the Oklahoma City bomber Timothy J. McVeigh, was Robert Mathews, who in 1983 formed a terrorist group known as the Order. Mr. Mathews and members of his gang robbed  armored cars, bombed a synagogue in Boise and assassinated Alan Berg, a Jewish talk-show host in Denver.  Mr. Mathews died in a siege by the F.B.I. in 1984, and other members of the organization are serving federal prison sentences of 40 to 100 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Butler himself and 12 other white supremacist leaders were arrested in 1987 on federal sedition charges but were acquitted at trial in Fort Smith, Ark.</p>
        <p>And Mark Thomas, the leader of the Aryan Nations in Pennsylvania, confessed to being part of another terrorist group, the Aryan Republican Army, that in the mid-1990's robbed 22 Midwest banks in an effort to finance a supremacist revolution.</p>
        <p>Over the last two decades, the Southern Poverty Law Center has taken a number of Klan and other hate groups to court. In 1987, for instance, the center won $7 million  for the mother of Michael Donald, a black youth lynched by members of the United Klans of America in Mobile, Ala. The group was forced to turn its headquarters over to the victim's mother, and two Klansmen were convicted of criminal charges.</p>
