        <p>With the arrival of photography in the mid-19th century, the desert entered the European imagination. Endless sand dunes in the Sahara became metaphors for the grandiosity of Nature, camel trains and nomadic tribesmen evoked romance and mystery. Of course the first desert photographers were not artists; as explorers and scientists, they were merely bent on recording the unknown and unseen. Yet their work passed one test of art: it made people dream.</p>
        <p>It is no great leap, then, a century and a half later, to commission 10 contemporary artists to travel into the desert and record their reactions to it. True, in the meantime the desert has become less of a secret, with expanses of sand now all too familiar to both tourists and moviegoers. (The desert was surely the real star of David Lean's film ''Lawrence of Arabia.'') But that is where artists come in: they can prod the collective imagination by finding fresh magic.</p>
        <p>In ''The Desert,'' a show at the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in Paris through Nov. 5, they set out to do just that. The exhibition is built around works made for the occasion as well as existing works by five other living artists, but it also provides context through a selection of remarkable photographs from the 19th and early 20th centuries. The result is to turn the familiar into a surprise, the unfamiliar into a discovery.</p>
        <p>This also happens to have become the Cartier Foundation's speciality in organizing frequent thematic shows at its gallery space in the stunning steel-and-glass building on the Boulevard Raspail that was designed by Jean Nouvel in 1994. These have included ''Like a Bird'' in 1996, ''Amours'' 1997, ''Being Nature'' in 1998 and ''A Real World'' in 1999, each devised to provide the artist's take on the commonplace. With ''The Desert,'' which will be presented at La Caixa Foundation in Barcelona early next year, the foundation has gone further by virtually creating the show through commissions.</p>
        <p>The gallery's main lobby is dominated by three screening rooms. One is given over to Bill Viola's 1979 film, ''Chott el-Djerid, a Portrait in Light and Heat,'' in which the American video artist juxtaposes wintry landscapes from North America with the mirages and shimmering light of a dried-up salt lake in southern Tunisia. Another shows ''Alice to Uluru, January '00,'' a commissioned work by the Swiss artist Beat Streuli comprising 250 slides taken during long drives through and flights over the Australian outback.</p>
        <p>Raymond Depardon's film ''Deserts,'' also made for this show, is a compilation of black-and-white photographs of mainly African deserts (and their inhabitants), accompanied by atmospheric sounds of children's voices, market cries, gunshots and wind. But the Cartier Foundation also invited the Moroccan-born artist Titouan Lamazou to travel to Timbuktu in Mali with 72 of Mr. Depardon's images and to paint his own observations on the photographs. The results add human warmth to the harshness of the environment.</p>
        <p>It is on the gallery's lower floor, though, that the timelessness of the desert comes into focus through the mixed display of old photographs and new works of art. Many of the earliest desert photographs were taken in Egypt, where new archaeological discoveries were drawing explorers and scientists. Interestingly, in their photographs of the Sphinx and pyramids at Giza, outside Cairo, Hippolyte Arnoux and J. P. Sebah made a point of including camels and people in order to convey the massiveness of the monuments.</p>
        <p>Soon photographers were venturing deeper into the deserts of North Africa, revealing the majesty of the sand dunes, although again frequently adding a human figure to show scale. Images taken in desert communities, on the other hand, often reflected an ethnographic interest in local customs and clothes. Gaetan Gatian de Clerambault, for instance, took nearly 4,000 photographs of the draped clothing of Moroccan women early in the 20th century. But he also had an artist's eye: many of his images verge on the abstract.</p>
        <p>Sir Wilfred Thesiger, the British explorer, photographer and writer (''Arabian Sands'') who is now 90, is in a sense a throwback to the first desert photographers. Still in his 30's when he discovered his ''vocation for the desert,'' as he put it, he has dedicated his writing and photography to preserving the myths and mysteries of the Arabian desert. In his images on display here, there is no heat, only silence and solitude.</p>
        <p>Balthasar Burkhard, a Swiss photographer, found a new angle, literally, by taking to the air earlier this year over the deserts of Namibia in southern Africa, capturing the light and shadows of boundless shifting sand dunes against the backdrop of arid mountains. His stunning large-format photographs are echoed in ''Drift: 29 Days, 18 hours, 2 minutes,'' a 1999 film by Michael Light, an American who has created a likeness of earthly deserts using NASA images taken on the Moon.</p>
        <p>Two other Americans were invited to meditate on the deserts of the United States for this exhibition. Lee Friedlander's black-and-white photographs of entangled desert vegetation have the abstraction of a Jackson Pollock painting. William Eggleston's color photographs of the American Southwest, on the other hand, remind one abruptly of what can happen when modern life penetrates the desert: highways, gas stations, garbage. But Walter De Maria's 1969 film ''Two Lines, Three Circles on the Desert'' puts Nature first: it shows a man walking away from the camera in the Mojave Desert until he disappears.</p>
        <p>The one artist who approached her commission with irreverence is the Egyptian photographer Lara Baladi, who went into the Libyan desert to create ''Om El Dounia'' (''Mother of the World''), a vast mosaic of photographs with highly saturated colors. From afar the work suggests sand dunes against a deep blue sky, but up close it is alive with surrealist images: a desert with mermaids, a bizarre picnic, an opium smoker, a sky where fish and clouds compete for space.</p>
        <p>Clearly an exhibition with so many works from so many periods can only aspire to the sensation of a journey through space and time, one that starts with a concrete reality and ends up with impressions and ideas. This show does that much. Reassuringly, though, it does not pretend that this journey began in the mid-19th century. The head of an ancient Egyptian mummy and an 18th-century Iranian manuscript of the Koran in so-called dust writing are timely reminders that the dead desert has always meant life, too.</p>
