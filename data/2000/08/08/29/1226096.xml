        <p>On a lunch break from excavations, Bert Smith delivered the news of discovery. The marble head of a man had been found under crumbling steps of an ancient house. The style was right, and the fit. This must be the missing piece to a headless statue of a local governor from the fifth century A.D. that had been recovered years ago.</p>
        <p>The governor's recapitation took place the next afternoon in the little museum here at Aphrodisias, one of the more important and monumentally impressive archaeological sites of the Greek and Roman periods in what is now western Turkey.</p>
        <p>Dr. R. R. R. Smith, known to all as Bert, a classical archaeologist at Oxford University in England and co-director of the current dig, lifted the head above the life-size marble body. With a few turns this way and that, the neck slipped neatly onto the rest of the statue. The governor named Oikoumenios was whole again.</p>
        <p>It was a small but satisfying triumph for archaeologists working the Aphrodisias site, a field of dreams for the study of art and architecture of antiquity. Spreading over a broad plain is an extravagance of well-preserved stone remains of a prosperous provincial city: from a huge theater on high ground to the squares and building walls of the civic center and beyond to the standing and fallen columns of the Temple of Aphrodite and then the stadium that once seated 30,000.</p>
        <p>But new discoveries in the fine arts are not as common here as they used to be. Not only have archaeologists thoroughly mined the most obvious sources, but their excavations have entered a new phase, a response in part to criticism that classical archaeology has focused too much on collecting museum pieces at the expense of exploring the societies that created them.</p>
        <p>The emphasis in recent digging seasons, organized by the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, has shifted to learning something of what the rest of Aphrodisias was like, beyond the noble architecture.</p>
        <p>''Here and elsewhere in Turkey, we are making great strides in understanding ancient cities from an urban point of view, as social entities,'' Dr. Christopher Ratte of N.Y.U., the other co-director of the project, said while walking the pavement stones of old Aphrodisias. ''We are trying to see them less as collections of monuments and more as complex urban wholes.''</p>
        <p>Toward this end, the project has completed an extensive survey, using subsurface-detection technology, of the open, unexcavated fields within the city's encompassing defensive wall. Electric currents were passed through the ground, at depths of a few feet. By measuring changes in the resistance to the current, scientists recorded variations in subsurface densities, evidence of buried building foundations and street pavements.</p>
        <p>The survey has thus far revealed a grid pattern of streets and houses in all directions from the center out to the city wall. Test trenches have confirmed the findings. Aphrodisias in its heyday was a planned city, uniform blocks running north and south and east and west like Manhattan north of 14th Street.</p>
        <p>In an article in the current issue of The American Journal of Archaeology, Dr. Smith and Dr. Ratte reported that excavations guided by the survey had yielded additional evidence suggesting that ''both the city center and the residential areas of Aphrodisias remained occupied and relatively prosperous through the sixth and into the seventh century, before suffering a sudden and dramatic change of fortune.''</p>
        <p>One of the trenches being explored this summer yielded marble slabs of a street, drain pipes and the stone side of a house near the stadium. Other excavations have uncovered a coin hoard showing that many of the houses were built before the early fifth century A.D. Elsewhere, coins, pottery and metal objects of rooms date the latest occupation of the buildings to the early seventh century.</p>
        <p>The plan is to dig more of the houses of ordinary people that have shown up in the survey, while continuing to catalog and analyze the sculpture that has accumulated since systematic excavations began here in 1961.</p>
        <p>The excavations were directed for two decades by Dr. Kenan T. Erim, a Turkish-born archaeologist at N.Y.U. whose main interest was sculpture.</p>
        <p>From what has been learned so far, Aphrodisias was built on the site of a rural sanctuary where the goddess Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, was worshiped. But anyone coming here expecting to find voluptuary art, recipes for love potions or evidence of ancient orgies will be disappointed. A commanding statue of Aphrodite here shows a robust, fully robed goddess bearing little resemblance to the Aphrodite or Venus of the Greek and Roman traditions.</p>
        <p>''At lectures, I'm invariably asked about Aphrodite,'' Dr. Ratte said. ''Did they practice ritual prostitution here? Not likely. This Aphrodite was not your sex goddess of Greek religion. She was a very local deity, stemming from the goddess Cybele of Asia Minor, who became associated with Aphrodite but never lost her local character.''</p>
        <p>The native gods of this region were usually conceived of as feminine, Dr. Ratte noted, although they were not all fertility goddesses.</p>
        <p>This Aphrodite appeared to be a warrior goddess and protector of the place. ''It may be sexism to be viewing them always as goddesses of fertility,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As a city, Aphrodisias had the good fortune to lie in the fertile Meander River Valley, off the beaten track of invading armies -- the ruins are 100 miles southeast of the Aegean port of Izmir, ancient Smyrna. It came into its own in the time of Emperor Augustus in the late first century B.C.  ''I have selected this one city from all of Asia to be my own,'' Augustus declared in offering the city patronage and special protection.</p>
        <p>And so the people of Aphrodisias, living near a quarry, celebrated themselves and the good times of Roman rule with a profusion of fine marble statues to gods, heroes, emperors and philosophers.</p>
        <p>This proved to be a gift to archaeologists, especially because the city is all but ignored in surviving texts.</p>
        <p>''This is a statue culture, for which statues are a currency of life and politics,'' Dr. Smith explained. ''If you are a great benefactor to the city, you will be honored with a public statue. This was typical after Alexander the Great. Greek democratic culture before frowned on this practice.''</p>
        <p>One of the more generous benefactors in the city's building boom seems to have been a man whose name and likeness appears on statues and a frieze found near the fortification wall. He was Ziolus, who was born here, became a slave in Rome and returned rich after being freed by Augustus. He was credited with financing the 7,000-seat theater and other buildings.</p>
        <p>Even though they are moving in other research directions, the archaeologists defended their studies of the elite artifacts as sources of valuable insights into a culture: what people did with their surplus wealth, how the leading citizens conceived of themselves and how the aristocracy sought to perpetuate itself.</p>
        <p>''What is really best preserved at Aphrodisias is the kind of material evidence for the high civic culture,'' Dr. Ratte said. ''We don't learn much about ancient diet or living arrangements from it, or anything about the common people. But that does not mean beautiful objects and monumental buildings are just art history, and not of anthropological interest.''</p>
        <p>For example, the stadium, an oval of gray stone the length of two American football fields, was built in the first century A.D. with a seating capacity far greater than the population of the city and its environs, probably about 10,000. Too big and impractical?</p>
        <p>''The fact that you could build it when you didn't need it, THAT was the point,'' Dr. Ratte said.</p>
        <p>A prominent edifice in the civic center is the Sebasteion, a kind of hall-of-fame to Roman emperors and other worthies, also built in the first century A.D. From the layout of the ruins and the many statues found there, Harry Mark, a Dallas architect trained in archaeological research, has prepared detailed drawings of what the colonnaded courtyard and temple looked like.</p>
        <p>In a storage depot, Dr. Smith pointed out the marble reliefs with scenes from Greek mythology and depictions of Roman emperors in heroic, godlike poses that once graced the Sebasteion. Here the Aphrodisians are presumably revealed trying to come to terms with those who held power not only over themselves but virtually the whole world as it was known to them.</p>
        <p>''So they represented them as gods,'' Dr. Ratte said, ''not just to flatter the Romans but to make sense of the Romans to themselves.''</p>
        <p>Changes in who was honored with statues seemed to mark a significant transition in the city's government. After about A.D. 200, the tradition of memorializing the local aristocracy largely disappeared.</p>
        <p>Governors appointed by Rome or, later, Constantinople became the more usual subjects of statues. The city, archaeologists surmise, had become less self-reliant and more dependent on imperial administration and favor.</p>
        <p>In the late fourth or early fifth centuries, statues of two governors, including Oikoumenios, were erected on inscribed bases in a place of honor between the public square and the council house.</p>
        <p>It was here that the headless statue of Oikoumenios was found in 1965. A team of workers under Michelle Berenfeld, a doctoral student in archaeology at N.Y.U., came upon the head 40 feet away, where it had long ago been dumped with dirt and other stones as construction fill at the house of a prominent official.</p>
        <p>The Temple of Aphrodite itself underwent a transformation around A.D. 500, reflecting a major change in the city's religion. As archaeologists and architects have determined, some of the columns on the east and west sides were dismantled and re-erected along the north-south sides in such a way as to turn the temple into a much larger church. The Christians of Byzantium were making an ideological statement in stone.</p>
        <p>Archaeologists and other scholars cannot account for the city's sharp decline. In the early seventh century, most of the Aphrodisians moved out into the countryside. By the 13th century, the place was completely abandoned, prey to pillagers, many of its proudly carved stones burned into lime.</p>
        <p>Nor is it clear, after 40 years of excavations, what moved the Aphrodisians to such exuberant expressions in stone. They were not powerful, or especially rich. Perhaps others in the region were like them, who built in the spirit of Greece and thrived under Rome, but time was not as kind to the ruins of their cities.</p>
        <p>The British writer Freya Stark came away from a visit to unexcavated Aphrodisias in the 1950's with the impression that its people had lived ''in undistinguished mediocrity and wealth, enjoying their world and untroubled by its opinions, except for a reasonable municipal pride in their city and its credit abroad.''</p>
        <p>In ''Ionia: A Quest,'' Ms. Stark praised this attitude, in contrast to what she called the inferiority complexes bred by the modern age of doubt.</p>
        <p>The Aphrodisians, she wrote, must have ''had an inner security through all the centuries of their submissions, because of that genial interest in things for their own sake, which remained.''</p>
        <p>One evening, after another day of digging among the stones under a blazing sun, the archaeologists and architects of the project, their students and some visitors also seemed to take a genial interest in things for their own sake. The dinner had been simple, as usual. But spirits were enlivened by port and fine Stilton cheese, a gift of Trevor Proudfoot, a stone conservator who had arrived from England.</p>
        <p>Talk turned to the Aphrodisians. Were they an exceptional culture? Not really. ''They were no more peace loving than others,'' Dr. Ratte said. ''It's just that they came into prominence at a time of great stability.''</p>
        <p>But everyone agreed that the city's ruins were extraordinary, so well-preserved and accessible, and that they might someday produce insights into what made the Aphrodisians recognize stability as a condition worth celebrating. For now, though, the archaeologists lifted their glasses. It was satisfying to have the governor's head replaced, a museum and storehouse full of sculpture and the new survey showing the way to future exploration of Aphrodisias.</p>
