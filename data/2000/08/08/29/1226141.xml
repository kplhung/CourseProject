        <p>In an abrupt reversal, a state security court today dismissed an arrest warrant for an Islamic leader accused by prosecutors of trying to overthrow the secular government.</p>
        <p>The court here said the case against the leader, Fetullah Gulen, was too weak to support the warrant.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nuh Mete Yuksel, said the decision was wrong and pledged to open a new investigation into the activities of Mr. Gulen and his followers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gulen's lawyers said the decision would prevent the prosecutor from starting another inquiry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulen, 62, is a prominent Islamic leader who has been friendly with senior politicians and religious leaders. He is the spiritual leader of a loosely knit Islamic community that operates hundreds of schools in Turkey, the Balkans and Central Asia, as well as other businesses.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Yuksel, a prosecutor for the security court in Ankara, opened a criminal investigation of Mr. Gulen after television stations broadcast excerpts from videocassettes in which he seemed to urge followers to be patient in infiltrating government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yuksel said his inquiry found that Mr. Gulen had plotted to replace the secular government with an Islamic regime, a crime punishable by death. His effort to obtain an arrest warrant for Mr. Gulen was rejected by a court in Ankara. But on Aug. 11, a second court there agreed to issue the warrant, though no formal charges were specified.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulen's lawyers appealed the decision, and the security court here reviewed the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, denied the accusations last week and said his enemies had altered the videos. He said he only wanted Turkey to be more tolerant of ethnic and religious diversity. He has been receiving medical care in the United States for the last year.</p>
