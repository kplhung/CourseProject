      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial scores CIA for reneging on pledge to cooperate in declassifying secret documents relating to political violence in Chile, notably covert actions that helped destabilize Socialist government of Salvador Allende and support Gen Augusto Pinochet's repressive security forces after his 1973 coup (S)</p>

        <p>When President Clinton first promised that the administration would declassify secret documents on political violence in Chile, the Central Intelligence Agency pledged to cooperate. Now it is breaking that promise with regard to the most important information -- documents about covert operations to destabilize the Socialist government of Salvador Allende and support Augusto Pinochet's repressive security forces after his 1973 coup.</p>
        <p>Although the State Department has cooperated in full, the C.I.A. argued that the president's directive did not cover most files on its own operations. After howls from Congress, human rights advocates and State Department officials, the C.I.A. last year agreed to review and release those files. Its declassification experts marked hundreds of documents for release on Sept. 14 and deleted their references to confidential sources and methods.</p>

        <p>When President Clinton first promised that the administration would declassify secret documents on political violence in Chile, the Central Intelligence Agency pledged to cooperate. Now it is breaking that promise with regard to the most important information -- documents about covert operations to destabilize the Socialist government of Salvador Allende and support Augusto Pinochet's repressive security forces after his 1973 coup.</p>
        <p>Although the State Department has cooperated in full, the C.I.A. argued that the president's directive did not cover most files on its own operations. After howls from Congress, human rights advocates and State Department officials, the C.I.A. last year agreed to review and release those files. Its declassification experts marked hundreds of documents for release on Sept. 14 and deleted their references to confidential sources and methods.</p>
        <p>The C.I.A. is still planning to release files on its covert operations to keep Mr. Allende from taking power after winning the 1970 election. But George Tenet, director of central intelligence, has blocked release of hundreds of other documents on covert actions both before and after General Pinochet came to power on grounds that the documents illustrate a ''pattern of activity'' that reveals ''intelligence methods that have been employed worldwide.''</p>
        <p>But as the National Security Archive, a nongovernmental group that fought for declassification, points out, the methods these documents describe were publicly revealed a quarter-century ago by a Senate select committee on intelligence. There is no good reason to withhold documents that would help Chileans and Americans understand their past.</p>
        <p>After a public outcry earlier this month, the administration set up an interagency panel to look at the documents and recommend to Mr. Tenet which of them should be declassified. President Clinton should instruct him to declassify the documents. Mr. Tenet insists he is not simply trying to cover up actions that were an embarrassment to the United States. But it sure looks that way, and his defiance of the presidential order for openness adds a new embarrassment to the list.</p>
