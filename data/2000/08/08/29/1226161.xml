        <p>DAUGHTER hailed mother on the cell phone, in Miami, at the airport, with the flash that was no longer news.</p>
        <p>''She already knew I won,'' said Allison Bradshaw, looking every bit the 19-year-old whose family surprise was ruined.</p>
        <p>An anxious mother can only stand so much. The minute Valerie Ziegenfuss landed, shuffling her national team of 14-and-under players off the flight from Prague and through immigration, she switched on the phone, and found the messages from the National Tennis Center.</p>
        <p>Two other United States Tennis Association coaches and Lynne Rolley, the director of programs, had already reported Bradshaw's 6-4, 6-2 first-round takeout of France's Sarah Pitkowski in her Grand Slam debut at the United States Open.</p>
        <p>''Allison reached me at the baggage claim, but we could only talk for a couple of minutes because I had to check in for the flight home to San Diego,'' Ziegenfuss said by phone, about to board. ''After we hung up, I started thinking that people in the press might be asking her questions that she doesn't know the answer to. I guess it's time I start filling her in.''</p>
        <p>Ziegenfuss never decorated the house with trophies, with photos, with reminders that her daughter had any path to follow but her own. She made a point of not regaling her with 30-year-old tales of a very different time. Yet now that Bradshaw had an Open victory under her belt, now that she was part of a tour that keeps redefining itself, keeps growing, she ought to know how it all came to be.</p>
        <p>''I want to know more, considering my mom was involved,'' Bradshaw said. ''But more because everyone on the tour should try to learn about what Billie Jean King and the rest of them did.''</p>
        <p>She knows her mother was in Houston, with King and Rosie Casals and the publisher Gladys Heldman, leaders of nine breakaway players who in 1970 rebelled against the U.S.T.A. and shunned a tour stop in Los Angeles. While the U.S.T.A. was paying the women about one-tenth what it gave the men, Heldman put up $5,000 of her own money and the players signed $1 contracts. They were banned by the U.S.T.A., told they had committed career suicide.</p>
        <p>Soon, Ziegenfuss said, she would have to tell her daughter of the anxious phone calls and the late-night fears and the uncompromising faith in Heldman and King that ultimately pulled them through.</p>
        <p>Four times in the top 10 in singles and No. 1-ranked in doubles, Ziegenfuss lost to Rosie Casals that week in Houston and guessed she made $300. For surviving one round after receiving a wild card into the main draw, her daughter yesterday guaranteed herself at least a $19,000 Open haul.</p>
        <p>''Am I amazed by the prize money?'' Ziegenfuss said. ''Yes. But I'm more amazed by the level of play. Not in my wildest dreams did I ever hit a forehand like my daughter, and she's not one of the top players.''</p>
        <p>As the Open slogged its way out of the starting gate, it began with one potential response to Tigermania, to the kind of attention golf gets, and that would be a women's final of Williams versus Williams. For all of Pete Sampras's 13-Slam greatness and Andre Agassi's inherent appeal, the men's game has stooped to a new publicity campaign directed at those preoccupied with the wrestlers, the rappers and other renowned reapers of the attention the men don't command. ''New Balls, Please'' sounds more like an excerpt from Bob Knight's autobiography than a sound marketing plan for tennis.</p>
        <p>The transcendent superstar doesn't achieve the big television rating by merely taking off his (or her) shirt. You either have a compelling product, or you don't.</p>
        <p>''What we're seeing from Venus and Serena is so far athletically beyond anything we knew back then,'' Ziegenfuss said.</p>
        <p>Bradshaw, who first beat her mother when she was 12 or 13, is 5 feet 10 inches, with reddish hair and an aggressive style. ''I don't get nervous,'' she said, after proving it by ignoring the noise pollution around Court 18, a bathroom dash by the 24-year-old Pitkowski after Bradshaw had won 12 of 15 points to ice the first set and an ensuing rain delay.</p>
        <p>After winning a Challenger event earlier this summer after leaving Arizona State, she's come a long way without Virginia Slims, and does not even consider herself a feminist. Here at the Open, the one Grand Slam event that pays equal prize money, she doesn't have to be.</p>
        <p>Ziegenfuss will be here tomorrow to tell her daughter more about how this all came about.</p>
