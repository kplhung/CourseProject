        <p>Major stock market gauges crept close to record levels yesterday.</p>

        <p>Major stock market gauges crept close to record levels yesterday.</p>
        <p>Led by American Express and General Motors, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 60.21 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,252.84. The gain put the blue-chip index less than 30 points from its April 11 high of 11,287.08.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index also neared record levels, climbing 7.64 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,514.09. Gains in EMC, General Electric and Oracle pulled the index higher. Its peak of 1,527.46 was set on March 24.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index rose for the 10th time in the last 12 sessions, gaining 27.91 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,070.59. The advance put the Nasdaq ahead for the year.</p>
        <p>So far this year, the Nasdaq is up 0.03 percent; the S.&amp; P. 500 is up 3.1 percent; and the Dow is down 2.1 percent.</p>
        <p>With many traders on vacation, volume was light. On the New York Stock Exchange, some 733.6 million shares changed hands.</p>
        <p>''You love to see an up market, but with the volume as poor as it is, it is difficult to tell what it means,'' said Ned Collins, head trader at Daiwa Securities America.</p>
        <p>With activity at a fairly low ebb, Mr. Collins and other traders said there were no real problems with the introduction of decimalization on 13 listed stocks. But they said a bigger challenge could well come at the end of next month, when a much larger group of stocks is scheduled to be quoted in pennies instead of fractions.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to draw any earth-shattering conclusions,'' said Michael Clark, head of global stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''There is a reason they decided to introduce this in late summer, when the volumes are low.''</p>
        <p>Among Dow stocks, American Express rose $3.38, to $59.94 a share. I.B.M. gained $1.63, to $130.63, after an analyst from Credit Suisse First Boston said the stock could reach $150 a share over the next 12 months. G.M. gained $3.06, to $74.50.</p>
        <p>Intel, Microsoft and Cisco Systems, were the most actively traded issues yesterday.</p>
        <p>Intel gained 94 cents, to $73.88; Microsoft rose 69 cents, to $71.31; and Cisco Systems closed at $66.06, up 56 cents.</p>
        <p>Yahoo was a big decliner among technology stocks.</p>
        <p>The stock plunged $12.19, to $122.06, after an analyst at Lehman Brothers said problems for Yahoo, the largest Internet search company, continued to worsen because of sluggish advertising revenue growth.</p>
        <p>But it was a very good day for brokerage firms and financial services stocks.</p>
        <p>Merrill Lynch rose $3.09, to $140.47; Lehman Brothers jumped $3.44, to $137.25; Goldman Sachs closed at $122, up $2.63; and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette gained $4.69, to $65.81.</p>
        <p>''Leadership has clearly shifted to sectors that are interest rate sensitive,'' said Jim Paulson, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. ''I think we are going to new highs.''</p>
        <p>THE MARKETS: STOCKS &amp; BONDS  Correction:  August 31, 2000, Thursday  An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the daily performance of the stock market misstated the record high for the Dow Jones industrial average. It was 11,722.98 points in January, not 11,287.08 in April.</p>
