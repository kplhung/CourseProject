        <p>U.S. Believes Submarine Was Sunk by Bad Torpdeo  Acoustical tapes made by the American submarine Memphis in the Barents Sea and by other vessels are the source of the American theory that a faulty torpedo caused the explosion that sank the Russian submarine Kursk, American officials said. They said the evidence did not support Russian suggestions that a collision with another sub, a ship or some other object had occurred.</p>

        <p>Retrial for New Yorker in Peru  A military tribunal has rescinded the life sentence of Lori Berenson, 30, a New York woman accused of terrorism and treason, and granted her a new trial in civilian courts. But human rights organizations cautioned that the decision did not mean she would get a fair trial. In 1996, Ms. Berenson was tried in secret before a tribunal of military judges wearing ski masks to conceal their identities. Her lawyers were not permitted to cross-examine witnesses.</p>
