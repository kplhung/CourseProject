        <p>The New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. will undertake an ambitious effort to create thousands of housing units for middle- and low-income workers, its president announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Denis M. Hughes, the labor federation's president, said many union members were having a hard time finding housing they could afford, notwithstanding a decade-long economic boom. He said the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., which represents more than two million union members, plans to work with nonprofit developers and community and political leaders to create an independent agency that would build housing.</p>
        <p>''The time has come to gain affordable, safe housing for our members and their families,'' Mr. Hughes said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes said he hoped to name a group of experts to set up and run the agency. He also suggested that money from union pension funds might be used to finance construction of housing units around the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes announced the housing plan during the federation's convention at the Sheraton New York Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, where he was re-elected as the federation's president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes also announced an initiative to pressure the State Legislature for a law requiring all employers to give workers at least one day off every week. Many farm workers in upstate New York complain that they often toil up to four weeks in a row without a day off.</p>
        <p>Last year, the state labor federation failed to win passage of such a law.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, convention delegates also heard from Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic nominee for the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said that if the union leaders in the audience worked hard to elect her in November, she would work hard to represent the interests of union members.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton tailored her speech to  the union audience, which responded enthusiastically. She said she wanted tougher job safety laws, more money for the National Labor Relations Board and laws to make it easier to organize more workers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes pledged the labor movement's support to Mrs. Clinton.</p>
