        <p>Opponents dealt sharp blows to the government of President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim el-Hoss, results of the first round of parliamentary elections showed today.</p>
        <p>The voting, on Sunday, was for 63 seats in northern Lebanon, the Christian heartland of Mount Lebanon and the Shuf region, home to the Druse, a Muslim offshoot. Of those, 33 appeared to have been won by candidates either critical of the government or in some form of alliance with Rafik Hariri, the multibillionaire builder who has conducted a free-spending campaign to regain the prime minister's office. The newspapers this morning, based on early results, spoke of a ''stunning rout'' of the government.</p>
        <p>In elections next Sunday for the rest of the 128-seat legislature, Mr. Hariri is fielding a slate of 18 candidates for the 19 seats that represent Beirut. There will also be elections for the Bekaa region and southern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The heavy opposition vote does not immediately appear to threaten the dominance of Lebanon by Syria, which has exercised total power here for a decade, political experts said. Nearly all the candidates have ties to Syria, though to varying degrees.</p>
        <p>But the results do present a problem for the new Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, who took office after his tough, wily father died in June.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lahoud, a former army commander installed by Syria as president in 1998, detests Mr. Hariri and appears determined to thwart any comeback attempt. But Mr. Hariri could amass a large enough bloc in Parliament to demand the prime minister's office. And Syria may be inclined to look favorably on him as the only figure who might possibly help Lebanon out of its deepening economic crisis.</p>
