        <p>The Museum of Modern Art and the union representing its 250 administrative workers will hold negotiations next week in what will be the first face-to-face talks between the two sides since the union went out on strike four months ago, management and union officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Robert Batterman, the museum's chief negotiator, said in an interview that he contacted a federal mediator last week to tell her that the museum thought it was time for her to bring the two sides together.</p>
        <p>In recent months, negotiators for the two sides said that the mediator, Kathleen Murray-Cannon, has repeatedly declined to bring the two sides together because she did not think such a meeting would result in meaningful progress.</p>
        <p>Maida Rosenstein, president of the union local representing the strikers, said the museum requested the negotiations because of two recent union successes in pressuring, even embarrassing, the museum.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, the union, Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers, released a letter signed by 125 prominent artists that criticized the museum for refusing to negotiate.</p>
        <p>The letter, which also asked the public to honor the picket line in front of the museum, was signed by, among others, Robert Rauschenberg, Barbara Kruger, Eric Fischl, Sol LeWitt, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Laurie Anderson, David Byrne, Bill T. Jones and Susan Sontag.</p>
        <p>Mr. Batterman said, ''Of course the museum was troubled by the fact that 125 artists signed such a letter. It is unfortunate that they didn't have all the facts. The letter proceeded from a totally fallacious assumption, namely that the museum was refusing to negotiate.''</p>
        <p>And last week, after intense lobbying by the union, the Manhattan members of the City Council failed to give the museum majority backing for the zoning variance it needs for its more than $600 million renovation and expansion project.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the whole City Council votes against granting a zoning variance when a majority of the delegation from the affected borough fails to recommend such a variance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Batterman said neither the artists' letter nor the action by the Manhattan council members caused the museum to ask for the talks. Rather, he said, the museum asked to resume negotiations because he thought it was wrong that no talks have been held for such a long time.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Rosenstein insisted that the museum that had repeatedly blocked any resumption of talks.</p>
        <p>On April 28, the union, which represents librarians, assistant curators, visitor assistants, bookstore workers and others began its strike. About half of the 250 workers represented by the bargaining unit since returned to work.</p>
        <p>Since the strike began, workers have often shouted and banged steel bars in front of the museum. The workers are demanding that health benefits remain intact without any reductions and that all newly hired administrative workers be required to join the union or pay union dues. The union also wants management to agree to rehire all workers who will be laid off during the renovation project, which will entail closing large parts of the museum.</p>
        <p>Dozens of labor leaders attending the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in Manhattan joined the strikers yesterday afternoon to picket in front of the museum.</p>
