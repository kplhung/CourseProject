        <p>Black students who switched to private schools from public schools on scholarships that were similar to vouchers performed significantly higher on standardized math and reading tests than similar students who remained in public schools, a study released yesterday says.</p>
        <p>The two-year study of students in three cities, by researchers at Harvard University, Georgetown University and the University of Wisconsin, found that the average performance of the black students who switched to private school was 6 percentile points higher than that of students who stayed in public schools.</p>
        <p>The study, which followed students in voucher programs aimed at children from poor families in New York City, Washington and Dayton, Ohio, found no significant overall gains among students in other ethic groups who moved to private schools from public schools. The greatest gains for black students were in Washington.</p>
        <p>The findings are expected to be cited by advocates of vouchers for public school students during the current election season, particularly as the two major presidential candidates stake out opposing positions on school vouchers.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee, supports vouchers that poor families can use for private-school tuition, saying it will force public schools to improve. His Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, says vouchers will drain needed resources from public schools.</p>
        <p>Unlike many previous studies of the effects of school vouchers, students in the new study were randomly selected to receive the privately financed scholarships and then were compared with students who applied for them but did not receive them.</p>
        <p>Most of the students in the New York City and Washington programs received vouchers paid for by Ted Forstmann and John Walton, the businessmen and philanthropists who founded the Children's Scholarship Fund.</p>
        <p>Paul E. Peterson, the Harvard researcher who was one of four authors of the report and the principal investigator in each of the three cities, said in an interview yesterday that the study provided evidence that private-school vouchers can help to achieve ''a nontrivial closing of the gap'' in achievement between black students and the rest of the population.</p>
        <p>Groups that opposed vouchers criticized the study, with some noting that among those who helped pay for it were several conservative research groups and voucher advocates, including the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation and the Milton and Rose D. Friedman Foundation.</p>
        <p>The study's results raised questions about why blacks who moved to private schools improved so much more than students from other ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, in Washington, where the improvement among black students was twice as great as in New York City and one-third greater than in Dayton, the reading scores of black students declined sharply in the first year that they attended private school. Only after the second year did those students record the gains that were the highest of any ethnic group in any city over the entire two-year study.</p>
        <p>Dr. Peterson explained the anomaly by saying that some students might have had difficulty in adjusting to private school during the first year.</p>
        <p>And, Dr. Peterson said, when the researchers asked the parents of all voucher recipients in New York City about the differences between their children's private schools and their former public schools, parents of black voucher recipients were more likely to cite differences in discipline, specifically less fighting, property destruction and racial conflict at the private schools.</p>
        <p>Other education experts raised questions about why some 20 percent of students dropped out of the study, either by returning to public school after the first year or by receiving a voucher but choosing not to attend private school.</p>
        <p>Dr. Peterson attributed those results to the fact that voucher recipients typically had to contribute about half of the private-school tuition, or received vouchers but could not find space at a conveniently located private school. In any case, he said, those results were accounted for in the researchers' analysis.</p>
