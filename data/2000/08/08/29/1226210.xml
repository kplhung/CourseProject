        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Simple Method Found to Increase Crop Yields Vastly,'' (Aug. 22): As an ecologist who works with indigenous peoples on questions of ecosystem management, I was somewhat taken aback by the statement that the study on crop yields produced a ''stunning new result.''</p>
        <p>While the scale of the experiment is certainly new, the knowledge that diversity provides for higher productivity and greater protection against disease in both natural and agricultural ecosystems is far older than the field of ecology.</p>
        <p>Consider, for example, the original cropping technique that was practiced by Native Americans of New England.</p>
        <p>Retrospective analyses have demonstrated that the original ''simple'' mixed cropping system was more efficient than the separate fields of individual crops of the colonists' agricultural system which, of course, eventually prevailed and persists to this day.</p>
        <p>That Western scientific methods are now used to verify this sort of ''traditional ecological knowledge'' does not make the knowledge new. It simply corroborates what has been apparent for millennia for those who have cared to notice.</p>
