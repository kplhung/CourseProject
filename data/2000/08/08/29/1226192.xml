        <p>The second most popular kind of drug used to lower high blood pressure is less effective than other drugs in preventing heart attacks and heart failure, according to a study being reported today.</p>
        <p>The use of such drugs, known as calcium channel blockers, is leading to nearly 85,000 avoidable heart attacks and cases of heart failure each year worldwide, with half the cases in the United States, a group of researchers are reporting at a meeting of the European Cardiology Society.</p>
        <p>An estimated 28 million people worldwide, including 12.7 million in the United States, take calcium channel blockers to lower high blood pressure and for other reasons like relieving the pain of angina.</p>
        <p>The findings are expected to extend the debate over the safety and effectiveness of calcium channel blockers to treat high blood pressure, which is also called hypertension.</p>
