        <p>Reacting to an announcement from Loews Cineplex Entertainment that it might default on its debt, Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services yesterday lowered its rating of the company's bonds to B from BB--.</p>
        <p>Loews, one of the country's largest movie exhibitors, with 2,967 screens in 385 locations, said on Friday that its second-quarter earnings would be considerably lower than last year's and that it was seeking ''alternative arrangements'' with its lenders to head off a default.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, most of Loews's major competitors have either filed for bankruptcy protection or acknowledged that they were in serious trouble because of the rapid expansion of multiplexes.</p>
        <p>Loews executives declined to comment yesterday. But in the statement issued Friday, Lawrence J. Ruisi, the company's president and chief executive, said revenue was down because of the disappointing summer box office as well as the ''continued decay at our older theaters that are experiencing competition from newer megaplexes.'' Most Loews theaters are in major metropolitan areas.</p>
        <p>Overall grosses on movies released since Memorial Day are about 4 percent less than in the period a year earlier -- $2.5 billion, compared with $2.7 billion -- said Paul Dergarabedian, the president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks box-office performance. Attendance for the year so far is down about 1.5 percent, but revenue has increased by about 2 percent because of higher ticket prices, he said.</p>
        <p>Christopher P. Dixon, an analyst with PaineWebber, said the industry was suffering because cinema chains built too many costly theaters with stadium seating and other amenities. ''They cannot blame it on the box office,'' he said. ''That's absolute nonsense.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dixon said that there were now 37,000 movie screens in the United States and Canada, but the industry could support only about 28,000. He and other analysts said that Loews and its competitors had not moved swiftly enough to close older theaters that are at a disadvantage in competing with newer moviehouses.</p>
        <p>But Steve Wilkinson, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, said that Loews had been more aggressive than other operators in shutting down theaters. Chains are often saddled with long-term leases that are not easy to break, analysts said.</p>
        <p>In a recent filing with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, Loews said it was committed to spending $361.9 million to build 34 theaters with 517 screens. The company also said it owed $133.5 million for capital spending on theater projects in various stages of development.</p>
        <p>Loews said it was seeking other sources of revenue in addition to ticket and food sales. In May, for example, the company signed a long-term advertising deal that it said was worth about $60 million.</p>
