        <p>Efes Uyanmaz threaded his way up the embankment, dodging piles of trash and excrement to reach the hole in the wall. Pulling back a dingy sheet that partially concealed the opening, he gestured inside and said, ''This is where we live.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Uyanmaz is the leader of an ad hoc family of 15 young men and children who make their home in this ancient wall four blocks from Taksim Square, one of the city's busiest intersections. They sleep on four filthy couches, an armchair and the floor. When a couch becomes too decrepit or a water bottle is emptied, the remains are tossed onto the heap outside the entrance.</p>
        <p>At 26, Mr. Uyanmaz is a wily veteran of 15 years on the streets who shares his survival skills with the newcomers fleeing abusive parents or poverty, or just looking to get high. He is neither proud nor ashamed of where he lives or of what he does. He scarcely remembers any other life.</p>
        <p>Istanbul is crowded with thousands of these street children. Some are as young as 6 or 7, turned loose by parents to make a few dollars a day selling chewing gum or tissues to kindhearted passers-by. Others are older and harder, graduates of hawking trinkets who are no longer children at all. Often they are addicted to paint thinner or drugs. Instead of selling, they resort to begging or stealing.</p>
        <p>The children are the most visible part of the population. They swarm heedlessly into traffic when lights turn red, pleading with drivers and passengers to pay a few cents for a packet of tissues or a piece of gum. They slip into restaurants and stores in twos and threes, pestering patrons and angering owners with their persistent pitch.</p>
        <p>No one has bothered to count them, but everyone in the field says the problem has grown dramatically in recent years. At the rate of about a thousand a day, people have been leaving the country's impoverished rural villages, piling onto buses and trains in search of a better life in its great and swollen cosmopolitan city. Just as in other big cities around the world, street children are at the bottom of this heap of humanity, easily ignored until something happens.</p>
        <p>In Istanbul something happened last week. A 10-year-old girl selling gum inside a McDonald's restaurant was forced into the refrigerator by the manager and an employee. Customers summoned the police, and the girl was released unharmed three hours later. The two men were jailed and may face criminal charges.</p>
        <p>The incident generated widespread publicity, and the outcry grew with the discovery that the girl's parents had willingly sent her out daily to make money.</p>
        <p>The government responded. Istanbul municipal authorities made it a crime to buy goods from street children and imposed penalties on parents who allow their children to sell on the streets. This afternoon the police swept through Taksim Square and other busy neighborhoods, rounding up street sellers. By evening the familiar swarms of children were gone.</p>
        <p>Hasan Gemici, Turkey's minister for women and family affairs, said today that civic organizations and local government must shoulder some responsibility for dealing with the thousands of street children. And he criticized parents for having more children than they can rear properly.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Uyanmaz, who came here alone from the central Anatolian city of Kayseri when he was 11, the crackdown was familiar. The police periodically chase away the street children, who always come back when the heat dies down.</p>
        <p>But for the first time, Mr. Uyanmaz is trying to break the cycle for himself and the members of his informal family. He has joined nearly 200 young street people who are registered for help and training at a center called the Hope for Children Association. Mr. Uyanmaz hopes to learn carpentry and get a job.</p>
        <p>Yusuf Kulca, the founder of the association and a former street child, said that for too long, the pattern has been predictable and inevitable. Children start out selling goods to help their families, but they come to enjoy the freedom and easy money and become permanent citizens of the streets. They grow up almost wild, without education or social skills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kulca's association tries to stop the inevitable, at least on a small scale. Street children and young adults who come to the building near Taksim Square get a meal, a haircut and a bath while their clothes are laundered. They learn basic social skills and are informed about sexually transmitted diseases and other dangers of street life. A doctor visits once a week.</p>
        <p>''If they don't smell and their clothes are clean,'' Mr. Kulca said, ''they can get on buses and go into cafeterias for food.''</p>
        <p>The doors opened three months ago with a $96,000 grant from the World Bank. Job training and education classes are scheduled to start in two weeks. Mr. Kulca says there is no similar center anywhere else in Turkey.</p>
        <p>Even a few hours out of harm's way lets some children dream. On Mr. Kulca's office wall are crayon drawings by the street children. One depicts a beach lined with palm trees. Another shows a stick figure beside a house in a garden, and a third shows a house tucked into the mountains.</p>
        <p>There are other measures of success, too.</p>
        <p>''Twenty-seven kids have returned to their families,'' Mr. Kulca said. ''We didn't force them. They wanted to go home. It's a small number, but it's a start.''</p>
