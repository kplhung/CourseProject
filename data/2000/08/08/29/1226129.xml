        <p>Shares of the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation tumbled today, as speculation mounted that the company's president would resign after the Tokyo police raided its corporate headquarters.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mitsubishi Motors denied that the president, Katsuhiko Kawasoe, would resign to take responsibility for a scandal that erupted last week when the company admitted that it had covered up customer complaints and auto defects for more than two decades.</p>
        <p>Still, shares of Mitsubishi fell more than 12 percent in trading here -- its sharpest decline since March 1998.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, investigators from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police searched the company's headquarters and  factories, as well as homes of executives. They took piles of conference minutes, floppy disks and other materials. It was the first such search since Japan introduced its current law on automotive recalls in 1969.  The police had been expected to act on a complaint from the Ministry of Transportation, which was due early next month, but they did not wait.</p>
        <p>For 23 years, Mitsubishi Motors had hidden the bulk of its documents on customer complaints from the sight of the regulators who routinely visited the company for on-site inspections. In 1992, the automaker incorporated the cover-up process into its computer system, maintaining a dual set of records on customer complaints: those to be reported to the authorities and those to be hidden.</p>
        <p>In a statement today, the company president, Mr. Kawasoe, expressed his ''deepest apologies'' for the trouble his company caused customers and other parties involved. ''I shall personally assume full responsibility  for doing everything necessary to regain the trust and confidence of customers and all who have dealings with the company,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>The leading financial daily, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported today that the chief executives of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and the Mitsubishi Corporation had met with Mr. Kawasoe, and that he had expressed his willingness to resign to take responsibility.</p>
        <p>Aside from serving as major  stockholders, the leading Mitsubishi companies carry a strong voice in the decision making of other companies in the group, like Mitsubishi Motors, which was once a division of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.</p>
        <p>''The meeting was held so that Mitsubishi Motors could report about the affair'' to Mitsubishi companies, said Wataru Ichikawa, public relations manager at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. He declined to discuss the content of the talk.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that Mitsubishi group companies were concerned that the scandal might taint the Mitsubishi name and that they began to sense a need for a drastic measure like the resignation of the company's president.</p>
