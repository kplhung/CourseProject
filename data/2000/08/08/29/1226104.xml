        <p>Going West  Van Gogh, El Greco, Picasso, Degas, Manet and Cezanne are going to spend a few months in Las Vegas. A hotel exhibition of 26 of their major paintings and sculptures from the Phillips Collection in Washington begins on Friday at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, a noncommercial exhibition space in the Bellagio, which opened in 1998. On view through March 4, ''Masterworks From the Phillips Collection at Bellagio,'' which continues the Phillips's commitment to sharing its collection with broad audiences, is the first museum loan show at the gallery. Among the highlights are van Gogh's ''Entrance to the Public Gardens in Arles,'' El Greco's ''Repentant St. Peter,'' Cezanne's ''Self-Portrait'' (the first of the artist's paintings to enter an American museum collection) and Degas's ''Dancers at the Barre.''</p>

        <p>Going West  Van Gogh, El Greco, Picasso, Degas, Manet and Cezanne are going to spend a few months in Las Vegas. A hotel exhibition of 26 of their major paintings and sculptures from the Phillips Collection in Washington begins on Friday at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, a noncommercial exhibition space in the Bellagio, which opened in 1998. On view through March 4, ''Masterworks From the Phillips Collection at Bellagio,'' which continues the Phillips's commitment to sharing its collection with broad audiences, is the first museum loan show at the gallery. Among the highlights are van Gogh's ''Entrance to the Public Gardens in Arles,'' El Greco's ''Repentant St. Peter,'' Cezanne's ''Self-Portrait'' (the first of the artist's paintings to enter an American museum collection) and Degas's ''Dancers at the Barre.''</p>
        <p>Casting News  Roger Bart, who won a Tony Award for best featured actor in a musical as Snoopy in the 1999 revival of ''You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' will take over the 36 characters in ''Fully Committed,'' Becky Mode's hit at the Cherry Lane Theater, on Sept. 12. Mark Setlock, who originated the roles of Sam, the frazzled reservation clerk at an upscale New York restaurant, and all the people who besiege him with phone calls, is taking the entire original cast to Los Angeles for an opening in the fall.</p>
        <p>Passion  Portraits and landscape paintings, sculpture, painted and decorated furniture, schoolgirl art, quilts, coverlets and blankets. All these are among the 60 works to go on view from Saturday through Jan. 7 at the Museum of American Folk Art at 2 Lincoln Square. They reflect the refined taste of Cyril Irwin Nelson, a book editor, folk art collector and trustee of the museum who has been a frequent contributor to its collection. Most of the objects in ''An Engagement With Folk Art: Cyril I. Nelson's Gifts to the Museum of American Folk Art'' come from the Northeastern United States, where his scholarly interest in folk art was activated by a family-owned painting of a mother and daughter that is part of the exhibition.</p>
        <p>On the Road  American Ballet Theater is bound for China for its first performances there. The three-week tour, from Sept. 25 to Oct. 14, will include full-length versions of ''La Bayadere'' and ''Don Quixote'' and repertory pieces like ''Diversion of Angels,'' ''Meadow,'' ''Theme and Variations,'' ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux'' and the pas de deux from ''Le Corsaire'' and ''The Sleeping Beauty.'' The company is to give a total of seven performances at two theaters in Shanghai, five performances in Hong Kong and six in Taipei. It will return in time for its fall season at City Center.</p>
