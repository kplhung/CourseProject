        <p>Should you arrange a meeting to see just what Maggie Norris has been creating lately, she will politely ask you to be discreet.

        <p>Couture for Those Drawn by Horses</p>
        <p>Should you arrange a meeting to see just what Maggie Norris has been creating lately, she will politely ask you to be discreet. A photographer visiting Ms. Norris's studio, for example, might be advised to make a camera bag look less like a camera bag. That is because at the moment Ms. Norris's studio occupies a space in her toile-de-Jouy-filled Park Avenue apartment.</p>
        <p>''The neighbors aren't crazy about all this,'' Ms. Norris said the other day, ''this'' being the evening wear business she is getting under way. ''And selling is definitely a no-no.''</p>
        <p>With the possible exception of a few women in Middleburg, Va., Ms. Norris's Upper East Side neighbors are among the few in the world who might truly appreciate her product: haute couture evening ensembles with an equestrian theme. Clients will place orders for the clothes through Bergdorf Goodman, which will carry the samples.</p>
        <p>Ms. Norris, an unadorned beauty who answers her door in jodhpurs and riding boots, worked as the senior design director for Ralph Lauren's women's line. About a year and a half ago, she decided to start her own line of one-of-a-kind pieces, Maggie Norris Couture. The designs, made in Parisian ateliers, include full-length skirts embroidered at the legendary house of Lesage, corsets with leather fasteners and silk riding jackets. Ms. Norris also works with antique fabrics -- one corset is made from old French table linen -- but she isn't worried about their fragility. ''The haute couture customer wears something once, at the most twice,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A Fashion Angel Who Watches TV</p>
        <p>Apparently it isn't just the Wally Lambs of the world for whom exposure on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' can provide an unexpected career jolt. A few years ago, Barry Pfeifer, president of Cullen USA, a cashmere company, saw the designer Patrick Robinson on Oprah. Last September, after Mr. Robinson, who had struggled to find backing for his high-end line, shut it down, Mr. Pfeifer gave him a call.</p>
        <p>''What went wrong was that I needed the right partner,'' Mr. Robinson, who had worked for Giorgio Armani and as head designer at Anne Klein, said of his failed venture. ''Calvin Klein has Barry Schwartz. I always said I needed a Barry. Now I have my own Barry.''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Pfeifer as his manager, Mr. Robinson is introducing a line of knits, T-shirts and jeans for men and women in their teens and 20's. It will have its debut this week at Magic 2001 in Las Vegas, a street-wear exposition.</p>
        <p>The line will be called Patrick Clark -- Clark is Mr. Robinson's middle name -- so that Mr. Robinson can preserve his surname for any future forays into the world of clothing that sells at places like Barneys rather than places like Urban Outfitters.</p>
        <p>''I think this is going to expand into that,'' Mr. Robinson said of the possibility of once again designing $1,200 dresses. ''I have denim in this collection for $60, and leather for over $600.''</p>
        <p>Alaia's Museum Pieces</p>
        <p>It has been nearly 20 years since Azzedine Alaia first appeared in fashion's orbit with his spiral zippers and curved seams, and a vision of women that, as Joan Juliet Buck, the editor of French Vogue, once put it, resembled ''highly sexualized versions of Darth Vader.''</p>
        <p>Beginning Sept. 22 and running through Nov. 15, the Guggenheim Museum SoHo will honor the Tunisian-born Mr. Alaia with an exhibition of 50 of his pieces, including the bandage dress made for Grace Jones and the gold-beaded dress made for Tina Turner, as well as the dress he designed for Stephanie Seymour's wedding to Peter Brant.</p>
        <p>Ms. Seymour and Mr. Brant were the ones who had the idea of bringing the show to New York. A larger show of Mr. Alaia's work, with plexiglass mannequins modeled after Naomi Campbell's body, went up at the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands in 1997.</p>
        <p>That show, like this one, was assembled by Mark Wilson, the chief curator at the Groninger, who combined Mr. Alaia's pieces with sources of their inspiration. The Guggenheim show, for example, will feature a tableau of a few Alaia dresses displayed in front of Andy Warhol's ''Last Supper'' paintings.</p>
