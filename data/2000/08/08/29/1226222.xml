        <p>For the 23-campus California State University system, which prepares about 60 percent of California's teachers and 10 percent of the teachers in the country, quality is our highest priority. Our experience tells us -- and research confirms -- that it is impossible to prepare a teacher in just three weeks (front page, Aug. 24).</p>
        <p>Contrary to the examples cited in your article, state policy makers have given strong support to our more comprehensive teacher-preparation programs. They view our universities as key players in solving California's wide teacher shortage.</p>

        <p>Contrary to the examples cited in your article, state policy makers have given strong support to our more comprehensive teacher-preparation programs. They view our universities as key players in solving California's wide teacher shortage.</p>
        <p>Gov. Gray Davis has also entrusted California State University and the University of California to provide more than $100 million worth of in-service training. These programs allow us to help California's working teachers reach the high level of instructional quality that students deserve.</p>
