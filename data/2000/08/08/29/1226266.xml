        <p>GORDON-Ruth. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a highly respected member of the Jewish community, a dear friend who-with her husband, I. Lewis-was a YU Benefactor. Former professionals with the NYC Board of Education, they expressed their dedication to the advancement of Jewish education by establishing the Ruth and I. Lewis Gordon Chair in Jewish Studies at our Bernard Revel Graduate School. We extend our heartfelt condolences as well to children, Fred Gordon and Dr. Charles (and Susan) Gordon; grandchildren; and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Dr. Norman Lamm, President Yeshiva University David S. Gottesman, Chairman YU Board of Trustees Mordecai D. Katz, Chairman Board of Directors Bernard Revel Graduate School</p>
        <p>GORDON-Ruth. Our sincerest condolences to I. Lewis Gordon on the loss of his beloved wife. A woman of quiet grace, dignity and humility, she spent her life, together with her husband, dedicated to the values and ethics of traditional Judaism. As Diamond Founders the Gordons have played a vital role in providing ultra-modern medical care to the people of Israel. May Lewis, sons Fred and Charles, and the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer. Comm. for Shaare Zedek Jerusalem Med. Ctr. Erica Jesselson, Chair Menno Ratzker, Pres.</p>
