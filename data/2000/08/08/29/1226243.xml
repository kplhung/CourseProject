        <p>After clinching the Eastern Division title with the 6-4 victory last Saturday night in Dallas, the MetroStars are guaranteed no less than a third-place finish in Major League Soccer and the home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars announced yesterday that their first playoff game in the two-of-three-game series will be played Sept. 15 at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., against a team to be determined. It will be the first playoff appearance in three years for the MetroStars, who have a good chance to finish on top of the league this season after a last-place finish last season.</p>
        <p>With three games left, the MetroStars (16-10-3) have a 1-point edge over Kansas City (14-7-8), which the MetroStars played to a scoreless deadlock last Wednesday, for first place over all and for home-field advantage. M.L.S. Cup 2000 will be staged Oct. 15 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars, helped by a league-record five goals by Clint Mathis, clinched the division title in grand fashion last Saturday in Dallas. It is the first title of any kind for the MetroStars, and they celebrated their achievement with Champagne. The five goals by Mathis earned him player of the week honors for the second consecutive week.</p>
        <p>''It was like a highlight reel,'' Mathis said. ''Clinching the division was more important than my goals, but it was good for the fans to see that many goals.'' Mathis's 10 points on Saturday give him 46 for the season and pushed him into second in league scoring behind Tampa Bay's Mamadou Diallo.</p>
        <p>Mathis has 16 goals and 14 assists, while Diallo has 48 points from 23 goals and 2 assists. The MetroStars may concentrate their offense on Mathis to help him pass Diallo, the man who ended the season for their starting goalkeeper, Mike Ammann, in a collision two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>OLYMPICS</p>
        <p>The United States women's Olympic team will play its final match before the Summer Games Friday night in San Jose, Calif., against Brazil. The women will then convene in a secret location for a weekend retreat before departing for Australia on Monday.</p>
        <p>Defender Michelle French was selected yesterday by Coach April Heinrichs to take the place of Michelle Akers. The 22-year-old French was selected four days after the 34-year-old Akers retired from international soccer after another shoulder injury that requires surgery for the second time.</p>
        <p>French had been the captain of the under-21 team for the past four years. She has appeared nine times with the national team and can play various positions on defense and in midfield. French's selection moved Aly Wagner to the top of the alternate list.</p>
        <p>Akers has generally been considered the greatest female soccer player in the world. Her experience, tenacity and skill in midfield will be missed by the Americans as they defend their gold medal in Australia.</p>
        <p>2002 WORLD CUP</p>
        <p>The United States men will start training today for Sunday's qualifying game against Guatemala in R.F.K. Stadium. Coach Bruce Arena has invited 20 players, including goalkeeper Kasey Keller, who missed the 7-0 triumph over Barbados on Aug. 16, for the game against Guatemala, which is expected to draw more than 50,000 fans.</p>
        <p>Claudio Reyna of Glasgow Rangers and EArnie Stewart of NAC Breda in the Netherlands, who will be in midfield for the Americans against Guatemala, scored goals for their European teams over the weekend. Joe-Max Moore, who will be the central striker against Guatemala, also had an assist in his first start of the season for Everton in the English Premier League.</p>
        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>In France, striker Nicolas Anelka scored his first two goals for Paris Saint-Germain in a 3-1 victory over Bastia on Sunday and said he relished the unique pleasure of the scorer. Anelka made headlines more for his sullenness and various problems in England (Arsenal) and Spain (Real Madrid) the past two years before returning to his first club this season. Anelka returned to PSG from Real Madrid for $31.8 million.</p>
        <p>In England, the French midfielder Patrick Vieira scored twice in Arsenal's 5-3 victory over Charlton Athletic to put Arsenal into a four-way tie at the top of the Premier League, along with Leeds, Newcastle and Coventry. The defending champion, Manchester United, gave away a two-goal lead in a 2-2 deadlock with West Ham United. Liverpool was just as frustrated as Manchester United was, conceding three goals in the last 18 minutes for a 3-3 tie with Southampton.</p>
        <p>SOUTH AMERICA</p>
        <p>In Argentina, River Plate was helped by a brilliant performance from Ariel Ortega on his return to Argentine soccer in a 4-1 triumph over Rosario Central in the Apertura championship. River Plate is second in the standing on goals difference behind its archrivals, Boca Juniors, a 3-1 victor over Newell's Old Boys.</p>
        <p>In Brazil, ejections were the norm in the Joao Havelange Cup, which has replaced the Brazilian championship this year following a legal dispute. Nine players were ejected in three games. Four players were ejected in Ponte Prenta's 3-2 victory over Atletico Mineiro, and one each in Gremio's 2-1 triumph over Corinthians. Palmeiras edged Santos by 3-2 despite finishing the game with nine players.</p>
        <p>In Colombia, the veteran goalkeeper Rene Higuita missed a penalty in Real Cartegena's scoreless deadlock at Millionarios. Higuita fired wide in the 37th minute but made some important saves at the other end to secure a point for his team.</p>
