        <p>As children return to school these days, producers and purveyors of school uniforms are enjoying an arithmetic lesson of their own: the rising number of cities, including New York, that require or encourage public school students to wear uniforms is adding up to more profit.</p>
        <p>As uniform policies have spread from parochial and other private schools to public schools in the last half-dozen years, the school uniform business has expanded.</p>
        <p>Once the domain of manufacturers and sellers that made traditional uniforms -- like tartan plaid skirts or jumpers with matching accessories and, often, the school's crest -- the business has diversified. It now includes companies that offer a full line of children's clothing and have established school uniform labels to meet the often less formal requirements of the public school dress codes.</p>
        <p>With about three-quarters of New York City's public elementary school children wearing uniforms under a policy going into its second year -- more than 400,000 of 550,000 children  -- the city has been a center of growth in the uniform business.</p>
        <p>''It's about 30 percent of our revenues,'' said Jack Falack, president of Cookie's Department Stores.</p>
        <p>Cookie's has five stores in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens, and before the Board of Education put a systemwide dress policy into effect last September, uniform sales represented 10 to 15 percent of its sales.</p>
        <p>''You have hundreds of thousands of kids in uniform now, so it's a big push,'' Mr. Falack said.</p>
        <p>Before the new policy, he said, ''some public schools were doing it voluntarily, and there were the private schools.'' From 150,000 to 200,000 parochial and other private school students in the city are believed to wear uniforms.</p>
        <p>French Toast, a Manhattan-based children's clothing maker and a major supplier of school uniforms nationwide, says that public school uniform programs like New York's have led to 10 percent increases in the company's school uniform business each year over the last five years.</p>
        <p>The NPD Group, a market research company in Port Washington, N.Y., estimated that in 1998, before New York's policy went into effect, parents nationwide spent $900 million on uniforms for elementary schoolchildren, or about 7 percent of the total spent on children's clothes.</p>
        <p>But some experts say that the extent of the business is hard to measure, given the ever-loosening concept of what a school uniform is.</p>
        <p>In New York City, for example, where public schools can opt out of the program -- and parents can also have their children exempted -- required clothing can range from a ''formal and traditional uniform'' to what the regulations describe as ''a uniform color and style scheme; for example, white button-down shirts or turtleneck shirts and black or navy pants or skirts, bought anywhere.''</p>
        <p>The fact that a uniform in many places can be just khaki pants and a button-down Oxford-style shirt makes it difficult to produce accurate figures for the school uniform business, said Bernard Lepper, executive director of the National Association of Uniform Manufacturers and Distributors. For some clothes manufacturers, getting into the uniform business has not been such a big leap.</p>
        <p>''Some of it is just repackaging,'' said Nick Monjo, editor in chief of School Uniforms Magazine, a trade publication, noting that ''some clothing companies have been taking what they have been making all along and have started calling it school uniforms.''</p>
        <p>And where buying a uniform in the past often meant going to a speciality store or distributor under contract with schools to outfit their students, buying one today increasingly means heading for a Kmart, Wal-Mart or J.C. Penney, or places like Cookie's. There, parents can scoop up some shirts and chino pants or blouses and skirts that meet a school's requirements.</p>
        <p>''The trend has been to be more flexible in the styles allowed within the color scheme,'' said Michael Sutton, general manager of Lollytogs, the parent company of French Toast.</p>
        <p>The first major public school district to adopt a uniform policy was Long Beach, Calif., in 1994. Among others that have since adopted policies, according to the federal Department of Education, are districts in Miami, Los Angeles, Baltimore and San Antonio. Philadelphia also recently adopted a uniform policy.</p>
        <p>The policies vary. Some districts permit schools -- but not individual students -- to be exempt. Others allow exempting students with their parents' permission, but not entire schools.</p>
        <p>A 1997 Education Department study found that 3 percent of the nation's public schools required their students to wear uniforms, mostly in elementary and middle schools.</p>
        <p>But this year, 10 percent of 750 principals reported that their schools had adopted uniform policies in a survey commissioned by the National Association of Elementary School Principals and the mail-order retailer Land's End. An additional 11 percent said their schools were considering the idea. Most of of the principals were in elementary schools.</p>
        <p>Proponents of dress codes believe they foster discipline and school pride, help students resist peer pressure to wear designer clothing, decrease thefts of expensive clothes and prevent students from wearing gang colors.</p>
        <p>Moreover, according to the NPD Group's study, ''uniforms are less expensive than nonuniform school clothes. The organization found that in 1998, families buying school uniforms across the country spent an average of $104, while those buying clothing for children in schools without uniform codes averaged $185.</p>
        <p>A recent survey by the New York City Consumer Affairs Department found that the cost of a school uniform wardrobe in the city ranged from $38 to $223 for boys and $29 to $217 for girls.</p>
