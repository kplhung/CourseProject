        <p>MANHATTAN: TOURIST ROBBED AT KNIFEPOINT -- An Italian tourist was robbed at knifepoint early yesterday morning near Grand Central Terminal, by two young women who offered him a ride in their car, the police said. As soon as the man got into the car, at 46th Street and Lexington Avenue, the women locked the doors, threatened him with a knife and demanded money, the police said. In the ensuing struggle, the women took the man's wallet and cut him. The 33-year-old tourist, whose name was not released, went to St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center with minor injuries.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: HIRSCHFELD PLEADS, SOFTLY -- Rather than screaming in court, paying jurors or spinning bizarre accusations against lawyers, Abe Hirschfeld did something unusual yesterday: he remained almost quiet. The 81-year-old real estate developer pleaded guilty to tax evasion in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and paid a $1 million fine to put the 123-count case behind him. But some of his old spirit showed through when he denounced the state's lawyer as crooked and the case against him as false.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: DORM INSPECTIONS URGED -- All college dormitories in New York State should undergo fire inspections at least once a year, a panel appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki recommended yesterday. The panel said the state should rescind the exemptions to fire inspections now given to colleges in New York City, Buffalo, Yonkers, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany. The task force also recommended that sprinklers be installed in any new or repaired dormitories. The panel was appointed after three students died in a dormitory fire at Seton Hall University in New Jersey.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: TROUBLED SCHOOL TO REOPEN -- The trustees of the State University of New York has approved the amended charter of New Covenant Charter School, which has been plagued by academic, disciplinary and managerial problems. The school can now open after Labor Day under a new management company. The charter school was also immediately put on probation and required to adhere to a remedial action plan to be set by SUNY's Charter School Institute. The school's management will switch from Advantage Schools of Boston to Edison Schools in Manhattan.</p>

        <p>THE BRONX: SCHOOL DAMAGED -- A Roman Catholic elementary school in the Bronx was damaged extensively yesterday in a fire caused by workers drilling into live wires, the Fire Department said. The four-alarm blaze burned holes in the roof of the school, the Villa Maria Academy in the Country Club section, said Firefighter Joseph Leoncavallo, a department spokesman. Workers were installing a computer network at the school around 1:15 p.m. when they drilled into live wires of the air-conditioning system, causing an electrical fire, Firefighter Leoncavallo said. Eight firefighters were treated for minor injuries, he said.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE URGED -- The state's labor commissioner is reviewing a request to increase the state's minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to at least $7.65 an hour. Labor Commissioner James McGowan is bound by law to consider the increase, which he has the power to make without consulting the State Legislature, if he is petitioned to do so by low-income state residents. The Hunger Action Network collected petitions with the signatures of 434 such residents.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: SUPPORT FOR DALAI LAMA -- Swamis, rabbis, monks and ministers gathered yesterday at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel for the United Nations' Millennium World Peace Summit. But the four-day meeting has already provoked controversy because organizers did not invite the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist leader, for fear of offending China, which occupies Tibet. Two representatives of the Dalai Lama will speak later in the week. About 150 demonstrators protested across the street from the United Nations.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: LAND PRESERVATION LAW -- Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed the first of five bills yesterday intended to pump $61 million into land preservation for parks and wildlife refuges. She signed an open space bill to provide $6.6 million to 15 nonprofit groups that have submitted proposals to buy land. In the past, the groups had to acquire land on their own and seek state or federal money later.</p>

        <p>SOMERVILLE: MURDER INDICTMENT -- A Somerville man has been charged with murder in the shooting of a Plainfield man early Sunday, the Somerset County prosecutor said yesterday. The two men argued during a memorial service for a third man killed in a car accident. The man who was charged, Sherwin Field, 20, was being held on $500,000 bail, said the prosecutor, Wayne J. Forrest. Jaime D. Suitt, 20, of Plainfield, was killed just after midnight Sunday when a hollow-point bullet severed an artery in his hip. Kenneth Harmon, 20, and Wayne DeBarros, 22, both of Plainfield, were wounded in the same attack.</p>

        <p>MONTVILLE: TRIBAL ELECTIONS HELD -- Mark Brown, a former police officer, was the top vote winner in the election of the Mohegan Tribal Council on Sunday. The nine-member council is the governing body of the tribe, which owns and operates the Mohegan Sun Casino. Roland J. Harris, the council's current chairman, finished second in the elections. Three new members were elected: Peter Schultz, 46, the tribe's director of human relations; Christine Damon-Murtha, 52, a reporter and photographer for the tribe's publications; and Donald Chapman, 74, a retired Coast Guard commander. One of the biggest election issues was how to divide casino profits among the tribe's nearly 1,400 members. Members have been receiving $10,000 a year, which some feel is too little.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: RECORD STUDENT ENROLLMENT -- This year's expected enrollment of 559,000 students in Connecticut public schools is up by 4,000 from last year and represents the 12th consecutive year of growth, said Tom Murphy, spokesman for the State Education Department. Statewide, districts have spent about $2.8 billion on construction projects in the last five years to create more space and renovate old buildings.</p>
