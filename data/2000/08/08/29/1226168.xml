        <p>Dodging falling globs of molten cable, firemen finally put out a searing blaze today that turned the television tower that is Europe's tallest structure, Russia's pride and Moscow's communications hub into a 1,772-foot kitchen match.</p>
        <p>As the television screens of an estimated 20 million Russians flickered, firefighters battled for nearly 26 hours before smothering the fire in the Ostankino tower. As they fought, they were forced to retreat steadily as flames licked downward through makeshift asbestos barriers and across firebreaks where flammable wiring had been torn away.</p>
        <p>Late today, officials announced that the bodies of a firefighter and an  elevator operator had been found in one elevator that had fallen nearly 1,000 feet into a basement sometime during the fire. A third body was believed to be pinned in the debris.</p>
        <p>Like the sinking of the submarine Kursk, the disaster delivered another blow to the nation's diminishing standing as a technological power of the first rank.</p>
        <p>Before the firefighters declared victory about 6 p.m. today, the fire had engulfed all of the pre-stressed concrete section of the tower above the 225-foot level, as well as much of a 410-foot metal antenna at the top.</p>
        <p>The concrete part appeared in no danger of collapse, engineers said. But they refused to say the same of the heat-seared antenna, which is spiked with so many metal bristles that it resembles a gigantic hairbrush.</p>
        <p>The fire apparently began about 3:20 p.m. Sunday on that antenna, in a mass of wiring at about 1,500 feet, and burned its way earthward for most of the next day.</p>
        <p>The battle against it was fatally hamstrung by the fact that the only safe way to fight the blaze -- as firefighters belatedly discovered -- was to carry extinguishers by hand up more than 1,000 feet of stairs.</p>
        <p>The victims of the fire apparently were trapped sometime Sunday after power to an elevator failed as they were ferrying fire-fighting supplies upward. Officials said they had probably died of suffocation or heat even before the fire melted cables and caused the elevator to plunge into the basement, more than 21 feet below ground.</p>
        <p>Seven other firefighters were rescued from an elevator that plunged several hundred feet Sunday evening, only to be stopped by emergency brakes 950 feet above ground.</p>
        <p>As with the explosion and sinking of the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk two weeks ago, rescuers were shown to lack the equipment and know-how to deal with the emergency, even when the fire reached the level of an ordinary high-rise.</p>
        <p>And like the Kursk, the Ostankino tower was long regarded as a triumph of Russian know-how -- which is to say Soviet know-how, in the days when the Kremlin was bent on impressing friends and enemies with its ability to think in gargantuan terms.</p>
        <p>The Ostankino tower was the world's tallest free-standing structure when it was built in 1967 to mark the 50th anniversary of the Soviet revolution. One writer then compared it to a giant syringe for ideological injections.</p>
        <p>In 1993, when Communist plotters tried to seize Ostankino in a failed coup against President Boris N. Yeltsin, it came to symbolize the importance of a free press to a democracy.</p>
        <p>Today, President Vladimir V. Putin suggested that it was a metaphor for Russia's current status as a pitiful, helpless giant.</p>
        <p>''This latest accident shows the shape of our vital installations and the overall state of our country,'' he said. ''We should not forget the large-scale problems or current economic issues here.''</p>
        <p>Vadim Romanchik, a 36-year-old banker who lives with his wife and daughter in the tower's reedy shadow, said he took the fire to heart. ''My wife was born here in 1965, and I moved here in '72,'' he said today. ''This tower can be viewed as one of the symbols of Moscow. I'm proud to say I live here, and if it ceases to exist, it will be a great loss.</p>
        <p>''I don't want it to fall down. But they can't leave it like this.''</p>
        <p>While the fire briefly knocked out television across the entire country, its effects were mostly confined to Moscow, where an overwhelming majority of viewers rely on over-the-air broadcasts instead of more expensive cable programming.</p>
        <p>No one today seemed sure of the 51,400-ton tower's fate.</p>
        <p>The tower's designer, Nikolai Nikitin, shared a birthday with Gustave Eiffel of France, whose tower was a bit over half as tall. Mr. Nikitin often said his work would withstand the elements for at least 300 years. But he apparently was thinking of wind and rain, not fire.</p>
        <p>While the concrete rings that constitute the tower's frame seemed structurally intact today, 80 of its 149 high-tension steel cables had melted or warped in the heat. The cables hold the tower upright much as some children's toys can be jerked upright by pulling tight an elastic cord, and they make it both taut and flexible in the wind.</p>
        <p>Engineers said the structure was built to withstand the damage it endured, but government officials also said it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to repair it -- money this nation can ill afford.</p>
        <p>Eduard Sagalayev, the president of Russia's National Association of Television and Radio Broadcasters, slipped into a eulogy today when talking about the fire, telling Echo Moskvy radio that the tower ''was a unique structure.''</p>
        <p>''Let us not speak in the past tense,'' an interviewer said. ''It gives you a funny feeling.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sagalayev replied: ''Unfortunately, one has to speak in the past tense. If it does not collapse, I doubt that it will be able to perform its functions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin, who was criticized for a lackadaisical response to the Kursk disaster, wasted no time today, ordering engineers to restore television and other communications to Moscow within a week. By day's end, brainstormers were proposing to mount transmitters everywhere from beneath helium balloons to atop the roofs of Moscow's hilltop state university.</p>
        <p>The fire could have been much worse. It surprised the city on a brilliant Sunday afternoon, when throngs of sightseers had come to the Ostankino tower for the elevator ride to its 1,105-foot-high observation platform and a meal in the structure's Seventh Heaven restaurant.</p>
        <p>The fire began above them, in a section of the antenna used by a paging service, and tourists and workers were safely evacuated before it spread.</p>
        <p>As the fire sputtered out this afternoon, hundreds of onlookers and nearly as many journalists gathered several hundred yards from the tower -- as close as the police would allow -- to take pictures, gawk and speculate about whether the spire looked as if it was leaning. (It was not; workers for the city's geological agency monitored the tilt, and said it was within normal limits.)</p>
        <p>Most people here seemed to suffer the loss of entertainment good-naturedly.</p>
        <p>''I watch MTV practically all the time,'' 12-year-old Ivan Lionov said as he stood along a cordoned-off street in north Moscow that provided a good view of the tower. ''But we'll live. Of course it's bad. But soon we'll be in school.''</p>
        <p>And an elderly woman selling sunflower seeds and pistachios to the throngs of gawkers on the street had a contrarian view some Westerners might appreciate.</p>
        <p>''You can bury my TV,'' she said. ''There's nothing to watch -- just bad things and naked people.''</p>
