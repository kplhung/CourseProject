        <p>''Do the Evolution'' is a catchy stomper that Pearl Jam tossed into its set on Friday, finishing a three-night stand at Jones Beach. It's also a good description of how Pearl Jam has survived in the age of hype.</p>
        <p>This Seattle band's classic-rock-meets-punk sound has been eclipsed by hip-hop, and at 35, its magnetic singer, Eddie Vedder, is no longer a new messiah. But instead of trying to stay hip, Mr. Vedder and the band have matured into artistic and moral perfectionists: the Ralph Naders of rock.</p>

        <p>''Do the Evolution'' is a catchy stomper that Pearl Jam tossed into its set on Friday, finishing a three-night stand at Jones Beach. It's also a good description of how Pearl Jam has survived in the age of hype.</p>
        <p>This Seattle band's classic-rock-meets-punk sound has been eclipsed by hip-hop, and at 35, its magnetic singer, Eddie Vedder, is no longer a new messiah. But instead of trying to stay hip, Mr. Vedder and the band have matured into artistic and moral perfectionists: the Ralph Naders of rock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader surfaced on Friday in a preconcert video featuring the band Rage Against the Machine. Pearl Jam had also set up voter-registration tables near the entrance. The band's progressive persona complements its music, which has become more self-contained and experimental. Like good consumer advocates, its members promote high-quality, uncompromised rock.</p>
        <p>Recently, though, Pearl Jam faced a serious test. Nine fans were crushed to death during the band's set at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark in June. For a group that prides itself on a healthy relationship with its fans, this must have been cataclysmic.</p>
        <p>But Pearl Jam has carried on for its fans, and on Friday the band let its fans be its healers. The show began at a high pitch, with the meditative ''Sometimes'' leading into a tense bunch of rockers that had Mr. Vedder jerking around as if possessed.</p>
        <p>Playing guitar more than ever, Mr. Vedder goaded the band on in skittish arrangements recalling the early Who, his favorite band and an apt model. The Who also endured a festival-seating disaster in 1979 in Cincinnati, and its leader, Pete Townshend, has recently been Mr. Vedder's confidant.</p>
        <p>Watching Mr. Vedder do Mr. Townshend's signature windmill move was a blast. Soon, however, Pearl Jam turned to the recent example of its other elder counsel, Neil Young, and rested with a string of ballads. The fans loved it, singing every one.  But despite Mike McCready's valiant guitar solos, the band lost steam.</p>
        <p>Now and then the energy spiked. The guitarist Stone Gossard lifted the mood as he sang ''Mankind.'' Matt Cameron used muscle on the drums to intensify ''Given to Fly.'' And the introverted Mr. Vedder let loose on the vampy ''Smile'' and a clamorous version of the Who's ''Baba O'Riley.''</p>
        <p>But the night's theme was recovery, as the band absorbed the inspiration it usually provides. The fans instantly complied with Mr. Vedder's request to sing along to ''Jeremy,'' and in such moments, Pearl Jam must have realized the value of its caring, slow-growth strategy.</p>
        <p>Sonic Youth opened the show with songs from its outstanding new album, ''New York City Ghosts and Flowers'' (Interscope). With Jim O'Rourke adding extra guitar and occasional bass, this New York band offered a fine slice of its wide-ranging art rock. It's a shame that only a few hundred Pearl Jam fans saw Sonic Youth, because few bands have done the evolution so well.</p>
