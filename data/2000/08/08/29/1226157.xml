        <p>The Anti-Defamation League called yesterday for Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, to stop making ''overt expressions'' of religious belief on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>Such appeals in a political context, the league said, risk alienating people and also run ''contrary to the American ideal.''</p>
        <p>The league's request to Mr. Lieberman came in a letter signed by Abraham H. Foxman, its national director, and Howard P. Berkowitz, its national chairman. They said that although the organization believed that candidates ''should feel comfortable explaining their religious convictions to voters,'' there was ''a point at which an emphasis on religion in a political campaign becomes inappropriate and even unsettling in a religiously diverse society such as ours.''</p>
        <p>In an interview last night, Mr. Foxman said the letter was in response to remarks Mr. Lieberman made at a Detroit church during its Sunday services, calling for a greater role for religion in American life.</p>
        <p>''We do not think that religion belongs in the political campaign and the political arena,'' Mr. Foxman said. ''There's nothing wrong with somebody professing their faith and going to church or synagoue, but this is almost hawking it.''</p>
        <p>In the speech in Detroit, Mr. Lieberman, the first Jew to run on the presidential ticket of a major party, said that he hoped his nomination encouraged people ''to feel more free to talk about their faith'' and that it also reinforced the idea that ''there must be a place for faith in America's public life.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''As a people, we need to reaffirm our faith and renew the dedication of our nation and ourselves to God and God's purpose.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman returned to the theme of religion in public life yesterday, when he spoke to religious leaders in Chicago. He called the United States ''the most religious country in the world'' and said that not only were Americans citizens of the same country, but that ''we are also children of the same awesome God.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman was not alone yesterday in invoking a public role for religious belief. In a speech to a B'nai B'rith convention in Washington, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee for president, spoke of his support for Israel and also praised the work conducted by faith-based social programs.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Bush said, ''Our nation is chosen by God and commissioned by history to be a model to the world of justice and inclusion and diversity without division. Jews and Christians and Muslims speak as one in their commitment to a kind, just, tolerant society.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Foxman said he had not been aware of Mr. Lieberman's  or Mr. Bush's comments yesterday. He said the league, a division of B'nai B'rith, had not received a reply from Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>Candidates in the presidential campaign have expressed their religious faith in public terms on previous occasions. During a debate among the Republican presidential candidates in December, Mr. Bush identified Jesus as his favorite philosopher. The same month, Vice President Al Gore, now the Democratic presidential nominee, told an interviewer for ''60 Minutes'' that he considered himself a born-again Christian.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foxman said that the league had written the candidates last year to ask them not to invoke religion in their political appeals.</p>
        <p>''We drew a line during the primaries for Bush and Gore,'' he said. ''And we now think Senator Lieberman crossed it.''</p>
