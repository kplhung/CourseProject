        <p>Quietly, the Jets' offense has coalesced behind an offensive line that could be even better than the unit that blocked for the 12-4 team of 1998.</p>
        <p>And the line will not be disrupted by -- heaven forbid -- having Kevin Mawae, the brawny Pro Bowl center, snap the ball for punts and field goals this year. That arcane assignment, one that Mawae wanted no part of, was filled today in a pigskin comedy that included the rehiring of John Hudson, the dismissal of John Hudson, and the hiring of Brad Banta.</p>
        <p>As Coach Al Groh began the drills today that will lead to the season's opener Sunday at Green Bay, he took time to praise his offensive line. It was the spearhead of an offensive attack that produced more yardage than any other National Football League team during the exhibition season. In particular, the line pushed people out of the way for Curtis Martin, who led all preseason runners.</p>
        <p>''I thought going in, this unit would be one of the strong points of the team,'' Groh said. ''Only one player is established as strong at his position, and that's Kevin Mawae. The others are all emerging. But they all have a personality -- tough-minded.''</p>
        <p>The 1999 season saw three inexperienced players take hold on the line -- Kerry Jenkins at left guard, Ryan Young at right tackle and Randy Thomas at right guard.</p>
        <p>The only veterans were Mawae, in the middle, and Jumbo Elliott, who came off the bench to replace an injured Jason Fabini at left tackle.</p>
        <p>Now look at them: Fabini anchors the left side, next to Jenkins, with Mawae centering, alongside Young, who is next to Thomas.</p>
        <p>''If there's one position on the team much improved from a year ago, it's the offensive line,'' quarterback Vinny Testaverde said. ''They're the true anchor of our team right now.''</p>
        <p>But please do not ask the middle of that line -- Mawae -- to do any long snapping. Mawae feels his position at center is so demanding that he has no time to think of anything else, including the crucial duties of a long snapper.</p>
        <p>''I've never liked doing it,'' Mawae said, before learning that the Jets had gone through a tumultuous morning in finding a new long snapper. ''Mentally, it takes away a lot -- running down after those speed demons. Maybe one day when I'm in my 12th year and I can't play anymore, maybe I'll do it. I'm really good at playing center. I want to stay really good at it.''</p>
        <p>Mawae had feared he might open the season as the long snapper on field goals and punts. Dennis O'Sullivan, the leading choice in camp, was cut over the weekend. Then Hudson, who had snapped for four seasons for the Jets and never sailed a bad one in 600 snaps, was re-signed this morning. Hudson was to earn the veteran's minimum of $440,000, and was well worth it, according to the Jets' revised thinking.</p>
        <p>Yet, other than long snaps, Hudson had not played a down in the N.F.L. since 1992. Groh wanted someone who could snap and play on special teams, or block in goal-line situations.</p>
        <p>That was the Jets' reasoning in originally replacing Hudson with O'Sullivan, a second player who had the potential to also be a backup on the offensive line. But when O'Sullivan had trouble with the long snaps in preseason games, the team reached out to Hudson. And then, according to Hudson's agent, Jim Steiner, the Jets, in a matter of hours, quickly turned around and dropped Hudson again after learning that the Indianapolis Colts had cut Banta, a long snapper and backup tight end.</p>
        <p>Since Hudson signed a contract as a Jet -- if only for one day -- the team must pay him one-seventeenth of his salary, as if he had played in a game. Thus, he will earn about $26,000 for his quick visit to New York. Meanwhile, Banta's hiring will be announced Tuesday by the Jets.</p>
        <p>And imagine the confusion in the Jets' locker room this morning when Banta showed up and a sweating Hudson appeared after working out.</p>
        <p>A happy Mawae shook Hudson's hand and said, ''How was your vacation?''</p>
        <p>''Best camp I ever had,'' said Hudson, who had been snapping over the summer at his Tennessee farm and escaped the Jets' two-a-day workouts.</p>
        <p>Hudson went on to say he would play in Game 1 for the Jets even if he knew in advance that he had be gone afterward. ''Of course, wouldn't you?'' he said. ''If I came back for one game I'm guaranteed my salary for the whole year.''</p>
        <p>But later he found out he would not be around for Game 1. Meanwhile, the Jets did not have to cut anybody from the 53-man roster to make room for Banta -- at least not this week. Elliott is serving a one-game suspension for his part in a barroom brawl last year. Next week, someone will have to be cut to make room for the new snapper. Who knows? It could be Banta.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Coach AL GROH is waiting until Wednesday before telling his players whether SCOTT FROST or KEVIN WILLIAMS will start at free safety, and whether the rookie SHAUN ELLIS is his new left end.</p>
