        <p>A Long Island man found a new way to make real estate deals with no money down, prosecutors in Brooklyn said yesterday. He stole the properties with the stroke of a pen, they said, transferring the deeds into his own name by forging the rightful owners' signatures.</p>
        <p>He then used the phony deeds to secure more than $900,000 in mortgage loans and to sell some of the properties to unwitting buyers for a total of more than $700,000, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>From 1996 to 1998, prosecutors said the man, Kevin Walker, 35, of Sayville, N.Y., was able to steal 11 small houses or apartment buildings in the Bedford-Stuyvesant and Flatbush sections of Brooklyn. His victims included not only the private lending companies that gave him the mortgages and the title insurance companies that guaranteed the real estate deals, the authorities said, but also the owners who had their properties sold out from under them -- and the people who eventually bought them.</p>
        <p>Nachum Greenspan, for example, was surprised to find one day two years ago that his dead mother's home in East Flatbush had changed hands. ''We're very concerned  because the house has been sold -- there are other people living in it now,'' Mr. Greenspan said yesterday. ''A guy walks up to you and mugs you on the street. Well, this is a bit more sophisticated. But really, it's the same kind of thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker is accused of 23 counts of grand larceny in a criminal complaint filed yesterday in connection with the deals. He is being held in $100,000 bail and would face 5 to 15 years in prison on each count if convicted, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>''While most of us believe that it is not possible to get something for nothing, Mr. Walker is accused of doing just that,'' Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, said yesterday at a news conference. ''With nothing more than a few pieces of paper -- forged deeds -- he, in fact, turned nothing into $1.6 million.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hynes called the scheme ''a simple but extremely effective real estate scam.'' He said that Mr. Walker wrote down the addresses of vacant houses or small apartment buildings, then went to the Office of the  City Register, where he obtained microfilm copies of the pertinent deeds simply by providing the block and lot numbers. The deeds contained the names of the rightful owners, the prosecutor said, and Mr. Walker would then execute a new deed, signing as the buyer and forging the owners' signatures as the sellers.</p>
        <p>The scheme worked, Mr. Hynes explained, because in New York State, signatures alone are sufficient to transfer a deed from one party to another. In these cases, five of the legitimate owners of the buildings were dead, he said, and the owners of the six remaining properties had no idea their deeds had been switched to Mr. Walker's name. Investigators were still uncertain how he managed to advertise and sell homes and apartment buildings that he did not legally own. The investigators said they did not know what Mr. Walker had done with the $1.6 million that they said he had made from the deals.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Hynes, the title companies that guaranteed the sales of the properties are legally bound to reimburse any buyer who purchased a building from Mr. Walker. Without a change in the law, the district attorney said, there was really no way to prevent such a scheme from occurring again, aside from cracking down on people who did it and got caught. Other states go to greater lengths to check identification in real estate transfers, he said.</p>
        <p>The experience of Mr. Greenspan, a computer programmer from East Flatbush, was typical. He discovered what had happened to his mother's home on East 91st Street a couple of years ago, he said, after the brick two-story house was gutted by fire in 1996.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan checked on the home only occasionally as the renovations were slowly being done. On a visit about two years ago, he said, he was shocked to see the windows bricked up and a padlock on the door.  Confused, he executed a title search on the property and came up with  Kevin Walker -- a name he said he did not know. Then he called the authorities. While the district attorney's office was investigating his claim, he said, the house was sold to new owners.</p>
        <p>There was no one at the house last night, but neighbors said that the  current owners had bought the place within the year and had diligently worked to clean it up.</p>
        <p>''You're talking about people who came and fixed this house, who helped fix the entire block,'' said Murphy Moise, 29, who has lived on the block for nearly his entire life. ''It's the American dream. They worked hard to get this house, and now its like they have to start all over again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan said his lawyer has been in touch with the current occupants, but he refused to discuss their dealings because he has taken legal action to have the house returned.</p>
        <p>As of yesterday, Mr. Hynes said, none of the original deedholders had gotten their properties back. Although he added that it would take some time before the buildings were officially returned -- particularly since in some cases new people had already moved in -- he promised that his office would do its best to ensure that each of the properties went back to its rightful owner.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Walker himself, prosecutors said they knew little about him. Investigators said he had no prior arrests and added that they were still unsure if he had any training in the real estate trade. He sometimes operated under the name of a business called Communicare, said Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for the district attorney, but the business had no office or staff, only a telephone number listed in Long Island.</p>
        <p>''He appeared from the mists,'' Mr. Hynes said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker's next-door neighbor and landlord in Suffolk County, Bea Koch, said he was a polite and respectful man who had said that he worked as a counselor for troubled youths in Bohemia, N.Y., and apparently had no experience in the real-estate business. But Ms. Koch said in a telephone interview that she was not surprised that Mr. Walker had run into trouble with the law, or that it involved real estate.</p>
        <p>She said Mr. Walker always offered excuses when it came time to pay the rent. ''First his mother died, then his father died,'' she said. ''When he first started renting from us, he was bald. He said he had cancer. But then he started growing hair.''</p>
