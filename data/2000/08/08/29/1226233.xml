        <p>Over the past year, the shots uncoiled by the sculptured Venus and Serena Williams have come at Martina Hingis with the force of uppercuts. But instead of reacting to the sisters' power by putting up a scaffold around her fit but slight physique, Hingis will remain as is.</p>
        <p>She is not reaching for creatine to turn her body into bulk mail or searching out supplements for a potent answer. To combat the Williams sisters, Hingis, the No. 1 player in the world, will stick to improving upon the blueprint of her own instinctive style.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, after the first day of the United State Open was christened with a cloudburst at noon, Hingis revealed an appetizer of the skills she believes are getting sharper with age. By leaning on her almost clairvoyant anticipation, deceptive speed and crisp angles that form the backbone of her game, she dissected Alina Jidkova in 57 minutes.</p>
        <p>But once she exited Arthur Ashe Stadium, there were the Williams sisters again. Not in person, but in the form of questions. Oddly enough, however, perhaps as a defense mechanism, Hingis's most telling response to the sisters was delivered when the subject of her difficult 1999 season was raised.</p>
        <p>''Everybody expects me to do as I did in '97, which, in a way, I feel is unfair,'' said the 19-year-old Hingis, who won three majors in 1997 but has won just two since then. ''I have five Grand Slams. Venus and Serena each have one. Lindsay Davenport maybe now has three because she played better. But she's 24. The Williamses, you know, they're my age. I think, so far, I've been better than them.</p>
        <p>''I haven't been as injured as them. It's just the consistency; that's what counts to be No. 1, not who wins the most tournaments or who hits the ball the fastest or who hits the fastest serve.''</p>
        <p>Almost feisty in her demeanor, this was a more defiant Hingis than the one who slumped from Wimbledon with shattered spirits after Venus Williams crushed her confidence in the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>But like many of the other seeded players yesterday, Hingis used the first round of the United States Open as a new beginning. Third-seeded Venus Williams, on the other hand, continued the momentum she began to gain in July. Pounding the hardcourts with almost vicious ground strokes last night, she won her 20th straight match, leaving Anne-Gaelle Sidot behind, 6-3, 6-4.</p>
        <p>''I don't feel any pressure at all,'' said Williams, whose little sister, Serena, rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. ''Stock's up, high tide. I'm trying to keep it that way.''</p>
        <p>The rest of the seeded players held their value, as well. There were some minor tremors in their midst, but no upsets as 15th-seeded Jennifer Capriati, sixth-seeded Monica Seles, top-seeded Andre Agassi and fifth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov advanced to the second round.</p>
        <p>Fourth-seeded Pete Sampras also came through with a 7-6 (3), 7-5, 6-4 victory over Martin Damm. Tossing in 22 aces like lightning bolts, Sampras looked under control in a solid tuneup for the rest of the tournament. In one first-round match, he progressed further in the draw than he did a year ago. Last year, he was forced to withdraw before his first match with a back injury, which gave him a first real brush with his tennis mortality.</p>
        <p>It also ignited discussions about the life span of his career. Although the 29-year-old Sampras showed he was still dangerous and dominant on grass when he won his record 13th Grand Slam at Wimbledon in July, the ATP is concerned about the future popularity of the game. To promote the young players, the tour has begun a marketing campaign with the catch phrase: ''New Balls, Please.''</p>
        <p>''It's an interesting slogan,'' Sampras said with a smile. ''I think it's a sign of what the ATP is trying to do, how they're trying to push the young guys. A lot of people in the public don't know the young Europeans. We'll see how the marketing strategy unfolds. I admire the effort.</p>
        <p>''Andre and I aren't going to play 5 or 10 years. But for the next couple of years, I think we'll contend for the majors. It's a sign of the tour marketing for the young guys. It's no insult to me or like they're pushing me out.''</p>
        <p>The tour still needs Sampras. He and Agassi still sell. But in many ways, the women's tour is in far better shape. With rivalries and entertaining personalities, with the obsession over Anna Kournikova and with the Williams sisters phenomenon, the women are front and center. And as the day began to unfold in Round 1, the women provided one of the more intense matches. After the rain left fans scurrying to the shops and taking cover beneath the eaves, the puddles turned into reflecting pools for Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario.</p>
        <p>Faced with a 90-minute rain delay, she had time to contemplate the approach that undid her in the first set, which she dropped, 5-7, to Joannette Kruger, ranked 63rd on the tour.</p>
        <p>''I definitely think the rain delay helped me to realize a lot of what I was doing wrong,'' said Sanchez-Vicario, who won, 5-7, 6-4, 7-6 (2), even though Kruger had a chance to serve for the match. ''I came back hitting well again. I was able to win. I probably let her play too much. But I think at the end, I pulled it out well.''</p>
        <p>Hingis had an easier time. She had never played Jidkova but quickly deciphered the best approach to beating her. Although she is not looking ahead, she knows what's looming: a potential meeting against Venus Williams in the semifinals. Even though she has been rattled by Williams's power in the past, Hingis appears to be mentally steeled to face her.</p>
        <p>''I think people don't understand why I'm up there,'' said Hingis, referring to her No. 1 ranking. ''The fans, when they watch me, I don't hit the ball as hard as Venus. But you know, I've got a pretty good all-around game.</p>
        <p>''I've had to deal with things, like being No. 1, the pressure. I think now I've survived quite a bit, and I think I can improve my game again.''</p>
        <p>No redesign necessary. No additives required.</p>
        <p>''My life is too nice,'' said Hingis, who bristled when asked if she would ever think of taking supplements to help her build up strength. ''If I start taking something else to bulk myself up to get bigger, it's not worth it for me. I think my speed and quickness is my game anyway. If I get bigger, I just get slower, and that's not my game.''</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>The Colombian FABIOLA ZULUAGA, ranked No. 34, withdrew yesterday because of tendinitis in her right shoulder. The lucky loser ALICIA MOLIK of Australia will replace her.</p>
