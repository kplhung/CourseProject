        <p>Gary Taylor was ready to be a free agent. Just as Internet job-search sites and articles in new-economy magazines encourage people to do, Mr. Taylor had decided to quit his job. In this high-desert city of low unemployment and fast growth, Mr. Taylor, a glass installer, thought he could find something much better.</p>
        <p>Within six weeks of casting about, Mr. Taylor had an offer from a utility company to work on one of its growing number of temporary projects. And local technology companies had dozens of open jobs. But there seemed to be a problem with every prospect. Either it did not pay enough to support his wife and three children, he said, or it lacked the health-care benefits to cover them.</p>
        <p>In the end, he stayed in his current line of work, though he found a higher paying job. His wife, meanwhile, went to work part-time as a secretary and insurance sales representative. ''There are jobs out there,'' Mr. Taylor said, ''but I found the wages were not high enough for me to switch industries and support a family. At 41 years of age, it's very difficult to step into a new field even in a booming economy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor represents the new face of the still-anxious American worker. Economists say few people fret over whether they can find jobs in the 10th year of the nation's longest stretch of uninterrupted economic growth. But many employees say they are concerned about whether they can keep up with technological change and take advantage of opportunities in the sort of new-economy companies that are transforming places like Boise. And many either fear what will happen to their current job or -- like Mr. Taylor -- have looked but did not find another employment opportunity good enough to persuade them to jump.</p>
        <p>This new-style job anxiety does not cut as deeply as the pain felt all across what was called the Rust Belt in the 1980's, when waves of blue-collar workers lost jobs as one American industry after another retooled to face heightened foreign competition. And it does not carry the pathos of the early 1990's, when many white-collar employees faced downsizing during and after a recession that led to another round of efficiency-driven cutbacks.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the constant turnover in today's job market is exciting for many young, well-educated workers.</p>
        <p>But economists say that the lingering uncertainties within the nation's 140-million-strong work force help to explain why wage pressures, while on the upswing, remain more modest than they were in the milder and shorter economic booms of the recent past.</p>
        <p>''The evident insecurity felt by workers,'' Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said recently, echoing similar comments he has made on several occasions, is probably a result of ''a fear of job skill obsolescence.''</p>
        <p>This seems like a strange time for the issue to raise its head. The contradictions of the early years of the 1990's, when consumer spending, corporate profits and share prices all rose rapidly but the median wage was falling, have largely ended. A record percentage of Americans now say they think that jobs are plentiful, and the number of people with the confidence to quit voluntarily has steadily grown since 1996.</p>
        <p>But if concerns over the availability of work have receded, worries over the quality of those jobs remain a signature part of the economy for many people. And while Americans acknowledge an abundance of jobs, a surprising number still report that they fear being laid off in the near future. Even in boomtowns like Boise -- with thriving high-technology companies and an unemployment rate of about 3.5 percent compared with the nationwide average of 4 percent -- corporate mergers and constant efforts to increase productivity have left many people uneasy.</p>
        <p>All this stands in contrast to the previous record-long expansion in the 1960's. Back then, said Richard Curtin, the director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan, ''the only issue with living standards was how fast they would improve.''</p>
        <p>The current tension between prosperity and insecurity is also playing a role in the presidential campaign, analysts said, as Vice President Al Gore has tried both to claim credit for the economy's strong performance and to soothe traditional Democratic Party constituencies who may not be keeping up with pledges to improve education and health care. George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, faces a similar tension in pushing a broad-based tax cut that is supposed to offer financial relief to the middle class, but that has been attacked as too generous to the wealthy and as an excessive drain on future budget surpluses.</p>
        <p>''These times are generally very scary,'' said Marcia Craig, an executive assistant at Boise Cascade, who had to change jobs last year when her previous employer, Ore-Ida Foods, moved to Pittsburgh. ''It seems that no matter what you've done, no matter how long you've done it, there are kids coming out of school that are going to knock your socks off,'' said Ms. Craig, who is raising two teenage boys.</p>
        <p>In fact, a generation gap has emerged at work. Younger employees, particularly those with a strong educational background, often view today's job market as a giant bazaar where their skills are handsomely rewarded.</p>
        <p>''My grandmother gets nervous every time I take a new job,'' said Jill Feeler, 30, who since 1996 has worked for a bank, a hospital and now for Hewlett-Packard, in the marketing department here. ''She says, 'What about your pension?' I'm like, 'Pension, shmension. It's 401(k)'s, grandma.' ''</p>
        <p>Workers like Ms. Feeler, who has both a bachelor's degree and an M.B.A. from Boise State University, say it does not bother them that the bonds between companies and employees have loosened over the last decade. They have a hard time imaging spending 20 years with one employer anyway.</p>
        <p>And they are grateful for all the pay raises and job offers many have received. Debra Bell, a recent engineering graduate of Brigham Young University, for instance, moved to Boise this summer with her sister and two friends. All quickly received full-time job offers, Ms. Bell, an engineer at Micron Technology, said, including the two who had not yet graduated from college and were coming to Idaho just for the summer.</p>
        <p>For most older workers -- be they carpenters and government employees here who have received scant raises in recent years or bank managers watching their companies merge -- the changes are more unsettling. The message from companies, said Jerry Bresina, an employee of Idaho Power for the last 27 years, is: What you did yesterday is not good enough today.</p>
        <p>''That's a tough pill to take,'' Mr. Bresina said, noting that Idaho Power has sent him to more classes in the last five years than in the previous 20 years altogether.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor, the glazier, added, ''I don't think we're humanly engineered for the stress level.'' With his wife planning to become a full-time worker this fall, their children can look forward to more ''fish-stick and macaroni-and-cheese dinners,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Aggravating the uncertainty, many workers say, are a number of trends that the low unemployment rate does not capture. People are working harder -- per family, three more hours a week than a decade ago, according to the Economic Policy Institute -- complicating other areas of life. And household debt is up while health insurance coverage is down, raising the stakes for people who do leave their jobs.</p>
        <p>Boise, Idaho's capital, is a particularly poignant example of the contradictions. An old gold-mining town, Boise has evolved from a city filled with headquarters of manufacturing and food companies to one that boasts Micron, a semiconductor maker, as its largest employer and a Hewlett-Packard office of 4,000 workers.</p>
        <p>The city ''has transformed itself from a prototypical old-economy area to a new-economy area,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa., which tracks regional statistics.</p>
        <p>Help-wanted signs are common, despite an influx of new workers. The local economy, covering a metropolitan area of about 450,000 people, is growing more quickly than the rest of the nation, according to Economy.com. And compared with the rest of Idaho, where agriculture and heavy industry dominate, the city is wealthy and becoming more so.</p>
        <p>But there is also churn in Boise. The most telling example may be Ore-Ida, a company that sells potatoes, the region's signature product, to the world and even has Idaho as part of its corporate name. Travelers who step off planes into the small airport here are still greeted by an advertisement for the company. ''Welcome to Boise,'' it says. ''A city we've been proud to call home for over a quarter-century!''</p>
        <p>In reality, all that is left of Ore-Ida in Idaho -- besides the ad -- are four employees closing up shop in an office just east of downtown. H. J. Heinz, which owns Ore-Ida, has moved it to Pittsburgh over the last two years to combine it with its Weight Watchers frozen-food line to save money. Boise lost some 300 jobs in the process.</p>
        <p>It is hardly the only turmoil here. West One Bancorp was bought by U.S. Bancorp in 1995, and First Security is disappearing into Wells Fargo. Hewlett-Packard has shed many of its production jobs but is adding white-collar workers. Albertson's, a fast-growing supermarket company based in Boise, has been trying to integrate its operation with the American Stores Company, which it bought last year.</p>
        <p>Across the country, mergers have more than quadrupled in the last decade to about 8,000 a year, according to Mergerstat, leaving jobs in jeopardy in nearly every instance. And corporate relocations have roughly doubled in the last four years, according to Site Selection Magazine in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>But to judge from Ore-Ida, losing a job today does not mean what it did a few years ago. Nearly all of the company's former employees seem to have received job offers elsewhere. A surprising number are earning a salary close to their old one, say both the workers and Bae Emilson, a consultant with the outplacement firm Drake Beam Morin that Heinz is paying to help the employees with their job search.</p>
        <p>While they say they miss their old colleagues, some even consider Ore-Ida's departure to be a good development. ''Almost every single person I know says this is the best thing that has happened to them,'' Ms. Craig said. Her salary at Boise Cascade is slightly lower than what Ore-Ida was paying her, and her new job as an executive assistant is a notch lower. But she finds the work more creative -- a discovery she suspects she never would have made had she not been laid off.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the Ore-Ida alumni agree that few of them will ever feel as secure in their jobs as they once did. That view is common in Boise, not just among those who have had to change jobs but also with those who have only heard about dislocation through friends or the local newspaper.</p>
        <p>Ms. Craig said she now keeps her resume updated, especially after Boise Cascade considered eliminating her department only weeks after she arrived. ''I have a different attitude,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Miren Lolley, who ran Ore-Ida's information technology department, has decided to use her severance pay to take about a year off after working for the company for 21 years. Then she hopes to become a consultant so she can control her own schedule, leaving time to eat lunch and dinner with her friends and two sons, as she has been able to do since Ore-Ida left.</p>
        <p>In the future, Ms. Lolley said, she wants to avoid working long hours for a company without knowing whether her job is secure. ''Nobody,'' she said, ''trained us for that.''</p>
