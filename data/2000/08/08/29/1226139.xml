        <p>British brokers and traders had a hard enough time absorbing the idea that a German might soon be running the London Stock Exchange. But a Swede?</p>
        <p>OM Gruppen A.B., which owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange, may not succeed in its audacious and unsolicited bid to acquire the venerable and much bigger London exchange. But it could well unravel the already fraying plan of the L.S.E. to merge with the Deutsche Borse A.G. in Frankfurt, and it provides another example of how Europe's new generation of competitors often come from unexpected quarters.</p>
        <p>Last week, just three weeks before shareholders of the London exchange and Deutsche Borse were scheduled to vote on a full merger, OM Gruppen made an informal cash-and-stock bid of about $:800 million, or $1.18 billion, for the L.S.E. The London exchange rejected the offer, arguing that merging with the Frankfurt exchange would provide a stronger base in the long term. OM executives are now weighing a hostile takeover bid and are expected to spell out their plans later this week.</p>
        <p>In response, executives at the Frankfurt stock exchange said today that they would consider sweetening their offer if they saw the need. But people close to the German exchange admit the issue is politically sensitive, because London and Frankfurt officials labored to come up with an exchange of shares that amounted to a ''merger of equals.'' Increasing the offer would turn the deal into a takeover and would probably increase the hostility of many smaller brokerage companies that are already upset about having to adopt a new trading system.</p>
        <p>People on all sides are struggling to provide a pan-European trading system, because balkanized national exchanges are under increasing pressure from new electronic trading networks that are faster, cheaper and potentially better suited to an integrated European marketplace.</p>
        <p>The Stockholm Stock Exchange is far smaller than London's or Frankfurt's. But its parent company, founded in 1985 with nine people, is a fast-growing vendor of trading technology and has a market value of about $3.7 billion, at least three times that of the London exchange.</p>
        <p>''They are not only a stock exchange; they are a technology company,'' said Andreas Walther, chief financial officer of OZ Banken, a Swiss investment firm that owns 2.6 percent of OM.</p>
        <p>Besides running the Swedish stock and derivatives markets, OM has supplied trading and information systems to the U.K. Power Exchange, the California Power Exchange, futures markets from Hong Kong to Seoul and stock markets from Oslo to Sydney, Australia. In May, it started a new electronic options exchange in New York called the International Securities Exchange. And, in partnership with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, it is starting its own pan-European stock-trading network called Jiway.</p>
        <p>''They are commercial players in a mutual world, which is what sets them apart,'' said Thomas Johansson, an analyst at Enskilda Securities in Stockholm. ''They are more aggressive than the others.''</p>
        <p>The biggest distinction between OM and most of Europe's other stock exchanges is its history as a publicly traded company. Started originally as a company to trade Swedish derivatives, it went public in 1987 and then orchestrated a takeover of the Stockholm stock exchange in 1999. Though the merger with the stock exchange was quite recent, OM itself was always run as a for-profit corporation rather than a cooperative controlled by its members.</p>
        <p>In the six months ended in June, revenue climbed 52 percent over the previous year, to 1.4 billion Swedish kroners, or about $150 million. OM's stock price has more than doubled so far this year, to 450 kroner from about 185. Its biggest investors include Investor A.B., the huge holding company controlled by the Wallenberg family, which owns about 15 percent of its shares.</p>
        <p>Per E. Larsson, OM's 39-year-old chief executive and one of its co-founders, declined to be interviewed today. But when officials of the London exchange announced and rejected OM's informal offer on Friday, Mr. Larsson dismissed the rebuff as ''predictable'' and insisted that ''we are determined that the London market should have a better alternative'' to its proposed German merger.</p>
        <p>Many analysts doubt that OM Gruppen will be successful if it tries a hostile takeover of the London exchange. Though the L.S.E. ended its mutual status and sold shares in itself earlier this year, most of its stock is held by the banks and brokerage firms that are members of the exchange. Many of those companies are much more worried about the exchange's long-term strategic position than its current share price, and they are likely to agree with exchange officials who say it makes more sense to merge with a relatively big exchange than a small one. To succeed, an acquiring company would have to get 75 percent of the shareholders behind it.</p>
        <p>But there is widespread unhappiness about the German-British merger in London. Smaller trading companies are upset about the costs of installing new equipment to run the Deutsche Borse's electronic trading system, called Xetra. In addition, British regulators were surprisingly critical in a report last week, insisting that exchange officials had failed to explain themselves on many important issues.</p>
        <p>''My own opinion is that neither of the plans will succeed,'' Mr. Johansson of Enskilda Securities said.</p>
