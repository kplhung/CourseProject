        <p>First there was the deluge that wiped out the narrow private road that was the only access to Peg Ziegler's house and replaced it with a rubble- and rock-strewn stream. Then came the red tape.</p>
        <p>Two weeks after an intense storm dropped more than 14 inches of rain in a single day on this mountainous, lake-dotted section of western New Jersey, the cleanup and the coping continue for dozens of families like Ms. Ziegler's. In addition to having to walk on jerry-built bridges of fallen trees and lashed-together two-by-sixes to get to their homes, many now face the more daunting task of getting dams fixed and streams relocated.</p>
        <p>And in the case of Sparta Glen Brook, which once gently babbled past the Ziegler home before it suddenly raged two weeks ago and wiped out the road, that means officials must coordinate help from at least two state environmental agencies, a couple of federal emergency assistance agencies, two local governmental agencies and a homeowners' association if they are to get all the funding, approvals, engineering specifications and impact statements necessary to put the brook, a protected trout stream, back where it was.</p>
        <p>''I just know it's going to be a long time,'' said Ms. Ziegler, who suggested that it would be at least until Christmas before she and five other families who depended on the washed-out road get even a temporary solution. ''Most of us don't have much water damage in our homes, but we have the red tape of the whole deal.''</p>
        <p>But even as Ms. Ziegler fretted, Federal Emergency Management Agency officials, who had made the Sparta Glen Brook problem a priority, said today that Christmas would come early for the residents along the creek's banks. The agency had agreed to pay for a temporary road to their homes, they said, while the officials continued to work for a final and comprehensive solution.</p>
        <p>''This was one of our priorities, and all of the players were here on the scene to solve this,'' said Peter Martinasco, the coordinating officer for the agency, as he announced the decision after meetings over two days with state, federal and local agencies. ''The president sent us here to fix things, and that is what we are doing.''</p>
        <p>[As federal emergency officials began to address the devastation of one highly focused summer deluge, another hit south of here Sunday night with less spectacular results.  The slow-moving storm dumped up to four inches of rain in parts of Union and Somerset Counties, causing mudslides that temporarily closed Route 22 around Green Brook.]</p>
        <p>The decision by Mr. Martinasco came at the end of a week in which the federal agency began distributing the first six loan checks approved by the Small Business Administration (a total of $286,900) as well as 96 other checks totaling $285,403 for individual assistance. Those recipients were selected from the 650 applications filed since areas of Sussex and Morris Counties were declared a disaster area by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>According to figures compiled by the state chapter of the Red Cross, 2 houses in Morris County were destroyed, 75 had major damage and 727 had relatively minor damage. In Sussex County, 6 houses were destroyed in the flooding, 15 had major damage and 55 had minor damage.</p>
        <p>Work is under way to replace three bridges in Sussex County that were washed away and to repair three  that were weakened, said Carmine Marchiando, the county administrator. Shoring up sections of State Route 15, the area's lifeline, has been completed.</p>
        <p>Washed-out secondary roads remained largely a local problem. ''It's a mess and there is extensive work involved,'' said Bob Post, the Sussex County road supervisor. ''But it's not a whole lot of miles of road nor is it the heaviest traveled roads. But the damage is extensive where there is damage.''</p>
        <p>Disaster officials and others here continue to marvel at the surgical  nature of the localized storm, which drenched a compact area in the towns of Sparta, Jefferson, Byram and Ogdensburg. Mayor Douglas Martin of Sparta said some people on one side of the 17-square-mile township could not believe that the minor storm they experienced was the same one that required the evacuation of some 300 families in other parts of the township.</p>
        <p>Randy Earl, 43, a chemical engineer whose three-acre, parklike backyard on the banks of Sparta Glen Brook had been a local showplace, tried to describe for a visitor what it looked like before flooding dumped four to six feet of dirt, rocks and tree stumps on it. But he had trouble pointing out just where the three fish ponds, two gazebos, several hundred feet of rubble-rock walls and landscaped stands of barberry, rhododendron and dogwood had been.</p>
        <p>As he looked down, he spied a bull frog on the edge of the rerouted brook. ''That's the first thing I have seen that really belongs here,'' said Mr. Earl, noting that he had stocked his ponds with bull frogs. ''Everything else from those ponds -- the bass, the perch, the sunnies, the trout -- are all probably in the Hudson by now.''</p>
        <p>Barbara Nemeth, who lives about a mile up the brook from Mr. Earl, is from a community of 28 families around Glen Lake who were spared a break in their dam but were left stranded when a bridge over the brook, which leads to their community, was washed away.</p>
        <p>In order to go anywhere now, they have to negotiate a temporary footbridge that is little more than a series of planks precariously set on what is left of the mangled guardrail and toppled concrete footings of the destroyed bridge.</p>
        <p>''Who would have thought you would have to have flood insurance on a mountain?'' Ms. Nemeth said as she made her daily trip across the footbridge to head to her part-time job at the Sparta Board of Education.  ''I'm getting a lot of exercise with this walking, but this is unbelievable and like something out of the movies.''</p>
        <p>Chris Oelkers, carrying his baby daughter, Juliana, in one arm and her stroller in the other, was visibly nervous as he walked over the sagging footbridge and looked over his shoulder toward his wife, Lisa, who is eight months pregnant. They do not cross in the dark, he said.</p>
        <p>''It's a hassle just going out,'' he said, adding that since the bridge is out, the only way to drive from his house to the center of Sparta, just a mile and a half away, was a roundabout route of 25 miles.</p>
