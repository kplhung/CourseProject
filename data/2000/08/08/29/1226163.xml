        <p>Editorial endorsements: Incumbent Repr Eliot Engel in New York's 17th Congressional District; Lorraine Coyle Koppell for New York State Senate from 34th District, Ruth Hassell-Thompson from 33rd District and Felix Rosado from 28th District (M)</p>

        <p>In New York's important primary on Sept. 12, the Bronx has become a particularly intense political battleground under Roberto Ramirez, the borough's Democratic political kingpin and one of the city's senior Hispanic leaders. Mr. Ramirez, who resigned this year from his Bronx Assembly seat, says he wants to focus on promoting other candidates. While this may be little more than an effort to extend his political reach, Mr. Ramirez's interference in the Bronx political scene has also brought a renewed vigor to several primary battles. In some cases, victory in the primary is tantamount to election.</p>
        <p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES -- 17th District, Bronx-Westchester. After six terms in Congress, Representative Eliot Engel this year became the rare incumbent deprived of a local party's backing. While Mr. Engel has support among Westchester Democrats, Mr. Ramirez decided to use his Bronx clubs to support Mr. Engel's opponent, State Senator Larry Seabrook. Mr. Seabrook is black, Mr. Engel is white, a difference that has become the unfortunate focus of this bitter contest in a district that is increasingly dominated by black and Hispanic voters.</p>

        <p>In New York's important primary on Sept. 12, the Bronx has become a particularly intense political battleground under Roberto Ramirez, the borough's Democratic political kingpin and one of the city's senior Hispanic leaders. Mr. Ramirez, who resigned this year from his Bronx Assembly seat, says he wants to focus on promoting other candidates. While this may be little more than an effort to extend his political reach, Mr. Ramirez's interference in the Bronx political scene has also brought a renewed vigor to several primary battles. In some cases, victory in the primary is tantamount to election.</p>
        <p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES -- 17th District, Bronx-Westchester. After six terms in Congress, Representative Eliot Engel this year became the rare incumbent deprived of a local party's backing. While Mr. Engel has support among Westchester Democrats, Mr. Ramirez decided to use his Bronx clubs to support Mr. Engel's opponent, State Senator Larry Seabrook. Mr. Seabrook is black, Mr. Engel is white, a difference that has become the unfortunate focus of this bitter contest in a district that is increasingly dominated by black and Hispanic voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Engel has not been a particularly dynamic congressman, but he has been dutiful, working well on constituent issues for all ethnic groups in his many district offices. Despite Mr. Seabrook's appealing personality, his flagrant absenteeism has been noticed even in Albany, and his record does not merit a move up the political ladder. Mr. Ramirez's support for Mr. Seabrook is more an effort to expand his own political influence than a judgment on the merits of the candidates. We endorse Mr. Engel in this race.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK STATE SENATE -- 34th District, Bronx-Westchester. Lorraine Coyle Koppell, a lawyer and Democratic Party activist, is running against Michael Benedetto, a school teacher who has the support of Mr. Ramirez. What makes this race so crucial for Democrats statewide is that the winner should have a real chance against Senator Guy Velella, the longtime Republican incumbent. The Democrats in the Bronx have long enjoyed a cozy working relationship with Mr. Velella, and Mr. Benedetto appears to have been chosen as a primary challenger because he would be the far weaker Democratic competitor against Mr. Velella. Ms. Koppell, wife of former Attorney General Oliver Koppell, offers voters in this district a better and more independent choice. We endorse Ms. Koppell.</p>
        <p>33rd District, Westchester-Bronx. In the seat vacated by Mr. Seabrook, Assemblyman Samuel Bea competes with Ruth Hassell-Thompson, a member of the Mount Vernon City Council. Mr. Bea is a veteran lawmaker with more than five years of legislative experience. But Ms. Hassell-Thompson would add much-needed energy to the Democratic majority in Albany's upper house. We endorse Ms. Hassell-Thompson.</p>
        <p>28th District, Manhattan-Bronx. In the 22 years that Olga Mendez has represented this largely Democratic district, she has increasingly allied herself with the Republicans and Republican policies, gaining little advantage for her area and robbing her constituents of a representative voice in Albany. Even so, Mr. Ramirez has supported her instead of her Democratic primary opponent, Felix Rosado. Mr. Rosado offers a fresh view and some hope that the representation of this district will improve. We endorse Mr. Rosado.</p>
