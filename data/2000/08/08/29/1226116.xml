        <p>FRANCE: INTERIOR MINISTER SET TO QUIT -- The prickly and outspoken interior minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, will resign today, French news organizations reported, quoting government officials claiming to be privy to a conversation between the minister and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. Mr. Chevenement, who has resigned from two previous governments on matters of principle, publicly disagreed with Mr. Jospin's plan to grant greater autonomy to Corsica.</p>

        <p>SWITZERLAND: NESTLE PAYING HOLOCAUST FUNDS -- Nestle will contribute $14.6 million to the $1.25 billion settlement between Swiss banks and Jewish groups to settle claims over Holocaust-era victims' accounts. The Swiss-based food giant said it is making the payment because it is ''either certain or it may be assumed'' that some of its companies in countries under Nazi control had probably used slave labor. Contributions will also be made to similar funds in Germany and Austria, it said.</p>

        <p>NETHERLANDS: LOCKERBIE TRIAL DELAYED -- Wrangling over potentially crucial Central Intelligence Agency documents forced another adjournment of the Lockerbie bombing trial, further delaying testimony by Abdul Majid Giaka, a Libyan former double agent. The chief prosecutor, Lord Advocate Colin Boyd, said the C.I.A. had allowed the parties to see more information than it had ever before revealed to a foreign court. Defense lawyers have demanded time to examine the new information, texts of cables between the agency and Mr. Giaka.</p>

        <p>IRELAND: SWIFT JUSTICE -- Failed asylum seekers face swift expulsion from Ireland under legislation approved by the Supreme Court and signed by President Mary McAleese. Immigrants who are not granted asylum will be allowed 14 days to apply for a judicial review of their case. The number of asylum seekers has reached about 1,000 a month, compared with 39 in the whole of 1992. Most of them come from Africa and Eastern Europe.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: NEW HEAD-SCARF BAN -- The authorities have banned the Islamic head scarf from private teaching institutes where tens of thousands of students prepare for their university entrance examination, the leading daily Milliyet reported. The Education Ministry already enforces the ban in public schools.</p>

        <p>SOMALIA: NEW PRESIDENT OPPOSED -- Somalia's new president said he planned to name a government to consolidate his rule, but warlords who control Mogadishu, his nation's capital, dismissed his election by a parliament in exile in Djibouti and vowed to block him. Abdiqassim Salad Hassan, the new president, said he wanted to demonstrate that his government is determined to establish control over the fractured nation, which has not had a president or central administration since 1991. But Mogadishu warlords stepped up threats to prevent the new government from taking office.</p>

        <p>SIERRA LEONE: OPTIMISM ON CAPTURED BRITONS -- Officials from Sierra Leone, Britain and the United Nations continued negotiations with renegade soldiers for the release of 11 British troops held hostage since Friday. ''Continued dialogue is going on between the West Side Boys, the British and the U.N.,'' Lt. Cmdr. Tony Cramp of the British Army said. ''The fact that we are talking with them clearly indicates that there is hope for their release.''</p>

        <p>ZAMBIA: NEW PARTY -- A new political party, the first to be led by a woman, has been formed in Zambia, ahead of presidential elections scheduled for next year, the leader announced. Gwendoline Konie, a former longtime diplomat, announced the formation of the Social Democratic Party, which she said would fight to promote youth and women's issues. Ms. Konie, 61, served as ambassador to the United Nations and was an envoy to Scandinavia.</p>

        <p>CANADA: QUEBEC VOTE SEEN -- Quebec's surging economy will embolden residents of the largely French-speaking province to vote to separate from Canada, the provincial premier, Lucien Bouchard, 61, predicted at a convention of his ruling Parti Quebecois. Since the 1995 referendum, which the separatists narrowly lost, Quebec's unemployment rate has fallen to 8.8 percent from 14 percent, and a $4 billion budget deficit has been turned into the first surplus in 40 years. Mr. Bouchard did not set a date for a third vote in 20 years on Quebec separation, but said his party would start campaigning this fall.</p>

        <p>VENEZUELA: 3 WOMEN PICKED FOR CABINET -- Saying he needed to make ''tactical, but not strategic'' changes in his cabinet after his landslide electoral victory last month, President Hugo Chavez has named three women to ministerial positions. Mr. Chavez left his much-criticized economic policy-making team intact, but moved the current ministers of production and commerce, labor, and environment and natural resources to ambassadorial posts in three countries that Venezuela sees as important to its oil-based diplomacy: China, Mexico, and Algeria.</p>

        <p>WEST BANK: HAMAS TO TRY TERROR SUSPECT -- Palestinians said they would try a suspect named as one of Israel's most-wanted terrorists, whom they captured after he escaped a botched Israeli Army raid that left three soldiers dead, possibly by ''friendly fire.'' Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, a Hamas leader wanted in connection with a string of attacks that have killed dozens of Israelis, fled wounded after the gunfight in the West Bank village of Asira al Shamaliya. Israeli officials have called for Mr. Abu Hanoud, 33, to be handed over.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: BOMB BLAST AVERTED -- The police said they prevented a ''very big catastrophe'' by defusing a pipe bomb found hidden in a backpack near a busy Jerusalem intersection. So far, no terrorist group has claimed responsibility for planting the bomb.</p>

        <p>IRAN: POLICEMAN DIES IN UNREST -- A police sergeant was killed and four policemen were wounded in unrest in the western city of Khorramabad, scene of earlier clashes between hard-line vigilantes and pro-reform protesters, the official news agency said. A witness said more than 10,000 people demonstrated against an order by authorities to halt a nationwide gathering of Iran's biggest pro-reform student organization.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>IRAQ: ALLIED BOMBING -- American and British planes bombed targets in northern Iraq in the second straight day of raids, an Iraqi military spokesman said. The spokesman did not mention any casualties, but said Iraqi air defense units fired on the jets and forced them to return to their bases in Turkey. Baghdad said in a letter circulated at the United Nations that American and British jets had killed 311 Iraqis in southern Iraq and wounded 927 more since December 1998.</p>

        <p>KYRGYZSTAN: PRESIDENT RUNNING AGAIN -- President Askar Akayev said he would seek another term in office when his country holds presidential elections in October. Mr. Akayev, a 56-year-old former scientist and Communist Party functionary who has been Kyrgyzstan's only president since independence in 1991, is considered likely to be re-elected with a comfortable majority.</p>

        <p>INDIA: OUTLAW'S DEMANDS MET -- A court in southern India granted conditional bail to 51 prisoners after India's most-wanted outlaw, Koose Muniswamy Veerappan, demanded their release in return for freeing Rajkumar, an abducted movie star, officials said. The 51 will be freed if they provide financial guarantees, a senior state official in Karnataka said. Rajkumar, 72, a cult figure in Karnataka, was taken from a farm in neighboring Tamil Nadu.</p>

        <p>Correction:  August 30, 2000, Wednesday  A headline yesterday in the World Briefing column misidentified the group that said it would try Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, a leader of the militant Islamic group Hamas, who is on Israel's most-wanted list of suspected terrorists. It is the Palestinian Authority that will put him on trial, not Hamas.</p>
