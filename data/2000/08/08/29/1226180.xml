        <p>Tim Hardaway's knees are swollen, ice packs wrapped around them. A grueling practice for the United States Olympic team is over and the Miami point guard is hurting.</p>
        <p>If his body is sore, his ego is throbbing.</p>
        <p>''I deserve a lot more respect than I'm getting,'' Hardaway said.</p>
        <p>He has watched the Heat overhaul its roster this summer, swinging deals for Eddie Jones and Anthony Mason from Charlotte and Brian Grant from Portland.</p>
        <p>The trades, expected to be completed this week, will transform Pat Riley's mechanical and methodical Eastern Conference team into everybody's finals favorite -- a team capable of trading blows with whomever emerges from the West.</p>
        <p>With three new starters to complement Alonzo Mourning, the Heat has all the talent and improvisation to finally make sweet music on the court. There is but one problem: they have no maestro. At least not one under contract.</p>
        <p>''And without that,'' Mourning said, ''you have a lot of noise and nothing else.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway, who turns 34 Friday, is an unrestricted free agent who has seen almost every other significant player for the Heat be compensated financially -- everyone except himself. He watched P. J. Brown sign a $36 million contract and Mourning procure a $100 million deal several years ago. Even his backup, Anthony Carter, has been re-signed by Miami.</p>
        <p>As Jones and Grant prepare to sign contracts in the neighborhood of $90 million, Hardaway is seriously considering taking his talents elsewhere to secure the last payday of his career.</p>
        <p>''I'm dead serious,'' Hardaway said. ''I'll go play for a contending team like the Pacers. I'll go somewhere where they appreciate me. Right now, I'm getting no love from the Miami Heat.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway is the only player on the Olympic team not under contract with his team. He is seeking a three-year deal worth about $10 million a season. While those numbers may seem high for a player who has physically broken down the last two postseasons, the Heat's floor leader feels as if the organization owes him for his loyalty as much as longevity.</p>
        <p>''I took less money to stay there,'' he said of the deal he signed with Riley three years ago. ''He said he'd take care of me, and it hasn't happened yet. I want to be there, but I've got to look out for Tim Hardaway and Tim Hardaway's family.''</p>
        <p>Riley and Miami General Manager Randy Pfund are expected to fly to Hawaii this week to meet with Hardaway and watch him scrimmage. The Olympic team will play exhibition games Thursday against Canada and Saturday against the U.S. Select Team.</p>
        <p>Though the Heat would like to sign Hardaway for one year, the two sides will most likely arrive at some sort of compromise -- perhaps a two-year deal worth $8 million a season with a third-year option. But if negotiations don't accelerate, Mourning has promised to get further involved.</p>
        <p>''Going into this, he should have been signed,'' Mourning said. ''But it's like this: This is a cold, unpredictable business.</p>
        <p>''I know Timmy's going to be taken care of because there's a certain level of loyalty with our organization, unlike other organizations that I won't necessarily name,'' Mourning added, speaking not so inconspicuously of the Knicks and their dealings with his friend, Patrick Ewing. ''We take care of our own, and I know they're going to take care of Tim.''</p>
        <p>In 1997, the last time the Heat eliminated the Knicks from the playoffs, Hardaway had a huge series and became the primary reason Miami advanced, scoring 38 points in Game 7 of the second-round series.</p>
        <p>The Knicks are among several teams worried about Miami's off-season acquisitions. New York is concerned enough that it has made several overtures to other teams about unloading Ewing in attempt to get younger and more versatile on the front line.</p>
        <p>But the fragile chemistry of incorporating three new starters into the offense is something that may take a while.</p>
        <p>Hardaway has already thought about it.</p>
        <p>''I'm not on that team, so I'm not going to talk about the moves they made,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Heat has everything, it seems. Everything but the guy who made the big shots for the franchise the last few years, the player who made sure Mourning got the ball and the Heat had a chance at the end.</p>
        <p>As he spoke after the United States team practiced at the Lahaina Civic Center, the stout point guard who bobs up and down the court more than he runs these days could overhear an Olympic teammate nearby.</p>
        <p>''We'll take you in Seattle,'' Gary Payton said. ''I'll move to the two-spot if you want. I'll play shooting guard. I don't care. To get Tim Hardaway, it's worth it.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway, not smiling, said, ''See, at least someone appreciates me.''</p>
