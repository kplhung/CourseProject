        <p>In recent years Gerard Schwarz, the music director of Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival, has been trying to serve the wishes of loyal audiences who enjoy these summer season offerings of works by Mozart &amp; Company yet also respond to complaints from some quarters that these programs are narrowly focused and unimaginative. This season, the festival's 34th, Mr. Schwarz's balancing act must be deemed successful.</p>
        <p>A roster of excellent visiting ensembles participated, including the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the Choir of King's College, Cambridge, and the eminent Collegium Vocale of Ghent, conducted by the insightful Phillip Herreweghe, who offered two Bach programs to acknowledge the 250th anniversary of the composer's death. There were interesting chamber music programs and a series surveying the complete Haydn String Quartets.</p>
        <p>Even the concerts by the resident ensemble, the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra, had some fresh repertory to offer, including the season's final program at Avery Fisher Hall, heard on Friday night. In the first half, Mr. Schwarz conducted excerpts from Carl Maria von Weber's opera ''Der Freishutz,'' which may be the most significant opera that you almost never hear.</p>
        <p>In this 1821 work Weber virtually invented the genre of German Romantic opera. The story, a fable about a young, awkward huntsman named Max who uses magic bullets to win the hand of his beloved in a shooting contest, touched the German middle-class public at the time, the families of all those industrious merchants and businessmen who lived in the cities but, naturally, idealized the virtues of nature, country life and hunting. Musically, Weber's score is an inventive mixture of song, speech, dramatically charged recitative, expansive arias and hearty choruses. It comes from the world of Mozart's ''Zauberflote'' and leads directly to Wagner's ''Rienzi'' and ''Der Fliegende Hollander.''</p>
        <p>Inexplicably the opera seems to have lost favor with American companies. So it was good to hear these excerpts. Mr. Schwarz began with a lively account of the stirring overture. The impressive Riverside Choral Society (directed by Patrick Gardner) sang two rousing choruses. The bass Peter Rose put a wonderfully ominous spin on the aria that Kaspar, Max's competitor in the shooting contest, sings in anticipation of his own triumph. And the soprano Harolyn Blackwell performed two lighter, lyrical arias of the sassy Annchen, who offers tactical advice about dealing with men to her cousin Agathe, the opera's timid heroine.</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Blackwell's voice is not large, her sound is focused and carrying. She sang Annchen's music with agility and sprightliness. At times there was a slightly edgy quality to her tone. But that problem disappeared when she sang the soprano solos in the main work on the program, Mozart's Mass in C minor, K. 427. Here Ms. Blackwell's sound was luminous and lovely. The other soloists were also strong, including the dusky-toned mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson, the fine young tenor Anthony Dean Griffey and Mr. Rose. The Riverside Choral Society had obviously prepared the score thoroughly and sang the music with confidence and full-bodied sound.</p>
        <p>In striving to bring expression and pliant lyricism to the music Mr. Schwarz wound up sacrificing direction, shape and incisiveness. Still, this was a sensitive and rewarding performance of Mozart's most ambitious choral work, which he never completed. It brought the festival to a fitting close.</p>
        <p>MOSTLY MOZART REVIEW  Correction:  September 2, 2000, Saturday  A music review and a picture caption on Tuesday about the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra's performance of excerpts from an opera by Carl Maria von Weber at Avery Fisher Hall misspelled the title.
