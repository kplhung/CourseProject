        <p>The article ''10 Physics Questions to Ponder for a Millennium to Two'' misses a key point that has stumped particle physicists for years: the pattern of masses and interactions of the subunits of matter is nearly a complete mystery.</p>
        <p>The situation resembles that in the 1950's and 1960's, when attempts to understand the zoo of elementary particles culminated in their description in terms of quarks -- a few building blocks account for hundreds of particles.</p>
        <p>Mendeleev's periodic table began as a classification scheme. Quantum mechanics and its application to atoms and nuclei solved the puzzle. We now recognize over 100 elements and their isotopes as built of electrons, protons and neutrons.</p>
        <p>The Top 10 compilers ask if we may ever understand such details of particle physics as masses and interactions. It is worth being optimistic.</p>
        <p>History has proved us capable of not only understanding the details, but using them to validate or disprove deep theories.</p>
