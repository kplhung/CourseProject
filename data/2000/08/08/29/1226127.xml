        <p>The Republican National Committee began showing a new commercial, ''Priority MD,'' dealing with prescription drugs in nine states yesterday, taking on the issue that has grabbed center stage in the presidential campaign. The Democratic National Committee plans to answer it, starting today, in the same nine states -- Arkansas, Delaware, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Cold Harbor Films</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with a shot of prescription drug bottles. Then Mr. Bush speaking in front of an American flag, meeting with elderly people, shaking hands at an airport rally and speaking from a podium. Vice President Al Gore is shown, looking embarrassed, on television. Then, reinforcing the words of the announcer, graphics declare: ''Interfere with doctors,'' ''The Gore Prescription Plan: Bureaucrats Decide,'' and ''The Bush Rx Plan: Seniors Choose.''</p>

        <p>The Republican National Committee began showing a new commercial, ''Priority MD,'' dealing with prescription drugs in nine states yesterday, taking on the issue that has grabbed center stage in the presidential campaign. The Democratic National Committee plans to answer it, starting today, in the same nine states -- Arkansas, Delaware, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Cold Harbor Films</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with a shot of prescription drug bottles. Then Mr. Bush speaking in front of an American flag, meeting with elderly people, shaking hands at an airport rally and speaking from a podium. Vice President Al Gore is shown, looking embarrassed, on television. Then, reinforcing the words of the announcer, graphics declare: ''Interfere with doctors,'' ''The Gore Prescription Plan: Bureaucrats Decide,'' and ''The Bush Rx Plan: Seniors Choose.''</p>
        <p>The commercial closes with a glimpse of Mr. Bush, campaigning in shirt sleeves.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Narrator: Under Clinton-Gore, prescription drug prices have skyrocketed -- and nothing's been done. George Bush has a plan: add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush: Every senior will have access to prescription drug benefits.</p>
        <p>Announcer: And Al Gore? Gore opposed bipartisan reform. He's pushing a big-government plan that lets Washington bureaucrats interfere with what your doctors prescribe. The Gore prescription plan: bureaucrats decide. The Bush prescription plan: seniors choose.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- On its central claim, zero. Mr. Bush does not have a prescription drug plan. He has said he likes some elements of plans proposed in Congress, but has not endorsed any. His running mate, Dick Cheney, said on Sunday, ''We will shortly have a detailed proposal to put forth.'' When the commercial accuses Mr. Gore of favoring a plan that would let bureaucrats override doctors' prescriptions, it is mistaken. The administration proposal would involve hiring private industry managers, like those who administer insurance plans today. The managers could establish lists of drugs allowable under Medicare, but those limits could be overridden by any doctor whose prescription identified a particular drug as ''medically necessary.''</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Political advertisements that are flat wrong in essential elements are rare, and that failing may handicap their effectiveness. But otherwise it is a classic ''contrast'' commercial that both advocates a policy and attacks the opponent's approach. Extensive research has found this sort of political advertisement more effective than either pure attack advertisements or those that are only self-promotional.</p>
