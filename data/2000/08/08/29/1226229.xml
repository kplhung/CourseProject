        <p>The city's Conflict of Interest Board publicly rebuked former Police Commissioner Howard Safir yesterday for accepting a free trip to the Academy Awards last year from the chief executive of Revlon.</p>
        <p>As part of the decision, which fell short of saying Mr. Safir broke the law, the board scolded him, saying he should have known that Revlon had hired off-duty New York City police officers as part of a city program and that accepting the trip would appear improper. The City Charter forbids public servants to accept gifts worth $50 or more from companies or people who do business with the city.</p>
        <p>''A public official, particularly a high-ranking public official such as yourself, should studiously avoid any conduct that undermines the public trust and confidence in government,'' the board wrote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir, who resigned as commissioner earlier this month and had reimbursed Revlon in January for the cost of the trip, dismissed the board's finding as ''nonsense.''</p>
        <p>''I'm vindicated,'' he said. ''If I wasn't vindicated, they would have charged me with something. I don't accept their rebuke.''</p>
        <p>Events yesterday concluded a long-running investigation into the former commissioner's conduct in the case.</p>
        <p>As guests of Revlon's president and chief executive, George Fellows, Mr. Safir and his wife, Carol, flew from New Jersey to Los Angeles in March 1999 in a private Lear jet and were given a room at the Peninsula Beverly Hills Hotel and two tickets to the Oscars ceremony. The Conflict of Interest Board put a value of $7,079.21 on what the Safirs received.</p>
        <p>The public outcry focused on two issues. Some critics suggested that the gifts violated the law, and others emphasized the timing, saying Mr. Safir headed west on a well-publicized junket in the aftermath of the fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo. His critics said the trip showed that Mr. Safir was insensitive to concerns about police action in many neighborhoods, or, at a minimum, that he suffered from a tin political ear.</p>
        <p>In the decision released yesterday, the board found that Mr. Safir had failed to inquire about the relationship between Revlon and the Police Department, and, because of that oversight, had ''received, in effect, a gift from an entity doing business with the city.''</p>
        <p>The charter says that the ethics standard applies in any case in which the public official had ''known'' or ''should have known'' that a donor was engaged in city business. Violators can be fined as much as $10,000.</p>
        <p>But Joan R. Salzman, the board's chief of enforcement, said the board decided not to charge Mr. Safir because it had no precedent for what constituted a reasonable effort to determine whether someone offering a gift has business dealings with city.</p>
        <p>In its decision, the board said that from now on, in order to ensure that public officials do not run afoul of ethics provisions in the City Charter, the officials must conduct inquiries into any potential donor's business, including asking whether they have any city business. If any doubt exists, it said, the public official should take the question to the board before accepting the gift.</p>
        <p>''Henceforward, people will know that if they make the same error that he made, they are going to have fines and penalties,'' Ms. Salzman said.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Safir said the board's decision to withhold charges was a vindication, City Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, a Queens Democrat and the chairman of the council's public safety committee, said the rebuke was a victory for those who had criticized Mr. Safir for accepting the gift. Mr. Leffler noted that the Police Department had even stricter standards, which forbid officers to accept any free or discounted items not available to the public.</p>
        <p>''The average cop can't even get a sandwich, but the commissioner goes off and gets $7,000 or so worth of perks?'' Mr. Leffler said. ''I would say it makes him a hypocrite, flat out.''</p>
