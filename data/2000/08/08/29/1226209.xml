        <p>The International Olympic Committee's executive board announced today that it had approved plans to carry out tests for the banned synthetic hormone known as EPO at next month's Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Anita DeFrantz, the board member from the United States, called the approval ''a significant test.''</p>
        <p>''It is a reminder to any cowardly athlete who doesn't have confidence in himself or herself to compete without crutches or stay home,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The synthetic erythropoietin has been the performance-enhancing drug of choice in cycling and other endurance sports for much of the past decade, but the extent of the abuse was not clear until a large cache of EPO was found in an official Tour de France car driven by a Belgian employee of one of the competing teams in 1998. After that, efforts accelerated to detect the substance, which was initially developed to treat kidney transplant patients.</p>
        <p>Patrick Schamasch, the I.O.C.'s medical director, said testing would begin in Australia on Saturday and continue through the period of the Sydney Olympics, which begin Sept. 15 and conclude Oct. 1. Schamasch said that a minimum of 300 random EPO tests would be administered but that the I.O.C. hoped to administer at least a hundred more than that.</p>
        <p>The new I.O.C.-approved test requires both a blood sample and a urine sample. For reasons of hygiene, Schamasch said, the tests will be administered ''out of competition'' instead of at sports sites, where conventional urine tests are traditionally administered.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to say which sports we are going to target, but we will make sure we target the right sports,'' said Dr. Jacques Rogge, the executive board member from Belgium, who is also vice president of the I.O.C.'s medical commission.</p>
        <p>There has never been blood testing or out-of-competition testing in any form at the Summer Games. The I.O.C. modified the Olympic charter last year to allow for blood testing, and athletes will have to sign a form upon arrival in Sydney agreeing to submit to it. Rogge said that any athlete who refuses, even on religious grounds, will not be allowed to participate and any athlete who refuses after competing will be disqualified retroactively.</p>
        <p>''This is a very fine day for us,'' said Rogge, who indicated that progress had also been made toward developing a test for human growth hormone, another banned substance that remains undetectable.</p>
        <p>To test positive for EPO, an athlete must test positive in both the blood and urine samples. The urine test developed by French researchers, which could not be validated in time for use during this year's Tour de France, can detect synthetic EPO injected in the previous three days. The blood test developed by Australians, which requires 12 milliliters of blood to be removed by syringe from an athlete's arm, can detect EPO use up to 20 days after the fact. But unlike the French test, it detects EPO by an indirect method based on probabilities and young red blood cell characteristics.</p>
        <p>Because of the blood test's indirect nature, I.O.C. officials were not confident it alone could withstand legal challenges, but after the medical commission approved the two-pronged test earlier this month, the I.O.C.'s legal commission approved it on Sunday and recommended approval to the board.</p>
        <p>''Of course there will still be legal challenges,'' Rogge said. ''But we expect that the scientific validation we have and legal study we've done will convince every judge of our rights.''</p>
        <p>In another significant move today, the executive board cut the number of candidate cities for the 2008 Summer Games to 5 from 10. The survivors are: Beijing; Osaka, Japan; Paris; Toronto; and, in the least convincing fashion, Istanbul.</p>
        <p>The final vote is scheduled for next July 15, at the I.O.C. meeting in Moscow, one day before the full membership is scheduled to elect a successor to the outgoing president, Juan Antonio Samaranch. But for now and despite the vote-buying scandal involving the Salt Lake City bid that shook the Olympic movement last year, the 80-year-old Samaranch remains in charge. Today's winnowing process was the first phase of the new selection system that he lobbied belatedly to put in place in order to reduce the chronic influence-peddling that plagued the former process.</p>
        <p>I.O.C. members who are not part of the small evaluation commission are no longer permitted to visit bidding cities, and the assessments of the 10 prospective hosts were made by a working group on the basis of questionnaires filled out by the applicants and with the help of outside experts in transport, telecommunications and financial and legal affairs. In the next phase, the evaluation commission will visit the five bid cities and prepare detailed reports to present to the full membership.</p>
        <p>These five cities were eliminated from contention for 2008, in descending order of quality as determined by the working group: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Seville, Spain; Bangkok; Cairo; and Havana. Istanbul also did not meet the minimum acceptable grade established by the working group, but the executive board, essentially the board of directors, decided by a majority vote to allow Istanbul to bid because its candidacy was considered the strongest of the second tier.</p>
        <p>Beijing, Osaka, Paris and Toronto were all approved unanimously by the board, which declined to establish a pecking order, although Beijing, which lost by only 2 votes to Sydney in the bidding for the 2000 Games, is considered the early favorite. China's human rights record, considered a factor in Beijing's loss in 1993, is again expected to be a major campaign issue.</p>
        <p>''I admit that our human rights situation is not perfect, just like in every country in the world,'' the executive board member He Zhenliang of China said. ''You cannot say France has no problems. You cannot say Japan or America have no problems. But what we should do is let the Olympic Games be a means to help this country improve its social environment, including human rights, and not use this as an instrument to go against. The human rights problem is a problem that can only be solved through mutual understanding and common efforts.''</p>
