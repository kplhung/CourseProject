        <p>Editorial urges mainstream religious leaders to speak out against new strategy by some students at Southern high schools to engage in unsanctioned and 'spontaneous' prayers at start of football games to get around recent Supreme Court decision banning as unconstitutional school-sponsored student-led prayers that are broadcast over public address system (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Along with chanting school cheers, students in some Southern high schools are now standing up to recite the Lord's Prayer at the start of football games. Although the stadium prayers seem spontaneous and undirected, they are in fact part of a movement, started by Christian ministries and radio talk show hosts, to promote school prayer. The purpose is to get around a recent Supreme Court decision that banned as unconstitutional school-sponsored student-led prayers that are broadcast over the public address system.</p>
        <p>While there may be a legal and constitutional difference between prayer that is officially sponsored by the school and a more informal student-initiated pregame prayer, the impact on the audience is the same. When a crowd of 4,000 high schoolers rises to say a prayer, students who are nonbelievers or members of religious minorities are subjected to the majority's religious worship as the price of attending a school football game.</p>

        <p>Along with chanting school cheers, students in some Southern high schools are now standing up to recite the Lord's Prayer at the start of football games. Although the stadium prayers seem spontaneous and undirected, they are in fact part of a movement, started by Christian ministries and radio talk show hosts, to promote school prayer. The purpose is to get around a recent Supreme Court decision that banned as unconstitutional school-sponsored student-led prayers that are broadcast over the public address system.</p>
        <p>While there may be a legal and constitutional difference between prayer that is officially sponsored by the school and a more informal student-initiated pregame prayer, the impact on the audience is the same. When a crowd of 4,000 high schoolers rises to say a prayer, students who are nonbelievers or members of religious minorities are subjected to the majority's religious worship as the price of attending a school football game.</p>
        <p>The constitutionality of these outbreaks of prayer is heavily dependent on the facts of each case. Allowing a student to lead a prayer over the public address system would clearly be unconstitutional. Less overt forms of support by school officials may also be prohibited, depending on the degree of their involvement.</p>
        <p>But group prayer may be constitutional if school officials are truly uninvolved. In those instances, student prayers might well be considered private speech, protected by the First Amendment principles of free speech and free exercise of religion. The difficulty, of course, is determining the specific scenarios in which prayer on school grounds moves from unconstitutional government-sponsored religious worship into protected private religious activity.</p>
        <p>In past cases, the Supreme Court has ruled that schools cannot be hostile to students' religious expression. Students are free to pray privately at any time during a school day, and after-school Bible clubs are allowed to operate in most of the nation's school districts. But the court has stated repeatedly that affirmative school sponsorship of a religious message is impermissible because it sends a message to some students ''that they are outsiders.''</p>
        <p>A prayer initiated by students may pass legal muster. But its message of religious orthodoxy may be just as socially coercive for teenagers as a voice over the public address system. In that respect, it is no less threatening to religious freedom than organized school prayer. Mainstream religious leaders should speak out against a strategy that imposes religious observance on a captive school audience.</p>
