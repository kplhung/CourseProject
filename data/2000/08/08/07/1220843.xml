        <p>The high, forested mountains of southeastern Bosnia are a place to hide, and, according to current local lore, it is there, in the steep gorges or trails and high passes into neighboring Montenegro, that Radovan Karadzic has been hiding.</p>
        <p>Dr. Karadzic, the former leader of the Bosnian Serbs twice indicted by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, took refuge, according to news media reports in Bosnia last month, in the village of Celebici, right on the border with his native Montenegro.</p>
        <p>A onetime psychiatrist who led a campaign of extreme nationalism and instigated a lethal war of ethnic cleansing, he has been closely guarded since the war ended.</p>
        <p>Even men who were once his close associates say they have not seen him for two years. His influence over the Bosnian Serb republic, which he founded, is said to be waning, as officials close to him have been moved out of office, left the country or been arrested.</p>
        <p>Yet Dr. Karadzic, widely regarded as the man most culpable for the 1992-95 war in Bosnia, is still at large.</p>
        <p>His unrepentant presence glowers over every issue in this ruined society: the return of displaced people to their homes, the rule of law, cooperation of local officials and politicians with the international administration, and the failure or unwillingness of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia, known as SFOR, to arrest him.</p>
        <p>''To me he is the central one,'' said Thomas Miller, the American ambassador in Bosnia, who insists that arresting Dr. Karadzic is still a priority. ''For my government, if I had one single wish, it would be to get Karadzic. He's a war criminal, responsible for terrible things, but to his people he symbolizes resistance. If he goes, it collapses that wall of resistance.''</p>
        <p>Yet Dr. Karadzic has eluded the special squads who have steadily picked up lesser suspects -- almost one a month in the last 10 months -- and he has continued to move around the region, if with great caution and even more warily since NATO troops seized his close associate and partner in war, Momcilo Krajisnik, in April.</p>
        <p>It is five years since Dr. Karadzic was indicted, and local journalists and officials fear that despite all foreign promises, he may get away for good, sneaking into Montenegro and then Serbia, where many other war crimes suspects have found refuge.</p>
        <p>Georgios Vlachogiannis, the international governor of Foca, the Serbian nationalist stronghold closest to Celebici, said he did not believe that Dr. Karadzic was still in the area. ''There are rumors that he is moving through the Montenegrin border,'' he said. ''Some think he is moving into Serbia.''</p>
        <p>In Pale, the ski resort town outside Sarajevo that Dr. Karadzic made his capital and wartime headquarters, his daughter has reportedly been looking for a buyer for her television and radio station, Astra. That could indicate that the family is preparing to move to Serbia, one local journalist said. Dr. Karadzic's son, a businessman reputed to have ties to the widespread smuggling networks developed during the war, has lived in Belgrade for some years.</p>
        <p>Dr. Karadzic's wife, Ljiljana Karadzic, still heads the Red Cross in the Bosnian Serb republic and in July attended the celebrations in Pale marking the 10th anniversary of the founding of her husband's Serbian Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>She appears to live apart from her husband for security reasons but remains a standard bearer and praised the achievements of his party.</p>
        <p>Support for Dr. Karadzic in Pale remains outwardly strong. ''Everyone still supports him,'' said a 24-year-old who gave only his first name, Mladan. ''I think no one would betray him, despite the big reward. If he were arrested, blood would be spilled and there would be attacks on SFOR.''</p>
        <p>But others doubt that there would be unrest, pointing to the muted reaction after the arrest of Mr. Krajisnik. ''People are only interested in jobs,'' said Mayor Dragoljub Pipovic of Foca, a Serb.</p>
        <p>The governor, Mr. Vlachogiannis, says the thugs who made Foca notorious -- 12 men from Foca alone have been indicted on war crimes charges -- have gone and the atmosphere in the town has changed. ''My feeling is that after Krajisnik's arrest they left,'' he said. ''They are probably living in Serbia.''</p>
        <p>Asked why NATO peacekeepers would not arrest indicted war crimes suspects before they crossed the border, a spokesman for the force, Col. Tom Beginnes, said that it was not the force's task to pursue suspects and that they could be arrested only when encountered in the course of peacekeeping activities.</p>
        <p>Dr. Karadzic's top general, Ratko Mladic, has been living in Belgrade since the end of the Bosnian war and has been sighted there several times in recent months.</p>
        <p>Yet even Serbia may not provide a safe refuge for some men -- as Dragan Nikolic, a Serb wanted by the tribunal for crimes alleged to have been committed in a camp for Muslims near Vlasenica in 1992, found out. Mr. Nikolic, the first man indicted by the war crimes tribunal, was abducted from his home in the town of Smederevo in central Serbia in April, driven to the border with Bosnia in the trunk of a car and handed over to American troops. His abduction is said to have been organized by Serbian bounty hunters tempted by the cash reward, who have since been arrested in Serbia.</p>
        <p>The State Department has posted a $5 million reward for information leading to the arrest of the three most notorious men indicted by the tribunal, Dr. Karadzic, General Mladic and President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, who was charged for crimes committed by his troops in the Kosovo war last year.</p>
        <p>If the reward has not brought any results so far, it has certainly raised the stakes. Wolfgang Petritsch, who heads the international administration in Bosnia, said the steady stream of arrests had increased the pressure. ''The big shots are still at large,'' he said, ''but I can feel a heightened sense of nervousness.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Karadzic has gone to extreme lengths to protect himself. He never shows his face, but people know he is in Pale when they see members of his entourage around, one journalist in the town said. That last happened two to three months ago, the journalist added. Former associates say Dr. Karadzic went underground two years ago after the murder of the young deputy police chief, Srdjan Knezevic, in Pale in 1998.</p>
        <p>Dr. Karadzic is widely believed to have been behind the killing, since the influential deputy had defected to join Biljana Plavsic, then president of the Bosnian Serb republic.</p>
        <p>Ms. Plavsic, once an extreme nationalist, turned her back on Dr. Karadzic and threw in her lot with the Western officials running Bosnia before losing the presidency in late 1998. She reacted by withdrawing Dr. Karadzic's government bodyguards, according to his former defense minister, Milan Ninkovic.</p>
        <p>One of the few close associates of Dr. Karadzic still openly in circulation in Bosnia, Mr. Ninkovic remains the most powerful politician in his hometown of Doboj in the north of the country.</p>
        <p>Yet the threat of a secret indictment clearly nagged at him. He complained that peacekeepers' helicopters had started flying over his house on the outskirts of Doboj.</p>
        <p>''They often fly over the house and hover, and there is some indication that they are photographing my house,'' he said. ''I consider that there is no war crime in my past and the only problem is that I am an obstacle to my political enemies.''</p>
        <p>He served as defense minister for the last year of the war in Bosnia, and so was in office during the worst massacre of the war, at Srebrenica. He insists that he had little authority and that Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic frequently bypassed him when they issued orders to the army.</p>
        <p>He blamed General Mladic, with whom he had frequent disagreements, for Srebrenica. He was careful in his comments about Dr. Karadzic, saying the only order he had seen was for the army to surround Srebrenica, not seize it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ninkovic, like Mrs. Karadzic, defends the actions of the Bosnian Serb leadership during the war. An interview with him runs like a speech in his defense, and one that takes little account of the recent arrests and indictments of some of the most notorious Bosnian Croat war crimes suspects.</p>
        <p>''My only mistake was that I wanted to defend my own people,'' Mr. Ninkovic said, accusing the Muslim side of war crimes too. ''Who killed the 30,000 Serb war dead?'' he asked. ''Yet it is only Serbs who go to The Hague.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 9, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about the former leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, who is a fugitive from arrest for war crimes, misidentified the organization that controls the peacekeeping force that is seeking him in Bosnia. It is NATO, not the United Nations.</p>
