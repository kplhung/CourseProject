        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Bob Herbert (column, July 31) cites a prevailing pessimism among American women about their own situation and the society in which their children are growing up. Too many of these women work outside the home and have little energy to devote to their children's upbringing. Too many children must care for themselves and learn by watching television or imitating what they see on the streets.</p>

        <p>Absent parents and widespread drug use are part of a mix of troubling circumstances. Our political leaders seem to want a better social and moral climate for our youth, but one wonders if the ''wars'' on drugs and poverty are real, since we haven't seen real results.</p>
