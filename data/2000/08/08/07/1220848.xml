        <p>The worst-case scenario that quarterback Kerry Collins and the Giants' coaching staff feared Saturday night did not materialize yesterday. Tests on Pete Mitchell did not reveal a season-ending injury, but the Giants' only experienced pass-catching tight end will be out of action for the Sept. 3 opener against the Arizona Cardinals, and possibly longer.</p>
        <p>Mitchell severely sprained his left knee in the Giants' 20-8 loss to the Bears on Saturday at Giants Stadium. An M.R.I. yesterday ruled out a torn anterior cruciate ligament, an injury that would have ended Mitchell's season.</p>
        <p>After speaking with doctors, Giants Coach Jim Fassel would not put a timetable on Mitchell's return, saying only that the tight end would miss at least the opener. Fassel preferred to wait until Mitchell has more tests before making a definitive statement, but the coach did not rule out an extended absence. Yesterday's exam did not show any significant ligament tears but Mitchell will undergo a CAT scan today on his knee.</p>
        <p>''I would say right now the only procedure that would be under consideration would be a scope,'' Fassel said in a conference call, referring to possible arthroscopic surgery.</p>
        <p>Such a procedure would be used partly to examine the knee, but Fassel did not believe it would reveal further damage that would require a more serious operation.</p>
        <p>With little depth, the Giants dreaded any type of injury Saturday. But while Fassel maintained he was pleased with the first-team offense's ability to drive the field in the first half despite not scoring a touchdown, he was less optimistic when it came to replacing Mitchell. That injury could have a harrowing domino effect on the rest of the offense.</p>
        <p>As the only proven pass catcher among the team's tight ends, Mitchell was a key component to the Giants' revamped offense under the new coordinator, Sean Payton. Fassel said Mitchell's injury would not scale back the Giants' ambitious plans of opening up the passing game. ''There'll just be another guy doing it,'' Fassel said. ''As far as dropping anything, no.''</p>
        <p>Fassel discussed different candidates to fill Mitchell's role temporarily, and said he did not anticipate searching outside the organization unless ''I get some surprising news'' today.</p>
        <p>Fassel did not even mention Howard Cross, the starting tight end, because Cross is used strictly as a blocker. Beyond Cross, the options on the team are running back Sean Bennett, tight end Dan Campbell and wide receiver Joe Jurevicius. Based on their resumes alone, they are not ideal replacements.</p>
        <p>Bennett, a second-year back, has never played tight end. He has been learning the role in practice and the Giants planned to use him more as a pass catcher out of the backfield. Campbell, Mitchell's backup, has never caught a pass in two professional seasons.</p>
        <p>Jurevicius is the team's third receiver and would need to be replaced there if he saw time at tight end. The rookie Ron Dixon would then be elevated from the fourth string.</p>
        <p>It's understandable why Collins fretted after seeing Mitchell on crutches along the sideline Saturday. Collins, who hopes to benefit from the Giants' plans to loosen their offense, said Saturday it would be a blow to lose Mitchell for the season.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>After one preseason game, Coach JIM FASSEL is already prepared to revamp his special teams. ''I'll make some changes in that group right now,'' Fassel said after watching the Bears return one kickoff for 65 yards and a punt for 50. ''I can't comprehend our coverage playing like that. We showed a total lack of being able to get off a block, or we ran around blocks and opened up seams.'' . . . Perhaps no player carried as much fanfare into Saturday's game as RON DAYNE, last year's Heisman Trophy winner from Wisconsin. Fassel was impressed with Dayne in his first professional game, but said Dayne also showed the hesitation of a rookie. ''He made two guys miss where maybe in the past our guy doesn't get back to the line of scrimmage,'' Fassel said. ''He's reading correctly, but sometimes I don't think when he read it correctly he reacted to it as quickly as he has in the past. That's something that's going to take some time.'' Dayne carried 17 times for 48 yards. RON DIXON, the third-round pick out of Lambuth University, did not impress anyone with his tendency to stop-and-go on kick returns. ''He's got to learn to get the ball and go upfield,'' Fassel said. ''There's too many people who are fast on the field.'' . . . Fassel expected defensive end MICHAEL STRAHAN (back stiffness), defensive tackle KEITH HAMILTON (hamstring strain) and linebacker MIKE BARROW (sprained knee) to practice today. None played Saturday. Running back JOE MONTGOMERY, who also did not play, will practice lightly this week in anticipation of playing Friday at Jacksonville.</p>
