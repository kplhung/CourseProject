        <p>Astronomers are announcing this week that they have discovered 10 new planets and have found tantalizing hints of another multiplanet system.</p>
        <p>Where there is one planet around a star, there are likely to be more. At least, that is the view of astronomers at the University of California at Berkeley. The reason astronomers have not sighted more multiple-planet systems, they say, is simply that they have not looked long enough.</p>
        <p>Astronomers first found a planet around a Sun-like star only five years ago. The count of planet-bearing stars has now passed 40, including the 10 that will be discussed this week, but of these, only 2 have more than 1 planet.</p>
        <p>Almost all of the extrasolar planets discovered so far have been detected indirectly -- their gravitational pull causes their parent stars to wobble back and forth, which causes a slight wobble in the wavelength of light coming from the stars.</p>
        <p>Dr. Debra A. Fischer, a postdoctoral fellow at Berkeley, re-examined data from 12 stars known to have a planet to see if they contained unnoticed evidence of other planets. ''Five of them showed extra wobbles,'' Dr. Fischer said. ''That indicates the presence of some other thing there.''</p>
        <p>The unseen bodies could be other planets, dim companion stars or brown dwarfs -- small ''failed'' stars that were not quite massive enough to light up.</p>
        <p>The findings are being presented at the International Astronomical Union meeting, which opens in Manchester, England, today.</p>
        <p>The only two known multiplanet star systems are Upsilon Andromedae, 44 light-years away in the constellation Andromeda and HD 83443, which is 141 light-years away in the constellation Vela.</p>
        <p>The Berkeley team announced a year ago that they had found three planets around Upsilon Andromedae. Astronomers led by Dr. Michel Mayor of the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland announced the discovery of one planet around HD 83443 in May and will present data on the second planet at the astronomical union's meeting.</p>
        <p>The newly discovered planetary system provides a surprise to astronomers: two gaseous, giant-size planets very close to the star. One, only 3.5 million miles away from the star, completes one orbit in less than three days. The other completes its elliptical orbit in only 30 days. Mercury, the innermost planet in the solar system, is 35.5 million miles from the Sun and completes one orbit in 88 days.</p>
        <p>The HD 83443 system appears to be stable despite the gravitational tuggings between the two planets and the star.</p>
        <p>Compared with other planets discovered so far, the two around HD 83443 are also relatively small. One planet may be just slightly more massive than Saturn; the other may be half as massive as Saturn. Saturn is one-third the mass of Jupiter; most of the extrasolar planets are several times larger than Jupiter.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mayer and his colleagues also announced planets around five other stars in addition to HD 83443.</p>
        <p>Extrasolar planets have now appeared almost next door to the solar system, too.</p>
        <p>Astronomers led by Dr. William Cochran, a research scientist at the McDonald Observatory of the University of Texas, announced the discovery of a planet around a star only 10.5 light-years from Earth.</p>
        <p>The planet, around Epsilon Eridani in the constellation Eridanus, is similar to Jupiter in its distance from its star, its orbital period and its mass. But its highly  eccentric orbit would most likely disrupt the orbits of any Earth-like planets in the system.</p>
        <p>That one of the nearest stars has a planet is by itself encouraging to those looking for alien life or even civilizations.</p>
        <p>''Gosh, even when you look at the next sun out, it's got planets, too,'' said Dr. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, of Mountain View, Calif., a private astronomical group, ''suggesting that planets are as common as cheap hotels.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 8, 2000, Tuesday  An article yesterday about the discoveries of planets outside Earth's solar system misstated the number found. It was 9, not 10; one planet was observed independently by two teams of astronomers.</p>
