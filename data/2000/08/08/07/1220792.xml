        <p>Al Gore is an intellectual. In case we doubted his credentials, a recent New Yorker profile of the vice president made this clear. Mr. Gore referred to ''the Cartesian revolution,'' Reinhold Neibuhr's work and Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigms. Wonky to the point of weirdness, Mr. Gore loves nothing more than a dorm-room bull session. To Nicholas Lemann, The New Yorker writer, he held forth with uncanny fluency on ''the origins of our modern world view, and its curious reliance on specialization and ever-narrower slices of the world around us into categories.''</p>
        <p>O.K., so the man's a pedant. Faced with the threat of another bibliophobic President Bush, what card-carrying intellectual wouldn't embrace the prospect of a president who casually invokes Niebuhr and Descartes? Mr. Gore's bookish bent is tonic; his habit of convening academics and policy types to conduct informal seminars at the vice presidential mansion conjures up memories of the Kennedy era, when, as the late Alfred Kazin grandly put it, ''Intellect was in touch with power.''</p>
        <p>Why, then, do Mr. Gore's showy displays of erudition provoke in me a tremor of alarm? Is it because of their provenance? Earlier this year, Michael Wolff, a media critic for  New York magazine, dated the formation of Mr. Gore's intellectual template back to the 50's and 60's when ''Ivy League classiness'' flourished.</p>
        <p>I think a more precise date is 1966 to 1970, Mr. Gore's Harvard years. The books that Mr. Gore has cited as his intellectual touchstones -- Kuhn's ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,'' Maurice Merleau-Ponty's ''The Phenomenology of Perception,'' the work of Edmund Husserl -- adorned every bookshelf on campus, along with Emile Durkheim's ''Suicide,'' David Reisman's ''The Lonely Crowd,'' and Erik Erikson's ''Childhood and Society.'' The trouble with Mr. Gore's perpetual theorizing is that it's straight out of the 60's.</p>
        <p>In interviews, Mr. Gore presents himself as a precise and systematic thinker. He diagrams his points, dilates on English constitutional history, produces complex metaphors like ''the clockwork universe'' and the world as ''a machine of moving parts.''</p>
        <p>Yet a close scrutiny of his ideas reveals a mind in love with the existential and the Dionysian. One of his new favorites is ''The Marriage of Sense and Soul,'' by Ken Wilber, a disciple of Deepak Chopra who makes the familiar case that modern civilization has emphasized material things at the expense of the emotional and spiritual needs -- shades of Norman O. Brown, the intellectual guru of my 60's generation.</p>
        <p>Brown's masterwork, ''Love's Body,'' was a touchy-feely tract disguised as philosophy. When Mr. Gore writes, in his 1992 book, ''Earth in the Balance,'' about the ''psychic pain at the very root of the modern mind,'' and ''the experience of living in one's body as a fully integrated physical and mental being,'' one is tempted to respond with a rousing, ''Dig it!''</p>
        <p>Is this a problem? Should we expect our presidential candidates to be au courant with the latest intellectual touchstones? Why doesn't Mr. Gore demonstrate familiarity with deconstruction, with the work of Jacques Derrida or the critical legal studies pioneered by Stanley Fish?</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Gore does have ideas. It's exhilarating to hear him attacking government bureaucracy or applying business-management theory to the original principles of freedom espoused by the framers of the Constitution. In his book, he trenchantly argues that the looming environmental crisis is a moral crisis. But he needs to state these ideas plainly and forcefully, not dressed up in the intellectual platitudes of broken-spined paperbacks exhumed from his college days.</p>
        <p>Maybe in order for intellect to be in touch with power again, power should keep its distance from intellect.</p>
