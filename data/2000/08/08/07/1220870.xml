        <p>Gines Serran-Pagan has a farm. And on this farm he has some barns. And in those barns he kept some pigs and chickens and rabbits and sheep and goats. And a llama. But the pigs got loose and ate the neighbor's grass. The chickens flew the coop and ate the neighbor's flowers. The rooster crowed at all hours and disturbed the neighbor's sleep. The llama, the neighbors said, just plain stunk.</p>
        <p>So now Mr. Pagan, an internationally renowned artist, gallery proprietor and the sole owner of livestock in Southampton Village, has a court date.</p>
        <p>His neighbors, and officials from the Village of Southampton, claim that he has violated section 116-9.8 of the village code, the one that bans ownership of barnyard animals within village boundaries. Mr. Pagan says he has found a loophole in the code that allows people to keep livestock for pets or meat as long as they own a barn.</p>
        <p>The dispute has pitted Mr. Pagan and the coterie who visit his salon des artistes -- the Red Bar Atelier -- against his neighbors, the Gadomskis, who have lived in the same little house on Layton Avenue for nearly 50 years. The Spanish-born painter insists he is not just another out-of-towner with outlandish and grandiose dreams. Rather, he said, he is a preservationist who is trying to restore the old character of Southampton, a character that has been torn down and paved over by the East End land craze.</p>
        <p>''I try to recreate a colonial feeling here,'' said Mr. Pagan, a quixotic 50-year-old with a shock of curly hair, a goatee and the demeanor of an astronomy professor. ''It was fine until two little chickens started sneaking under the fence. The neighbors, they're an old cranky couple who just don't appreciate nature.''</p>
        <p>Alex and Genevieve Gadomski said they were not cranky people at all. And as for nature, they grew up on farms in rural Poland. Their position, they said, is a simple one: animals are good, just not in the middle of a subdivision. More than 30 of their neighbors agree, as does the mayor of Southampton Village, Joseph P. Romanosky Jr., who happens to be their son-in-law.</p>
        <p>''I'm living with a lot of noise and a lot of smell, and I'm a wreck,'' said Mrs. Gadomski, 79, a kindly woman. ''I've lived here a long time and always thought it was residential. If it's not, then I'm buying a horse.''</p>
        <p>The problems started as soon as Mr. Pagan bought the acre of property in 1997, both sides agree. The parcel is said to be the oldest collection of barns in the village, dating back to the 18th century. Mr. Pagan remodeled the buildings in a Mediterranean style, with an outdoor bread kiln and palazzo, and turned the place into a nonprofit gallery space and a petting zoo for schoolchildren. Mr. Pagan planted more than 100 trees around the perimeter to hide what he called the Gadomskis' ugly plastic fencing. The trees began to grow over and through the fencing, dropping pine needles in the Gadomskis'garden.</p>
        <p>In the spring of '99, the first animals were brought in: crowing roosters, wandering rabbits, flying chickens, baa-ing sheep. And the llama.</p>
        <p>When two chickens flew into his yard last year and tore up his flowers, Mr. Gadomski, 80, brought out a pellet gun. A teenager who was sent by Mr. Pagan to retrieve the chickens said the man threatened to shoot the birds. ''I admit I had the gun,'' Mr. Gadomski said. ''But I wasn't going to shoot anything. I'd like to wring that guy's neck, but I'd never shoot anything.''</p>
        <p>Responding to the complaints of the Gadomskis, the village took Mr. Pagan to court, contending that he violated the animal disturbance law in July 1999. The case was dismissed with the caveat that Mr. Pagan put his barn in order and keep the animals quiet. He got rid of the llama.</p>
        <p>''He was very aggressive anyway,'' Mr. Pagan said. ''He was spitting on everybody.''</p>
        <p>But this spring, Mr. Pagan bought three pigs. The list of the menagerie at this point read: 20 chickens, 20 ducks, 6 goats, 3 pigs, 4 sheep, sundry rabbits and guinea hens. At some point, the pigs dined on Mrs. Gadomski's lawn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pagan has been summoned to court again and is scheduled to appear Sept. 7. Mayor Romanosky wants all of the animals gone before then and has instructed the sheriff to fine Mr. Pagan $250 every day the animals remain.</p>
        <p>''It is fascism,'' the Spaniard said. ''It is total abuse of power. The mayor is their son-in-law. Is it any wonder?''</p>
        <p>Mayor Romanosky bristled at the suggestion that he was harassing Mr. Pagan to placate his in-laws. ''It's not as basic as he bought three little pigs and we're the wolf trying to blow his house in,'' the mayor said as he was joined in his office by Jonathan Foster, the village building inspector. ''And it's not because it's my in-laws. It's because he's got a ranch going on over there.''</p>
        <p>''He had a llama!'' blurted the building inspector.</p>
        <p>Bowed by the $250 fines for the trespassing chickens, Mr. Pagan clipped their wings. He got rid of everything but the goats and ducks and chickens. He even reinforced the fencing around his property. Still, the village and the Gadomskis are determined to close his barn doors.</p>
        <p>In retaliation, Mr. Pagan has started an all-out ''save the farm'' campaign. He has purchased time on local radio stations pleading for justice. He has 500 names on a petition (some local, some not). His supporters routinely call the mayor. He has taken to hiding his animals behind the barn.</p>
        <p>''I tried to make peace. I tried to meet them halfway,'' Mr. Pagan said while standing in the rain, surveying his hacienda. ''But I'm ready to go to jail for my animals.''</p>
