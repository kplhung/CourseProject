        <p>The FirstEnergy Corporation is in talks to buy GPU Inc. of New Jersey, a person close to the discussions said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Though final terms have not been reached, FirstEnergy, based in Akron, Ohio, is considering paying a premium of 20 percent to 30 percent to GPU's stock price, which closed Friday at $28.0625.

        <p>The FirstEnergy Corporation is in talks to buy GPU Inc. of New Jersey, a person close to the discussions said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Though final terms have not been reached, FirstEnergy, based in Akron, Ohio, is considering paying a premium of 20 percent to 30 percent to GPU's stock price, which closed Friday at $28.0625. GPU, based in Morristown, N.J., has 121.24 million shares outstanding, which would put the value of the deal at $4.4 billion if FirstEnergy paid the 30 percent premium. However, GPU also carries a debt load of $5.9 billion, which FirstEnergy would assume.</p>
        <p>Shares of FirstEnergy fell 1.5625 cents on Friday, to $26.9375. The company has 230.4 million shares outstanding. The switchboard at First Energy was closed last night. A spokesman for GPU said the company did not comment on reports of mergers and acquisitions.</p>
        <p>GPU, which has recently reorganized by selling off power plants, has two million customers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>FirstEnergy is an energy holding company that provides electricity to 2.2 million customers in northern and central Ohio and western Pennsylvania. It also provides energy-related products and natural gas services to customers nationwide.</p>
        <p>The utility industry has undergone some consolidation in recent months. Just last week, FPL Group, the parent of Florida Power and Light, announced plans to acquire Entergy, based in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>The electric utility industry is deregulating, and some companies see value in forming larger entities. GPU, which had net income of $215 million for the first half ended June 30, excluding nonrecurring items, has been pursuing nonregulated businesses like infrastructure construction to achieve faster growth. GPU has also had discussions with National Grid of Britain.</p>
