        <p>Four months after the federal Interior Department approved plans for an Indian casino in Monticello, N.Y., three separate developers with three different tribes are battling to bring gambling to the Catskills.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, none of the three are the same team of developer and tribe approved by the Interior Department. And, after decades of futility, many proponents are becoming increasingly worried that their best shot at bringing casinos to the Catskills may be on the brink of slipping away.</p>
        <p>''I think the window of opportunity is closing,'' said Anthony P. Cellini, supervisor of the Town of Thompson in Sullivan County. ''I think people are getting sick and tired of being promised something that comes and goes, comes and goes. There's a lot going on here, but it's all contingent on gambling.''</p>
        <p>Many residents were counting on casinos to provide thousands of jobs and bring back the tourists who until the 1970's used to flock to the now crumbling hotels and bungalow colonies scattered across the wooded mountains. With the prospect of gambling, politically connected developers have been buying property in the area in recent years.</p>
        <p>But Rusty Pomeroy, chairman of the Sullivan County Legislature, said he feared that a proposed performing arts center and redevelopment of the Laurels and Concord resorts might not work without gambling to draw newcomers to the area.</p>
        <p>''A casino is the engine that helps drive the economy for the rest of the tourism industry in the county,'' Mr. Pomeroy said.</p>
        <p>Last April, the Interior Department approved a four-year-old proposal by the St. Regis Mohawks and a company, Catskill Development, to build a $500 million casino on 30 acres at Monticello Raceway, about 90 miles northwest of New York City. Although casinos are illegal in New York, a federal law would permit gambling on sovereign Indian land.</p>
        <p>But eight days after gaining federal approval, the Mohawk tribal council spurned Catskill Development and signed a secret agreement with Arthur M. Goldberg, chief executive of Park Place Entertainment, the world's largest casino company. The tribe granted Park Place the rights to develop and manage tribal casinos in New York in return for a $3 million loan for the Mohawks' small, nearly bankrupt casino on the Canadian border. Former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Mr. Goldberg's adviser at the time who also knew the Mohawk chiefs, played an important role in securing the deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldberg then announced plans to build a huge casino-resort with the Mohawks at the old Kutsher's resort, about five miles away from the racetrack. Mr. Goldberg discovered, however, that he could not simply transfer the federal approval from the track to Kutsher's. Federal officials, flabbergasted by the turnabout, said it would take more than two years for a new application to wend its way through the approval process.</p>
        <p>It was a stunning move by a corporate executive who had been warning shareholders that a Catskill casino would cut into the profits of the company's gambling operations in Atlantic City. At least initially, local officials, as well as Senator Charles E. Schumer, regarded Mr. Goldberg as an interloper who secretly wanted to scuttle the project to protect his interests in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Furious about the last-minute sabotage, Robert A. Berman and the other partners in Catskill Development refused to meet with Mr. Goldberg, leaving one side with an approved site and the other with an approved tribe. In May, Gov. George E. Pataki, whose approval is needed for any Indian casino deal, said he would not make a decision on the Sullivan County proposal until the dust cleared.</p>
        <p>''Each side has something the other needs,'' Senator Schumer said. ''I'm trying to get both sides together. My goal is to bring gaming to this area, which needs it.''</p>
        <p>A third proposal surfaced recently about 10 miles south of Monticello in Mamakating, where a group has been quietly negotiating to build a casino-resort on a 720-acre parcel owned by Crescent Heights Investments, a development company. According to two people involved in the talks, Crescent Heights has been meeting with David Flaum, a developer from Rochester, and Len Wolman, managing partner of a gambling company owned in part by Sun International, about building a casino-resort with the Stockbridge-Munsee band of Mohicans. The tribal band, which is based in Wisconsin, has a 24,000-acre land claim in central New York.</p>
        <p>The proposal got a warm reception from officials in Mamakating, but the prospective partners hit a snag in mid-July. The three sides resumed negotiations recently but may work with a different tribe. One person involved in the project said MGM, another gambling company, had expressed interest in a casino.</p>
        <p>Still, the future of that proposal is cloudy. It is part of the continuing battle between Catskill Development and Park Place that has received the most attention in Sullivan County. Local political leaders say they now fear that the prospects for a casino are dimming. There will be a new president in Washington next year, and many of the pro-gambling officials at the Bureau of Indian Affairs are leaving the agency. Some politicians in Albany are also expected to resubmit a bill requiring legislative approval of any Indian casino, making any gambling project, proponents said, highly unlikely.</p>
        <p>In recent months, Mr. Goldberg has spent an enormous amount of time successfully convincing officials like Mr. Cellini, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Pomeroy that he truly intends to build a major resort. The profits he would make from a casino in the Catskills, he has said, would more than offset the loss of revenues in Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berman, in turn, met for months with leaders of the Cayuga tribe, which has a 64,000-acre land claim in central New York, about building a casino at the track. As they talked with John F. O'Mara, Mr. Pataki's chief negotiator on Indian land claims, the outline of a deal came together: The state would give the Cayugas $130 million to settle their land claims and allow the tribe to buy about 10,000 acres in their ancestral lands, according to documents that circulated among the three parties.</p>
        <p>The Pataki administration would also approve a Cayuga casino at Monticello Raceway, while the tribe agreed to revenue-sharing and to work out a tax arrangement. But shortly before the Cayugas went back to court in Syracuse on July 17 for their land claim, state officials suddenly broke off all contact. A jury had already awarded the tribe $37 million in damages and Judge Neal McCurn of Federal District Court is now determining whether to increase the award to as much as $1 billion.</p>
        <p>''The deal was done,'' said Martin Gold, a lawyer for the Cayugas, ''but it's nowhere now. The state walked away.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Mara did not return telephone calls requesting comment.</p>
        <p>''The state's inaction is disappointing,'' Mr. Berman said. ''It's a question of leadership; it requires the governor's intervention.''</p>
        <p>Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, said there had been discussions with a number of different Indian nations. ''Talks are ongoing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Goldberg has told local officials that he would be able to obtain federal approval within 11 months for a proposal to transfer land at the Kutsher's resort to the Mohawks for a $500 million to $750 million resort and casino on 66 acres, Mr. Cellini said. And Clive Cummis, general counsel for Park Place, said his company expected to file the application with the Interior Department and the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the next 45 days.</p>
        <p>But federal officials said it was unlikely that Park Place's application would be completed within a year. ''That's optimistic and not in keeping with our previous record on these matters,'' said Kevin Gover, the assistant secretary for Indian affairs at the Interior Department. ''Traditionally, it's taken two to three years on a new application.''</p>
        <p>The project could lose momentum during that time, so Mr. Schumer, Mr. Cellini and Mr. Goldberg have prevailed on Mr. Berman's group to sit down with Park Place officials to work out a deal for at least a temporary casino at the racetrack.</p>
        <p>''We're still hoping that the two parties can find a way to resolve their differences and move forward with a project at the Monticello Raceway,'' Mr. Pomeroy said.</p>
        <p>But Joseph Bernstein, a partner in Catskill Development, said that even if his group did agree to meet with Mr. Goldberg, they could not trust the man who he said had stolen their project. If they do not work out a deal with another tribe, he said, Catskill Development will sue Park Place.</p>
        <p>''They thought it was checkmate,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''Now, it's stalemate. The question now is: Who's the knight who's going to save the day?</p>
        <p>''Our case against Park Place is worth more than a casino. We either get the Cayugas or go to court. There's no way you can do a deal with a guy who stabbed you in the back.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cummis, who has known Mr. Bernstein for nearly 15 years, said he was surprised at the harsh words.</p>
        <p>''Any businessman dealing from a rational basis would want to sit down with someone on the other side to find out our position,'' Mr. Cummis said. ''Even the Arabs and the Israelis met.''</p>
