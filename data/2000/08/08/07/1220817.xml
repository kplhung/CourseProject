        <p>MAGIC TERROR  Seven Tales  By Peter Straub  335 pages. Random House. $24.95.</p>
        <p>In the clever exercises in horror that compose Peter Straub's latest work of fiction, ''Magic Terror: Seven Tales,'' the most successful is the brief ''Ashputtle,'' which takes its title from the German version of ''Cinderella.''</p>
        <p>Here the narrator is Mrs. Asch, ''the Mrs. being entirely honorific, no husband having ever been in evidence, nor ever likely to be.'' She is a psychopathic ''female kindergarten teacher in her 50's who happens to be very fat.'' She begins: ''People think that teaching little children has something to do with helping other people, something to do with service. People think that if you teach little children, you must love them. People get what they need from thoughts like this.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Asch sees herself as both the victim of a wicked stepmother and the wicked stepmother, too. During the course of her ramblings, she reveals that one of her students ''has been lost.'' She reports: ''A lost child lies deep within the ashes, her hands and feet mutilated, her face destroyed by fire. She has partaken of the great adventure, and now she is the same as all nature.'' She may or may not be aware that she herself is responsible for this loss, but the reader becomes aware, and the effect is chilling.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere Mr. Straub is often equally as adept but rarely as successful. In the much longer ''Bunny Is Good Bread,'' the psychopathic point of view is 5-year-old Fee Bandolier's as he watches his alcoholic father gradually battering his mother to death and is sexual molested by a man in a movie theater. Inevitably he becomes a serial murderer, joins the Army and is accepted for Special Forces training. But for all the skill of the narrative, the conclusion is announced instead of experienced, and you feel the author's elbow in your ribs.</p>
        <p>A similar tendentiousness mars ''Mr. Clubb and Mr. Cuff,'' a grotesque homage to Melville's ''Bartleby the Scrivener'' that won a 1999 Bram Stoker Award for Horror. Here a puritanical Wall Street tycoon who uses $10 words where nickel ones would do describes how he hired a Gallagher-and-Shean-type vaudeville team of ''private detectives extraordinaire'' to punish his wife for cheating on him with his business partner.</p>
        <p>The two detectives turn out to be sadistic torturers who move into the narrator's office and take over his life. But instead of infusing the story with the inevitable yet indefinable, as Bartleby's protest does, they merely teach the banal lesson that he who lives by the pickax and screwdriver dies by them.</p>
        <p>For fans of Mr. Straub's fiction (''Ghost Story,'' ''The Hellfire Club,'' ''Mr. X,'' among other novels of terror and the supernatural), there are many puzzles to work out in ''Magic Terror'': echoes of his earlier fiction, references to writers the author admires. ''The Ghost Village,'' a heavy-handed Conradian war story set in the battle jungles of Vietnam, reintroduces the characters who first appeared in the novel ''Koko.'' The sexual molestation in ''Bunny Is Good Bread'' develops a central incident in ''The Juniper Tree,'' one of the better stories in Mr. Straub's impressive earlier collection ''Houses Without Doors.''</p>
        <p>Yet whatever he may be up to with his echoes and leitmotifs, his main concern here seems to be narrative virtuosity. Repeatedly in ''Magic Terror,'' he clutches the reader by the collar. In ''Isn't It Romantic?'' a Bond-like operative identified only as N sets out on a mission in the French Pyrenees entailing good food, fast cars, esoteric trade talk and sexy women. In ''Porkpie Hat'' a jazz fan interviews a brilliant saxophonist he calls Hat (based on Lester Young) and induces him to tell a ghost story from his boyhood. ''Hunger, an Introduction'' seduces with the magniloquence of the autodidact.</p>
        <p>The trouble is, few of Mr. Straub's intended effects quite come off. The fate of smooth N is obvious almost from the beginning of ''Isn't It Romantic?'' ''The Ghost Village'' sends the not very fresh message that the violence of Vietnam came home to the States. The story within the story in ''Porkpie Hat'' is boring and obscure. ''Hunger, an Introduction'' ends on a lovely, lyric note without clear meaning.</p>
        <p>In the greatest of ghost stories, like ''The Beckoning Fair One,'' by Oliver Onions, or ''Silent Snow, Secret Snow,'' by Conrad Aiken, the narrative invades those recesses of your mind that you don't quite trust and makes the disintegration of something familiar seem irresistible. In ''Magic Terror'' Mr. Straub now and then entertains you. But his characters are mostly aliens, shadows on the face of the moon.</p>
