        <p>Richie Adubato acknowledged that the Liberty played the most forgettable of games tonight against the Miami Sol. Yet in the postgame glare of defeat, the coach felt the Women's National Basketball Association game could have been salvaged if not for an official's blown call.</p>
        <p>The Liberty was losing by 9 points at American Airlines Arena when guard Becky Hammon was dribbling in for a layup. Two Sol players appeared to make contact with her, but no foul was called. Adubato bolted onto the court to protest. Technical foul. Guard Teresa Weatherspoon also complained. Another technical foul.</p>

        <p>Richie Adubato acknowledged that the Liberty played the most forgettable of games tonight against the Miami Sol. Yet in the postgame glare of defeat, the coach felt the Women's National Basketball Association game could have been salvaged if not for an official's blown call.</p>
        <p>The Liberty was losing by 9 points at American Airlines Arena when guard Becky Hammon was dribbling in for a layup. Two Sol players appeared to make contact with her, but no foul was called. Adubato bolted onto the court to protest. Technical foul. Guard Teresa Weatherspoon also complained. Another technical foul.</p>
        <p>Two free throws by Kristen Rasmussen later and the Sol lead was at 11 en route to its 57-41 victory. It ended the Liberty's six-game winning streak and kept New York from clinching the Eastern Conference title.</p>
        <p>''Positively unbelievable,'' Adubato said. ''I don't know how you can miss that call. That could have made it a 6-point game, and with 13 minutes left, our players would have felt back in it.</p>
        <p>''When you're not playing well, you have to catch a break like that. That was such a key play.''</p>
        <p>Hammon said there was no question she was fouled on the play. ''I was hit all over the place,'' she said. ''It was obvious and blatant they were trying to foul me so I wouldn't get a 3-point play.''</p>
        <p>Center Tari Phillips saw the play unfold from midcourt, and it left her disgusted.</p>
        <p>''It was obvious to everyone in the arena that it was a foul,'' she said. ''Everybody saw how hard she got hit. It was the turning point in the game.''</p>
        <p>Adubato was also upset about two fouls called on his players tonight for jump ball infractions.</p>
        <p>''Against Phoenix they did the same thing to us nine times and there was not a single foul called,'' the coach said. ''I want to know where the consistency is.''</p>
        <p>A moment later Adubato was acknowledging that the Liberty (19-11) did not really play well enough to win. It allowed 20 offensive rebounds, had 18 turnovers, shot 33.3 percent from the field and was outscored, 24-6, from the foul line.</p>
        <p>''This was just a bad game for us,'' he said. ''But I'll say it again: we still had a chance to win it.''</p>
        <p>Now, the Liberty has an important game on Tuesday against second-place Cleveland, which is two games behind the first-place Liberty with two to play.</p>
        <p>Not much good came from tonight's game. Weatherspoon, one of just three players to start every one of their teams' games since the league began in 1997, played despite a broken nose incurred in Friday's triumph over Orlando. That was the best news the Liberty received on this night.</p>
        <p>Miami, an expansion team out of playoff contention, set the game's tone by dominating the first half. It scored 18 of the half's final 22 points to take a 32-20 advantage into intermission.</p>
        <p>Hammon's 3-point play midway through the first gave the Liberty a 16-14 edge, but then the team's defense began to collapse.</p>
        <p>Hammon was whistled for a flagrant foul, giving Marlies Askamp two free throws and the Sol possession of the ball.</p>
        <p>That wound up costing the Liberty 4 points as Askamp made the free throws and the Sol used its gift possession for Kisha Ford's short jump shot.</p>
        <p>Then things got worse.</p>
        <p>The Liberty was held without a field goal for the next nine minutes. Only Phillips's layup with a second left in the half broke that drought.</p>
        <p>The Liberty, which had beaten Miami in earlier meetings this season, by 58-52 and 63-51, tried passionately to make a game of it in the second half.</p>
        <p>Though their shots mostly did not find the net, Adubato's players kept battling. In one sequence, Weatherspoon, sans face mask, chased a missed shot toward the sideline. She wound up diving into a row of press seats, and never mind the broken nose.</p>
        <p>The rim simply seemed to get smaller for the Liberty as the clock ticked down. And eventually, the game slipped away.</p>
