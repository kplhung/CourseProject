        <p>Virtually all the stars of American bridge and a handful from the rest of the world will compete in the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals in Anaheim, Calif., starting Friday. Some will be there early because they have qualified for the playoffs in the Grand National Teams, which start Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The New York representatives are Jeff Aker, Brady Richter, Barry Rigal, John Solodar, Sue Picus and Alex Ornstein. Thanks in part to the diagramed deal, they scored an upset victory in the local final in May against a squad that included Zia Mahmood and David Berkowitz.</p>

        <p>Virtually all the stars of American bridge and a handful from the rest of the world will compete in the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals in Anaheim, Calif., starting Friday. Some will be there early because they have qualified for the playoffs in the Grand National Teams, which start Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The New York representatives are Jeff Aker, Brady Richter, Barry Rigal, John Solodar, Sue Picus and Alex Ornstein. Thanks in part to the diagramed deal, they scored an upset victory in the local final in May against a squad that included Zia Mahmood and David Berkowitz.</p>
        <p>At both tables, four hearts was reached as shown. East's weak-two bid in diamonds was a maximum, and some would bid one diamond or even three diamonds. North's cue-bid of three diamonds was a strong invitation to four hearts, suggesting that his original pass concealed maximum values.</p>
        <p>Diamonds were led and continued, and South was forced to ruff the third round with the heart queen. Now he had lost two tricks and was hoping for an even trump split. As the cards lay, though, he was, one would think, due to lose a spade trick and a trump trick for down one.</p>
        <p>When Ornstein was declarer, he made a good attempt to steal the contract by leading a low spade at the fourth trick. He was sure the ace was on his left and hoped for a normal second-hand-low play. West, who did not know that his trumps were due to take a trick, obliged by playing low, and South seized his opportunity.</p>
        <p>He won with the spade queen, led to the heart king and cashed the king-queen of clubs. Next he crossed to the heart ace and threw a spade on the club ace. When East's jack dropped conveniently, Ornstein could throw his last spade on the club 10. West's spade ace withered on the vine, and the game was made.</p>
        <p>In the replay, Aker as West was faced with the same problem at the fourth trick when a spade was led. He knew that his partner could have very little outside the diamond suit, since he had not opened with one diamond. If East did not hold the spade jack, there was no advantage for West in playing low. If East did hold the spade jack, he could not hold the club king or queen, in which case the clubs would provide a discard for a possible spade loser in the South hand.</p>
        <p>So Aker decided that there was no advantage in playing low on the spade lead. He hopped up with his ace, praying that his partner held the singleton heart jack, a card that would promote the 10 as a sure trick. Richter, East, had the vital honor card, the contract failed, and Aker's team gained 10 imps, nearly half the margin of the eventual 22-imp victory.</p>
        <p>The bridge column on Saturday, about a six-heart contract that was defeated by good defense, misstated the side suit in which South could expect to lose a trick. The declarer could expect to lose a diamond trick and a trump trick, not a club and a trump.</p>
