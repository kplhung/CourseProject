        <p>Matt Mantei remembers how exhausted he felt when he took the mound at Shea Stadium in the 10th inning last Oct. 9. As the Arizona Diamondbacks' closer, Mantei was used to short outings, and he was into his third inning of work when the Mets' Todd Pratt came to the plate leading off.</p>
        <p>''I was a little winded, just trying to get through,'' Mantei said. ''But it didn't happen. It didn't take me too long to get over it. I'm a grown man, I could handle it. Hopefully, we can get a shot at it again this year.''</p>

        <p>Matt Mantei remembers how exhausted he felt when he took the mound at Shea Stadium in the 10th inning last Oct. 9. As the Arizona Diamondbacks' closer, Mantei was used to short outings, and he was into his third inning of work when the Mets' Todd Pratt came to the plate leading off.</p>
        <p>''I was a little winded, just trying to get through,'' Mantei said. ''But it didn't happen. It didn't take me too long to get over it. I'm a grown man, I could handle it. Hopefully, we can get a shot at it again this year.''</p>
        <p>Today was the Diamondbacks' sixth shot at the Mets since Pratt homered off Mantei to win that playoff game and the division series last fall. The Mets had won each of the previous five meetings.</p>
        <p>When Mantei entered today's game, the Mets had scored two runs in the ninth inning, helped by Jay Payton's fourth single. The potential tying run was on deck -- and it was in the form of Pratt, in the lineup for Mike Piazza, who has a sprained left knee. But Mantei averted a rematch. Pumping fastballs to a breaking-ball hitter, he struck out Matt Franco to save a 9-5 victory for the Diamondbacks.</p>
        <p>For the Mets, the loss ended a four-game winning streak and was just their second in 12 games, a stretch that has propelled them to the second-best record in the National League and a three-game advantage in the National League wild-card race.</p>
        <p>''There's not a thing I don't like about the Mets,'' Mantei said. ''I like the way they play, I like the way they hustle. They play hard. Just to get a win and get an edge on them a little bit is nice.''</p>
        <p>The Mets left-hander Glendon Rusch was facing the Diamondbacks for the first time, and he turned in his shortest start of the year, lasting four innings and giving up five runs, seven hits and two walks.</p>
        <p>Rusch threw 84 pitches, but only two of them really hurt. The first, to Matt Williams, was called ''flat-out bad'' by Mets Manager Bobby Valentine, who called the second one, to Tony Womack, ''a little sloppy.'' Pratt, the Mets' catcher in place of Piazza, who will miss three to five days, simply called both pitches ''horrible.''</p>
        <p>Rusch (7-9) was not about to argue. The score was tied, 1-1, with two outs and one on in the third when Williams came to bat. Before today, Rusch and Williams had not faced each other since 1997, and Williams was 0 for 7 off Rusch in his career.</p>
        <p>''He's got a smooth motion, and the ball gets on you pretty quick,'' Williams said. ''He throws an 88, 89-mile-per-hour fastball, but it looks like it's 93 or 94.''</p>
        <p>This time, Rusch tried to come inside on Williams with an 0-1 fastball. Instead, he left the pitch up and over the middle, and Williams clubbed it into the left-field bleachers for a two-run homer, just his fourth in a season that began late because of a broken right foot and a strained right quadriceps.</p>
        <p>It was ''just a flat-out bad pitch to Williams,'' Valentine said, ''and Matt deposited it like a good hitter should.''</p>
        <p>Still, that pitch did not bother Rusch as much as the one he made to Womack the next inning. With one out and a runner on, Danny Bautista, the eighth-place hitter, singled on a pitch so low that Pratt was on his knees trying to block it. ''It was like a cricket hit,'' Pratt said. Pitcher Armando Reynoso sacrificed the runners for the second out, and Rusch got ahead of Womack, 1-2.</p>
        <p>Rusch sometimes drops to a sidearm delivery against left-handers to vary his look, and he did so on this pitch. But where he threw it mattered more to Rusch than how. The pitch hung high in the strike zone, and Womack lined it up the middle. Two runs scored and the Diamondbacks had turned a 3-1 advantage into a 5-1 lead. Rusch knew it was crushing.</p>
        <p>''In a lot of games, one pitch is going to make or break the ballgame,'' he said. ''You need to identify that point in the game and make quality pitches there. If you don't, it could cost you the ballgame.''</p>
        <p>Pratt, who has caught 10 of Rusch's 20 starts, said Rusch could easily be 10-5 this year if he had been luckier early in the season. Today's loss was not due to bad luck, though the Diamondbacks capitalized both times Rusch made a mistake.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you make mistakes, and as a viewer of the game, you don't know that they're mistakes because they get fouled off,'' Pratt said. ''Today, they didn't get fouled off.''</p>
        <p>The Mets had chances off Reynoso, especially in the third inning, when they loaded the bases with one out for Robin Ventura. But there were no bases-loaded dramatics this time: Ventura bounced what should have been an inning-ending double-play ball to first. Greg Colbrunn bobbled it and could get only one out, allowing a run to score, but the Mets left two runners on when Benny Agbayani flied out.</p>
        <p>A two-run homer by Mike Bordick in the seventh chased Reynoso (8-7) from the game, but the right-hander picked up his third victory against the Mets since leaving them as a free agent after the 1998 season. He worked six and a third innings and gave up three runs, seven hits and three walks.</p>
        <p>Home runs by Bautista and Colbrunn made Arizona's advantage stand and gave Mantei a comfortable lead when he fanned Franco to end the game.</p>
        <p>If Mantei felt there was any significance to Pratt being left in the on-deck circle, he did not say so.</p>
        <p>''I've forgotten the home run,'' he said. ''I just remember the team that beat us.</p>
        <p>''They didn't beat me, they beat our team. You always remember that.''</p>
