        <p>The Malian guitarist, singer and bandleader Ali Farka Toure announced his retirement at his concert at Town Hall on Friday night. Speaking in French, he said that he was 61 years old and that it was time for a younger generation of musicians to be heard. If it was a farewell concert, then he went out rocking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toure, who has toured Europe and the United States, spent most of the previous decade as a farmer in the town of Niafunke, near Timbuktu. His producers had to come to him to make his most recent album, ''Niafunke'' (Hannibal/Rykodisc). Yet his retirement plans have nothing to do with reclusiveness or waning technique. Onstage he radiated joy, showmanship and the kind of irreverence that's earned through complete artistic mastery. He thoroughly understands both the Malian traditions he carries and exactly how he intends to transmute them.</p>

        <p>The Malian guitarist, singer and bandleader Ali Farka Toure announced his retirement at his concert at Town Hall on Friday night. Speaking in French, he said that he was 61 years old and that it was time for a younger generation of musicians to be heard. If it was a farewell concert, then he went out rocking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toure, who has toured Europe and the United States, spent most of the previous decade as a farmer in the town of Niafunke, near Timbuktu. His producers had to come to him to make his most recent album, ''Niafunke'' (Hannibal/Rykodisc). Yet his retirement plans have nothing to do with reclusiveness or waning technique. Onstage he radiated joy, showmanship and the kind of irreverence that's earned through complete artistic mastery. He thoroughly understands both the Malian traditions he carries and exactly how he intends to transmute them.</p>
        <p>He draws on music and words from many of Mali's old tribes, singing in Songhai, Peul, Bambara and other languages. The music is a weave of riffs and polyrhythms that were probably once plucked on harps and tapped on marimbas; only a few songs use chords instead of single notes. Mr. Toure started most tunes alone, picking runs and trills that defied any steady beat, then cued the band: electric bass, congas, djembe (hand drum), calabash (played with sticks) and two singers with coordinated dance steps. Songs that sound like meditations on his studio recordings had a new kick onstage; with any luck, he'll make a live album.</p>
        <p>The prickly, syncopated, one-chord patterns in Malian music are kin to the one-chord modal blues of American musicians like John Lee Hooker, and Mr. Toure knows it. Sometimes he shifted the Malian rhythms, which often subdivide into triplets, toward the slow lope of a blues shuffle; sometimes he brought blues inflections and bent notes to his voice and guitar.</p>
        <p>One song even had stop-time passages, like a Chicago blues band. But where blues songs take up private feelings in surges of tension and release, the Malian songs are proverbs and admonitions to the community, delivered as thoughtful incantations or call-and-response with the group. In ''Hilly Yoro,'' Mr. Toure instructed: ''Everyone should follow their own route/If a man has no eyes another can see.'' Mr. Toure also sang about young soldiers fighting a war they didn't understand, about the power of trust and about a workingman's love.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toure set up the patterns precisely and sang in a kindly but unswerving voice. Then his electric guitar jumped into the foreground. With a tone that had nearly enough reverb for surf music, Mr. Toure would bend a note toward discordance, jab against the beat or soar into a glissando, heeding the pattern only to disrupt it at will. He was a modern individualist shaking up a tradition yet not leaving it behind.</p>
        <p>At one point he said he was a self-taught musician, then introduced ''my real master'': he pulled a njarka, a one-stringed fiddle, out of a bag. On it he played a fierce Malian hoedown, in an African tonality that had nothing to do with the West.</p>
        <p>Afel Bocoum, who opened the concert, has worked with Mr. Toure for 30 years. His own band, Alkibar, was like a backwoods Mississippi band opening for a polished urban soul revue: less flashy and dynamic, but richly hypnotic. Mr. Bocoum played acoustic guitar, and Alkibar included a backup singer and musicians on calabash, njarka, njurkle (small one-stringed guitar) and electric bass. Above the clicking triplets of the calabash, Mr. Bocoum praised friendship, condemned materialism and warned about forest destruction and desertification. The complex modal patterns circled again and again, carrying both the lessons in the songs and the spirit of age-old traditions.</p>
