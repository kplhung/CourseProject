        <p>With just hours to go until his self-imposed deadline of noon on Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore huddled with close aides and family members tonight to make his decision on a vice presidential running mate.</p>
        <p>Speculation continued to center on four Democrats in the Senate -- John Kerry of Massachusetts, John Edwards of North Carolina, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Evan Bayh of Indiana -- although Mr. Gore raised the possibility last week that he might pick a ''wild card.''</p>
        <p>The vice president met here this afternoon with Warren Christopher, the head of his vice presidential search committee, to discuss his choices. Also in the meeting were Mr. Gore's brother-in-law, Frank Hunger; Bill Daley, his campaign chairman, and Donna Brazile, his campaign manager.</p>
        <p>At every opportunity today, Mr. Gore said he had not made a decision. ''I have not decided yet,'' he said at a fund-raiser in New York this afternoon. ''But I will, and shortly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley appeared on several talk shows this morning, determined not to tip Mr. Gore's hand. But he did discuss how the campaign might respond to concerns that have been raised about each of the possible candidates.</p>
        <p>Asked whether Mr. Edwards's tenure of just a year and a half in the Senate showed sufficient experience, Mr. Daley noted on CNN's ''Late Edition'' that Abraham Lincoln had served only one term in Congress before he became president.</p>
        <p>Of Mr. Kerry, whom some Republicans have branded a Massachusetts liberal in the Kennedy tradition, Mr. Daley said he was a patriot and decorated Vietnam veteran.</p>
        <p>Of criticism from abortion-rights groups that Mr. Bayh was not committed enough to abortion rights, Mr. Daley said that Mr. Bayh's record as a former governor of Indiana showed his leadership, and that his position on abortion would not disqualify him from consideration.</p>
        <p>Asked if the country was ready for a Jewish president -- referring to Mr. Lieberman -- Mr. Daley acknowledged that some people might have a problem with that, but he noted that several states in addition to Connecticut have elected Jewish senators.</p>
        <p>Ed Rendell, chairman of the Democratic Party, told reporters on Saturday, ''I don't think anyone can calculate the effect of having a Jew on the ticket.'' Mr. Rendell is Jewish, but his comments drew criticism today from Jewish groups.</p>
        <p>Nathan Diament, political director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, said that Mr. Rendell was giving legitimacy to ''whatever anti-Semitic views are out there.'' Mr. Diament said he was worried that commentary on Mr. Lieberman, whose Orthodox faith precludes certain activities on Saturdays, was ''feeding a perception that Sabbath-observant people aren't capable of doing certain jobs.''</p>
        <p>Today, speculation centered as much on when the selection might be leaked to the news media as it did on who the candidate might be.</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman, said, ''There is no firm timetable, but it's unlikely that any phone calls will take place until later on on Monday or early Tuesday.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehane said that the process was being run in the manner that Mr. Gore had insisted on. ''We haven't engaged in soliciting Democrats by sending out questionnaires, we haven't held a series of press conferences with possible candidates, and you haven't had a range of names put out there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christopher said this afternoon that he thought Mr. Gore had conducted his search in ''a professional manner.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has not brought up any names publicly, but officials close to the campaign have confirmed a list of six. Besides the four senators, the list included Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, both of whom have said they are not interested.</p>
        <p>The question of whom Mr. Gore may pick for his running mate has dominated political talk here and wherever Mr. Gore has appeared over the weekend. When he arrived in Nashville from New York this afternoon, his hotel was swamped with camera crews and reporters, and Mr. Gore tried to turn the focus of attention from speculation on his running mate to his campaign themes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore began the day at a church service in Sag Harbor, N.Y., on the east end of Long Island. He had asked to speak to honor the 35th anniversary of the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which gave the federal government the authority to oversee voter registration and elections in counties that had used literacy tests and other unconstitutional means to determine voter eligibility.</p>
        <p>The occasion allowed Mr. Gore to reflect on his, and his father's, support for civil rights although, as a United States senator from Tennessee, his father, Albert Gore Sr., voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
        <p>The occasion allowed Mr. Gore to showcase more of his personal biography, a goal that is becoming more urgent for Mr. Gore as he heads toward the Democratic National Convention next week in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>He used that spotlight over the weekend to appeal to the base of his party, including blacks and liberals.</p>
        <p>Speaking today from the pulpit of Christ Episcopal Church, Mr. Gore said that the congregation of about 70 people, who included several African-Americans, ''looks like America.''</p>
