        <p>Stephen Riggio remembers telling executives at Barnes &amp; Noble that the Internet was the future of bookselling in 1994, before Amazon.com had even begun. But he has never gotten much credit for it. By the time he founded Barnesandnoble.com, in 1997, Barnes &amp; Noble had become watchwords for letting an Internet upstart eat your lunch.</p>
        <p>Last week should have been heartening. Amazon.com lost its president, missed its revenue projections and saw its stock plummet amid doubts about its ability to branch into new markets. One Lehman Brothers analyst even questioned how long the company would be able to pay its bills.</p>
        <p>But Barnesandnoble.com suffered, too. The company reported a wider-than-expected loss and missed its projected revenue by more than 10 percent, a sign to some analysts of a growing saturation of demand for books from people already online. Investors sent its stock tumbling more than 25 percent to close on Friday at $3.75 a share, down from a 52-week high last fall of $23.50 a share.</p>
        <p>This week should come as a welcome relief from the bad news for Mr. Riggio, who is acting chief executive of the online spinoff and brother to Leonard Riggio, chief executive of Barnes &amp; Noble. He will enjoy a novel role reversal. Now is his turn to play the new media visionary.</p>
        <p>Barnesandnoble.com is teaming up with Microsoft to open tomorrow the first major online store selling digital books, available for downloading and reading on a screen or in single paperback copies printed on demand on high-speed presses -- technological capacities that Amazon.com does not yet have.</p>
        <p>The opening is a pivotal event for the company and a bellwether for the industry. Although many consider the idea of reading on a screen awkward and far-fetched, some publishers hope that electronic books will provide a new avenue of growth in an otherwise nearly flat business, just as first paperbacks and then audio books did in the past. As the first major outlet for digital books, the new store will assay the depth of consumer demand, the prices readers are willing to pay and the danger of piracy and hacking. For Barnesandnoble.com, analysts say, selling digital books could some day hold out the potential for new, more profitable sales within the company's traditional franchise -- books.</p>
        <p>Partly for that reason, Mr. Riggio has been pushing the e-book idea for years, according to current and former employees. One of Mr. Riggio's first directives when he resumed Barnesandnoble.com's day-to-day management in January, long before the idea took off with publishers, was to install a tab for electronic books on its home page.</p>
        <p>The digital-book store is a big bet for a small company, considering that no one yet knows the size of the potential demand. To build its presence in the digital book market, Barnesandnoble.com invested $20 million in MightyWords, which publishes short digital books. The company spent undisclosed millions more on technology for downloading electronic books, providing storage space and processing payments.</p>
        <p>For its part, Microsoft will introduce tomorrow the latest version of its free software for reading on screens. The new edition is easier to use than its predecessors and is available for desktops and laptops as well as expensive hand-held devices. Microsoft executives say that no skeleton-key code-breaker will be able to open all of the electronic books available for its software, but no single electronic book is fully hacker-proof.</p>
        <p>The joint debut offers Barnesandnoble.com a chance to benefit from Microsoft's formidable marketing strength. Microsoft is backing the new venture with a sizable campaign, and in the process promoting Barnesandnoble.com. In an unusual boon to authors and publishers accustomed to begging for attention, Microsoft is actually paying some of them for the right to advertise their books with its software. Microsoft, in turn, hopes to make its money in the form of a small commission on each sale of a digital book for its software.</p>
        <p>Barnesandnoble.com and Microsoft did not disclose the terms of their agreement. Microsoft expects to work with other Web sites. Barnesandnoble.com also sells electronic books for other formats.</p>
        <p>The site will begin with more than 2,000 digital titles available in the Microsoft format, adding about 150 new titles a week. In addition to selling electronic books, Barnesandnoble.com hopes to use them to keep its customers coming back, another area where the company has lagged behind Amazon.com. The company will offer virtual shelf space to customers by investing in computer servers that will store shoppers' digital books online. Customers can download the same title to the same one or two computers as often as they like, easing the need to store the electronic texts on their hard drives.</p>
        <p>The digital-book store also sets the stage for a new battle with publishers. Mr. Riggio said the company planned to expand Barnes &amp; Noble's long-standing publishing program into digital books. ''Publishers really add very little value to the distribution of book content,'' he said. ''They are not terribly good at physical book distribution, and they are not very good at technology. They will have a place in the digital world, but smaller than it is today.''</p>
        <p>Barnes &amp; Noble, which holds a large stake in the online unit, previously published its own editions of books in the public domain, like ''Leaves of Grass'' or ''Middlemarch.'' But now Barnesandnoble.com has hired a respected former illustrated book publisher, Michael Fragnito, who has begun meeting with agents to discuss buying the digital rights to previously published works still under copyright.</p>
        <p>That puts Barnesandnoble.com into direct competition with traditional publishers, its major suppliers, who are themselves now scrambling to acquire the digital rights to their authors' back lists. As Chris MacAskill, MightyWords' chief executive, discovered when he published some authors' short essays, traditional publishers can be very territorial. ''Publishers get very, very jumpy about digital rights,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Riggio says the digital rights originally belong to the author, not the publisher. ''We strongly believe that the author is entitled to a very big share of the savings that result from the distribution of digital content,'' he said. What royalty rate Barnesandnoble.com will offer for digital rights to previously published titles remains to be set, he said.</p>
        <p>He maintains that, in time, Barnesandnoble.com will flourish in the online world in part because most of its products -- books, videos and music -- can be delivered over the Internet. To promote its products, he says, the site is already becoming an online broadcaster. Barnesandnoble.com began a network for 16 online radio stations, soon expanding to 120. It is testing online video programming about authors and books, BNTV.</p>
        <p>In the short term, some analysts say Barnesandnoble.com's most promising innovation may be more low-technology delivery techniques, particularly its same-day delivery program. In Manhattan, any order before 11 a.m. is delivered by 7 p.m., at no extra charge, by a fleet of Barnesandnoble.com trucks and messengers. Mr. Riggio says the company is evaluating similar services in other cities. Barnesandnoble.com also lets people return online purchases at Barnes &amp; Noble stores. (Until recently, it was even possible to receive a refund greater than the online price.)</p>
        <p>But, although most analysts support Barnesandnoble.com's investment in electronic books on the chance of a payoff years ahead, few expect it to help the company's sagging stock price any time soon.</p>
        <p>Spurred by the low share price, rumors have spread through the industry that Bertelsmann was seeking to buy the online bookstore outright. Bertelsmann and Barnes &amp; Noble each own 40 percent of Barnesandnoble.com. Flush with cash from selling a stake in America Online, Bertelsmann has been buying up struggling Internet retailers to build an Internet commerce empire under its own brand. Bertelsmann executives have pointedly declined to comment on the question.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riggio, too, declined to comment on any talks, except to say that ''we talk to them about all kinds of things.'' Both Barnes &amp; Noble and Bertelsmann are ''committed to the business,'' he said. The online store expects to begin making a profit in 2002, and analysts say its profits could help Barnes &amp; Noble bolster its own sagging shares. In the meantime, Mr. Riggio says, Barnesandnoble.com has over $350 million in cash and no debt -- plenty of capital to stay in business till the company turns a profit.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Riggio has a long way to go to restore Wall Street's faith in the company. For one thing, some say that, after more than doubling from one year to the next, the days of explosive growth in online bookselling in the United States are over. People already online seem to be buying as many books via the Internet as they will, said Mark Rowen, analyst at Prudential Securities. As a result, he says, growth in the online book market is slowing significantly, to about the rate that new consumers hook up to the Internet or a little faster -- about 20 percent to 30 percent a year, he said.</p>
        <p>Anthony Noto, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said Barnesandnoble.com faced an uphill battle because it was locked into marketing agreements with other companies like Internet access providers, limiting its ability to cut costs when revenue growth slows. Worse, he said, Barnesandnoble.com thus far has failed to take advantage of Barnes &amp; Noble's 544 retail stores to win new customers.</p>
        <p>''You expect their customer acquisition costs to be lower than pure Internet companies, and, the bottom line is, they still are higher than Amazon's,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem, Mr. Noto said, is motivational. The online store threatens to steal sales from the retail stores, and, except for the Riggios, Barnes &amp; Noble executives have little incentive to pull for the online spinoff. Others blame a lack of stable management. Mr. Riggio assumed the title of acting chief executive seven months ago, and the company still has no replacement.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Riggio said that the analysts were ''very wrong.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know the analyst who has been inside the company or met with its management,'' he said, calling his management team ''one of the most stable in the sector.''</p>
        <p>Cooperation between the chain and the online store, he insisted, was coming along fine. He declined to name specifics but promised ''exciting things in the next six months.''</p>
        <p>He predicted the company's marketing costs would decline, too. Heavy spending to advertise in print, radio and television is ''behind us now,'' he said, and the company could use its access to Barnes &amp; Noble stores to strike advantageous marketing deals, such as its current agreement with America Online. ''We'll be around in 10 years, or 20 years. People are more motivated to work with us now than with companies in the Wild West shootout that had been the Internet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As for hiring a new chief executive, Mr. Riggio said, his day-to-day management ensured continuity, enabling the board to take its time. ''I am among the candidates being considered,'' he said.</p>
