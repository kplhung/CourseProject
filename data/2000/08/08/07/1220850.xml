        <p>It said so right there in the past-performance charts: Lemon Drop Kid did not like running around a wet track. Through a dreary week of rain, his trainer, Scotty Schulhofer, worried that Saratoga Race Course would come up spongy on Whitney day. When the showers began to fall an hour before the race today, Schulhofer thought he was cursed.</p>
        <p>But the horse he has called the best he has ever trained skimmed over the surface as if he were fitted with water skis. Lemon Drop Kid's two-length victory in 1 minute 48.1 seconds in the Grade I race showed -- at least for now -- that he was the best older horse in the handicap division.</p>

        <p>It said so right there in the past-performance charts: Lemon Drop Kid did not like running around a wet track. Through a dreary week of rain, his trainer, Scotty Schulhofer, worried that Saratoga Race Course would come up spongy on Whitney day. When the showers began to fall an hour before the race today, Schulhofer thought he was cursed.</p>
        <p>But the horse he has called the best he has ever trained skimmed over the surface as if he were fitted with water skis. Lemon Drop Kid's two-length victory in 1 minute 48.1 seconds in the Grade I race showed -- at least for now -- that he was the best older horse in the handicap division.</p>
        <p>''I was very concerned that it would get sloppier,'' Schulhofer said. ''It was just wet enough.''</p>
        <p>It was the third victory in a row for Lemon Drop Kid, and it rewarded Schulhofer and his owner, Jeanne Vance, handsomely for their belief in a horse that has often been overlooked. The winner's share for the victory was $680,000 and was supplemented by a $230,000 bonus for capturing the National Thoroughbred Racing Association's champions bonus, a series of races for older horses that was televised on Fox over the past seven months.</p>
        <p>In the winner's circle afterward, as Schulhofer was losing a wrestling match with an umbrella, his rival trainer D. Wayne Lukas chided him good-naturedly: ''Don't worry about the umbrella, Scotty. You can afford a new suit.''</p>
        <p>Lemon Drop Kid, a 4-year-old son of Kingmambo, made his purse look like easy money as he stalked David, Cat Thief and Golden Missile, who had compiled the most formidable recent numbers coming into this mile-and-an-eighth event. Edgar Prado, Lemon Drop Kid's jockey, let those three run in front for three-quarters of a mile before angling wide around them coming out of the turn.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, the horse that Prado had to collar was the Lukas-trained Cat Thief, who has not won since the Breeders' Cup Classic nine races ago and was sent off at odds of 9-1.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't sure if I would get another chance to move again,'' Prado said of how he decided to turn on the jets. ''He dug in real game when Cat Thief came again.''</p>
        <p>For 30 yards or so, it looked as if Cat Thief's new rider, Jorge Chavez, might break his horse's losing streak as he banged shoulder to shoulder with Lemon Drop Kid in the stretch. ''He was giving me everything, but the other horse was stepping quicker and easier,'' Chavez said.</p>
        <p>Both Cat Thief and Chavez fared better than Behrens, the prerace second choice, who clipped heels with Golden Missile at the start, stumbled and splashed home a well-beaten third. In a bit of a turnabout, the trainer James Bond had replaced Chavez with Jerry Bailey even though Chavez had ridden Behrens in his last 14 races, 5 of them victories.</p>
        <p>''He was in contention, but never really fired,'' Bond said. ''I've had better days.''</p>
        <p>Despite now winning a Grade I stakes in each year of his career -- including the Belmont and Travers Stakes last summer -- Lemon Drop Kid has failed to stir devotion among horse enthusiasts. He was sent off as the lukewarm favorite at 2-1. But Schulhofer always believed. Three races ago, he replaced Jose Santos with Prado. Two races ago, he adding blinkers to Lemon Drop Kid to focus the colt, especially when he was turning for home</p>
        <p>''It looks to me like he's still improving,'' said Schulhofer, a Hall of Fame trainer who is pointing the colt toward the Breeders' Cup Classic in November at Churchill Downs and a run at the championship. ''It looks like he's at the top of his game, and all we have to do is keep him healthy and strong.</p>
        <p>''There's a month to the Woodward, then a month to the Jockey Club Gold Cup and three weeks to the Breeders' Cup. I don't think it will be too much for him. He's finally found out what racing is all about. He was just playing around before we put Edgar and blinkers on him. He's finally running the way I knew he could.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>The following marks were set at Saratoga Race Course over the weekend: highest non-Travers day on-track handle: $5,185,404.55 (previous mark: $5,088,819 on Aug. 14, 1993); largest weekend total commingled handle: $43,594,840 (previous mark: $42,384,018 on Travers weekend, 1999); largest weekend on-track attendance: 109,252 (previous record: 93,004 on the third weekend of 1999).</p>
