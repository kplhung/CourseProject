        <p>In retrospect, said the trainer Richard Mandella, perhaps he should have made a bigger deal over the injury Dixie Union sustained during last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile, in which he finished fifth to Anees after chipping a bone in his knee.</p>
        <p>''He was a very good 2-year-old; I thought he was the best 2-year-old last year,'' said Mandella, wondering whether his reticence to trumpet the injury cost the multiple stakes-winning colt consideration for year-end honors.</p>

        <p>In retrospect, said the trainer Richard Mandella, perhaps he should have made a bigger deal over the injury Dixie Union sustained during last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile, in which he finished fifth to Anees after chipping a bone in his knee.</p>
        <p>''He was a very good 2-year-old; I thought he was the best 2-year-old last year,'' said Mandella, wondering whether his reticence to trumpet the injury cost the multiple stakes-winning colt consideration for year-end honors.</p>
        <p>Surgery, and subsequent bad weather in California, kept Dixie Union out of the Triple Crown races and out of the spotlight, at least until today.</p>
        <p>Before a record crowd of 41,630 at Monmouth Park, Dixie Union charged past the favored Captain Steve and into the 3-year-old picture with a three-quarter-length victory in the $1 million Haskell Invitational.</p>
        <p>''He's just working his way back,'' Mandella said of Dixie Union, a dark bay son of Dixieland Band who won an allowance in his first race back this year, on May 7, and then finished second in two stakes at Hollywood Park. ''He looked good winning his first, then got beat in a sprint. To be honest, I was disappointed when he lost his last, but we were giving 11 pounds to a good horse.'' He was referring to his trip in the Affirmed Handicap, which was won by Tiznow.</p>
        <p>In the Haskell, Dixie Union carried 117 pounds, 5 fewer than top-weighted Commendable, the Belmont winner, who finished second to last, and five more than the long shot Mercaldo, who was seventh in the field of nine. But it was the one-and-an-eighth-mile distance, more than the weight, that was a question. Dixie Union had never won at more than a mile. He also had not won outside California, or in a Grade I race, as had Captain Steve and Commendable.</p>
        <p>But he satisfactorily answered whatever questions anyone might have had in the Grade I Haskell. With Thistyranthasclass going straight to the lead, closely followed by Captain Steve and More Than Ready, the jockey Alex Solis settled Dixie Union in fifth on the outside. Rounding the clubhouse turn, More Than Ready, in tight quarters on the inside, had to steady, and Solis was forced to check Dixie Union in the ensuing traffic.</p>
        <p>''Luckily, he's very athletic,'' Solis said. ''I got him back in the race and was patient from there on.''</p>
        <p>Thistyranthasclass, a New Jersey bred who had won four straight at Monmouth, held on to the lead at the top of the stretch, reluctantly giving way when Corey Nakatani gunned Captain Steve to the front. At the same time, Solis was easing Dixie Union to the far outside. As the leaders slowed through the final furlong, he was able to power into the lead a few jumps from the wire, pulling off to a three-quarter-length victory over Captain Steve in 1:50.</p>
        <p>''Dixie Union was the horse I feared most,'' said Bob Baffert, who trains Captain Steve.</p>
        <p>Milwaukee Brew made a late move on the inside to finish a head back in third; More Than Ready was two lengths back in fourth.</p>
        <p>''I thought he ran great,'' said Todd Pletcher, trainer of More Than Ready. ''He ran hard, and you can't take anything away from him. This was just the way it fell.''</p>
        <p>Following More Than Ready under the wire were Thistyranthasclass, Impeachment, Mercaldo, Commendable and Kiss a Native.</p>
        <p>Dixie Union, who earned $600,000 for his owners, Gerald J. Ford and Herman Sarkowsky, returned $11.40 for a $2 bet to win as he extended his career record to 6 victories in 10 starts with three seconds.</p>
        <p>''This race is special, and it's special for Dixie Union,'' Solis said. ''Ever since I first got on him to work him as a 2-year-old, I loved him. He hasn't been able to show what he is capable of, and today he did.''</p>
        <p>Mandella said the Travers Stakes at Saratoga on Aug. 26 could be the colt's next start depending on how he comes out of the Haskell.</p>
        <p>Among those he could face are Graeme Hall, winner of Saturday's Jim Dandy; the Preakness winner Red Bullet, recovering from a virus; and Albert the Great, who won the Dwyer but ran poorly in the Jim Dandy. The status of the Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus is uncertain pending his sale.</p>
        <p>''Where he goes next depends on how he comes out of this race,'' Mandella said of his horse.</p>
        <p>Referring to the Travers, he added, ''But if everything is good, there's nothing I would rather do.''</p>
