        <p>As the heat was beginning to rise from the pavement late yesterday morning, 115th Street between Lenox and Fifth Avenues was bathed in white. Hundreds of people, dressed from head to foot in white cotton dresses or slacks and shirts, were arriving by the busload and gathering in the center of the street for a baptism by fire hose.</p>
        <p>Each August since 1937, the United House of Prayer for All People, a nondenominational Pentecostal church with three million members in 28 states, has held mass baptisms on 115th Street in East Harlem, using a fire hose to spray hundreds with baptismal waters.</p>
        <p>The church holds mass baptisms across the country each summer as part of a convocation ceremony in which congregants offer repentance and seek renewal. In most places, as many as 2,000 congregants will be submerged in a local river or a pool. But in New York City, where access to rivers is limited and where pools are not easy to find, the House of Prayer has always used the municipal water supply, blessed by the church's bishop.</p>
        <p>''Baptism is a faith thing and has nothing to do with the actual water,'' explained Apostle H. M. Swaringer, the pastor of the United House of Prayer in Harlem, at Frederick Douglass Boulevard and 125th Street. ''In the Scripture, in places where there was no water, they used the clouds. It's all according to the conditions, what's available to us.''</p>
        <p>Many church members travel to different regions of the country for baptisms throughout the summer. This year, about 500 congregants gathered for yesterday's New York regional ceremony, with buses arriving from Washington, Boston and Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Helena and Gracie Myrick, sisters from Baltimore, said they got up at 3 a.m. yesterday to make the four-hour trip to East Harlem. Both  said they are baptized every year, as their 91-year-old father has been for years, at House of Prayer convocations in 13 states.</p>
        <p>The baptism began just before noon, after the church's national leader, Bishop S. C. Madison, arrived from Charlotte, N.C., and ascended the stage to the rousing, swinging sounds of the McCollough Sons of Thunder, one of four gospel brass ''shout'' bands that performed. People clapped and danced, and waved their hands in the air, as some put on shower caps and bathing caps, or draped towels over their shoulders.</p>
        <p>''I ask the Lord to bless the water of the New York reservoir,'' said Bishop Madison, to the joyful assembly. ''I ask him to change this water to the water of the river Jordan.''</p>
        <p>Then a church official unleashed the torrent, and water from a fire hose attached to a city hydrant sprayed high into the air, raining down on congregants for about 15 minutes. Some people shook their heads and grimaced at the cold spray, others danced to music of the brass bands, some dropped to the ground and a few threw their hands in the air as if to grasp the falling blessing. When the deluge ended, drenched participants straggled off, smiling.</p>
        <p>''It makes you feel good, relaxed,'' said Rose M. King, 41, of Harlem, shivering in a soaked T-shirt. ''It takes all the evil away.''</p>
        <p>From the 1920's until almost midcentury, the House of Prayer's church stood on 115th Street between Lenox and Fifth Avenues. It was demolished in 1947 to make way for a public housing development, the Martin Luther King Jr. Houses.</p>
        <p>Church members return to the street every year to honor their old house of worship, and some who live in the surrounding neighborhood have come to see the convocation ceremony as part of their own tradition.</p>
        <p>George A. Donaldson, who moved into the King Houses with his family in 1951, said the neighborhood's annual reunion is planned to coincide with the House of Prayer ceremony.</p>
        <p>''Anyone who grew up on 115th Street and Fifth is naturally going to want to come out for this,'' said Mr. Donaldson, who greeted old neighbors as he watched the convocation from the curb. ''There used to be a group of tenements across the street, and most of the residents there were members of the church, so you can imagine how it used to be. Since then, everyone has scattered. But this has such a strong pull that it brings everyone back every year.''</p>
