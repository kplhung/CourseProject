        <p>Toni Taylor and her Pi Dance Theater took to a patch of lush grass in the Clinton Community Garden on Saturday afternoon and summoned up all the pleasure of the unexpected in a city where surprise is a constant. Passers-by stopped to peer into the garden on West 48th Street, one of them with a chortling green parrot on her shoulder.</p>
        <p>Inside, ringed by trees and patches of tall flowers, Ms. Taylor and her two performers presented outdoor dances that responded un-self-consciously to their setting, with magical simplicity.</p>
        <p>The most enjoyable of the program's three formal works was ''Ladders,'' a trio set to the music of Thomas Tallis and George Crumb. ''Ladders'' began with Ms. Taylor winding around a tall ladder, swathing it in the off-white fabric that had bound her. Then she unwound the fabric into a bundle, unwound her gray turban to tie the bundle with, then tossed the thing away. ''Trust me, this is really a dance,'' her eyes seemed to say as she stared boldly out at the audience seated around her on the grass and on rustic benches.</p>
        <p>Nicole Lichau and Jillian Sweeney lifted the ladder and formed a tower with another. What followed was witty shape play for suspended and climbing bodies, until the ladders were turned to form a V from which the dancers rose like urban Venuses.</p>
        <p>Delicately slender and mysterious, Ms. Lichau looked like something that might have been growing in the garden. Ms. Sweeney was a compelling, natural yet stylish mover.</p>
        <p>All three dancers had an ungainly charm and a wonderfully relaxed way of engaging the audience in ''String Theory,'' set to Bach, and ''Roving to Join,'' set to an intriguing score by David Drinkwater that sounded like the music that might emanate from Fourth of July sparklers.</p>
        <p>In ''Dance on the Spot'' Ms. Taylor was midwife to a piece created by three audience volunteers: Jodi Collova, Eric Massa and LeeAnn Ledgerwood, a musician who had been passing by and came in to see what was going on. The piece, performed with Ms. Sweeney and Ms. Lichau, made imaginative and funny use of the garden setting. Ms. Taylor's impromptu lesson in choreography, cogent and astute, was even more impressive.</p>
