        <p>Detectives were seeking suspects yesterday after one of the most violent nights in New York City this year, a series of altercations or gunfights in which 20 people were shot and four others stabbed. Six of the victims died. The police made only one arrest in the homicide cases, and were unsure last night whether the suspect would be charged with murder.</p>
        <p>The violence spanned all five boroughs of the city, beginning at nightfall Saturday and continuing almost until sunrise yesterday, and ranging from a shooting in a Staten Island bar to a dispute about a parking space in Harlem that turned into a knife fight in which a man was stabbed five times in the torso. That victim survived.</p>
        <p>The most violent incident occurred in the Bronx as revelers scrambled for cover at 1:25 a.m. yesterday when a gunman fired a pistol inside a throng of people at a block party on Garden Place in the Wakefield neighborhood, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>The shots ignited a gun battle that, in an instant, turned a crowd of hundreds into a panicked stampede as the drinkers and dancers sprinted away, some tripping over one another, in a search for safety. As many as 30 or 40 shots were fired, witnesses said, and the police said shell casings from at least three pistols -- a .45-caliber, a .380-caliber and a 9-millimeter -- were found on the ground.</p>
        <p>The police said eight people were shot, one fatally, and a woman was struck by a car that apparently barreled through the crowd as its driver fled the bedlam. The police also said one man had his throat slashed. The youngest victim was a 2-year-old boy, Javaru Hamilton, who was grazed on the foot by a bullet.</p>
        <p>''It got out of control,'' said Sgt. James Foley, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>The man who died, Mark E. Harris, 38, was shot in the head and died on the street near the party's barbecue stand. Sergeant Foley said Mr. Harris -- a Jamaican immigrant, cabdriver, barber and father of three -- was a bystander.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris's wife, Naudeen, who said he had been home an hour before he died, seemed devastated yesterday, saying the family had just moved into a house in the neighborhood after years of living in public housing. She said she heard of her husband's death almost immediately after it happened, and collapsed in tears. ''Until now, things had been looking up,'' she said.</p>
        <p>None of the other victims' injuries were life-threatening, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police arrested one man after the shooting, Damien Elliot, 18, and said he was apprehended at the scene while carrying a .45-caliber pistol and was charged with criminal possession of a weapon. Sergeant Foley said it was not yet clear if bullets from that weapon had struck any of the victims. The matter remained under investigation last night.</p>
        <p>Although violence has flared now and then throughout the year, the city's homicide rate had declined recently, falling to just below that of last year. In the past, the police have offered a variety of theories for a flare-up in shootings and homicides that occur periodically. Sometimes, they have said the increases were statistical blips; on other occasions, they have attributed the violence to warm, clear weather, which draws more people out onto the streets. The authorities declined to comment in detail yesterday.</p>
        <p>Deputy Chief Thomas P. Fahey, a police spokesman, said only, ''It was a bad night.''</p>
        <p>The other homicides included one in an argument inside a restaurant near the intersection of 92nd Street and 37th Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens, that escalated into a knife and bottle fight. The police said Roberto Albanco, of Northern Boulevard, died of multiple stab wounds. Two other men were injured, one critically, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police were also investigating the fatal shooting of an unidentified man during a dispute inside Zadokos Bar at 59 Victory Boulevard on Staten Island. Three other men were shot, the police said, including one who drove to New Jersey with a gunshot wound in his leg. The gunman fled and was not arrested.</p>
        <p>The other victims included Thomas Workman, 24, who was found dead of gunshot wounds at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and East 132nd Street in Harlem; Victor Losorio, 26, who was fatally shot in the head at 35th Avenue and Prince Street in Flushing, Queens; and Garfield Tucker, 42, whose body was found in front of 45 Parade Place in Prospect Park, Brooklyn. Mr. Tucker had been shot once in the head and multiple times in the torso, the police said.  There were no arrests, they said, in any of these cases.</p>
