        <p>High Drama  At the age of 15, Antonio Vivaldi became a priest. That might help explain the satanic elements coursing through ''Orlando Finto Pazzo'' (''Orlando Plays Mad''), a long-lost Vivaldi opera, written when he was 36 and hidden in a Turin library until its rediscovery two years ago. On Friday the Tete a Tete Opera Company will perform the work for the first time since 1714 at the Battersea Arts Center in London. Translated into English by Bill Bankes-Jones, a co-director of the company, the opera tells of Orlando's mission to destroy the evil sorceress Ersilla and her magic garden. In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph in London, Mr. Bankes-Jones compared the work to the television series ''Dynasty,'' with ''very glamorous people in shimmering settings behaving deplorably for their own selfish ends.'' Information: 011-44-207-223-2223.</p>
        <p>Count on It  Closer to home, Giuseppe Verdi's ''Don Carlos,'' No. 25 of 28 operas, will take its chronological place in the New York Grand Opera Company's presentation of the entire Verdi canon. The free performance will conclude the company's 27th season in Central Park and the seventh year of its eight-season Viva, Verdi! Festival. Vincent La Selva will conduct the opera on Wednesday at 6 p.m. at the Central Park SummerStage, 72nd Street off Fifth Avenue, in the original five-act French version composed for the Paris Opera during the city's 1867 exposition. It's a rarity for New York, where this version hasn't been heard since 1877. (Rain date, Aug. 14.) Information: (212) 245-8837.</p>
        <p>Laughing Through Tears  No, it's not the title of a bad painting. Rather, ''Sad Clowns on Velvet'' is meant to evoke the dark humor of three Chekhov monologues that depict life as, well, hell. The downhearted trilogy -- ''On the Harmful Effects of Tobacco,'' ''The Tragedian in Spite of Himself'' and ''A Moscow Hamlet'' -- will be performed by Peter Brown and Ian W. Hill as part of the Pure Pop 2000 Festival, beginning on Thursday at Nada Classic, 167 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side. Information: (212) 420-1466.</p>
