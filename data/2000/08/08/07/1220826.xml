        <p>Three years ago an experiment in artistic democracy began. And last week it ended.</p>
        <p>The Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue, a heady mix of summer camp, artists' colony, encounter group and think tank founded and directed by the playwright and actor Anna Deavere Smith, closed its doors on Friday -- at least for now.</p>
        <p>Each summer for the last three years the institute assembled a group of artists and scholars for six weeks of what Ms. Smith called ''artistic boot camp.'' The artists presented their works in progress -- pieces of theater, dance and music intended to induce dialogue about civic issues. Scholars were invited to jump into the fray. And a core audience of people who had agreed to go to every performance had been gathered to join in the discussions after each performance. The three-year program, with the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research at Harvard University and the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., as joint hosts, cost $4.2 million and was paid for largely by a grant from the Ford Foundation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith is best known for her one-woman plays ''Fires in the Mirror,'' about the conflicts between blacks and Jews in Crown Heights, Brooklyn; ''Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,'' about the riots after the first Rodney King verdict; and ''House Arrest,'' a multivoiced meditation on the American presidency and particularly on Thomas Jefferson's relationship with his slave Sally Hemings and Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>For those plays, Ms. Smith interviewed hundreds of people of different races and ages, somehow managing to internalize their expressions, anger and quirks enough to be able to portray them with astonishing verisimilitude.</p>
        <p>The Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue was, in some sense, like an Anna Deavere Smith play writ large. She said she was trying to ''create a frame'' that would hold ''many different voices and histories and expressions in the same place and still be coherent.''</p>
        <p>In the last week of performances, a 22-year-old Rwandan playwright, Hope Azeda, presented her play about hatred and reconciliation between the Tutsi and Hutu; the singers Suzzy Roche and her sister Maggie sang prayers written by audience members; Sheila Kennedy, a professor of architecture at Harvard, pondered the cultural fear of hollow spaces; Patricia Williams, a law professor at Columbia University, and Oliver Lake, a jazz saxophonist, riffed on cloning, shadows, the apocalypse and the subjunctive; Ms. Smith screened ''Twilight: Los Angeles,'' a movie based on her play; and on the final night a multiracial cast performed ''Piano,'' her play about the Cuban insurrection against Spain in 1898. The art was not there for art's sake, though.</p>
        <p>''The art is a mask'' for social issues, Ms. Smith said. The point, she suggested, is not to fasten on the mask but ''to get behind it,'' to ''engender discussion.'' And ''the audience is a critical part of that.'' The performance of Ms. Smith's play ''Piano'' was a prime example. Before the performance, Ms. Smith told the audience that her aim was to write a play that would throw many classes and races together in one living room and that would allow the actors to act in their own skins.</p>
        <p>At the heart of ''Piano'' is a plantation house owned by Spanish colonials. Little do they know that the people who clean and cook for them every day are insurrectos, revolutionaries planning to free Cuba from Spain and to free themselves from domestic slavery. Susanna, an African, is the head of the staff and has adopted an African girl to clean the floors and to be her revolutionary protegee. She trains her by telling her that the piano is an angry lion whose paws she must clean without stirring the beast. The Chinese cook makes African food. His wife is a smiling Chinese hostess and the mistress of the Spanish master of the house. The music teacher seems to be part Spanish, part African.</p>
        <p>The drama begins when some visitors arrive: a rich and liberated  American woman traveling with her African-American boyfriend, and a brutal Spanish general, the brother of the man of the house, who has come to defend Spanish interests against the insurrectos and rape some women along the way. The house is a revolutionary tinderbox, ready to explode.</p>
        <p>Brilliant as it is, the play was not the thing. It was merely the mask.  The final act belonged to the audience. A woman asked why some of the audience members who remained grave at moments when race was discussed had laughed at japes about rape and male anatomy. A man from the core audience piped up, ''It's a democracy.'' Someone else tried to break into the conversation, only to be hushed. Donald Byrd, a choreographer who had been at the institute for all three years, said it was the ''laughter of recognition.'' And the dialogue ended with one of the institute artists, Margo Jefferson, who is also a columnist for The New York Times, saying she trusted laughter as a response a lot more than sobriety. The crowd dispersed.</p>
        <p>The response that Ms. Smith wanted to evoke, she said, was not a standing ovation, which she got, but rather an audience full of people who rise to their feet and say, ''What can I do?'' That was not what she got.</p>
        <p>In her final week at the institute Ms. Smith said, ''It has been an extraordinary laboratory.'' More than anything, she said, the institute has set her thinking about three words, ''We the people.'' In this world, there is ''no single great explainer,'' she said. '' 'We the people' means something different than it did in 1968. We still haven't figured out how 'we' is a big 'we.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith said the easy part was dealing with the artists. She recalled some of her favorite moments and most had to do with a melding of voices. She thought of Ysaye Barnwell of Sweet Honey in the Rock getting 200 people singing and rocking to four different spirituals at the same time. She thought of Suzzy Roche singing a Vietnam veteran's private prayer, which Ms. Roche called a ''melting experience.'' And there were Ms. Williams and Mr. Lake, creating what Ms. Williams called ''an allusive conversation'' between music and speech.</p>
        <p>The hard part, Ms. Smith said, had to do with the audience. The first year there were about 160 in the core audience, but they had only four performances to go to. The crowd was unusually varied. Ms. Williams recalled a performance where some people in the audience had once been homeless or in prison. But at the end there were 15 performances and the core audience, about 90 people, was not as mixed as it might have been. Although there was a range of races -- 58 white, 24 black, 4 Hispanic, 2 Asian, 2 Indian, 1 Arab -- the great majority were middle-aged or older and middle class.</p>
        <p>Perhaps part of the difficulty had to do with being on the Harvard campus. Of course, there were some obvious advantages. Cornel West, a professor of Afro-American studies and religion at Harvard, showed up and ''blessed'' almost every performance. A small group of professors, including Henry Louis Gates Jr., the chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard, and Charles T. Ogletree, a Harvard law professor, were often there, ready to leap into the civic debate at a moment's notice. But there were disadvantages too. ''People conflate Cambridge with Harvard,'' Ms. Smith said. It was hard to draw people from other neighborhoods in the Boston area consistently.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams, who has been at the institute for three years, said, ''We didn't reach every last person in Roxbury.'' And that may have had something to do with being at Harvard. ''I'm from Roxbury,'' Ms. Williams said, ''and when I went to law school at Harvard I was self-conscious about whether I had the right to be there.''</p>
        <p>Maybe it is not so different from the practical difficulty presented in  ''Piano'': the insurrectos must plan the revolution while living in the  house of the Spanish masters. Are they really free to talk as they please? Where else could they meet? Can any of the masters be trusted? How big can ''We the people'' be?</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith was given a standing ovation after the screening of the movie ''Twilight: Los Angeles,'' in which she herself had taken the roles of dozens of people, including a Beverly Hills real estate agent, the  trucker Reginald O. Denny, one of his assailants, a looter, a Korean woman whose husband was killed, a pregnant Hispanic woman who was shot in the crossfire, the former police chief Daryl F. Gates, the diva Jessye Norman and Professor West drinking cognac.</p>
        <p>She took the opportunity to ponder the question of bigness and to compare herself to a surgeon who was asked why he had chosen to operate on children with cancer. Expected to say something about saving children's lives, he simply said, ''It gave me the opportunity to do a bigger operation.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 14, 2000, Monday  A headline last Monday about the Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue, a performing program at Harvard founded by the playwright Anna Deavere Smith, referred imprecisely to its end. It has closed, at least for now, because its three-year grant will expire this year, not because its offerings did not rally audiences.</p>
