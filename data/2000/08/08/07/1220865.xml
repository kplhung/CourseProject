        <p>Here comes Rusty Wallace. He is surging in the juicy stock car subplot known as the Winston Cup Series points race and now dares to tell the world about his dream of winning another championship.</p>
        <p>Following a second-place finish on Saturday in the Brickyard 400, Wallace is in fifth place in the drivers' standing and will trail the leader, Bobby Labonte, by 268 points entering next Sunday's demanding road-course race at Watkins Glen, N.Y.</p>
        <p>That is a lot of points. Labonte trailed Dale Jarrett, the eventual champion, by 293 points after the Brickyard 400 last year and was able to trim the deficit by 62 points in the final 12 races.</p>
        <p>But Wallace, an audacious Missourian who turns 44 this month, has 14 races to catch Labonte this year. More important, he has a fleet of powerful stock cars owned by Roger Penske, the racing mogul, and he has been driving particularly hard recently.</p>
        <p>He lost Saturday's race when Labonte passed him with 14 laps to go, but Wallace led for 110 laps and earned as many points in the intricate points system as Labonte. Wallace has won four poles in his last eight races and has finished in the top three in three of his last four races.</p>
        <p>Wallace was in ninth place after a race at Loudon, N.H., on July 9. That Wallace has made up so much ground so quickly has caused him to be even more buoyant than he usually is.</p>
        <p>''I tell you what: I'm thinking championship right now,'' Wallace said Saturday. ''I wasn't thinking championship four or five races ago. I shouldn't say that, but I'm feeling a lot better about it right now.''</p>
        <p>The competition will be intense. Just ahead of Wallace in the standing are Jeff Burton, the seven-time champion Dale Earnhardt, Jarrett and Labonte, and each has his own design on winning a championship.</p>
        <p>''I want to catch him in the points; it's still not impossible to do that,'' Earnhardt said of Labonte after the race. ''He gained a lot on us today. We've got to gain some back on him.''</p>
        <p>Labonte, a 36-year-old Texan, has held his lead zealously. He has been atop the points race for more than three months. He has never won a championship, but he won five races last year and pushed Jarrett down the stretch.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you have to lose a championship before you win one,'' said Labonte's older brother, Terry, who has won two.</p>
        <p>Bobby Labonte is also driving for a team that has taken a cue from its finicky owner, Joe Gibbs, the former Washington Redskins coach, and refuses to take anything for granted.</p>
        <p>As Labonte said on Saturday: ''There's always something that comes up, something that you've got to work yourself through.''</p>
        <p>Jimmy Makar, Labonte's crew chief, said: ''We just have to continue what we're doing. The game plan is to go into every single week with that race in mind. This win is important, but tomorrow morning the focus will be on Watkins Glen. If we do that, things will take care of themselves.''</p>
        <p>Labonte did not drive well last year at the Glen. He qualified 22nd and finished 24th. Labonte did finish fourth in the only other race on a road course this year, in Northern California, but Wallace is a demon on road courses.</p>
        <p>He set a qualifying record last year at Watkins Glen and finished third. He has six road-course victories in his career, tied with Bobby Allison for No. 1 on the career list. Passing is even more difficult on a road course than it is on a typical Nascar track.</p>
        <p>Wallace has won just two races this year and has not been as dominant as he was when he won his only championship in 1989 and 10 races in 1993, but he has run near the front all year. He won the Pennsylvania 500 on July 23 when his teammate, Jeremy Mayfield, had a tire go flat on the last lap.</p>
        <p>And Wallace has a superb crew. If he can qualify well, he thinks he is capable of holding his position, at the very least. Labonte's last pit stop on Saturday was a stunning 14.5 seconds. But Wallace's last pit stop was almost as stunning, 15.4 seconds, and he passed Labonte for the lead after giving it up.</p>
        <p>''These guys are workaholics,'' Wallace said of his crew. ''They're running, they're working out, they're running laps, they're exercising.''</p>
        <p>This is why Wallace dreams out loud about a championship. He has a long way to go, but the distance between him and Labonte suddenly seems shorter.</p>
