        <p>Establish a Web site with lots of links to other sites, and they call you an aggregator.</p>
        <p>But Jim Romenesko, a man much noticed in his own profession because he notices it back, has begun to reach out far beyond his humble HTML beginnings.

        <p>Establish a Web site with lots of links to other sites, and they call you an aggregator.</p>
        <p>But Jim Romenesko, a man much noticed in his own profession because he notices it back, has begun to reach out far beyond his humble HTML beginnings. His MediaNews.org Web site is becoming an online version of the local bar, where journalists go after hours to argue, to announce their new jobs, to toast their friends and denounce their enemies.</p>
        <p>In the process, Mr. Romenesko, a journalist himself, has transformed himself twice over.</p>
        <p>First he was a simple, if obsessive, aggregator who created a site linked to other sites featuring media news or media criticism.</p>
        <p>Then he was hired by a journalism research center, the Poynter Institute, and, along with his links, he made a place for running discussions, like the current give-and-take -- or bash-and-poke -- between journalists and public relations people who are sometimes called flacks by the journalists. (The nastier themes of this particular battle are punctuated with some gentle intermezzos, like the observation that ''Flacks are like spouses: half the time, they just want to be heard.'')</p>
        <p>Last week, he expanded his portfolio again with the publication of a long revisionist history of a 1998 controversy involving the columnist Mike Barnicle of The Boston Globe, which is owned by The New York Times. Mr. Barnicle resigned under duress after accusations that he plagiarized a comedian's jokes and that he had inadequately verified a story about terminally ill children. Mr. Kennedy's account provides new details about both incidents. This is a new stage in the evolution of MediaNews.org. It is not just for links any more. And it is not just for journalists.</p>
        <p>The article by Eugene Kennedy, who is identified as an author and a columnist, is based on some original reporting, new documents provided by Mr. Barnicle and a review of the record. It argues that Mr. Barnicle was the victim of shifting standards and deeply mixed messages from the editor of The Globe, Matthew V. Storin. (Mr. Storin said on Friday that he had followed the discussion but did not want to comment on it or on the new direction of Mr. Romenesko's site.)</p>
        <p>Among the first people to e-mail the site after Mr. Kennedy's article was posted was the author Norman Mailer, who wrote: ''Despite the position of The Boston Globe, I don't think Michael Barnicle received anything in the way of a fair or balanced judgment. And the careful assessment in Eugene Kennedy's piece goes just about all the way to prove it.'' The historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and her husband, the political consultant Richard Goodwin, wrote to call the Kennedy piece proof Mr. Barnicle was a victim of ''political correctness.''</p>
        <p>So did Peter Maas, a sometime collaborator with Mr. Barnicle, who paused just a second with his nod to the ''fine Kennedy piece on Barnicle'' before lambasting Richard Blow, a former top editor at George magazine, over his handling of a piece by Mr. Maas and Mr. Barnicle. Mr. Blow's response came quickly, and began, ''Has Peter Maas fallen on his head?'' Then things really took off. Journalists at two different publications were claiming all or partial credit for Mr. Barnicle's downfall. The disagreement between Mr. Blow and Mr. Maas escalated (Mr. Maas called Mr. Blow's assertions ''fiction,'' while Mr. Blow responded that ''Peter Maas didn't like being fact-checked then, and apparently he doesn't now.'')</p>
        <p>One amused bystander observed in his own posting that ''I don't pretend to know the relationships among your correspondents about Mike Barnicle -- they sound like they all live in the same condo and hate each other.''</p>
        <p>Of course, on any given day, vitriol can fly in any discussion thread on any site. What sets Mr. Romenesko's site apart, beyond its evolution, is the seriousness with which it is followed among print and online journalists.</p>
        <p>Celia McGee, a reporter for The Daily News in New York, announced her move from media columnist to feature writer on Mr. Romenesko's site, and Steven Brill, the founder of Brill's Content, used it as a public forum to discuss how freelancers should be compensated for the online resale of their work.</p>
        <p>The redesign of the online magazine Salon was excoriated by Mr. Romenesko's readers. Salon's editor, David Talbot, said in an interview on Friday: ''On the one hand, it's a little embarrassing to have your dramas played out that way on a bulletin board for everyone to comment on. On the other hand, it's a useful way for journalists to sort out these issues.''</p>
        <p>The Barnicle article, and the attendant discussion, however, stretched the concept of a discussion toward the breaking point. As James Naughton, president of the Poynter Institute, explained in an interview, ''We weren't vouching for'' Mr. Kennedy's long, long e-mail, ''but we weren't holding it out of the dialogue about a substantive ongoing issue in journalism.''</p>
