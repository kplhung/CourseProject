        <p>As the changeover to digital television was starting, government leaders and industry executives described the transition as one of those rare touchstone events that would, in time, change the lives of every American.</p>
        <p>''Everything will be different,'' Reed E. Hundt said in 1996 when, as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, he was about to approve the rules that set the transition in motion. ''The change is so extreme that many people have not grasped it.''</p>
        <p>Now, however, many Americans still have not grasped digital television. Four years after Mr. Hundt spoke and two years after the first digital television sets went on sale, few Americans even know the change is under way. And the transition is so mired in intractable problems, squabbles and controversies that some industry executives now worry that the current plan for the digital rollout could fail.</p>
        <p>How long will the broadcasters be willing to spend money transmitting digital signals if there are no viewers? How long will the government allow television stations to tie up two channels -- one analog, the other digital -- at a cost of many billions of dollars? The government is eager to auction off the analog channels, and is already counting the auction proceeds -- billions of dollars -- in future budget projections.</p>
        <p>Although the questions have no answers at present, a consensus is emerging that the current approach is not working.</p>
        <p>''The transition as a whole is faltering,'' Ben Tucker, chairman of the National Association of Broadcasters' television board, said in a recent letter to the F.C.C.</p>
        <p>Government initiatives to jump start the transition have been either absent or ineffectual. William E. Kennard, chairman of the the F.C.C., occasionally inveighs against the delays, threatening to pass rules that could clear some logjams. But the commission's rule-making procedures allow such long periods for public comment and internal discussion that they can drag on for months or years.</p>
        <p>Congress, meanwhile, has shown little interest in this subject of late -- despite one inconclusive public hearing on July 25.</p>
        <p>Under the federal rules that were set when the transition began, the nation's television broadcasters were each given a digital channel to use alongside their existing analog channels during the transition period. In 2006, all of the nation's 1,600 analog television channels are to be shut down and be auctioned off to the highest bidder; auction winners will use the space on the airwaves for wireless communications services or other purposes.</p>
        <p>When that day comes, broadcasters will have only their digital channels, and only people with new digital television sets, or converter boxes, will be able to watch over-the-air television.</p>
        <p>The date can be pushed back, of course. But when the government set that deadline three years ago, officials vowed with certainty that by now the transition would be well under way because digital television would offer so many compelling programs and so many dazzling new digital services that consumers would line up to buy the new sets.</p>
        <p>Or so the thinking went.</p>
        <p>Despite two years of aggressive marketing by consumer electronics companies, only about 230,000 digital television monitors have been sold in the United States, even though they now sell for as little as $2,500, compared with $6,000 two years ago.</p>
        <p>The Consumer Electronics Association argues that those numbers are impressive for a new product. But the association's figures also show that only about 40,000 of those buyers have also bought the new digital receivers that are needed to watch the new programming, and the latest figures show that sales of those receivers have actually fallen sharply in recent months. In the digital world, the television display and the receiver are usually sold separately, and the least expensive of the receivers now sells for about $600.</p>
        <p>Those sales figures are minuscule compared with about 260 million television sets nationwide that will have to be replaced, or updated with a converter box, by 2006. Price is an obvious problem dampening sales; a comparable big-screen analog television costs $1,500 or less. But the largest reason seems to be that  there's almost nothing new to watch.</p>
        <p>The most compelling feature of digital television to many industry executives is its ability to broadcast high-definition pictures so sharp and clear that they look almost real. But even with about 150 digital television stations broadcasting in 52 cities nationwide, there is little true HDTV on the air. During nearly all of the broadcast day on most of the channels, the stations are simply showing digital copies of their regular fare, giving viewers little incentive to make the change.</p>
        <p>The few hours of HDTV that are being shown -- CBS is the leader, with offerings like sports, movies and prime-time shows -- are in large part being paid for by television manufacturers or other companies that, network executives contend, have more to gain from the success of the format. The networks seem little interested in HDTV if it costs them any significant money.</p>
        <p>''High-definition television is absolutely stalled; there's no broadcaster interest,'' Ed Grebow, president of Sony's broadcast and professional company, said in a recent article in the journal Electronic Media. Mr. Grebow, whose unit at Sony sells high-definition cameras and other equipment, declined requests for further comment.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Sony's television division recently canceled its line of high-definition television sets that were scheduled to go on sale in the fall. The company now plans to delay the introduction until at least next year because of uncertainty about the transition and the many problems besetting it.</p>
        <p>Production problems also played a role. But ''there's too much political jockeying and positioning going on behind high definition,'' said Victor J. Pacor, head of Sony's television division. ''And we're not comfortable building sets based on what we think will occur.''</p>
        <p>Konka, a Chinese company hoping to enter the American market with a new line of high-definition sets, also announced a delay last month, for the same reasons.</p>
        <p>What's more, several hundred of the nation's television stations have made deals to lease part of their digital channel for other uses -- principally to send audio-video streaming media to personal computers equipped with digital over-the-air receivers.</p>
        <p>Network executives oppose these side deals; they fear that if part of the channel is put to other uses, there will not be enough space left for high-definition programming, which can easily fill the entire channel. They also complain that digital television was supposed to bring exciting new services to TV's -- not PC's.</p>
        <p>At the Congressional hearing late last month, Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, chastised some station owners who were planning to lease out their spectrum, saying: ''That was clearly not in the deal. If broadcasters did that, I think you'd run the risk of Congress revisiting the deal and reclaiming the spectrum. It would be a clear deal breaker not to show Americans HDTV.''</p>
        <p>But the biggest and most disruptive controversy is a growing debate over the adequacy of the transmission format for broadcasting digital signals. Tests over the last year have indicated that television sets with indoor antennas generally cannot receive a reliable digital picture.</p>
        <p>In February, the F.C.C. rejected a request from several hundred television stations to revise the format, and equipment makers have promised to make the current system work better. But since then, the chorus of discontent has grown, and the critics now include ABC and NBC. Even the Advanced Television Systems Committee, an industry group that controls the format's technical standard and has been its most aggressive defender, recently said it had started an initiative to improve or revise it.</p>
        <p>That caused anxiety at Sony and other companies, where executives worry that they may be building digital television receivers that might not work with a revised standard.</p>
        <p>''We'd have to go back to the drawing board, and it would probably be four years before we could get new product out,'' said Dave Arland, a spokesman for Thomson Consumer Electronics, which sells more televisions in this country than any other company, most under the RCA brand.</p>
        <p>''I think that would kill the transition,'' Mr. Arland added. ''I'm not even sure we would make the investment, frankly.''</p>
        <p>And there is yet another problem. About two-thirds of the nation's television viewers subscribe to cable, but most cable companies refuse to carry the broadcasters' new digital shows.</p>
        <p>More than two years ago, the F.C.C. opened a proceeding to determine whether the ''must carry'' rule that requires cable systems to carry local analog broadcasts would also apply to the digital world. The commission still has not made a decision and has set no date for doing so. But even if the F.C.C. were to decide to require cable companies to carry broadcasters' digital shows starting tomorrow, most cable subscribers who own digital television sets still could not see the new programming. That is because industry negotiators have been trying for more than two years to agree on a way to connect a digital set to a digital cable box.</p>
        <p>They still have not agreed, caught in a seemingly endless debate between the set makers and Hollywood studios over copy-protection techniques for digital shows. The studios fear that digital copies of their recent movies appearing on cable will be seized by pirates and copied endlessly.</p>
        <p>Under pressure from the F.C.C.,  the industries did seem to agree on one issue last month: how to label future digital televisions that are cable ready. Because there will be two types of cable-ready sets -- those that can receive digital programming and others that are also capable of supporting interactive programming -- two different names were needed. After months of discussion, the television manufacturers and cable companies proudly announced that they had agreed on two names: Digital TV-Cable Connect and Digital TV-Cable Interactive.</p>
        <p>The names do not roll off the tongue easily -- one reason that Circuit City and other large television retailers immediately objected. The Consumer Electronics Association quickly backed away from the agreement, saying their members were not obliged to adopt the new names, even though the cable industry contended that the agreement had been binding.</p>
        <p>And, like so much else in this blighted transition, no one knows if or when that debate might be resolved.</p>
