        <p>When Hugo Dixon resigned from The Financial Times last December to start his own Web site, heads turned both inside and outside the newsroom. After all, Mr. Dixon had become the newspaper's franchise columnist -- the lead writer and editor of the much-heralded Lex column. Each day, he provided smart commentary on the merger of the day or a company's recent earnings report.</p>
        <p>Even without a byline, the columnist was so well known in the world of London finance that his departure from The Financial Times was chronicled in most of the big national newspapers. Gossipy items about his exit peppered the papers with almost the same attention showered on the Spice Girls.</p>
        <p>But that attention turned to real rubbernecking in May, when Mr. Dixon announced that he had effectively defected to The Financial Times's rival, The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Dixon, 36, signed a deal to begin publishing a daily column in September that mimics The Lex -- based on content from his new Web site, BreakingViews.com -- in The Wall Street Journal's European edition. In addition, Dow Jones, The Journal's parent company, took a 7 percent stake in BreakingViews.com, which offers quick financial commentary online about breaking-news subjects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dixon's move came as The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times, a unit of Pearson P.L.C., are in an intensifying brawl aimed at increasing readership on each other's home turf. And the focus on Mr. Dixon has recently become more intense because of an accusation being privately levied by some of his former colleagues: Mr. Dixon may have a conflict of interest because his company is being partly financed by people and companies that he and his team of journalists are supposed to be writing commentary about.</p>
        <p>In a city that is not known for objective journalism, and at a time when media companies increasingly are financially intertwined with the people and companies they write about, it is not clear if the accusation is fair. Mr. Dixon acknowledges that the company's investors include Morgan Stanley Dean Witter along with his longtime friend, Roland Rudd, who owns Finsbury, one of the leading financial public relations firms in London representing leading European companies, among others.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Dixon rebuts the criticism as simply noise. ''I myself think it's an issue that's been blown up to be an issue, but I don't believe it's an issue,'' he said. ''I don't know who has a 3 percent stake in New York Times or Dow Jones or in Pearson or whatever, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was an investment bank that did. Everyone owns stakes.'' He also said that the stakes are ''passive'' and that neither financial backer has a seat on his board.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Dixon, has been in the limelight since he left The Financial Times just before Christmas, taking his colleague from the Lex column and partner, Jonathan Ford, with him to help him start BreakingViews.com.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dixon says he conceived the idea for a financial-commentary Web site more than four years ago, just after interviewing William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, during a dinner with Michael Kinsley, who had just started Slate, a political and culture Web magazine owned by Microsoft.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't clear to me whether it made sense to put a political magazine online,'' he recalls thinking. ''But in the financial arena, where investors are trading stocks'' on a day of news developments, he said, ''speed is essential. So it seemed to me that financial journalism was naturally suited to the Internet.''</p>
        <p>At the time, though, in 1996, the Internet had yet to emerge in Europe with the same force as in the United States. It was not until last year, ''with sites like TheStreet.com going public and money so available for ideas like this,'' he said, that he began to consider the idea seriously. Having raised about $1 million in a first round of financing by December, Mr. Dixon and Mr. Ford turned in their resignations at The Financial Times.</p>
        <p>''To leave an established organization is quite a wrench,'' he said. ''They would try to give me all these goodies, and I was saying no with increasingly strange excuses about why I was turning down these jobs.''</p>
        <p>The bombshell came when he told his ex-employer that he planned to start a Web site that would effectively be an online version of Lex, the paper's franchise column. In what may have seemed like a further affront to The Financial Times, he went on to be named the British business journalist of the year for his work at the newspaper, and he audaciously promoted BreakingViews.com at the ceremony.</p>
        <p>Then, early in May, he announced that he had raised $6.7 million and made his syndication deal with The Wall Street Journal Europe. The timing could not have been more important in the bruising battle between the two business broadsheets.</p>
        <p>The Wall Street Journal redesigned its European edition in February to better suit readers and has been aggressively marketing the paper across the Continent. At the same time, The Financial Times has tried to make inroads in the United States with a $35 million advertising campaign starring Dan Aykroyd plugging its Web site, FT.com.</p>
        <p>Financial Times reporters and editors have been privately griping about Mr. Dixon's defection and his investment partners, though none agreed to do so publicly.</p>
        <p>Top executives at the paper were terse. Richard Lambert, the editor in chief, said simply, ''I don't have an opinion about it.''</p>
        <p>As for The Wall Street Journal, Richard J. Tofel, the Dow Jones vice president for corporate communications, said the company is committed to BreakingViews.com. ''In terms of financial firms having stakes in publishers, that's nothing new,'' he said. He pointed out that Dow Jones has a business relationship with General Electric through CNBC and also has business interests or alliances with Reuters and Hearst. ''Whether things are adequately disclosed is what's important,'' he said.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Dixon, the Web site and the column in The Wall Street Journal Europe will include a disclaimer if he or his staff ever write directly about any of his investors. He said there was no reason to put a disclaimer on articles, for example, about clients of Morgan Stanley ''because they advise on zillions of deals.''</p>
        <p>The New York Times operates a joint newsroom with and has an investment stake in TheStreet.com, an online financial news and commentary site that may compete with BreakingViews.com. The Street.com is partly owned by James J. Cramer, the hedge fund manager and columnist. It has policies to deal with the appearance of conflicts, and Mr. Cramer's columns carry disclaimers when he writes about stocks he owns.</p>
        <p>Despite the controversy, the reporting in BreakingViews.com does not so far seem to have been colored by its investors' interests. The site carried a critical column about Carlton Communications, one of Finsbury's largest clients, which was noted in an item in The Observer last Sunday. And when Mr. Dixon wrote a column this week about Pearson's acquisition of National Computer Systems, it included a disclaimer noting that Mr. Dixon had worked for the Financial Times and that he also owned shares in Pearson.</p>
        <p>Still, though Mr. Dixon is used to being in public view, his financial arrangements may expose him to a new level of scrutiny. He does not shy away from the attention.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of people from the FT coming to our site,'' Mr. Dixon said, grinning.</p>
