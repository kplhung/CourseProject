        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>File under D for dogs and ducks, or perhaps C for Central Park and Cheyenne, the wayward Australian shepherd mix who captivated crowds at Turtle Pond one steamy weekend.</p>
        <p>The incident began at 8:15 a.m., well within the park's 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. window for dogs to romp off leash. Heading down the path from Belvedere Castle with her guardian and two canine siblings, Cheyenne suddenly broke away and bounded into Turtle Pond, home of snapping turtles, ducks and loons.</p>
        <p>An astute mother mallard directed her ducklings toward the tall grass to the north, and proceeded to quack and flap her wings wildly. Cheyenne began a hot pursuit and although her clunky paddle was no match for the duck's easy glide, she was not deterred. Pleas from her agitated owner, a tennis ball thrown in her path and the gathering crowd failed to distract her from the task at hand. Cheyenne was no ordinary dog.</p>
        <p>Forty-five minutes later, the police and park staff arrived. Someone suggested the owner herself be sent into the pond to catch the dog. The owner, at wit's end, shed her sandals and made her way into the snapping-turtle-infested waters. Thus we saw a duck followed by a dog followed by a wild-haired woman wearing a life preserver provided by the Park Conservancy.</p>
        <p>It became clear that the woman had no more chance of catching the dog than the dog did of catching the duck. Finally two police officers took off on the pond in a rowboat. The capture was swift. The last thing we saw was the owner standing over Cheyenne, shaking her head and shouting, ''Cheyenne, how many times have I told you not to chase ducks!''</p>
        <p>LAURA MORRISON</p>
        <p>Ralph Holzwarth's friend, Debra Sweezey of Stone Mountain, Ga., was preparing Jessica, her 4-year-old daughter, for her first trip to Manhattan. Mrs. Sweezey mentioned some of the sights they would see and that they would ride the subway, ''a train that runs under the ground.'' Wide-eyed, Jessica asked: ''But how do we get down to the train? Do we have to dig?''</p>
        <p>THE IMAGE</p>
        <p>Perhaps you have seen me -- strolling in front of the Plaza or exercising in Central Park.</p>
        <p>I was born beautiful! How many times have I heard it! Life is never easy when an image must be preserved. As we grow older, it gets harder. If you really look closely, there are some signs of change. I still look good -- from a distance?</p>
        <p>My hair was always my best feature. Now it takes twice as long to get it the way it used to look. The daily manicure is a nuisance. Borderline starvation is the only way to keep my slimness. If that goes, I'm finished. I've always prided myself on my figure.</p>
        <p>How I envy you average-looking females, gaining weight, letting yourself go. Rollers, old bathrobes, you are still loved. No hours in the beauty salon for you listening to boring females.</p>
        <p>I still love the attention. I never tire of being admired. I am superior. But the price is getting too high.</p>
        <p>Soon I'll say goodbye to it all, let my hair go, keep late hours, gorge myself until I'm sick, run around my backyard, roll in the leaves and mud. I'll be free. Free to be myself, just another Yorkie.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>The Internet has introduced so many new words, like e-mail and e-commerce that I wonder if we'll have to redefine some of our current vocabulary. Can we look forward to:</p>
        <p>e-go -- to start a Net search.</p>
        <p>e-on -- synonym for ''online.''</p>
        <p>e-motion -- Web-surfing.</p>
        <p>e-mission-- a commitment to Internet research.</p>
        <p>e-quip -- a clever remark in a chat room.</p>
        <p>e-gret -- an electronic sympathy card.</p>
        <p>e-bullience -- lying about yourself online.</p>
        <p>e-cology-- getting an online B.A.</p>
        <p>e-clipse -- on-line movie scenes.</p>
        <p>CLARE HIGGINS</p>
        <p>SUMMER LAMENT</p>
        <p>Now is the time to climb a Rocky</p>
        <p>Back a Saratoga jockey</p>
        <p>Now is the time to roam the nation</p>
        <p>So why did I take a winter vacation?</p>
        <p>BERNARD DILBERT</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Like many, I am annoyed by people's supposed needs to have phone conversations wherever they are. Recently, my perspective shifted.</p>
        <p>I was taken by ambulance, in the middle of the night, to Beth Israel Hospital North with severe abdominal pains. In the morning, I began to worry about my outside appointments for that day and the next. I had no money with me, but I soon discovered that Beth Israel provides a cellular phone in the emergency room for patients. I called my neighbor, who has my keys, told her whom to call in my address book and got that worry off my mind. Later in the day, another cell phone came to my rescue as my neighbor took hers into my apartment and I directed her from room to room, telling her where to find things I needed.</p>
        <p>RETTA BLANEY</p>
        <p>While on the subject of cell phones: Judith Nochimson Stein was on a Wall Street-bound subway on a weekday when it stopped for almost an hour because of a fire in the station ahead. After 45 minutes, as the passengers sat frustrated and restless, fretting about missed appointments and irate employers, a lone entrepreneur made his way through the cars yelling, ballpark style: ''Call your offices, call your families. One dollar a minute on my cell phone.'' He wasn't discouraged when Mrs. Stein's car produced smiles but no takers. He just went on to the next.</p>
        <p>R. Michael Wirin parked on 36th Street recently, and when he returned a few hours later, his one-touch ''keyless'' keyholder wouldn't open his car. After thinking of paying a streetwise kid to break into the car, or throwing himself on the mercy of a police officer, he hailed a nearby parking attendant, hoping the man wouldn't hold it against him that he hadn't entrusted his car to the lot. The attendant took the clicker in hand and said, ''Empire State Building.'' Mr. Wirin explained that he wasn't a tourist looking for that skyscraper. The attendant scrambled under the car and voila, the locks magically opened as he reappeared and said again, ''Empire State Building.'' At this point, Mr. Wirin asked him to explain. It was common knowledge, the man said, that the huge transmitter atop King Kong's perch often disables electronic devices in the neighborhood.</p>
