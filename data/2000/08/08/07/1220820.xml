        <p>ELECTRONIC mail has become ubiquitous, so it comes as no surprise that independent inventors as well as advertisers and consumer electronics and telecommunications companies are working on new ways to exploit this form of communication.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has ever lost a cell phone, personal digital organizer or a laptop knows how it feels to mislay a device that may contain critical personal or professional information.</p>
        <p>The feeling is even worse if the device is stolen. Now a Japanese inventor has capitalized on wireless technology to patent a method of sending an e-mail to a lost or stolen device that will lock the appliance or erase the data it holds.</p>
        <p>Mikio Hasebe of Gyoda, Japan, has developed a system with which the owner of a wireless-enabled device like a laptop chooses a password and a security response in case anything should happen to the computer. If the laptop is stolen or mislaid, the owner can write the password in the subject line of an e-mail and send it to the device.</p>
        <p>Assuming the computer is operating, or when it is turned on, software in the laptop would then initiate a predetermined security response, either locking the display screen so nothing would appear, showing only the name and contact information of the owner or erasing the laptop's hard drive. Mikio Hasebe won patent 5,987,609 for Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba in Kawasaki, Japan.</p>
        <p>Some people write e-mails online, while others write messages and then log on to send them. Advertisers want to reach both types of Internet users, and now a New York inventor has won a patent for Juno Online Services that would ensure that banner advertisements and other kinds of online ads will run even when a message writer is not online.</p>
        <p>Mark Moraes, of Forest Hills, Queens, created a system by which advertising is downloaded through an e-mail server when a subscriber is online. Later, when the subscriber uses his computer to write e-mails, the commercials that are stored on his system flash across his screen. Mr. Moraes recommends in his patent that the ads be aimed at the individual and frequently changed. When the subscriber logs on to send e-mail and retrieve new messages, the e-mail server would update the advertisements according to a predetermined distribution schedule. The next time the user writes an e-mail, the ads that have already appeared on his screen will have been replaced with new ones. Mr. Moraes won patent 6,014,502.</p>
        <p>Many people receive e-mails with breathless subject lines like ''Available now, millions of CD's!'' ''Make money from home,'' or ''Get Viagra online!'' Most avoid opening such unsolicited promotional e-mail, lest they find their names added to even more junk e-mail lists. But two Japanese inventors, Akira Kamakura and Hideki Tanaka, have patented a method for encouraging people to  read and reply to their junk mail. Their idea is to award bonus points for each answered message. Each piece of junk e-mail would contain an offer of bonus points, and when the recipient replied to the pitch, a database system would transfer points to their name. The bonus points accumulate, and eventually the junk e-mail recipient can redeem them for gifts. The invention belongs to Fujitsu in Kawasaki, Japan, and the inventors received patent 6,076,101.</p>
        <p>A lot of people probably say that the best e-mail enhancement they can imagine is a way to eliminate junk e-mail altogether. A new patent awarded to a San Francisco inventor, Sunil Paul, aims to do that by screening out unsolicited mass promotions. An e-mail address that serves as a probe is planted along a communications network so that it is picked up and included in mass junk electronic mailings -- the sizable ones known as spam. The probe's e-mail boxes are monitored in a control center to look for incoming spam.</p>
        <p>When unsolicited e-mail is found, the system analyzes its origin and creates a signal that informs Internet servers of the spam source. The alert is then forwarded to network servers and user terminals, where filters store the information and then use it to vet e-mail from the spam source. Junk e-mails can either be rejected, delivered but flagged as ''JUNK'' or processed under special instructions from the addressee. Mr. Paul received patent 6,052,709.</p>
        <p>Attachments often accompany e-mail, and many times people find themselves trying to read a document that is not formatted with compatible software. Converting attachments is often time-consuming, and sometimes impossible if the recipient does not have the right programs. Three inventors for Siemens Information and Communications Networks in Boca Raton, Fla., have won a patent for a system that translates the file format of attachments before sending them to the recipient.</p>
        <p>To use the system, a customer would register the format capabilities of his or her computer with a local or remote Internet service provider. When an e-mail with an attachment is directed through the service provider to the customer, the system first compares the attachment's format to the capabilities of the computer to which it is destined. If it sees that the computer cannot  perform the conversion, it will do it instead. The inventors, Shmuel Shaffer, William Beyda and Paul Bonomo, received patent 6,092,114.</p>
        <p>E-mail devotees like to know whether they have new messages even when they are not online. Dan Kikinis, of Saratoga, Calif., won a patent for the DataLink Systems Corporation in San Diego for a paging system embedded in a computer keyboard. When an e-mail is received but the recipient is not online, the server matches the e-mail address to a dial-up paging service. A page is sent to a telephone number that results in an alert like a flashing light on the keyboard, or instructions to the computer to automatically log on and download the e-mail. Mr. Kikinis received patent 6,085,232.</p>
        <p>At AT&amp;T, five inventors have combined voice and e-mail in a patented system that allows subscribers to get both just by looking in their e-mail box. The system converts voice mail into e-mail. The system then converts the voice message into text or a .wav file, formats either one as an e-mail and sends it to the recipient. Sanjay Agraharam, Lee Begeja, Carroll Creswell, Ram Ramamurthy and Sandeep Sibal received patent 6,085,231.</p>
