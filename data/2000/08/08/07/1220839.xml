        <p>Charles Bronfman, the co-chairman of the Seagram Company, which is being sold to Vivendi of France, is considering making a bid for his company's liquor division, home to brands like Absolut vodka, Captain Morgan rum and Chivas Regal scotch.</p>
        <p>Claridge Investments Ltd., Mr. Bronfman's privately held investment group, has retained investment bankers at Bear Stearns to examine a possible bid. Vivendi, a French conglomerate, is building its entertainment and communications operations, but plans to sell the liquor business.</p>
        <p>Several people close to Mr. Bronfman said yesterday that he was still considering how to structure an offer, if indeed he bids at all. However, his grandfather, Samuel, founded Seagram as a liquor company. His nephew, Edgar Bronfman Jr., the chief executive of the company, expanded it into entertainment.</p>
        <p>Vivendi has no interest in the liquor business and wants to shed it to help reduce its about $6.6 billion in debt. Analysts have speculated that the liquor operations could raise more than $7 billion.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, reports have said that Charles Bronfman has hoped that the business will remain family-owned. Phone calls to Claridge and Bear Stearns were not returned yesterday. A spokesman for Seagram declined to comment.</p>
        <p>However, a person informed of the discussions said Charles Bronfman was mulling how to put together a deal, including strategies like joining with Bacardi-Martini, the privately held owner of Bacardi rum, or with the owner of Absolut vodka, to which Seagram already owns the worldwide distribution rights.</p>
        <p>Absolut's distribution deal stipulates that if Seagram is sold, the Swedish distiller, the state-owned Vin and Spirit A.B. of Stockholm, has the right to break its contract. One person speculated that the Bronfmans might have some advantage in a sale because the company and the family already have a relationship.</p>
        <p>Other large liquor companies that could join the bidding are Diageo of Britain, which just sold Pillsbury to General Food for $10.6 billion, prompting analysts to speculate that Diageo was raising money for a bid. Allied Domecq, which owns brands like Beefeater gin and Ballantine's scotch, is also expected to bid.</p>
