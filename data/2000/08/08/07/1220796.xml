        <p>The Journal of the American Medical Association study questioning the effectiveness of the Brady law in reducing homicide rates begins with a flawed premise: that criminals get guns from their own states (news article, Aug. 2).

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Journal of the American Medical Association study questioning the effectiveness of the Brady law in reducing homicide rates begins with a flawed premise: that criminals get guns from their own states (news article, Aug. 2). The study compared the 32 states that installed the Brady law in 1994 with the 18 states that already required buyer background checks and concluded that the law had limited effect.</p>
        <p>But gun-trace data show that a handful of states with weak gun laws are the source of most of the country's out-of-state crime guns. They also show that in states with tough gun laws, like New York and New Jersey, nearly three-fourths of all crime guns were bought in another state and trafficked over state lines illegally.</p>
        <p>Buried in the study is the acknowledgment that loopholes in the Brady law must be eliminated to allow it to work more effectively. If that were the result of this study, I could forgive its shortcomings. But it is more likely to set back the cause of gun control.</p>
