        <p>Four Sundays away from the opening of his rookie season as head coach, Al Groh today virtually proclaimed the Jets' starting receivers a problem-free zone.</p>
        <p>In fact, he said he was hoping someone would ask him about Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward;  both of them produced big performances during last Friday night's 37-24 exhibition loss at Green Bay.</p>
        <p>And after them? Windrell Hayes emerged from the loss likely to be a key player soon. The rookie from Southern California, drafted on the fifth round, snared five passes from Chad Pennington and Ray Lucas. Hayes has also been a summer-camp favorite of Vinny Testaverde.</p>
        <p>Was this game progress for Hayes?</p>
        <p>''It's a start, rather than progress,'' Groh cautioned.</p>
        <p>That was exactly the phrase used by the receivers coach, Todd Haley, who said today that Hayes had delighted everyone in minicamp with his talents. Then Haley set about making Hayes a pro player by teaching him the other part of the receiving game -- blocking.</p>
        <p>''The way I put it to him,'' said Haley, referring to Friday's game, ''was, 'That's a start.' He has to continue that.''</p>
        <p>For Hayes had shown nothing in his first appearance, a week earlier against the Saints. He had no catches, muffed one punt and misplayed another. And yet, in practice he has been more consistent than the heralded third-rounder from Florida State, Laveranues Coles.</p>
        <p>Hayes is a possession receiver, known for his hands. While he was making five catches against the Packers, Coles, the deeper threat, dropped two he should have had.</p>
        <p>''I think Hayes will be a factor in this league,'' Testaverde said. ''He's really a kid I have a lot of interest in because No. 1, he can help this football team, and No. 2, he's a likable kid.'' In today's practice Testaverde drilled a ball over the middle to Hayes, who leaped and caught it in a crowd. It was similar to a catch he made Friday night.</p>
        <p>There was a hint of self-satisfaction in Groh's demeanor today despite the loss to Green Bay. For Groh never really hid his interest in trading Keyshawn Johnson for the right kind of deal. He felt the Jets could still have quality receivers, starting with Chrebet, aided by Ward. That deal surfaced -- a pair of first-round draft picks from Tampa Bay for Johnson -- and then two receivers with good credentials were available in the draft.</p>
        <p>Hayes is part of U.S.C.'s legacy that, he says, is now oriented more to receivers than the runners that used to define the Trojans -- players like O. J. Simpson and Marcus Allen.</p>
        <p>He mentioned former U.S.C. receivers, like the Chargers' Curtis Conway and the Lions' Johnnie Morton.</p>
        <p>''If all things were equal -- and they never are -- I think it's to a player's advantage to come from a program like that,'' Groh suggested. ''But the first two factors will always be attitude and talent.''</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether the Jets will toss Hayes back into the punt-returner mix Saturday night at Baltimore. His unfamiliarity with the job probably led to opening-game troubles that spilled over to his receiving.</p>
        <p>''I never returned punts, not in high school, not even in Pop Warner football,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Groh has no concerns, meanwhile, about a player he speaks more highly of than anyone else on defense -- linebacker Mo Lewis.</p>
        <p>Groh said the possibility that Lewis could be gone after this season will not affect his play.</p>
        <p>''He has worked very hard,'' the coach said. ''He's very detail oriented. Whatever he's doing, he'd work hard -- if he was a pilot he'd be practicing takeoffs and landings.''</p>
        <p>Lewis spoke at length with the news media today, the first time he has done that since he signed his one-year tender offer of $4.18 million. It means he can leave after this season.</p>
        <p>''I am motivated to play to win,'' he said. ''The contract has nothing to do with it.''</p>
        <p>And did he think that time may be running out on winning for him?</p>
        <p>''My window is still there,'' he said.  ''It's still early. Vinny's still coming back.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>SCOTT FROST will get a chance to start at free safety against Baltimore on Saturday, the third starter at the position in three games. ''I felt comfortable back there,'' he said of his play against Green Bay. ''I was around the ball and I made some tackles.'' He also missed one in the open field.</p>
