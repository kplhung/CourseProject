        <p>U.S. Echoes Europeans In a Phone Market Fight  While the European Union contends that opposition by American lawmakers to Deutsche Telekom's $50.7 billion offer for VoiceStream Wireless violates commitments the United States made to the World Trade Organization to keep its telecommunications market open, the United States is making similar arguments against Mexico.</p>
        <p>Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, says there is no doubt that Telefonos de Mexico, the former state-owned monopoly, is thwarting competition and that Mexico is thus not living up to its W.T.O. commitments. New Economy. [Page C5.]</p>
        <p>Government's Business Goes Online  Now that the only Year 2000 disaster has turned out to be the stock prices of dot-com businesses, Internet executives and federal bureaucrats are taking a much closer look at each other. Thanks to the Year 2000 scare, the government is much smarter about information technology systems and processes, and it is directing that knowledge to Internet purchasing efforts. Internet companies, meanwhile, are looking for any market that can deliver revenue and keep their businesses afloat. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. [C13.]</p>

        <p>'Big Brother' Host Seeks Credibility  The appointment of Julie Chen, the news reader on ''The Early Show,'' as a host of the reality program ''Big Brother'' on CBS touched off a renewed debate over whether the lines between network news and entertainment were becoming too blurred. Now, executives close to the program say, Ms. Chen is doing what she can to maintain her stature as a newscaster, fighting with ''Big Brother'' scriptwriters, who have been handing her lines that are hardly the stuff of news people.

        <p>Rival Has Money Manager's Name  Even though Thomas F. Marsico, a money manager at Janus Capital, left three years ago, his domain name has found its way back to his old employer. The name tommarsico.com was registered by James P. Goff, manager of the Janus Enterprise fund. While there have been dust-ups over domain names before, this may be the first to involve two investors who manage billions of dollars. [C2.]</p>

        <p>Newscasts Tailored for Individuals  A handful of Web sites are offering users television-style news reports on the Internet, in digestible bits that can be put together into personalized newscasts. These services are based on the new-media assumptions that consumers want information and entertainment on demand and that high-speed Internet connections can finally give it to them. [C14.]</p>
        <p>The World According to Ice-T  At an industry conference, the rapper Ice-T, a self-described ''conspiracy theorist type of guy,'' shared his views on the recording industry and the controversy over Napster, the service that lets people swap music files over the Internet. ''Napster will resurface in one of these major record companies as a way to share files. Once they figure out how to take the technology and get paid off of it.'' [C5.]</p>
        <p>Bid Considered for Seagram Unit  Charles Bronfman, the uncle of Edgar Bronfman Jr., president of Seagram, is considering a bid for the liquor division of Seagram, the family-controlled company that is being sold to Vivendi of France. [International.]</p>
