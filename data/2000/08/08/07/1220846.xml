        <p>Geopolitics has tainted the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders planned for New York City later this month. The meeting, paid for mainly by private foundations, will be held at the United Nations a week before a similar gathering of world political leaders. It will bring together more than 1,000 religious figures. But under pressure from China, organizers have not invited the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, to attend any of the meetings on the grounds of the U.N. Other attendees and the conference's financial backers should oppose his exclusion.</p>
        <p>China detests the Dalai Lama because he is a symbol of the distinctive Tibetan culture Beijing has been trying to destroy for the past 41 years. China regularly uses its power as a member of the Security Council to block his participation in U.N.-sponsored events. The Dalai Lama has told the conference organizers that they should go ahead without him. But it would be better to take a stand against his unjustifiable exclusion.</p>

        <p>Geopolitics has tainted the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders planned for New York City later this month.

        <p>China detests the Dalai Lama because he is a symbol of the distinctive Tibetan culture Beijing has been trying to destroy for the past 41 years. China regularly uses its power as a member of the Security Council to block his participation in U.N.-sponsored events. The Dalai Lama has told the conference organizers that they should go ahead without him. But it would be better to take a stand against his unjustifiable exclusion.</p>
        <p>Some have already done so. Desmond Tutu, the retired archbishop of Cape Town and himself a Nobel Peace laureate, has urged the U.N. secretary general, Kofi Annan, to invite the Dalai Lama to the conference. So have Representatives Tom Lantos and John Edward Porter, co-chairmen of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus.</p>
        <p>The conference's chief financial underwriter, Ted Turner, and the religious leaders planning to attend should make clear that if the U.N. is not prepared to reverse itself, they will move the conference to another location. A gathering of spiritual and religious leaders for world peace should not have a political admissions test.</p>
