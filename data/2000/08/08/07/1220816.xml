        <p>CBS's announcement earlier this summer that Julie Chen, the news reader on ''The Early Show,'' would be a host on ''Big Brother,'' one of the network's two summer reality programs, sent ripples of anger through the network's news division.</p>
        <p>There was grumbling that it was inappropriate for a news personality like Ms. Chen to participate in ''Big Brother,'' a prime-time game show that is managed by CBS Entertainment. Her appointment to the program kicked off a renewed debate over whether the lines between network news and entertainment were becoming too blurred. Andy Rooney, the ''60 Minutes'' commentator, publicly called her role in the program ''a further deterioration of news standards.''</p>
        <p>Now, executives close to the program say, Ms. Chen is doing what she can to maintain her stature as a newscaster, heatedly fighting with ''Big Brother'' scriptwriters, who have been handing her lines that are hardly the stuff of network news people.</p>
        <p>For instance, after the first episode of ''Big Brother,'' Ms. Chen was heavily criticized by TV critics for uttering the following decidedly un-newsy statement, ''Wow. That was intense.'' Earlier, Ms. Chen had told the audience, ''Wow, that's wild.''</p>
        <p>Though the lines seemed to have been ad-libbed by Ms. Chen, executives revealed that the words were scripted. Ms. Chen, they said, was deeply embarrassed.</p>
        <p>Ever since, they said, she has been engaging in long, tense arguments about scripts with her ''Big Brother'' producer, Michael Horowicz, over lines that she thinks will sully her image. Though Ms. Chen is said to have won some battles -- knocking out the more embarrassing lines -- she has only been able to do so much, and some have remained from week to week.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chen and Mr. Horowicz both declined to comment on the situation.</p>
        <p>''Big Brother'' runs on CBS six nights a week and made its debut in July, when 10 contestants were placed in a house together and put under constant surveillance. Once a week, the contestants nominate one another for elimination or the audience votes one of them out. Ms. Chen is the host of the weekly shows and interviews contestants about the week's developments.</p>
        <p>Executives said that to give Ms. Chen more time for those interviews, in which she can to act more like a newscaster, they have eliminated the role of the co-host, Ian O'Malley.</p>
