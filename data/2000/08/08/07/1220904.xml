        <p>Map of Mexico City's 70,000-odd streets, with plethora of esoteric and surreal street names, is like literary masterpiece; many streets have same names, and guide reads as if mapmakers translated encyclopedia, cut work into confetti and sprinkled it over city; maps; photo (M)</p>

        <p>The map of one of the world's largest metropolises is a kind of literary masterpiece. The street guide reads as if a writer from the school of magical realism had translated the encyclopedia, cut his work into confetti and sprinkled it over the city.</p>
        <p>This is not a place where people live on 88th and Third, as in Manhattan, or 35th and P, as in Washington. This is a place where people live on Heart and on Soul. They live on Forest of Light, Mirror of Water, Forest of Miracles, Garden of Memories, Tree of Fire, Forest of Secrets, Sea of Dreams. Surreal street names can reflect hard realities. Work is long. Love and Happiness are short. Good Luck crosses Hope, then hits a dead end. Intersections become works of imagination: the Volga River flows into the Nile, Beethoven meets Bach, the Himalayas cross the Alps.</p>

        <p>The map of one of the world's largest metropolises is a kind of literary masterpiece. The street guide reads as if a writer from the school of magical realism had translated the encyclopedia, cut his work into confetti and sprinkled it over the city.</p>
        <p>This is not a place where people live on 88th and Third, as in Manhattan, or 35th and P, as in Washington. This is a place where people live on Heart and on Soul. They live on Forest of Light, Mirror of Water, Forest of Miracles, Garden of Memories, Tree of Fire, Forest of Secrets, Sea of Dreams. Surreal street names can reflect hard realities. Work is long. Love and Happiness are short. Good Luck crosses Hope, then hits a dead end. Intersections become works of imagination: the Volga River flows into the Nile, Beethoven meets Bach, the Himalayas cross the Alps.</p>
        <p>And Comprehension ends in Silence.</p>
        <p>Fewer than one million people lived here at the turn of the 20th century; almost 20 million at the turn of the 21st. With the city endlessly overflowing, the city fathers long ago ran out of dead presidents, revolutionary heroes and military battles to use as names for their streets, avenues and boulevards. One result, noted in these pages before, is that the street guide has more than 100 listings of places named for Benito Juarez, father of his country. There are also more than 200 named for Venustiano Carranza, progenitor of Mexico's Constitution, and nearly 300 for Lazaro Cardenas, arguably its greatest president. Asked for directions, citizens may react like the scarecrow in ''The Wizard of Oz'' when Dorothy asked which way to the Emerald City, pointing in two directions at once.</p>
        <p>It is not the sheer number of streets named the same that overwhelms the senses, but the sheer magic in so many of the names among the 70,000-odd streets. The city mapmakers have persevered with an endurance perhaps more poetic than practical. But they must be near their wits' end.</p>
        <p>They have exhausted the names of the world's great landmarks; drained the lexicon of oceans and seas, rivers and lakes; paid tribute to all the gods and goddesses, the birds and flowers, the colors of the palette, the signs of the zodiac, the names of the saints, the better-known stars and constellations.</p>
        <p>The major arts, crafts and sciences are taken and the minor ones are going fast. Other capitals , conceivably, might also have a boulevard dedicated to Bacteriology or Beekeeping. Mexico City also has Cardiology Street and Astronomy Street, Orthodontist Street and Hairdressers Street, Publicists Street and Biographers Street. Significantly, the street dedicated to authors of fiction is not a street, but Novelists Circle.</p>
        <p>Let Paris have its sidewalk semioticians. Mexico City may be the only place in the world dedicated to a school of literary criticism: Structural Analysis Street.</p>
        <p>Mexico's calendar is full of holidays and dates of historical significance. So is its capital: there are streets named for the fifth day of January, February, March, May, June, July, September, October, November and December. The fifth of May, the anniversary of Mexico's victory in 1862 over French forces, has a special place. Many, actually.</p>
        <p>More than 200 streets with the name Cinco de Mayo are listed. There are more than 100 streets named for days of the year, giving a newcomer a nearly one-in-three chance of choosing an address matching her birthday.</p>
        <p>Like a sprawling sidewalk market, the streets are full of food.</p>
        <p>There is a Squid Street and a Shrimp Street and, for better or worse, a Tuna Fish Street. There is Avocado Street, Onion Street and Cilantro Street. Corn Street, Rice Street and Bean Street are here, but, surprisingly, Mexico City has no Chicken Street (although Kabul, Afghanistan, does). There are streets named Fountain of Hope , Fountain of Light and Fountain of Happiness, of course, but there is also the somewhat hallucinatory Fountain of Mushrooms.</p>
        <p>Mindful of its place as a world city, the capital has christened streets in the name of Greek Culture, Roman  Culture, Mexican Culture, Aztec Culture, Mayan Culture, Physical Culture and just plain Culture, along with World Cinema Street, Mexican Cinema Street and a generic Cinema Street. Social Action Street and Public Assistance Street stand for civic virtues, although National Unity Street dead-ends.</p>
        <p>Whole neighborhoods are dedicated to canonic writers and composers, scientists and philosophers. One can stand on the corner of Tolstoy and Dante, Dickens and Moliere, Verdi and Wagner, Socrates and Homer, Shakespeare and Darwin, imagining the conversations.</p>
        <p>There are many such serendipities. But in a place this big and complicated, there are bound to be jarring collisions and dissonances.</p>
        <p>There are 21 streets named Peace, but 18 named High Tension (after public utilities, not private miseries). Democracy, Justice and Human Rights Streets are in a tough neighborhood. Panama Canal is barely 100 meters long, but 100 Meters Avenue runs nearly a mile.</p>
        <p>Mexico City's respect for the past sometimes passes understanding. Russia has liquidated the memory of its worst dictators. But when Mexico City taxicab meters, which sometimes malfunction, usually in the driver's favor, break down completely, they are repaired on Stalin Street. Stalin lies a block away from Trotsky, though his henchmen assassinated Trotsky in Mexico City some 60 years ago. By no coincidence, Siberia Street is four blocks away.</p>
        <p>Some names have been clearly conceived. There is a Nafta Street, in a neighborhood called Plentitude. Obscurity Street runs hopefully into Tomorrow Avenue. Others seem intended to drive mailmen mad. In one suburban neighborhood, there are two different streets named for the same Islamic republic. One is Pakistan. The other is Paquistan. Then there are the names in Nahuatl, the language of the people who were here before the conquistadors, which sound like music from another planet: Panquetzaliztli, Cetlaltepetl, Ixtlememelixtle.</p>
        <p>But in cities as in science, mind-bending complexity can contain beautiful simplicity. A great green park stands near the heart of this urban beast. An avenue graced by Art Deco buildings circles this park. And the people who live there have an unforgettable address: Mexico Avenue, Mexico City, Mexico.</p>
