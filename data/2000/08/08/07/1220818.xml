        <p>One has to admire Santa Fe Opera's willingness to gamble. After all, in an eight-week season offering only five productions, every questionably bankable show accounts for a significant portion of the schedule. This summer the company is staging two high-risk works, the American premiere of Hans Werner Henze's ''Venus and Adonis'' and Rossini's ''Ermione,'' a rarity that lay unperformed from its 1819 premiere until its modern revival in 1987. A third work, Strauss's ''Elektra,'' though not uncommon, is well down the operatic hit parade.</p>
        <p>The Henze and Rossini works have a constituency among opera obsessives who travel the world in search of fresh works and are the majority of the Santa Fe audience. And ''Elektra'' draws admirers of the estimable Strauss tradition established here by John Crosby, the company's founder and general director. But these constituencies are not huge: only this season's bread-and-butter offerings, Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' and Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' are sold out.</p>

        <p>One has to admire Santa Fe Opera's willingness to gamble. After all, in an eight-week season offering only five productions, every questionably bankable show accounts for a significant portion of the schedule. This summer the company is staging two high-risk works, the American premiere of Hans Werner Henze's ''Venus and Adonis'' and Rossini's ''Ermione,'' a rarity that lay unperformed from its 1819 premiere until its modern revival in 1987. A third work, Strauss's ''Elektra,'' though not uncommon, is well down the operatic hit parade.</p>
        <p>The Henze and Rossini works have a constituency among opera obsessives who travel the world in search of fresh works and are the majority of the Santa Fe audience. And ''Elektra'' draws admirers of the estimable Strauss tradition established here by John Crosby, the company's founder and general director. But these constituencies are not huge: only this season's bread-and-butter offerings, Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' and Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' are sold out.</p>
        <p>For ''Ermione,'' the company enlisted Jonathan Miller to direct, and he transported the piece from the Trojan War era to the American South just after the Civil War. It is difficult to imagine what in this work suggested such a peculiar, historically incongruous move. Perhaps the idea was picked out of a hat.</p>
        <p>In this operatic reduction of Racine's ''Andromaque,'' Pyrrhus, the Greek ruler of defeated Troy, has resolved to dump his wife, Hermione (Ermione), in favor of the Trojan princess Andromache, Hector's widow. She considers the offer only as a way to save her son Astyanax, the heir to the Trojan throne. Orestes, sent by Greece to demand Astyanax's execution, mostly pants after Hermione, who dispatches him to murder Pyrrhus and then excoriates him for doing so when she has a belated change of heart.</p>
        <p>A few trenchant moments are scattered through the two-and-a-half-hour work, but ''Ermione'' is mostly Rossinian boilerplate: chirpy tunes with scant connection to the words being sung, much less the emotions they evoke, and plenty of florid stuntwork for the soloists. That puts a heavy burden on the soloists: not only must they have the range and agility to meet the music's demands, but they must sing thrillingly enough to make the work's vacuousness seem beside the point. The Santa Fe cast worked valiantly on Thursday evening, with inconsistent results.</p>
        <p>In the title role, Alexandrina Pendatchanska wobbled shrilly through the first act, but after the intermission she settled into the role sufficiently to give an admirably ornamented account of Hermione's final scenes. Barry Banks's Orestes was a bit overwrought and his timbre veered on reediness. But he has the power and range for this music, and a taste for bel canto heroics.</p>
        <p>There was also much to admire in Sara Mingardo's vocally dark-hued and dramatically dignified portrayal of Andromache. But Gregory Kunde was an awkward Pyrrhus, stretched well beyond his limits.</p>
        <p>The orchestra, conducted by Evelino Pido, seemed to be having fun with the music, even after Mr. Pido toned it down enough to let the singers be heard.</p>
        <p>Orestes reappears in ''Elektra,'' this time to avenge the death of his father, Agamemnon, by slaughtering his guilty mother, Clytemnestra, and her new husband, Aegisthus. The Strauss work, heard on Friday, is being offered in a strikingly direct production by Mr. Copley. The set, by Bruno Schwengl, is the courtyard of Aegisthus's palace, littered with fragments of a fallen statue of Agamemnon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwengl's costumes mirror the spirit of the characters: black for Elektra, light, muted colors for Chrysothemis, a blaze of red for Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, and cool blue armor for Orestes. More crucially, the production has a uniformly strong cast. As Elektra, Mary Jane Johnson was the picture of madness about to break loose, but under control for the moment. She was undaunted by either the acrobatics or the virtually unrelieved intensity of Strauss's vocal line, and in its best moments, her performance was hair-raising.</p>
        <p>Susan B. Anthony's Chrysothemis was paler dramatically, but she sang with a power and range that matched Ms. Johnson's. Judith Forst played up Clytemnestra's malevolence and magnified her decrepitude, but was also equal to the considerable vocal demands of the short role. And Greer Grimsley's sonorous bass was perfectly suited to the patiently vengeful Orestes.</p>
        <p>The company's championship of the Strauss operas, nearly all of which have been played here, has its roots in Mr. Crosby's fascination with the composer, and the company's tradition is that when Strauss is on the stage, Mr. Crosby is in the pit. His devotion to this music and his deep knowledge of it were clearly a motivating force, and the orchestra responded with the lush string textures, burnished brass sound and, most important, the carefully modulated tension that ''Elektra'' requires.</p>
