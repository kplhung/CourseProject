        <p>Politically, Texas is caught in crossfire because our governor, George W. Bush, is running for president. Every shortcoming, real or imagined, has been cited by his detractors as proof of government failure or a heartless culture. Despite Governor Bush's warning in his nomination speech on Thursday not to ''mess with Texas,'' the broadsides will continue because of the way America elects presidents. A majority of Texans will be voting for Mr. Bush, and the Electoral College will issue no transferable credits to Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Even if I didn't understand the politics of it all, the Texan in me cares very little about whether others approve of us. If to be different is to be criticized, bring it on. My deepest concern is that someday we won't be different, that creeping suburbanization will dilute a spirit based on perseverance and personal integrity.</p>

        <p>Politically, Texas is caught in crossfire because our governor, George W. Bush, is running for president. Every shortcoming, real or imagined, has been cited by his detractors as proof of government failure or a heartless culture. Despite Governor Bush's warning in his nomination speech on Thursday not to ''mess with Texas,'' the broadsides will continue because of the way America elects presidents. A majority of Texans will be voting for Mr. Bush, and the Electoral College will issue no transferable credits to Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Even if I didn't understand the politics of it all, the Texan in me cares very little about whether others approve of us. If to be different is to be criticized, bring it on. My deepest concern is that someday we won't be different, that creeping suburbanization will dilute a spirit based on perseverance and personal integrity.</p>
        <p>I am no shill for the Bush campaign; Mr. Bush replaced me as chairman of a state agency after his first election and openly campaigned against me in 1998, when I ran for state comptroller and was the state's leading Democratic vote-getter. But I appreciate what is different about Texas, and it boils down to this: In our view freedom is so intertwined with individual risk that the two are almost indistinguishable at the core.</p>
        <p>In my experience, many other places don't admire risk-taking, but only the successes it may bring. Here, we admire boldness and optimism even in failure, because real freedom has to include the freedom to fail.</p>
        <p>As a progressive, I think government can work, can inspire, and should help those who are deserving; but as a Texan, I strongly resent the presumption of a bureaucracy that meddles in everyone's life instead of focusing on the few bad actors who live outside the social contract.</p>
        <p>Rugged individualism hasn't always served us well. We have been slow to embrace collective notions like environmental planning, lackluster in our commitment to public education and uneven in our efforts to heal racial discrimination. But our way is still closer to the American ideal.</p>
        <p>As good an example as any is the story of my family's visits to our nation's beaches. Massachusetts made us take a life preserver off our son because the government had decided that devices to keep children from sinking can lead to overconfidence. California said we could not throw a Frisbee or roast marshmallows without permission. Florida said we needed a permit for our dog before we could throw a ball to him.</p>
        <p>In Texas, all our beaches are the property of people to enjoy with an absolute minimum of ''mother-may-I.'' We welcome all of those from elsewhere, but they can't expect the authorities to guard them against every ripple of risk and every chance that someone might behave badly.</p>
        <p>This attitude goes well beyond beaches. By careful design, we allow our legislature to convene only for four and a half months every other year because the tendency of collective bodies is to create process. And each little piece of process is a razor cut bleeding away individual freedom.</p>
        <p>Texas has some internal issues to address, but we don't need a more expansive view of government to be mainstream American. Jefferson didn't write the Declaration of Independence, and Washington didn't cross the Delaware, so we could create a government to protect us from ourselves.</p>
