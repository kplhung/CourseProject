        <p>She is tied with the speedskater Bonnie Blair for most Olympic gold medals won by an American woman -- five -- but Jenny Thompson's swimming career carries the slight whiff of unfulfillment. This sense of incompletion is barely perceptible, but it hovers about the pool, wafting like a trace of chlorine.</p>
        <p>The Winter and Summer Games have always celebrated individual achievement over team accomplishment, and all of Thompson's gold medals have come in relay events. So, at 27, she will enter her fourth Olympic swimming trials, which begin Wednesday in Indianapolis. It is not a singular medal itself she is chasing next month at the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, or rather not the gold-plated hardware, but instead a sense of goals achieved, potential consummated.</p>
        <p>''It's important to me, because I feel I'm capable of doing it,'' Thompson said. ''If this is my last Olympics, I can know that I'm ending the closest I can get to my potential.'' She added: ''If I stopped now, I would feel disappointed, not because I didn't get a gold medal, but because I didn't try. I feel I owe it to myself.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps her career will follow the same arc as that of Pablo Morales, the world record-holder who failed to make the United States team in 1988 and won the 100-meter butterfly in 1992. Except Thompson has five gold medals. Still, she feels some small inadequacy, one gold medal lost in what surely was an undetected Chinese doping scandal, another missed because she found herself trapped in an undertow of nerves and stress.</p>
        <p>Four months before the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, Thompson set a world record in the 100-meter freestyle, becoming the first swimmer outside East Germany to set a world mark in the event in two decades. At the Barcelona Games, though, Thompson finished second to Zhuang Yong of China. ''Zhuang immediately became the focus of a growing suspicion that the Chinese women swimmers were taking steroids and other prohibited substances,'' David Wallechinsky wrote in ''The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics. ''With her deep voice, heavy muscles and bad acne, she fit the profile of a steroid user.''</p>
        <p>Many athletes and coaches also became incensed that all medalists, including Zhuang, were not being tested for drugs after swimming events, as they were in other sports. Thompson voiced her concerns, and like Shirley Babashoff before her, she was criticized for fermenting her skepticism into sour grapes. But, just as Babashoff had been right about the East Germans in the 1970's, Thompson was correct about the Chinese.</p>
        <p>More than 30 female Chinese swimmers have been caught cheating in the last decade, including Yuan Yuan, who was found with 13 vials of human growth hormone in her luggage at the 1998 world championships in Perth, Australia. China has vowed to crack down on drug cheats, and its female swimmers have lost their dominance. Last month Wu Yanyan, the 200-meter individual medley world champion, was removed from China's training camp for the Sydney Games after testing positive for a muscle-building steroid.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't have said what I said if I didn't think it was accurate,'' Thompson said. ''I don't mind being criticized if I'm saying what I feel.''</p>
        <p>Last week, the medical commission of the International Olympic Committee approved testing for EPO, an endurance drug believed to be widely used in swimming. But there will be no test for human growth hormone, a steroid, and other banned substances in Sydney. Thompson continues to question the desire of Olympic officials to catch drug cheats.</p>
        <p>Women's swimming, perhaps more than any other Olympic sport, has been tarnished by the specter of drugs. Every East German performance from 1968 through 1988 -- including all 32 gold medals -- has been discredited by revelations in court of the country's state-sponsored system of doping. Cheating by the Chinese has been thoroughly documented, and suspicions about three gold medals won by the Irish swimmer Michelle Smith at the 1996 Atlanta Games gained credence last year when she was banned for spiking a drug test with alcohol.</p>
        <p>''I feel there could be a test for growth hormone,'' Thompson said. ''It makes me angry. The drug is being abused. The technology is there for a test, but I.O.C. officials are worried about looking bad. If there is a test and 50 percent of the athletes test positive, it makes the I.O.C. look really bad.''</p>
        <p>Four years ago at the Olympic trials, Thompson created problems of her own doing. On opening day, she finished third in the 100-meter freestyle -- only two swimmers qualify in each event -- and she began suffering from insomnia and self-doubt. The trials spiraled into the worst meet of her career, and she did not qualify in any single event for the Atlanta Games. She won three relay gold medals in Atlanta, but individual gold remained elusive.</p>
        <p>''I think the media pressure was getting to me,'' Thompson said. ''I was putting too much pressure on myself. I was worried about my competitors. I wasn't being myself. I wasn't enjoying the sport.''</p>
        <p>Thompson began to reassess her career, realizing that she was too serious and obsessed, narrowed by a kind of tunnel vision that left her with little besides swimming. ''Winning was the only important thing,'' she said. ''I really wanted to kill my competitors.''</p>
        <p>Since Atlanta, she said, she recovered a joy that she experienced as a child in Dover, N.H., swimming because she loved to be in the water and to race with her friends and to do frivolous things, like eating Jell-O from a box. That childlike joy is leavened by a wider world view. Swimming is no longer the only thing in her life. A 1995 graduate of Stanford, Thompson has been accepted into medical school at Columbia University, which she plans to enter next August.</p>
        <p>''If I had had the dream Olympics I wanted to have in Atlanta, I wouldn't be here,'' Thompson said of the trials. ''I think, in a large way, it was a blessing. I learned so much about myself and my swimming.'' She added: ''I've never lost the desire to win a race, but I do see it with a different perspective. Now I have much more joy. I enjoy the whole process, the crowds, the kids, my teammates cheering.''</p>
        <p>And she has been swimming faster than ever, using weight training, yoga and stretching exercises to increase her strength and flexibility. Last year Thompson set a world record in the 100-meter butterfly, 57.88 seconds, breaking a mark by Mary T. Meagher that had stood for 18 years. Last month Thompson broke her own American record in the 100 freestyle in 54.27, set a personal best of 1 minute 59.49 seconds in the 200 freestyle and came within two-hundredths of a second of her best in the 50 freestyle, 25.20.</p>
        <p>At the trials, Thompson will wear a version of the so-called Fastskin bodysuit made by Speedo, which mimics sharkskin and decreases drag in the water. A number of world records have been set in similar suits this year. American officials banned the suits from the trials, saying they were not available to everyone, then reversed themselves after one manufacturer threatened to file a grievance. Thompson said she would wear a version that covers her legs but not her arms.</p>
        <p>''I feel my legs are raised higher in the water; it doesn't take as much energy to stay afloat,'' the 5-foot-10-inch, 160-pound Thompson said. ''I'm a densely muscular person. With the suit, it's easier. It streamlines the body so it can flow through water easier. It's like control-top pantyhose.''</p>
        <p>Still, winning an individual gold medal may not be any easier in Sydney than it was in Barcelona and Atlanta. Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands has set blistering records in the 50 and 100 freestyle this year and has twice lowered the 100 butterfly record. It stands now at 56.64, a stunning 1.2 seconds below Thompson's old mark, bringing inevitable public suspicion about doping, which de Bruijn has vehemently denied. The old Jenny Thompson might have become bitter, unnerved. The new one has not, she said.</p>
        <p>''Whether I feel her times are skeptical is irrelevant,'' Thompson said. ''They are real world records. I don't feel like they're impossible times for me to do. They are real times for me to shoot for and surpass.''</p>
        <p>This is the race she really wants in Sydney, the 100 butterfly, perhaps to break yet again a record that was once considered unbreakable. There could be no greater validation of her longevity and perseverance.</p>
        <p>''I'm really motivated, this being the end of the road and wanting to live up to my potential,'' Thompson said. ''An Olympic gold medal would be nice.''</p>
