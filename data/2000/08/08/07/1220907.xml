        <p>Dick Cheney repeated his promise of a ''tough fight'' to ''restore honor, integrity and decency to the Oval Office.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, acknowledged in an interview that House Republicans bore some responsibility for the ''partisan bickering and backbiting'' in Washington that he criticizes in his speeches.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, the second-ranking House Republican until he became defense secretary in 1989 under President George Bush, also denied waging a specific offensive against President Clinton.</p>
        <p>''We've made it clear what we want to bring to the White House,'' he said. ''If it implies any criticism of the Clinton administration, that's their problem, not ours.''</p>
