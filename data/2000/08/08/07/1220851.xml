        <p>Whenever George W. Bush talks about his achievements as governor of Texas, the item at the top of his list is education reform, especially the remarkable improvement in test scores by the state's public school students.</p>
        <p>In his acceptance speech Thursday night, he told the party's delegates, ''We improved our schools dramatically, for children of every accent, of every background.''</p>
        <p>His wife, Laura, in her address to the convention last Monday, said, ''The highly respected nonpartisan Rand study released just last week found that education reforms in Texas have resulted in some of the highest achievement gains in the country among all racial, socioeconomic and family backgrounds.''</p>
        <p>That happened, she said, ''because George led the way'' by focusing state money and the attention of the schools on reading.</p>
        <p>Well, not exactly. George W. has done some nice work with the school system in Texas, but he can't legitimately claim much of the credit for the gains documented by the Rand study. The dramatic improvements in the public schools in Texas were the result of years of hard work and big spending that not only predated Mr. Bush, but were inspired and organized by none other than H. Ross Perot.</p>
        <p>The Rand Corporation study was a state by state analysis of scores from standardized tests that were given in math and reading from 1990 through 1996. The study found that the most important components in raising student achievement appeared to be smaller class sizes in early grades, widespread access to prekindergarten classes and improved classroom working conditions for teachers.</p>
        <p>The study compared scores from one state to another by students from similar socioeconomic backgrounds and found that youngsters in Texas did especially well. ''Texas,'' the report said, ''was in the highest group of states and California in the lowest on scores for students from similar families.''</p>
        <p>The problem with George Bush taking credit for this achievement in the years 1990 through 1996 is that he did not become governor until 1995. And, as the authors of the report have made clear, it takes several years for students to realize the benefits from the kinds of reforms in place in Texas. Improved test scores in the fourth and eighth grades, for example, come from students who were part of the reform effort when they started school.</p>
        <p>The gains in Texas were no accident. When Mark White was governor back in the 1980's, he got Ross Perot to lead an educational reform effort that led to both smaller classes and the most extensive public school prekindergarten program in the nation. This was no altruistic initiative. It was in response to a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot's effort also led to a re-allocation of school spending, with more money being used for disadvantaged students. Thanks to Mr.  White and Mr. Perot, Texas found itself approaching the vanguard of education reform. When Ann Richards was governor in the early 90's, she expanded the original effort and offered some new initiatives.</p>
        <p>While George W. Bush had little or nothing to do with the gains reported in the Rand study, he has maintained his state's focus on education reform. He was responsible for a reading initiative that is widely admired and he has not undermined the reforms he inherited.</p>
        <p>The problem for Mr. Bush, if he is thinking about the improvements he could bring to public schools nationwide if he becomes president, is the fact that both he and his party are opposed to federal assistance for the very programs that have meant so much in Texas -- smaller class size and prekindergarten programs.</p>
        <p>David Grissmer, the lead author of the Rand study, believes substantial help from the federal government is essential. He noted that after adjustments for inflation, some states spend as much as $9,000 per pupil per year, while others spend as little as $4,000.</p>
        <p>You can't have smaller classes in the early grades, and expanded pre school, and more classroom tools for teachers without an infusion of additional resources from somewhere.</p>
        <p>The federal government, in this era of plenty, could lend a much-needed hand to school systems across the country. To get that done, Mr. Bush and the Republicans would have to do a pretty neat philosophical shift.</p>
