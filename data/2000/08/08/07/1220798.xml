        <p>The Lawyers' Orchestra, which you mention, holds frequent public chamber music concerts. These are presented at its home, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, and to private parties and special events. This is in addition to the full orchestra's concerts, which are also presented at nursing homes and hospitals in keeping with our public service ''musical mission.''</p>

        <p>We have found that the musical skills that are important in small ensemble playing are invaluable in the larger orchestral context and have fostered camaraderie and enhanced musicianship among our members.</p>

        <p>The writer, a lawyer and flutist, is the manager of the Lawyers' Orchestra.</p>
