        <p>Thomas F. Marsico was a star money manager at Janus Capital before he left three years ago to form his own company. But his name, it seems, has found its way back to his old employer. Or at least his domain name.</p>
        <p>Last week, a Web site called Fund Alarm.com disclosed that Janus, the nation's fifth-largest mutual fund manager, had registered the domain name tommarsico.com. Actually, the name was registered by James P. Goff, manager of the $8.7 billion Janus Enterprise fund. Mr. Goff, 36, said he registered it on his own last December and not on behalf of Janus.</p>

        <p>Thomas F. Marsico was a star money manager at Janus Capital before he left three years ago to form his own company. But his name, it seems, has found its way back to his old employer. Or at least his domain name.</p>
        <p>Last week, a Web site called Fund Alarm.com disclosed that Janus, the nation's fifth-largest mutual fund manager, had registered the domain name tommarsico.com. Actually, the name was registered by James P. Goff, manager of the $8.7 billion Janus Enterprise fund. Mr. Goff, 36, said he registered it on his own last December and not on behalf of Janus.</p>
        <p>While there have been plenty of dust-ups over domain names before, this may be the first to involve two prominent investors who manage billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>''We were big shareholders of Network Solutions,'' Mr. Goff explained, referring to the Internet company that until last year controlled the registry of domain names.</p>
        <p>''I got on there and got jimgoff.com,'' he said. ''Just for kicks, I looked up Tom's and was surprised they hadn't reserved it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marsico, the 45-year-old chairman and chief executive of Marsico Capital Management, which manages more than $15 billion, said he was not aware the domain name had been registered until last week. He was not amused.</p>
        <p>''When people go out and buy domain names like that, they're usually trying to do it for some benefit, selling it for a higher price,'' he said. ''I was dumbfounded.''</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's, Mr. Marsico managed the Janus Twenty fund and was one of the industry's most prominent fund managers, appearing frequently on the covers of financial magazines. He also helped recruit talent to the firm, including Mr. Goff. The two men both worked previously for Fred Alger Management, a New York investment firm.</p>
        <p>Since his departure from Janus, Mr. Marsico has said little about the firm. Of late, he and his former colleagues have had plenty on their minds.</p>
        <p>In July, Bank of America bought the half of Marsico Capital Management that it did not already own for a total price of $1.1 billion.</p>
        <p>Janus, meanwhile, lost a bitter dispute with its corporate parent, Kansas City Southern Industries, which spun off Janus as an entity called Stilwell Financial, over the objections of Janus executives.</p>
        <p>What will be the fate of tom marsico.com?</p>
        <p>The World Intellectual Property Organization has ruled against several companies that operated registered Web addresses incorporating the names of Yahoo, AT&amp;T and Microsoft. But the Marsico case seems more likely to be settled on the golf course.</p>
        <p>The two men, who both belong to the same Denver-area country club, met by chance last Wednesday. Mr. Goff said he apologized and offered to return the domain name for free.</p>
        <p>''I did it for fun and it was a bad decision,'' Mr. Goff said, adding that he had never set up any Web site at the address.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marsico was skeptical of Mr. Goff's explanation: ''This is a guy who I brought to Janus. I got him into a country club he lives right on. He doesn't say, 'It's nice you sold your business, congratulations.' It was, 'By the way, since The New York Times called me, I bought your domain name.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marsico did once try to register marsico.com, but he said it had already been taken by a Pittsburgh company.</p>
        <p>''There's a man named Marsico there,'' he explained. Marsico Capital uses the address marsicofunds.com as its home.</p>
        <p>As for tommarsico.com, Mr. Marsico said it had never occurred to him to register the name.</p>
        <p>Will he take up Mr. Goff's offer and claim the site? When Mr. Goff approached Mr. Marsico in a buffet line at the golf club, Mr. Marsico said he was more interested in hitting the links than hearing about a domain name.</p>
        <p>''I think I'm protected,'' he said. ''If I ever wanted my name, I could get it.''</p>
