      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In November 1998, ABC News struck gold: Monica S. Lewinsky, after flirting with other news organizations, agreed to give her first interview to Barbara Walters.</p>
        <p>After announcing the coup, Ms. Walters and ABC News repeatedly stated that they had not paid Ms. Lewinsky for the interview.</p>
        <p>But that does not mean that the interview did not cost ABC News. The organization paid Theodore Olson, a Washington lawyer, to help it ''secure access to Lewinsky,'' says a profile of David Westin, the ABC News president, in the issue of The New Yorker that is out today.</p>
        <p>ABC needed help from the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr. The interview with Ms. Lewinsky was delayed for months because of Ms. Lewinsky's immunity agreement with the prosecutor. It required Ms. Lewinsky to get permission from Mr. Starr before giving any interviews. Mr. Starr had been withholding that permission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr gave his blessing to the interview in February 1999. The article does not establish whether Mr. Starr gave his permission because of any efforts by Mr. Olson, whom the article describes as a friend of the prosecutor. Mr. Westin told the magazine that the arrangement did not violate the network's policy against paying for interviews since the money was paid to a lawyer, not to Ms. Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, an ABC spokeswoman said Mr. Olson was hired for his ''specialized knowledge and expertise in immunity agreements'' and took issue with what she called the implication that ABC was paying for the interview.</p>
        <p>The New Yorker article has been widely anticipated among executives at all of the major news organizations. In part, that may be because it has been a slow summer in terms of news (yep, that includes the convention), and an even slower one in terms of grist for the network chattering classes.</p>
