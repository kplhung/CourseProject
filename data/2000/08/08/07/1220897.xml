        <p>The Burger King Corporation has named Odiorne Wilde Narraway &amp; Partners in San Francisco to handle a new creative assignment, to introduce a sandwich named XL Deluxe aimed at consumers ages 18 to 34.</p>
        <p>Rob Calderin, vice president for regional marketing at Burger King in Miami, a unit of Diageo P.L.C., described the assignment as a project that would not affect the company's relationship with its agency of record, Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Lowe Lintas handles national and regional creative work for Burger King, with billings estimated at $400 million; trade publications have reported there was some dissatisfaction at Burger King with recent Lowe Lintas work.</p>

        <p>Rob Calderin, vice president for regional marketing at Burger King in Miami, a unit of Diageo P.L.C., described the assignment as a project that would not affect the company's relationship with its agency of record, Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.

        <p>Michael Draznin, a spokesman for Lowe Lintas, referred inquiries to Burger King. Mr. Calderin, when asked why Lowe Lintas was not awarded the assignment, replied, ''We decided that we'd use a local agency whose niche and focus was that targeted market.'' The campaign is beginning in Western states and will be expanded to the company's remaining regional markets in Central, Northeast and Southeast states if deemed successful.</p>
