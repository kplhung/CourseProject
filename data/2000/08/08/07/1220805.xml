        <p>IT used to be that the way America threw around its military might was what perturbed our allies. Now, it seems, it's the way we do business that rankles.</p>
        <p>A perfect example surfaced late last month when Washington got into tiffs with two of the United States' most important trading partners, and very nearly a third, over what could be called the corn syrup corollary.</p>
        <p>This unwritten tenet of United States economic policy goes basically as follows: ''Do as I say, not as I do.''</p>
        <p>The corollary refers specifically to the 1993 negotiations that led to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Worried that sugar produced in Mexico's ancient refineries would flood the United States, an inventive Congress decided to count corn syrup as sugar in determining the level of Mexican sugar exports that would trigger tariffs.</p>
        <p>This verbal alchemy came at a time when President Clinton was badgering Mexico to drop its own trade barriers. Mexico's economy is one-twentieth the size of America's, and Mexicans resented what they saw as pure protectionist posturing. But they felt they had no choice but to enter Nafta. The United States sugar lobby was happy, even though as recently as this month it has continued to lobby against Mexican exports.</p>
        <p>The corn-syrup-for-sugar swap set a pattern that has dismayed allies and trading partners alike. Consider the European Union, which has been in high dudgeon since late July when the United States Senate threatened to block Deutsche Telekom's $50.7 billion acquisition of a rookie American cellular telephone company, the Voice Stream Wireless Corporation.</p>
        <p>The United States Senate is concerned about Deutsche Telekom's family tree. The German government still owns about 58 percent of the giant telecommunications company, which was totally state controlled until 1996. Several key senators worry that any company even partially owned by a foreign government would have unfair competitive advantages when it comes to raising capital. They also have concerns about national security.</p>
        <p>But the VoiceStream deal would reduce the German government's stake in Deutsche Telekom to 45 percent, and the company says that the government stake will continue to dwindle through subsequent acquisitions or through government sell-off of its shares.</p>
        <p>For their part, the Germans suspect the United States is trying to shield its domestic telecommunications industry. They are backed by their cohort in the European Union, who say that restrictions against Deutsche Telekom violate commitments the United States made to the World Trade Organization a few years ago to keep its telecommunications market open to all. The European Union has threatened to retaliate.</p>
        <p>Riordan Roett, a corporate consultant and director of the Western Hemisphere program at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said the reason for the contradictions in United States economic policy was ''as simple as catering to special interests,'' with little regard to the effect such zigzags have on the nation's trading partners.</p>
        <p>''In their night of nights, in the dark of their dark, they probably understand what they're doing in Washington,'' Professor Roett said. ''On a case-by-case basis, they rationalize this strategy by saying they are defending U.S. interests from the dark forces that come from outside. They say they don't see the contradictions in that position, but they have to.''</p>
        <p>To clear things up, those Beltway insiders probably should take a second look at what happened at the end of the same week sabers were rattled against Deutsche Telekom. A few days later, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, and President Clinton's enforcer on international commerce, took the first steps toward hauling Mexico before the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>The charge? Well, looky here: Failing to live up to commitments Mexico made to the W.T.O. to keep its telecommunications sector open to competition. The same charge, in other words, that the Europeans are making against the United States.</p>
        <p>In this case, it seems clear that Ms. Barshefsky is carrying water for big American telecommunications companies that are fighting for market share in Mexico, while key members of Congress are trying to ward off Deutsche Telekom in the United States market.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T and WorldCom accuse Mexican regulators of being soft on Telefonos de Mexico, which, like Deutsche Telekom, is a former state-owned monopoly. They say that as Mexico's telecommunications sector has been deregulated -- partly because of Nafta -- Telefonos de Mexico continues to dominate the market.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barshefsky said there was no doubt Telmex was thwarting competition by greatly overcharging for connections to the local grid and refusing to provide the high-speed lines that competing companies need to offer Internet services.</p>
        <p>''The situation is intolerable,'' she said rather testily during a conference call with reporters to announce the action against Mexico.</p>
        <p>Mexico now must explain itself before the W.T.O., and if the problems cannot be resolved, Ms. Barshefsky will file a formal complaint against Mexico, which is the United States' second-largest trading partner after Canada.</p>
        <p>Mexico insists it has met all its commitments to the W.T.O. Jorge Nicolin, director of the Federal Telecommunications Commission of Mexico, said Ms. Barshefsky was protecting the interests of American companies, not the principles of free trade.</p>
        <p>In the same week, the United States offended the Europeans and angered the Mexicans, the corn syrup corollary was invoked by yet another United States ally. At a hearing before the subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere of the House Committee on International Relations, Brazil's ambassador reminded United States officials that globalization and free trade were not a one-way street.</p>
        <p>''Reciprocity is the name of the game,'' said Rubens Antonio Barbosa, the ambassador.</p>
        <p>Despite Washington's avowal that free trade is the foundation of prosperity and peace, Mr. Barbosa told the panel, an arsenal of trade barriers impedes the entrance of 80 major Brazilian products -- including sugar, shoes, steel and frozen orange juice -- into the United States.</p>
        <p>The list of American barriers he rattled off is formidable: ''Tariff peaks, retaliatory threats, antidumping and countervailing measures, quotas, safeguards, voluntary restriction agreements, restrictive technical norms, sanitary and phytosanitary measures and increasing domestic subsidies.''</p>
        <p>The ambassador wondered out loud how the United States could defend such a battery of trade restrictions while pushing for the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas by the year 2005.</p>
        <p>The answer, if anyone were willing to give it, would sound a lot like the corn syrup corollary.</p>
