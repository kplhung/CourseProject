        <p>In February, executives at CNN.com made a change to their weather home page that at the time, they said, seemed innocent enough. On a list of cities that allows users to click on a heading to get weather reports around the world, they moved Jerusalem out from under the heading of Israel.</p>
        <p>Users, who once would have found Jerusalem listed with other cities in Israel, now found it standing alone.</p>
        <p>The executives made the move, they said last week, in keeping with their editorial position that Jerusalem is a disputed territory and that to list it as part of Israel would portray CNN.com as taking sides in the debate. ''CNN is a news gathering organization, it does not take editorial stances,'' said Edna Johnson, a spokeswoman for CNN.com.</p>
        <p>But CNN.com changed its stance last week, after it received an angry letter from Phil Baum, executive director of the American Jewish Congress, who wrote that it was exercising ''politically biased news judgment that Jerusalem is now an international city.'' He demanded that the network change its Web site and put Jerusalem back under Israel.</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson said Mr. Baum's letter was followed by a flood of phone calls and e-mail messages making the same demand. ''They saw it as a political statement,'' she said.</p>
        <p>After some internal discussion, CNN changed its Web site again on Thursday, and listed the city as Jerusalem, Israel, once again.</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson said that while the executives at CNN, a unit of Time Warner, were reacting to the political accusations when they made the change, they were also, in part, considering complaints from users who said that by moving Jerusalem out of the Israel section, they had made it hard to find.</p>
        <p>Still, executives have not caved in altogether. The CNN.com weather listing for Jerusalem is marked with an asterisk, which leads users to the following message: ''The status of Jerusalem, the seat of Israeli government, is the most contentious issue in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Palestinian and Arab leaders consider part of Jerusalem the capital of the prospective Palestinian state.''</p>
