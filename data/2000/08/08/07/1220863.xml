        <p>The seedings have yet to be announced, and the sages have yet to weigh in. Even so, with the United States Open set to begin in three weeks, a favorite has emerged among the women. Her name is Venus Williams.</p>
        <p>Williams started her run last month at Wimbledon, of course, with an impressive victory over Lindsay Davenport in the final, and has not slowed down since.</p>
        <p>With her 6-0, 6-7 (3), 6-3 triumph over Monica Seles today in the final of the Acura Classic at the La Costa Resort and Spa, Williams captured her third tournament title and 15th match in a row. Despite 14 double faults in the match and a loss of focus during the second set, the third-seeded Williams continued to serve notice that she can dominate a match against a quality opponent even when she is not at her most formidable. Although she committed 34 unforced errors, she recorded 38 winners, using the powerful ground strokes that have made her so successful.</p>
        <p>For her opponents, there is almost no defense.</p>
        <p>''I didn't play my best tennis,'' said Williams, who, bothered by the sun, had 10 double faults in the second set, ''but on the larger points, I managed to get the points. I'm still winning.''</p>
        <p>Williams, as confident as ever in postmatch remarks, had an explanation for her new level of achievement in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>''I've been working hard, not only when I go home, but when I get to a tournament, I work even harder,'' she said. ''I stay focused. It's all paid off.''</p>
        <p>It certainly paid off in the first set, when Williams rolled past Seles in 18 minutes.</p>
        <p>''I was hitting the ball with some pace,'' Williams said. ''I was hitting it deep.''</p>
        <p>In the second set, Seles picked up her first-serve percentage and came through at several key moments.</p>
        <p>Although she squandered a 5-2 lead, and it appeared as if she might lose the match in two sets, the fourth-seeded Seles played well in the tie breaker -- aided by three double faults from Williams.</p>
        <p>Seles could not maintain the momentum in the deciding set. She rebounded from a service break to record her own, putting the match back on serve at 4-3. But the resilient Williams immediately broke back to seize control once again.</p>
        <p>''That was a key game for me to hold,'' said Seles, who is now 0-3 against Williams. ''If I could replay something, that would be the game. I just missed way too many shots that I make. We both didn't serve that well today.''</p>
        <p>Seles realized she was in trouble from the start.</p>
        <p>''My feet were dead out there,'' said Seles, who has been unable to practice because of a blister on her left hand. ''I felt asleep. I thought I better wake up or it would be over in 20 minutes.''</p>
        <p>Waking up is exactly what Anna Kournikova seems to be doing in time for the United States Open. Although Kournikova was defeated by Seles here in the semifinals Saturday and is still searching for her first tournament victory, her list of conquests at this event included Davenport and Nathalie Tauziat.</p>
        <p>The Open also affords a great opportunity for Williams to assert herself as the game's new premier player.</p>
        <p>She acknowledged today that there are aspects of her game that she still needs to improve. She was unhappy with her footwork in the Seles match, for instance. Before the Open begins, Williams will have an opportunity to work on improvements to her game at the Pilot Pen tournament in New Haven, which begins Aug. 18.</p>
        <p>But she may not need to play any better than she did today. As Seles said, ''The way she's playing now, by far, she's the favorite.''</p>
