        <p>When Tang Weijiang slid a promotional compact disc into his friend's computer last month, what he saw ruined his day, and now he is asking Canon Inc. to pay $12 million in compensation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tang, 29, said he was furious that the Japanese company implied on the disc, which promoted Canon's bubble-jet printers, that China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were three separate countries. He said he suffered mental distress from what he alleged was a deliberate effort by Canon to undermine China's sovereignty.</p>
        <p>Behind what outsiders might see as a quixotic lawsuit is a deeper reason for his reaction: a long-simmering anger toward Japan.</p>
        <p>Despite strong trade ties between the two countries, Japan remains suspect in the eyes of many Chinese because of the Imperial Japanese Army's horrendous behavior in China during the 1930's and 1940's, which included beheading contests and the mass rape and murder of civilians in Nanjing. China estimates that as many as 35 million people died during the Japanese occupation.</p>
        <p>So visceral is China's animosity toward Japan that anything short of demonizing wartime Japan is considered unpatriotic. Many Chinese say openly that they hate the Japanese today, though they do not say so to the Japanese directly.</p>
        <p>The director Jiang Wen has even been criticized for depicting the Japanese too sympathetically in his film ''Devils on the Doorstep,'' which won the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in May but has been banned on the mainland. Devils refers to the Japanese of that period.</p>
        <p>The hostility creates a difficult environment for Japanese companies operating here, even as Chinese are fast embracing Japan's powerful popular culture.</p>
        <p>Even in remote cities, Chinese women teeter on platform shoes and carry Hello Kitty handbags, all icons of Japan. Casio G-Shock and Baby-G watches are the rage among teenagers, and sushi is an increasingly fashionable meal for the sophisticated. But that shallow love affair can evaporate quickly when the Chinese feel slighted.</p>
        <p>During demonstrations at Zhejiang University after NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last year, the mood quickly turned from anti-American to anti-Japanese when a ball being kicked around by a group of Japanese students playing soccer accidentally hit a student banner. The Japanese had to be evacuated by the police.</p>
        <p>And a university in the central city of Wuhan has banned the rental of kimonos and Japanese swords to people posing for pictures beneath blossoming cherry trees planted on campus by Japanese during the war, saying the once-popular practice upsets students and teachers.</p>
        <p>Decades of propaganda have conditioned Chinese to sense slights regarding Taiwan, and the fact that the insult came from a Japanese company only quickened Mr. Tang's vigilance. In Beijing's view, Taiwan is a province of China, and China has an international agreement to prove that Hong Kong, once a British colony, is now a Chinese territory.</p>
        <p>''The company mixed it up intentionally,'' said Mr. Tang, who sells airline tickets in the central Chinese city of Chongqing. ''It hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, and I felt hurt personally.''</p>
        <p>Japan, which has never fully apologized to China for its wartime crimes, maintains a shrine to fallen Japanese soldiers, including seven major war criminals who were hanged.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori said today that he would not make an official visit to the shrine next week on the anniversary of the end of World War II, although he did so last year, but his defense minister will.</p>
        <p>''Japan has never confessed its wrongdoings, from the 1894 Sino-Japanese War to the war in the 1940's, and now it is using another approach to invade -- economic penetration,'' said Lu Lei, Mr. Tang's lawyer, who is also suing Canon after finding similar errors on the company's Web site. ''The country has political goals.''</p>
        <p>The Toshiba Corporation is fighting an anti-Japanese media campaign accusing it of treating Chinese as second-class customers because the company has offered to compensate American buyers of faulty laptops but not Chinese buyers. The American compensation was necessary to avoid a costly legal case.</p>
        <p>Chinese consumers are now also suing Toshiba.</p>
        <p>Canon was quick to issue a recall of the discs that led to the current lawsuit and offered an apology, blaming an editing error.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Tang is unappeased, bolstered by the stone-faced seriousness with which his case has been treated in the press. His vow to spend the $12 million he hopes to win from Canon on schools in impoverished areas of China if he succeeds has made him something of a local hero.</p>
        <p>''We can't accept Canon's apology,'' he said. ''We need Canon to apologize to all Chinese people.''</p>
