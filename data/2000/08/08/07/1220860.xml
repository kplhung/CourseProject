        <p>As commander of the Stamford Police Department's youth division, Sgt. Jon Fontneau handles the grim cases in which children are the perpetrators or the victims of child abuse, sexual assaults, drug abuse or violence, their young lives either terribly wasted or horribly exploited.</p>
        <p>As part of the city's efforts to be in  the vanguard of community policing, he is also in charge of a summer camp.</p>
        <p>The day camp, now in its second year, is attended by 350 middle school children and provides jobs for about 40 high school students as counselors. The majority of the camp's adult staff members are police officers who are assigned during the rest of the year to patrol the city's public schools. Instead of driving a squad car this summer, they are basketball referees, whiffle ball umpires and kickball coaches.</p>
        <p>The S.R.O. Camp, named for the school resource officers who run it, was proposed last year by two Stamford officers, Scott Baldwin and John Jeter, as a way for the police to keep in touch with the city's youth all year. Officer Jeter, who had spent the previous summer visiting other camps to talk about gangs, said he asked the Stamford police chief, Dean M. Esserman, ''Why don't we have the kids come to us?''</p>
        <p>Chief Esserman, a onetime prosecutor who later became a top assistant to William J. Bratton, the former New York City police commissioner, loved the idea. With the support of Mayor Dannel P. Malloy, he used money seized from drug dealers to start the camp, in partnership with the Domus Foundation, a nonprofit community group, and the Stamford public school system. About 100 children signed up.</p>
        <p>''In my heart, I believe this is police work,'' Chief Esserman said, noting that the officers working at the camp are veterans who have served throughout the department, including in narcotics units and on the bomb squad. ''To see police as simply and only enforcers of the law is really to miss the point,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''You want to know the best way to fight crime? Invest in kids. Invest in them before arresting them.''</p>
        <p>The camp is open to all Stamford middle school students, ages 12 to 14. Campers attend at no charge.</p>
        <p>The camp is meant to serve children who are also required to attend summer school and whose parents most likely could not afford to pay for other summer activities. The camp day begins at noon, when summer school classes end, and runs until 5 p.m. Most campers live in inner city neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Without the camp, the campers would probably ''be hanging out at home, doing who knows what,'' Officer Terry Lauf said. She was running up and down a gym floor, keeping score in a basketball game, her badge, gun and handcuffs clipped to the belt on her waist.</p>
        <p>''These kids are having fun,'' Officer Lauf said. ''They are getting exercise and they are learning team sports. By the end of the day, we exhaust them.''</p>
        <p>For its first summer, the camp was in a middle school. This year, officials decided to triple the camp's size and the Board of Education agreed to provide a larger building,  Westhill High School, which has an indoor swimming pool, a large gymnasium and outdoor ball fields at its sprawling campus. The camp also uses classrooms for computer lessons, arts and crafts, and library projects.</p>
        <p>''The thing just exploded this year. It's huge,'' said Mr. Malloy, who has provided administrative assistance for the camp.</p>
        <p>''We have got a great police department filled with men and women who want to work with the community and want to work to make it stronger and safer and better,'' he said. ''Community policing is our sole philosophy of policing.''</p>
        <p>The Domus Foundation, which runs numerous youth programs throughout Stamford, has lent its expertise in running a camp. Michael Duggan, the foundation's executive director, said the camp fit perfectly into efforts by Domus to connect community-based organizations with government agencies and private companies. The camp's initial success has led to further support, including $40,000 this year from the Stamford Housing Authority and $25,000 from the Ruth Brown Foundation, a local charity.</p>
        <p>The beneficiaries are children like Lillian Forbes, 12, who said she would otherwise spend the summer ''doing nothing.'' Instead, she spends the days swimming, playing ball and step-dancing.</p>
        <p>Quentin Foskey, 13, who is now on a first-name basis with the man he calls ''Sergeant Jon,'' said he would have spent the summer just hanging out at Southfield Village, the housing project where he lives. About camp, he said simply: ''I like it.''</p>
        <p>Officer Paul DeRiu said the relationships he has built working at Rippowam Middle School during the year and at camp in the summer had proved immensely valuable on the street. When he is on patrol, he said, ''there's not a day that goes by without a kid coming up and saying hello to me. They kind of get to see the other side of the cop. There's a person behind that badge.''</p>
