        <p>A state prosecutor today expanded the list of accusations against Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a prominent democracy advocate, to include espionage for the United States, his lawyers said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ibrahim, who has been detained since June 30 without being formally charged, is accused of disclosing Egyptian security secrets while speaking at a 1994 conference on Egyptian-American relations.</p>
        <p>Farid al-Deeb, one of his defense lawyers, said the new accusation had been raised in the latest interrogation of Dr. Ibrahim, a sociologist who also holds American citizenship and who has been active in human rights work and election monitoring.</p>
        <p>Spying is the most serious of the complaints brought against him so far and carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p>
        <p>''We are baffled by this new accusation,'' his wife, Barbara Ibrahim, said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>No one in President Hosni Mubarak's government has commented publicly on the case. But Dr. Ibrahim and his supporters have said they believe that the imprisonment is meant to prevent him from monitoring the parliamentary elections scheduled for November.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak's National Democratic Party holds 97 percent of the seats in the People's Assembly. Elections here have usually drawn charges of voter fraud, and the Egyptian Constitutional Court has ruled that the last three parliamentary elections were flawed.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ibrahim's case has drawn considerable attention at a time of rising tensions between Egypt and the United States over the faltering Palestinian-Israeli peace efforts.</p>
        <p>Clinton administration officials have accused Egypt of being uncooperative by not pressing Palestinians to accept an offer on the status of Jerusalem, a charge that officials here vehemently deny.</p>
        <p>In recent days, every government-subsidized newspaper has run editorials attacking President Clinton, accusing him of being biased in favor of Israel and insensitive to Egypt's foreign policy interests.</p>
        <p>The continued detention of Dr. Ibrahim has only worsened the friction. The State Department, questioning Egypt's commitment to human rights, has urged the authorities to clarify the charges against him or release him.</p>
        <p>The State Security Court has twice extended his original 15-day detention. To keep him imprisoned longer without charge, the authorities would have to resort to Egypt's emergency law, which permits detention of up to six months without charge. The law, generally used to detain suspected terrorists and political prisoners, dates from 1981, when President Anwar el-Sadat was assassinated.</p>
        <p>In previous interrogations, his lawyers said, Dr. Ibrahim has been accused of defaming Egypt by producing a get-out-the-vote film, of misusing foreign funds in his social  research organization, of sowing sectarian hatred through his research into Muslim-Christian relations and of having unauthorized contacts with NATO.</p>
        <p>Fifteen employees of Dr. Ibrahim's Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies in Cairo have also been imprisoned without being charged. The center has been closed by security forces, as has a related center that was promoting women's electoral participation.</p>
        <p>In addition, the playwright who wrote the script for the film on voter participation, Ali Salem, has been charged with threatening national security because of his connection with Dr. Ibrahim. The film, which has never been released, was financed with a grant from the European Union and urges Egyptians to shed their apathy and vote.</p>
        <p>The latest accusation concerns a conference that Egyptian diplomats and officials and American officials also attended.</p>
        <p>In addition, the participants were a government minister, Ali el-Din Hilal; researchers in a research organization financed by the Egyptian government; the former Egyptian Ambassador to Canada, Tahseen Bashir; and representatives of the United States Defense Department. Egypt and the United States cooperate in a number of military and security projects and have operated joint training exercises for years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deeb, the lawyer, said Dr. Ibrahim had spoken at the conference about his research into Islamic extremism in Egypt.</p>
