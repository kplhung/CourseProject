        <p>It is not often that Tchaikovsky's ''Pathetique'' Symphony is chosen to open a program, as it was for the Boston Symphony's concert here at Tanglewood Friday night. The symphony's ominously quiet opening works better if an audience is already settled, and the desolate conclusion, in an effective performance, leaves little more to be said or even hoped for.</p>
        <p>Then again, it is not often that the soloist of the evening is of the caliber and reputation of Van Cliburn. Mr. Cliburn seldom performs these days, and when he does, it is almost always in Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto, more or less replicating the performance that established his career overnight at the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1968.</p>

        <p>It is not often that Tchaikovsky's ''Pathetique'' Symphony is chosen to open a program, as it was for the Boston Symphony's concert here at Tanglewood Friday night. The symphony's ominously quiet opening works better if an audience is already settled, and the desolate conclusion, in an effective performance, leaves little more to be said or even hoped for.</p>
        <p>Then again, it is not often that the soloist of the evening is of the caliber and reputation of Van Cliburn. Mr. Cliburn seldom performs these days, and when he does, it is almost always in Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto, more or less replicating the performance that established his career overnight at the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1968.</p>
        <p>And so it was here, with Mr. Cliburn inevitably bringing down the house to end the night with desolation far behind, leaving a sizable crowd of 11,500 with warm memories. With warmer memories, in this listener's case, than when Mr. Cliburn was last heard, nine years ago in the same work with the New York Philharmonic as part of Carnegie Hall's centenary celebration.</p>
        <p>On that occasion, Mr. Cliburn's first New York appearance in many years, he appeared nervous and ill at ease. Here he seemed more in his element despite a few momentary derailments in the finale.</p>
        <p>Once again, the interpretation was big, broad and raw-boned, occasionally suggesting, in its awesome power, some of what the young Cliburn must have sounded like. He positively thundered in the climactic octave runs near the end. But the voluptuary sound one might have expected was often undercut by a heavy, percussive touch, and Mr. Cliburn's vaunted lyricism was hampered by a sense of stop and go rather than ebb and flow.</p>
        <p>True, some of that discontinuity, especially in the first movement, seemed a function of searching, and it was moving to see Mr. Cliburn still trying to plumb depths of meaning in this piece after so many repetitions. Yet it is hard to know what he expects to find.</p>
        <p>This is, by and large, a young performer's music, preferring ready sentiment and sheer visceral excitement to profundity of thought. The excitement Mr. Cliburn conjured in his youth may be better reflected nowadays in a performance like the one Evgeny Kissin gave, also with the Boston Symphony under Seiji Ozawa, to open the Carnegie Hall season in 1995 (with the ''Pathetique'' also on the program).</p>
        <p>That interpretation -- fleet, fluid, playful and mercurial -- could hardly have been more different from the one here. But Mr. Kissin's clear-eyed youthful impetus and the gleeful virtuosity swept all before it, leaving a tired war horse sounding like a fresh, clean masterpiece.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ozawa followed Mr. Cliburn's comings and goings with a masterly hand, insuring a coherence the proceedings might easily have lacked. And Mr. Ozawa's work in the symphony was hardly less impressive.</p>
        <p>The ''Pathetique'' is another overworked standard needing constant revivification, and there was no particular reason to expect it from Mr. Ozawa and the Boston Symphony, whose work together in recent years has often exuded a sense of weary routine. But here was a polished performance (almost overpolished at the start) that looked for depth in all the right places.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ozawa imparted an epic breadth to the first movement, and the orchestra managed to sustain the line over long spans. The quiet moments so crucial to this work were just what they needed to be: dark and oppressive yet intense and charged with mystery. William R. Hudgins was superb in the clarinet solos, whether singing in eloquent full voice or murmuring in velvety pianissimos.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Ozawa announced last year that he intended to leave the orchestra in 2002, few doubted that the time was ripe for change. Yet on evidence like this, his tenure still holds the promise of bearing rich final fruits.</p>
        <p>For a music director, lame-duck status may carry more than diminishing power, as the orchestra, coming to realize that choice specialties of the collaboration are being revisited for perhaps the last time, plays with renewed ardor. There may be excitement in Boston even before 2002.</p>
        <p>MUSIC REVIEW  Correction:  August 14, 2000, Monday  A music review last Monday about Van Cliburn's piano performance at Tanglewood with the Boston Symphony Orchestra misstated the year in which he won the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow. It was 1958, not 1968.</p>
