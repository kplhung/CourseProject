        <p>LAST December, when the government was in the throes of Year 2000 anxiety, e-commerce initiatives barely crossed the minds of many federal officials. Not that e-commerce executives particularly cared: with their companies' stock prices climbing and much larger markets in their sights, they could afford to look past the government as a place to do business.</p>
        <p>Now that the only Year 2000 disaster has turned out to be the stock prices of dot-com businesses, Internet executives and federal officials are taking a much closer look at one another. Thanks in part to the Year 2000 scare, the government is much smarter about information technology systems and processes, and it is now directing that knowledge to Internet purchasing efforts.</p>
        <p>Internet companies, meanwhile, are looking for any market that can deliver revenue and keep their businesses afloat as the dot-com consolidation continues. The goal is not only to sell goods to the government to help build its e-commerce systems, but to provide goods that government purchasing agents can buy through those same systems.</p>
        <p>The Internet buzzcronym for this market is B2G, for business to government, and the numbers involved are large enough to get just about any dot-com's attention. The federal government will spend hundreds of millions of dollars building its e-commerce systems over the next five years, according to the Gartner Group, a technology research firm. And as those systems improve, the analysts say, the government should be able to move a large part of its $260 billion in annual purchases onto the Web.</p>
        <p>Thus, the race to B2G. But as dot-coms have begun to chase those dollars, they are finding that doing business with the government frequently requires two things Internet companies lack: time and patience.</p>
        <p>''Sure, there's tremendous potential there,'' said Christopher Baum, a Gartner Group analyst. ''But when you peer over the edge, you start to see a lot of rocks down there. It's like cliff-diving in Acapulco with the tide going out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baum said Washington was still far from having its computer systems set up so that private businesses could easily integrate their own Internet-based purchasing systems with those of the government. Such systems, for instance, might enable a vendor to display its catalog of office furniture on agency purchasing sites with little need to fine-tune it for each site.</p>
        <p>''Not even the largest businesses can afford to set up separate interfaces with even the biggest government agencies,'' Mr. Baum said.</p>
        <p>Ideally, he said, the government would also streamline the payment clearing process so that vendors on various agency Web sites could clear payments electronically through one source, instead of several.</p>
        <p>But there are several obstacles that could slow such initiatives, analysts and government leaders said. According to a report to be released today by the META Group, a technology research and consulting firm, federal employees involved in the government's e-commerce efforts said the biggest short-term obstacle was lack of money.</p>
        <p>According to the META Group, government agencies could halve the average cost of processing an order  -- to $10 from the current $20 -- by using the Internet. But even in a time of budget surpluses, officials said they had a difficult time persuading members of Congress to invest in e-commerce programs.</p>
        <p>''This kind of money is hard to get,'' an official said. ''If I say, 'Give me $10 million and I can save $50 million,' the benefit of that $50 million saved doesn't necessarily accrue to the glory of the people who make the decisions.''</p>
        <p>That thinking could change if either political party were to seize on the issue as campaign fodder. But changing the business culture within the government so that e-commerce can be adopted may be more difficult, longtime agency officials said.</p>
        <p>''We try to operate in Internet time, not Washington time,'' said David J. Barram, administrator of the General Services Administration, which oversees the procurement of about $40 billion in annual goods and services for federal agencies. ''But it's very hard because people don't want to make a mistake.''</p>
        <p>''The thought is, 'Somebody's going to get you,' '' Mr. Barram continued. ''It might be Congress. It might be a partisan attack from another party. But the ethic is to not take risks.''</p>
        <p>Analysts said Mr. Barram's agency was the federal government's biggest e-commerce success. In 1996, it started an online ordering site, GSAAdvantage.gov, which now lists more than a million items and last year sold more than $100 million in goods to government buyers.</p>
        <p>Because more than 90 percent of the financing for the General Services Administration comes from its own operations -- it collects transaction fees from vendors who sell to the government -- Mr. Barram said his agency's workers were somewhat less worried about having their financing withdrawn if they made mistakes. That ethic, plus the fact that the agency holds the purse strings to many online federal purchases, has made it a primary target for dot-coms wanting to get a piece of the business-to-government pie.</p>
        <p>One Internet company, MobShop, recently began working with the agency's Federal Supply Service to offer so-called group purchasing on the Buyers.gov site, which will roll out this month. In group purchasing, suppliers offer an item for sale at a progressively lower price as greater numbers of prospective buyers express interest.</p>
        <p>Jim Rose, MobShop's chief executive, said that even within the General Services Administration, it could be difficult bridging what he called the huge gulf between the culture of an Internet company and the government.</p>
        <p>''It's a huge opportunity for us,'' he said, ''because the government has the heft to do a lot of things. But there are all sorts of processes that don't make a lot of sense that you have to work within.''</p>
        <p>Those processes are even harder for an Internet company to accept, he said, because in the current market, dot-coms do not have unlimited resources to spend on projects that might not generate revenue quickly. ''There is a point where everybody will sit down and ask, 'Is this worth doing?' '' Mr. Rose said. ''I don't know where that point is. It's a constant game of assessing how best to use our resources.''</p>
        <p>But for those companies that can wait long enough, the benefits can be substantial. The Dell Computer Corporation, which began selling to the government online in 1996, will sell roughly $400 million worth of computers to federal workers on the Internet this year. Aside from the obvious revenue increase, Dell also saves time and money by moving these purchases online, according to Tom Buchsbaum, vice president for federal systems at Dell.</p>
        <p>''It cuts the order-cycle time for us,'' Mr. Buchsbaum said, ''and we don't have to cut a purchase order and have it processed. But it also makes all of government available to us at the click of a mouse, instead of having to get in a plane to D.C. to get things together. It certainly broadens our reach.''</p>
