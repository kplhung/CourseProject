        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Teacher Trainees Who Left Other Careers Speak of a Higher Calling'' (news article, Aug. 1):</p>
        <p>While the ideals expressed by New York City's new teaching fellows mirror the views of new teachers in our recent national study, the trainees may also experience some of the deep frustrations that our survey found.</p>
        <p>Although the new teachers we studied were also very eager and enthusiastic, most said they were unprepared for the realities of the classroom. Sixty percent, for example, believe they enter without enough experience in managing a classroom. They also worry about maintaining discipline and reaching problem students.</p>
        <p>Preparing new teachers to deal with challenges effectively will require far more than enthusiasm and altruism.</p>
        <p>DEBORAH WADSWORTH  New York, Aug. 1, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is president of Public Agenda, a public-opinion research group.</p>
