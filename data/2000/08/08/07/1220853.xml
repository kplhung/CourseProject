        <p>The well-accepted acceptance speech of George W. Bush is worthy of an exegete's eye.</p>
        <p>Most moving and evocative passage: In his visit to a jail for juveniles in Marlin, Tex., when a 15-year-old inmate asked him, ''What do you think of me?'', Bush perceptively interpreted the question to mean, ''Do you, a white man in a suit, really care what happens to me?''

        <p>The well-accepted acceptance speech of George W. Bush is worthy of an exegete's eye.</p>
        <p>Most moving and evocative passage: In his visit to a jail for juveniles in Marlin, Tex., when a 15-year-old inmate asked him, ''What do you think of me?'', Bush perceptively interpreted the question to mean, ''Do you, a white man in a suit, really care what happens to me?'' He drew on John Donne's no-man-is-an-island philosophy to decry the imprisoning wall of indifference separating rich and poor, ambitious and despairing. Bush had alluded earlier to the Berlin Wall that had come down ''with the leadership of Presidents Reagan and Bush.'' He then connected the metaphor of the jailed juvenile to Ronald Reagan's words in cold-war Berlin: we must ''tear down that wall.''</p>
        <p>Most subtle play on discomfort of many Democrats with the current president: He quoted Robert Frost, the poet older Americans remember speaking in the cold at John F. Kennedy's inauguration, of the dream of the nation's founders ''to occupy the land with character.'' That reminder set up Bush's observation that ''a president himself must be responsible,'' significantly followed by his pledge to ''uphold the honor and dignity of the office,'' which most voters believe Clinton failed to do.</p>
        <p>Most adept plays on phrases of previous presidents: Although Al Gore now leads F.D.R.'s party, ''the only thing he has to offer is fear itself.'' Bush had already improved on Clinton's phrase ''the tyranny of low expectations'' with his own ''the soft bigotry of low expectations'' and drove it home again in his acceptance.</p>
        <p>Most useful verb to deride the opposition's misuse of only-superpower status and economic boom: ''Instead of seizing this moment, the Clinton-Gore administration has squandered it.'' This word, of unknown origin but more mouth-filling than ''waste,'' should become a staple of Bush rhetoric.</p>
        <p>Most unexpected use of a code phrase to take an unequivocal stand: ''I will lead our nation toward a culture that values . . . the life of the unborn.'' This definition of the fetus as alive, which is unequivocally anti-abortion, showed the depths of his pro-life belief and the nonpolitical reason for his refusal to modify the G.O.P.'s extreme anti-abortion platform plank. It also gave millions of Republican women clear reason to vote for his opponent, which I suppose shows his confidence in holding his lead.</p>
        <p>Most uneven credo: This series of sentences beginning with ''I believe,'' summing up the speaker's core beliefs, both soared and stumbled. ''I believe in a God who calls us, not to judge our neighbors, but to love them'' was especially welcomed by gays, and there was tasteful eloquence in ''I believe in grace, because I have seen it, in peace, because I have felt it, in forgiveness, because I have needed it.'' But to cap this with ''And I believe this will be a tough race, down to the wire'' was demeaning.</p>
        <p>On the debit side, more on substance than style:</p>
        <p>Running against Washington. The Yale graduate and child of privilege assumed, Jimmy Carter style, a hardscrabble pose to assert that his ''background may lack the polish of Washington.'' And then, following a focus-group distaste for controversy, he dissociated himself from all investigations into Clinton-Gore scandals, including illegal fund-raising: ''I have no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years.'' Republicans on the unpopular ramparts of the rule of law were coolly informed he preferred ''civility and respect.''</p>
        <p>Oversimplifying foreign and defense policy. ''When America uses force in the world, the cause must be just, the goal must be clear and the victory must be overwhelming.'' This is the old Weinberger-Powell doctrine, and had it been applied in the Balkans would have awarded Kosovo to Slobodan Milosevic. If Bush becomes president, that all-or-nothing policy sentence -- denying limited intervention -- will come back to haunt him.</p>
        <p>Feeble labeling. ''It is a time for new beginnings. . . . I believe America is ready for a new beginning.'' We are readier for new sloganeering; Bush's ''New Beginning'' will go over as thunderously as Clinton's ''New Covenant.''</p>
        <p>Gore has put out word that he is composing his own acceptance. Welcome to the world of speechwriting, Al; the nonpartisan blades of exegesis go snicker-snack.</p>
