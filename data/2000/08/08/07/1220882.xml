        <p>Re ''Columbia Sets Pace in Profiting Off Research'' (news article, Aug. 2): A university makes a multitude of vital decisions that significantly affect the academic enterprise and send important signals about what the institution values. When the commercial world and the profit motive become intertwined in the fabric of a university, as they apparently have at Columbia University, the profit motive is likely to begin to influence academic decision-making.</p>
        <p>For example, will a marginal professor's central role in a commercial venture influence a decision to grant him tenure? In such a case, not even the university administration will know for sure.</p>
        <p>Admittedly, Columbia is not the only university to cross the line, but a university of its distinction should be leading the pack in setting boundaries and preserving the values of academic integrity and independence that have been at the core of our country's great universities.</p>
        <p>DANIEL STEINER  Boston, Aug. 2, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer, president of the New England Conservatory, was general counsel of Harvard University, 1970-92.</p>
