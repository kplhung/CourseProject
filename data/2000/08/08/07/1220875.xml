        <p>MANHATTAN: ELECTRIC BILL LEGISLATION -- Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer plans to introduce legislation that would permit New York City to suspend local taxes on gasoline and electricity, staff members said. The plan comes less than a week after Consolidated Edison officials blamed recent increases in electricity bills on deregulation and the high cost of fuel. An assistant to Mr. Stringer said the money the city would lose by suspending the taxes might be made up through as much as $60 million in unexpected tax revenue from Consolidated Edison because of  higher bills and an increase in customers. Mr. Stringer, an Upper West Side Democrat, plans to detail his plan at a news conference today.</p>

        <p>BUFFALO: CONSTRUCTION SITE VIOLENCE -- Beatings, bombings and death threats at Niagara County construction sites have prompted a federal investigation. The attacks include the beating of a carpenter working on a high school; the beating of 6 tile setters at a grocery store  construction site by as many as 15 people; the bombing of the home of a worker who had a dispute with Laborers Local 91; and $100,000 in vandalism done at a Town of Niagara landfill site. All the incidents have been at sites where Laborers Local 91 has had disputes with contractors, nonunion workers and other unions.</p>

        <p>SYRACUSE: GUN BUYBACK PROGRAM -- A grocery store chain's offer to buy back guns has brought in 316 weapons in 12 days, for an average of about 26 a day. By comparison, a program in New York City brought in about 23 weapons a day. New York's program offered amnesty and $100, while the Syracuse program offered amnesty and $50 in groceries.</p>

        <p>ATLANTIC CITY: BANNER-TOWING PLANES -- The federal government may again consider requiring safety guards on banner-towing planes, said Robert Gretz, an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. The pilot might have survived a crash in Lakewood last month if a guard had been installed around the rudder, Mr. Gretz said. The pilot, Robert Lewis, died after his banner towrope became entangled in the steering mechanism. In 1998, the board asked the Federal Aviation Administration to require the guards, but the F.A.A. rejected that as unnecessary.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: FAKE LAWYER SENTENCED -- A man who admitted practicing as an immigration lawyer for more than a decade without a license was sentenced to a year in jail and must pay $50,000 in restitution. A Mercer County assistant prosecutor, Lawrence McGivney, said the lawyer, Robert Callan, 61, preyed on people who dreamed of coming to America. Mr. McGivney said many were deported because Mr. Callan, who had an office in Ewing, handled their cases improperly.</p>

        <p>HACKENSACK: E-ZPASS SPEEDERS -- Drivers who speed through electronic tollbooths faster than the posted speed limit of 5 miles per hour could lose E-ZPass privileges under a proposal being considered by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. At the George Washington Bridge, for example, average speeds range from 6 m.p.h. to 11 m.p.h., but some motorists are going as fast as 50 m.p.h., and the speeding may be one reason accidents there increased last year.</p>

        <p>NORTH STONINGTON: TRIBAL RECOGNITION -- The head of the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs plans to leave in January, before a final decision on recognition for the Eastern Pequot and Paucatuck Eastern Pequot tribes. Kevin Gover, the agency's head, told The Norwich Bulletin that a ruling on tribal recognition is probably more than a year away, and he said that he intended to leave at the end of the Clinton administration. The state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, and others have said that Mr. Gover has a conflict of interest because he once served as a lawyer for the Golden Hill Paugusetts, another Connecticut tribe that is seeking recognition. But Mr. Gover said ''anyone sitting in my chair'' would consider only the merits of the petition.</p>

Mr. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, has been traveling to court appearances from his home in Hobe Sound, Fla.</p>
