        <p>A magnetic resonance imaging test on Mike Piazza's left knee today revealed a mild sprain of his medial collateral ligament, which will probably keep him out of the Mets lineup for three to five days.</p>
        <p>The test confirmed what the Mets expected on Saturday, when Piazza left the game in the fourth inning after injuring the knee running to first. He had grounded a ball to third, where Arizona's Matt Williams fired to first to nip Piazza, who sprinted through the base and then dropped to a squat, turning to Umpire Bill Miller to protest the call.</p>

        <p>A magnetic resonance imaging test on Mike Piazza's left knee today revealed a mild sprain of his medial collateral ligament, which will probably keep him out of the Mets lineup for three to five days.</p>
        <p>The test confirmed what the Mets expected on Saturday, when Piazza left the game in the fourth inning after injuring the knee running to first. He had grounded a ball to third, where Arizona's Matt Williams fired to first to nip Piazza, who sprinted through the base and then dropped to a squat, turning to Umpire Bill Miller to protest the call.</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine said the reaction, which was out of character for Piazza, most likely led to the sprain.</p>
        <p>''They're pretty sure it's when he went by the bag and turned and went down on his knees,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Piazza said he thought he sprained the knee when he did not hit the bag flush with his foot, although his reaction, he said, ''didn't help it.'' Piazza iced the knee today and was unable to squat, but he said he was relieved the condition was not serious.</p>
        <p>Valentine said the Mets might need to bring in a reserve catcher to back up Todd Pratt. Valentine said Piazza might be able to pinch-hit as early as Monday, when the Mets begin a four-game series with the Astros.</p>
        <p>Hampton's Homecoming</p>
        <p>When Mike Hampton struggled early this season, Bobby Valentine noticed that he was battling other factors besides the teams he was facing. The cold weather, his mechanics -- at times, Valentine thought, caused Hampton to be ''a little distracted.''</p>
        <p>Valentine says he has no doubts Hampton will stay focused Monday night, but Hampton isn't so sure. The Mets left-hander will be making his first start in Houston since the Astros traded him last December, and he expects it to be an emotional game.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to have to be able to find a way to relax and not get too pumped up,'' Hampton said.</p>
        <p>Hampton spent six years with the Astros, who won the National League Central title in his final three seasons there. Hampton said he expected the Astros to add to their payroll as they moved from the Astrodome to Enron Field, but instead they dumped several players, including Hampton and Derek Bell to the Mets. Houston now has the worst record in baseball.</p>
        <p>''Things were going well, we had a good team with a chance to win,'' Hampton said. ''What more could you ask for? You always would like to stay in one place and finish your career there. Not many people do it anymore.''</p>
        <p>Hampton, who is only 27 years old and will most likely be the most sought pitcher on the free-agent market this winter, is not sure where he will play next year.</p>
        <p>He said he felt comfortable with the Mets, though he was still not well acquainted with New York. ''All I know is, I get on the Triborough and I keep on going,'' he said. Hampton and his family are living in an apartment in Manhattan because he said he would not buy a home until he signed a long-term deal somewhere.</p>
        <p>The Mets lost their best chance to re-sign Hampton before free agency when talks on an extension broke down in February. Hampton indicated then that he was not interested in negotiating during the season, and the sides have not done so.</p>
        <p>Zeile Gets a Rest</p>
        <p>Until he singled in his last at-bat on Saturday, Mets first baseman Todd Zeile was 0 for 20 at Bank One Ballpark. Zeile leads the Mets in games played, but he sat out today's game and was happy about that.</p>
        <p>''I needed this one today,'' he said. ''For some reason, this is my nemesis stadium. Let someone else get some knocks today.''</p>
        <p>Zeile has been among the most consistent Mets hitters this year, but his production has tailed off lately; he has had no hits in five of his last seven games and is 4 for 26 in that span. Zeile was ill on the Mets' last road trip, and is just now regaining his strength.</p>
        <p>''I'm in that post-All-Star-break lull,'' he said. ''I told Bobby, 'I'm timing it just right, so at the end of this month and September I'll be right where I need to be.' ''</p>
