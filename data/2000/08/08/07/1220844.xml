        <p>For decades, hundreds of thousands of frail older Americans have suffered unnecessary neglect, injury, abuse, malnutrition and even death while in the paid care of licensed nursing homes.

In 1990, Congress asked the executive branch to report by 1992 whether there should be a defined ratio of staff to patients in nursing homes, but it was not until 1997 that the study got priority, and not until 11 days ago -- in a labor market grown so tight that 41 states have reported that nursing homes cannot hire or retain the staff they need -- that the Health Care Financing Administration finally delivered draft copies to Congress.</p>

        <p>For decades, hundreds of thousands of frail older Americans have suffered unnecessary neglect, injury, abuse, malnutrition and even death while in the paid care of licensed nursing homes. Congress and the states have passed laws in response, and the federal government, which spends $39 billion a year on nursing home care, has subjected the industry to a complex web of regulations, annual inspections and an exhaustive reporting system designed to govern the quality of care.</p>
        <p>But Congress has never established how many nurses and nurses aides are needed to give adequate -- much less good -- care for the number of residents in a home, and it has never required substantial training or competitive wages for the aides. In 1990, Congress asked the executive branch to report by 1992 whether there should be a defined ratio of staff to patients in nursing homes, but it was not until 1997 that the study got priority, and not until 11 days ago -- in a labor market grown so tight that 41 states have reported that nursing homes cannot hire or retain the staff they need -- that the Health Care Financing Administration finally delivered draft copies to Congress.</p>
        <p>The study, of 1,800 nursing homes in New York, California and Ohio, determined that conditions like bedsores, malnutrition and weight loss increase when staffing falls below a certain level. Fifty-four percent of nursing homes do not meet minimally adequate staff levels, and 92 percent have less staff than necessary to give optimal care. The facilities with the highest staff levels and wages are the nonprofit homes. The ones with the lowest ratios and wages are the for-profit homes.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration, which has made a serious effort in the last several years to regulate nursing homes and crack down on abusers, has now given Congress a report that makes the case for a new definition of acceptable care for older Americans. Achieving competent levels of care could mean huge increases in staffing and staff expense for nursing homes, requiring greater government financing. Each nursing home has a different mix of residents, with different infirmities and different needs for care.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive overhaul of the system should wait a year for the study to complete its second phase: the construction of formulas to suggest what staff ratios are appropriate for different caseloads in different homes. But Congress should in this session restore some of the Medicare money that it cut from nursing homes three years ago, and it can endorse the concept of tying such money to staff ratios in nursing homes.</p>
