        <p>Blow to Iran's Reformers From Top Religious Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme religious leader, sided with the country's conservatives and ordered the Parliament to scrap a bill aimed at restoring a free press. The proposed law was the centerpiece of President Mohammad Khatami's package for the new Parliament, meant to counter a conservative crackdown in which courts have closed liberal newspapers and jailed editors and intellectuals.</p>

        <p>Milosevic's Enemies Are Split  Serbia's largest opposition party nominated its own candidate to oppose President Slobodan Milosevic in September elections, ignoring appeals from the rest of the opposition to rally behind a common standard-bearer.

        <p>Gore Aides Laud Daley For Reviving Campaign  Six weeks after taking charge of Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign, William M. Daley seems to have revived the once flagging morale of the Democratic campaign. Mr. Daley has limited infighting and imposed discipline on the campaign's strategy and message. Mr. Gore's aides say they feel more optimism than at any point since the vice president swept the primaries.</p>

        <p>Cheney Thrusts and Parries  Dick Cheney, Gov. George W. Bush's running mate, repeated his promise of a ''coast to coast'' battle to evict the Democrats from the White House, but he denied any specific attacks on President Clinton. He acknowledged that House Republicans bore some responsibility for the ''partisan bickering and backbiting'' he rails against in his speeches.</p>

        <p>Death Row's Mentally Retarded  Oliver Cruz, who was classified as mentally retarded by psychologists at his trial, is scheduled to be executed on Wednesday for the rape and murder of a woman in Texas. Of the 38 states with capital punishment, 13 prohibit execution of a mentally retarded convict. While many Americans support the death penalty, polls show that a majority make an exception for the mentally retarded. Experts estimate that about 10 percent of America's death row inmates are mentally retarded.</p>

        <p>Long Island Democrat Faces Republicans' Wrath  Republicans and Democrats are engaged in a fierce fight over control of the House, where the Republicans have a thin margin that could be wiped out by the loss of six seats. But no individual race quickens the pulse of House Republican leaders as does that of Representative Michael P. Forbes, the Long Island Democrat who defected from the Republican Party last year. The Republicans seek revenge. On their list of targets, Mr. Forbes places first.</p>

        <p>6 Die in Violent City Night  Detectives were seeking suspects after one of the most violent nights in New York City this year, a series of altercations or gunfights in which 20 people were shot and 4 others stabbed. Six of the victims died. The police made only one arrest in the homicide cases, and were unsure whether the suspect would be charged with murder. The violence spanned all five boroughs.</p>

        <p>Catskills Casino in Doubt  Four months after the federal Interior Department approved plans for an Indian casino in Monticello, N.Y., three separate developers with three different tribes are battling to bring gambling to the Catskills. But none of the three are the same team of developer and tribe approved by the Interior Department. Many proponents are worried that their best shot at bringing casinos, and the accompanying jobs and tourists, to the Catskills may be slipping away.</p>
