      <block class="full_text">
        <p>William L. Clay, who created a stir more than 30 years ago when he became Missouri's first black congressman, is creating another one by retiring, setting off a free-for-all for a seat that has not been open since 1968.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clay, the senior member of his state's Congressional delegation, is working feverishly to help his son, State Senator William L. Clay Jr., succeed him in Missouri's First Congressional District.</p>
        <p>But the younger Mr. Clay, who is known by his middle name, Lacy, is confronting a crowded field of competitors in this heavily Democratic district, which includes the largely black north side of St. Louis and a large swath of St. Louis County, a predominantly white suburban area.</p>
        <p>While there are five candidates in Tuesday's Democratic primary, the two considered the most serious -- and the two spending the most money -- are Mr. Clay and Charlie Dooley, a member of the St. Louis County Council. Of the five, only Mr. Clay and Mr. Dooley hold elective office.</p>
        <p>The race is being eagerly watched because it could affect how Missouri's Congressional districts are redrawn next year, particularly the First District and the adjacent district, represented by Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader.</p>
        <p>But it is also being watched because it is a contest where race provides a subtle but profound undercurrent, even though both major contenders are black. Black residents make up slightly more than half of the district, but about 60 percent of registered voters are white.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dooley has maintained that the Clay campaign is trying to energize the black electorate against him by asserting that Mr. Dooley's role as a county official makes him less concerned about black residents in the city of St. Louis. At the same time, the Dooley campaign has made nepotism an issue, asserting that while the father has been a suitable congressman, the seat is not the birthright of the son.</p>
        <p>''There's no question about it,'' Mr. Dooley said, ''there is a racial dynamic here. Because I'm from the county and most of my political allies are from the county and white, it's been portrayed by the other camp that I'm not black enough. That's stupid talk.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clay vehemently denies the accusation. ''I have never engaged in racially divisive politics, and I never will,'' he said in a restaurant in the trendy Central West End section of the city. ''That's not my style.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Clay, who has been in the state Legislature for 17 years, bristles at the suggestion of nepotism. ''No one is trying to inherit anything,'' he said. ''I am going in front of the voters like I have eight previous times. I am asking for their vote based on my record and my accomplishments. I find that suggestion insulting.''</p>
        <p>While the Clay name is widely known in St. Louis and the congressman has worked hard to pass his support and campaign organization to his son, the younger Mr. Clay's election is by no means assured.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clay's base is in the city of St. Louis, from the trim brick homes along Fairground Park to the dilapidated storefronts along the north side and the stylish restaurants and stores in the Central West End. While the city once made up all of the First Congressional District, the area has been bruised by an exodus of people and jobs, and the decline in population has pushed the district's boundaries far into the suburbs.</p>
        <p>That means Mr. Clay must work to get votes from an area where Mr. Dooley has greater influence.</p>
        <p>But there have been other problems for Mr. Clay in a race that has grown increasingly acrimonious. For one thing, though his father has long been known as a champion of organized labor, Mr. Clay has not won the support of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. For the first time in recent memory, the union declined to make an endorsement in the race, saying instead that its affiliate labor organizations should make their own decisions.</p>
        <p>Second, the Dooley camp has accused Mr. Clay of a series of ethical lapses. Most prominently, it has attacked Mr. Clay because he once worked for a medical supply company operated by two brothers who have been charged with Medicare and Medicaid fraud in Atlanta. And Mr. Dooley's aides have said Mr. Clay failed to include his relationship with the company on financial disclosure forms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clay acknowledged that he had worked for the company as a sales representative, but left two years ago. He added that there had been no hint that the business had done anything improper in Missouri.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Clay has sued Mr. Dooley, saying his campaign formed a committee to illegally evade the limitations on campaign contributions.</p>
        <p>While character has emerged as a central theme, the two major candidates agree on virtually every significant issue. Both want to use more federal money to hire teachers, and both agree that health care should be more widely available. They oppose the death penalty and support abortion rights.</p>
        <p>But their styles are hardly similar. The 52-year-old Mr. Dooley, a thin, well-dressed man who recently retired after 30 years with the Boeing Corporation as a manager in the microfilm department, often appears serious and earnest. Lacy Clay, 44, in contrast, is a gregarious legislator who seems as comfortable slapping the backs of his fellow senators as dancing with schoolchildren at an outdoor festival in his district.</p>
        <p>The contest could well have long-term implications for Missouri's Congressional districts. Since the cardinal rule of redistricting is to protect incumbents, a victory by Mr. Clay would likely put pressure on the Legislature to preserve the district's St. Louis neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Dooley wins, legislators would likely shift the district's boundaries farther into the suburbs of St. Louis County. That would enable legislators to extend Mr. Gephardt's district north, into the heavily black -- and securely Democratic -- terrain of St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Many politicians suggest that Mr. Dooley will benefit from a strong showing in the county and from the support of many of its elected officials and some labor groups.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Clay can expect strong support from other union locals as well as the endorsement of most elected officials in St. Louis. And while Mr. Clay insists that the Congressional seat is not an inheritance, he shows no reluctance to invoke his father's name.</p>
        <p>''My father has been very involved in this race,'' Mr. Clay said. ''And I admire and revere my father. In politics, they say, you inherit your father's friends and enemies. Fortunately, he has more friends than enemies.''</p>
