        <p>Thousands of workers fanned out to picket sites throughout the East yesterday as negotiators for Verizon Communications and its unions pressed forward with efforts to end a strike by about 86,000 telephone employees.</p>
        <p>While hardly affecting routine services, the labor dispute at Verizon, the nation's largest local and wireless telephone company, disrupted operator-assisted services, repairs and installations for 25 million residential and business customers from Maine to Virginia. More broadly, the strike, over issues including the outsourcing of work and the unionization of employees in the wireless business, may help define the role of organized labor in some of the most rapidly growing high-technology industries.</p>
        <p>''This could open the door for unions to move not only into wireless but into other high-tech parts of the economy as well,'' said Paul Osterman, professor of management at M.I.T.</p>
        <p>Verizon was able to limit the immediate impact of the strike by deploying about 30,000 managers to cover tasks normally performed by the striking employees, who walked off the job at 12:01 a.m. yesterday. Automated services on Verizon's network and wireless services were not disrupted. But delays in repairs and operator-assisted services could become more common as the workweek begins.</p>
        <p>While members of the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers picketed at several hundred Verizon facilities in several Eastern cities, there was progress in the talks in Washington.</p>
        <p>Late Saturday night, Verizon offered concessions that would allow the unions to organize more easily in the company's fast-growing wireless division, a central bargaining issue that could have a substantial effect on labor relations in the entire wireless communications industry, said people close to the talks.</p>
        <p>Verizon (pronounced va-RISE-en) was formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of GTE and its venture in wireless communications with Vodafone AirTouch. Though it operates the nation's largest wireless carrier, only a few dozen of the wireless company's 32,000 workers are union members, compared with 80 percent of the 120,000 employees in Verizon's local telephone division.</p>
        <p>But even as the company and the unions approached compromise on the wireless issue, on job security and on Verizon's practice of outsourcing work in fast-growing areas like the installation of high-speed Internet lines, they appeared to be far apart on other issues last evening.</p>
        <p>According to a spokeswoman from the Communications Workers of America, the unions and the company remained most divided over forced overtime and job stress.</p>
        <p>Neither side appeared optimistic that an agreement could be reached late yesterday, although the unions and Verizon said they were ready to continue negotiations into the morning if necessary.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, striking workers in 13 Eastern states and Washington, dug in for a walkout.</p>
        <p>''My wife and I figured it out: three days,'' said Roger Doucette, 53, when asked how long he could afford to be on strike from his job as a trainer at a Verizon service center in Braintree, Mass.</p>
        <p>But he said he was ready to strike as long as necessary, given his particular concern over the company's policy of outsourcing work in the installation of high-speed Internet lines.</p>
        <p>In New York City, only a scattering of union members could be found at Verizon facilities, perhaps because of the progress in the talks. At the company's headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, six protesters, clad in red for union solidarity, stood behind police barricades.</p>
        <p>''We're not trying to sabotage. We just want more money,'' said Shirley Harris, 33, an administrative assistant. ''It's very expensive to live in New York.''</p>
        <p>In other cities, the strike generated greater tension between workers and management.</p>
        <p>In Pennsylvania, striking employees blockaded entrances to Verizon's main switching facility in Philadelphia, effectively keeping managers from entering the building. In Delaware, some strikers also blocked access to facilities. The company was seeking court injunctions to deal with these cases, said Eric Rabe, Verizon's spokesman.</p>
        <p>Only about 740 union workers out of 3,100 scheduled to work in the strike region yesterday showed up. Most of those were in New Jersey and not covered under the same contract as the striking workers, according to Verizon.</p>
        <p>Managers were expected to work 12-hour shifts to provide stopgap service while the strike continued.</p>
        <p>''After a while I'll probably get tired of this,'' said Stephenne L. Bell, who normally does budget tracking analysis in Verizon's marketing and communications department. On Sunday, she was working a 5:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. shift at a customer service center in Washington.</p>
        <p>In the Bronx, where about 2,500 telephone lines were put out of service yesterday because of a cut line, Verizon said repairs could be delayed because of the walkout.</p>
        <p>In New York City, Verizon deals with an average of 2,600 requests for telephone installations and 4,500 requests for repairs each day, said Steven Marcus, a spokesman for the company.</p>
        <p>As the company moved to handle potential service problems and talks continued, the negotiations were of particular interest to employees in Verizon's largely nonunionized wireless division.</p>
        <p>''I'm tired of being treated like a second-class citizen within the company,'' said a customer service representative from a call center in Woburn, Mass. She declined to provide her name, she said, because Verizon had told employees at the call center that they would be fired if they discussed joining the union on work premises.</p>
        <p>''With a union contract, I'd have chances for better pay,'' she said.</p>
        <p>According to the union, customer service representatives at Verizon's wireless unit who are not union members in Massachusetts make about a third less than unionized employees who do virtually the same job in other parts of the company. The company says pay differences are much smaller than what the union contends.</p>
        <p>The union is seeking assurances from Verizon that the company will not interfere with or actively discourage organizing activities at the wireless division, making it easier for the union to sign up employees. Because Verizon Wireless controls nearly 30 percent of the wireless market, the outcome of the strike could affect labor relations throughout the wireless industry.</p>
        <p>''If labor can't penetrate the new economy, they will be assigned to its margins,'' said Stanley Aronowitz, a sociology professor at the City University of New York. Mr. Aronowitz compared the situation to union efforts in the 1930's to organize in the automotive and steel industries.</p>
        <p>''They are going after the biggie with the idea that the others will fall in line,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nearly all of the striking workers are from former Bell Atlantic divisions. Employees at old GTE units are not involved in the walkout, although the communication workers' union said the strike might prompt walkouts by 1,200 workers at former GTE operations in Kentucky and North Carolina, where separate contracts have expired.</p>
