        <p>Joe Torre met with David Cone yesterday and reiterated that he would stay in the starting rotation. But the manager also conceded the possibility that Cone would skip his next scheduled start.</p>
        <p>Because Cone threw 137 pitches in six draining innings against Seattle on Saturday, Torre was leery about bringing him back on only four days' rest to start on Thursday afternoon against Oakland.

        <p>Joe Torre met with David Cone yesterday and reiterated that he would stay in the starting rotation. But the manager also conceded the possibility that Cone would skip his next scheduled start.</p>
        <p>Because Cone threw 137 pitches in six draining innings against Seattle on Saturday, Torre was leery about bringing him back on only four days' rest to start on Thursday afternoon against Oakland. Torre seems likely to bypass Cone on that day and simply give him additional rest before he tries to end a streak of 15 straight starts without a victory.</p>
        <p>''We could possibly skip David and slot him the next time,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Torre could give Cone one extra day of rest and start him on Friday, but that would require using Orlando Hernandez on three days' rest or starting Dwight Gooden on Thursday. The Yankees do not want to tamper with El Duque because he came off the disabled list yesterday and was ineffective. Gooden, who was moved to the bullpen last Friday, is Torre's obvious option to start on Thursday.</p>
        <p>After Cone throws at Yankee Stadium today, Torre will meet with the pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre, and determine when Cone should start. Torre allowed Cone to toss the most pitches he had thrown since Game 5 of the 1995 division series because he desperately wanted Cone to get a victory. But that outing might hurt the 37-year-old's chances of returning to the mound on time.</p>
        <p>''Let's see how you feel tomorrow,  and we'll make a decision,'' Torre said he told Cone. ''The only thing I assured him is I still want him to start.''</p>
        <p>Torre must favor the betterment of the team over the betterment of Cone, which is why he may bypass Cone. Cone, who thanked Torre for permitting him to pitch the sixth inning in an emotional atmosphere on Saturday, admitted that he had to regain Torre's faith.</p>
        <p>''He deserves that loyalty from me,'' Torre said. ''Again, I wouldn't do it if I didn't think he could win. I'd have to make a difficult decision. I still think he can win. I'm not going to be loyal to a fault. I don't think I am.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch Not Getting Better</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch did not play for the fourth straight game, and it seemed likely that the Yankees would place the second baseman on the 15-day disabled list. The Yankees have described Knoblauch's injury as a strained right elbow, but Knoblauch said yesterday that he had a ''small tear on a small muscle'' and that Dr. Stuart Hershon told him it was difficult to predict how long it would take to heal.</p>
        <p>''I just know that it hasn't gotten better with all the treatment,'' Knoblauch said. ''It's been 10 or 11 days of treatment.''</p>
        <p>When Knoblauch was asked if he might have to go on the disabled list for the first time in his 10-year career, he said: ''I guess so. Yeah.''</p>
        <p>After Knoblauch tested the elbow by throwing strenuously on Friday and still felt sore, Joe Torre kept him out of the starting lineup. Torre figured that Knoblauch would be able to play second by today, but Knoblauch explained that he was very sore on Saturday and that ''it was hurting on every throw.'' He has not played second since July 24.</p>
        <p>''I am concerned only because it was getting better,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch sarcastically referred to himself as the bionic man because in this injury-plagued season he has been anything but indestructible. Knoblauch has played in only 78 of 106 games because of injuries to his elbow, his wrist and his forearm, and the Yankees are fortunate to have Jose Vizcaino to play second.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is, it's hurting,'' Knoblauch said. ''If I could play, I would. If I could throw, I would. I wouldn't be sitting here just watching the games.''</p>
        <p>Strawberry Set for Surgery</p>
        <p>Darryl Strawberry is scheduled to undergo surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from his stomach today at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. Strawberry, who is serving a one-year suspension from Major League Baseball, had colon cancer surgery on Oct. 3, 1998. Strawberry learned a week and a half ago that the cancer had returned.</p>
