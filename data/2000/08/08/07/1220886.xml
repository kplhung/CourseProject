        <p>More than 50 years after their high school graduation, a group of men huddled around a television set showing old Technicolor footage of the streets where they grew up.</p>
        <p>''The jubes!'' cried Joseph Elder, as the camera lingered on an open ditch carrying water through the city.</p>
        <p>''Oh, wow, kharbozeh!'' said Raymond Fort, spotting oblong Persian melons stacked against a brick wall. ''Can't get them better anywhere else.''</p>
        <p>''Those are the Alborz Mountains in the background,'' another man said. ''They were 13,000 feet high.''</p>
        <p>The reunion was in New York over the weekend, but the city in the film was Tehran. In an often emotional three-day reunion at the  Roosevelt Hotel, more than 500 alumni and teachers remembered two American-run international schools as idyllic cultural crossroads where children from any race, religion or ethnicity felt at home.</p>
        <p>The Community School of Tehran, started by American Presbyterian missionaries in 1935, weathered a world war, a coup and a revolution before it and its counterpart, Iranzamin, closed in 1980, a year after Iran's Islamic revolution. Alumni from North America, Europe, Australia and the Middle East who attended the schools between 1935 and 1980 extolled the academic standards, saying that when they moved elsewhere, they were often years ahead of their peers. But the highest praise was reserved for the schools' multinationalism, with the children of ambassadors, businessmen, teachers and exiles representing more than 50 countries.</p>
        <p>Like similar international schools around the world, the Community School reflected global political tides. As war and then communism spread across Europe and the Far East, and anti-Semitism surfaced in nearby Arab countries, refugees spilled into Iran. With its Western-looking shah and growing  international community, it was considered a haven, and the English-language school was a magnet for new arrivals.</p>
        <p>''There were professors from the Sorbonne teaching us French and Latin,'' refugees from World War II, said Kamel Bahary, a 1949 graduate. He also recalled swimming at the home of H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who attended the school while his father was helping to train the Iranian police force. ''There were people from Norway, Sweden, Romania, Iraq,'' he said. ''We had Chinese, Japanese.''</p>
        <p>In 1953, Community's headmaster, a missionary named Richard Irvine, limited the number of Americans to preserve the cultural balance. A separate American school opened and other international schools followed. Iranzamin, which means ''the ground of Iran,'' was founded by Mr. Irvine in 1967 to prepare students for a university education in any country, not just the United States and Britain, as Community School did.</p>
        <p>The Iranian government had once discouraged Iranians from attending foreign schools, but by the 1960's many families of the upper middle class were enrolling their sons and daughters in hopes that a Western education would afford greater opportunities.</p>
        <p>Each era had its own political and social flavor. In the 1940's, American soldiers taught students to square-dance. In the 1950's, as Americans and Soviets competed for influence and the shah of Iran was overthrown and then reinstated, students peered over garden gates at the street fighting. Yearbooks from the 1970's show long-haired teenagers in flare-legged jeans skiing, playing guitar, and wandering through the ruins of Persepolis, the ancient Persian capital. But by the end of that decade, those students were crouching in their school buses to avoid stray bullets as revolutionaries burned down banks and cinemas.</p>
        <p>By then, the bicultural experience had grown complicated.</p>
        <p>Ronnie Rabbie, a 1975 Community School graduate, described himself and his fellow Iranian classmates as a ''lost generation of imperialism,'' who liked pizza and were more fluent in English than in Farsi. But after the revolution that deposed the shah in 1979, Mr. Rabbie said, he was kicked out of the Iranian Army for being ''foreign educated,'' and Iranian children he had known all his life turned against him. ''They told me: 'It's time to go, Ronnie, it's time to go. It's not your country any more,' '' he recalled.</p>
        <p>In 1980, amid mounting restrictions on curriculum and student activities, the two schools closed.  Revolutionaries made a bonfire out of Iranzamin's library, but negotiated a bizarre compromise over Community's. ''They said, 'O.K., we get half the books,' '' recalled Bardia Askari, a student at the time. ''So they took the A through M encyclopedias and we got the N through Z.''</p>
        <p>As foreigners and many middle-class Iranians left the country, the Iranian students who stayed on were eventually sent to Farsi-language schools. ''We were all good students,'' said Niloo Momtazi. ''But we felt like total idiots trying to decipher the textbooks.'' Today, Iran has a few foreign schools, but Iranians must attend Iranian schools.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, after dining on pomegranate and walnut stew, kebab and rose-water ice cream, alumni danced to pre-revolutionary Iranian and American favorites and pored over old yearbooks.</p>
        <p>Paul Kooros, a Community alumnus who is half Iranian and half American, was in ninth grade when his family left for the United States in 1979. ''Everyone was expecting to come back and pick up where they left off,'' he said. ''So none of us traded addresses, not that we had any to trade.''</p>
        <p>But on this night, as Mr. Kooros exchanged stories with excited long-lost classmates, he was beaming. ''It's a cathartic experience,'' he said, ''to come back and complete these childhoods.''</p>
