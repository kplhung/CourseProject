        <p>Representative Michael P. Forbes didn't want to talk about it initially: the television advertisement that his Republican foes spliced together to try to humiliate him. Why dignify it?</p>
        <p>Then he reconsidered.</p>
        <p>''It's silly, and it's part of the hate-vengeance campaign, and a very childish approach they are taking,'' said Mr. Forbes, the Democrat who defected from the Republican Party in disgust just last year, and in so doing became the most despised Democrat -- on a very long list -- among many Republicans.</p>
        <p>Republicans and Democrats are engaged in one of their fiercest fights ever this year over control of the House, where the Republicans have a precarious majority that would be wiped out by the loss of six seats.  But no individual race quickens the pulse of House Republican leaders as does Mr. Forbes's. In fact, his Long Island seat appears almost irrelevant to them; it is revenge they seek, payback for the embarrassment he caused them and the trouble he sowed. On their list of targets, Mr. Forbes, who has served three terms in the House,  places first.</p>
        <p>Hence, the television advertisement they are considering running. The ad, which pokes goofy fun at Mr. Forbes throughout, ends with the congressman's clowning around and pretending to make rude sounds by squeezing his hand under his armpit in the fashion of adolescent boys. The tape was an outtake, clipped from a moment of horseplay after he taped an ad as a Republican, and someone with a long memory unearthed it for the House Republicans' campaign committee. So far, House Republicans haven't broadcast it, although they did treat themselves to a private screening.</p>
        <p>As hard as Mr. Forbes and his opponent, Felix J. Grucci Jr., the fireworks manufacturer, who is the town supervisor here, try to make their campaign about local issues and local politics, Washington power brokers cannot resist joining in the rumble and trash-talking.</p>
        <p>Ask him what he thinks of Mr. Forbes, and Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, chairman of the House Republican Campaign Committee, eagerly tosses out, yet again, his standard quip: ''Have you ever heard of the movie 'Dead Man Walking'?''</p>
        <p>''We're going to hit him pretty hard,'' Mr. Davis said. ''Forbes is the most vulnerable Democrat in the House. Period.''</p>
        <p>House and Senate Republican leaders have pumped $45,000 so far into Mr. Grucci's campaign coffers from their personal political action committee funds and have sent Senator John McCain to stump for Mr. Grucci.</p>
        <p>Democrats are doing their part to help shore up Mr. Forbes's campaign. President Clinton held a fund-raiser in Manhattan that raised $500,000 for Mr. Forbes, even though Mr. Forbes voted to oust him on all four articles of impeachment. Several cabinet secretaries plan to visit Mr. Forbes's district, in eastern Suffolk County. One of them, Bruce Babbitt, the Interior secretary, has already made an appearance there.</p>
        <p>One conservative political organization, the Republican Majority Issues Committee, which is headed by a former staff member  to Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, turned on one of its own icons for political benefit and ran an advertising campaign tying Mr. Forbes to Representative Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a favorite Democratic target.</p>
        <p>And the New York Democratic Party made its own ad, tying Mr. Grucci to ''special interest'' allies, which it said were ''big polluters, big tobacco companies and big-deal wheeler-dealer Texas politicians.''</p>
        <p>The race also pits two archfoes -- big business, which is generally supporting Mr. Grucci, and labor unions, which are helping Mr. Forbes with grass-roots campaigning -- against each other.</p>
        <p>To date, according to the candidates, Mr. Forbes has raised $1.2 million, and has $850,000 in the bank; Mr. Grucci has raised $800,000, and has $500,000 on hand.</p>
        <p>Political analysts do not single out Mr. Forbes as the most vulnerable  Democrat in the House, but they agree that his race is a tossup and one of the quirkier battles of the year.</p>
        <p>''Mike Forbes is in a singularly unenviable position this political year,'' John Kohut wrote in July in The Rothenberg Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter that handicaps political races.</p>
        <p>''There are some in his newly adopted party who care less about the Democrats' 'big picture' in Washington, and can only regard him as an old adversary,'' the report notes. ''Then there are Forbes's old allies in the G.O.P. who see him as the worst type of turncoat and want to see him humiliated and defeated.''</p>
        <p>In July 1999, Mr. Forbes, 48, stunned his colleagues when he announced he was leaving the Republican Party -- the party in power in the House -- to become a Democrat. Standing outside his home in Quogue, on Long Island, Mr. Forbes, a product of Republican machine politics, unleashed a blistering assessment of his former party, calling it ''angry, narrow-minded, intolerant, uncaring, incapable of governing at all, much less from the center.''</p>
        <p>The move all but guaranteed a scorched-earth campaign for his seat this year, and Republican leaders lost no time preparing for it. They described him as petulant and unprincipled, a man who fled only because he felt unloved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes had already drawn their ire in 1996, when he became the first Republican to say that he would oppose Mr. Gingrich's second term as House speaker. But Mr. Gingrich was re-elected, and Mr. Forbes, a onetime Gingrich disciple, was snubbed.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Forbes, who won his first two terms with 53 percent and 55 percent of the vote, was re-elected in 1998 with 64 percent. The First District, home to the Hamptons, Brookhaven National Laboratory and military plants, is politically Republican, but President Clinton carried it in 1996.</p>
        <p>Looking back at his defection, Mr. Forbes says he harbors no regrets and describes those Republican labels as bunk. ''If I wanted to be purely political and fake, clearly I wouldn't have done what I did a year ago,' he said. ''I was in the majority, in the top committee in the House. I was, in most people's estimation, a shoo-in for re-election. But there has to be more to this business than just raw politics.''</p>
        <p>Election years, though, thrive on raw politics, and Mr. Forbes faces a nasty race, full of hurdles, all of them rooted in his party switch.</p>
        <p>Democrats were naturally not happy about supporting a former rival candidate, especially one who opposes abortion rights and voted to impeach the president. With help from national party leaders, Mr. Forbes persuaded almost all of them to overcome their reluctance, although he faces a nominal primary fight against a Democrat who is an abortion-rights advocate.</p>
        <p>Then, in a public tiff, Mr. Forbes further unnerved Democrats by seeking the endorsement of the local Right to Life Party. In the end, the endorsement went to Mr. Grucci. Mr. Forbes was also rebuffed by the Conservative Party and the Independent Party, whose support he had in the last election.</p>
        <p>''The so-called regular Democrats -- the apparatchiks -- are fairly solidly behind him,'' said Brad O'Hearn, a spokesman for the Suffolk County Democratic Party. ''There are some interest groups that still have bones to pick with him. But he is meeting with them.''</p>
        <p>For the most part, the Grucci campaign portrays Mr. Forbes as an out-of-touch Washington politician who betrayed Republican principles. ''Mike Forbes will say or do anything for his own political expediency,'' said Mr. Grucci, who handily won re-election twice as supervisor of Brookhaven, the largest town in Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes has not stayed silent, though. He and other Democrats portray his opponent as out of his league in Washington and question how much he knew about a political scandal that sent a local Republican chairman to prison.</p>
        <p>As he campaigns about town, Mr. Forbes makes a simple pitch: He is the same man he was before, an advocate of tax cuts, gun control, a clean environment and -- a Forbes position even before he switched parties -- the Democratic Party's solution for overhauling managed care.</p>
        <p>And he does not shy away from lambasting his former Republican colleagues for pursuing him with such relish. ''We are going to have a real battle on our hands,'' Mr. Forbes said. ''There is a viciousness, there is a hatred, there is a visceral need for the national Republicans in the House to kill me off because they want to make an example out of me.''</p>
        <p>''And,'' he said, optimistically, ''it's going to backfire on them.''</p>
