        <p>Beaucaire, on the banks of the Rhone, owes its exquisite beauty to the palmy years of the 17th and 18th centuries when all European trade heading for the Mediterranean Sea had to stop there. An architectural jewel in the heart of Provence, Beaucaire was pretty much left to decay when its fortunes turned some 150 years ago. Its tarnished reputation grew worse in the last 40 years as low-income housing began to creep into the city center. Now the town fathers are hoping to change this image by offering newly renovated historical buildings to artists and artisans for monthly rents of less than 25 cents a square foot. At those prices, why not go for 6,400 square feet of studio space, as Mark Stuart, an Australian artist, did. He has moved into a 17th-century building overlooking a tranquil square in the heart of town. And officials are also hoping to make it easy for artists and artisans to buy. Beaucaire's winding streets, basking in the hot southern sun, have Roman roots, medieval touches and an abundance of stunning mansions from the grand period of commercial glory. Under the plan devised by the local government, even foreign applicants can qualify. They just have to be officially recognized as artists or artisans. This could be life-changing information.</p>
