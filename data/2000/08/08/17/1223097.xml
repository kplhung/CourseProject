        <p>ABOUT half of all American households now have personal computers, a trend that is astonishing considering that PC's are expensive, complicated and unreliable, compared with other household appliances. Conversely, about half of all homes have managed to resist buying computers until now. That annoys the Microsoft Corporation, which hates the idea of the country being divided in two. (Microsoft hates the idea of anything being divided in two.)</p>
        <p>Microsoft's mission statement calls for a computer -- Windows-based, naturally -- in every home. That sounds like a swell idea to Compaq, the world's largest maker of Windows-powered PC's. So earlier this week, Compaq and Microsoft teamed up to introduce the iPAQ Home Internet Appliance IA-1, a $199 home computer designed for people who don't like computers.</p>
        <p>Actually, Compaq prefers not to call it a computer, referring to it instead as ''the Internet in a box.''</p>
        <p>The catch is that to get the iPAQ IA-1 for $199 requires a three-year commitment to Microsoft's MSN Internet service, which is $21.95 a month, raising the total cost of the Internet in a Box to nearly $1,000. If the buyer doesn't sign up for three years of MSN, this cute little cow pie of a computer costs a ridiculous $599. Even then, the owner will have to have an MSN account to use it.</p>
        <p>But if someone already has an MSN account, there would be no need to buy the iPAQ. Obviously, Compaq sees its audience as first-time buyers.</p>
        <p>Either way, some people may be willing to pay this much for a device that is so simple to use. Much better computers are available for less money, but they do not offer the push-button ease of the iPAQ. Think of the price as a simplicity tax.</p>
        <p>The iPAQ Home Internet Appliance IA-1 belongs to a new category of devices called Internet appliances, which are stripped-down computers designed to handle e-mail, World Wide Web browsing, online shopping and a few other simple tasks without the cost or complexity of a personal computer.</p>
        <p>Specifically, the iPAQ IA-1 is the first member of a subspecies of Internet appliances called MSN Companions. Several other computer makers, including eMachines, have signed up to make Internet appliances that link directly to Microsoft's MSN network.</p>
        <p>Gateway, a Compaq rival, has a similar alliance with America Online, an MSN rival. The Gateway-AOL appliance is expected to reach the market later this year, as will an improved model of the original Internet appliance, the Netpliance i-Opener.</p>
        <p>According to Microsoft, most of the people who do not have computers say they would like to have access to e-mail and the Internet. They just don't like computers, which cost too much, break down too often and are too darned intimidating. (Microsoft blames the hardware for that, of course, which is almost as amusing as the $599 price tag for the iPAQ Home Internet Appliance IA-1.)</p>
        <p>The role model for information appliances is the television set, which is relatively cheap and simple to set up, turns on and off instantly with the touch of a button, rarely breaks down and does not require mastery of a lot of technical hocus-pocus. The TV set is not particularly smart, but it does not have to be because all the information it displays is pulled down from the network.</p>
        <p>The iPAQ IA-1 works the same way, sort of. It has no floppy drive, no hard disk and no CD-ROM drive, all of which are standard equipment on other Windows-based home PC's. It has a feeble little brain with 32 megabytes of memory, but it doesn't need much more because almost all of its consciousness is derived from the Internet.</p>
        <p>To keep things simple -- and to create a direct link between Microsoft and your wallet -- the iPaq uses a stripped-down version of Windows called Windows CE. The only major application on the system is a generation-old Internet Explorer 4.0 Web browser, a Microsoft product that automatically steers the user to the MSN home page.</p>
        <p>Microsoft calls this software bundle an MSN Companion.</p>
        <p>Heaven forbid you should decide that you want to try America Online or Napster or Quicken or some other infidel software. Because the iPAQ IA-1 has no local storage drives, the owner cannot download and store files from the Internet or install other applications, like games, educational software or personal finance programs. Nor can the owner accidentally erase or move an obscure Windows file. ''This makes MSN Companion devices very reliable,'' Microsoft says in material prepared for reviewers. It also makes the device a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft.</p>
        <p>MSN is actually the best thing about this little box. Although only a fraction of the size of America Online, MSN offers a broad array of interesting services, most of which are accessible through the iPAQ.</p>
        <p>The iPAQ Home Internet Appliance IA-1 -- the awkward name suggests that more, and perhaps cheaper, Compaq home Internet appliances are in the works -- is a bone-colored, two-piece contraption that is small enough to fit easily on a kitchen counter. It's about the size of the average pocketbook. It has an adjustable 10-inch (measured diagonally) color flat-panel display screen, which is small even when compared with the screens on laptop computers. To save costs, the iPAQ uses a passive matrix screen, which is just barely acceptable for e-mail and Web browsing.</p>
        <p>It has a 56K dial-up modem, a scratchy mono speaker and four U.S.B. ports for attaching optional peripherals like an Epson 740 inkjet printer (the only model it works with at this time), JBL speakers and a  mouse. The most intriguing feature is a Compact Flash Type 2 memory card slot, which has no use at this point. Presumably Compaq and Microsoft have grand plans for it.</p>
        <p>The wireless keyboard is 13 inches wide and 7 inches deep. Pressing on a rubber nipple about the size of a nickel controls the cursor on the iPAQ's display screen if you don't want to use a mouse. In my tests, the cursor control was clumsy and erratic. On the bright side, the keyboard has a series of buttons dedicated to specific tasks, which reduces the need to use the built-in pointing device.</p>
        <p>One task button takes the user to a personal MSN home page, which can be customized to display local weather and news, a stock portfolio and other useful information. Another automatically opens the MSN Hotmail e-mail service, which is set up for the people who buy iPAQ's. There are buttons dedicated to news (MSNBC), finance (MSN Money Central) and instant messages (MSN Instant Messaging, which is not compatible with AOL's much more popular service, but only because AOL will not allow it). There are also buttons for online shopping (MSN eShop), searching (MSN Search) -- get the picture? -- Compaq technical support, printing and tracking down music files. You can listen to the music, but you can't store it.</p>
        <p>Although the personal MSN Web page is fixed as the default home page, users can go to any Web sites after they are online. There is also a button for storing favorite Web destinations. Microsoft has stocked that feature with sites that include maps, weather, greeting cards, Oprah's Books and Third Age, a Web site designed for ''first-wave baby boomers.'' Huh?</p>
        <p>One day earlier this week, the headlines on Third Age's home page pointed to rather explicit descriptions of how to improve your sex life.  While I am grateful for Microsoft's thoughtfulness in including this Web site among the six preloaded favorites, perhaps that is not the greatest bookmark for a family computer.</p>
        <p>The ''instant on'' appeal of the iPAQ IA-1 depends entirely on your definition of ''instant.'' In my tests, it took almost 60 seconds after the power button was pushed for the home page to finish loading, and that is much quicker than the startup time for a standard Windows computer. But if it took 60 seconds to turn on a TV or get a dial tone, people would riot.</p>
        <p>The bottom line is that the iPAQ Home Internet Appliance IA-1 MSN Companion is an awfully big name for such a little computer. When the three-year commitment to MSN is factored in, it will cost nearly $1,000 for this little Schmoo of a device. Compaq and Microsoft appear to be anticipating that people will be willing to pay extra for simplicity, even if it severely limits the things they can do.</p>
        <p>When you consider that AltaVista and other companies offer free (but advertising-supported) Internet access for PC's and Macs, that a new iMac computer costs $799 and that a complete 600-megahertz Hewlett-Packard Pavilion system with a monitor and a printer can be had for less than $900, it becomes very difficult to justify the cost of the stripped-down iPAQ.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, it comes from Texas, it isn't exceptionally bright, and W (for Windows) is its middle initial. Heck, it might be a winner after all.</p>
