      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Thirteen years ago, an Aix-en-Provence company called Carocim brought back traditional cement tiles, which had been hugely popular in the mid-19th century. They are made to last a lifetime. Christian Bertheas, the company's owner, says, ''The best advertising I have are the happy clients who see their tiles become more beautiful right before their eyes as a natural patina develops with wear.'' Carocim tiles (from $4 for a plain 8-by-8-inch tile to $6.50 for a frieze tile with elements imitated from Matisse; shipping extra) are in New York, to the trade only, at Studio 11, 250 West 50th Street; (212) 387-8786.</p>
