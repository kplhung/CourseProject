        <p>Bob Colarossi, the president of USA Gymnastics, spent much of today defending the subjective process in the selection of the women's Olympic team. While the men's team is comprised of the top four overall finishers from the combined results of both the nationals and the Olympic trials, and two additional gymnasts picked by a committee, the women's team is less structured.</p>
        <p>The results from nationals and the trials weigh heavily, but they are not binding. A committee, which includes the national team coordinator Bela Karolyi, will meet after the conclusion of the trials Sunday and pick six gymnasts. It is possible, though unlikely, that a gymnast could make the team without finishing the competition.</p>

It is possible, though unlikely, that a gymnast could make the team without finishing the competition.</p>
        <p>Until now, every athlete that made the team competed on every apparatus. Now, there are six women on each team, five competing on each apparatus and four scores will count. Now, specialists on certain apparatus are more key.</p>
