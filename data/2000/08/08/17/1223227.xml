        <p>KARENNA GORE SCHIFF  Remarks last night about her father, Vice President Al Gore, at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles:</p>
        <p>''My dad learned from childhood about the dignity working people have. My grandparents taught my dad that it is right to treat every woman and man with equal respect; to call them Sir or Ma'am; to do your own physical labor, and clean up your own mess.</p>
        <p>I see a lot of my grandfather in my father. He believes in taking the hard road when that's the road that will take us to higher ground. And I think his old-fashioned politeness is refreshing in today's world. . . .</p>
        <p>My dad has always been there for us, too, whether it was the breakfasts he made for us every morning before school, toast, with lots of butter, or the way he told my two sisters and me, as well as our brother, that we could be whatever we wanted to be in life.</p>
        <p>One time, he came home after a long day of hearings and meetings and votes and found me struggling to begin that all-important elementary school assignment: the dinosaur diorama.</p>
        <p>He was tired, but while my mom was getting the others to brush their teeth and get in bed, my dad was the one who took me down to the store to get the emergency Q-Tips, colored Play-Doh, and construction paper, because he was simply being a dad.</p>
