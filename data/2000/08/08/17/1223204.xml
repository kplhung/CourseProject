        <p>Mr. McCain's doctors have said that he was cured of the melanoma that they removed from his left shoulder in 1993.

        <p>Whenever people develop melanoma, as Senator John McCain of Arizona did in 1993, they are told to check the moles on their skin for changes and have their doctors monitor them for signs of a recurrence, as well as for new skin cancers.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain's doctors have said that he was cured of the melanoma that they removed from his left shoulder in 1993. But until more information is disclosed about the two new melanomas that Mr. McCain's office said were detected in biopsies on Aug. 3, it is not known whether they are similar to the curable one he had in 1993, or are more ominous.</p>
        <p>Doctors can sometimes tell from the appearance of a melanoma whether it is more likely to be a new one or to have spread.</p>
        <p>New melanomas tend to be asymmetrical with irregular edges and those that have spread, or metastasized, may be raised and can often be black, said Dr. Bernard S. Goffe, a dermatologist in Seattle, who is not connected with Mr. McCain's case.</p>
        <p>But, Dr. Goffe said, a definitive answer can come only from a pathologist's examination of cell patterns in the new melanomas, after a biopsy.</p>
        <p>Having one melanoma slightly raises the risk of developing another melanoma, but an even greater chance of developing less serious basal cell skin cancers.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain's new melanomas were on his left arm and left temple. The temple is a common site for new melanomas. If the new melanoma on his arm is close to the site of the one removed from his left shoulder, there is a greater likelihood that it is a recurrence or has spread.</p>
        <p>If the melanomas are new ones and similar to the one removed in 1993, the statistical chances for a cure is high. But if one or both of the new melanomas has spread from elsewhere, the chances of a five-year survival are about 50 percent, Dr. Goffe said.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain will undergo tests to detect spread.</p>
        <p>Last December, when Mr. McCain was running for the Republican presidential nomination, Dr. Thomas M. Hudak, a plastic surgeon who removed Mr. McCain's melanoma in 1993, and Dr. John Eckstein, Mr. McCain's physician at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., said in interviews that the senator's melanoma was cured.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hudak said then that Mr. McCain's last checkup was in October 1999.</p>
