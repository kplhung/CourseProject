        <p>JEW VS. JEW  The Struggle for the Soul of American Jewry  By Samuel G. Freedman  397 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $26.</p>
        <p>''I have nothing in common with the Jews,'' Franz Kafka wrote crankily in his diary. ''Most days I don't even have anything in common with myself.'' Kafka's complaint is funny in part because it is so familiarly Jewish -- Moses, who tried to talk God out of choosing him as a prophet, might have said as much. But for Samuel G. Freedman, the fact that Jews don't get along is no laughing matter. Invoking dire images of the fall of the Second Temple -- for which Jewish tradition blames religious disunity -- Mr. Freedman believes that American Jews have nothing less than a civil war on their hands.</p>
        <p>To support this thesis, Mr. Freedman -- a former reporter for The New York Times and the author of several books, including a compelling portrait of a black church in East New York -- focuses on some recent episodes of American Jewish strife. These include the collapse of a conversion panel in Denver made up of Orthodox, Conservative and Reform rabbis; the lawsuit of five Orthodox students who wished to avoid co-ed housing at Yale; a quarrel at a California synagogue over liturgical emendation; and a zoning battle in a Ohio suburb that pitted Jews of various affiliations against Orthodox residents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freedman, who is also a professor of journalism, builds his portraits with great care. He has clearly done a vast amount of reporting and research and has rooted his study in the history of modern America. He strengthens his accounts of individuals with an understanding of the communities they live in. He is good at tracing the way a suburb grows from a few houses to a full-fledged community and how the tenuous balance of ethnic fellowship is maintained -- and disturbed. He evokes the simultaneous loss and transfiguration that characterizes the immigrant journey into American success.</p>
        <p>But it is the eruption of discord that Mr. Freedman sees as representative of American Judaism, and his chapters are bent around this thesis. This can give his examples a somewhat forced quality. The lawsuit conducted by the ''Yale Five'' was, after all, aimed at Yale University; the fact that the dean of students and the president of the university were Jewish, something Mr. Freedman makes much of, seems oddly irrelevant.</p>
        <p>A battle at a Los Angeles synagogue over inclusion of the matriarchs alongside the names of the patriarchs in the Amida, the centerpiece of synagogue liturgy -- though it stirred the passions of the congregation -- hardly seems a schismatic matter. One need only think of the fate of Maimonides, the great medieval Jewish philosopher, whose compilation of Jewish law, the Mishneh Torah, was burnt as heretical when it first appeared, to realize how mild much American Jewish discord is.</p>
        <p>Far more dramatic is the chapter that deals with the planting of a bomb in a Florida synagogue to protest the appearance of Shimon Peres and the Oslo accords he participated in. The act is presented as an emblematic episode, yet the Orthodox Jew who hid the bomb seems to have had a history of emotional disturbance, the rabbi of the synagogue he attended was the one who tipped off the authorities, and the bomber himself fully expected the bomb would be found. (He called the police).</p>
        <p>The event, though it undoubtedly resonates more grimly after the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, has a completely different character from that calamity, despite Mr. Freedman's implication that Israeli religious discord is finding an echo in the United States. Indeed the assassination of Rabin may say more about how Israel has become like the United States than a bomb in a Florida synagogue shows how the country is becoming like Israel. In Israel, where Orthodox Jews have a share of political power and government-sanctioned authority, the notion of religious civil war is far more relevant. The rise of the Orthodox right wing in the United States, which Mr. Freedman intelligently chronicles, may say as much about American fundamentalist culture as it does about Judaism.</p>
        <p>None of this is to suggest that there aren't real issues dividing American Jews. Mr. Freedman, an excellent journalist, is surely on the trail of a good story. But he has defined that story, and in some sense religious life itself, so narrowly that American Jews are all drafted by his book into conflicts that many may feel touch only peripherally on their religious lives.</p>
        <p>This is especially apparent in several of his conclusions. He speaks of the triumph of the ''Orthodox model,'' by which he means the notion that ''religion defines Jewish identity.'' This may come as a shock to a large number of Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist Jews, not to mention unaffiliated Jews with deep religious identities. It is one thing to claim that secular Judaism has fizzled as a movement. It is another to confuse religious life with Orthodoxy. This is a particularly ironic conclusion given Mr. Freedman's own understanding that millions of Jews who poured into this country as immigrants in the early part of this century and promptly vanished into assimilated culture were, by and large, the products of Orthodox families. Was that the failure of the Orthodox model?</p>
        <p>The boundaries of Judaism seem far more fluid than Mr. Freedman would have us believe, even today.  Mr. Freedman is no doubt right that Israel once rallied American Jews in a way it now fails to, but it is also true that Zionism itself has been, since the beginning of the 20th century, a deeply divisive issue for Jews. But perhaps all this is a way of quarreling with the subtitle of this book, which implies a monolithic community capable of a single soul. American Judaism may well have as many souls as it has bodies, a fact that no doubt argues for the health of the religion.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Freedman provides a thought-provoking and timely tour of Jewish-American religious ferment. Whether the conflicts he chronicles are a throwback to earlier struggles, an omen of a coming crisis, or the necessary accompaniment of the development of a living faith is, of course, a matter of opinion.</p>
