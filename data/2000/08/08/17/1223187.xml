        <p>Standing next to the entrance of a Brooklyn subway station on a recent sweltering morning, Representative Edolphus Towns shook hands with the last in a trickling stream of rush hour workers and paused to make an observation about his campaign.</p>
        <p>''Last time, I didn't do too much of this,'' the 66-year-old congressman said of his last primary race, in 1998. ''But this time is different. I'm out here, and I'm focused.''</p>
        <p>In that Democratic primary two years ago, he received just 52 percent of the vote, making it the weakest showing of any incumbent member of Congress that year. Now, Mr. Towns, an 18-year incumbent who has been immersed in Brooklyn politics for a generation, is looking for a victory that will be overwhelming.</p>
        <p>Unlike that three-way primary in 1998, Mr. Towns this year is facing just one opponent: Barry D. Ford, 37, a lawyer. Mr. Ford came in second to Mr. Towns in that earlier race, with 36 percent of the vote. Virtually since the returns were counted two years ago, Mr. Ford has been working nearly nonstop at a second chance to oppose Mr. Towns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford, a Harvard graduate who also graduated from the university's law school, says a one-on-one race against the congressman makes his prospects far brighter. He believes  Mr. Towns is highly vulnerable.</p>
        <p>''This time, I think it is easier for me to win,'' Mr. Ford said. ''But challenging an incumbent is never easy. The fundamental thing I have to do is to become even better known. And I am doing door-to-door and have devised an extensive field operation. This is a ground campaign, and I'm meeting as many people as I can.''</p>
        <p>While both candidates have put together an army of volunteers and have raised sizable amounts of money, they have each taken to the streets of the 10th Congressional District with a frenzy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford, in meeting with voters in the heavily Democratic district, lists a battery of complaints against the incumbent congressman. Foremost is highlighting Mr. Towns's 1997 endorsement of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican.</p>
        <p>''Given the treatment of the mayor to this particular part of New York City, that endorsement is inexplicable,'' Mr. Ford said. He also accused Mr. Towns of being silent during the highly public accusations of police misconduct against black and Hispanic New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>''He did not participate in any of the protests about Diallo, Louima or Dorismond,'' he said, referring to two unarmed black men, Amadou Diallo and Patrick M. Dorismond, who were killed by New York City police officers, and to a third black man, Abner Louima, who was tortured in a Brooklyn police station.  ''And that's because of his cozy relationship with Mayor Giuliani.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford asserts that the congressman's record had been lackluster, complaining that Mr. Towns missed about one in seven votes in his 18 years in Congress. ''And in the last 18 years, he has been the prime sponsor of only two bills and two amendments,'' Mr. Ford said.</p>
        <p>He also chastised Mr. Towns for accepting tobacco industry campaign contributions, saying the congressman has voted against restrictions on tobacco use and for federally supported tobacco crop insurance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford said he would push for more federal money for school construction and teacher training and to begin the process again for an empowerment zone in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Towns has acknowledged that his endorsement of Mr. Giuliani has placed him on the defensive in a Congressional district where the mayor received about a third of the vote in the last mayoral election. But he said he was motivated to endorse Mr. Giuliani as a means of gaining his cooperation on securing a federal empowerment zone, where public funds are used to spur commercial redevelopment.</p>
        <p>''As it turned out, we didn't get the empowerment zone and so I don't feel good about it,'' he said of the Giuliani endorsement. ''If I had gotten the empowerment zone, it would have been a different story.</p>
        <p>Mr. Towns said that at the urging of his staff, he would not accept money from tobacco companies this year. The congressman, a Baptist minister born in North Carolina, said he remained sympathetic to the concerns of the tobacco industry. ''When you look at tobacco companies, they are conglomerates that get money from all kinds of businesses,'' he said. ''I have family and friends who are involved in tobacco for their livelihood. It's a complicated issue.''</p>
        <p>On his work in Congress, Mr. Towns said that he had been an effective congressman and that he had high ratings from labor unions, health care workers and education groups. ''I have a 100 percent voting record on every major vote,'' Mr. Towns said. ''Some votes are procedural votes that are less significant. I have an A rating with all of these groups. They must feel that I have the ability to lead.''</p>
        <p>He added that he was at the forefront on several economic developments in Brooklyn, principally the Metrotech Center, an office complex. Mr. Towns also flashed campaign literature that included an endorsement from Mr. Louima, saying he had been involved in behind-the-scenes meetings with officials at the Justice Department about police abuses.</p>
        <p>''That's the way I work,'' he said. ''I don't jump up for the cameras.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Towns said his 52 percent showing two years ago was largely the result of his having been preoccupied with assisting in the re-election campaign of his son, Darryl C. Towns, a member of the State Assembly. The younger Mr. Towns had faced a bitter campaign against Martin Malave-Dilan, a city councilman and former ally of the Towns family.</p>
        <p>While the younger Mr. Towns is once again facing Mr. Malave-Dilan in an Assembly primary, the congressman is not managing that campaign this year. Therefore, he maintained, he will devote more time in the primary against Mr. Ford.</p>
        <p>By Mr. Towns's own forecast, he will double what he spent in the 1998 primary, with a plan to spend $600,000 this year. Mr. Ford said he intended to spend about $250,000.</p>
        <p>The 10th Congressional District stretches from East New York and Bedford-Stuyvesant through Fort Greene into Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill. The district is 56 percent black and about 20 percent Hispanic and 2 percent Asian-American, according to the 1990 census. Non-Hispanic white residents make up 21 percent of the district.</p>
        <p>The battle between Mr. Towns and Mr. Ford, unlike high-profile statewide races, will not be waged through television advertising, but by door-to-door campaigning and mailings specifically aimed at voters identified by the candidates as likely supporters. And so it is a typical New York City campaign, almost entirely on the streets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Towns said that was the reason he had returned to active campaigning in neighborhoods. ''I will meet Barry Ford at every corner, every civic association meeting and every subway stop,'' the congressman said. ''This time, I will be everywhere in this district. And everyone will know it.''</p>
