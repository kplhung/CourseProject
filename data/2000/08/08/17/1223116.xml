        <p>Look Again  The cloth-covered table, the garment draped casually over a chair, the family portraits, seem like everyday objects. In fact, they are sculptured from colored marble. Inspired by the work of Italian artisans of the Renaissance, the objects are made by the Yonkers sculptor Barbara Segal. They will be on display through Oct. 29 in an installation called ''Staged in Stone,'' at the Neuberger Museum of Art at State University College at Purchase, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Change of Scene  The Jewish Repertory Theater is on the move, shifting its base from the Upper East Side to the bustling new 42nd Street. Beginning with the opening attraction of its 2000-01 season, the Oct. 10 world premiere of ''The Big Potato,'' a play by Arthur Laurents, the repertory theater will become a tenant of the new Duke Theater, a 199-seat house on the second floor of the Duke Building at 229 West 42nd Street, a project of the New 42nd Street Development Corporation. Ran Avni, the founder and artistic director of the Jewish Repertory Theater, called the move to Midtown from its home since 1993, the 288-seat Playhouse 91 at 316 East 91st Street in Yorkville , ''an extraordinary opportunity.'' The season's attractions include the first New York revival of the 1970 Richard Rodgers-Martin Charnin-Peter Stone musical ''Two by Two'' and two other productions that are to be announced.</p>

        <p>Anchors Aweigh  Oils and watercolors by John Frederick Kensett, Alfred Bricher and James Buttersworth highlight ''Under Sail: Marine Art From Private Collections,'' a new exhibition in the Ethel H. Blum Gallery at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Me. Many of the 19th- and 20th-century oils and watercolors in this show, which includes ship portraits, Currier and Ives prints and nautical artifacts, have rarely been publicly displayed. The show runs through Sept. 9.</p>
        <p>Times Three  In midsummer, why not a production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''? That idea seems to have occurred simultaneously in several places, which accounts for three new versions of the play. Through mid-September, around the trees and rooftops of its courtyard at 432 West 42nd Street, the Pulse Ensemble Theater is presenting a version set in the Roaring Twenties as part of its Outdoor Shakespeare Series. Through Sept. 16 at La Plaza Cultural, Avenue C at Ninth Street in the East Village, a Blunt Theater Company production is alternating with Euripides' ''Bacchae.'' And under the title ''A Midsommer Nights Dreame'' and using the First Folio, a rough compilation of the original scripts, the Kings County Shakespeare Company is presenting it in repertory with Richard Brinsley Sheridan's ''Rivals,'' through Sept. 2 at Founders Hall Theater of St. Francis College, 182 Remsen Street in Brooklyn Heights.</p>
