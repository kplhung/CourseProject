        <p>THE temptation is to ignore this. To look the other way. To say there he goes again, not many people read his paper anyway, it doesn't matter.</p>
        <p>But it does matter that the oldest black weekly in New York told its dwindling readership that Vice President Al Gore picked a Jewish running mate for the money. For the Jewish money. So states the editorial in the Aug. 10-16 issue of The Amsterdam News, written by Wilbert A. Tatum, publisher emeritus: ''Gore and his minions did it for the money.''</p>
        <p>There's more. ''The reasoning in the Gore camp went out all over the world to Jews of means: You've got to show me the money. When you do, one of yours will be given the second spot on the ticket. The word went out all over the world to Jews in every pocket of civilization and near-civilization, that the major protector of Jews in this world, the American government, is now available. But in order to get it, you've got to buy it.''</p>
        <p>And: ''Jews from all over the world, especially in Europe, Africa, Israel and South America, will be sending bundles of money.''</p>
        <p>Jews. Money. Power. Surely Mr. Tatum could have come up with something more subtle.</p>
        <p>Or maybe he didn't want to. ''He knew exactly what he was doing,'' said Abraham Foxman, executive director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. ''The language in this editorial is the worst anti-Semitic rhetoric that I have read in a long time, unless I want to plug into a hate Web site.''</p>
        <p>In a letter to the newspaper, the Anti-Defamation League called the Tatum editorial ''insidious, and an anti-Semitic canard employed by anti-Semites, racists and conspiracy theorists through the centuries to bolster their absurd claim of Jewish control.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tatum, and his daughter Elinor Tatum, publisher and editor in chief, did not return a phone call from The Times yesterday. Mr. Tatum denied the charge of anti-Semitism in yesterday's Daily News, noting that his wife and daughter are Jewish, which is what he has said on the many previous occasions he's been accused of anti-Semitism.</p>
        <p>What to say about this? Mainly that it is sad. It is troubling but not shocking to hear bias from Louis Farrakhan, who questioned last week whether Joseph I. Lieberman would be more loyal to Israel than to his own country. It is troubling, too, to hear the president of the Dallas N.A.A.C.P., Lee Alcorn, call the Lieberman choice ''suspicious'' because the interest of Jews ''primarily has to do with money and these kinds of things.'' The national president of the N.A.A.C.P., Kweisi Mfume, condemned the remarks and formally suspended Mr. Alcorn, who then resigned.</p>
        <p>But to read Mr. Tatum's tendentious words is beyond troubling. It is disappointing, especially in New York, with its optimistic pretensions of tolerance.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Mr. Tatum was looking for attention. In a way, that would be better than if he really believes what he wrote. There are many many things wrong with Mr. Gore's fund-raising techniques, but the Tatum theory would be laughable if it wasn't so hurtful. His newspaper has little influence left. The latest official audit shows that the circulation of The Amsterdam News is down to 19,568 from 25,962 just two years ago. It was 58,907 in 1977.</p>
        <p>BUT Mr. Tatum's words, however few they reach, feed tensions between Jews and blacks, and perpetuate stereotypes that cross racial and religious lines. They even pop up on network television: Bill Maher, of ABC's ''Politically Incorrect,'' has managed to find humor in Jews' alleged love of money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore obviously calculated that anti-Semitism was not a major political factor, or at least would be balanced in the election by what he saw as Mr. Lieberman's strengths. We won't know until November, since people lie in polls about race and religion, but clearly there are still problems.</p>
        <p>''For blacks and Jews to be constantly pitted against each other is ridiculous,'' said Dennis Walcott, president of the New York Urban League. He declined to characterize the Tatum piece. So did the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who said in Los Angeles that while he did not share Mr. Tatum's point of view, he respected the concept of free speech.</p>
        <p>''Gore, in a bold affirmative action, broke the quota of zero to make sure an American Jew would be on the ticket,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''That's what affirmative action is. It breaks the barriers of exclusion.''</p>
        <p>It looks as though it's even more difficult to break down the barriers of entrenched bias.</p>
