        <p>The standing may not have shown much change, but the Mets were feeling pretty good about themselves entering last night's game at Shea. They had completed a doubleheader sweep for the third time this season on Tuesday. But the tiniest things can turn a team's momentum. It can be the starting pitcher, or even a matter of inches.</p>
        <p>The Mets were done in by both last night, and slipped in both playoff races. Their 7-5 loss to the Rockies dropped them three games behind the Atlanta Braves in the National League East. Their lead in the N.L. wild-card race slipped to four games over the Arizona Diamondbacks.</p>

        <p>The standing may not have shown much change, but the Mets were feeling pretty good about themselves entering last night's game at Shea. They had completed a doubleheader sweep for the third time this season on Tuesday. But the tiniest things can turn a team's momentum. It can be the starting pitcher, or even a matter of inches.</p>
        <p>The Mets were done in by both last night, and slipped in both playoff races. Their 7-5 loss to the Rockies dropped them three games behind the Atlanta Braves in the National League East. Their lead in the N.L. wild-card race slipped to four games over the Arizona Diamondbacks.</p>
        <p>Mets starter Glendon Rusch could have pitched better, but even he is  starting to feel that things don't fall his way when he pitches. Certainly, reliever Rick White could have done better. White entered with a 4-1 deficit in the eighth and allowed the Rockies to score three more runs.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most helpless feeling was experienced by the six Mets who watched pitches they thought were balls and were called third strikes by the home-plate umpire,  Brian Runge. Only two Rockies struck out looking.</p>
        <p>Robin Ventura calmly argued with Runge after the highlight call. The Mets had rallied for four runs in the eighth inning on homers by Kurt Abbott and Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza's sprint from first base to home. They turned a 7-1 game to 7-5 and had Todd Zeile standing at second base.</p>
        <p>With the Rockies' bullpen again about to implode, the left-handed reliever Gabe White entered. Ventura lined White's first pitch foul, sending the first-base umpire Ian Lamplugh sprawling. Ventura swung through White's next pitch before taking the third on the inside part of the plate. Runge called it a strike, ending the Mets' only scoring threat of the game.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was a ball, and he thought it was otherwise,'' Ventura said.</p>
        <p>Payton bent over in disgust when he struck out looking to lead off the ninth. Derek Bell twice looked at pitches for third strikes.</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine said Runge had a large strike zone. Asked if it was consistent for both teams, Valentine simply said, ''It was pretty big,'' and added that his players were probably justified in arguing.</p>
        <p>Rusch has a respectable 4.42 E.R.A., but dropped to 8-10 last night. Rusch was charged with six runs in seven-plus innings, the most runs he has allowed since he gave up seven on July 2 against the Braves.</p>
        <p>''It's tough,'' Rusch said. ''It's frustrating. When we get some momentum going it feels like it turns the other way sometimes when I go out there.''</p>
        <p>Rusch allowed Neifi Perez a first-inning homer on a first-pitch fastball, and then matched Rockies starter Brian Bohanon through the fifth inning. The Mets had tied the game on an unearned run in the first and Rusch held it. In the sixth, Rusch labored to get the third out. With two outs and a runner on first base, Rusch tried throwing side-armed to .400-flirting Todd Helton. Rusch was looking for a sinker and a ground ball, but the ball ended up on Helton's right elbow. Helton merely turned to let the ball bounce off.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Hammonds, who entered hitting .358 with 19 homers, singled to left-center, breaking the tie. With Helton on third, Hammonds stole second base without a throw. Larry Walker followed by lining Rusch's 3-2 high fastball to the opposite field. As the ball fell into left, Helton and Hammonds scored without a throw for a 4-1 Rockies lead.</p>
        <p>Helton went 1 for 4 with a double, dropping his average to .395.</p>
        <p>Rusch was trying to win consecutive starts for the first time since June, but even the usually reliable bullpen let him down. With the Rockies ahead, 4-1, in the eighth, Terry Shumpert's single and Helton's double put runners on second and third and forced the Mets to call for White. Hammonds lined a single into left-center to score two more runs.</p>
        <p>White had allowed only one run in his previous six outings as a Met. Last night, he had the misfortune of allowing a run-scoring single to Bohanon with two outs in the eighth inning.</p>
        <p>Rusch and White were no match for Bohanon, the former Met who held them to four runs in seven and two-thirds innings. After allowing Alfonzo's two-run homer in the eighth, Bohanon left for Mike DeJean, who allowed a single to Piazza.</p>
        <p>Zeile, whose eighth-inning homer Tuesday helped complete a doubleheader sweep of the Rockies, then lined DeJean's 2-2 outside pitch to right-center. With two outs, Piazza was running on the pitch and when center fielder Juan Pierre's dive fell short, Piazza was going home. But the ball died on the outfield grass and Walker threw to the cut-off man Jeff Frye. Piazza's feet-first slide broke through catcher Ben Petrick's block to draw the Mets within two runs.</p>
        <p>Three pitches later, Ventura and the Mets' rally were finished.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The infielder MATT FRANCO cleared outright waivers yesterday and accepted an assignment to Class AAA Norfolk.</p>
