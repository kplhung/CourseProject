        <p>A Suffolk County jury returned a death penalty verdict today against a 39-year-old grocery store clerk convicted of a brutal attack on a female co-worker two years ago.</p>
        <p>The clerk, Nicholson McCoy of East Patchogue, became the third person in Suffolk to be sentenced to death since New York reinstated capital punishment in 1995.</p>
        <p>The same jury of nine men and three women convicted Mr. McCoy of first-degree murder and sodomy last month for attacking Victoria Peymann, 33, of Shirley, in a restroom at an Edwards supermarket in Medford where both worked.</p>
        <p>According to testimony, Mr. McCoy tied up Mrs. Peymann with tape, sodomized her, stuffed her mouth with baby wipes, wrapped her head with more tape, stabbed her twice in the chest and left her trussed-up body in a toilet stall with a rope looped loosely around her neck.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Peymann, a cashier at the store, was married and the mother of a 4-year-old boy and a 2-year-old girl. She was working the overnight shift with Mr. McCoy when the murder occurred about 3 a.m. on Oct. 31, 1998. Authorities said she had taken the job to earn extra money to buy Christmas gifts. Her husband, Hans, is a truck mechanic.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCoy said in a statement that prosecutors presented during the three-week murder trial that he killed Mrs. Peymann during an argument after consensual sex. Prosecutors said evidence showed that this was a lie and that the two did not have a sexual relationship.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Mr. McCoy, Kelley Sharkey of the state's Capital Defender Office, implored jurors to consider Mr. McCoy's troubled upbringing in foster care and asked that they sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>
        <p>The Suffolk County assistant district attorney, Randall Hinrichs, said that jurors told him after giving the death penalty verdict that they were influenced by the violence of the crime, the suffering of the victim and clear evidence that Mr. McCoy had planned the attack. Jurors reached their verdict after 15 hours of deliberation over three days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hinrichs said prosecutors chose to seek the death penalty because of the viciousness of the attack and because ''the defendant had killed before.'' At the time of the murder, Mr. McCoy was on parole after serving a manslaughter sentence for stabbing a man in the Bronx in 1984.</p>
        <p>Previous death sentences in Suffolk County were imposed last year on Robert Shulman, a former postal worker in Hicksville who was convicted of bludgeoning three women to death, and Stephen LaValle of Shirley, who was convicted of raping and murdering a female teacher. Both sentences are being appealed.</p>
