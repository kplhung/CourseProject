        <p>Rank and File Get Star Support</p>
        <p>ROBERT DE NIRO'S TriBeCa Grill was filled Tuesday night with stars invited by PAUL NEWMAN, who called them together for a briefing on the three-month-old strike against the advertising industry.</p>
        <p>The main issue in the strike, which involves 135,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, is how to pay actors for appearing in commercials. Negotiators for the advertising industry have said that they want to do away with longstanding rules governing residuals.</p>
        <p>''I gather that we're kind of at an impasse,'' said JAMES NAUGHTON, who attended the session. ''It means a lot to what they call the rank and file in the union, to know there are guys like Paul who are involved and willing to assume some kind of leadership role.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what it means to the other side. I suspect it can't be good news. We're told they're asking for rollbacks, which doesn't make a lot of sense to those of us in this business at a time when everybody seems to be making more.''</p>
        <p>Among the 40 performers who attended were F. MURRAY ABRAHAM, HARRY BELAFONTE, ASHLEY and NAOMI JUDD, TONY LO BIANCO, BEBE NEUWIRTH, KYRA SEDGWICK, MARISA TOMEI, KATHLEEN TURNER, SAM WATERSTON and Mr. Newman's wife, JOANNE WOODWARD.</p>
        <p>They watched a video that showed OLYMPIA DUKAKIS, BLAIR BROWN, JERRY ORBACH and Mr. Lo Bianco talking about the importance of the union. ''Even though I don't think there were too many people in the room whose immediate livelihoods would have been affected by the outcome of this strike,'' Mr. Waterston said, ''the people who were in the room have a memory, and they know what it was like getting started.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Neuwirth, who said she used to do commercials for household cleaning products, made a similar point. ''The union has helped to protect us now and always through our career,'' she said, ''and we stand with the rank and file.''</p>
        <p>IRA M. SHEPARD, who has represented the advertising industry, said that the goal in changing the way residuals are computed was not to take away residuals altogether.</p>
        <p>''I'm hopeful that when we meet again,'' he said, ''the parties will be able to hammer out an agreement. The only thing we have to have is a modernization of the system.''</p>
        <p>Mae Approves</p>
        <p>CLAUDIA SHEAR, who wrote and stars in the Broadway show ''Dirty Blonde,'' about Mae West, was discussing her plans for the 107th anniversary of Miss West's birth today. The party will have chocolate and nonchocolate cakes. ''I don't know which she'd like best,'' Ms. Shear said yesterday at the Helen Hayes Theater, ''though I know what everyone here would like, because it's a very cake-intensive company.''</p>
        <p>There will also be a dinner with 10 rugby players.</p>
        <p>Rugby players?</p>
        <p>Ms. Shear's explanation included two sentences that sounded like Miss West: ''Cute in shorts. You can tell what a profound understanding of the sport I have.''</p>
        <p>Bar Brawl</p>
        <p>The feud between RANDE GERBER, who runs the slavishly stylish bars in IAN SCHRAGER'S hotels, has moved from New York to Los Angeles, where Mr. Gerber (the husband of CINDY CRAWFORD) is suing Mr. Schrager for breach of contract.</p>
        <p>In May, Mr. Schrager sued Mr. Gerber in New York. Mr. Schrager's lawyer, STANLEY S. ARKIN, called the California lawsuit ''a desperate diversionary response'' to the New York case.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gerber said, ''It is ridiculous for Ian to think I am going to just hand over my businesses that I have worked so hard building for the last 10 years just because he is threatened by my success.''</p>
        <p>In the New York case, Mr. Schrager accused Mr. Gerber of violating their longstanding agreement by arranging deals with two competing hotel owners. In California, Mr. Gerber accused Mr. Schrager of failing to credit Mr. Gerber's Skybar with profits from valet parking, misappropriating revenue from commercials filmed at Skybar and charging Skybar to replace windows in the Mondrian Hotel.</p>
