        <p>Middle linebacker Mike Barrow was the Giants' biggest off-season acquisition, the key to a defense overhauled to stress speed and flexibility. But a sprained right knee has kept Barrow from playing in the preseason until now, and the dynamics of a revised Giants defense have been hard to decipher without him.</p>
        <p>It makes Friday night's Giants-Jets game something more than just Barrow's debut as a Giant. It will be the first time the Giants' new defense has most of its core players. Defensive linemen Michael Strahan and Keith Hamilton, who have each missed a preseason game with minor injuries, should be joining Barrow on the field along with linebacker Jessie Armstead, Barrow's former teammate at the University of Miami.</p>
        <p>It is the tandem of Armstead and Barrow -- ''Batman and Robin,'' in Barrow's words -- that is central to the attacking defensive style the Giants want to play under their defensive coordinator, John Fox.</p>
        <p>''You're always looking for unpredictability,'' Fox said. ''And Mike and Jessie together give us a lot of possibilities that you just keep changing.''</p>
        <p>Barrow will not leave the field in obvious passing situations, as his predecessor at middle linebacker, Corey Widmer, did. Barrow should blitz a lot more often, too. And Barrow's presence might make it easier to use Armstead as a blitzing linebacker, too.</p>
        <p>''I can't wait to run out there as a Giant in Giants Stadium,'' Barrow said today, though he acknowledged he may not be greeted with cheers since Friday is a Jets home game. ''I'm like a kid again, I'm just so excited.''</p>
        <p>Barrow, who signed a six-year contract worth $24 million in March, was not promising any game-breaking plays or an immediate impact for the Giants.</p>
        <p>''I just want to get in there and keep learning the defense, which is complex,'' Barrow said. ''I learned my lesson in Carolina not to put too much pressure on myself.''</p>
        <p>Barrow, who came into the National Football League with the Houston Oilers, was a major free-agent signing by Carolina after the 1996 season. Barrow started every game during three seasons in Carolina and led the team in tackles each season.</p>
        <p>But the Panthers slumped and Barrow was released to make room for other high-priced free-agent signings this winter.</p>
        <p>''I want a lot of good things to happen for me and the Giants while I'm here but I'm not concentrating on that,'' Barrow said. ''I've got a role and I'm still learning it. I just want to go out there and play like a little kid in a high school game. I'm just glad I can start playing instead of watching.''</p>
        <p>The Giants' first-team defense should play a majority of Friday's game, the only time in the preseason they will be on the field for nearly three quarters. The only likely starter missing against the Jets will be free safety Shaun Williams, who has a toe sprain. His toe is improving, though, and he may resume practicing next week.</p>
        <p>Bennett Won't Play</p>
        <p>Running back Sean Bennett won't play in Friday's game and could be inhibited for the next few weeks, or more, by an injury to the medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Bennett, a secret weapon of sorts as a pass-catching threat in the Giants' new-look offense, is awaiting the results of a magnetic resonance imaging examination he had Monday on the knee, which he also strained last season.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't feel as bad as it did when I hurt it last year,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel said Bennett would not practice for at least another week. ''There is some concern that there are a few extra things going on,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Bennett said he hurt the knee in the Giants' first preseason game Aug. 5 and was bothered by it during the Giants' second preseason game. Bennett, who also missed a week of practices last month because of a sore back, did not ask out of the Giants' lineup last week but finally asked to have the knee examined Monday when he felt that the swelling in it was hampering his running.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want people to think I'm injured too often or soft,'' Bennett said. ''I worked harder than ever in the off-season to make sure I didn't get hurt again.''</p>
        <p>Bennett said the Giants' trainers have suggested that maybe he worked too hard.</p>
        <p>''It might have backfired on me,'' Bennett said today. ''Because here I am hurt again. But I don't think it's going to be something that bothers me for too long.''</p>
