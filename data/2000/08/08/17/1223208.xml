        <p>Britain and Norway Rush To Aid Russian Submarine  Russian naval forces failed for a third day to dock a rescue vehicle onto the sunken submarine Kursk, and President Vladimir V. Putin ordered his military to accept Western offers of help. Britain sent a rescue submarine by air to Norway, from where it was to be sent to the rescue site. But hope was dimming for the submarine's 118 crew members.</p>

        <p>Reassessing Statehood Plan  Yasir Arafat said the Palestinian leadership was ''reassessing'' its plan to make a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state on Sept. 13. That raised the possibility that the Palestinians would not, after all, take a step that Israel has said will end all prospects for an early peace agreement.</p>

        <p>Concorde Loses Certification  British and French aviation regulators withdrew airworthiness certification from the Concorde, effectively ruling the world's only commercial supersonic airliner unfit to fly until it could be protected against the catastrophic safety flaws behind last month's fatal crash near Paris.</p>

        <p>Ticket Is Set as Lieberman Sets the Stage for Gore  The Democratic National Convention nominated Al Gore for president, and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, introduced himself to the American voter on prime-time television with a forceful appeal on behalf of his old friend and a muted attack on the Republican nominee, George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Senator Lieberman continued his efforts to win the full support of the party's liberal wing, and one of its prominent members, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, went before the New York delegation to praise the historic alliance between Jews and blacks. The moves occurred against a backdrop of grumbling by members of the party's traditional base about the centrist ticket and platform.</p>
        <p>A23</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore tinkered with his speech, which he and his aides describe as a political self-portrait: heavy on personal biography, policy detail and a vision for the future, composed in his own hand and syntax.</p>
        <p>A22</p>
        <p>Street protesters focused on accusations of corruption and brutality in the Los Angeles Police Department; one minor clash was observed.</p>

        <p>Cheney's Potential Dilemma  Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice president, retired from Halliburton with millions in stock options that he cannot cash until long after the next administration takes office, the company said. Mr. Cheney had said he would sell his stake before he took office. But he will not be allowed to sell the options, leaving him, if elected, either to abandon the stake or hold a sizable interest in Halliburton's future while serving as vice president.</p>

        <p>New Skin Cancer Is Diagnosed  Malignant melanoma, a potentially severe form of skin cancer, has been diagnosed on the left temple and arm of Senator John McCain, aides said. Mr. McCain, 63, was treated for malignant melanoma in 1993, when a mole was removed from his shoulder.</p>

        <p>Study of Stepmothers  Children raised in families with stepmothers are likely to have less health care, less education and less money spent on their food than children raised by their biological mothers, three studies by a Princeton economist have found.</p>

        <p>Officials Say Queens Clinic Operated Without Licenses  Officials closed a clinic that they said had no license -- nor licensed doctors -- but that claimed to have treated thousands of patients, mostly Chinese immigrants, with services ranging from herbal medicine to surgery. Six people were arrested. The clinic used three names, including the New York Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine.</p>

        <p>Findings on Subway Derailment  Investigators say a rusted rail that had cracked caused the No. 5 train derailment on April 12 that stranded 1,800 riders underground for more than two hours north of 59th Street. The rail problem was noticed almost a year earlier, but was never fixed, investigators say in a report.</p>

        <p>West Nile Spraying Plans  Health officials outlined plans to spray heavily populated areas of Brooklyn for the first time this year, and reported that traces of the virus had been detected in five live birds near Prospect Park and three dead ones in Manhattan and Queens.</p>

        <p>On Conflicts of Interest  The chief federal official overseeing the safety and ethics of experiments with human subjects, Dr. Greg Koski, said conflicts of interest in medical research were so troublesome that ''the system may have gotten entirely out of control'' and might have to be reorganized.</p>

        <p>Law Firms Reducing Free Aid  Many of the nation's biggest law firms -- inundated with more business than they can often handle and pressing lawyers to raise their billable hours to pay escalating salaries -- have cut back on pro bono work so sharply that they fall far below professional guidelines for representing people who cannot afford to pay.</p>

        <p>Toughening U.S. Tire Rules  Federal officials, facing growing criticism that regulators should have spotted problems with Firestone tires sooner, said they were working on tougher tire rules.</p>
