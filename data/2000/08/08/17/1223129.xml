        <p>The United States ordered a temporary ban on swine imports from Britain today, joining several European countries that acted after the discovery of swine fever in the country.</p>
        <p>The episode has evoked memories of Britain's battle with mad cow disease, and rattled Britain's livestock traders once again.</p>
        <p>''People are at their wits' end,'' said James Black, vice chairman of the National Pig Association, an industry group whose mood had just begun to recover after a two-year slump in prices.</p>
        <p>Swine fever is highly contagious but is not considered a threat to humans.</p>
        <p>The bans on British shipments of live pigs, pig semen and other products follow the discovery of swine fever on farms in the East Anglia region of southeast England. The outbreak is the first for 14 years.</p>
        <p>Swine fever is usually controlled only by the destruction of infected animals. Thousands of animals have already been slaughtered.</p>
        <p>Unlike mad cow disease -- bovine spongiform encephalopathy -- it is not thought to threaten humans. Mad cow disease has been linked in Britain to a similar ailment in humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, that has claimed around 50 victims in this country and caused huge economic losses in British agriculture.</p>
        <p>Hallie Pickhardt, a spokeswoman for the United States Agriculture Department, said the department had ''placed a hold'' on all swine imports from Britain. She said that American officials were working closely with their British counterparts to assess the extent of the problem.</p>
        <p>Last year, the United States imported just $11 million worth of British pork poducts, a tiny amount of its total pork imports.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the European Union, of which Britain is a member, banned the importation of live pigs and porcine semen from England to prevent swine fever from spreading to European herds, some of which were decimated by outbreaks of the disease in the Netherlands and Germany between 1997 and 1998. Like the United States, Spain went further and outlawed imports of pig meat.</p>
        <p>British officials are trying to persuade European officials in Brussels to limit the ban to live pigs from the East Anglia region.</p>
        <p>For many Britons, the ban has recalled the three-year duel between Britain and the European Union over exports of British beef, which was imposed in 1996 and finally lifted one year ago, except in France. The beef ban stirred deep resentments among those Britons opposed to what they saw as a meddlesome and hostile European bureaucracy in Brussels.</p>
        <p>The pig ban threatened to widen today. A big supermarket chain, ASDA, which is owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., has threatened to take Belgian pate off its shelves in response to the European action. An ASDA spokeswoman called the threat ''a symbolic gesture.''</p>
