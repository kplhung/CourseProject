        <p>SEAN J. KILLEEN, director of the most famously exclusive employee cafeteria in the world, hovered just behind the hot-entree station ''reading faces,'' as he put it. Eager faces, hungry faces, some of them bold-face faces, they belonged to the mob of impeccably groomed knowledge workers who were queuing up for the barbecued spareribs.</p>
        <p>''What I'm reading is frustration,'' said Mr. Killeen, broad of shoulder, red of hair. He came to the aid of his overtaxed counter crew, doling out ribs in disregard for the sanctity of his gray chalk-striped Italian-silk suit. ''How awful,''  Mr. Killeen, 35, said, ''for customers to see a guy in a suit standing around doing nothing here.''</p>

        <p>SEAN J. KILLEEN, director of the most famously exclusive employee cafeteria in the world, hovered just behind the hot-entree station ''reading faces,'' as he put it. Eager faces, hungry faces, some of them bold-face faces, they belonged to the mob of impeccably groomed knowledge workers who were queuing up for the barbecued spareribs.</p>
        <p>''What I'm reading is frustration,'' said Mr. Killeen, broad of shoulder, red of hair. He came to the aid of his overtaxed counter crew, doling out ribs in disregard for the sanctity of his gray chalk-striped Italian-silk suit. ''How awful,''  Mr. Killeen, 35, said, ''for customers to see a guy in a suit standing around doing nothing here.''</p>
        <p>''Here'' is the titanium-sheathed cafeteria designed by Frank Gehry. It's the cynosure of the new Conde Nast Building at 4 Times Square, the room that is closed to the public and supposedly cost either $30 million or $35 million, although such estimates ''have been vastly inflated,'' said Maurie Perl, a company spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>An incorrigible coven at Conde Nast already professes to be bored with the 260-seat cafeteria and its leading-edge cornucopia of 60 menu items. But legions there insist that life would be unthinkable without their hot new-style cafe, which opened April 5.</p>
        <p>That's where Mr. Killeen comes in. He is the boss, charge d'affaires, official greeter, maitre d'hotel, accountant, tummler and ''parish priest, hearing everyone's confessions,'' he said in his County Clare lilt.</p>
        <p>When necessary, Mr. Killeen is also porter and busboy, as he replenishes the silverware bin, lugs trays and reflexively stoops to remove the stray mesclun frond from the room's white-bleached-veneer ash floor that seems perfectly designed to spotlight every dropped calamata olive and mocha-bar wrapper.</p>
        <p>Check costs average $6 a person in the cafeteria, which is not company subsidized and ''is supposed to make a profit for my employer,'' Mr. Killeen said of Restaurant Associates, which runs it. The lunch record so far is 1,325 customers. Revenues average $9,000 a day and thus far profit is ''modest, but growing,'' Mr. Killeen said.</p>
        <p>This day the anointed were arriving early. James Truman, Conde Nast's Nottingham-born editorial director, materialized near the antipasto station at 12:15 p.m. with a luncheon guest, Joan Juliet Buck of French Vogue. Mr. Truman lunches in the cafeteria ''four times a week,'' despite the fact that Mr. Killeen ''keeps insulting my home country,'' he said with a laugh. (English, um, cuisine, hasn't graced the daily International Table offerings, while Irish fare has.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Killeen smiled back at Mr. Truman with hazel-eyed Hibernian innocence.</p>
        <p>Moments later, S. I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Conde Nast and its parent company, Advance Publications, began navigating his milky-hued oval tray in the proximity of the rosemary olive sourdough rolls. Soon he was spooning out some of the Asian slaw with bok choy red cabbage.</p>
        <p>''I keep trying something new each day,'' he said, occupying the cashier's line like any other editorial schlepper. Then he found his favorite corner window table for a tete-a-tete with Mitchell B. Fox, the senior vice president for corporate sales.</p>
        <p>Mr. Newhouse ''won't let us carry his tray or hold his seat for him,'' said Mr. Killeen, who added that building policy forbade the reservation of cafeteria tables or preferential treatment for the Nastocracy.</p>
        <p>Owning the place does confer some privilege, though. No garlic -- none -- is used in the cafeteria kitchen because Mr. Newhouse cannot abide it. (Vampires, take note.)</p>
        <p>The apparition of corporate deities among the plebes has helped democratize the Conde Nast zeitgeist, some say. Consider, for example, a recent watershed moment in the evolution of the New Culture. Several titanium dwellers witnessed the fun when an unidentified subordinate asked several lunching junior editors to vacate a coveted window table ''because Ms. Wintour is coming down and needs a booth.'' That would be Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue. The little people, who were having dessert, flat-out refused. They say they are still drawing paychecks.</p>
        <p>''Our staff would never do that kind of thing,'' Mr. Killeen said of the attempted displacement, ''and we would never say that so-and-so wants the table.''</p>
        <p>If it is officially known as a cafeteria, around the building the space has been ironically designated The Commissary and The Aquarium. Some politically incorrect males call it the Cafeteria o' Babes, and Conde Nast employee fashion is so forward that the steep walkway that climbs the cafeteria's central hillock has been dubbed ''the catwalk.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Killeen's day starts in the splendid isolation of his cramped office at 6 a.m. as he prepares his staff of 53 for breakfast (7 a.m. to 11 a.m.); he leaves the cafeteria 13 hours later. One of seven siblings raised on a farm near Kilkee in the west of Ireland, Mr. Killeen was from an early age inspired to the hospitality trade by his ''family's talent for the entertainment of guests.''</p>
        <p>After collecting a Dublin bachelor's degree in restaurant management, he paid his food-service dues in London, Australia and Chicago before joining Restaurant Associates in 1994.</p>
        <p>In his management career he has truly seen it all. So what would really make his day? ''That's easy,'' he said, while freeing a rambunctious tray that had impeded the megadollar solid-state dirty-dish conveyor belt. ''I'm hoping that someday G.Q. might use me for a makeover.''</p>
