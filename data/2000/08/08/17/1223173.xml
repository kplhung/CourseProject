        <p>The hallways were empty. Most of the courtrooms were empty. Most of the restrooms were empty, too. In fact, one of the only things filling up Federal District Court in Brooklyn these days is idle summertime talk.</p>
        <p>''Yep, it's pretty slow,'' said William Keane, a court security officer entrusted with protecting the courthouse's vacant lobby in the midafternoon hush. Officer Keane was sitting at a wooden desk on Monday, giving his feet a rest. He had pulled cell phone confiscation duty, not that there were many phones to confiscate. (Ringing cell phones disturb court proceedings.)</p>
        <p>''On days like this, you just hang out,'' Officer Keane said with a sigh, adding that he wished he had a tabloid to read. ''It's boring. Sometimes there's six or seven of us sitting around down here just waiting.''</p>
        <p>Typically, the federal courts hum with legal action as criminal cases are prosecuted and civil matters are argued in such quantity that even the most senior judges are forced to share courtrooms. But in the dog days of August, the wheels of the law often slow to a gentle spin.</p>
        <p>On Monday, for example, 13 of the 20 judges assigned to the federal courthouse in Brooklyn Heights,  overlooking Cadman Plaza Park, were out. Judge Edward R. Korman had no cases scheduled until Sept. 8. Judge Jack B. Weinstein had nothing doing until Sept. 1. Over and over, the mostly blank court docket told the tale: most of the federal judges in Brooklyn had made like a deadlocked jury and split.</p>
        <p>Judge Allyne R. Ross -- who was unlucky enough to have been one of the few judges working on Monday -- said that although many of her colleagues had little on their schedules this week, it was not uncommon to see them in their chambers, writing opinions, boning up on future cases or otherwise working like dogs. She did not seem perturbed by having six proceedings on her daily calendar. ''I'm not away,'' she said. ''I'm just here doing my thing.''</p>
        <p>That thing included handing down five sentences and presiding over an arraignment -- a fairly important workload considering the number of minor status conferences and news-free initial hearings that were occurring on Monday. There was only one trial going on, and that had reached only the jury selection stage.</p>
        <p>According to the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn, only seven federal trials were scheduled in Brooklyn for all of August. In comparison, 21 are set to open in September. ''We're on trial when the cases are scheduled,'' said William J. Muller, a spokesman for the office. ''It can be busy or it can be slow. But there's nothing built into the system that would dictate slowing down.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the summer doldrums were so widespread that even at the courthouse's second-floor concession stand, Maryann Gilliard, a cashier, reported that candy bar and newspaper sales were down. She added, however, that breath mints and bottled water were still selling well. ''All the lawyers, you know,'' she said, ''they still have to talk.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the busiest group at the courthouse was the gang of construction workers digging the foundation of what will eventually be a new court building at a site next door.</p>
        <p>''You know, I got to apply to be a federal judge when the job's done here,'' said James Ahearn, who was driving a mud-caked front loader. ''Doing nothing much in August sounds pretty damn good.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, back in the lobby, nothing much was going on. No lawyers emptied their pockets at the metal detector. No law clerks scooted by with coffee and snacks. No defendants. No judges. No spectators. Zilch.</p>
        <p>''Hey, Vinnie, kommen sie her,'' Officer Keane called out to his partner, Vincent Morris, who was posted at the X-ray machine. ''You got any good antidotes about how slow it is today?''</p>
        <p>''Today?'' mused Officer Morris. ''No, nothing today. It's kind of slow.''</p>
        <p>Their laughter echoed off the empty marble floors.</p>
