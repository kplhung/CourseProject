        <p>Al Gore has two big problems  Bill Clinton and Al Gore.</p>
        <p>He may be able to finesse one of them -- Mr. Clinton. But the other he will have to face head-on.</p>
        <p>''People still don't feel they really know Al Gore, and that's hurting him,'' said a Democratic delegate, her face a study in disappointment. ''They think they know Clinton but Gore comes off as inauthentic. Only he can change that.''</p>
        <p>If you look at the state of the nation, nearly everything is going the vice president's way. The U.S. is enjoying the best economy in its history. The country is at peace. Crime and unemployment are way down, as are the welfare rolls and rates of teen pregnancy. The stock market has soared and so has home ownership.</p>
        <p>Never before has the American dream been the reality for so many.</p>
        <p>Moreover, most voters appear to agree with Mr. Gore on most of the big issues in this year's election, largely supporting his approach on such matters as health care, Social Security, taxes and the way to handle the federal budget surplus.</p>
        <p>Polls have shown that a majority of voters also believe Mr. Gore is better prepared to be president than George W. Bush in terms of his intellectual capacity, command of the issues and experience.</p>
        <p>And yet the vice president has trailed Mr. Bush in poll after poll, sometimes by wide margins. And the lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Gore from groups that traditionally are among the Democrats' strongest supporters, notably blacks and labor unions, is both palpable and potentially devastating.</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton is a problem because the Gore folks both need him and wish he would go away. The vice president would like to bask in the sunshine of Mr. Clinton's accomplishments, even as he worries about getting lost in the president's shadow. He also worries about the dangers of Clinton fatigue.</p>
        <p>But the bigger, tougher problem is Al Gore himself. Interviews this week with staunch Democrats who are fervent in their desire to see him become president have shown a deep concern that Mr. Gore's strengths when it comes to issues and experience may be trumped by the widespread perception that Mr. Bush is more likable.</p>
        <p>The feeling generally was that Mr. Gore's public persona and communications skills had not markedly improved over the course of the campaign. There was a hunger among most of the people I talked with for the vice president to become less guarded and more spontaneous in his public appearances.</p>
        <p>Robert Kayyem, a Los Angeles venture capitalist, was one of about 1,400 people who attended a Clinton fund-raiser over the weekend. When Mr. Clinton spoke, he said, ''the other 1,399 people disappeared and it was as if the president had put his hands on my shoulders and was talking directly to me. Too often, Gore is just giving you boilerplate. He needs to speak with a certain genuineness of tone, which has been lacking. And I think he has to take some risks with his viewpoints and opinions.''</p>
        <p>Loren Rothschild, the owner of an investment fund and a supporter of Mr. Gore, agreed that the vice president's personality was problematic. But he remained optimistic. ''Not everyone can be Bill Clinton or Franklin Roosevelt or John Kennedy,'' he said. ''But it seems to me the Democrats have the issues -- on choice, on gun control, on the economy. And I think when people look at those issues they'll vote for the Democrats.''</p>
        <p>Tonight's the night for Mr. Gore. With much of the nation watching -- both critically and expectantly -- he will give his acceptance speech. It may not be fair to compare him to Mr. Clinton, who was blessed with extraordinary political skills, or to suggest that it is not enough for Mr. Gore to be better prepared and better qualified than Mr. Bush. It was a Democrat, after all, John Kennedy, who liked to point out that life is not fair.</p>
        <p>Leadership is as important as competence in a president. The American people must be convinced that Al Gore is capable of defining a vision for the country and then rallying the forces necessary to realize that vision. And after Bill Clinton, they especially need a president they know is being straight with them.</p>
        <p>Al Gore should let it rip tonight. The real Al Gore. Because if a phony shows up at that podium, this election is over.</p>
