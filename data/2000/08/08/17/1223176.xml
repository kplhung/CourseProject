        <p>Childhood memories are quirky, sometimes not so much in what they leave in as what they leave out.

        <p>I don't remember a single pitch thrown by Whitey Ford, a 21-year-old left-handed Yankee rookie, as he went into the ninth inning that day having held the National League champs, the Phillies, scoreless.

        <p>Childhood memories are quirky, sometimes not so much in what they leave in as what they leave out. I remember watching the fourth game of the 1950 World Series on television -- it was an October afternoon, a time on the calendar when kids across the country suddenly developed mysterious illnesses and had to stay home from school, and no one had even dreamed of playing a World Series game at night.</p>
        <p>I don't remember a single pitch thrown by Whitey Ford, a 21-year-old left-handed Yankee rookie, as he went into the ninth inning that day having held the National League champs, the Phillies, scoreless. What I remember was Casey Stengel, the old, bowlegged Yankee manager, leaving the mound with Ford after having taken him out of the game and actually apologizing to the sellout crowd in Yankee Stadium for doing it.</p>
        <p>Vivid in my memory is Stengel's shrug, palms up at his sides, gesturing in response to the mixture of cheers for Ford and boos for his removal. It was a display of sympathy for the kid from Astoria, Queens, who just a few years earlier was playing in street stickball games, and now under a national spotlight and World Series pressure had pitched so beautifully. The fans believed the young man deserved to finish the game.</p>
        <p>Ford had the Phillies shut out by 5-0 when, with two out and two on, Gene Woodling muffed a fly ball in left field. Two runs scored. Mike Goliat followed with a single through the left side of the infield. And that is when Stengel came out of the dugout and motioned for a relief pitcher.</p>
        <p>Allie Reynolds retired the last batter and Ford got his victory. Ford would go on to win nine more games in World Series play, a record, as well as break a Babe Ruth pitching mark with 33 consecutive scoreless innings in World Series games. In 16 major league seasons, all with the Yankees, Ford won 236 games and lost 106, for the best winning percentage (.690) of any pitcher in the 20th century, and in 1974 he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>And on Sunday, in Yankee Stadium, the Yankees will hold Whitey Ford Day, for 50 years of continuous service to the Yankees as a player, a coach, a broadcaster, a consultant, and, finally, as Chairman of the Board, the nickname he earned for being someone who was regularly called upon in the clutch, and invariably came through.</p>
        <p>''The Yankees called and asked if I'd be open to a day for me,'' Ford said yesterday by phone from his home in Lake Success on Long Island. ''Twenty minutes later I called back: 'That'll be fine.' ''</p>
        <p>He also said that he's feeling fine -- ''a lot better than I was a few months ago'' -- and that he was finished with the radiation treatments he had been undergoing after removal of a cancerous brain tumor from the left side of his head in November. Five years ago, he went through a similar procedure after a cancerous tumor had been discovered on the right side of his brain.</p>
        <p>Of course, when a day for you is approaching, it is a time for reminiscence. He remembers being in awe of Joe DiMaggio -- ''my hero since I was 8 years old and just starting to follow baseball'' -- and seeing him and Lou Gehrig in 1938 from a bleacher seat. Ford recalled meeting a very shy Yogi Berra on the day in 1947 when Berra came up for the first time to the Yankees, from Newark, and Ford was in the dugout after having just signed his first contract with the Yankees, at age 17.</p>
        <p>And he laughed about his days as bon vivant on the road with Billy Martin and Mickey Mantle, and being ''preached'' to by Stengel about the dangers of ruining their careers by staying out late. (At one point in the 1962 World Series against the Giants, Stengel told them: ''If you're trying to outdrink San Francisco, you're overmatched.'')</p>
        <p>One has to believe that whatever Ford was doing, he wasn't doing it -- or no longer was doing it -- to harmful excess. When he retired, partway in the 1967 season, it was because of problems with his pitching elbow.</p>
        <p>While there were always rumors that he may have scuffed or moistened a ball or two or more in his time, success for the 5-foot-10-inch, 180-pound Ford was due to great control, superb breaking balls and an uncanny wit on the mound.</p>
        <p>''You would be amazed,'' he once said, ''how many important outs you can get by working the count down to where the hitter is sure you're going to throw to his weakness and then throw to his power instead.''</p>
        <p>What would he like to be remembered for? ''For being nice, having a good family life, and I think I was liked by other players,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And his greatest baseball memory? ''Not one single moment stands out,'' he said. But literally a series of moments: pitching in 11 World Series in his first 13 seasons in the big leagues.</p>
        <p>For some of the rest of us, his first World Series, 50 years ago this year, and that poignant moment when he was sent to the showers, remains most compelling.</p>
