        <p>British Telecommunications P.L.C. is expected to announce Thursday that it will take control of Viag Interkom, a German telephone company, by doubling its ownership stake to 90 percent in a deal worth about 6 billion euros ($5.46 billion), according to executives close to the deal.</p>
        <p>The move shows British Telecom's increasing desire to take controlling  interests in its investments rather than minority positions. British Telecom currently holds a 45 percent interest in Viag Interkom.</p>
        <p>According to the executives, British Telecom, Britain's biggest telephone company, agreed in principle today to the buyout of Viag Interkom's other major shareholder, E.On A.G., a German energy concern, which also holds a 45 percent stake in the German telephone company.</p>
        <p>Telenor A.S., a Norwegian telephone company, owns the remaining 10 percent of Viag Interkom.</p>
        <p>While many formerly state-owned European telephone operators like Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom have been on an aggressive path recently by making prominent acquisitions -- Deutsche Telekom has a deal to acquire VoiceStream Wireless of the United States for $50 billion and France Telecom bought Orange P.L.C. of Britain for $37.5 billion -- British Telecom has clearly remained in the background, plotting its next move with what some would call English reserve.</p>
        <p>Though British Telecom's buyout of Viag Interkom is somewhat prosaic by the standards set by its acquisitive European rivals, the deal is an important step in the British telephone operator's quest to create a pan-European footprint and gain a foothold in Germany, one of the biggest markets for telecommunications, particularly for wireless services.</p>
        <p>Viag Interkom is the third-largest telephone operator in Germany, controlling a fixed-line network as well as a wireless network. Viag Interkom's real attraction is its wireless network, with more than two million subscribers. While the wireless unit, called E2, is small in comparison with its competitors -- it ranks as the fourth largest -- it is one of the last available avenues into the mobile telephone market in Germany.</p>
        <p>Viag Interkom is currently in the midst of Germany's high-stakes auction to win a third-generation mobile telephone license that will allow it to offer fast wireless data services. Like the auction in Britain, which cost telephone operators here $35.5 billion in total, Germany's auction is also testing the wills and pocketbooks of the bidders by reaching even loftier bidding heights.</p>
        <p>Today the bid totals in Germany reached 47.7 billion euros, or about $43.4 billion. The bids are seen as a bellwether for similar auctions to be conducted in the future in both Europe and the United States.</p>
        <p>Viag Interkom's most recent bid is for about 7.9 billion marks, or about $3.7 billion at current exchange rates. It is crucial for British Telecom that Viag Interkom secure a license so that it will be able to offer seamless third-generation services across all of the networks it owns to compete with the likes of Vodafone AirTouch P.L.C., the world's largest mobile telephone company.</p>
        <p>Viag Interkom's chairman, Maximilian Ardelt, said recently he was certain that the company would win a license in the German auctions, which are expected to end shortly.</p>
        <p>For E.On, which was created by the merger of the German utility  companies Veba and Viag, the deal fits its strategy of selling assets that  are beyond its core business, allowing it to focus more closely on its traditional strength, power generation and energy.</p>
