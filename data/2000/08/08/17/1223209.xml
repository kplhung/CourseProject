        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The success of the KIPP Academy schools (''Seeking to Clone Schools of Success for Poor,'' front page, Aug. 16) could be repeated in most places if the principles of these schools were widely put into practice.</p>
        <p>Achievement depends on a dynamic process within the ''secular trinity'': school, student and parent contracting to try to accomplish specific things within certain periods of time, depending upon grade level and subject. Constant work toward an acknowledged goal is crucial.</p>

        <p>The success of the KIPP Academy schools (''Seeking to Clone Schools of Success for Poor,'' front page, Aug. 16) could be repeated in most places if the principles of these schools were widely put into practice.</p>
        <p>Achievement depends on a dynamic process within the ''secular trinity'': school, student and parent contracting to try to accomplish specific things within certain periods of time, depending upon grade level and subject. Constant work toward an acknowledged goal is crucial.</p>
        <p>If one part is absent -- the parent, for example -- or if the explicit agreement is missing, public schools, especially inner-city schools, will continue to be what they have been for at least two generations: warehouses whose inventory wanders in and 12 years later is shipped out with a bill of lading known more commonly as a diploma.</p>
