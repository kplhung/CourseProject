        <p>THE tiny island of Barbados has not a single yard of railroad track, exactly one airport and only one regular television channel. Put 11 Bajans on a field with 11 Americans, however, and who knows what could happen?</p>
        <p>This was the operative theory early last evening, as this small nation represented gigantic fear and trembling to the United States, or at least to that small segment of Americans aware of the threat.</p>
        <p>This is the menacing charm of soccer, because one stinker of a game, one wayward ball, one flub, one grotesque penalty call, can upset millions of dollars' worth of preparation.</p>
        <p>''The little minnow gets a chance to beat the big guy,'' said Bruce Arena, the coach of the American national team, who was dependent on beating Barbados last night to have realistic chance of qualifying for the 2002 World Cup finals.</p>
        <p>The minnows did not fluster the Yanks, and there were fewer of them as the game progressed. Two Bajans were tossed out in the first half for gratuitous fouls, and the Americans went on to overpower them, 7-0, which is precisely what logic would dictate against a nation of a quarter of a million residents.</p>
        <p>The Americans, however, never have a reason to be relaxed in World Cup soccer. The bigger soccer nations generally thump them, and the smaller soccer nations scare them, at least.</p>
        <p>The land of the Whoppers, the land of Clinton, the land of Jordan, the land of various Simpsons, the land of Madonna, had every chance of being embarrassed by an island two and a half times larger than Washington.</p>
        <p>This is not some kind of Dream Team game, in which Charles Barkley could come out and mock Angolans. This is a sport in which the Americans do not dominate, a healthy anomaly given the way the United States distributes its burgers and its sneakers and its icons all over the world.</p>
        <p>The Yanks were humbled by Germany, by Iran, by Yugoslavia, during the 1998 World Cup, and each of those losses was perfectly understandable.</p>
        <p>The World Cup qualifying rounds produce the true terror. The United States must meet all these modest countries from Central America and the Caribbean, with their aspirations, their resentments, their youth kicking tattered soccer balls or perhaps even stuffed socks, while American youth are playing with their computers and watching Derek Jeter and Keyshawn Johnson get their exercise for them.</p>
        <p>Every four years, it comes around. The United States had to go down and suffer a draw with Guatemala in a small town chosen for its isolation, which it did in early July.</p>
        <p>Later in the month, in Costa Rica, in a stadium jammed with people who get only a few chances in life to root against Goliath, the United States lost when a Jamaican referee made an imaginative hand-ball call on an American defender whose hands were placed, textbook-style, at his sides.</p>
        <p>Last night Coach Horace Beckles of Barbados complained about the ''atrocious'' officiating the same way Arena had in Costa Rica. The rule in soccer in soccer is, get your draws on the road and your victories at home -- particularly against the little nations. There was not great national pressure last night. The majority of Americans are enjoying the pennant races, keeping an eye on football training camps, vaguely aware that the Summer Games are coming up next month.</p>
        <p>This is not Italy, where if the national team had 1 point on the road and about to play Liechtenstein, all of Italy would come grinding to a stop like one of those four-hour strikes they love to pull.</p>
        <p>Soccer nations quiver in a spot like this. Italy lost the final of the European Championship last month, and its coach, the national hero, Dino Zoff, resigned after his strategy was publicly criticized.</p>
        <p>While Arena does not have a nation on his back, he did have a few impetuous types at the United States Soccer Federation watching how the Yanks performed last night.</p>
        <p>''Sure, I feel the pressure,'' Arena said. ''I probably put pressure on myself, but this is how I earn my living. I don't take it lightly. We haven't started well.''</p>
        <p>Barbados had stunned Costa Rica at home, using only one prominent professional, Gregory Goodridge, 28, who plays for Bristol City in England's Second Division.</p>
        <p>Never having budgeted for this second round of qualifying games, the Barbadian federation is going more broke with every game. Its team was ranked 102nd in the world while the United States was ranked 19th, but there was always the chance of a ball skittering any which way, producing chaos. Last night Goliath shrugged off the minnows. It is not usually that easy.</p>
        <p>''That is the nature of the game,'' said Arena, who is quite intelligent enough to see the sick humor of the process, which the rest of the world enjoys.</p>
