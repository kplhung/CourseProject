        <p>Any one of the 500 million people who live in Latin America can sign on to the Internet, given access to a computer and a phone line. They can buy a book, CD or anything else offered for sale on the Internet, given a credit card. And they can have their purchase delivered to their home or office, given luck.</p>
        <p>In many parts of Latin America, postal service outside of major business centers is erratic at best. At times, the only reliable national delivery system belongs to the soft drink and potato chip manufacturers that stock the bodegas and mom-and-pop stores that do business in almost every community, no matter how small or remote.</p>
        <p>Even in the cities, packages from abroad can be delayed in customs for days, and letters arrive weeks late, if at all.</p>
        <p>That, to a large extent, leaves the final leg of electronic commerce in Latin America the province of private services. Each big city has a few local fast-freight companies, and recently specialized e-commerce companies like Sky Box Services allow Latin Americans to have Internet purchases sent to an address in the United States. Sky Box then carries them south and delivers them to homes and offices, bypassing often unreliable local carriers.</p>
        <p>The most visible deliverers are the large international companies like United Parcel Service, FedEx and DHL, and all are expected to play a part in the growth of e-commerce in Latin America. They have been preparing to handle the new business, although they do not expect it to boom anytime soon.</p>
        <p>''We liken the status of the Internet in Latin America to being where the United States was in 1996,'' said John Menna, vice president at U.P.S. for marketing for Latin America and the Caribbean. ''It'll take about four or five years to start seeing anything substantial develop there. Nonetheless, U.P.S. is putting in place all the pieces and the infrastructure to facilitate electronic commerce and the buying and selling of goods throughout Latin America.''</p>
        <p>According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the number of computers connected to the Internet last year rose more rapidly in Latin America than in any other part of the world. Even so, while the region accounts for 8 percent of the world's population, it represents just 3.5 percent of Internet users and less than 1 percent of global e-commerce.</p>
        <p>Many obstacles hamper development of the Internet in Latin America. Poverty is so persistent that many people still lack access to a telephone, and the possibility of buying a computer, let alone logging onto the Internet, is reserved for a relatively small group of city dwellers with sufficient incomes. Few people have credit cards, which still are essential for e-commerce to work. Computer literacy lags far behind levels in other parts of the world, and telephone service competition has not yet brought down the cost of Internet access.</p>
        <p>And then there is the issue of delivery. ''Local delivery of goods is something that many people in Latin America associate with the local postal service, which in the past has been a very poor service indeed,'' Mr. Menna said.</p>
        <p>To strengthen its Latin American operations, U.P.S. is buying Challenge Air Cargo, an airline that serves Latin America from Miami. Besides increasing the U.P.S. fleet, the acquisition provides landing rights in virtually every developed country in Latin America, a process that could have taken years had it been negotiated nation by nation.</p>
        <p>The Challenge purchase ''clearly says that we think Latin America is a growing region,'' Mr. Menna said. But e-commerce, he added, ''is still all potential.''</p>
        <p>Competition is intense among the air delivery services. DHL Worldwide Express has spent $30 million  the last two years preparing for more cargo, including substantially more e-commerce deliveries. In 1998, the company bought three Boeing 727's, upgraded its hub in Panama City and built a new hub in Buenos Aires. Last year DHL also acquired DHL S.A., a contract operation in Argentina that was run by a local company. DHL is spending up to $10 million to improve service in Argentina.</p>
        <p>''Latin America has an awful lot of people, an awful lot of land and huge potential,'' said Colum Joyce, an electronic commerce manager at DHL's headquarters in Brussels. ''But it's no different from anywhere else in the world. There are a few relatively concentrated points of consumption, and pickup on the Internet is concentrating on those socioeconomic segments of the community.''</p>
        <p>The other big air delivery service in the region, FedEx, is building a larger cargo handling operation at Miami International Airport, the gateway through which most shipments to Latin America pass. But its real focus is on streamlining the process for getting goods in and out of Latin America.</p>
        <p>Juan N. Cento, president of FedEx Express International's Latin America division, said his company was  helping customers, like the hammock manufacturer in Merida, Mexico, he visited recently, design and build their Web pages to take full advantage of the global market available on the Internet.</p>
        <p>''They say, 'Here's what we need,' and we help them with everything from building a Web page to monitoring the shipping, tracking and tracing of packages,'' Mr. Cento said.</p>
        <p>FedEx is also working to reduce customs delays for packages coming into Latin America. It recently opened a new clearing house at the Toluca Airport outside Mexico City that enables local customs agents to clear shipments worth less than $200 on the day they arrive. A similar system is planned for Campinas, Brazil, near Sao Paolo, and will later be replicated throughout the region.</p>
        <p>''E-commerce is an increasingly integral part of the business environment in certain markets in the region,'' said Gregory M. Rossiter, a FedEx spokesman. ''But quite candidly, for FedEx, the potential for e-commerce in the region as a whole is still a number of years away.''</p>
