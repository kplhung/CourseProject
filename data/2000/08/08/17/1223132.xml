        <p>In the workaday harbor here, normally plied by tugs, tankers and freighters laid up for repairs, Le Levant offered a startling contrast on a recent day: a sleek French cruise ship disgorging 50 affluent American tourists.</p>
        <p>To welcome the first visitors of Newfoundland's late-summer cruise season, two young women in redcoat colonial uniforms played flutes on the quay, and Sailor, a huge Newfoundland dog, wagged his tail enthusiastically.</p>
        <p>Here on Canada's easternmost island, the scheduled arrival of 15 tourist ships this season is part of a larger psychological and economic turnaround for a province often compared to Ireland, the ancestral home of many of its 540,000 residents.</p>
        <p>For years, Newfoundland has been Canada's poorest province, a steady exporter of brain and brawn and a heavy importer of financial aid from Ottawa. But echoing Ireland's recent experience, Newfoundland recorded Canada's highest growth rate last year, 5.3 percent.</p>
        <p>Oil revenues are eating away at Newfoundland's need for federal aid; a thriving crab and lobster fishing industry is replacing the 500-year experience with cod; and Newfoundland, with its coves and quiet, is becoming a magnet for tourists. After stagnating for a decade, tourism jumped by 50 percent over the last four years.</p>
        <p>The 1990's were the boom years for cruise ships in the Pacific waters of British Columbia and Alaska. In the new decade, Americans are discovering cruising Atlantic Canada, from Nova Scotia to Newfoundland to Labrador, and north into the eastern Arctic.</p>
        <p>This summer, 150,000 people, almost all Americans, are expected to take cruises into Canada's eastern provinces, a sevenfold increase since 1995. Halifax, Nova Scotia, the region's most popular port of call, has reservations this season for 102 ships, double the number in 1998. In Montreal, the number of passengers disembarking at docks of the Old Port neighborhood is expected to hit 38,000 this summer, double last year's level. Most of the Atlantic Canada cruises start in Boston and New York.</p>
        <p>On Canada's Pacific coast, British Columbia expects three times as many cruise passengers as in Atlantic Canada. But if present trends continue, by the end of this decade cruise traffic on the two coasts will be roughly even, with one million cruise ship passengers each summer turning Canadian waters into the Caribbean of the north.</p>
        <p>Worldwide, to capture future waves of retiring baby boomers, cruise ship companies anticipate growth and have ordered 60 new ships, worth $24 billion.</p>
        <p>''This means the cruise industry is going to be looking for new destinations,'' said Gordon Slade, chief executive of the Cruiseship Authority of Newfoundland and Labrador, a new public-private entity here.</p>
        <p>''Our niche is really the adventure cruising,'' he said. ''We offer what Alaska offers -- whales, seabirds and fjords. But we also have what Alaska doesn't have -- the moving ice, icebergs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Slade was down at the quay here to greet the French ship, which had steamed from St. Pierre and Miquelon, two French islands off the southwest coast of Newfoundland.</p>
        <p>Jan E. Robinson, a 45-year-old federal worker from Los Angeles, greeted Sailor, the dog, and set off for sightseeing on Water Street, which the city claims to be the oldest street in North America. On her return, she pronounced St. John's, which dates to the mid-1500's, ''a beautiful city -- if I could figure out how to come back, I would do it.''</p>
        <p>Robert W. Burgess, a 68-year-old retired manufacturer from Massachusetts who was traveling with his wife, Nancy, was blunt about why they were here. After 12 cruises, he said, ''we're running out of places to go.''</p>
        <p>Last year, 1.1 million American tourists visited Atlantic Canada, a record number that undoubtedly was lifted higher by the lure of the weak Canadian dollar.</p>
        <p>''The Americans are pretty free with their money,'' said Ernest Gosse, a taxi driver who makes a point of circling by Harbour Avenue when a cruise ship is in port. ''Last summer, I had one lady who bought a little dory boat, a couple of sweaters for her grandkids and two replicas of Viking ships.''</p>
        <p>Spurring North American interest in the Rock, as Newfoundlanders affectionately call their island, are a number of recent novels, most notably ''The Shipping News'' (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster), a novel by E. Annie Proulx that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994.</p>
        <p>''Newfoundland is not well known -- this puts us out there,'' Mr. Slade, the cruise ship promoter, said of the book. ''More people read it outside the province than inside the province. First person I talked to who had read the book was from Texas.''</p>
        <p>For the cruise industry really to take off, St. John's, a metropolitan area of 150,000 people, needs a way for people to fly from Europe and the United States and then to take the cruise ships one way.</p>
        <p>Canadians have been demanding an end to laws that restrict flights between Canadian cities to Canadian airlines. An end to such restrictions would clear the way for international flights to stop here.</p>
        <p>''Canada should consider real airline competition,'' Brian Tobin, premier of Newfoundland and Labrador,  said in an interview. ''We are not prepared to be quaint little Newfoundland, shrouded in the mists of time, so Air Canada can be a monopoly for the next 50 years.''</p>
