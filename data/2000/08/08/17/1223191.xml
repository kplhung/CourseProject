        <p>Tuesday evening might have looked like Kennedy Central at the Democratic convention, but the family member who is the biggest star inside the party these days was not on the podium during prime time.</p>
        <p>Patrick J. Kennedy, the 33-year-old second-term congressman from  Rhode Island, has achieved his stardom in the behind-the-scenes world of money and politics, collecting millions of dollars for his House colleagues and Democratic congressional candidates. In his role as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Mr. Kennedy has impressed his older and more seasoned colleagues, including Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader from Missouri, who is also a committee leader.</p>
        <p>''He's the brightest and hardest working young fund-raiser to hit the Democratic Party since Tony Coelho,'' said Mark Weiner, the treasurer of the Democratic Governors' Association and a big-league Democratic money man himself.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Kennedy's stewardship, the D Triple-C, as the committee is called in political shorthand, has collected $62 million since January 1999, Erik Smith, the committee spokesman said. With the fierce struggle for control of the House in the November election, this record haul is a potent weapon for Democrats. House Democrats actually have more cash on hand than their Republican counterparts, a historic reversal.</p>
        <p>His grateful colleagues from the House and hopeful Congressional candidates tonight celebrated Mr. Kennedy's transformation into a Democratic money machine at a party for 1,500 people at the Egyptian Theater, a lavishly restored movie palace on Hollywood Boulevard, which first opened its doors in 1922 with Douglas Fairbanks in ''Robin Hood.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy is, in a way, a Robin Hood of sorts for the Democrats. At Mr. Kennedy's urging, individual donors are giving more money to the D Triple-C than ever before. Since his appointment in December of 1998, he has been the first leader of the committee to create tiered giving, starting elite groups for Democratic donors of $50,000 and $100,000. Mr. Kennedy has been on the road almost constantly, raising money for Democratic Houses races, including trips to San Diego, Seattle and Atlanta. He even persuaded Tony Bennett, whose  private performances can cost as much as $250,000, to donate a concert in Newport, R.I., next weekend.</p>
        <p>That is proof, committee staff members say, that Mr. Kennedy has a lot of celebrity mojo at work. ''Patrick can call up a C.E.O. and ask for money,'' a staff member said. ''The name helps. Patrick gets his calls returned.''</p>
        <p>Such bluntness is not out of character for Mr. Kennedy, who is a bold speaker, given to occasional outbursts complete with foot-stamping and a high-pitched strain to his voice that makes him sound more like a croaky teenager and less of a congressional heavy.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, he spoke passionately in a series of breakfast meetings to delegations: about the important symbolism of one uncle's nomination here 40 years ago and another uncle's assassination here 32 years ago, as well as the spinal tumor that threatened his life years ago. As a politician, Mr. Kennedy is energetic and displays the hallmark Kennedy charisma. As he approached the  meeting of American Indians, several older women rushed out to hug him, tears forming in their eyes. It seems that everyone at the convention calls him by his first name.</p>
        <p>There are, of course, those who would accuse Mr. Kennedy of selling out. There are some glaring ironies at work in Mr. Kennedy's fund-raising: Two-thirds of the money the D Triple-C has raised came in the form of large, unlimited contributions known as soft money, the type of donation used for party building that Democrats are trying to eliminate.  And Mr. Kennedy's father, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, helped draft the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1976, which was intended in part to limit soft-money donations.</p>
        <p>Darrell West, a professor of political science at Brown University, who has written a biography of Mr. Kennedy, said that Mr. Kennedy was  openly flouting the rules his father wrote in 1976 to rebuild his party's finances. ''It is deeply ironic the way Kennedy is using soft money,'' Mr. West said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy's spokesman, Larry Berman, said: ''Well, the Republicans made the rules. And Patrick just wants to play on a level playing field.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy is reputed to have a bit of a temper; in March, for example, he physically confronted a 58-year-old female security guard at Los Angeles International Airport. The Los Angeles city attorney's office considered filing misdemeanor battery charges but declined. Mr. Kennedy acknowledged that he had acted rudely and apologized.</p>
        <p>So much fund-raising leaves him little personal time, he said. So he is not married. ''Marriage gives you the image of stability, gravity and maturity,'' he said as he rushed out of the Omni to more receptions and interviews. He paused for a moment,  then added: ''You know, all of those important things that are missing from my life.''</p>
