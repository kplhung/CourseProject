        <p>Prayer and party were never far apart when Buju Banton performed on Sunday night at the Hammerstein Ballroom. He sang a Jamaican version of the Lord's Prayer, and he preached the long-running message of conscious reggae: determination in the face of oppression, backed by Rastafarian faith. He also touted his sexual prowess, calling himself a ''love sponge'' and a ''champion,'' bounding across the stage while women in the audience laughed and squealed with delight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Banton had his first reggae hit in 1991, when he was 18, and has spent the last decade growing up in public. He started as a dancehall toaster, rapping about girls in a saw-toothed growl. But he soon turned to more socially conscious messages, calling for an end to gun violence in ''Murderer,'' promoting condom use in ''Willy (Don't Be Silly),'' citing biblical language and invoking Jah.</p>

        <p>Prayer and party were never far apart when Buju Banton performed on Sunday night at the Hammerstein Ballroom. He sang a Jamaican version of the Lord's Prayer, and he preached the long-running message of conscious reggae: determination in the face of oppression, backed by Rastafarian faith. He also touted his sexual prowess, calling himself a ''love sponge'' and a ''champion,'' bounding across the stage while women in the audience laughed and squealed with delight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Banton had his first reggae hit in 1991, when he was 18, and has spent the last decade growing up in public. He started as a dancehall toaster, rapping about girls in a saw-toothed growl. But he soon turned to more socially conscious messages, calling for an end to gun violence in ''Murderer,'' promoting condom use in ''Willy (Don't Be Silly),'' citing biblical language and invoking Jah.</p>
        <p>His songs began counseling forgiveness, hard work, getting an education and staying honest. At the same time he broadened his music. He started singing as well as toasting, while his band, Shiloh, held on to the stop-time syncopations of dancehall while adding roots reggae, gospel, ska and electronic touches to the music. It has become one of the most forward-looking bands in reggae.</p>
        <p>The band showed all its skills on Sunday, while Mr. Banton often played up the contrast between his rough-edged voice and a smooth backdrop. He seized melodies with the fervor of Peter Tosh or let his female backup singers sustain a tune as he sang and declaimed between phrases, like Ray Charles with the Raelettes.</p>
        <p>He toasted with his old gusto while the audience roared, and in ''Bona Fide Love,'' he bounced his most raucous declarations against the crooning of Wayne Wonder. After his most rambunctious boasts, he returned to prayer. He sang the 23rd Psalm with Gramps, a member of Morgan Heritage, as he does on his new album, ''Unchained Spirit'' (Epitaph), and he harmonized with his group on the Lord's Prayer. When the crowd demanded an encore, he memorialized Amadou Diallo, the Haitian immigrant who was shot by police officers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Banton was the headliner on an extensive bill. Shiloh backed Mr. Wonder in his own set, a medley of songs strung together like a disc jockey's megamix. The band hopped from roots reggae to dancehall to sparse electronic blips to hints of salsa, while Mr. Wonder crooned about hard workdays and endless love.</p>
        <p>Another band, the Kingston Crew, backed the saxophonist Sedgwick Brooks in a jazz-tinged ska tune and played reggae for two more crooners, Kane Juice and Patrick Jr. The band Pilfers opened the show, shifting between reggae verses and power-chorded heavy-metal choruses in a hybrid it called ''ragga-core.'' Though part of the audience booed, the songs had a welcome vitality.</p>
