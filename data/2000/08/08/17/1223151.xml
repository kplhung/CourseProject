        <p>It will be an emotional P.G.A. Championship for Jack Nicklaus, whose mother, Helen, died today at age 90, in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Nicklaus will play in the tournament, just as his mother would have wanted. Helen Nicklaus had been in failing health for several years, making one of her last public appearances at this year's Memorial Tournament, where her son was honored for his lifetime contributions to golf.</p>
        <p>Nicklaus canceled a scheduled news conference this afternoon, but Jim Awtrey, chief executive of the PGA of America, spoke in Nicklaus's behalf. Awtrey said that Nicklaus would receive a distinguished service award tonight in Louisville from the PGA of America as scheduled.</p>
        <p>''I just had a conversation with Jack Nicklaus about 30 minutes ago,'' Awtrey said. ''Jack had spent time with her Monday before coming here and had discussions with her. He indicated that she was prepared for death, that she had been ill and she was ready. Given what she had been through, he felt that was a blessing.</p>
        <p>''He will honor her wishes and participate this evening in receiving the distinguished service award, and he will play in the golf tournament. By doing so, he is honoring her wishes. Any additional information I am sure will come from the family.''</p>
        <p>Nicklaus's father, Charlie, died in 1970 at age 56.</p>
