        <p>WHEN you think of Louisville sports, you think of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs, or Muhammad Ali, who now has a boulevard named for him. Or you think of all those Louisville Slugger bats; the new minor league baseball stadium, Louisville Slugger Field, with a statue out front of Pee Wee Reese, a local marbles champion who grew up to be the captain and shortstop of the ''Boys of Summer'' Brooklyn Dodgers.</p>
        <p>But with Tiger Woods in town, golf is suddenly center stage in Louisville as never before.</p>
        <p>When Mark Brooks won the 1996 Professional Golfers Association Championship in a sudden-death playoff with Kenny Perry here at the Valhalla Golf Club, they put themselves and Louisville on the golf map, but only briefly.</p>
        <p>Neither has won a PGA Tour event since then, and Valhalla hasn't had another tournament until now.</p>
        <p>Tiger Woods is at Valhalla to defend the P.G.A. title he won last year in a back-nine duel with the now 20-year-old Sergio Garcia of Spain at Medinah No. 3 outside Chicago.</p>
        <p>Even more important, the world will be watching to see if the reigning United States Open and British Open champion can be the first to win three consecutive major titles (or even three in one year) since Ben Hogan won the Masters and the two Opens in 1953.</p>
        <p>But as well as Woods is likely to play, the P.G.A. has a recent history of somewhat surprising champions, occasionally even somebody who emerged from relative obscurity.</p>
        <p>Woods dominated this year's two Opens as no other golfer ever has, winning by 15 strokes at Pebble Beach and by 8 at St. Andrews. But the more difficult the course, the more it favors a dominant golfer. If Brooks and Perry were the best at Valhalla in 1996, maybe less familiar names will create another P.G.A. dogfight for Woods, who openly sighed in relief when his winning putt fell last year.</p>
        <p>Life is like that at the P.G.A., where the course is seldom set up as treacherously as an Open course and where so many golfers have had a chance to win. Over the last quarter of a century, the P.G.A. has had many more first-time or only-time major winners than the Masters and the two Opens.</p>
        <p>Since 1975, there have been 10 golfers whose P.G.A. title has been their only major -- Davis Love III, Steve Elkington, Paul Azinger, Wayne Grady, Jeff Sluman, Bob Tway, Hal Sutton, John Mahaffey and Lanny Wadkins, as well as Brooks. And since 1975, the P.G.A. was the first major for six players who went on to win other majors -- Vijay Singh, Nick Price, John Daly, Payne Stewart, Larry Nelson and David Graham.</p>
        <p>Over that same span, the Masters was the only major for only four golfers, and each of the Opens was the only major for six.</p>
        <p>So while Woods, according to the oddsmaker Danny Sheridan, is an even-money favorite, look for somebody else to challenge him, if not dethrone him -- maybe Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson or a mystery guest (as Garcia was last year).</p>
        <p>Especially at Valhalla, designed by Jack Nicklaus, who will be playing with Woods and Singh today and tomorrow.</p>
        <p>''It sets up well for anybody who hits the ball high,'' Woods said. ''That's the way Nicklaus courses are designed. You've got to bring the ball in high. I've traditionally played well on Nicklaus courses.''</p>
        <p>But why Valhalla? Isn't Valhalla just the name of the great hall where the souls of Viking heroes feasted and celebrated with the gods? And why is it suddenly Tiger Woods's latest stage for a major title?</p>
        <p>In golf, major championships are usually held at courses aged by time, tradition and history. In contrast, Valhalla is even younger than Tiger Woods and nowhere near as mature. He's 24, it's only 14.</p>
        <p>But the P.G.A. is here because the PGA of America, which rules the nation's club pros, owns 50 percent of the Valhalla Golf Club and by year's end will own all of it. The P.G.A. is scheduled to return here in 2006, followed by the Ryder Cup matches in 2007.</p>
        <p>Even Woods has said that an older, more traditional course, like Baltusrol, the New Jersey brute that has held seven United States Opens, would have been a ''better fit'' for the 2000 majors. So don't be surprised if somebody else's name is a better fit on the P.G.A. trophy.</p>
