        <p>Jon S. Corzine, New Jersey's Democratic nominee for the United States Senate, gave an energetic speech today on the floor of the Staples Center in his debut on the national stage. And hardly anyone saw it.</p>
        <p>His own state's delegates were off having lunch at an Irish pub. A half-dozen Corzine campaign workers rounded up obliging partisans from Maine, New Hampshire and Minnesota -- ''I'll give you $300,'' one Corzine supporter was overheard saying, apparently in jest -- to fill New Jersey's seats, wave signs, howl at the applause lines and chant his name. ''Cor-ZEEN!'' a few shouted, until they were corrected.</p>
        <p>It was, after all, only a little after 1 p.m., California time.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. COR-zyne said he had enjoyed his moment under the lights, despite having felt ''butterflies'' beforehand. And this has been a very different convention experience for him. In 1996, when he was merely the co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, he spent only one night with the Democrats in Chicago. After giving more than $150,000 to the party and raising much more than that from others, he was rewarded with a skybox seat during President Clinton's acceptance speech, the week's most coveted ticket.</p>
        <p>This time around, Mr. Corzine's schedule has been grueling and mostly unglamorous: As official head of the New Jersey delegation, he has to sit through each morning's two-hour program of political speeches over breakfast at the New Jersey contingent's hotel. And he is doing his best to sell himself to local political leaders who had opposed him in the primary and to journalists who have been critical of his campaign spending.</p>
        <p>But at times, Mr. Corzine still seems to be treated more like a well-meaning fund-raiser than a political force in his own right.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's largess toward New Jersey Democrats did not stop at the airport in Newark. For example, he put together $37,500 to buy 250 tickets to the postconvention concert on Thursday starring Barbra Streisand and others, a benefit for the Democratic National Committee. And he is throwing a lavish party for the delegation at Luna Park in West Hollywood after the concert.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine gave a smaller, private luncheon on Sunday in Santa Monica, where he was greeted by Senators John Kerry, Charles S. Robb and Tom Daschle as if he were already a colleague. Supporters say there is reason to be sanguine: Internal polls, they say, show him as much as 16 points ahead of his Republican rival, Representative Bob Franks.</p>
        <p>The luncheon provided another stark contrast between the two campaigns. At the Republican convention in Philadelphia, Mr. Franks spent his days clamoring for attention, pleading for $1,000 checks and arranging for events around the country that, he hopes, might attract wealthy donors to invest in his candidacy despite the possibility that he could be outspent by Mr. Corzine by as much as 5-to-1.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, meanwhile, had no trouble drawing such deep-pocketed Democratic givers as Eli Broad, the billionaire largely responsible for luring the convention to Los Angeles, and Preston R. Tisch of the Loews Corporation conglomerate, to his luncheon.</p>
        <p>But he let his audience know that he didn't want its money for himself. Rather, he asked for contributions to New Jersey's coordinated campaign, which officials say will spend more than $4 million on combined efforts on behalf of the party's presidential, Congressional and even local races.</p>
        <p>''In New Jersey, the candidate running may be able to do some things for himself in his own campaign,'' Mr. Corzine said in a third-person understatement. ''We have the ability to make sure Corzine 2000 does fine. But we work as a team, it's a seamless thing. I hope when I come knocking on your door in the next few weeks, you'll know it's not for Jon Corzine.''</p>
        <p>In his three-minute speech today, Mr. Corzine touched on familiar issues but without the liberal language that characterized his primary campaign.</p>
        <p>''We live in a time of tremendous prosperity,'' he said, ''a time when Democrats have transformed record surpluses from record deficits. It is our duty to use this prosperity to address the unmet needs of the American people.''</p>
        <p>But he made no mention of his platform, which calls for heavy spending on health care, long-term care and education. Instead, he said, ''We must be bold in responding and proposing ideas that fit within our means and pay down the debt.''</p>
        <p>Two aides to Mr. Franks, who managed to obtain convention passes from someone they called a ''sympathetic New Jersey Democrat,'' seized on Mr. Corzine's toned-down  language as a flip-flop.</p>
        <p>''He didn't say 'universal' once,'' said Michael DuHaime, Mr. Franks's deputy campaign manager. ''He spent $35 million promising universal this and universal that, and now he's backing off.''</p>
