        <p>What was supposed to have been a simple hearing on whether a scientist accused of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets should be released on bail turned today into a bitterly contentious preview of his trial.</p>
        <p>Bail hearings are generally brief, with decisions usually rendered with relative speed. But this is the third bail hearing for Wen Ho Lee, a former nuclear weapons scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory,  and as it moves into a second day it has illustrated the unusual gulf between what is in the 59-count indictment and what the government contends that Dr. Lee actually intended.</p>
        <p>He is charged with illegally moving the secret data to an unsecure computer and portable computer tapes, some of which are missing, with the intent to harm the United States. The government has said further that Dr. Lee, 60, had been motivated largely by a desire to find a new job -- most likely with an American ally -- and intended to use the tapes to enhance his prospects. But most of the bail hearing today, and a previous one in December, focused on the question of espionage, of which he is not accused.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the issue is the significance of the trove of nuclear data that Dr. Lee is accused of downloading. Two witnesses appeared in Federal District Court here today: John Richter, a former top nuclear weapons designer and intelligence official at Los Alamos, and C. Paul Robinson, the president of the Sandia National Laboratories.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richter, who is highly familiar with the obscure computer codes that Dr. Lee is accused of downloading, said perhaps 99 percent of the information had already been made public in various forums and would not be that useful to a foreign country. Asked if national security would be harmed if the tapes found their way into foreign hands, Dr. Richter replied, ''I don't believe that it would have any deleterious affect at all.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Robinson maintained that if the tapes landed in hostile hands, the global balance of power could be shifted. ''I've never seen anything even close to it in approximation of the potential damage,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The hearing is scheduled to continue on Thursday before Judge James A. Parker.</p>
