        <p>He sprinted off the mound and jumped over the foul line after each inning. He sat in the same corner seat in the first-base dugout and placed his glove and his cap to his left. He buried his face in a wet towel and he tried to remain calm in a tense setting.</p>
        <p>Brian Sikorski was stopping the mighty Yankees in his major league debut, stopping a team that has snared three of the last four World Series titles and a team that regularly antagonizes the Texas Rangers. So Sikorski tried to think about the present, not the past, and visualized how each inning would unfold.</p>
        <p>Sikorski never strayed from his routine or from throwing an assortment of fastballs, sinkers and changeups, and the Yankees never solved him in tumbling to a 5-0 loss at the Ballpark in Arlington. Orlando Hernandez had a spotty performance in losing his fourth straight start, including the last three since being activated from the disabled list on Aug. 6.</p>
        <p>It seemed improbable, but Sikorski, the rookie, was much sharper than El Duque, who used to be the Yankees' ace.</p>
        <p>''It's weird,'' Sikorski said. ''You think about throwing a no-hitter. Last night, it was tough to sleep. I wondered what tonight was going to be like and what was going to happen. It happened just like I imagined it.''</p>
        <p>Joe Torre imagined something different. When Torre talked about Hernandez  before the game, the Yankee manager boldly said, ''I would be surprised if he didn't pitch well tonight.''</p>
        <p>He was surprised, all right, after the Yankees finished the road trip at 3-3, but not entirely with El Duque, who gave up four earned runs in seven innings; Torre was more surprised with Sikorski. The 26-year old right-hander held the Yankees scoreless into the eighth and did not surrender a hit in eight at-bats with runners in scoring position.</p>
        <p>''This guy pitched out there like he's been there a long time,'' said Luis Polonia, the left fielder who made one error and should have been charged with another in plays that helped lead to three Texas runs.</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams said: ''It was pretty much what we heard he was going to throw. We just couldn't hit it.''</p>
        <p>While Torre said that Hernandez ''was a lot better'' than he had been in yielding 12 earned runs in his previous 10 1/3 innings, the fact remains that El Duque has not won since July 7 and could be the biggest question mark on the staff.</p>
        <p>''Simply, I don't like to lose,'' said Hernandez, who accidentally knocked over two chairs as he bolted from the clubhouse.</p>
        <p>Hernandez's downfall tonight began when Mike Lamb ended a nine-pitch at-bat by lining a single a few inches past the pitcher's glove in the third inning and scored on Luis Alicea's single. An inning later, Rafael Palmeiro, who had been 1 for 19 in his career off El Duque, smashed a hanging slider inside the right-field foul pole to make it 2-0.</p>
        <p>The game got messier in the fifth as Torre's revolving door in left field hurt the Yankees. With two out, Hernandez walked Alicea and gave up a single to Frank Catalanotto. Rusty Greer hit a sinking line drive and Polonia, who started in left so David Justice could rest as the designated hitter, charged in and stopped as he lost the ball in the lights.</p>
        <p>Polonia turned his head, and the ball deflected off his leg and rolled away for a two-run triple. Polonia also misplayed a short-hop single in the seventh, letting Royce Clayton go to second. Clayton scored two batters later. ''I just hope one bad play is not a negative for the whole season,'' Polonia said. ''I know I'm better than that.''</p>
        <p>Sikorski, who was 10-9 with a 4.04 earned run average for Class AAA Oklahoma, was recalled after Ryan Glynn was put on the disabled list. Heflew here from Las Vegas this morning. Glynn fainted during his last start. Sikorski flourished in his first start.</p>
        <p>He walked Derek Jeter in the first, but the Yankees stranded Jeter at second. Justice singled and Tino Martinez doubled in the second, but Sikorski struck out Jorge Posada and Scott Brosius on 0-2 fastballs, and after Jose Vizcaino walked, Polonia grounded out.</p>
        <p>Jeter doubled to open the third, but Sikorski retired 13 straight Yankees as he kept visualizing positive developments while giving up only four hits for the night. Paul Rigdon of the Minnesota Twins also beat the Yankees in his debut this season.</p>
        <p>When Sikorski was replaced by Mike Venafro in the eighth, he raced off the mound, hopped over the white line and sat in the corner of the dugout. Sikorski did not stay there long as the fans, mindful that the Yankees had won 10 straight games from the Rangers in the regular season and the postseason, cheered.</p>
        <p>''To tell you the truth, I didn't even know what was going on,'' Sikorski said. ''It was real special.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>One day after Manager JOE TORRE said he was ''concerned'' about CHUCK KNOBLAUCH'S lingering trouble with his right elbow, General Manager BRIAN CASHMAN said he feels the second baseman will return this season. Still, the Yankees will not even guess at a return date. ''My expectations are, from talking to the doctors and trainers, that this should go away,'' said Cashman. ''I would be surprised if it doesn't.'' . . . JOSE CANSECO is trying to lose at least 10 pounds from his 255-pound frame to help his injured left heel and possibly enable him to play the outfield. ''I would love to give Joe the option to put me back out there,'' Canseco said. Torre does not want to play Canseco in the outfield much, but wants the added flexibility. . . . GABE KAPLER of the Rangers went 0 for 4, ending his hitting streak at 28 games, the longest in the majors this season.</p>
