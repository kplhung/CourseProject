        <p>As Al Gore tinkers with the final version of his address to the nation, his speech has come together in what he and his aides describe as a political self-portrait: heavy on personal biography, policy detail and a vision for the future, all composed in his own hand and in his precise syntax.</p>

        <p>As Al Gore tinkers with the final version of his address to the nation, his speech has come together in what he and his aides describe as a political self-portrait: heavy on personal biography, policy detail and a vision for the future, all composed in his own hand and in his precise syntax.</p>
        <p>''This is a speech I have written; I will deserve the credit or the blame,'' he told reporters on Air Force Two as he traveled this morning from Michigan to accept his party's nomination at the Democratic National Convention here.</p>
        <p>His aides emphasized that more than anything, Mr. Gore hoped to seize the moment and present himself as the leader of his party. This has been the plan all along, now that President Clinton has left the convention and the two staged a symbolic ''passing the torch'' ceremony in Michigan on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''This is his main chance to be the main guy,'' Carter Eskew, Mr. Gore's top media adviser, said. ''That's something he's been looking forward to for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman, said, ''The scepter is in his hand.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore suggested that he wanted to present a unifying vision of himself, connecting his policies with his life experiences.</p>
        <p>''I hope that those who watch and listen will feel afterward that they have a clearer idea of exactly what I'm proposing to do,'' Mr. Gore told reporters. ''They'll also know how the ideas and proposals I'm making are rooted in the experiences that I've had. I'll give a few specific examples. I'll tell them why I feel as strongly as I do about the choices we have to make.''</p>
        <p>Clearly buoyant, Mr. Gore held two rallies here today before watching his oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, place his name in nomination at the convention.</p>
        <p>As he had in the last few days on the campaign trail, Mr. Gore, while he talked with reporters on his plane and at the rallies today, discussed his speech, saying it would be heavy on policy details.</p>
        <p>''I believe that you deserve to know exactly what the candidates are proposing to do so you can make an informed judgment,'' he said to cheers at a rally in a hangar at the Burbank, Calif., airport, with Air Force Two parked in the background. ''I'm going to tell you!''</p>
        <p>At a second rally on the Warner Brothers studio lot, he called his decision to discuss policy details as a political ''risk,'' saying, ''Tomorrow night when I address the convention, I'm going to take the risk of laying out some specifics.''</p>
        <p>Aides said this was a deliberate counterpoint to criticism that Mr. Gore comes across as too cautious and calculating.</p>
        <p>''I believe it's time for all of us to come together and lift up the ideal of the best America that we can move toward,'' he said in Burbank, in a faint echo of John F. Kennedy's speech when he accepted the Democratic presidential nomination 40 years ago in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''In every generation we have to make the hard choices between one direction or another, between going back to the past or forward to the future,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Let others argue the case for the old guard. We're the new guard, and we're going to bring positive change to the United States of America.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eskew said that the speech describes differences with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Mr. Gore's Republican rival, but that it remains ''respectful.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he began working on the speech two months ago, rewriting it with advice from Mr. Eskew and Bob Shrum, his top message and media advisers, and Eli Attie, his speechwriter. Mr. Gore has been tapping the speech out on a laptop computer and the aides have been exchanging copies of it by computer disk. President Clinton, by contrast, prefers to write longhand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore ''goes through a process where he gets a draft and looks at it and signs off on certain sections and zeroes in on things he wants to refine and tweak,'' Mr. Eskew said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, and their wives, Tipper and Hadassah, drove in a motorcade from the Burbank airport to the Warner Brothers studios, where they were greeted by convention delegations from Tennessee and Connecticut -- the ''home folks,'' as Mr. Gore called them.</p>
        <p>Noting that the television series, ''The West Wing,'' was produced on the lot, Mr. Lieberman said of Mr. Bush: ''The closest George Bush will get to the West Wing is a remote control!''</p>
        <p>THE DEMOCRATS: THE PREPARATION  Correction:  August 18, 2000, Friday  Headlines and picture captions in some copies yesterday referred incorrectly to the formal status of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's nomination for vice president. The Democratic National Covention nominated him officially last night. When he addressed the convention on Wednesday, was not officially the nominee.</p>
