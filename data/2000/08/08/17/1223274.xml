        <p>Among the demonstrators greeting Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, on a Harlem sidewalk today was a tall, bearish man dressed casually in khaki pants and a dark golf shirt and clutching a couple of slips of paper.</p>
        <p>It was none other than Howard Wolfson, the communications director and a top adviser for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign, who came for one of the more unusual recent stunts intended to tarnish Mr. Lazio's appearances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfson, responding to Mr. Lazio's quip Tuesday that he would release his state income tax return in 15 minutes if Mrs. Clinton did the same (as a resident for six months, she would have no such return), sought to thrust on him copies of Mrs. Clinton's property tax bills from her home in Chappaqua. Disclosure of the $17,368.64 in payments on those bills, Mr. Wolfson reasoned, complied with the spirit of Mr. Lazio's challenge, which followed demands by Democrats that he release his federal income tax returns.</p>
        <p>''If he says he can release them in 15 minutes, why doesn't he?'' Mr. Wolfson asked reporters as he stood near a Democratic Party operative dressed as Uncle Sam and shouted for Mr. Lazio to release his tax return. Mr. Lazio has said repeatedly he will do so this month. President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton released their return in April.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, told of Mr. Wolfson's presence after a speech at the National Black Theater, did not acknowledge the visitor as he left behind a curtain of police officers, who  blocked Mr. Wolfson's way.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfson declined to hand the papers to Patrick McCarthy, a Lazio spokesman, as Mr. Lazio boarded his campaign bus to continue a tour across the state that began today and concludes Monday. This evening, he was at the Delaware County Fair here.</p>
        <p>The Clinton campaign, seeking to rebut Mr. Lazio's questioning of Mrs. Clinton's character and integrity, has taken up the issue of his not releasing his tax returns -- a ritual expected of candidates these days -- as a way to question Mr. Lazio's own character.</p>
        <p>But more than anything, the episode highlighted the effort by the Clinton campaign and its supporters to rain on Mr. Lazio's campaign. Mr. Lazio's staff, in turn, has grown irritated at the intrusions that they say only reinforce what they consider the negative tenor of the first lady's campaign.</p>
        <p>''It was a cheap political stunt,'' Mr. McCarthy said afterward, asserting it only reaffirmed that Mrs. Clinton could not produce state income tax returns because ''she is not really from New York.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfson is not the only assistant to Mrs. Clinton making his presence known on the opponent's trail. Employing a common campaign tactic, a young man from the Clinton campaign trails Mr. Lazio with a small video camera at nearly all of the congressman's appearances, without disrupting them. (Mr. Lazio, who says he does not employ such a tracker, has come to know ''Eric'' and even gave him a slice of pizza and a MetroCard at a recent event.)</p>
        <p>There is also ''Uncle Sam,'' who has become a fixture at Mr. Lazio's events this past week, with a Lazio spokesman wrestling him away from the podium before a news conference Monday. And demonstrators from abortion rights groups have waved placards questioning Mr. Lazio's commitment to abortion rights.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mrs. Clinton is often greeted at her appearances by protesters from anti-abortion groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio received a mixed reaction in Harlem, one of the traditionally Democratic areas he says his campaign will seek to reach.</p>
        <p>As his bus approached the theater, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, one of the most influential in the city, tapped on the door and greeted Mr. Lazio, who stepped off momentarily. Mr. Butts said he had made no endorsement in the race and might not do so, but he had kind words for the congressman.</p>
        <p>''I have found the Republican administration in the state of New York has been extremely helpful for the things we have done here in Harlem, as well as for the things we hope to do in the future,'' Mr. Butts said after embracing Mr. Lazio and inviting him to the church. He said he had discussed Mr. Lazio's candidacy favorably with Gov. George E. Pataki.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Lazio sprinkled references to Langston Hughes in his largely autobiographical speech before 200 mostly elderly residents gathered for lunch at a Harlem Week 2000 celebration.</p>
