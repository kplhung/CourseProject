        <p>The prime-time network television audience for the convention, though strong on the first night, when President Clinton spoke, had died down considerably by yesterday.</p>
        <p>CBS covered the convention from 10 to 10:30 p.m., during the first half of ''60 Minutes II.'' According to Nielsen Media Research, that portion of the program was watched by about 5.3 million viewers.

        <p>The prime-time network television audience for the convention, though strong on the first night, when President Clinton spoke, had died down considerably by yesterday.</p>
        <p>CBS covered the convention from 10 to 10:30 p.m., during the first half of ''60 Minutes II.'' According to Nielsen Media Research, that portion of the program was watched by about 5.3 million viewers. ABC covered the convention in prime time from 10 to 11 p.m. yesterday, and an estimated 5.8 million viewers watched its coverage. NBC ignored the convention in prime time. Instead, it showed an edition of ''Dateline,'' watched by about 11 million viewers.</p>
        <p>On Monday, 17.2 million people watched the network's prime-time coverage of the convention, far more than the 11 million people who watched network coverage of the first night of the Republican convention. But the Republicans proved a bigger draw on their second night than did the Democrats. Night 2 of the Republican convention, covered in part by NBC, CBS and ABC, drew a network audience of 15.1 million people.</p>
        <p>The network audience for the second night of this year's Democratic convention was also smaller than the one for Night 2 of the 1996 Democratic convention, which was shown on all three networks and had an audience of 17.5 million.</p>
        <p>Cable also had a generally smaller audience yesterday than on Monday. While the audiences of CNN and Fox were considerably lower, MSNBC saw a slight increase. CNN was watched by 1.5 million people yesterday, nearly 17 percent fewer than had watched on Monday.</p>
