        <p>As Tampa Bay forward Mamadou Diallo's third goal of the game rolled into the net in overtime last night, the visiting MetroStars' night of woe was complete: defeat added to injury. And it left them steaming.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars suffered a blow to their Major League Soccer title hopes when their regular goalkeeper, Mike Ammann, suffered three broken ribs, likely ending his season, after being accidentally kicked by Diallo in last night's game in Tampa. Fla. The MetroStars' backup goalie, Tim Howard, was named to the United States Olympic team on Tuesday and will not be with the MetroStars the entire month of September.</p>
        <p>''It's called a mugging,'' MetroStars General Manager Nick Sakiewicz said of Diallo's action. ''This is devastating for us. I've tried to play with broken ribs. He's through for the year.''</p>
        <p>Forward Alex Comas scored twice for the MetroStars, including a goal in the 85th minute to tie the game at 3-3, but Diallo gave the Mutiny a 4-3 victory in the second minute of the second five-minute sudden-death overtime period at Raymond James Stadium.</p>
        <p>With the MetroStars leading by 1-0 in the 29th minute, Ammann sprinted out to smother a loose ball and was hit in the head by Diallo's right leg and apparently in the ribs with his left leg.</p>
        <p>MetroStars Coach Octavio Zambrano was upset after the game. ''It's amazing that the guy who should have been red-carded and is offside when he scores the winning goal is the star of the game,'' he said.</p>
