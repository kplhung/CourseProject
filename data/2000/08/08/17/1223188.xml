        <p>With puns, jokes and a touch of naughty wordplay, President Abdurrahman Wahid lifted the mood of Indonesia's bitterly feuding legislature today, soothing it with the fundamental message of his presidency: debate and disagreement are acceptable, even healthy.</p>
        <p>In an extemporaneous address that epitomized the sea change he has brought to politics and leadership in Indonesia, Mr. Wahid drew repeated laughter, sometimes chuckling himself as he spoke.</p>
        <p>The 700 legislators, who had greeted him mostly with hostility throughout the bulk of a two-week special session, interrupted him frequently with applause.</p>
        <p>Divided among themselves, against the president and along religious and political lines, they found themselves applauding when Mr. Wahid stated his credo of ''tolerance, diversity and the rule of law.''</p>
        <p>Ten months into his presidency, Indonesia continues to struggle with widespread violence, economic stagnation and political infighting. Though he is disorganized and politically weak, Mr. Wahid has offered at least a democratic compass as Indonesia seeks to reorient itself after three decades of dictatorship under  former President Suharto.</p>
        <p>His message of the free exchange of ideas has not yet taken root in a society where public differences can be seen as taboo and disagreement can be taken as enmity.</p>
        <p>Today, he was once again the Muslim teacher of his roots, using humor, parables and indirection to make his points. And he reminded the assembly, meeting on Indonesia's 55th National Day, of the nation's credo: unity in diversity.</p>
        <p>The change he offers is a shift in emphasis. Where Mr. Suharto, employing the strong arm of the military, enforced unquestioning unity, Mr. Wahid celebrates diversity.</p>
        <p>Seeking to defuse tensions, he joked about the multiplicity of languages, ethnicities and religions in this sprawling archipelago and its 210 million people. At one point, he startled the legislature into laughter by making a pun on a political acronym and producing the words ''hanging out your underwear.''</p>
        <p>''So here's an example of how we are different, but we use tradition in our daily lives to accommodate our differences,'' he said over the laughter.</p>
        <p>Then, using a characteristic turn of phrase, he said: ''We shouldn't make a big deal out of it. It's normal. I hope we can be mature enough to discuss any kind of problem that we have, because each of us has his own ideas.'' The same diversity was welcome in the legislature itself, the president said. ''I've been very impressed with this assembly,'' he said. ''We have had an open debate and this showed that we have a warm brotherhood and people can speak their minds. We don't have to be worried or suspicious because there is no regime to haunt us.''</p>
        <p>Making an example of a contentious issue of the moment, he said he welcomed opposition to his proposal to lift a ban on Communism, a move he has described as part of his philosophy of inclusiveness. But he said he too had the right to his opinion.</p>
        <p>''It is a good dialogue in the right place,'' he said, ''and in full view of the public so that the public can contribute its own ideas.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''It's nothing to be ashamed of if we express different opinions. It's something we should be proud of because it is the realization of our credo, unity in diversity.''</p>
