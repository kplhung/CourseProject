        <p>In terms of speed, the New York Minute seems to have been eclipsed by Internet Time. Compared with the almost instant gratification of e-mail, waiting for an overnight courier to deliver a package can feel like waiting for a glacier to move.</p>
        <p>NextJet, a new company based in Dallas, is aiming to fill the needs of people who need materials delivered the same day, no matter where they live in the United States.</p>
        <p>In creating a system that can get a package from Point A to Point B by the fastest means possible, NextJet has developed a custom database that combines the schedules of 30,000 commercial airline flights, along with the availability of 300 ground couriers.</p>
        <p>To use the service, a customer can either call (888) 639-8538 or visit the company's Web site at www.nextjet.com. On the Web site, the customer can enter the recipient's and the sender's ZIP codes in a form on the page and quickly get several price quotations and estimated delivery times for door-to-door service.</p>
        <p>To send a 10-pound package from Manhattan to Beverly Hills on a Wednesday afternoon, for example, costs about $200. The package would leave New York around 1:30 p.m. Eastern time and arrive in California about 7:10 p.m. Pacific time. Customers can track their shipments on the NextJet Web site.</p>
        <p>To those who desperately need shipments as soon as possible, the slightly higher cost may be well worth it, in terms of both productivity and antacid tablets.</p>
