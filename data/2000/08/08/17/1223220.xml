        <p>Every so often a team of market researchers shows up at one or another Metro-North Railroad station to gauge commuters' interest in high-speed ferry service from Connecticut to New York City.

        <p>Every so often a team of market researchers shows up at one or another Metro-North Railroad station to gauge commuters' interest in high-speed ferry service from Connecticut to New York City. And every once in a while, business and community leaders  board a boat for a much-publicized test run,  like the one in May from Stamford to East 34th Street, to show that the trip can be faster by water than by car or train.</p>
        <p>But the vision of a ferry ride from Fairfield County to the financial district, without the clogged traffic on I-95 or a struggle through the harried crowds at Grand Central Terminal, remains unrealized. At least three different companies that are trying to make it a reality have encountered numerous obstacles, from difficulty in raising capital to regulatory bureaucracy to local concerns about parking.</p>
        <p>One company, SeaConn L.L.C. of New Haven, which initially projected that its planned fleet of super-fast luxury ferries would be launched in the spring of 1999, now says that service will not begin until the end of 2001 or later. Another company, Lighthouse Landings Inc., which currently operates ferries between New York and New Jersey, had hoped to begin Connecticut service this summer but has postponed it until next May or June at the earliest.</p>
        <p>And a third company, U.S. Multi-Hull Inc., which had been all set in late 1997 to start fast catamaran service from Norwalk to La Guardia Airport, has dropped that idea, at least for the time being. Instead, the company will focus on a potential ferry run between New Haven and Rye, N.Y., with four stops in between, for commuters who live in one suburb and work in another. But the company's owner, Dale Strand, said he had no idea when that service might begin -- if ever -- and that most likely it would not be profitable without a subsidy from the state.</p>
        <p>''We have all been fighting the armies, haven't we,'' Mr. Strand said of himself and his struggling competitors. ''Everybody has a different battlefront I guess.'' Mr. Strand's effort to start a Norwalk to La Guardia route was stymied by Norwalk officials. Concerned about traffic, parking and environmental problems near the city's Cove Marina, they threatened endless delays for zoning and other approvals.</p>
        <p>For the president of SeaConn, Doren Voetch, who has the most ambitious plans, the battle has been raising capital to pay for his vision of a fleet of super-fast ''pentamarans,'' boats built with five hulls for speed and stability. Each boat, with luxurious business class amenities, would cost about $22 million. Mr. Voetch said that he had finally found a backer to finance his first three boats, but that it had taken  much longer than he had expected.</p>
        <p>The text on the company's jazzy Web site, www.seaconn.com, is overly optimistic: ''Coming in the Spring of 2001, the first major advance in transportation in the Connecticut/ Manhattan Corridor in 50 years.''</p>
        <p>''We're not going to make that,'' Mr. Voetch conceded. ''The Web site has not been updated recently.''</p>
        <p>Now that the financing is in place, Mr. Voetch faces a barrage of details: legal documents to be drawn up, vendors to hire, bids to consider for building the boats. But the highest hurdle has been cleared, he said. ''We have never been more certain that we are going to be in the water and operating.''</p>
        <p>For cities like Bridgeport and Stamford, the ferries offer easier commuting for residents who work in New York, but they could also  make it feasible for residents of New York City or Long Island to take jobs in Connecticut without a miserable commute. And for companies with business relationships on both sides of Long Island Sound, the ferries would allow face-to-face meetings.</p>
        <p>''When you look at the rest of the world, if you are in Hong Kong, if you are in Denmark, if you are in many parts of the world, ferry service is part of daily life,'' said Denis W. Patterson, Stamford's senior executive officer of economic development. ''People use it. As a concept, we are very enthusiastic about it and it's been very well received by the business community. There is a tremendous level of excitement here.''</p>
        <p>Lighthouse Landings Inc. hopes to be the first company to offer Stamford-to-New York service. The company's president, Anthony Cappaze, said it had recently signed a contract with Derecktor Shipyard in Mamaroneck, N.Y., to build the first of three new boats for the Connecticut route.</p>
        <p>In addition to the completion of its first new boat, Mr. Cappaze said, Lighthouse Landings was awaiting approval -- another source of potential delay -- from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on numerous issues, including its proposed dock in Stamford.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cappaze said that his company's boats, which would hold up to 350 passengers, would travel at speeds of up to 40 knots, or 46 miles an hour. He expected the trip from Stamford to Wall Street would take about an hour, cutting as much as a half-hour off the trip each way for commuters who now take Metro-North and switch to the subway at Grand Central. A ticket for 40 trips would cost about $535, including parking, he estimated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Voetch has even grander plans, with even faster boats. SeaConn's pentamarans, with a capacity similar to Lighthouse Landings' boats, have six engines each and are expected to travel at speeds of up to 72 knots, about 83 miles an hour. For a commuter from Fairfield, Conn., who now spends close to two hours getting to Lower Manhattan by train, the trip could be cut to about an hour, Mr. Voetch said; the trip from Stamford would be about 45 minutes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Voetch said that a monthly ticket from Stamford would likely cost $637 including parking, but that the ticket would be good for unlimited rides throughout the month. By comparison, a monthly ticket for unlimited rides on Metro-North, for the same route, costs $218.</p>
        <p>''We are really developing a whole new culture,'' Mr. Voetch said. ''Our cheap seats are like business class on an airliner. The upper deck, the club deck, is a much higher level of service.'' He said he believed commuters would pay more to spend less time traveling.</p>
        <p>''We're doing something entirely different,'' he said. ''For the first time that I know of anywhere in the world, we are racing the cars and trains in the same direction that they are going and we are winning.'' Of course, they have to build the boats first.</p>
