        <p>Re ''As Fires Rage, Administration Is Given Blame for Not Acting to Prevent Them'' (news article, Aug. 12):</p>
        <p>The timber industry is trying to use this year's severe fire season to its advantage. Logging companies say they need continued access to national forests in order to thin underbrush, supposedly to reduce fire risk. But the timber industry has no interest in underbrush. When it says ''thinning,'' it means logging the last mature timber on public lands.</p>
        <p>Timber companies will not even bid on a sale unless the offering contains larger, older trees. It is the removal of these medium and large trees that scientists say has caused the increased fire risk on federal lands.</p>
        <p>The fire situation will begin to improve only when the commercial logging program is ended and replaced with an ecological restoration program.</p>
