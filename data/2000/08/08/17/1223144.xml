        <p>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: PRESIDENT SWORN IN -- Hipolito Mejia was sworn in as president, promising to spread the benefits of an economic boom to the poor. The fight against corruption and poverty will be priorities for his center-left Dominican Revolutionary Party government, he said in his speech. Mr. Mejia won the May 16 election on a tide of discontent among voters who felt the nation's economic upturn had sidelined the poor.</p>
