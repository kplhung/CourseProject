        <p>I.B.M. said it would invest $100 million over three years to develop new products and services to help analyze the flood of data being produced by the Human Genome Project and other life sciences research. The company also said it would create a life sciences unit to sell supercomputers, database management systems and e-business services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research institutes. The genome project and related efforts are producing huge amounts of data that must be sifted for the information that could lead to new drugs. I.B.M. said the market for information technology products used in life sciences was expected to grow to more than $9 billion by 2003 from $3.5 billion today.</p>
