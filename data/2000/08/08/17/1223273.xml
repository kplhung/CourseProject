        <p>Transit investigators have determined that a badly rusted rail that had cracked caused a subway derailment north of 59th Street in April,  stranding 1,800 riders underground for more than two hours and leading to chaos throughout the subways. The problem with the rail had been noticed almost a year earlier but was never repaired.</p>
        <p>About two months before the derailment, a special subway car that tests rails using high-frequency sound waves found no fissures in the section of rail, which was badly corroded at its base because of a persistent leak in the tunnel ceiling above the tracks. Investigators said that  the rail probably cracked later, a week or two before the derailment, and that the crack worsened with the pressure of dozens of trains passing over it.</p>
        <p>Just before the arrival of the northbound No. 5 train that derailed the night of April 12, investigators said, an 18-inch piece of rail probably cracked loose under the weight of a No. 4 train that was somehow able to pass over without a problem.</p>
        <p>A track inspector checked the faulty section of rail the night before the derailment, and he did not see a crack. But investigators, who examined the inspector's written reports, found that the inspector had alerted his supervisors as late as April 3 that there were several problems with the rail and the ties beneath it because of the ceiling leak. For some reason, a track inspection supervisor, who is required to reinspect the tracks once every 10 days, did not reinspect that stretch for several months before the derailment.</p>
        <p>Investigators also found that another inspector first reported corroded rails and rotted ties at the location as early as May 31, 1999, but no repairs were ever made.</p>
        <p>In a report on the derailment that was submitted late last month to the Transit Authority's Office of System Safety and obtained yesterday by The New York Times, investigators added that the accident might have been prevented if the Transit Authority had a better system for train operators to report suspected broken rails.</p>
        <p>On the night of the derailment, the operator of a train just ahead of the one that jumped the tracks ''heard a loud noise and felt something unusual'' as she passed over the area, according to the investigators' report. She used her radio to alert supervisors at Grand Central Terminal of the problem.</p>
        <p>But through a series of miscommunications, a train operator driving a southbound train stopped his train in the wrong area to inspect for the reported problem. He found a piece of track that was causing train wheels to shoot showers of sparks. And so, by radio, he warned the driver of the northbound No. 5 train to proceed with caution and watch for sparks as he left the 59th Street station.</p>
        <p>The broken stretch of track was much farther north, however, and so the train operator was probably not traveling as slowly when he passed over it, causing the third, fourth and sixth cars to jump off the tracks, and causing slightly less than $20,000 in damage to the train.</p>
        <p>New York City Transit said yesterday evening that it would not comment on the report because the agency's top officials were still reviewing it. But as a result of the derailment, the agency has already made several changes in the way it deals with corroded tracks and with the protocols for train operators to report possible broken rails.</p>
        <p>Now, according to internal Transit Authority memorandums, if an operator suspects a broken rail, he must stop the train immediately, descend to the roadbed and inspect the rails as far as 600 feet beyond the end of the train.</p>
        <p>The Transit Authority has also directed that all rails corroded at their base must be replaced within 90 days. As of April 12, the agency had identified 880 rails throughout the subway system that were corroded and had still not been replaced.</p>
        <p>In addition, according to Transit Authority documents, corroded rails  must now be marked with bright orange paint, and track inspection supervisors must reinspect all of those locations at least weekly to ensure that cracks are not forming.</p>
