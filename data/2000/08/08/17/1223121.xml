        <p>IN her book-lined Greenwich Village apartment, Judith Young Mallin shuddered, recalling her intimidating brush with a top interior design team. For Ms. Mallin, an expert in Surrealist art, it was like entering a hall of mirrors.</p>
        <p>Divorced, she was undertaking the makeover of a 1910 small-scale loft for her new, single life. With a budget of $200,000 in mind, she agreed to a basic design fee of $15,000 and a construction cost of about $190,000. Unspecified ''additional'' services ''requested by the owner'' would be billed at up to $150 an hour, but because her budget was tight, she avoided any extras, even using her own furniture to avoid the designer markups.</p>
        <p>To her dismay, monthly bills for hourly fees started rolling in, often exceeding $15,000. When the project quickly ballooned to over half a million dollars, she panicked. Demanding a copy of itemized charges, she found it loaded with ''services'' she assumed were included in the fee: meetings, site visits, drafting reviews. Among them was a $150 charge for a discussion the designers had with each other about where to put a giant television set that Ms. Mallin said she had told them she didn't want. She had even been charged for meeting with them on how to scale back the project.</p>
        <p>''It was like trying to keep sand from running through my fingers,'' Ms. Mallin recalled. ''I know artsy people. They don't use decorators, so there was no one for me to call and say, 'What do you do?' And I still feel like I was incredibly naive.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mallin is hardly alone in feeling mugged in a decorating ''incident.'' Few relationships are more fraught with inequalities and potential misunderstandings than the one between client and decorator -- the only mentionable business relationship in which a perfect stranger is in your bedroom within 20 minutes of meeting you, as one designer put it.</p>
        <p>Brian Bedol, a media industry executive, and his wife, Judith, have worked with three decorators in 10 years. The first experience was formative. At one point, the designer suddenly started bringing in pieces that were out of their price range and ordering things without their approval.</p>
        <p>''When we confronted him,'' Mr. Bedol said, ''he told us that we needed to spend more money because he'd lost some clients to the stock market crash. And if we didn't spend more he couldn't keep us on.''</p>
        <p>The services a decorator renders are often impossible to pin down. There is no right way or wrong way to decorate a room. Nor can a price tag be put on taste, or a so-called ''good eye.'' Add to the psychological imbalance the mind-boggling complexity and ever-shifting methods by which designers seek reimbursement for their time-consuming services, which can include weekend shopping at a tag sale and baby-sitting an electronics geek installing your home theater.</p>
        <p>''What you're buying from me is time out of my life,'' said Jarrett Hedborg, the Los Angeles designer, whose clients include Bette Midler, Jack Nicholson and Saudi Arabian royalty and who bills by the hour, with a commission. ''Listen! Me standing around with your whiny plumber is simply going to cost you!''</p>
        <p>In today's flush economy, traditional billing methods are being tested by a savvy new consumer who wants to know what things cost. The old-school approach usually involves a designer's fee plus a markup -- usually 25 to 40 percent -- on all the furnishings the decorator buys at the to-the-trade price. High-society clients used to be too polite (or too snobbish) to ask, ''How much?''</p>
        <p>Thanks to the easy availability of showroom catalogs and glossy design magazines, and the arrival of eBay and Sotheby's and Christie's online, ''people have great access to product now'' and a much better idea what things might cost, said Mayer Rus, editor in chief of Interior Design. It's a moment of transition, ''a watershed moment,'' Mr. Hedborg called it, with designers trying to figure out how to get reasonable fees for their creative services, which have expanded far beyond furniture procurement.</p>
        <p>If the system lends itself to abuse, it's partly because it is largely unregulated. The American Society of Interior Designers, with 20,000 members nationwide and a code of ethics for those who add the A.S.I.D. appellation after their names, sets standards for its members' expertise and education in 19 states, and can reprimand or suspend members who violate the code.</p>
        <p>But no one can put a true price on either the designer's creativity or the client's insecurities. The problem, Mr. Hedborg said, ''is that I'm selling my talent for a price based on an object.''</p>
        <p>''I'd like to think I'm worth more than a table,'' he said. ''It feels smarmy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bedol is one of many clients who feel duped by the markup system. ''I'll never understand a system that gives decorators an incentive to spend as much money as possible,'' he said. ''When I've suggested to a few of them that there could be a bonus for spending less, like they do in commercial work, they just laughed at me.''</p>
        <p>Further complicating the situation, stores like ABC Carpet &amp; Home, Crate &amp; Barrel and other retailers have started producing furniture even a picky decorator might purchase. But what client is going to be happy paying a designer markup on something picked up effortlessly in a place like that?</p>
        <p>While many designers defend the old system as the most equitable and most respectful of the designer's talent, a growing number of younger designers are working more on a business school model as consultants, billing by the hour (built-in protection with indecisive clients), charging an agreed-upon lump sum or a day rate and sometimes even using the client's own credit card to pay for purchases directly.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a shopper,'' said Jennifer Post, one of the new school. ''People hire me for a concept. I bill solely on a project-fee basis, determined by the scope of the project, the time involved and the amount of work. I don't charge any percentage on fabrics, on the construction costs or on the hourly fee. I have my clients' credit cards because they like their free travel points. There's no deceit, no cheating, no paperwork.''</p>
        <p>But even straightforward business methods don't always dispel the mystery and the suspicions that surround decorating, which is all about projecting an image. ''It's always awkward,'' said Marjorie Garber, the author of ''Sex and Real Estate: Why We Love Houses'' (Pantheon), a new book on the social pathologies intricately linked to the home. ''These strangers are supposed to become experts in your taste -- of which you're none too sure yourself. And there's always the worry that if it's not expensive, then you're not getting your money's worth. The money is what makes it glamorous.''</p>
        <p>But glamour can cost. In thrall to a famous New York designer, one couple on the Upper East Side agreed to buy an unusual antique desk with leather drawers for $90,000, based on photographs the designer showed them. When the ''antique'' arrived at their house, a substantial part had been newly remade. It was appraised subsequently for no more than $10,000. They had a hard time returning it.</p>
        <p>''We suspected that the designer and the dealer were very cozy and that there were kickbacks to the advantage of both,'' the wife said. Though they questioned the designer's ethics, they loved his aesthetic and would hire him again -- which is why they refused to give their names. ''If the piece works and you love the look . . . ,'' the woman tried to explain. She blames herself for not ''focusing more'' on particulars.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the American Society of Interior Designers, Jerry R. Harke, strongly urges clients to be more skeptical. ''Whenever you're buying an expensive antique, be sure to get an independent appraisal,'' he said.</p>
        <p>JOHN LANDRUM BRYANT, who sells lighting fixtures, bathroom hardware and furniture to designers and the public by appointment, has seen both sides in action. ''The decorator's role,'' he said, ''is to infantilize the client to the point where the client feels it's impossible to make any decision about anything, be it what furniture to buy, what flowers to put on the table, even what towels to use.''</p>
        <p>As an example, Mr. Bryant cited his own experiences accompanying his interior designer on shopping trips to Paris. ''They always stay in the fancier hotel -- the Ritz, or Costes is very popular -- while you stay somewhere else much more modest,'' he said. ''If you're making a commission on a seven-figure purchase, you can afford to pay for the Ritz, too.'' Besides, he added, ''they have to troll for new clients.''</p>
        <p>High-rolling decorators raise fewer eyebrows than the inscrutable relationship between designers and their sources for custom-made furnishings. Custom design is a highly inexact art, with prices fluctuating depending upon many factors, including the availability of fabric and workers, and the due date. Nearly all of the more than a dozen designers interviewed for this article said they had at some point been approached by suppliers and manufacturers more than willing to pad their bills for the decorator. Ms. Post, who has been in business for eight years, said she is still surprised at how often suppliers whisper, ''What do you want me to put on this bill?''</p>
        <p>''When I tell them my billing is totally open to my clients,'' she said, ''they say, 'You're so stupid!' ''</p>
        <p>An architect who requested anonymity is presently building a house that is being furnished by an interior designer. ''I know the interior designer is ripping off the client and the supplier is in on it,'' he said. The architect has not said anything to the client. ''They do good work,'' he said. He said that, once before, he notified another supplier about a $15,000 error on a bill only to have the supplier ask, implying a kickback offer, ''Whose name should go on the check?''</p>
        <p>''I've been tempted to tell the client,'' the architect said. ''But the suppliers would stop working with me because I was a tattletale. It's really rampant, a never-ending spiral.''</p>
        <p>One furniture maker, who started out in the retail business and now has a trade-only clientele, described a ruse in which he said he refused to participate. Twice, decorators have requested that he send them his bill showing a ''retail'' price, which the decorator would pay and then pass along to the client, adding his normal markup. Then the  decorator would go back to the maker and ask to be reimbursed for his usual discount -- thus being paid twice.</p>
        <p>Vendors like that furniture maker point out that there is a lot of room for adjustment on the bill's journey from supplier to client. This can lead to the case of the $1,000 throw pillow.</p>
        <p>Keller Henderson of Keller Henderson Interiors in New York tried to offer some perspective on the sometimes hair-raising prices decorators charge, particularly to their Clients From Hell. ''Let's say a client is really wringing you out,'' he said. ''You're spending a lot of time shopping for things they don't like and you're losing your shirt. Somehow, you've got to recoup your expenses.'' Suddenly a $350 pillow triples in price when it lands, like a karate chop, on the client's silk-and-linen threaded sofa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henderson said that another alternative, when clients become difficult, is ''to drop them with the paint still wet on the wall.''</p>
        <p>The absence of any visible price tags in showrooms tends to add to the lay person's sense of being left in the dark. Gregory Marshall, sales director at J. Robert Scott, a furniture showroom chain, said, ''We don't tag furniture, because it would scare the customers away.'' He noted that friends, neighbors and relatives of a designer's client will frequently call to check on prices, but ''we don't divulge any prices to anyone but the designer.''</p>
        <p>So is decorator pricing always a shell game? Clearly not. More and more designers are spelling out their fees in lengthy contracts. Few complaints get to court, despite the well-publicized legal action in which Philadelphia clients accused the New York design team of Stephen Sills and James Huniford of inflating charges for furniture and fixtures. (Mr. Huniford said yesterday that ''the issues that remain unresolved are in private arbitration.'')</p>
        <p>The American Society of Interior Designers points out that in the past three years, only 59 complaints have been lodged against its 20,000 members. (Mr. Sills and Mr. Huniford are not members.) Only 6 complaints have resulted in disciplinary action.</p>
        <p>''It's a very human business,'' said Karen Fisher, president of Design Previews, which matches clients with decorators. Mike Strohl, who represents over 30 designers in the New York area, said he often hears about clients who resort to the kind of browbeating that could drive anyone to the brink: trying to buy from vendors directly to avoid paying markups, demanding to see endless options on every bathroom fixture and refusing to pay their bills after custom work has been fully installed.</p>
        <p>Laura Bohn, a New York designer, said, only half in jest: ''I reduce my prices for people who don't make me crazy. If I don't have to show you 50 of one thing, you get a discount.''</p>
        <p>While everyone thinks that the designer is living it up at the Ritz, he or she is more likely to be beating the pavement like a well-dressed Willy Loman. ''You look for hours and hours trying to find the right thing, or maybe you spend months looking for a certain fabric that only costs you $10,'' Diana Vinoly said. ''But if you don't actually buy something, they really don't expect you to bill them for that time. In the end, they are all always shocked.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Vinoly entered the business through the tried-and-true method of designing for friends, and has yet to turn it all into a profitable business. But she has remained on good terms with her clients, once the dust settles and the Japanese bamboo shades are hung. Glitches that seem unsurmountable melt into thin air with the first sigh of awed admiration from a visitor, or the first quiet night at home sprawled on the rolled-back couch.</p>
        <p>If Tolstoy had ever had his dacha ''done,'' he might have put it this way: Happy clients are all alike. The unhappy ones you're going to hear from.</p>
