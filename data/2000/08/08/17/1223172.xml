        <p>Yasir Arafat said today that the Palestinian leadership was reassessing its plan to declare Palestinian statehood on Sept. 13.</p>
        <p>That raised the possibility that the Palestinians will not, after all, take a step that Israel has said would end all prospects for an early peace agreement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat made his remarks in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, a stop on a three-week tour of more than 20 Middle Eastern, European and Asian nations that began after the Camp David talks failed last month.</p>
        <p>After meeting with the Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid, Mr. Arafat said that the Palestinian leadership would make a decision on the statehood declaration ''at the beginning of next month,'' when the Palestine Liberation Organization's central council, a 129-member policy-making body that he effectively controls, is to meet in the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Arafat declined to say what the decision was likely to be, his remarks were in keeping with reports from Western diplomats in contact with the Palestinian leadership. They have said in recent days that Mr. Arafat is on the verge of deferring the statehood pronouncement, perhaps until November or later.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian leader hinted as much last weekend after visits to Russia and other European states, concluding that he had failed to round up international backing for an early statehood declaration.</p>
        <p>''We had decided before, but we have to reassess this,'' Mr. Arafat said today, after his meeting with Mr. Wahid at Indonesia's presidential palace.</p>
        <p>But he stopped short of stating that the declaration would definitely be deferred.</p>
        <p>He said the Palestinians had received letters from the Clinton administration and the European Union promising that in renewed talks, peace negotiators would aim at reaching a final agreement before Sept. 13, the anniversary of the 1993 Oslo accords, which began the peace process.</p>
        <p>The aim of the accords was to reach a final agreement within seven years that would settle contentious issues like Jerusalem, and seal Israeli and Palestinian recognition of each other's sovereignty and borders.</p>
        <p>Israeli newspapers have taken two views of the Palestinian maneuvering. Some contend that Mr. Arafat is retreating from the September date, bruised from the response on his travels. Others say he may privately welcome the opportunity to maneuver himself out of the commitment by citing the lack of international support.</p>
        <p>If he had gone ahead with a unilateral declaration of statehood, diplomats said, he would have risked retaliatory action by Israel that could have put the entire peace process at risk.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak has warned repeatedly that Israel will retaliate if the Palestinians pre-empt a final peace agreement by formally proclaiming a state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak and his top officials have said one likely option will be to counter the Palestinian move with the formal annexation of 145 Jewish settlements on the West Bank -- a key issue in the peace talks -- as Israeli sovereign territory.</p>
        <p>Any such sequence would most likely test to the breaking point the relative calm that has prevailed in recent times, particularly in the volatile areas around the Jewish settlements and in East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Since the Camp David negotiations collapsed last month, primarily because of disagreements over Jerusalem, Israeli and Palestinian officials have pointed to the absence of serious armed clashes as proof of the two sides' ability to work together, and to maintain an atmosphere conducive to renewed negotiations.</p>
        <p>Officials on both sides insisted again today that they would not compromise on their claims to East Jerusalem, but moves toward a resumption of full-scale peace talks continued to gather pace. For the first time since the Camp David talks, teams of senior officials from the two sides were scheduled to meet late today for what were described as substantive exchanges on Jerusalem and other issues.</p>
        <p>The Israeli team was led by Shlomo Ben-Ami, the acting foreign minister, and by Gilad Sher, an aide to Mr. Barak, and the Palestinian side by Saeb Erekat and Mohammed Dahlan, senior aides who accompanied Mr. Arafat to Camp David.</p>
        <p>Before the talks, Mr. Ben-Ami sought to dampen suggestions that Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat could meet again soon, possibly as early as mid-September. Speculation had been spurred earlier in the day by an announcement from Washington that Dennis Ross, the State Department's special peace envoy, would arrive in Israel on Thursday, several days earlier than previously announced.</p>
        <p>''We mustn't raise our expectations too high because the issues are very, very difficult,'' Mr. Ben-Ami said.</p>
        <p>The public mood ahead of the Ross talks was soured, at least temporarily, by an incident early today in which Israeli troops shot and killed a 72-year-old Palestinian man in a fusillade in Surda, a Palestinian village north of the West Bank town of Ramallah. According to Israeli and Palestinian accounts that were broadly similar, the victim, Mahmoud Abdullah, who held American citizenship, drew fire from an Israeli patrol when he shot at the soldiers with a pistol from his rooftop.</p>
        <p>He died later after the Israeli troops, fearing further attacks, kept Palestinian and Israeli medics from reaching him. Family members said the delay lasted at least an hour.</p>
        <p>Relatives, including one of his sons, Hisham, said Mr. Abdullah appeared to have gone to the roof at about 3 a.m., fearing that noises he had heard outside signaled a burglary attempt. Hisham Abdullah, who is employed as a reporter by  Agence France-Presse in Jerusalem, said his father had called out, ''Who's there?'' before apparently firing a shot into the dark. The Israelis' return fire, which left the Abdullahs' house pitted with bullet holes, struck Mahmoud Abdullah in the head.</p>
        <p>The incident dominated radio and television broadcasts in Israel and in Palestinian-controlled areas for much of the day, but did not lead to any immediate disturbances. Controversy was stirred by the Israeli decision to open fire, which was described as ''murder'' by the Palestinian communications minister, Immad Falouji. But an Israeli commander, Col. Gal Hirsch, said Israeli investigators remained unconvinced by the Abdullah brothers' account of why their father had opened fire.</p>
        <p>''We still haven't got a clue as to what induced him to act in this way,'' Colonel Hirsch said. ''But he fired, and when we're fired upon we return fire and hit.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 24, 2000, Thursday  An article on Aug. 17 about a decision by Palestinian leaders to reassess their plan to declare statehood on Sept. 13 misstated the timetable for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement under the Oslo accords of 1993. The accords spelled out a five-year interim process; they did not specify a seven-year goal for a final agreement.</p>
