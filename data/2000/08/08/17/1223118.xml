        <p>The Latin Alternative Music Conference, which presented performances and panel discussions from Saturday through Tuesday, set out to be the start of something big. About 700 musicians, recording-company executives, radio programmers, Web site operators and journalists registered for the conference, which was held at the New York Hilton and Towers. Many more people showed up to hear bands from Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Austin, Tex. And just about everyone believed that the music they love has an audience eagerly awaiting it, if only they can make contact.</p>
        <p>It will take time and strategy. There is, of course, a language barrier, though that has not stopped American and English rock from being heard worldwide. And the music barely has a foothold on American radio, where it's heard almost entirely on college or public stations. Conference participants traded other ways to get the music heard, with high hopes for satellite, cable and Internet radio. Some compared the situation to collegiate rock in the early 1980's, when bands were just finding a circuit of clubs and college gigs, and word of mouth meant survival.</p>
        <p>But that was before the spread of the Internet; with any luck, the timetable will be faster for Latin alternative music.</p>
        <p>Outside the United States, the music faces the barriers of national taste. Yet music video has bound Latin America together. And Molotov -- a group of raucous, punk-rooted rappers who sometimes tilt back toward Mexican rhythms -- has sold a million albums worldwide, nearly a quarter of them in Spain. Molotov headlines the Watcha Tour, a package of raucous rock en espanol bands, which comes to the Tunnel in Chelsea on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Conference participants cited promising demographics, particularly the growing number of Americans -- both immigrants and native-born -- who speak Spanish and have a stake in more than one culture. (Los Angeles County, which includes the factory town of American entertainment, is projected to have a Hispanic majority within the decade.) Whatever their roots, they've also been bombarded by American pop, and there's no reason not to enjoy whatever they want. Young Latinos and Latinas are bilingual and used to crossing cultural borders; they don't have to shut anything out. And as they casually juggle multiple idioms, they show how to thrive in a globally networked 21st century.</p>
        <p>''There's so much information that goes by,'' said Julieta Venegas, a songwriter who grew up in Tijuana, Mexico, and is about to release her second album. ''Naturally you learn to use it.'' Ms. Venegas is completely fluent in English, which she learned from California television, but she writes in Spanish because, she says, ''I don't really feel things in English, and I don't want to fake it.'' She sometimes plays a small Mexican accordion in her songs, but she got the idea, she says, from hearing Joe Jackson and Tom Waits. And her songs have the clear melodies and emotional impact that could make listeners sing along before they worry about the words.</p>
        <p>At the conference, no one tried to pin down a definition of alternative. It is, in practice, music that's not heard on commercial Spanish-language radio stations, which tend to play salsa, sentimental Latin pop or established regional genres like Mexican banda or Dominican bachata. Latin alternative tends to be format-busting music. A band like Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas, from Argentina, is fully capable of using rapping, rock guitars, Afro-Caribbean percussion and lounge-funk interludes all in the same song, while the lyrics leap from personal confession to social comment to surreal humor.</p>
        <p>The music already has a long pedigree. In Brazil in the late 1960's, rebellious rockers created tropicalia, embracing a giddy modernity without forgetting homegrown traditions. Rock also got footholds in Mexico, in Argentina and across Latin America, where multinational marketing met a receptive public. In many places, bands started out imitating foreign rockers while writing lyrics in Spanish; gradually, however, local idioms peeked through.</p>
        <p>By now, the category rock en espanol has become far too confining to hold music that stretches from Ms. Venegas's intimate pop songs to the introspective rock of Aterciopelados to the funk of Los Amigos Invisibles to the electronica of Nortec.</p>
        <p>The bands that performed during the conference rebounded Anglo rock with their own warps and twists. Even when they dressed like punks, band members were proficient musicians; they have to be to slip in and out of multiple styles. A few, like La Ley -- one of Chile's top bands -- simply imitated pompous 80's rock that sounds shopworn here. But Vallejo, a band from Austin that has songs in English and Spanish, found a way to merge rap-metal with Southern rock, Texas boogie and Caribbean rhythms.</p>
        <p>And Nortec, an electronica collective from Tijuana, calmly bounced electronica across borders. The band's name comes from norteno, the Mexican label for Tex-Mex music, and techno, and at Irving Plaza on Tuesday night, the group projected videos and slides with images of accordions, banditos and a digitalized cactus.</p>
        <p>Its disc jockey-programmers built their music from cold electronic tones that harked back to Kraftwerk, but also from the sounds of the drums and cowbells in Mexican cumbia bands; one segment took the beat of a norteno waltz and distorted it into a techno chomp. It was recognizably local and internationally up-to-date, and it was irresistible.</p>
