        <p>An underfunded team of working-class Latino 11- and 12-year-olds from the East Tremont section of the Bronx will play baseball here Thursday night against a team from the suburbs of Manchester, N.H., for the right to go to the Little League World Series next week.</p>

        <p>An underfunded team of working-class Latino 11- and 12-year-olds from the East Tremont section of the Bronx will play baseball here Thursday night against a team from the suburbs of Manchester, N.H., for the right to go to the Little League World Series next week.</p>
        <p>The game marks the first time a team from the Bronx's hardscrabble streets has made it this far in the annual Little League tournament. The last time a team from New York City won the Eastern Regional Championships and went on to the World Series was in 1991 when Staten Island did it.</p>
        <p>The Bronx team has made the regional finals even though its league was formed just four years ago and the team lacks a home field and money for equipment.</p>
        <p>Still, the all-star team from the Rolando Paulino Little League has dazzled opponents with solid fielding and clutch hitting, going 4-1 against other state champions in a round-robin tournament and then rolling over Pequannock, N.J., on Tuesday night, 6-3, to gain the regional finals, where it will face a seasoned all-star team from Goffstown, N.H.</p>
        <p>Though the Bronx team's strong showing this year has surprised some opponents, it came as no surprise to the coach, Alberto Gonzalez, a 31-year-old waiter who played as a teenager for the Dominican Republic's junior national team. The Bronx team is drawn, he said, from Dominican and Puerto Rican families, people for whom baseball is not only a passion, but also a potential ticket to a college scholarship or, in rare cases, to fame and fortune in the major leagues.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of talent over there,'' Gonzalez said today of the Hispanic Bronx. ''But nobody put it together before.''</p>
        <p>The Goffstown team has a core of athletes who have played together for several years. About five years ago, the town's Little League organization revamped its training regimen and made a commitment to send a team to the Little League World Series. The team has speed on the bases and no glaring weaknesses in its lineup.</p>
        <p>''We were on a mission for the last five years to get to where we are,'' said the Goffstown coach, Frank Szumiesz, a maintenance supervisor for the U.S. Postal Service.</p>
        <p>After a night of torrential rain, the practice fields here at the A. Bartlett Giamatti Little League Leadership Training Center were too wet for practice today.</p>
        <p>Instead, the boys from the two teams spent the morning playing table tennis, watching movies and swimming at the center's campus, where they have been staying in dormitories. The players, all 11 and 12 years old, were taken this afternoon to the nearby Lake Compounce Amusement Park.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere at the training center was cordial, with players from both teams fraternizing and getting to know each other.</p>
        <p>Gonzalez said his team has better defense and pitching than last year's team, which also won the New York State championship, but lost in a quarterfinal game of the regional tournament. Five players from last year's team have returned this year.</p>
        <p>But this year's team also boasts a new pitching ace: Juan Adorno, a 12-year-old right hander who pitched a perfect game in the first round of the tournament. The 14 players on the squad were chosen from 36 top players in the 11-to-12-year-old division of the league, which was founded by Rolando Paulino, the baseball writer for the Spanish-language newspaper Noticias Del Mundo.</p>
        <p>If the Bronx players prevail on Thursday night, they would leave Friday morning for Williamsport, Pa., to play in the Little League World Series. There they would face the southern regional champs from Bellaire, Tex., on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>Perhaps then, Gonzalez said, someone in New York might help the league with equipment and uniforms. The New York Yankees promised support last year, he said, but did not deliver. Modell's Sporting Goods then donated uniforms for last year's all-star team, but did make a similar donation this year.</p>
        <p>''We have to bring our names up so we can get some help with the league, and the dream of having our own field,'' Gonzalez said. ''These kids are smart and they deserve a chance.''</p>
