      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman continued his efforts today to win the full support of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party as one of its prominent members, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, went before the New York delegation to praise the historic alliance between Jews and blacks.</p>
        <p>Against a backdrop of low-level grumbling by members of the party's traditional base about the Democrats' centrist ticket and platform, Mr. Lieberman visited in quick succession with leaders of three important constituency groups -- gays and lesbians, Hispanics and Asian Pacific Islanders.</p>
        <p>And at nearly the same time, Mr. Jackson told New York delegates that Vice President Al Gore's selection of Mr. Lieberman as his running mate was a bold expression of affirmative action.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, he said, ''broke the quota of zero to make sure an American Jew would be on the ticket.''</p>
        <p>''That's what affirmative action is,'' he added. ''It breaks the barriers of exclusion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson appeared as delegates here were buzzing about an editorial in The Amsterdam News, the major black newspaper in New York City, suggesting that Mr. Gore had selected Mr. Lieberman as a way of currying favor from Jewish contributors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson made no direct mention of the editorial, and his advisers  said that discussion of relations between Jews and blacks was not in response to it. Nonetheless, Mr. Jackson's affirmation of relations between blacks and Jews over the past 20 years drew a long and loud standing ovation from delegates.</p>
        <p>In a news conference, Mr. Jackson said that he did not share the view of the newspaper's publisher, Wilbert Tatum, but he declined, in response to repeated questioning, to condemn Mr. Tatum's views. ''Any language that would threaten our unity is not helpful,'' Mr. Jackson said, ''but in a free speech society we cannot stop people from talking, whether you agree or disagree.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson's remarks, and Mr. Lieberman's efforts to reach out to members of minority groups, underscored complicated dynamics within the Democratic Party that have slowly surfaced in the weeks since Mr. Lieberman's selection. It has exposed tensions between the liberal and centrist wings of the party, as well as between blacks and Jews. Mr. Lieberman, while proudly emphasizing his heritage, said today that he hoped people would vote for him because of his qualifications, not because of his religion.</p>
        <p>''We're asking people to forget about the history,'' he said.</p>
        <p>During Mr. Lieberman's round of caucus visits, he wooed members with old-fashioned political appeals, reminding them of votes he has made in support of their pet causes, promising future support. But he also sought to establish a more personal connection by repeatedly linking his heritage as an Orthodox Jew with the cultural resistance that members of all minority groups have faced throughout the country's history.</p>
        <p>''I must say,'' he told the Asian Pacific Islanders caucus of the Democratic National Committee, ''that when I look out on this room I see the faces of my grandparents and my parents, and I see the story of America. What a remarkable turn of events to find Al Gore to have had the courage to break the barrier he did by picking me.</p>
        <p>''The fact is,'' he added, ''that once barriers fall for one group, the doors of opportunity open wider for all Americans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's appearances today extended a highly public fence-mending campaign that he began on Tuesday when he met with the black caucus. Mr. Lieberman, a leading member of the centrist New Democrats, has faced questions from liberal Democrats about his criticism of some affirmative action programs and his support of experimental programs to give school vouchers to children in low-income neighborhoods. On Tuesday he reassured the black caucus that he would support affirmative action, and today he spoke to all three groups about the need for equal opportunities.</p>
        <p>''That's the promise of America,'' he said. ''We're not looking for a guaranteed outcome. Just give us a guaranteed opportunity and we'll work hard enough to earn the outcome.''</p>
        <p>Throughout the caucus visits, Mr. Lieberman displayed a relaxed, self-effacing manner. When he was introduced to the Hispanic caucus, he joked about opening a kosher-Latino restaurant with such fanciful dishes as ''gefilta fish serviche.''</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Lieberman was anxious to solidify his relationships with these groups, they, too, seemed ready to embrace the Gore-Lieberman ticket. He received enthusiastic receptions from all three caucuses. Members of the Asian group stood and chanted ''We want Joe.'' During his meeting with the gay and lesbian caucus, a man yelled ''We love you, Joe.'' The Hispanic caucus cheered him wildly and some members held up signs that read, "Viva Gore-Lieberman.''</p>
        <p>''I could get used to this,'' Mr. Lieberman joked.</p>
        <p>In recent days, Mr. Lieberman has pledged not to engage in harsh, partisan attacks against the Republican Party, and today he largely abided by that promise. He barely mentioned the Republican nominees, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. ''Some of my best friends are Republicans,'' he quipped at one point.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, he took a few shots. Republican policies, he said more than once today, would only ''squander'' the current prosperity, and he ridiculed the G.O.P. itself as ''the same old crowd'' -- intolerant, white, rich and unrepresentative of America's diversity.</p>
        <p>''They worked hard to create an appearance of inclusiveness on the platform in Philadelphia a couple of weeks ago,'' he said. ''But at this convention, the inclusiveness and diversity are on the floor.''</p>
        <p>In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Lieberman said that part of his job as a running mate included reintroducing Mr. Gore to the electorate. Today, he worked hard at fulfilling that role. He described their 12-year friendship, and recalled how they have often talked, argued and prayed together. ''I love this man,'' he told the Hispanic caucus.</p>
        <p>''I believe in Al Gore,'' he told the Asian caucus.</p>
        <p>Again and again, he described his selection as a window into Mr. Gore's values and character. ''Al Gore said more about himself, his trust in the American people, than he did about me.''</p>
