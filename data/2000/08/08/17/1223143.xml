        <p>A homeless man arrested in a series of sexual assaults on the Upper East Side has confessed to eight attacks on women in the last 11 weeks, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The man, Ishmael Holmes, 22, who was arrested Monday night, acknowledged that he had followed eight women into their buildings between 86th and 96th Streets, threatened them and touched them, then demanded money, according to police reports.</p>
        <p>All the attacks took place during the day. They have frightened women in a neighborhood that has suffered a wave of sex attacks despite a falling crime rate.</p>
        <p>In April, the police arrested another man and charged him with several rapes in the area. And the police are still searching for a man they call the East Side rapist, who they believe committed 16 rapes from 1994 to 1998.</p>
        <p>In the eight incidents since May 30, Mr. Holmes followed women through the streets and into their buildings, where he would demand oral sex and money, and would usually flee if the women screamed, investigators said. In one case, on July 27 at 12:40 p.m., he followed a woman into her building on East 93rd Street. In the hallway, he touched her breasts and forced her to have oral sex, then stole her wallet and fled, officials said.</p>
        <p>He also admitted to one reported incident in which he followed a woman through the streets. He did not approach her, however.</p>
        <p>He was caught shortly after the eighth attack on Monday, when he entered a building at East 87th Street and told a woman there to put her hands against the wall so he could ''check her,'' according to a police report.</p>
        <p>Officials say that he then demanded her wallet but fled, and the incident was reported to police as an attempted robbery. Armed with a description of Mr. Holmes, the police picked him up on 94th Street, and several victims identified him in a lineup. He was living in a homeless shelter on Wards Island at the time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holmes has a history of brushes with the law. He was arrested in 1997 for sexual assault and in 1998 for public lewdness, according to police records.</p>
        <p>In October 1999, he was arrested for two sex-related incidents in the Bronx and reached a plea agreement with prosecutors to serve six months in jail and four and a half years on  probation. He was released in early May on the condition that he attend a sex offender's program and appear regularly before a judge.</p>
        <p>Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney, did not know Tuesday if Mr. Holmes had begun attending the therapy, but said he had appeared before the judge at least twice since his release.</p>
