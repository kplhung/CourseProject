        <p>City Zip zipped to the head of the class of 2-year-old colts in the East today when he won the Saratoga Special for his third straight stakes victory and his second in three weeks.</p>
        <p>The colt, a son of Carson City trained by Linda Rice and ridden by Jose Santos, won the first in the series of three Saratoga stakes for juveniles when he rushed through the homestretch on July 27 to nail Yonaguska in the Sanford, with Scorpion third.</p>
        <p>And on a track that finally was rated fast after a mostly rainy season, he rushed through the stretch today and nailed Scorpion by two and a quarter lengths, with Standard Speed third.</p>
        <p>He was actually being pointed toward the Hopeful on Sept. 2, but Rice decided that her horse was ready to run now. The last time a horse won the three stakes for juveniles at Saratoga was in 1993 when Dehere did it and went on to become the juvenile champion.</p>
        <p>''We knew after the Sanford that we were going to point for the Hopeful,'' Rice said. ''But he came out of that race in terrific shape and breezed on Saturday and, after that, we decided to take a look at this race and run here. Again, the Hopeful is still a big goal for us.''</p>
        <p>City Zip has won four of his seven starts and has run in the money in all seven, which is a tour de force of stamina for a 2-year-old horse these days. He ran the six and a half furlongs of the Saratoga Special in 1:164/5 , returned $3.50 for $2 to win, $2.30 to place and $2.20 to show as the heavy favorite and added $90,000 to his bankroll, which has already reached $300,000.</p>
        <p>Scorpion returned $3 and $2.60, and Standard Speed paid $5.20 to show in the eight-horse field.</p>
        <p>D. Wayne Lukas, who trains Scorpion, said that his colt ''ran well again'' and added: ''The more ground this horse gets, the better he will get.''</p>
