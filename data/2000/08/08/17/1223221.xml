        <p>The world leader in the diamond business, De Beers, said its earnings more than tripled in the first half of the year, to $877 million, on a 44 percent surge in sales to a record $3.4 billion. The sales helped reduce the company's stockpile of diamonds, which it had historically used to control prices, by nearly one-third this year, to $2.7 billion. De Beers hopes to charge a premium for its diamonds in exchange for a guarantee that they are not ''blood diamonds,'' stones sold to finance African wars.</p>
