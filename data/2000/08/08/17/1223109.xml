        <p>I DON'T know much about gardening,'' said Brenda Blethyn, the British actress, who was in Manhattan this month for the opening of a new film.</p>
        <p>It was an evasive move, meant to prevent anyone at the Chelsea Garden Center from pulling a pop quiz on her.

        <p>I DON'T know much about gardening,'' said Brenda Blethyn, the British actress, who was in Manhattan this month for the opening of a new film.</p>
        <p>It was an evasive move, meant to prevent anyone at the Chelsea Garden Center from pulling a pop quiz on her. But in fact Ms. Blethyn knows enough about gardening to toss out plant names like Harry Lauder's walking stick and to refer to the garden behind her Georgian home in South London as ''planted mostly in evergreens and perennials.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, people in Britain have thought of her as a gardener ever since she was quoted saying she ''loved the garden'' -- around the time she was nominated for an Academy Award for her starring role in the 1997 film ''Secrets &amp; Lies.''</p>
        <p>''What I meant was that I loved to take a cup of coffee out to the garden and sit there and read,'' she said. ''But that's where it started, the idea that I was a real gardener. Now, I'm invited on all sorts of gardening programs.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Blethyn talks like a lot of weekend gardeners. She refers to Buddleia as ''that tall, purply, like a lilac but later in the year'' bush. Self-taught, she picked up plant names from her mother and learns as she  goes. ''It started with keeping things tidy,'' she said. ''And then you get interested and start to nourish it.''</p>
        <p>She's not beyond eccentric touches, either. ''When the cottonwoods blow all that fluff into the garden in the spring, I go out into the garden with a Hoover,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In the new film ''Saving Grace,'' she gets to play a woman who has a touch with plants, a staid widow who takes up growing and selling pot so she can keep her manor house. ''Some of the pot plants are real,'' she offered. ''But they had the potency taken out of them. They were supplied by the Home Office.''</p>
        <p>Her garden in London presents a particular challenge because it lies up a steep hillside. ''There are 42 stone steps up to the top,'' she said. ''And there's a plateau on the top, where I want it to stay wild.'' That is, except for a half-ton urn she plans to have hoisted up there.</p>
        <p>She keeps a small pond in front of her house as well. ''It's quite naff, really,'' she said, using British slang for something underpowered. ''It's got a few fish in it, big, common gold fish, and every once in a while a bird will swoop down and spike one.'' The pond is planted with lilies, bamboo and forget-me-nots.</p>
        <p>Smell is so important to her that she bans geraniums and plants a lot of lavender and hyacinth. And she keeps a decent size herb garden near the patio, loaded with basil.</p>
        <p>But she regrets what she has done recently to her wisteria, pruning it back hard. ''I killed it,'' she said. ''I don't know if it will ever come back.''</p>
        <p>But as all gardeners know, nothing can possibly keep a wisteria down forever.</p>
