        <p>Spike Jonze, the 29-year-old director of ''Being John Malkovich'' and one of the coolest filmmakers in Hollywood, picked up the phone several weeks ago and got what he called one of the biggest surprises of his life. The Gore campaign asked him to fly to Nashville and hang out with Vice President Al Gore and his family,  and then make a movie about the Gores for the campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, whose supporters include such directors as Steven Spielberg, Sydney Pollack and Rob Reiner, could have probably called on any filmmaker in Hollywood. But one of Mr. Gore's favorite films in recent years is ''Being John Malkovich,'' which was praised by critics as one of the most original and offbeat movies in years.</p>
        <p>Written by Charlie Kaufman, the movie is about a struggling puppeteer who finds a portal to the brain of actor John Malkovich (played by the actor). As a result, people line up to be inside his head. The movie is about the culture's obsession with fame; Mr. Jonze has been one of the most successful directors of music videos and commercials in the last few years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jonze, whose real name is Adam Spiegel, and who is heir to the Spiegel clothing catalog fortune, said that he just completed editing the campaign film on Tuesday night. ''I was definitely surprised when they called,'' he said. ''They asked me if there were any ideas I had of the things I'd want to do. The idea was for me to see what he really was like. I went to meet him. I brought my little video camera. No crew. Just me and my camera.''</p>
        <p>The film has jagged MTV-style editing. It is an affectionate portrait of a relaxed and laughing Mr. Gore at his family's farm, at the dinner table with his wife and daughters, deciding what film to watch on video, swimming in heavy surf at the beach and riding on a military helicopter. In the film, Mr. Gore joked on Air Force Two about his reputation as an uptight politician, pointing to his  wife, Tipper, who is barefoot. ''She insists on going barefoot -- it completely messes up my image,'' he said. Tipper Gore cheerfully replied: ''That's my job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore even kidded about his role as vice president. ''The guy standing motionless on stage behind the president -- what the hell makes him think he can be president?'' Mr. Gore joked at one point.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jonze indicated that he never cared too much about politics -- until now. ''It was incredibly interesting to be around all that,'' he said. ''I liked him a lot. I had a fun day.''</p>
        <p>Hard Words on Soft Money</p>
        <p>There's nothing like watching two billionaires in a cat fight over money. The bad blood between the entertainment mogul David Geffen and Eli Broad, the Los Angeles civic and financial leader, continues. At a lunch Mr. Geffen served on Tuesday at his 9-acre, 15,000-square-foot French chateau-style home in Beverly Hills -- which he bought for $47.5 million in 1990 -- the mogul told assorted movie and media stars that he was happy to have one of the few parties here that didn't require a six-figure check for admission.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Geffen has been the object of open criticism about not writing a big check himself. The criticism has come from Mr. Broad, who with Mr. Geffen was one of the co-chairmen of the committee that lured the Democrats to Los Angeles. Mr. Broad, who has even more billions than Mr. Geffen, has said that Mr. Geffen backed out of his commitments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Geffen doesn't speak publicly of Mr. Broad. But someone close to Mr. Geffen said he had given millions to the Democratic Party and was not going to be ''intimidated'' by Mr. Broad into ''underwriting the Democratic convention,'' which he said had been made clear from ''Day 1.''</p>
        <p>War Stories</p>
        <p>Vietnam. Thirty years ago the Democratic Party tried to forget the war that began in the administration of John F. Kennedy and reached its peak in the Lyndon B. Johnson years. But the convention here is raising the Vietnam issue -- specifically who served there, and who didn't -- in an effort to contrast Vice President Gore, who served near Saigon, with his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, two Democratic senators and combat veterans wounded in Vietnam, Senator Max Cleland of Georgia and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, were given prominent speaking roles. Tonight, several Vietnam veterans will introduce Mr. Gore, who served in the military for two years and in Vietnam as an Army reporter. By contrast, Mr. Bush served in the Air National Guard and was not called to Vietnam. Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, used deferments to avoid being drafted. And Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, also used deferments first as a student and later as a parent. Mr. Lieberman has said that he has ''felt some remorse'' about not serving.</p>
        <p>Who Needs Bunnies?</p>
        <p>Even without the Playboy mansion, Representative Loretta Sanchez's fund-raising bash for Hispanic lawmakers was hopping on Tuesday night. Ms. Sanchez, a California Democrat, had been pressured by party leaders to drop the Playboy Mansion as the spot for her blast, even though Mr. Gore himself has accepted money from Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy. The Democratic National Committee feared the Playboy party would be a public relations debacle and run counter to the Democrats' attempts to portray themselves as the party of family values.</p>
        <p>In the end, the party seemed most of all a huge public relations coup for Ms. Sanchez, who held forth in a plunging black gown and upswept hair as a hundred reporters and television crews recorded her every word at B. B. King's Blues Club at Universal Studio's City Walk, the new site of the party. ''Al Gore has accepted money from Playboy,'' Ms. Sanchez said pointedly. ''And he would have to give you his reasons as to what he's done with that money and where it goes and why he takes it.''</p>
