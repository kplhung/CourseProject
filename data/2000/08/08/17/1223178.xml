        <p>Five months after dropping out of the Democratic race for the presidency, Bill Bradley has been asked if he wants to be chairman of the United States Olympic Committee.</p>
        <p>Norm Blake, the U.S.O.C.'s chief executive, said yesterday that he had spoken by telephone with Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, three or four weeks ago at the request of the organization's nominating committee.</p>
        <p>''I think he was seriously considering it, and I was very impressed with how he conducted himself,'' Blake said. ''He wanted to be sure it wasn't a figurehead position, and wanted a job where he could make a difference.'' Bradley, a former Knicks player, gave no decision and Blake was awaiting Bradley's response to a tentative date for a meeting.</p>
        <p>Bradley, who spoke Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention, played for the 1964 United States Olympic basketball team.</p>
        <p>Anita Dunn, a spokeswoman for Bradley, said, ''He is considering a number of options, but he's not commenting on any specific conversations that he's having with anyone.''</p>
        <p>The U.S.O.C.'s nominating committee is expected to recommend a slate of officers, including chairman, by Sept. 1. The U.S.O.C.'s board of directors will vote in December.</p>
        <p>Despite his direct contact with Bradley, Blake said, ''I will embrace whomever the nominating committee recommends.''</p>
        <p>The U.S.O.C. reorganized last year under a corporate model by creating a more powerful C.E.O. position out of the former executive director's job, and turning the formerly volunteer president's job, now held by Bill Hybl, into the chairman.</p>
        <p>The chairman, who is not paid, would have broad international responsibilities and a significant role in Washington. Steve Richards, chief of the nominating committee, confirmed that ''as part of the process of looking at a variety of candidates,'' Bradley was contacted.</p>
        <p>Richard declined to say whether Bradley was the only outsider being considered for chairman. Paul George and Sandy Baldwin, two U.S.O.C. vice presidents, are being considered. Also, Sandy Knapp, of USA Gymnastics, said yesterday, ''I'm in the candidate pool.''</p>
