        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was appalled at the underlying assumptions in ''Choosing Quick Hits Over the Card Catalog'' (Aug. 10), about how the Internet has affected students' research strategies. The assumption that libraries collect only paper materials betrays a lack of research. Although card catalogs still exist, most university-level libraries have switched to computerized catalogs, which are available remotely. So students can find out the status of a book without having to go to the library. And both public and academic libraries collect electronic materials, like CD-ROM's and databases, and electronic versions of  journals and indexes.By propagating the myths of paper-bound libraries and quaint librarians, you have done a disservice to your readers.</p>
