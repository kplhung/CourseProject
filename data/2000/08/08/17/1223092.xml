        <p>ALTHOUGH I do not wear makeup, I live with two experts on the subject. My 9- and 11-year-old daughters are so attuned to the nuances of cosmetics that they can tell from a distance of 20 paces if a woman gels her eyebrows.</p>

        <p>ALTHOUGH I do not wear makeup, I live with two experts on the subject. My 9- and 11-year-old daughters are so attuned to the nuances of cosmetics that they can tell from a distance of 20 paces if a woman gels her eyebrows.</p>
        <p>''What does that level of eyebrow maintenance accomplish?'' I asked, a question that unfortunately focused their attention directly on my own unplucked visage one day last week.</p>
        <p>Within an hour, I was at the mall, sitting on one of those high stools while my daughters applied blush and eye shadow from tester pots in a quest to determine my ''colors.''</p>
        <p>I had to admit that it was a lot of fun, until a sales clerk approached offering cleanser on a cotton ball and a free consultation.</p>
        <p>One thing led to another, and I lost control of the situation around the time the clerk announced that I had ''ragged, uneven patches'' and ''fatty deposits'' that cried out for daily applications of expensive creams.</p>
        <p>By the time I regained my composure in the parking lot 15 minutes later, my face had been replaced by the clerk's idea of ''a sheer look for everyday,'' and I was clutching a shopping bag full of makeup. The receipt said $122.</p>
        <p>''You look good,'' lied Zoe, my 11-year-old.</p>
        <p>You might think the humiliation of slinking back to return the stuff the next day (actually, to avoid the clerk I skulked to another Bloomingdale's in a different town) would have jettisoned further experimentation. But it only whetted my appetite: I had seen my future and it included eyeliner.</p>
        <p>So when I heard about a growing number of Internet sites where shoppers can perform virtual makeovers on themselves, I rushed over to test three, eMakeover.com, MakeoverStudio.com and EZface.com.</p>
        <p>The idea is that you take a digital photo of your face, send it to the site  and then point and click on different combinations of products to apply them to the image. You can then see what goes together and buy products you want online.</p>
        <p>I tried blond hair (a mistake) at eMakeover and yellow eye shadow (ditto) at EZface. Then I clicked a button to clean it all off. I could determine my colors without enduring a sales clerk's sales pitch.</p>
        <p>The sites are still in development. Shoppers can purchase a limited selection of beauty products at two of them, eMakeover.com and MakeoverStudio.com.</p>
        <p>Next month, the EZface makeover tool (which is being tested, so you can play with it but not purchase anything) will be available at a jewelry site, Kirabo.com, where shoppers will be able to click on earrings and necklaces to see how the gems look on them.</p>
        <p>That was so much fun that I thought I might be witnessing the emergence of tools that would magically erase at least one of the problems that have plagued the crowded online cosmetics market in recent months and prompted mergers and buyouts of such high-profile sites as Beauty.com and Gloss.com.</p>
        <p>''The contenders in this market have been like pigeons scraping for bread crumbs in a crowded piazza,'' said Evie Black Dykema, a senior online retail analyst at Forrester Research.</p>
        <p>Even with a projected increase in Web sales, to $900 million by 2004 from $90 million last year, only 2 percent of non-medication health and beauty aids will be sold online, Ms. Dykema said.</p>
        <p>Many shoppers are reluctant to buy makeup they cannot test before buying. ''To see how something looks truly on your own face, and how it's blended with your own skin tone and your hairstyle and the color of your eyes, is a major breakthrough,'' said Gary Savage, EZface.com's chief executive.</p>
        <p>The biggest hurdle? Getting the digital photo online. Only 8 percent of households in the United States have a digital camera or a scanner so the makeover tools' distribution is limited. (There are other options. You can take a regular roll of film to a Kodak PhotoNet outlet and then get access to the digitized photos through AOL's ''You've Got Pictures'' service or take a printed photo to a print shop to have it put onto a disk.)</p>
        <p>Even for a person like me, living in a household with at least a half-dozen digital cameras lying around and a spouse who knows how to use them, the project was an ordeal.</p>
        <p>I had to sit around playing solitaire on the computer for nearly two hours as my husband fiddled with lighting, hunted for the camera cord, persuaded his computer to recognize a smart card reader, persuaded the smart card reader to recognize the digital image, fiddled with the editing software to create a JPEG file and transferred the image from his computer to mine via a home network.</p>
        <p>Frankly, I was exhausted.</p>
        <p>I then had to send the image via e-mail to both EZface.com and MakeoverStudio.com so their software could reproduce my features and my skin tone to ensure a realistic application of makeup.</p>
        <p>I had to wait for the photos to be processed. At EZface.com, that took a couple of days, but at MakeoverStudio.com, my photo was still ''in process'' after six days (so I tested that site's makeover tool on digital images of models on the site).</p>
        <p>I also uploaded my digital image to eMakeover.com, which took only a few minutes. The problem there, however, was that I had to use the cursor to mark outlines of my own features on the digital image so the site would know where to apply color. In the end, my lips looked kind of crooked.</p>
        <p>Emakeover.com offered dozens of choices of lipstick colors from Avon to test. I saved the ones I liked -- twig, rose marble and shell -- in an online shopping basket. Afterward, eMakeover.com connected me to Avon.com's site to complete the purchase.</p>
        <p>Transmitting color over the Internet to shoppers with idiosyncratic computer systems running various operating systems and different browsers is a tricky business.</p>
        <p>''The colors are monitor-dependent, but, over all, monitors are getting better and better,'' said Chrissie Kremer, a co-founder of Makeover Networks, which owns MakeoverStudio.com. ''People with modern-day equipment are getting really good representation.''</p>
        <p>I had been considering the Avon lipstick rose marble, which seemed to really bring out my eyes, when Ella, my 9-year-old, peered over my shoulder at the computer screen.</p>
        <p>''You know something?'' she said. ''You look really good without makeup.''</p>
