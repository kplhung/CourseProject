        <p>A calf decamped from a slaughterhouse in Queens yesterday morning and loped briskly down city streets, pursued by police cars, before being captured in a playground nearly 20 blocks away.</p>
        <p>At 11 a.m., the animal escaped from Astoria Live Poultry at 31-37 20th Avenue, the police said. The business is a meat market that keeps livestock and allows customers to choose the animals they want butchered.</p>
        <p>Though the calf circumvented the dining table for now, it did not avoid the indignity of being shot with tranquilizer darts and shoveled into a horse trailer with a forklift.</p>
        <p>The calf's excursion ended in a playground on 23rd Avenue and Steinway Street, where police officers lassoed it and sedated it. It was then taken to the animal port at Kennedy International Airport, the only berth that could be found for such a large animal, until the authorities could decide what to do with it.</p>
        <p>The city's animal shelters are not equipped for anything bigger than a large dog, said Doris Meyer, a spokeswoman for the Center for Animal Care and Control, the agency that handles strays.</p>
        <p>Escaped cattle appear to be a recurring problem in western Queens. Last summer, a 1,700-pound bull escaped from an illegal rodeo in Long Island City and charged several people. The police shot it dead.  The calf, however, did not appear to have a violent agenda. No one was hurt, and no property was damaged.</p>
        <p>Astoria Live Poultry was cited for failure to secure the animal, the police said. The police did not know how the animal had escaped, and a man who answered the phone at the company refused to comment.</p>
        <p>Ms. Meyer said her agency had yet to hear from the company, so she did not know if it wanted it back. If not, she said, ''there are several organizations that are willing to accept this animal so it won't become somebody's hamburger.'' She did not have specifics, but said, ''It's going to live a happy life for a cow, whatever makes a cow happy.''</p>
