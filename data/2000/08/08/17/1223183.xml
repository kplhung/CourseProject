        <p>A fourth day of street protests, this time against corruption and brutality in the Los Angeles Police Department itself, proceeded in relative calm today, with a few thousand demonstrators chanting slogans like ''L.A.P.D., you can't hide, we charge you with genocide'' as ranks of officers looked on impassively.</p>
        <p>The day began with a march to the department's Rampart Division station house, where 37 demonstrators were arrested after they sat down and blocked the entrance to building. Rampart is the division involved in the city's worst corruption scandal in a decade; more than 20 officers have been implicated in fabricating evidence and framing innocent suspects.</p>
        <p>A crowd of demonstrators later moved from police headquarters near City Hall to the Staples Center, where the Democratic National Convention is meeting.</p>
        <p>As the protesters neared the center, some blocked the intersection, resulting in a minor clash with the police. Some demonstrators tossed bottles, while officers used batons to force the crowd back.</p>
        <p>In all, nearly 200 protesters have been arrested, most of them on misdemeanor charges, since the demonstrations began on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Adam Eidinger of the Midnight Special Law Collective, a legal support group for protesters, said perhaps 40 percent of the people arrested were declining to give their names, hoping to bargain for reduced charges, a tactic that protesters also employed in Philadelphia two weeks ago at the Republican National Convention.</p>
        <p>Despite temperatures in the 90's and unusually high humidity, the crowds and the police largely remained cool. This week of protests has proved to be just the latest challenge for a police department already under fire on several fronts.</p>
        <p>Judges have dismissed 100 cases in which evidence was tainted in the Rampart investigation, and in a separate investigation, the Justice Department has accused the police of systemic misconduct and threatened a federal civil rights lawsuit if the city does not agree to changes in police training and discipline.</p>
        <p>As police officers videotaped them, protesters carried signs, including one reading ''To Serve and Protect Rich White People,'' a mocking twist on the police department's proud slogan, ''To Serve and Protect.'' The protesters demanded an independent civilian investigation into the Rampart accusations.</p>
        <p>Separately, the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said it would file a civil lawsuit in federal court accusing the police of harassing journalists and firing rubber bullets at at least one freelance photographer during a confrontation after some protesters turned rowdy and violent at the end of a rock concert outside the Staples Center on Monday night.</p>
        <p>''The dangers here, both physical and constitutional, are grave,'' said Ramona Ripston, the group's executive director.</p>
        <p>But police commanders again strongly defended their response to the demonstrators as measured and appropriate.</p>
        <p>In a briefing this morning, the department's spokesman, Commander David Kalish, showed photographs of cans of lighter fluid, aerosol sprays, plastic Easter eggs filled with gasoline and other makeshift incendiary devices that he said officers had confiscated from about 45 demonstrators who were protesting the fur trade and banging on a window at a downtown store on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Democrats' convention committee, expressed satisfaction at the police performance.</p>
        <p>''It's been fine,'' Mr. McAuliffe said. ''L.A.'s put on a great show.''</p>
        <p>THE DEMOCRATS: THE DEMONSTRATIONS  Correction:  August 18, 2000, Friday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about protests against the Los Angeles Police Department referred incorrectly to the recent corruption disclosures about the department's Rampart Division, where more than 20 officers have been implicated in the fabrication of evidence and the framing of suspects. The episode is the city's worst corruption scandal in decades, not merely in a decade.</p>
