        <p>Albert Arnold Gore Jr., who steadfastly served as vice president through an often tumultuous eight years, was nominated for president tonight after his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, introduced himself to America with a forceful appeal on behalf of Mr. Gore and a muted rebuke of Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, whose selection as Mr. Gore's running mate made him the first Jew on a major party ticket, delivered a personal testament to the vice president, saying they were so close that they prayed together.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore is a man of courage and conviction,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''He believes in service to America. He volunteered for Vietnam. Together, we crossed party lines to support the Gulf war. I was there in the room when I heard him forcefully argue that America's principles and interests were at stake in Bosnia and Kosovo. That wasn't easy. He had the guts to do it.'' [Excerpts, Page A26.]</p>
        <p>In the ceremonial, but joyous, roll-call of states to ratify Mr. Gore's nomination, Florida put him over the top just before midnight E.D.T., surpassing the 2,170 votes needed for the nomination. The Democrats were signaling their intention to make Florida a battleground in November.</p>
        <p>Shortly before the actual vote, the hall exploded in chants of ''We want Gore!'' when the vice president, unannounced, stepped briskly on stage from a submerged stairway to embrace his eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, after she seconded his nomination with a personal testament to her father. After waving to the roars of the more than 4,000 delegates, the Vice President strolled off stage with his daughter.</p>
        <p>The address by Mr. Lieberman, who will formally be nominated on Thursday, was one of the most anticipated, and consequential, moments of the four-night convention. The Gore campaign has counted on the senator to electrify the ticket of a standard bearer who has struggled to galvanize even loyal Democratic voters.</p>
        <p>Another reason for all the interest in Mr. Lieberman -- who was introduced by his wife, Hadassah, tonight as ''just a regular Joe'' -- is that when he was plucked by Mr. Gore eight days ago he was virtually unknown beyond his home state of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Though he has been a senator for 12 years, Mr. Lieberman, who is 58, is not nearly as tested on the national stage as Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, who had served as a Congressman, White House chief of staff and secretary of defense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman dutifully took on Mr. Bush and the Republicans, but without the hard edge of Mr. Cheney, who in his own acceptance speech two weeks ago at the Republican convention in Philadelphia bitterly ridiculed Mr. Gore and President Clinton.</p>
        <p>''It's this simple,'' Mr. Lieberman said flatly. ''We Democrats will expand the prosperity. They will squander it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's half-hour address was less a traditional attack on the opposition and more an American tale of the senator's life story. As Mr. Lieberman stepped to the rostrum, the hall swelled with music from the film ''Chariots of Fire'' -- the story of two track stars, a Jew who fought anti-Semitism to win an Olympic medal and a Christian who refused the importunings of the King of England to run on the Sabbath.</p>
        <p>While he said he was embarking on ''a miraculous journey,'' Mr. Lieberman first reached back to his own family's odyssey.</p>
        <p>Then, Mr. Lieberman remembered his grandmother.</p>
        <p>''She was raised in Central Europe,'' he said, ''in a village where she was often harassed because of the way she worshiped God. And then she immigrated to America.''</p>
        <p>He moved on to his parents, Henry and Marcia Lieberman. ''My father lived in an orphanage when he was a child,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''He went on to work in a bakery truck and then owned a package store in Stamford, Conn. He taught my sisters and me the importance of work and responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Turning to his mother in the audience, he said, ''Mom is 85 years old, but I'll tell you, she never felt younger than she feels today.''</p>
        <p>He progressed to the 1960's, describing himself as an early champion of civil rights. He was seeking to establish his credentials as a champion of minorities because of concerns among some black delegates that he did not adequately support affirmative action.</p>
        <p>''In the early 1960's, when I was a college student,'' he said, ''I walked with Martin Luther King in the March on Washington for jobs and freedom. That was my honor. That was my opportunity.''</p>
        <p>As attorney general of Connecticut, he said, ''I worked to be the people's lawyer. I went after polluters who were spoiling our water and our air.''</p>
        <p>Then he spoke of Hadassah, his wife, whose family, he said, was ''literally saved by the greatest generation of American G.I.'s who liberated the concentration camps.''</p>
        <p>While his delivery was earnest yet unadorned, it drew enthusiastic applause from the delegates. And his effort to reassure African Americans -- he was proceeded on stage by Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights hero -- seemed to meet with some success.</p>
        <p>''He talked about his civil rights record,'' said Virginia Rollins, a black delegate from Virginia. ''If anyone had doubts about where he stood, he took care of that tonight.''</p>
        <p>Beyond telling his story, Mr. Lieberman drew contrasts between his party and the Republicans. And he skipped over the fact that he is viewed as hewing to more moderate positions on a range of issues than Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Taking a shot at the Republicans who gathered in Philadelphia two weeks ago, Mr. Lieberman said, ''Our Republican friends tried to walk and talk a lot like us. But let's be honest. We may be near Hollywood. But not since Tom Hanks won an Oscar has there been that much acting in Philadelphia.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, who had not been widely viewed by most Democrats as a likely choice for Mr. Gore still seemed a bit fazed by his newfound celebrity and, perhaps, that Mr. Gore dared to pick a Jew. As he put it in his opening line, ''Is America a great country or what?''</p>
        <p>Before the program opened, Mr. Gore arrived here triumphantly, stepping off Air Force Two for a rally at the Burbank airport with Mr. Lieberman and their families. Only a day after President Clinton embraced Mr. Gore in Monroe, Mich., as the inheritor of his political legacy, the vice president moved to strike out on his own.</p>
        <p>''In every generation, we have to make the hard choices between one direction or another, between going back to the past or forward to the future,'' Mr. Gore declared. ''Let others argue the case for the old guard.  We're the new guard, and we're going to bring positive change to the United States of America.''</p>
        <p>Even if manufactured, the suspense today was inside the Staples Center. While Mr. Gore claimed enough delegates to put him over the top five months ago, this remained a night of triumph -- and, at long last, emergence -- for him. He represented Tennessee in the House for nine years and the Senate for eight years, but has been best known for his eight years of service to President Clinton.</p>
        <p>While his speech was not devoted to critiquing the opposition, as was Mr. Cheney's, Mr. Lieberman did scold Republicans for putting forth what he portrayed as a misleading festival of inclusion at its convention.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad that the G.O.P. has changed their rhetoric,'' he said, ''but I wish they would also change their policies. As my friend John McCain might say, let me do a little straight talking'' about their record.</p>
        <p>''It's a good thing that our opponent talks about education,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''Schools need to be held to the highest standards of performance and accountability. But I'm sad to say their plan just doesn't  provide the resources our schools need to meet those high standards.''</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Gore's often grueling primary race against Bill Bradley and his high-profile assignments from Mr. Clinton, like running a program to streamline the federal government, the vice president remains a bit of a mystery to the electorate.</p>
        <p>It has become almost a cliche for people to describe Mr. Gore as remote and hard to warm to. But Ms. Schiff, one of Mr. Gore's closest political advisers, sought to alter that perception by describing a sweet and conscientious Al Gore that the public does not know.</p>
        <p>''When my dad was a Congressman, he listed our number in the phone book in Carthage so the people he worked for could always reach him,'' Ms. Schiff said, seconding Mr. Gore's nomination. ''During my summers on the farm, I would answer the phone, and it would often be a constituent who needed help getting his veterans' benefits, or finding the right health care. I was taught to run -- not walk -- to get my dad so that people wouldn't be kept waiting for a moment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's name was put in nomination by Tommy Lee Jones, the actor who was one of his roommates at Harvard. Mr. Jones also tried to warm up Mr. Gore's image by attesting to the Gores' relationship, ''To this day,'' he said, ''when they come to our house, they sit in each other's laps. They hold hands. They even smooch occasionally -- like the kids they have always been.''</p>
        <p>Robert Rubin, a treasury secretary under Mr. Clinton, saluted Mr. Gore for his help in ensuring a vibrant economy. ''I worked with Al Gore for six and a half years,'' he said. ''And he was a powerful and effective force in all of the major economic policy decisions that contributed so critically to this record. I was there.''</p>
        <p>In the short term, at least, Mr. Lieberman brought the Democrats a wave of favorable publicity in the days leading to the convention. By turning to Mr. Lieberman, the first Democratic senator to aggressively repudiate President Clinton for his affair with a White House intern, Mr. Gore underscored his determination to shed the shadow of Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>In interviews in the convention hall today, dozens of delegates, one after another, said they had not known much about Mr. Lieberman until last week. But many said they were impressed, even thrilled, as they learned more about him.</p>
        <p>Eufaula Frazier, a delegate from Florida who is black, said she could relate to the historic nature of the Lieberman selection.</p>
        <p>''Forty years ago I was a beautician and we were all in the shop watching the TV, so excited we were about Kennedy being nominated,'' she said. ''The supply man came in and said it was incredible, a Catholic in such a position. He said maybe one day it will be a Jew. It is coming true tonight, and I get to be a part of it.''</p>
        <p>TV Coverage Today</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore will deliver his acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention about 10 tonight. It will be carried live on ABC, CBS, CNN, C-Span, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, NBC, NY1 and PBS.</p>
