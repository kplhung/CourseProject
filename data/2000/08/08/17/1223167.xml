        <p>As health officials outlined plans yesterday to spray heavily populated areas of Brooklyn with pesticides for the first time this year to combat the West Nile virus, they also reported that traces of the virus had been detected in five live birds near Prospect Park and three dead ones in Manhattan and Queens.</p>
        <p>The five live birds -- four sparrows and a mockingbird -- were captured during field research last month in Greenwood Cemetery by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said John Gadd, a spokesman for the New York City Health Department. It was the first time this year that live birds had been found with the virus, he said.</p>

        <p>As health officials outlined plans yesterday to spray heavily populated areas of Brooklyn with pesticides for the first time this year to combat the West Nile virus, they also reported that traces of the virus had been detected in five live birds near Prospect Park and three dead ones in Manhattan and Queens.</p>
        <p>The five live birds -- four sparrows and a mockingbird -- were captured during field research last month in Greenwood Cemetery by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said John Gadd, a spokesman for the New York City Health Department. It was the first time this year that live birds had been found with the virus, he said.</p>
        <p>At a news conference yesterday in the Bronx, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the birds were old enough that they may have contracted the virus last year. The mockingbird, though, was only 3 months old, he said, so it must have been infected this year.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, health officials reported that the virus had been found in a dead crow in the Canarsie section. Brooklyn was the last of the five boroughs to report finding the virus in birds or mosquito pools this year, Mr. Gadd said.</p>
        <p>Health officials said yesterday that they would spray within a two-mile radius of Canarsie late tonight, and in Prospect Park and Greenwood Cemetery tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>The announcement was not the only news in what has become the biggest preoccupation of local and state health officials this summer. Officials also reported that 11 more dead birds throughout the state tested positive for the virus, including 2 in Manhattan and one each in Queens, Rockland and Dutchess Counties, said Kristine Smith, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Health.</p>
        <p>The New York City birds were found on the Upper West Side, in northern Manhattan and in Beechhurst, Queens, Mr. Gadd said. Twenty-seven mosquito pools -- 23 in Staten Island, 3 in Central Park and one in Hunts Point, the Bronx -- also tested positive. As a result, he said, more spraying plans for those areas will be announced today.</p>
        <p>Last year, the disease circulated primarily in Queens and killed 7 people and sickened 55 others throughout the metropolitan area. This year, though, the disease was centered on Staten Island, and officials issued another reminder yesterday of additional spraying, including some sections by helicopter, from 7 tonight until 5 a.m. tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Three people, all Staten Island residents, have tested positive for the virus this year, as have 213 birds, 114 mosquito pools and one sentinel chicken, Ms. Smith said. In New Jersey, 89 birds have tested positive this year, including 37 in Bergen County, while 25 infected birds have been found in Connecticut.</p>
