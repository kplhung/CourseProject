        <p>No doubt about it, Joseph I. Lieberman is a trailblazer. Tonight he surely became the first vice-presidential candidate in American history to begin his convention speech with a mother-in-law joke.</p>
        <p>''There's an old saying that behind every successful man, there is a surprised mother-in-law,'' Mr. Lieberman, lifting his eyebrows for emphasis, told a national television audience after being introduced by his wife, Hadassah. ''I am here to tell you, It's true.''</p>

        <p>No doubt about it, Joseph I. Lieberman is a trailblazer. Tonight he surely became the first vice-presidential candidate in American history to begin his convention speech with a mother-in-law joke.</p>
        <p>''There's an old saying that behind every successful man, there is a surprised mother-in-law,'' Mr. Lieberman, lifting his eyebrows for emphasis, told a national television audience after being introduced by his wife, Hadassah. ''I am here to tell you, It's true.''</p>
        <p>That was just one of a string of borscht belt lines that Senator Lieberman has delivered in recent days. At a meeting of 200 Hispanic Democrats today, he said he was thrilled when Vice President Al Gore made that special phone call last week. But  he added, ''I'll be honest with you: I'd be excited if just about anybody else called.''</p>
        <p>The talk of this convention has been comparisons between John F. Kennedy's religion breakthrough 40 years ago and Mr. Lieberman's now. But it may have been Henny Youngman, Rodney Dangerfield, Jack Benny or any of the legions of other Jewish comedians, whose distinctive humor has permeated the popular culture so thoroughly, who also paved the way for Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>''I love Joe,'' said the comedian Al Franken, who picked Mr. Lieberman as his own running mate in his recent faux presidential campaign book, ''Why Not Me?''</p>
        <p>''Joe read the book,'' Mr. Franken said, ''and made up some bumper stickers for an all-Jewish ticket. 'Franken-Lieberman: No Pork, No Bull,' and one for the angry white male voters, 'Lox and Load.' He's a happy fellow.''</p>
        <p>At another point today, Mr. Lieberman welcomed Al and Tipper Gore  to the convention, meeting them at Burbank Airport with a twist on Ronald Reagan's old standby line. ''I've been waiting for a week to say this,'' Mr. Lieberman began, ''and I can't control myself anymore. In this election, will you help me win one for the Tipper?''</p>
        <p>Talking to gay and lesbian Democrats at a caucus meeting, he quoted his parents in an accent of pure shtick: ''When I went into politics, my parents said, 'You can make a living from this?' ''</p>
        <p>And at the convention tonight he  brought down the house by lambasting the Republicans with this line: ''Not since Tom Hanks won an Oscar has there been that much acting in Philadelphia.''</p>
        <p>A veteran movie producer here, Sean Daniel, who is Jewish, said he was sure his Jewish friends in the entertainment industry would appreciate Mr. Lieberman's efforts despite his sometimes caustic critiques of the moral content of the industry's  work. In fact, he said, some Jews in the business told him they would be going home early to catch Mr. Lieberman's speech tonight.</p>
        <p>''Hollywood might take issue with some of his pronouncements, and at the same time see its own roots in Lieberman's material,'' Mr. Daniel said. ''I'm not being facetious. That will surface quickly in the brain of any Hollywood viewer. It's turning into quite a matter of pride.''</p>
        <p>''What can I say?'' Mr. Daniel added, in a line of his own. ''We're funny.''</p>
