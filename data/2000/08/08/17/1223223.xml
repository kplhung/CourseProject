        <p>Shareholders of the animated filmmaker Cinar Corporation, who have been unable to trade their shares for the last five months, were warned by the company that several more months might pass before revised financial statements were delivered to regulators. After accusations of tax fraud and the disclosure that $122 million was missing, the Montreal company was ordered to revise its accounts for the last three fiscal years. Most of the lost money has been recovered, and television programs continue to be made. But several lawsuits have been filed, and trading in Cinar shares has been suspended by the Nasdaq and Toronto stock markets.</p>
