        <p>Facing growing criticism that regulators should have  spotted problems with Firestone tires sooner, federal officials said today that they were working on tougher tire rules, particularly for sport utility vehicles and other so-called light trucks.</p>
        <p>State Farm, the nation's largest auto insurer, said today that it had sent an e-mail message to regulators in July 1998, alerting them that it had received 21 claims involving Firestone tire failures over the previous six and a half years. The insurer's officials also mentioned the problem during a routine telephone discussion of pending safety issues with regulators a year ago, said Stephen Witmer, a State Farm spokesman.</p>
        <p>The Ford Motor Company, which installed on its Ford Explorer sport utility  vehicles most of the tires now being recalled, has acknowledged that it recalled some Ford Explorers overseas with identical tires last year but did not tell the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department. The agency decided in the 1980's that its legal authority did not extend to requiring reporting of overseas recalls, and automakers stopped doing so voluntarily a decade ago, said Joan Claybrook, the agency's administrator during the Carter administration and now the president of Public Citizen, an advocacy group.</p>
        <p>Regulators also no longer collect data directly from repair shops on safety defects, a program that used to provide early warning of safety issues. The agency maintained contact with an extensive network of repair shops in the 1970's but allowed it to disappear in the 1980's, when the agency's budget was cut in half by President Ronald Reagan, who criticized the agency as an example of excessive regulatory zeal.</p>
        <p>Safety agency officials defended their handling of the Firestone tire problems today, saying that they had acted in a timely manner once a pattern of consumer complaints to the agency had emerged. The agency's current lawyers share the view of their predecessors in the 1980's that there is an ''extraterritoriality exemption'' implicit in the agency's statutes that prevents the gathering of data on overseas recalls involving autos and auto parts also sold in the United States, officials said.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Neblett, an agency spokeswoman, said that no one at the agency today could recall having heard of any warning from State Farm. But she cautioned that one agency employee who keeps track of such warnings was not in the office this week.</p>
        <p>Plaintiffs' lawyers also criticize the agency for not using its subpoena powers to demand from them various documents that they have obtained from Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone, a unit of Bridgestone of Japan. The lawyers got them during the discovery process of various lawsuits. The lawyers are prevented from sharing the information openly because the companies labeled the documents as trade secrets in providing them.</p>
        <p>But Rae Tyson, also an agency spokesman, said that the agency was confident that it would obtain all relevant documents through its own requests to Ford and Firestone.</p>
        <p>While continuing to study what went wrong in the 6.5 million Firestone tires being recalled, regulators are starting to look at how to draft new rules for tire design.</p>
        <p>Stephen R. Kratzke, the safety agency's associate administrator for safety performance standards, said that new rules were needed. More Americans are driving sport utility vehicles and other light trucks, and Americans have been driving faster after the repeal of the national speed limit of 55 miles an hour, he said.</p>
        <p>High-speed travel puts more strain on tires. And tall vehicles are more likely to roll over if they lose a tire, making it particularly important that their tires are reliable, Mr. Kratzke said.</p>
        <p>''There's no question from looking at our data that a light truck is more  prone to roll over than a car'' when a tire fails, Mr. Kratzke said. Virtually all of the 62 deaths attributed to tires so far in reports to regulators were on sport utility vehicles that rolled over.</p>
        <p>The current safety test for high-speed driving requires that car tires not fail when driven on a machine for half an hour at 75 miles an hour, half an hour at 80 miles an hour and half an hour at 85 miles an hour. For off-road tires and heavy-duty tires for large pickup trucks, the test is conducted at a speed 5 miles an hour slower for each of the half-hour tests.</p>
        <p>Many of the complaints involving the Firestone tires, which were certified to the car standard rather than the off-road standard, involved incidents that occurred during highway driving at a minimum of 55 miles an hour. Mr. Kratzke said that he was studying a requirement that off-road tires and possibly heavy-duty tires meet the same standards as car tires, and that all of these tires pass a test of at least 100 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>The safety agency began studying the problem of Firestone tires in February, when a Houston television station's report on tire problems prompted several dozen people in Texas to report similar trouble to regulators. The agency opened a formal investigation in May, its 20th by then in 2000 alone, after accumulating 90 complaints involving four deaths. All but two dozen of the complaints came in this year, even though the Explorer has been on sale since 1990 and a handful of lawsuits citing tire failures were filed as early as 1993. With national attention on the problem, the number of complaints to regulators has soared to more than 750, involving more than 100 injuries and at least 62 deaths.</p>
        <p>Mr. Witmer of State Farm said that the insurer had repeatedly collected money from Firestone over the last three years after contending that manufacturing defects in the tires made the tire maker, and not State Farm, responsible for covering the cost of claims. Firestone paid the first of these claims, for $9,700, in October 1997, he said. State Farm's moves were first reported today by The Los Angeles Times.</p>
        <p>Christine Karbowiak, a Firestone spokeswoman, said that the tire maker frequently paid claims from insurers because it was cheaper than contesting them.</p>
        <p>Allstate and Farmers Insurance, the nation's second- and third-largest auto insurers, respectively, said that they were not aware of a problem with Firestone tires until the last two weeks. But both insurers said they were reviewing their records in anticipation of filing possible claims with Firestone.</p>
