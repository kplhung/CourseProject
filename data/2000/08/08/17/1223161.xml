        <p>Its bureaucracy stretched thin by the burdens of battling wildfires scorching the West, the United States Forest Service has begun bringing back retired workers, hiring employees' spouses and taking other unusual steps to increase the number of people available to fight the fires.</p>
        <p>The measures underscore longstanding concerns that the agency does not have enough trained staff to handle a summer with severe and widespread forest fires.</p>
        <p>''We don't have the inherent depth for fire seasons like this one now,'' said Harry Croft, deputy director at the fire and aviation management division of the forest service. ''We need a massive injection of new people into this organization, or in 10 years, we are going to be sucking swamp water.''</p>
        <p>Michael P. Dombeck, chief of the Forest Service, sent a memorandum to staff members in late July encouraging them to lend a hand with the firefighting efforts.</p>
        <p>''We are experiencing shortages in virtually every incident management position,'' Mr. Dombeck wrote, reminding his staff that ''we all have roles and responsibilities during fire emergencies.''</p>
        <p>All Forest Service employees, regardless of job description, are encouraged to undergo training so they can help fight fires, often in a management or administrative capacity.</p>
        <p>The agency was unable to provide an estimate of the number of staff members who had volunteered.</p>
        <p>Since the distribution of the memorandum, the fires have significantly worsened, and the agency is scrambling to get enough people into the field. In addition to encouraging administrative, management and other office workers to abandon their desks for the field, the agency is hiring retired employees, the spouses of current ones and people who live near the fires.</p>
        <p>Retired workers often have skills that are in short supply, Mr. Croft said. They can, for example, manage the money and paperwork needed to pay contract workers hired at fire sites, and they can make sure equipment is properly cared for and effectively deployed, he said.</p>
        <p>Other workers are needed for jobs like driving trucks, providing food and directing traffic near the fires.</p>
        <p>The Forest Service, a branch of the Agriculture Department, has been criticized for much of the last decade for not having enough employees trained to fight fires. In 1994, after one of the most severe fire seasons in history, the agency set the goal of ''preparing 75 percent of its work force to be trained, qualified and available to support fire emergencies by the year 2000.''</p>
        <p>That goal proved too ambitious;  the agency estimates that only about 50 percent of its staff is properly trained now.</p>
        <p>The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, reported in August that if more Forest Service employees were not trained, the service's ability to fight fires would be greatly compromised. The G.A.O. recommended making it a requirement that ''all employees become qualified, in some manner, to contribute to fighting fires.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Croft said that that was not practical because the agency had evolved and that specialization of the work force was now necessary.</p>
        <p>Another report, released in January and commissioned by Mr. Dombeck, said that the agency's ability to fight large fires adequately was ''diminishing'' because of significant changes in its work force. Those changes include a shrinking services staff, a reduced willingness among employees to ''support emergency fire efforts occurring away from their assigned locations'' and the perception that ''active fire participation is not career enhancing.''</p>
        <p>The best way to solve the current staffing problems, the report said, is to create a national organization dedicated exclusively to fighting large wildfires. That would mean abandoning the tradition of encouraging all employees to be trained to fight fires.</p>
        <p>Mr. Croft, who endorsed the recommendation, said that times had changed. ''We can no longer rely on people's good will to fight these fires,'' he said.</p>
