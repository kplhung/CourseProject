        <p>Editorial says speech by Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen Joe Lieberman at Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles was blend of personal reminiscences and condemnation of Republican policies and was forceful effort that cleared way for Vice Pres Gore's all-important address; says while he can help to establish aura of confidence around ticket, it is up to Gore to make impression on public and to walk out of shadow of Pres Clinton and waves of nostalgia that have washed over convention for days (M)</p>

        <p>It was a long time in coming, but last night Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut finally moved to center stage at the Democratic convention. Mr. Gore's arrival in Los Angeles and Mr. Lieberman's emotional speech accepting the vice-presidential nomination sought to move the party beyond its tributes to the Clinton era and to present a new ticket with its own agenda and less baggage. Mr. Lieberman's speech was a blend of personal reminiscence and condemnation of Republican policies on schools and health care. It was a forceful effort, clearing the way for Mr. Gore's all-important address tonight.</p>
        <p>The selection of Senator Lieberman has worked well for Mr. Gore, giving Mr. Gore credibility as a risk-taker and tightening the polls. Since it also  stirred a few concerns in parts of the Democratic base, Mr. Lieberman reached out to those groups in his speech. Addressing blacks and liberals worried about his record on affirmative action, he spoke of his family escaping tyranny in Europe and his lifelong fight against discrimination. ''That's why I continue to say, when it comes to affirmative action, mend it, don't end it,'' he declared.</p>

        <p>It was a long time in coming, but last night Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut finally moved to center stage at the Democratic convention. Mr. Gore's arrival in Los Angeles and Mr. Lieberman's emotional speech accepting the vice-presidential nomination sought to move the party beyond its tributes to the Clinton era and to present a new ticket with its own agenda and less baggage. Mr. Lieberman's speech was a blend of personal reminiscence and condemnation of Republican policies on schools and health care. It was a forceful effort, clearing the way for Mr. Gore's all-important address tonight.</p>
        <p>The selection of Senator Lieberman has worked well for Mr. Gore, giving Mr. Gore credibility as a risk-taker and tightening the polls. Since it also  stirred a few concerns in parts of the Democratic base, Mr. Lieberman reached out to those groups in his speech. Addressing blacks and liberals worried about his record on affirmative action, he spoke of his family escaping tyranny in Europe and his lifelong fight against discrimination. ''That's why I continue to say, when it comes to affirmative action, mend it, don't end it,'' he declared.</p>
        <p>Other traditional Democrats say they are worried about Mr. Lieberman's centrist philosophy challenging liberal orthodoxy on school vouchers and privatization of Social Security. In response, Mr. Lieberman offered a robust attack on Gov. George W. Bush's approach to government and spoke of the ''real differences'' with the G.O.P. nominees, whom he spoke of as ''decent and likable men.'' He also signaled the possibility of some tough oratory to come. In Philadelphia Mr. Bush had declared ''Don't mess with Texas,'' but Mr. Lieberman drew cheers last night when he declared that for all the Republican promises, Texas lagged seriously in health care and cleaning up the environment. Scoffing again at claims by the Bush campaign that he is actually closer to the Republicans, he declared, ''I'm glad the G.O.P. has changed their rhetoric, but I wish they would also change their policies.''</p>
        <p>The attacks on Republicans were designed to assuage Democratic liberals about battles they actually lost when President Clinton moved the party to the center. For the larger national audience, Mr. Lieberman's appearance was intended as a signal that this ticket was moving beyond Mr. Clinton's behavioral -- as opposed to his policy -- legacy. Mr. Lieberman's authority in this regard derives from his moral bearing, embodied in his criticism of Mr. Clinton's conduct two years ago.</p>
        <p>Just as it was a tricky exercise for Mr. Lieberman to assail Mr. Clinton's conduct as immoral and also vote against his removal from office, so has it been a balancing act for him to speak openly of his deep religious conviction without crossing the boundary that separates religion from the affairs of state. As the first Jew to be nominated for vice president by a major party, he paid tribute to his immigrant grandparents and to the ''only-in-America'' quality of his selection. Then he moved on to a combined moral and economic message that will become a main Democratic theme. It is not ''the size of our national feast that is important,'' he said, ''but the number of people we can fit around the table -- there must be room for everybody.''</p>
        <p>For all the warmth of their response, the delegates in the Staples arena know that a vice-presidential choice rarely makes a decisive difference. But a vice-presidential candidate can help establish an aura of confidence around a ticket. Mr. Gore's supporters can hope that the selection of Mr. Lieberman attests to the ability of their nominee to think originally, shatter the old barriers of prejudice and feel comfortable with challenging ideas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman spoke fervently of his long admiration for and friendship with Mr. Gore, as well as the ''private moments of prayer'' he had shared with him. But if Mr. Gore is to make an impression on the public this week and walk out of the shadow of Mr. Clinton and the waves of nostalgia that have washed over the convention since last weekend, that work still belongs mainly to one person. His turn will come tonight.</p>
