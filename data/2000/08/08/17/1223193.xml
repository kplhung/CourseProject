        <p>Over slick boulders and thick roots, across narrow bridges and through mud that coated their limbs, three hikers in wheelchairs and two on crutches won a 12-hour struggle up a mountain trail here Tuesday to reach a hut that naysayers had said they would never use.</p>
        <p>The moral being, said one hiker: Do not tell us where we will not, and can not, go.</p>
        <p>Their destination, the Galehead hut at an elevation of 3,800 feet, has just been rebuilt by the Appalachian Mountain Club. During its construction, some club members and New Hampshire newspapers ridiculed the idea of making the rustic 38-bed lodge accessible to the handicapped, complete with a ramp and ''grab bars'' in larger toilet stalls. It was an absurd waste of money, they said, as no one in a wheelchair was ever going to get over the super-rugged 4.6-mile trail.</p>
        <p>Wrong. Under their own power, but also helped mightily by family, friends and volunteers who pulled, pushed and tipped them over boulder after boulder, the three hikers in wheelchairs reached the wood-shingled hut at sunset -- and, with the happy exhaustion of any hiker and then some, rolled up the welcoming ramp to dinner.</p>
        <p>The hikers' achievement, and the controversy that spurred it, highlighted a broader phenomenon in the country's wilderness areas: a push to make everything from outhouses to campgrounds more friendly to disabled people -- and the debate it sometimes raises over the wisdom of trying to make the naturally hard-to-get-to outdoors more accessible.</p>
        <p>United States Forest Service officials say they have no plans to pave trails or significantly change the experience of wilderness to conform to federal disability rules. But Janet A. Zeller, who oversees the agency's push for accessibility, said: ''When you get to a person-built facility, you're beyond what nature has put there for you, and you're into what people have built, and therefore it needs to meet a standard so that when you get to a structure, you know what to expect. It's that 'Whew!' at the end of the day.''</p>
        <p>The National Forests in the service's Eastern Region, which ranges from Maine to Minnesota and Missouri to West Virginia, spent $2 million in the last year and $18 million in the last eight on improving accessibility, Ms. Zeller said, and has been working on general guidelines for outdoor access.</p>
        <p>In the case of the Galehead hut, Appalachian Mountain Club officials estimate they paid an extra $30,000 to $50,000 for a building that was already costing about $400,000.</p>
        <p>But New Hampshire is a flinty-spirited state, and the modifications to the hut were pricey because they were done at the last minute: the mountain club learned only belatedly from the Forest Service that the hut, even though it is among the club's remotest, must comply with the accessibility rules for new buildings in the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the club's leadership did not mind. Walter Graff, the group's deputy director, said that the hut ended up with a better overall design, including widened hallways,  a porch and the elimination of steps up to the bathrooms.</p>
        <p>''The A.M.C. is about bringing people to the outdoors,'' Mr. Graff said. ''The fact they're in wheelchairs or otherwise disabled shouldn't prevent that.''</p>
        <p>But others did mind, or at least raised challenges. A local television reporter asked why, if people in wheelchairs could drag themselves up the trail, they could not drag themselves up steps to the hut. One Appalachian Mountain Club member wrote to the group's magazine: ''So what does a tired hiker see when he gets to the hut? A wheelchair ramp. Any reasonable person is going to be shocked, then bemused. What a waste of money.'' Another said that the federal disability rules could be read to mean that all trails should be paved, and demanded, ''When will A.M.C. start to fight such insane regulations instead of meekly acquiescing?''</p>
        <p>At Northeast Passage, a program at the University of New Hampshire that works with people with disabilities, news that the hut would be accessible at first prompted casual plans to try to go, said Jill Gravink, the program's director.</p>
        <p>Then, when the criticism started coming out, ''All of a sudden it was, 'Hey, we have to make this trip,' '' she said. ''Nicole Haley rolled into my office with a newspaper article and said, 'I'm doing this, are you guys coming?' '' They took it as a real slap in the face, like, 'Who are you to tell me I can't do this? How do you know how much of my own sweat I'm willing to put into getting up there?' ''</p>
        <p>(As for the television reporter, Ms. Gravink said she responded: ''Why bother putting steps on the hut at all? Why not drag yourself in through a window?'')</p>
        <p>And so, after almost a year of planning, with organization by Northeast Passage and help from We Media, an advocacy media group for people with disabilities, along with other sponsors, the hikers set off about 7:30 a.m. Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The three who used wheelchairs were trying out special Terra Trek-brand models engineered for the most rugged terrain; they and their helpers had devised a variety of tested but still experimental tricks, from long poles that could let helpers lift the wheelchairs almost like rickshaw bearers, to tethers that let helpers pull the chairs like oxen, to simple planks that could be laid over brook crossings or rough ground.</p>
        <p>Geoff Krill, a ski instructor and hotel clerk whose 60-year-old father, Phil, helped push and pull his wheelchair, said that in making the trip, he wanted to show people in wheelchairs that they could get out and enjoy the woods, though not necessarily on such difficult trails.</p>
        <p>The trail started out relatively gentle, though every root, every rock demanded effort that able-bodied hikers would never think about. Early on, Craig Gray, a management consultant and Paralympic cross-country skier, took a graceful tumble in his wheelchair down a hill, but the teams of helpers quickly learned how to keep their wheelchair athletes upright.</p>
        <p>By about 10 a.m., the going got slower, and at about 10:30 came the one sour note of the day: a hiker who cursed at the group for blocking the trail and said he thought the whole thing was ridiculous, adding an expletive for emphasis.</p>
        <p>After lunch by a rushing river came the hardest part: the infamous boulder-staircase known as Jacob's Ladder, with rounded rock steps big enough to get any hiker huffing. The group tried a modified Tyrolean traverse, lifting the wheelchairs off the ground with ropes and letting their occupants pull themselves upward with a pulley system.</p>
        <p>It worked, but not well, and the hikers in wheelchairs went back to other techniques, including the move that Mr. Gray called the ''butt-up,'' in which he simply sat with his back facing the boulder staircase and lifted himself from step to step using upper body strength.</p>
        <p>Each wheelchair-hiker developed a different style. At one point, the group around Nicole Haley, who has used a wheelchair since she fell off a ladder two years ago, resorted to singing ''You've Lost that Loving Feeling,'' to keep its strength up, and sent renditions over walkie-talkies to other groups. Mr. Gray's team had a slightly macho style, using exhortations like ''Let's eat that rock!''</p>
        <p>All reached the hut at sundown, too tired for ringing pronouncements, having completed in 12 hours what takes an average able-bodied hiker 3 1/2. Though Souley Marzouk, who  was one of two who made the trek on crutches, together with Dr. Susan Murray, did say: ''This shows how determined we are, and how far determination can take you. It wasn't easy but I guess we figured it wasn't going to be, and that's why we did it.''</p>
        <p>Soon everyone went inside to the cozy wooden warmth for potato soup and cheese steak -- and champagne -- at the hut's long tables. They were to spend today relaxing at the hut, and Thursday facing a whole new challenge: the way down.</p>
        <p>Would the hut's ramp ever really be used again? Would they ever, really, want to do this again, after all the almost-tipping and rib-bruising and grueling labor? Sure, said Mr. Krill, 29. ''Next time I can get enough people to do it with me.''</p>
