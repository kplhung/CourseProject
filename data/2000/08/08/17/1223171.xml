        <p>Dara Torres won the women's 50-meter freestyle tonight in 24.90 seconds, becoming, at age 33, the oldest woman to win a race at the United States Olympic swimming trials. Her half-minute swim, however, was preceded by hours of instruction from an entourage of 10 experts who aided her in everything from her psychological state to her nutrition to the manipulation of her lymph system.</p>
        <p>After a layoff of seven years, in which she worked as a fashion model and a television commentator, Torres returned to swimming a year ago and has now qualified to swim three individual events and three relays next month at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.</p>

        <p>Dara Torres won the women's 50-meter freestyle tonight in 24.90 seconds, becoming, at age 33, the oldest woman to win a race at the United States Olympic swimming trials. Her half-minute swim, however, was preceded by hours of instruction from an entourage of 10 experts who aided her in everything from her psychological state to her nutrition to the manipulation of her lymph system.</p>
        <p>After a layoff of seven years, in which she worked as a fashion model and a television commentator, Torres returned to swimming a year ago and has now qualified to swim three individual events and three relays next month at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>It is unprecedented for anyone to return to an elite level of swimming after so many years away from the sport. During her retirement everything changed, from the way strokes are performed in the water to the way athletes eat and train.</p>
        <p>Richard Quick, coach of the American women's Olympic swim team and Torres's personal coach in Palo Alto, Calif., said swimmers have become a bit like race cars, spending minutes at peak performance and hours in the body shop being tinkered with by mechanics. In races decided by hundredths of a second, the slightest advantage can be significant.</p>
        <p>Quick's methods have been productive at the trials. Jenny Thompson, one of his swimmers, won both the women's 100-meter butterfly and 100-meter freestyle. Torres won the 50-meter freestyle and finished second in the 100-meter butterfly and 100-meter freestyle. Misty Hyman won the 200-meter butterfly. As the trials concluded tonight, Torres defeated the reigning Olympic champion in the 50 freestyle, Amy Van Dyken, who finished second in 24.99, continuing her own comeback from shoulder surgery.</p>
        <p>The Stanford group is hardly the only one to develop a training regimen as high-tech as the bodysuits worn at these trials. Gary Hall Jr. won the men's 50-meter freestyle on Tuesday with a nutritional regimen that resembles that of Fusaichi Pegasus, the winner of the Kentucky Derby, according to Hall's coach in Phoenix, Mike Bottom.</p>
        <p>Quick said his idea for an inclusive regimen came from an article he read about how Martina Navratilova traveled with a psychologist, nutritionist and strength coach during her heyday on the women's tennis circuit.</p>
        <p>''I thought, wow, how could I put that in place for swimmers?'' Quick said.</p>
        <p>He said he paid the expenses at the trials for a 10-person group that included a nutritionist, two massage therapists, a physical therapist, a performance expert, a lymph system manipulator, a chiropractor, two stretching experts and an instructor in Pilates, a strength and stretching regimen. Torres and Thompson also pay separately for strength training with Robert Weir, a British discus and hammer-throw champion.</p>
        <p>Torres works four to six hours a day outside the pool on various aspects of her physical and mental preparation, Quick said.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people wonder how she achieved so much so quickly,'' he said. ''I guarantee that if you follow her around for one week, you'd be exhausted just by the schedule. She's crowded two to three years of training into 13 months.''</p>
        <p>The experts have agreed to work without pay, Quick said, adding that he had created a foundation to raise $90,000 to $100,000 to pay for their travel and housing expenses at the Olympics. Half the money remains to be raised, with the Summer Games beginning on Sept. 15. He will borrow money, if necessary, to get the entourage to Sydney, Quick said.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to have these athletes shortchanged at the most critical moment in their careers,'' Quick said.</p>
        <p>Torres won two gold medals on relay teams before retiring in 1992. Her resurgent career represents the possibilities now available to women in the age of professional Olympic sports a generation after the gender-equity mandate of Title IX. Prize money and endorsements sustain careers that, three decades ago, were forced to end in high school. But Torres has needed acute vigilance to remain at the top into her 30's.</p>
        <p>Glen Luepnitz, a nutrition expert, monitors Torres's protein-laden diet of six meals a day, and he draws her blood every two weeks to analyze her oxygen-carrying capacity, lactic acid buildup and immune system. He gives her up to 25 supplement pills a day. Richard Diana, a performance expert, is a proponent of Knowing Awareness Thinking, which aids athletes in achieving a confident, uncluttered mind-set before races.</p>
        <p>''It's a matter of building confidence,'' Quick said. ''You can have a fire to train and still not have confidence to perform.''</p>
        <p>Dale Perry massages Torres's lymph system to help rid her body of toxins. A pair of trainers, Bob Cooley and Tom Longo, perform Meridian Resistance Flexibility exercises, which include walking over her legs and her back to relax the muscles. Team Torres also uses a device to help cool her after races, putting a rubberized sleeve around her legs and pumping in cold water.</p>
        <p>''I think a lot of it has to do with nutrition'' Torres said of her resurgence. ''Richard is one of the best coaches in the world. He knows how to train sprinters. He's added a lot of recovery into our workouts. The weight training is different and the mental attitude is different.''</p>
        <p>Because so little is known about women performing at their peak into their 30's, however, the Torres regimen remains one of trial and error. She said her tired legs gave out on her in the 100-meter freestyle, and she has experienced repeated cramping during the trials.</p>
        <p>Dr. Don Catlin, who operates the Olympic drug-testing lab at U.C.L.A., cautioned that athletes who take supplements risk testing positive for some banned substance because of improper labeling. Dr. Gary Green, an internist at U.C.L.A. who is head of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's drug-testing program, said few peer-reviewed studies had been done to correlate the effect of supplements on performance enhancement.</p>
        <p>The only way to show scientifically whether legal supplements can mimic the effects of banned drugs is for athletes to take the supplements and then take steroids, and then compare the performances, Green said. ''No one is going to do that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The most direct impact on performance could be a placebo effect, he said. And even high-tech gadgets, Quick said, ''can't substitute for hard work, dedication and consistent effort.''</p>
