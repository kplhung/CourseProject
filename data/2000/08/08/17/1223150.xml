        <p>At the Democratic convention this week, good manners reign supreme.

        <p>At the Democratic convention this week, good manners reign supreme. Despite many doubts, most African-American delegates are supporting Al Gore's choice for a running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman. Even Maxine Waters, the outspoken congresswoman from California, has announced that after talking to Mr. Lieberman about his views on affirmative action, she is now on board.</p>
        <p>But outward party unity doesn't mean that internal fissures have disappeared. Indeed, the selection of Mr. Lieberman points to some real differences between Mr. Gore and black Democrats. And these differences are important to his chances in November.</p>
        <p>There is general agreement among political analysts that the election will be close and that the states between New Jersey and Missouri (plus North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee) are likely to determine the next president.</p>
        <p>These states have significant numbers of black voters, who are reliably Democratic, that is, if they go to the polls. To win this election, Mr. Gore will have to ensure that black turnout is high.</p>
        <p>The problem? It's hard to imagine that his selection of Mr. Lieberman will galvanize them to vote. As a pollster and researcher who has long followed African-American politics, I know that of all the people mentioned as Mr. Gore's possible running mate, Mr. Lieberman was the one least likely to appeal to African-Americans.</p>
        <p>There are political reasons why this is so. Despite his reassurances this week, he was not known as a supporter of affirmative action, especially after his favorable comments about California's proposition that outlawed affirmative action in all state programs. In addition, for four years, he has been chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, which represents moderate and conservative Democrats as a counterweight to liberals like Jesse Jackson.</p>
        <p>Some observers have said that anti-Semitism among a minority of the black population could play a role. There have been several surveys, most notably those done for the Anti-Defamation League, that suggest African-Americans are more anti-Semitic than white Americans. I don't entirely buy the results of these surveys, in part because anti-Semitism, like racism, is a difficult thing to assess.</p>
        <p>In surveys, for example, I have heard African-Americans refer to Jewish wealth, but many working class and poor African-Americans talk that way about all white people.</p>
        <p>In the case of the Democratic ticket, there is more a sense of ''why not us?''  Many black Americans feel they have been the most loyal Democrats and wonder why a black politician hasn't been selected by now. This feeling is not about anti-Semitism, but about once again being left out.</p>
        <p>The root of black ambivalence about Mr. Lieberman, however, could be more specific. The vice president chose the one man who carries with him an implicit, some would say open, repudiation of Bill Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's speech calling Mr. Clinton's actions immoral in the Monica Lewinsky scandal was widely praised. Indeed, after Mr. Lieberman was selected, this factor was cited favorably, and seen as helping Al Gore distance himself from the president.</p>
        <p>Here's a news flash for you: Black Americans want to celebrate Mr. Clinton. They don't care about his personal life. During his administration, African-Americans have prospered as never before. Incomes have risen faster than those of whites. Affirmative action has been protected. Mr. Clinton made Africa part of his foreign policy. The cabinet has been inclusive.</p>
        <p>In short, Bill Clinton already has a legacy -- he is the first president to fully embrace black America.</p>
        <p>In the last eight years, African-Americans have gotten used to being taken seriously. They want that influence to continue, and are waiting for Mr. Gore to send a signal that it will. Unfortunately, his selection of Mr. Lieberman sends a different signal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore now finds himself in a position of having to assure black voters that they will have a real voice in his administration, that their concerns will be addressed. The pollsters can talk all they want about reaching out to swing voters. But Al Gore knows he cannot win without his party's most loyal voters.</p>
