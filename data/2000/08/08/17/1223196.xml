        <p>With its stock price down sharply, AT&amp;T will probably decide on a significant restructuring next month, possibly including a leveraged buyout led by John C. Malone of the company's consumer long-distance telephone business, people close to AT&amp;T said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The company is considering a broad range of potential moves meant to emphasize its strengths. Those options may increase over the next few weeks; the people close to AT&amp;T said its investment bankers were hard at work developing new strategies.

        <p>With its stock price down sharply, AT&amp;T will probably decide on a significant restructuring next month, possibly including a leveraged buyout led by John C. Malone of the company's consumer long-distance telephone business, people close to AT&amp;T said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The company is considering a broad range of potential moves meant to emphasize its strengths. Those options may increase over the next few weeks; the people close to AT&amp;T said its investment bankers were hard at work developing new strategies. In addition, a person close to the senior leadership said that at least a preliminary decision would probably be reached at the next board meeting, scheduled for the third week of September.</p>
        <p>Still, it is unlikely that an announcement will be made shortly after that meeting, a person close to the discussions said.</p>
        <p>In addition to a potential buyout of the consumer unit, AT&amp;T's other options include issuing new shares meant to track the consumer unit, issuing shares meant to track the cable television operations and simply selling one or both of those units to other publicly traded companies.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T might choose to do nothing, of course. Support on the board for C. Michael Armstrong, the chairman, is strong. But many analysts believe that he cannot survive next year unless the company is revamped or the prospects for AT&amp;T as currently structured somehow brighten significantly.</p>
        <p>Recently, the view has been bleak. AT&amp;T's shares have lost almost 37 percent of their value this year, closing yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $32.125, up $1, and not much above a 52-week low of $29.625 reached intraday on Aug. 8.</p>
        <p>The sell-off has come as the company's core consumer long-distance business shrank more quickly than most analysts expected and the once-robust unit serving business customers also stumbled. At the same time, AT&amp;T's move to become the nation's No. 1 cable television provider has not been as successful as many investors had hoped.</p>
        <p>So now, with a market value around $121 billion, AT&amp;T is worth only somewhat more than the $96 billion it paid to acquire the cable giants Tele-Communications Inc. and the MediaOne Group.</p>
        <p>Based on the individual value of each of AT&amp;T's operations, including the consumer and business services units, as well as the wireless holdings, AT&amp;T's top executives and board members believe that the company is worth $225 billion to $300 billion, a person close to the company said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The most vocal proponent for change has perhaps been Mr. Malone, the former chairman of TCI and an AT&amp;T board member. Mr. Malone, whose stake in AT&amp;T has declined in value by $1 billion during the stock's slide, has said that AT&amp;T is trying to do too many things at once.</p>
        <p>A person close to Liberty Media, Mr. Malone's television programming operation, said yesterday that he was not seriously entertaining the idea of trying to acquire all of AT&amp;T. For one thing, Liberty Media, which trades as an AT&amp;T tracking stock, cannot issue additional shares without AT&amp;T's approval, according to a person close to AT&amp;T. Even if Liberty Media is spun off, a takeover of the parent company is not in Mr. Malone's current plans, the person close to Liberty said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Malone could still play a major role in a remaking of AT&amp;T, and not just as a board member.</p>
        <p>One of the more intriguing options on the table is for a Malone-led leveraged buyout of the consumer long-distance operations. That business, which made AT&amp;T the giant it is today, is now shrinking amid ruthless price wars and the entry of huge regional Bell companies into the long-distance arena.</p>
        <p>Yet long-distance service generates rafts of cash. This year, the unit will probably produce about $8 billion in cash flow -- or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, on perhaps $20 billion of revenue.</p>
        <p>In any potential sale, a Wall Street analyst said yesterday that the consumer unit would probably not fetch more than twice those earnings, or $16 billion. And, in any case, the unit's cash flow could easily support a significant debt load. Mr. Malone, known as a financial wizard, would almost surely be able to put together the necessary financing, if he so chose.</p>
        <p>A person close to AT&amp;T's continuing deliberations cautioned, however, that for now the leveraged-buyout option did not appear any more likely than any of the others under consideration.</p>
