        <p>The News Corporation said yesterday that after-tax profit for the company's fourth quarter fell 14 percent. Profit before extraordinary items was $184 million, or 18 cents per American depository receipt, compared with $214 million, or 21 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Revenue in the quarter, which ended June 30, rose 18 percent, to $3.9 billion.</p>
        <p>The company reported earnings of 6 cents an A.D.R. after all extraordinary items, in contrast to a loss of 2 cents a year earlier. The losses from extraordinary items were largely attributable to the rollout of digital services of the News Corporation's satellite television company British Sky Broadcasting.</p>
        <p>The results were slightly better than analysts' recent expectations of 16 cents a share. But they were below the forecasts that came before the impact of dismal box-office sales of  ''Titan A.E.,'' Fox studio's animated science fiction movie, was assessed.</p>
        <p>At a divisional level, the company was most severely affected by an operating loss of $53 million in the filmed entertainment division, in contrast to operating income of $22 million in the period a year earlier.  Like several other studios, Fox had raced into the animation business, setting up its own studio. The unit took a $12 million charge related to shutting the studio down.</p>
        <p>The largest improvement at the company was in the newspaper division, where profits rose more than 50 percent, to $161 million from $107 million a year earlier</p>
        <p>Even though the Fox television network has suffered from a decline in ratings, cash flow at the News Corporation's United States TV operations rose 4 percent. Expenses rose because of series cancellations, the broadcast of additional Major League Baseball games and generally higher costs for new programming, but increased sales of prime time ads helped raise the unit's operating income.</p>
        <p>The News Corporation's A.D.R.'s fell 18.75 cents to close at $51.25</p>
        <p>The company has just agreed to acquire Chris-Craft Industries for $3.5 billion in stock and cash. The Chris-Craft Television stations carry the UPN network, which is owned by Viacom.. UPN's contract with the stations is up next year, and Viacom could shut the network down. But Rupert Murdoch, who controls the News Corporation, said yesterday that he was open to negotiating with Viacom about the network's future on Chris-Craft stations.</p>
