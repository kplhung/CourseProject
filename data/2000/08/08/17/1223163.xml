        <p>The New York City Economic Development Corporation said yesterday that it was seeking proposals from private developers for three sites on the campus of the Queens Hospital Center that are to become surplus property when reconstruction is completed next year.</p>
        <p>The development proposals would have to be ''compatible with and complementary to'' the municipal hospital in Jamaica, the agency said, giving as examples private medical offices, biomedical research laboratories, assisted-living apartments for the elderly and day care centers.</p>
        <p>A $147 million, 200-bed hospital is under construction on the 20-acre campus, at Grand Central Parkway and 164th Street in Jamaica. It will replace the existing hospital buildings, which are to be demolished after patients move into the new building. The site of the old buildings is one of the three that will be available for redevelopment.</p>
        <p>Another is a part of the main parking area, which is considered larger than needed.</p>
        <p>The third is a 10-story building, originally meant for tuberculosis patients, that the city would like to see converted to an assisted-living complex. In recent years the building has been used for other hospital functions, which are to be moved to the new building, said Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corporation. The agency described the building as a ''striking example of 1930's period architecture with large windows, extended solariums and open sun decks.''</p>
        <p>The city would prefer that the sites be redeveloped under long-term  leases of up to 99 years, but it will  consider proposals to buy the sites.  The deadline for the submission of proposals is Oct. 31. The agency said it was arranging an information meeting for prospective developers and a visit to the site on Sept. 7. The  detailed request for proposals is available by calling the agency at (212) 312-3969.</p>
        <p>The Queens Hospital Center was one of several municipal hospitals that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani spoke of selling early in his administration, to get the city out of the hospital business. None of the hospitals have been sold, for reasons that include legal challenges.</p>
        <p>But the request for redevelopment proposals at the Queens Hospital Center makes it clear that the mayor has not given up on some form of privatization there. Michael G. Carey, president of the Economic Development Corporation, said yesterday that ''by offering this surplus property for development, we are once again promoting the Giuliani  administration's priority of transforming underused city properties into valuable assets.''</p>
