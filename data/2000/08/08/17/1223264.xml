        <p>Russian naval forces failed again today to dock a rescue vehicle onto the sunken and disabled submarine Kursk as President Vladimir V. Putin ordered his military commanders to accept Western offers of assistance.</p>
        <p>No signal was heard during the day from the 118 crew members, and hopes were fading that any of them would be able to cling to life as high winds and stormy weather hindered rescue efforts in the Barents Sea.</p>
        <p>Britain loaded a rescue submarine into a Russian transport jet this afternoon and flew it to Norway, from where it was to be sent to the rescue site, which is some 35 miles off the Kola Peninsula, where Russia's Northern Fleet is based. The Russians may be counting on the British submersible vessel to be more maneuverable in the harsh tides and more adaptable in its docking mechanisms.</p>
        <p>At the scene, 22 Russian vessels were hovering in wind-tossed seas over the heavily damaged and partially flooded hull of the Kursk, trapped since the weekend 350 feet below the surface. Norway said Russia had asked for divers and possibly additional ships to help.</p>
        <p>But it seemed unlikely that foreign experts could join the operation before midday Saturday, and that is a day beyond the deadline when the crew is likely to be out of breathable air, according to the estimate made by the commander of the Russian Navy, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov.</p>
        <p>Russian Navy officials acknowledged in interviews today that most of the crew may have perished in the first hours of the disaster, when an explosion apparently ripped through the forward compartment of the submarine, sending the 14,000-ton vessel crashing into the seabed, where it rolled to one side.</p>
        <p>On Monday and Tuesday, according to Russian officials, crew members had been banging on the hull, but they said such signals grew more faint on Tuesday and stopped today.</p>
        <p>The Kursk was taking part in large-scale naval maneuvers last weekend when an underwater explosion was detected by both Russian surface warships and American and Norwegian intelligence sensors monitoring the exercises. A contingent of senior Northern Fleet officers was aboard the Kursk, a navy spokesman said, and may have died on the bridge along with the submarine's captain, Gennadi Lyachin, 45. Navy officials initially reported the crew size at 116, but said today that 118 officers and crew members were aboard.</p>
        <p>In Washington, a United States defense official said two enormous explosions in close succession were detected on the Kursk last weekend in the forward compartments at a time when a torpedo-firing exercise may have been under way.</p>
        <p>''We had a pretty good indication of how powerful those explosions were,'' the official said, adding, ''the magnitude was extraordinary'' and would be consistent with torpedo blasts.</p>
        <p>He said that there was no evidence the Kursk was involved in a collision and that, based on United States estimates, some members of the crew in the aft sections may have survived.</p>
        <p>Russian Navy officials confirmed today that the Oscar II class submarine had been equipped with an escape module built into the conning tower, also known as the sail, and that the module was designed to separate from the submarine with explosive charges and float the entire crew to the surface.</p>
        <p>However, Russian officials said that apparent damage to the sail area and possible flooding of the bridge and the compartment under the sail area may have made access to the escape module impossible.</p>
        <p>Still, most Russian Navy officials expressed the conviction that some crew members remain alive. ''I don't think the absence of a signal means that all of them are dead,'' said Rear Adm. Georgi G. Kostov, 72, a longtime commander of nuclear attack submarines and an instructor at Russia's naval academy. ''What it means is that people are in a sort of dormant, sleepy state and they can hold on if they had time to put on warm clothing in the unflooded compartments.''</p>
        <p>But he added: ''I think they are very cold. They have food, they have some lighting. And the oxygen is running out with every hour.''</p>
        <p>President Putin, vacationing at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, characterized the plight of the crew as ''difficult, and I would say, critical.'' He spoke by telephone with President Clinton for 25 minutes during the day. Mr. Clinton reiterated an offer of assistance, and Mr. Putin said he was ''actively considering'' such offers, an administration official said in Washington.</p>
        <p>Shortly thereafter, Britain and Norway said they had received clearance from Russian military authorities to join the rescue effort. Mr. Putin's decision seemed aimed in part to dampen criticism that the military was not doing enough to save the crew.</p>
        <p>As the dramatic and dangerous rescue operation was pelted by driving rain and sleet, a navy spokesman said that by late afternoon today, small rescue submarines working in shifts had conducted four separate dives trying to dock on one of the hatches of the Kursk in hopes that the hatch could be opened and surviving crew members ferried to the surface. But strong currents, poor visibility and the treacherous angle of the submarine on the floor of the sea have frustrated every docking attempt, navy officials said.</p>
        <p>In each of the diving sessions, multiple attempts were made to maneuver the rescue vehicle into position. One vehicle was damaged during the day, officials said. The first dives on Tuesday also failed.</p>
        <p>''The whole day was spent on attempts to dock with the submarine,'' a navy spokesman, Igor Dygalo, said this evening. ''During the last 24 hours, rough seas and a strong northeast wind resulted more than once in danger of losing a rescue capsule.'' He added that in one diving session, a rescue vehicle successfully settled over the rear hatch of the Kursk, but then reported that its own batteries were running dangerously low and was recalled to the surface.</p>
        <p>The Northern Fleet spokesman, Igor Babenko, said docking attempts would continue through the night, but he added that ''given the fruitlessness of the attempts in the day and the worsening weather conditions, one cannot expect any results before Thursday morning.'' He added that the navy for now would continue pinning its hopes on completing a successful docking with the Kursk using the small rescue submarines and added that navy officials would delay other contingency plans, such as trying to float the stern section of the submarine near to the surface using huge pontoons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babenko reiterated earlier estimates that ''the stores of oxygen on the submarine are sufficient for the crew members to move unaided and maintain physical functions for two more days.''</p>
        <p>Storm conditions in the Barents Sea were forecast to abate somewhat in the next two days.</p>
        <p>Among the least understood aspects of the disaster were the reports of major structural damage to the submarine beyond the destruction in the forward compartment.</p>
        <p>Admiral Kuroyedov, the navy commander, said the first examination of the hull of Kursk showed portions of deck housing torn away. ''The submarine lies aground with a raised periscope,'' he added, indicating, some experts said, that the central section of the submarine was flooded. Other navy officials said the conning tower was heavily damaged. Some officials said it was still possible the submarine struck a World War II vintage mine, or was involved in a collision.</p>
        <p>''The causes of the accident will become clear following a detailed examination of the entire submarine body,'' the navy commander said. And as for the crew, he added, ''We shall remain optimistic until Aug. 18.''</p>
