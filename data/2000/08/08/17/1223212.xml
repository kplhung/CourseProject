        <p>On their first full day in South Korea after half a century, 100 North Koreans -- in two controlled groups of 50 -- experienced the capitalistic excess of a giant shopping mall today.</p>
        <p>Flanked by a marching band playing a rousing rendition of ''Our Hope Is Unification'' -- an emotional song well known to both North and South Koreans -- the visitors, who were in town to see relatives, walked under a five-story clock encrusted with stained glass and through the stainless steel gates of Lotte World. A 29-acre site, it has a 533-room hotel, an amusement park, three shopping centers, an indoor golf course and one of Asia's largest duty-free shops.</p>
        <p>Not that they were allowed a chance to stop and shop at any of the glitzy stores. The group was whisked up three flights of stairs into a dimly lit folk museum that features miniature exhibits of scenes from 5,000 years of Korean history, with the notable exception of the war that split the country in two.</p>
        <p>Spying the visitors as they filed by, Jeon Ok Im, a clerk at a women's clothing store, ran out into the main corridor.</p>
        <p>''It would have been great if they could have come to see the stores,'' Ms. Jeon said. ''But I guess they wouldn't have been able to control them. The atmosphere would have been too free.''</p>
        <p>The reunions are intended as a first step down the long road toward reunification of the Korean Peninsula. But their ground rules, rising out of five decades of hostility and mistrust, make normality impossible.</p>
        <p>To begin with, the North Koreans who flew here Tuesday are staying in a hotel on one side of the Han River, while the Southern relatives they have not seen since the Korean War are in a hotel on the other side.</p>
        <p>The shopping mall trip gave further evidence of official orchestration and control. The North Korean visitors were hustled onto buses and ferried to Lotte World like tourists, when they might have preferred to spend the entire day with their families. Fifty trekked through the mall in the morning while the other 50 stayed back at their hotel to see relatives. In the afternoon the groups traded itineraries.</p>
        <p>In North Korea, 100 South Koreans visiting their relatives were apparently being subjected to a similarly rigid routine.</p>
        <p>South Korean officials chose Lotte World as the site for the tour not to give them a lesson in free-market economics but because it is close to the North Koreans' hotel.</p>
        <p>''The schedule is very tight and they have to move around in groups,'' said a Unification Ministry spokesman, Kim Hyon Du. ''If they were to go out further, the round trip could run up to four or five hours.''</p>
        <p>He said North Korean government officials who visited Seoul earlier this year had gone on the same tour, which gave South Korean officials experience and eased the logistical difficulties of the outing.</p>
        <p>Despite the mall's capitalist vibrancy, the North Koreans were reserved, visibly mindful of the North Korean officials who were their ever-present escorts, often holding their hands as they walked along.</p>
        <p>But neither the minders nor the South Korean organizers anticipated the arrival of Oh Soon Kyun and her daughter. Holding a sign marked with the name of Mrs. Oh's North Korean brother-in-law, Kim Gyu Sol, they showed up at Lotte World determined to greet him.</p>
        <p>The South Korean government is allowing only five South Korean relatives to meet with each North Korean visitor, and Mrs. Oh and her daughter did not make the cut.</p>
        <p>For a brief moment, Mrs. Oh and Mr. Kim embraced. With tears glazing their faces, they whispered a few words to each other. But then Mr. Kim pulled away, saying, ''I have to go now,'' and rejoined the tour group.</p>
        <p>(Mrs. Oh and her daughter were not the only people to try this means of glimpsing long-lost relatives. At least one similar incident occurred, during the afternoon mall visit.)</p>
        <p>Inside the folk museum, Mr. Kim and the other North Koreans began a miniature journey through the history of their nation, starting with scenes of Stone-Age ancestors hunting for food. It was impossible to know whether the dioramas brought to mind the food shortages in their  country. Everyone involved in the exchange has been warned not to discuss matters relating to living conditions in North Korea.</p>
        <p>The North Koreans moved past the exhibits, their faces fixed in polite expressions that showed little awe or envy of the palaces and intricate historical tributes that their Southern counterparts had built since the end of the war.</p>
        <p>''I've already seen things like this before,'' said Moon Yang Ok, 67, who came to visit her younger sister in Seoul. ''We have these exhibits, too.''</p>
        <p>Ri Rok Won, 59, said they reminded him of childhood in the South. ''I saw the real thing on a school trip a long time ago,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But, pressed to give his impression of Seoul, he tapped on his ear, glancing at his North Korean escort. ''His hearing is not good,'' his escort said.</p>
        <p>Ri Don, 82, was more candid. He said the 20-minute bus ride from the hotel to the shopping mall had been a bit nerve-racking.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad we didn't get in a car accident,'' he said. ''There are so many cars!''</p>
        <p>But he added that the warm smiles and welcomes from the people on the streets made up for the congestion.</p>
        <p>Pak Sang Op, 68, said the Seoul he remembered from 50 years ago seemed to have deteriorated.</p>
        <p>''The Han River is the same, but it became a lot murkier,'' he said. ''The city is just too crowded and doesn't have the freshness it used to.''</p>
        <p>Jo Jyu Gyong, 68, had a different reaction. ''I'd like to go back to my old campus someday,'' he mused. Now a celebrated scholar, accorded the title ''people's scientist'' by Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea, Mr. Jo graduated from the prestigious Seoul National University.</p>
        <p>He said his mother had put him through college working as a peddler. During the war he volunteered to serve in the North Korean Army; afterward he never returned home.</p>
        <p>The museum tour ended with dioramas of open-air markets and palaces from the 18th century, and then the visitors watched a short multimedia presentation on a major 16th-century naval battle in which the Koreans defeated the Japanese.</p>
        <p>''We share the same history,'' Mr. Pak mused. ''Unification will lead to more glorious progress.''</p>
        <p>The North Koreans seem more convinced of the potential for reunification than some Southerners who observed their mall outing. Lee Jin Kyu, a retired office worker sitting outside the mall and watching all the hubbub, was somewhat skeptical.</p>
        <p>''All of the North Koreans seem to be saying 'Great Leader this' and Great Leader that,' '' Mr. Lee said. ''I sincerely hope that the two Koreas will soon become one. But it will be difficult if they keep on saying things like that.''</p>
