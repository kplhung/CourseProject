        <p>Union representatives for nearly two-thirds of striking Verizon Communications workers say they will break off negotiations if they do not reach agreement with company by midnight Aug 18 (M)</p>

        <p>In a development that could drastically change the direction of a 12-day walkout by more than 86,000 employees of Verizon Communications, representatives for nearly two-thirds of the striking workers said yesterday that they would break off negotiations if they did not reach an agreement with the company by midnight tonight.</p>
        <p>The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 14,000 striking employees, mostly in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the New England states, and the northern unit of the Communications Workers of America, which represents about 38,000 employees in New York and parts of New England, made the statement late yesterday.</p>

        <p>In a development that could drastically change the direction of a 12-day walkout by more than 86,000 employees of Verizon Communications, representatives for nearly two-thirds of the striking workers said yesterday that they would break off negotiations if they did not reach an agreement with the company by midnight tonight.</p>
        <p>The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents about 14,000 striking employees, mostly in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the New England states, and the northern unit of the Communications Workers of America, which represents about 38,000 employees in New York and parts of New England, made the statement late yesterday.</p>
        <p>The threat to withdraw from the negotiations clearly puts pressure on Verizon, which is trying to handle a growing number of requests for repair and new service from customers, to reach an agreement that deals with the unions' concerns over issues including workplace stress and job security.</p>
        <p>And it also puts pressure on a bargaining unit from the communications workers' union that represents about 34,000 workers in several mid-Atlantic states, which is thought to be holding up the talks out of intransigence over several issues, people close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>Yet at least in public, the unions put the pressure on Verizon, the telephone giant formed recently by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the GTE Corporation. In a message sent to local presidents in New York yesterday, the union said a proposal from Verizon yesterday dealing with the movement of jobs resulting from the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger fell short of expectations.</p>
        <p>''The company still refuses to abandon its position that the percentage of jobs moved should be calculated on a net basis, with incoming jobs counted as offsetting any jobs moved out, no matter what craft is affected,'' the message read. ''In addition, the company's position on the overall percentage of jobs that can be moved remains unacceptably high.''</p>
        <p>The electrical workers' union, for its part, is thought to be upset that an agreement reached last week making it easier to organize in Verizon's wireless division might not go far enough, a person close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>For instance, the union is not sure whether the agreement will allow organizing in New Jersey with card check, a process in which a majority of employees at a given work site can join a union by signing cards instead of going through a long and bureaucratic election process, a person close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>Verizon said it would try to address these issues, and others, before the midnight deadline. ''We all want to get this done quickly, as it seems the two groups are tired like us and want this to end,'' said Eric Rabe, Verizon's spokesman. ''Maybe they're trying to send the remaining bargaining party a message.''</p>
        <p>The bargaining unit that did not say it would break off talks by midnight is more concerned with issues involving mandatory overtime because more of its members work as customer service representatives. The unit is led by Vincent Maisano, a vice president of the communications workers' union, and has members in a region stretching from New Jersey to Virginia.</p>
        <p>Verizon is having a harder time negotiating with Mr. Maisano's unit because of the mandatory overtime issue, a person close to the talks said. Mr. Maisano was not immediately available for comment last night.</p>
        <p>Officially, the unions said they were working together to resolve the strike. ''Employers are known for trying to drive wedges in between our parts,'' said Jeff Miller, a spokesman for the communications workers' union.</p>
        <p>Negotiations were expected to last through the night in an effort to clear up remaining issues. In the meantime, it has become clear that Verizon is falling behind in attending requests for repair and the installation of new telephone service. The company said it had about 90,000 requests for repair yesterday, about a third more than normal.</p>
        <p>Cheri Grand-Anderman was among customers waiting for repairs after her high-speed Internet access was knocked out 10 days ago when vandals cut an access line near her Greenwich Village apartment.</p>
        <p>''It's been exasperating; I feel like I've been slapped in the face by Verizon,'' said Ms. Grand-Anderman, 31, who runs a public relations company from her home. ''They haven't been the least bit responsive in all my attempts to get my line repaired, even after I told them I was losing thousands of dollars in business.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Grand-Anderman said she would sign up with Verizon's competitors for her telecommunications needs, which include long-distance and high-speed Internet services.</p>
