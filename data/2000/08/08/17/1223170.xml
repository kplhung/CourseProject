        <p>The union representing New York City hospital security officers sued the city yesterday, claiming that the mayor has decided to replace them with private security guards in retaliation for their asking the State Legislature for permission to carry guns on the job.</p>
        <p>James L. Linsey, the union's lawyer, said the decision to replace the officers was the latest stage in the long-running battle over allowing hospital security officers to carry guns. The union says that city officials, including Luis Marcos, president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, decided to replace the security officers after they repeatedly petitioned the Legislature for the legal authority to carry guns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Linsey said that the officers' decision to appeal to legislators was protected by the First Amendment, and that the city's decision to replace the officers was unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>''These city employees have the right to bring that issue to their government representatives,'' Mr. Linsey said. ''And the Giuliani administration and president Marcos don't have a right to fire people for doing that.''</p>
        <p>Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said yesterday that there was no connection between the officers' appeal to the Legislature and the decision to turn to private hands.</p>
        <p>A Health and Hospitals Corporation spokeswoman said the agency believed that $10 million could be saved each year by replacing the city officers that now guard its 20 hospitals with private employees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Linsey said that on June 30 the city's Office of Labor Relations sent formal notice to the union representing all 850 hospital security officers  that the city intended to replace the officers with contract workers. He said the city had already accepted bids from private companies.</p>
        <p>The union is asking a federal judge to issue an order preventing the city from going forward with the planned dismissals. Mr. Linsey said that if the city went ahead with the plan, the union would also ask for money damages.</p>
        <p>Hospital security officers have sought permission to carry weapons for at least 10 years, and the proposal has been opposed by both Mayor Giuliani and former Mayor David N. Dinkins. As a result of a compromise in 1993, Mr. Linsey said, the hospital officers were allowed to carry guns in Lincoln Hospital and in Kings County Hospital.</p>
        <p>Last year, the officers sought legislative authority to carry guns in all of the city's public hospitals. According to their legal papers, Mr. Marcos responded by saying the move would force the city to contract for services with companies whose officers did not carry guns. The Legislature approved the officers' proposal, but the governor vetoed the bill in December.</p>
        <p>The hospital security officers said the city had canceled their right to carry weapons in Lincoln Hospital and Kings County Hospital last year. They claim the cancellation came one day after officers appeared at a City Council hearing asking for permission to carry guns.</p>
