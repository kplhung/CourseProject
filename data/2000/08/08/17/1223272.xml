        <p>A man who the police suspect may have committed a string of violent Upper West Side break-ins was charged yesterday with trying to burglarize an apartment on West 95th Street. The break-ins, during which one couple was stabbed, another was bludgeoned with a flashlight and one man suffered a fractured skull, sent a wave of fear through the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Van Baskerville, 32, had no known address but had a record of arrests for burglary and for criminal trespass, the police said.</p>
        <p>''We are taking a very hard, close look at him in connection with the other burglary patterns that are occurring in the 24th Precinct,'' Capt. Robert A. Iovino said at a news conference.</p>
        <p>The precinct covers much of the Upper West Side from 86th Street to Cathedral Parkway.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baskerville was arrested about midnight Tuesday after he placed his hand through the locked gate of an apartment on West 95th Street, the police said. The residents of the apartment saw him and called the police.</p>
        <p>A police spokesman said he did not know if Mr. Baskerville was carrying a weapon or a flashlight.</p>
        <p>The first of the eight break-ins that fit the pattern happened on June 25 at 5:45 a.m. All eight occurred in ground floor or basement apartments, the police said, and in most cases the intruder entered through an open door or window in the early morning.</p>
