        <p>THE centerpiece on the table was a humble ceramic head of lettuce, just as Sister Parish, the grande dame of American decor, had placed it there decades ago. But on a recent afternoon, as the summer clouds finally parted to allow in the buttery northern sunshine, everything else in the room was on the brink of commotion. The chintz was about to hit the fan.</p>
        <p>''We're going to squish 26 people into this room,'' said Apple Parish Bartlett, the owner of the house, where her illustrious mother had spent nearly all of her 84 summers. ''We'll just shuffle things around a little. Then we'll put it back, inch by inch.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bartlett, 66, is a painter and dealer in decorative furnishings, but the coming occasion was a dinner to celebrate the publication of ''Sister: The Life of Legendary American Interior Decorator Mrs. Henry Parish II'' (St. Martin's Press), by Ms. Bartlett and her daughter Susan Bartlett Crater. The book is a loving oral biography of Sister Parish, Ms. Bartlett's mother, who shaped the domestic aesthetic of various Kennedys, Astors, Paleys and Whitneys, until her death in 1994. The invited guests for the party included the staff of Parish-Hadley, the upper-crust New York firm formed by Mrs. Parish and the Tennessee-born decorator Albert Hadley (it closed last year). By any measure, this was going to be a tough crowd.</p>
        <p>Outside, shutters lay on the rolling lawn, awaiting a new coat of paint. But inside, what to do? The clutter of this old Maine house -- ceramic parrots, carved wooden dogs, embroidered pillows sprawled on mattress-ticking upholstery, flags and quilts everywhere -- was just the sort of froufrou over which the supertraditional Mrs. Parish and the modern Mr. Hadley had not seen eye to steely eye. She loved it, he did not, and this difference was a key to their creative partnership, the yin and yang of it. Here in Dark Harbor, the centripetal force of Mrs. Parish whirled unchecked.</p>
        <p>Stuff was everywhere. Ms. Bartlett saw no need to do anything drastic about it. ''Oh, it always looks like this,'' she said, smiling at the bold clash of orange print wallpaper and raspberry-colored flooring (evidently from the high-Yankee psychedelic era). ''How do you improve upon perfection?''</p>
        <p>The Summer House, as it is known in family circles, is an unpretentious clapboard ranch house on a gentle waterfront slope. Ms. Bartlett, who is divorced, lives here until the season turns, when she moves to the Winter House, just down the hill. The Summer House was the center of Mrs. Parish's world, the exemplar of generational continuity she stressed in her work. In 1967, House &amp; Garden magazine ran spreads of the house, bursting with wicker and needlepoint and other crafts. Seldom had old-fashioned looked so revolutionary. ''This was where the whole American country style started,'' Ms. Crater said, repeating a truism of decor  lore. From her mouth to Martha Stewart's ear.</p>
        <p>On this day, Ms. Crater and Ms. Bartlett pondered an often-reported family legend. Did Mrs. Parish really swat a young Caroline Kennedy, precipitating a split between the decorator and her most illustrious client? ''I don't know how it got started,'' Ms. Bartlett said. In fact, the story appears in their book, in an excerpt from Mrs. Parish's journal. ''But we wouldn't want to get into that whole thing,'' said Ms. Crater,  an artist. The girl ''probably had her feet up on the sofa, and Sister probably swatted them away. That would not have been beyond belief at all.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bartlett laughed knowingly. ''In a funny way,'' she said, Mrs. Parish ''was just imperious.''</p>
        <p>Dorothy ''Sister'' Parish was for the last half of the 20th Century the queen of American decoration, reigning over three generations of design luminaries, including Mark Hampton, Keith Irvine, Bunny Williams and Mario Buatta. Her influence trickled down to Ralph Lauren and Martha Stewart. If you have a quilt, you probably owe it to Mrs. Parish.</p>
        <p>Decorating is a hand-holding business, and Mrs. Parish held some regal hands, from Babe Paley's to Betsey Whitney's. She nearly decorated for real royalty, too. But anti-American outrage -- and her high prices -- prevented her from decorating the home of the Duke and Duchess of York.</p>
        <p>Born into the Eastern establishment -- her father was Edith Wharton's doctor -- Sister Parish used her fierce eye, strong ego and social connections to impose her generous, florid, unpretentious vision on a  country shaking off the chill of Victorian stuffiness in the postwar years. Her vision included chintz and plenty of it, often in bewildering, unmatched plenty. Mrs. Parish, her daughter said, did not go in for ''matchy-matchy.''</p>
        <p>A word here about names. Apple was born May Appleton Parish. Sister was the nickname given to a young Dorothy May Kinnicutt by her three brothers. The sobriquet lent itself to occasional odd constructions, like ''my aunt Sister,'' as well as to misunderstandings: when Jacqueline Kennedy tapped Mrs. Parish to spiff up the living quarters on Pennsylvania Avenue, Ms. Bartlett said, one newspaper reported that a nun was redecorating the White House.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bartlett and Ms. Crater said they intended their book to be a social history, capturing the milieu of Murray Hill and Dark Harbor and other closed social worlds before the democratic creep of post-1960's modernity, to say nothing of gazillionaire rock stars and dot-commers, penetrated the blueblood walls. Constructed in the manner of Jean Stein and George Plimpton's ''Edie,'' with blocks of quotations from friends and relatives alternating with excerpts from Mrs. Parish's journal, the book is a portrait of society without the John O'Hara elements: no drinking, no adultery, no bad behavior. And no dollar figures. ''We weren't interested in that next level of psycho-biography,'' Ms. Crater said.</p>
        <p>They gloss delicately over a level of high-decor bloodshed, including battles over the Kennedy White House, the commission that so raised  Mrs. Parish's profile. James Abbott, author of ''Designing Camelot: The Kennedy White House Restoration,'' said that shortly into Mrs. Parish's endeavors, Mrs. Kennedy asked others, including the Parisian decorator Stephane Boudin, to revise the rooms. ''A number of times, Sister Parish threatened to quit,'' he continued, adding that Mrs. Parish ultimately obtained permission to take credit for one of Mr. Boudin's window treatments.</p>
        <p>Such battles come with the territory, and with the fickle clients who rule it, said the decorator Mario Buatta, who was devoted to Mrs. Parish. ''Those women weren't going to be faithful to you,'' Mr. Buatta continued. ''I remember she called one client and said, 'It's going to kill my husband if you let someone else do that room.' She was very controlling. You had to be.''</p>
        <p>The excerpts from Mrs. Parish's journals reveal a more subtle form of manipulation, the art behind the decorator's art. She stressed the need to please husbands, who commonly paid the (often stratospheric) bills. ''We did the largest, most elaborate job in San Francisco for the Gettys, and Mr. Getty's sole interest was the piano. We paid a great deal of attention to the acoustics in the music room, and everything else just fell into place beautifully,'' she wrote, adding that once a decorator reels in the husband, ''he becomes eager to keep going.'' And at that point, she concluded, ''you've won.''</p>
        <p>The book also offers a glimpse of an insular world that was receding even as Mrs. Parish was triumphing in it. It's a window treatment on history. As Mr. Hadley remembers his introduction to the Kennedy White House: ''The first time I went there, the yellow room was being done. The day we went was the day of the Bay of Pigs invasion.''</p>
        <p>The Dark Harbor house stands just as it did in Mrs. Parish's day, give or take a few new photographs and the odd crack in the walls. In the master bedroom is the canopied bed on which she was born, and on which she died. ''People can't believe that I sleep in the bed someone died in,'' said Ms. Crater, who was in the middle of a six-week visit. ''I don't think that's a strange thing.''</p>
        <p>As part of their research, Ms. Crater and her mother scoured the family dressers and attics. They found letters from Edith Wharton. They found recipes. ''She kept every one,'' Ms. Crater said, ''and she was not a cook. We found one that said, 'Rice: Put water in pot. Put rice in water. Boil.' ''</p>
        <p>Social histories are usually told after the fall, and the influence of Mrs. Parish has waned, eroded on one side by the mass merchandizing of Americana and on the other by the triumph of high-end modernism. The chintz, like the Social Register set that championed it, has lost some of its glaze. ''The clients were different then,'' Ms. Crater said of her grandmother's 1960's heyday. ''Now, a lot of people want to look rich, they want everybody to notice where they are in the world. The Whitneys and the Paleys and that crowd, they weren't proving that.''</p>
        <p>In Dark Harbor, though, Mrs. Parish's influence still rules the homey sprawl. These days, Ms. Bartlett finds her greatest happiness in yard sales. She described a trip to the local dump, where she salvaged material from a discarded sofa. Her eagle-eyed mother would have been proud -- and might have grabbed some, too. And if the stories in ''Sister'' are any indication, she might have commanded a bundle for it.</p>
