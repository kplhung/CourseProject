        <p>As the first round of the Women's National Basketball Association playoffs was nearing an end for the Liberty, the team's improbable second-half run was about to snowball to 15 victories in 18 games. The players felt they had blown their cover.</p>
        <p>''I guess we're no longer the underdogs,'' the veteran Sue Wicks said.</p>
        <p>In dispatching their upstart rivals, the Washington Mystics, with only a moment's hesitation in two games, the Liberty proved why it was the regular-season Eastern Conference champion.</p>
        <p>It had won a trip to Cleveland for Thursday night's opener of the two-of-three Eastern Conference finals against the Rockers and, by virtue of playoff experience, if not record, should be favored once again.</p>
        <p>Some disagree. Nancy Lieberman-Cline, the coach of the Detroit Shock and a commentator for ESPN, said on television Tuesday night after the Rockers had eliminated the Orlando Miracle in the third game of their series that she could see Cleveland easily winning the first game of the conference finals in Gund Arena and then winning once in Madison Square Garden. The Liberty players and coaches, watching together, took it personally.</p>
        <p>After all, Lieberman-Cline also predicted that the Mystics would  sweep the Liberty. The team is using her words as ammunition.</p>
        <p>''It's funny to us to hear that,'' Wicks said. ''We have a tremendous will to win. We're all very confident in each other, we and we're playing our best basketball now.''</p>
        <p>Included in New York's final dominating stretch, when the Liberty finished the regular season at 13-3, were two double-digit victories over Cleveland in Madison Square Garden. The Rockers may be 15-3 in Gund Arena this season, but they are 4-13 away from it and the Liberty has the luxury of playing two games at home, if necessary.</p>
        <p>But in the opinion of forward Vickie Johnson, ''We're still the underdog.''</p>
        <p>She added, however, ''We always knew we could put it together.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the Liberty was the runner-up to Houston for the W.N.B.A title, but before this season began, the team lost center Kym Hampton to retirement, forward Rebecca Lobo to another knee rehabilitation, and played on the long-sacrificed legs of the captains Teresa Weatherspoon and Wicks.</p>
        <p>A 66-65 loss at Cleveland in overtime dropped the Liberty to 7-9 on July 3. At that point, the Liberty had no choice but to adopt the ''nobody gives us any credit'' theme, a familiar armor that the Liberty has employed for four years, with success, reaching the championship round twice.</p>
        <p>Whichever team from the East advances to the W.N.B.A. finals will surely be an underdog whether facing Houston, the three-time champions, or Los Angeles, which has lost only four times this season.</p>
        <p>New York's season began with the premise and promise to get back to the finals and ''finish business.'' Cleveland's season, conversely, began with the intent to re-establish business. Last season, the Rockers, under Coach Linda Hill-MacDonald, went 7-25. This year, with virtually the same players returning, but a new coach, Dan Hughes, who was the interim coach at Charlotte last season, the Rockers finished second in the conference.</p>
        <p>After losing the first game to Minnesota, on the road, Cleveland never again dipped below .500. What makes the Rockers' rebirth so remarkable is that they got there without their leading scorer, Eva Nemcova, whose season ended July 1, when she tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee.</p>
        <p>Younger players have filled in for Nemcova. Small forward Mery Andrade, an emotional, defensive leader, has improved her shooting. The rookie point guard Helen Darling,  Ann Wauters, the center from Belgium, and forward Rushia Brown have emerged this year.</p>
        <p>''In a lot of spots, we're a young team,'' Hughes said. ''But we are more complete as a team than individuals.''</p>
        <p>The two-time Olympian Suzie McConnell Serio, 35, who announced she would retire at the end of the season, solidifies this team.Merlakia Jones, the team's lone All-Star, leads the club in scoring with a 13.3 point average. Against New York this season, Jones is the only player averaging double figures, 14.3 points in the three games.</p>
        <p>''It will be a tough battle for us,'' Jones admitted. ''They have that physical dogged mentality.''</p>
