        <p>THERE are as many ways to bill a client as there are designers and architects. The confusion arises when the client doesn't know the real cost of things, whether bolts of fabric or a contractor's fee. Fabric, for instance, may have a list price for the public, and a net price that is 25 to 40 percent lower and that is available only to architects and designers.</p>
        <p>Ann Sonet, who is the publicist for the Donghia furniture and textiles company and who represented its founder, the late interior designer Angelo Donghia, recounted Mr. Donghia's rule about charging: ''Where there's mystery, there's distrust. There should only be one price, which is the net price. You make your money by charging a fee for your expertise and the design work.''</p>

        <p>THERE are as many ways to bill a client as there are designers and architects. The confusion arises when the client doesn't know the real cost of things, whether bolts of fabric or a contractor's fee. Fabric, for instance, may have a list price for the public, and a net price that is 25 to 40 percent lower and that is available only to architects and designers.</p>
        <p>Ann Sonet, who is the publicist for the Donghia furniture and textiles company and who represented its founder, the late interior designer Angelo Donghia, recounted Mr. Donghia's rule about charging: ''Where there's mystery, there's distrust. There should only be one price, which is the net price. You make your money by charging a fee for your expertise and the design work.''</p>
        <p>But the day of one price, with every showroom open to the public and all prices revealed, has not arrived. The happiest client is the one whose decorator or architect quotes the price that he has paid, along with the markup to the client.</p>
        <p>Antiques present a special problem. When an antiques dealer buys something, ''he can mark it up any percentage,'' said Mario Buatta, the interior designer. He continued: ''If I go into an antiques shop, I get a discount between 20 and 25 percent, and I sell the antique at the price the antique dealer has written on it. If a desk is $10,000, I can't suddenly buy it at $10,000 and resell it for $80,000, because everybody has seen it as $10,000.''</p>
        <p>Here are billing approaches taken by six Manhattan architects, designers and shopping consultants.</p>
        <p>Mario Buatta: For furniture and fabrics, Mr. Buatta pays the discounted price, and the client pays either the list price, if the goods come from a showroom, or, for antiques, the retail price written on the tag. ''Go to Clarence House, the fabric showroom,'' he said. ''There's a list price of, say, $120 a yard. I pay $80, the client pays $120.''</p>
        <p>If any construction is to be done, Mr. Buatta gives the contractor's contract to the client, who pays the contractor directly. ''I charge 25 percent of whatever the contractor charges,'' Mr. Buatta said. ''It's too complicated any other way. All I have is the design and supervisory fee, which is the 25 percent.''</p>
        <p>For out-of-town construction, Mr. Buatta charges a day rate of $3,500 for occasional site visits, in addition to the fees already mentioned for fabrics and furniture. ''But then I don't get 25 percent of the contractor's fee,'' he said, ''because I'm not there to supervise it. They have to hire somebody else to supervise every day.''</p>
        <p>Jennifer Post, interior designer: Ms. Post charges a one-time fee, which is based on the cost of the entire project -- including furniture, fabric, lighting and construction -- and is set before the contract is signed. For furniture and fabrics, clients pay the net price. (Ms. Post pays with the clients' credit cards, keeping an itemized list.) ''I don't care if they buy a Crate &amp; Barrel couch, or spend millions of dollars where everything is custom,'' Ms. Post said.</p>
        <p>Alexander Gorlin, architect: For residential projects, Mr. Gorlin charges 15 to 18 percent of the construction cost, which includes appliances, custom cabinetwork, millwork and built-in lighting. For furniture, draperies, rugs and fabric, he charges the discounted, or net, price plus an hourly fee. ''They can see all the bills for the furniture, draperies and rugs,'' Mr. Gorlin said. The hourly fee ranges from $400 for Mr. Gorlin to $100 for a junior staff member.</p>
        <p>D'Aquino Monaco Inc.: Carl D'Aquino, an interior designer, and Francine Monaco, an architect, use several approaches. ''Our books are open,'' Mr. D'Aquino said. First, the client pays the net (or discounted) price for fabric and furniture to showrooms that accept the client's check. ''When a vendor won't accept a client's check directly, we create a purchase order that we pay, and the client reimburses us, knowing the exact fee,'' Mr. D'Aquino said. ''The clarity is that the client knows the exact price of each and every item they have.''</p>
        <p>Under the contract, the designers receive markups over net price, one for the furniture, another for construction.</p>
        <p>For clients who appear indecisive from the outset, the firm charges an hourly rate.  The client pays the net price for everything, plus an agreed-upon hourly fee that includes all work done by the firm, whether by the partners or a junior designer. ''This method of payment would be to our benefit,'' Mr. D'Aquino said. ''The designer is protected.''</p>
        <p>Finally, there is the flat fee, one lump sum for all the contracting, painting and furniture. This fee, specified in the contract, works best with the most decisive clients.</p>
        <p>The Decoration and Design Building: Most of the showrooms in the D&amp;D Building, 979 Third Avenue (58th Street), are open to the trade only. But for a client who wants to shop at the building, Charlotte Zaslav, who works for the D&amp;D management, will consult for $100 an hour and shop with the client in the building's showrooms, buying goods at the net price and charging a 15 percent commission. She can be reached at (212) 759-6894.</p>
        <p>Eleanor Windman, interior designer and purchasing agent: Some individual showrooms at the D&amp;D Building, like Donghia, might recommend someone like Ms. Windman, who will act as a purchasing agent, or shopper, for a client who lacks a designer or an architect. ''If they're hiring me as a purchasing agent, I'll charge them net price plus an additional 20 percent,'' Ms. Windman said.</p>
