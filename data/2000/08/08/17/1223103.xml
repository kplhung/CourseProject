        <p>There were virtually no surprises at the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals here on Tuesday. Thirty-two teams, including all the top-ranked squads, survived in the Spingold Knockout Team Championship, which will end on Sunday. Play began on Monday with 133 teams.</p>
        <p>There was one minor upset in the Women's Knockout Team Championship. The 5th seeded team, led by Hjordis Eythorsdottir, from Huntsville, Ala., lost by 8 imps to the 12th seeded group, headed by Jan Martel of Davis, Calif. These are the pairings by captain in the quarterfinal stage today:</p>
        <p>Martel vs. Joan Jackson of Dallas</p>
        <p>Connie Goldberg of Merion Station, Pa., vs. Beverly Rosenberg of Sherman Oaks, Calif.</p>
        <p>Kathie Wei-Sender of Nashville vs. Jean Hume of Livermore, Calif.</p>
        <p>Cheri Bjerkan of Elmhurst, Ill., vs. Lynn Baker of Austin, Tex.</p>
        <p>One of the contestants in the Spingold is the veteran star Sidney Lazard of New Orleans, who was inducted into the Bridge Hall of Fame here last Thursday. Almost half a century ago he was the hero of one the most remarkable deals in the history of the game, shown in the diagram.</p>
        <p>In a rubber bridge game for high stakes, he held the South cards and heard his right-hand opponent bid one club. He passed quietly and was not surprised when the response of one spade was passed by East. That player had a reputation for making psychic opening bids when holding a long suit and a weak hand. The pass made it obvious to the other players that the opening was psychic.</p>
        <p>In some difficulty, Lazard ventured two no-trump and heard three hearts on his left. It was now clear that West held a strong two-suiter, with at least 5-5 distribution. After considerable hesitation, East raised to four hearts.</p>
        <p>Lazard judged correctly that East was wondering whether to give preference to spades, and his likely distribution was 3-4-1-5. North had to have considerable length in diamonds, so South made a dramatic leap to six diamonds, one of the most imaginative bids ever made.</p>
        <p>Hearts were led, and South ruffed the second round with the ace. He cashed the king and led the nine to the jack, preserving a trump entry to the dummy. Ruffing dummy's remaining heart offered no hope of making 12 tricks, so Lazard led the club jack, forcing a cover with the queen.</p>
        <p>After winning with the king, South cashed three of dummy's trumps, forcing East to come down to a singleton spade in order to preserve sufficient club protection. South finessed in clubs, cashed the club ace and reached this ending:</p>
        <p>Diagram:</p>
        <p>The club eight was led, and West reluctantly gave up a spade. Lazard ruffed and scored the last trick with the spade three, completing a virtuoso performance.</p>
