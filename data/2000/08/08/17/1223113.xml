        <p>It really isn't spoiling anything to reveal the final lines of the two most recent plays by Alan Ayckbourn. They are, as a matter of fact, exactly the same, though spoken by different actors. And they are not concluding words that seem destined for immortality: ''Ah, well. That's life, I suppose.''</p>
        <p>Before you start fretting that the prolific Mr. Ayckbourn has at last depleted his wit, remember that in theater, as in life, context is everything. It's not just what's said that's important, but also when, where and how.</p>
        <p>When and where, in particular, have rarely counted for as much as they do in Mr. Ayckbourn's ''House'' and ''Garden,'' the joyful, mournful and intricately interrelated comedies directed by their author at the Royal National Theater. Mr. Ayckbourn wrote the plays concurrently in celebration of his 60th birthday, and they are being performed simultaneously -- at the same time by the same performers, who run between two different stages -- in what turns into an invigorating celebration of the possibilities of theater.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ayckbourn is a comic chronicler of suburban discontent whose technique is often as exotic as his subject matter is familiar. Here he stretches his imagination and his actors' stamina to render a single disastrous day as observed both within a country manor and in the garden just outside.</p>
        <p>''House'' and ''Garden'' are eminently enjoyable as individual pieces. To see them in succession, however (I did both in one day, and the sequence is immaterial), is a mind-flexing delight. Each play deeply enriches the other while teasingly reminding us that any view presented by a work of art is only partial. By the second time you reach that concluding shrug of a comment -- ''That's life, I suppose'' -- you may find that you have tears in your eyes because you know so much more than when you first heard it, spoken by somebody else.</p>
        <p>Who says the theater has reached a dead end? The current London season is filled with confirmations of how protean the discipline remains, as variable and potentially surprising as human beings themselves.</p>
        <p>Local observers may lament the Americanization of the London stage, with its adaptations of Hollywood movies and reliance on brand-name celebrities. But if you look past pandering hits like ''The Graduate,'' you'll discover an abiding, very British penchant for playing with plays, a delight in demonstrating what theater can do that other forms cannot.</p>
        <p>The sensibility is evident in everything from the blistering revival of Peter Nichols's ''Passion Play,'' a 1981 study of infidelity in which husband and wife are each played by two actors, to the Globe Theater's production of ''Hamlet,'' in which the soliloquies of the title character, played by Mark Rylance, sometimes turn into boisterous exchanges with the audience.</p>
        <p>Just what gives a show an audacious freshness can range from the use of actors to the choice of theater. The season's unexpected sleeper, and the one London production already assured of a Broadway transfer, is a hymn to actorly inventiveness: Marie Jones's ''Stones in His Pockets,'' in which two performers embody a baker's dozen of characters to tell the story of an Irish village invaded by a Hollywood production company.</p>
        <p>A 200-year-old comedy, Fanny Burney's ''Busy Day,'' finally makes its West End debut, with a smooth, canny interpretation that finds immediate accessibility through judicious exaggeration. And the summer's classiest glamour tickets have been the Almeida Theater's rotating productions of ''Richard II'' and ''Coriolanus,'' directed by Jonathan Kent and scheduled for a run at the Brooklyn Academy of Music this fall.</p>
        <p>That Ralph Fiennes plays both heroes obviously has much to do with their success. But it's important not to underestimate the impact of the setting: the cavernous, derelict Gainsborough movie studios in Islington, a mightily resonant backdrop for works dealing with the fragility of empire, smashingly exploited by Mr. Kent and his designer, Paul Brown.</p>
        <p>All of these shows benefit from what might be described as stunts or gimmicks. Well, of course. Gimmicks, as the singing strippers in the musical ''Gypsy'' so convincingly point out, are the essence of show business.</p>
        <p>There is a difference, however, between gimmicks that exist merely to capture crowds (like having a middle-aged movie star take off all her clothes) and those provided by Mr. Ayckbourn's current comedies, where what at first seems like just a clever gambit actually deepens your response to the productions.</p>
        <p>I'll confess that when I first saw Mr. Nichols's ''Passion Play,'' in a London production 15 years ago, I wasn't entirely convinced of the necessity of giving onstage alter egos to the main characters. Sure, there's duplicity involved in any marriage,  but isn't part of an actor's job to suggest layers of conflict?</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, this latest ''Passion Play,'' another product of the invaluable Donmar Warehouse, made me feel that I had missed the point the first time. Under Michael Grandage's gimlet-eyed direction, this minimalist production brings out the shattering core of Mr. Nichols's thesis: that adultery, as the straying husband in the play suggests in a semantic meditation, adulterates, fragmenting lives and polluting tranquillity.</p>
        <p>''Passion Play'' isn't just a matter of people saying one thing while thinking another. Mr. Nichols's manipulation of his divided characters is far more subtle, ultimately daring to suggest that one ''self'' is no more viable than another and that the inability to reconcile the two is genuinely tragic.</p>
        <p>This revelation grows in painful increments through the carefully graded performances of James Laurenson, Nicky Henson, Cherie Lunghi and Cheryl Campbell -- as the torn spouses -- and of Nicola Walker as the feckless young woman who comes between them. The crucifix patterns in Christopher Oram's stripped-down set and in Mr. Grandage's staging subliminally emphasize the religious agony of the title.</p>
        <p>The play has the hubris to offer Mozart's Requiem as a comment on an extramarital fling. But by the evening's end, the choice seems entirely justified, echoing D. H. Lawrence's contention that the cross is a symbol of how we are divided within ourselves. Like the National's production of a very different look at the corrupting effects of deception, Arthur Miller's ''All My Sons,'' this ''Passion Play'' leaves you flattened. And yet you know you wouldn't have missed it for anything.</p>
        <p>''Stones in His Pockets'' is, by comparison, a frolic. Ms. Jones's account of an American movie crew wreaking havoc in a County Kerry hamlet examines distorting cultural stereotypes in ways that tend to be stereotyped themselves, and it could definitely profit from editing.</p>
        <p>Certainly there's nothing new in the shallowness of the Hollywood visitors who condescendingly rule over the villagers who have signed on as extras. Nor is the somber history of a local suicide comfortably integrated into the evening's dominant balminess.</p>
        <p>Still, you're unlikely to stop smiling through most of the show for the simple reason that everyone, from a desperate drug addict to an excruciatingly earnest young movie goddess, is played by two remarkably nimble actors, Conleth Hill and Sean Campion. Ian McElhinney's direction capitalizes splendidly on the pleasure of watching these metamorphoses, especially when it concentrates on the blurred reality that sets in when Irish villagers play Hollywood's idea of Irish villagers.</p>
        <p>''Look at her look at us lookin' dispossessed,'' explains one extra to another, defining their job description for that day. Just how Mr. Campion and Mr. Hill register such levels of being, in ways that happily include a brutal ''Riverdance''-style sequence, is a giddy treat.</p>
        <p>The Globe Theater, which seeks to conjure the experience of watching plays in the days of Shakespeare, has drawn criticism for emphasizing crowd-pleasing accessibility over nuance. Yet it's this populist dimension that makes the Globe such fun.</p>
        <p>Its current ''Hamlet,'' directed by Giles Block, may not have the chic interpretive gloss of the Almeida's ''Coriolanus.'' It's a doggedly conventional rendering with generally pedestrian supporting performances. Yet it delivers its story with absorbing, fast-paced clarity. And in Mark Rylance, who is also the company's artistic director, it has a compelling Hamlet who wears both royalty and ambivalence as if they were a jester's motley. Mr. Rylance's prince, in feigning madness, is clearly caught up in the clownish, theatrical pleasures of the role; he is also repeatedly lanced with pain as he remembers the reality beneath the ruse.</p>
        <p>In emphasizing the showman in Hamlet, Mr. Rylance invites the audience to share in the character's monologues. When this Hamlet asks, ''Am I a coward?,'' it isn't just rhetorical. The groundlings standing at the edge of the stage are eager to answer him. Watching Mr. Rylance integrate such responses into his performance provides a thrilling suggestion of the theater of 400 years ago.</p>
        <p>The house, alas, appeared to be half empty the Friday I saw ''A Busy Day,'' the first West End production of the Regency comedy by the novelist Fanny Burney, best known today for her diaries and letters. This neglect by audiences is a shame and a surprise. As a literary curiosity, this story of romance and class conflict in a socially unsettled London is fascinating, anticipating many of the thematic threads more gently plied by Jane Austen.</p>
        <p>More crucially, the play, under Jonathan Church's direction, emerges as a fiendishly vivid parade of aristocrats and parvenus. The actors gleefully demonstrate that caricature can be a fine art, especially Ben Moor as a half-witted peacock of a lord and Stephanie Beacham (of ''Dynasty'' fame) as a gargoylish slave to snobbery.</p>
        <p>If the course of love is bumpy in Regency London, it seems to be no smoother in the contemporary English suburbs of ''House'' and ''Garden,'' where the chances of happy unions are devastatingly remote.</p>
        <p>These complementary works, which follow the events both indoors and out surrounding a misbegotten village fete, are notably different in tone. ''House'' is the more verbal and socially barbed play, as befits its interior setting, promisingly accented with French windows. The alfresco ''Garden'' has an appropriately bacchanalian flavor, with a firmer emphasis on physical comedy.</p>
        <p>As the plays anatomize three different souring marriages (as well as several other varieties of sexual relationships), a gentle melancholy rises above the comic fray, like the melodic solo in a flute concerto. With an ideally balanced ensemble led by David Haig and Jane Asher as the miserably married lord and lady of the manor, ''House'' and ''Garden'' find an illuminating common ground in their respective forms of farce.</p>
        <p>The denizens of ''House'' may be the more articulate lot, given to tidy metaphors that describe their plight. In ''Garden,'' the same characters are more likely to express themselves by wrestling or dancing or hiding in bushes. But in either play there's no avoiding Mr. Ayckbourn's insistence that communication between people is a pretty futile business.</p>
        <p>This is a play, after all, in which the most passionate and satisfactory relationship is between an Englishman and a Frenchwoman who can't speak each other's languages. Mr. Ayckbourn's vivaciously orchestrated scenes of slapstick and volleys of dialogue curiously add up to an existential sadness.</p>
        <p>Yet there is infinite curiosity and affection in his view of life's frustrations, and an infectiousness in the zest with which he shapes that perspective into not one, but two, works of theater. A warm, vital amusement, as well as a resigned fatalism, shine through that simple curtain line: ''Ah, well. That's life, I suppose.'' Isn't it a curse? And isn't it fun?</p>
