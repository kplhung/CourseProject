        <p>THERE are two excellent reasons to go Web surfing for the real thing. The first reason is if you live along the Southern California coast, or in Hawaii, or on the Outer Banks or anywhere else with wave action and you want to find out whether the surf's up and the sun's going to stay out.</p>
        <p>The other reason is if you live anywhere else, particularly if you are chained to a desk and wouldn't know a Hobie from a hoagie. In that case, you may need a surf site even more.</p>

        <p>THERE are two excellent reasons to go Web surfing for the real thing. The first reason is if you live along the Southern California coast, or in Hawaii, or on the Outer Banks or anywhere else with wave action and you want to find out whether the surf's up and the sun's going to stay out.</p>
        <p>The other reason is if you live anywhere else, particularly if you are chained to a desk and wouldn't know a Hobie from a hoagie. In that case, you may need a surf site even more.</p>
        <p>For those whose image of surfing remains fixated on the Beach Boys and ''Hawaii Five-O,'' it may come as a surprise that the sport is now a big business. It is all over the Web, and some sites evoke major advertising and venture capital as much as big kahunas and woodies.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, the aptly named Swell.com (www.swell.com), which has acquired or linked to many weather, tournament information, entertainment and merchandise sites and is promoting itself as being a kind of one-stop shop for all things surf when it expands later this summer. (Its slick online promotional video is worth the look.) One of its notable acquisitions is Surfline (surfline.swell.com), a forecasting service that provides surfing and weather information for dozens of spots, including 37 sites in California alone, 4 in Hawaii, 17 in Florida, 20 elsewhere on the East Coast and 3 from Costa Rica. Surfline says it has more than 350,000 visitors a month.</p>
        <p>There are wonderful Webcams on many of Surfline's beach links, so you do not have to trust the status reports; just look for yourself. Moreover, there is something about staring at a live color shot of the uncharacteristically low swells at the Pipeline on Oahu's North Shore (a result of La Nina, the page's ''local knowledge'' section explains) or a view of the three-to-five-foot surf at Guaruja, Brazil, from Midtown Manhattan that is at least as hypnotic as gazing into a lava lamp.</p>
        <p>The Hawaiian Lifeguard Association has its own site detailing the lifeguard-protected beaches of Oahu (www.aloha.com:80/lifeguards /hla.html). Besides the great pictures, there is a lot of advice that is short on surfer lingo and long on good sense: reminders about sharp coral, waves breaking on ledges and the need to respect high-surf warnings. There are separate pages titled Sharks of Hawaii and Dangerous Ocean Organisms.</p>
        <p>Times have definitely changed. The East Coast Wahine Championships (www.eastcoastwahines.com), an amateur contest for East Coast surfing women that began in 1997, was held Aug. 12 and 13 in Wrightsville Beach, N.C., blessed by California-size waves stirred up by Hurricane Alberto. There were short-board, long-board and bodyboard divisions and a beginners division. You can see photos of some of the competition on the Southern North Carolina Surf page (www.sncsurf.com). The United States Surfing Federation (www.ussurf.org) and Eastern Surfing Association (www.surfesa.org) have schedules on the major amateur events, including the Eastern Surfing Championships in late September in Avon, N.C.</p>
        <p>The Web site of the International Surfing Museum in Huntington Beach, Calif. (www.surfingmuseum .org), provides a nostalgic return to simple joys. There is a camera box belonging to Bruce Brown, director of the classic surfing documentary ''The Endless Summer,'' with its top that was painted by LeRoy Neiman on a trip to the beach. There are pictures of Corky Carroll, world champion in the 1960's, in his prime, and a quote from him today: ''Yes, I still surf all the time, and no, I still don't have a real job. Let's hope it never comes to that.'' There are plenty of pictures of Duke Kahanamoku, the Olympic swimming champion from Hawaii, and his 10-foot redwood board, with which he did more to popularize surfing than anyone until Hobie Alter, perfecter of the fiberglass board, and Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.</p>
        <p>The museum's online exhibits include an Irish surfing poster (County Sligo, 1984) and a surfboard used by the Swiss team (Swiss? Well, why not?) in an international 1992 championship.</p>
        <p>For sheer escapism, it is hard to do better than the Costa Rica Supersite (www.incostarica.net/docs/surf). Rent a four-wheel drive to get to the best places, it advises, because ''mud and rivers will become an important part of your journey, especially during the rainy season.'' There are plenty of links, including some to other Costa Rican surfing guides.</p>
        <p>Here is a partial description of Matapalo, on the Pacific Coast:  ''Best waves are a 15- to 25-minute walk through the forest trails, where monkeys, toucans, macaws and other tropical wonders can be spotted.''</p>
