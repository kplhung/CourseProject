        <p>Consumer inflation increased only slightly last month, the Labor Department said yesterday, reassuring analysts that the Federal Reserve would find no need to raise interest rates again when it meets Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Consumer Price Index rose a relatively modest 0.2 percent in July, as oil and other energy prices showed little change after gyrating for most of the year.</p>
        <p>''This puts the final nail in the coffin of a rate hike next week,'' said Bill Sharp, senior United States economist at Chase Securities.</p>
        <p>Adding to the case for Fed forbearance, the Commerce Department said that builders had broken ground on 3.3 percent fewer new homes last month than in June, the slowest pace since late 1997.</p>
        <p>The price report contained few surprises, but allayed lingering fears that the Fed, which has raised rates six times in the last 13 1/2 months, would be forced to keep raising them to prevent an outbreak of inflation. A report of strong retail sales last week had kept such fears alive. Not counting energy and food, the rise was 0.2 percent for the fourth consecutive month.</p>
        <p>The July results reduced the 12-month inflation rate to 3.5 percent from 3.7 percent.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, economists noted a gradual uptick in the pace of inflation this year that they said would need eventually to be arrested -- even though it largely results from higher prices for a volatile item like gasoline. Inflation increased at a 4 percent pace for the first seven months of the year, compared with a 2.7 percent pace for the 1999 calendar year.</p>
        <p>''We are seeing some inflation pressures,'' said Marilyn Schaja, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ''You can't rule out a rate hike in the fall.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Schaja said the weakness in yesterday's home-building report might have been exaggerated by poor weather. She also noted that the decline in starts -- to an annual rate of 1,512,000 units -- was confined to one region, the South.</p>
        <p>The bond market found little comfort in the reports, with traders and investors promptly pushing rates up a bit from Tuesday's levels.</p>
        <p>It was the energy component, which accounts for 7 percent of the Consumer Price Index, that accounted for most of the deceleration. After surging 5.6 percent in June, energy edged up 0.1 percent last month as a 2 percent rise for energy services was largely offset by a 1.6 percent decline for petroleum-based energy.</p>
        <p>Gasoline fell 2 percent after an 8.8 percent jump in June but is still 18.3 percent higher so far this year after soaring 30.1 percent in 1999. Airline fares, 0.7 percent higher last month, are up 9.7 percent so far this year.</p>
        <p>Food prices climbed 0.5 percent after rising just 0.1 percent in June, an acceleration that Patrick C. Jackman, a senior official at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said he could not explain in light of an excellent growing season. Perhaps, he speculated, there was some delayed impact from higher costs of transporting food.</p>
        <p>Medical care rose 0.3 percent last month and 4.1 percent for the latest 12 months. A subindex dominated by prescription drugs, the cost of which is likely to become an increasingly contentious subject of political debate, has risen 4.2 percent in the last 12 months. This compares with a 6.1 percent increase in the 1999 calendar year.</p>
        <p>But hospital costs have accelerated this year, to a 7.2 percent annual pace in the six months through July, compared with 5.3 percent for the six months ended in January.</p>
        <p>The so-called core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, has now risen at a 2.6 percent rate so far this year compared with 1.9 percent in 1999.</p>
        <p>''We've picked up a bit but it's not accelerating,'' said Robert G. Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. But while the current pace ''seems to be within the range of Federal Reserve acceptability,'' Mr. Dederick said, it remains an open question whether the economy will slow enough in coming months to keep inflation in check without further rate increases later this year or early in 2001.</p>
        <p>The consumer price report also showed that inflation in the New York metropolitan area ran at a 3.1 percent rate over the last 12 months compared with 3.5 percent for the average of American cities. Dallas-Fort Worth, with 5 percent, was the highest of the seven areas identified by name, with Chicago lowest, at 3 percent.</p>
        <p>The purchasing power of the 1982-84 consumer dollar now stands at 57.9 cents, with the 1967 dollar at 19.3 cents.</p>
