        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright pledged today that she will work to declassify United States government documents that may shed light on the kidnappings of hundreds of children from dissidents captured by the Argentine military during the dictatorship that governed here from 1976 to 1983.</p>
        <p>''This is a matter of conscience,'' she said at a news conference.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright, who is on a five-day tour of five South American nations, invited representatives of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo and Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo for a meeting today at the ambassador's residence.</p>
        <p>The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a rights group trying to locate children believed stolen from their imprisoned mothers, have requested that the Clinton administration open C.I.A. files that could help them in their search. At the meeting, the  groups also urged Dr. Albright to release documents related to Operation Condor, a plan conceived by several South American military dictatorships to arrest dissidents in one another's countries.</p>
        <p>''I said I would do my best to see what kind of papers there were,'' she told reporters. But in a reference to the Central Intelligence Agency, she added, ''As you know the State Department is not the keeper of all the papers.''</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini said he welcomed the promise, adding, ''The government of Argentina thinks any acts to clarify the past will be helpful.''</p>
        <p>But human rights activists expressed skepticism.</p>
        <p>''We do not believe her,'' said Hebe de Bonafini, president of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, adding that it was ''hypocritical of Albright to say she is going to look into something that the government she represents was largely responsible for.''</p>
        <p>Representatives of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo told Dr. Albright that they held the United States responsible for instructing Argentine officers at the School of the Americas, a military academy at the time located in Panama.</p>
        <p>Historians of the period say that Washington's ties to the Argentine military junta were not as close as they were to Gen. Augusto Pinochet's men in Chile.</p>
        <p>Relations between the United States and Argentina were tense during the Carter administration, especially after the junta sold wheat to the Soviet Union in defiance of the embargo that Washington instituted after Moscow invaded Afghanistan. And during the Falklands War, the Reagan administration supported Britain.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the C.I.A. is believed to have had a robust intelligence operation in Argentina at the time.</p>
        <p>Between 15,000 and 30,000 people disappeared or were executed during the ''dirty war'' between the military and two guerrilla groups, the largest of which carried the banner of Peronist populism. Many of those killed were students, labor activists and dissidents.</p>
        <p>An administration official said that there were far fewer documents in government files that shed light on Argentina than exist on Chile.</p>
        <p>In the case of Chile, the C.I.A. has continued to resist the release of many documents.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright's trip to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador is mainly intended to show support for democracy at a time when authoritarian habits are returning to several South American countries.</p>
