        <p>Now comes the moment when Vice President Al Gore gives his big speech, and most knowledgeable Democrats have the good sense to be scared to death. Mr. Gore's best attributes do not shine past the teleprompter, and over the years, the microphone has not been his friend.</p>
        <p>Normally, advice on how to make a smashing acceptance speech does not come cheap. Who knows what it cost to wipe that smirk off Gov. George W.

        <p>Now comes the moment when Vice President Al Gore gives his big speech, and most knowledgeable Democrats have the good sense to be scared to death. Mr. Gore's best attributes do not shine past the teleprompter, and over the years, the microphone has not been his friend.</p>
        <p>Normally, advice on how to make a smashing acceptance speech does not come cheap. Who knows what it cost to wipe that smirk off Gov. George W. Bush's face in time for his big moment in Philadelphia? But we found a number of expert speechwriters, image makers and commentators willing and even eager to provide Mr. Gore with a few suggestions gratis. Perhaps they are like surgeons happy to be called in on a difficult case. It's also possible that the Republicans want to see Mr. Gore fail and the Democrats want to be able to say ''I told you so'' if he does. At any rate, here is a sampler of their advice:</p>
        <p>Stuart Spencer, who was President Ronald Reagan's campaign strategist, believes Mr. Gore's team ''ought to calm him down a little.'' He explains: ''The first thing is not to run out to the podium like a kid at a high school basketball game. Don't high-five everybody. I laugh every time I see it. He skips, hops and jumps through the crowd. It's outrageously unpresidential.''</p>
        <p>Theodore Sorensen, who was President John F. Kennedy's primary speechwriter, offers a more succinct recipe. ''He must sound not like he's programmed, not like he's a politician, and not like he's a professor but like a president,'' Mr. Sorensen advised.</p>
        <p>Gerald Rafshoon, who was President Jimmy Carter's image maker, believes in sobriety and separation.  ''He needs to give a very substantive speech, and he needs to just talk about what he's going to do as president and not even mention the last eight years,'' Mr. Rafshoon offered. ''Clinton didn't do him a bit of good the other night. All he did was, he made a good case for Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rafshoon and Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist, agree that it is time to ignore the advisers. ''At this point, you just do what's in your gut,'' Mr. Carrick said. ''It's a great moment. There are 40,000 people prepared to love him. All the armchair quarterbacks, forget them all.''</p>
        <p>There are widely varying views on the notorious stiffness problem. Our Times colleague William Safire, who once wrote speeches for the notably unlimber Richard Nixon, suggests Mr. Gore could surprise people with a lighter touch. He recalled that the vice president demonstrated at this year's Gridiron dinner in Washington that he does a good job with self-deprecating humor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spencer, however, views humor as hazardous. ''You should never try jokes if you aren't very good at it,'' he warns.</p>
        <p>And finally Bill Maher, the host of ''Politically Incorrect,'' made this last-minute plea: ''Al Gore should examine the backgrounds of the delegates at the Democratic convention, and after realizing that they all have at least fourth-grade educations, not talk to them as if they don't.''</p>
