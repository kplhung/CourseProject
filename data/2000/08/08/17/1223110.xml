        <p>Phil Alongi was eager to share a view of the Democratic convention from his favorite perspective. ''Over here,'' he said excitedly, motioning to a temporarily uncrowded corner on the convention floor near the Tennessee delegation. ''I want you to get the whole effect.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alongi, senior producer of special events for NBC News, directed his gaze out across the floor and up at the object of his aesthetic affection: the NBC sky booth. Indeed, the two-tiered structure, painted ''NBC red'' -- a custom blend of 87 percent red, 12 percent yellow and 1 percent blue -- and outfitted with decorative flaps and balcony, was a thing of grand theatrical charms. The Graceland, if you will, of convention anchor booths.</p>
        <p>''It's supposed to make you feel: 'Here we are, America. We're bringing this into your homes. We've swung open and we're here,' '' Mr. Alongi said. ''The flaps, they're to create a feeling of openness, so that the front of the booth flares out.''</p>
        <p>And what of that attached balcony, with the railing that could have been pried off a beach house in Malibu? ''Remember,'' Mr. Alongi advised. ''It's L.A.''</p>
        <p>If the role of the contemporary political convention has undergone a radical transformation, from procedural forum to multimedia spectacle, so has the role of the modern network skybox. Once little more than a spartan cave from which the likes of Chet Huntley or Walter Cronkite could look out over the convention floor and point out the party chairmen from Cook County and Brooklyn, the booth has become a statement unto itself.</p>
        <p>Even the most cursory look up from the floor of the Staples Center, where the Democrats conclude their proceedings tomorrow night, provides a sense of how many different statements a sky booth can make.</p>
        <p>Clustered together at one end of the arena, the network booths make for an eclectic, disposable village, one that is built at great expense, inhabited for a week, and torn down.</p>
        <p>''It's the only time I've designed and built something that nine days later is gone,'' said David Rasche, the Chicago architect who designed the booth to house the arena studios for NBC and its sister operations, MSNBC and MSNBC.com. ''It's there and it's gone.''</p>
        <p>The broadcast networks may be scaling back their coverage, conceding to cable the task of gavel-to-gavel attention, but the conventions remain such crucial showcases for exhibiting reportorial and technological know-how that the competition over booth design has actually grown more intense.</p>
        <p>NBC, in fact, points out that it won an American Institute of Architects award for its booth at the 1996 Democratic convention in Chicago, designed by Mr. Rasche's firm, Valerio Dewalt Train Associates.</p>
        <p>The $500,000 booth apparently caused a stir; The Chicago Tribune's architecture critic observed at the time that ''the booth's size, color and sculptural form make it look as if it's about to take off from its lower-skybox-level mooring'' and added that it ''set off a serious case of booth envy among the other networks.''</p>
        <p>The networks declined to say how much they spent on the booths this year, but one news executive said the overall cost to a network of covering a convention runs as high as $5 million.</p>
        <p>''I think our anchor booth is very futuristic, and I guarantee you when you look up there, the brightest sign is 'ABC News,' '' said Roger Goodman, vice president of special projects for, yes, ABC News. The ABC sign is, in fact, a departure from convention wisdom: unlike the ''light boxes'' that other networks use to flash their logos, ABC has affixed an electronic ''video wall'' to the booth and installed behind it a smaller one beaming the company's signature revolving globe.</p>
        <p>The ABC design is a concession to fiscal reality. (Unlike other networks, ABC's control room is not on-site but remains in New York City.) And just as unusual, ABC uses the booth more as window dressing than as the centerpiece of its programming. Peter Jennings is doing the news from the convention floor and from a suite just off the floor, and the convention background is added by computer.</p>
        <p>''We wanted Peter to have access to the floor for more accurate and better-quality reporting,'' said Marc Burstein, executive producer of special events for ABC News.</p>
        <p>The network booths do indeed seem to shout ''Look at me!'' whether the sentiment is reflected in the neutral-toned, scallop-windowed sleekness of the CNN sky booth, or the modular spareness of the double-decker CBS shelter, painted a traditional CBS lapis blue. (Only the PBS skybox has more modest ambitions, advertising itself with a simple sign that seems to whisper, ''NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.'')</p>
        <p>''We wanted a clean, high-tech contemporary look,'' said Gary L. Bastien, the Irvine, Calif., architect who designed the CBS booth. ''The approach was that CBS is such a cutting-edge media-type company, and that's what we wanted to symbolize.'' (If you call ''Survivor'' cutting edge, and they probably do.) To make the facade as dynamic as possible, Mr. Bastien said, ''we used angular forms and up-lighting.''</p>
        <p>What the scenic and production designers have to do is rapidly turn basic sports-arena skyboxes into customized television studios.</p>
        <p>NBC, for instance, will convert the booths back into skyboxes in nine days. Some networks combine two and even three adjacent boxes to accommodate their sets and anchor desks; others make use of skyboxes on top of each other for a vertical effect.</p>
        <p>The quarters are tight: from floor to ceiling measures only seven and a half feet, and the network specifications for camera-readiness are precise down to the glare-free angle of the booth windows overlooking the convention floor.</p>
        <p>''We had to be concerned with how you put in a piece of glass without a seam in it that is 24 feet long and 7 feet high and is angled precisely at 14 degrees, so you don't have a reflection,'' Mr. Bastien said. ''It can't be 13 degrees and it can't be 15. It's something over the years that they know that works.''</p>
        <p>The designs so mimic the demands and constraints of outdoor architecture that the networks even seek variances from the convention planners to add to the dimensions of the boxes, as if they were summer bungalows getting new decks. Both NBC and CNN, for instance, extended the booths three feet into the hall to give the anchors more elbow room.</p>
        <p>''This is really a case of form following function,'' said Craig McMahon, CNN's director of production design.</p>
        <p>That does not mean, however, that there is no room for imagination. The bay windows in CNN's gleaming horizontal booth, designed by Rene Lagler, a veteran set designer for television who created the podium for the Democratic convention, are intended as a visual echo of the rounded style of the twin anchor desks occupied by Larry King, and Bernard Shaw and Judy Woodruff.</p>
        <p>There is, of course, only so far a designer can really experiment at an event so richly evocative of all things traditionally American. Stars and stripes tend to get a heavy workout in the patterns chosen for the sets and backdrops in the booths.</p>
        <p>Victor Paganuzzi, the production designer for CBS and a veteran of 13 conventions, said the color scheme is pretty much a foregone conclusion.</p>
        <p>''I've always felt,'' he said, ''that red, white and blue is perfect for the occasion.''</p>
