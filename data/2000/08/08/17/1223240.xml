        <p>At first glance, things might seem not to have gone particularly well for the organizers of Al Gore's Democratic convention these past few days.</p>
        <p>President Clinton's speech began almost 30 minutes late on Monday. On Tuesday night, the evening was weighted down with a procession of speakers from the party's past, so that by the time the keynote speaker began delivering his address, prime time was fading, delegates were sneaking out the door and the networks were losing interest quickly.</p>
        <p>And the Democrats managed with barely 10 minutes to spare to keep tonight's roll call from spilling over into tomorrow.</p>
        <p>All of this looks fairly bad by conventional measures of modern-day conventions, which are heavily focused on live network news coverage. But none of it may matter.</p>
        <p>There were a few grumblings -- outside the Gore campaign -- among senior Democrats tonight about the evident absence of discipline.</p>
        <p>But in part because of planning -- and in part, one top Democratic official acknowledged tonight, because of sheer luck -- the management of the spectacle and the media in the Democratic convention seems to be playing, if in slightly messy ways, to the advantage of Mr. Gore, if not necessarily to the Democratic Party at large.</p>
        <p>Yes, the keynote speaker did not take the stage until nearly 11 p.m.,  Eastern time, on Tuesday. But for days, aides to Mr. Gore have said that the last thing they wanted voters to pay attention to that night was what was taking place on the stage here.</p>
        <p>The voters' attention was supposed to have been focused on Mr. Gore meeting President Clinton in Michigan -- and Mr. Clinton leaving the stage.</p>
        <p>The convention, meanwhile, was used as a place to deal with the party's obligations, generally to the left-wing of the party, whose leaders were given speaking slots that night.</p>
        <p>If that drew little attention from the general public, Mr. Gore's centrist Democratic aides said, all the better.</p>
        <p>''It's check the box day,'' one of Mr. Gore's aides said.</p>
        <p>And yes, Mr. Clinton talked so late that he bumped David Letterman back minutes, and wiped out the lucrative East Coast news stations.</p>
        <p>But even as Mr. Clinton's aides were described as frantic over the clock as they waited for Mr. Clinton to go on to the podium, Mr. Gore's aides were sanguine, confident that viewers would hang in for Mr. Clinton's last pitch.</p>
        <p>And the ratings proved them right.</p>
        <p>This seeming display of disorganization by the Democratic Party pushed Hillary Rodham Clinton's speech 20 minutes late and right into the living rooms of millions of American television viewers, many of whom would not have seen the speech by the first lady (and Senate candidate in New York) had it gone on time. Democratic officials insisted this was pure coincidence. Network officials, forced to pick up the speech, were at best dubious. Mrs. Clinton's aides were serenely silent.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party has never been known as a model of efficiency, and Democrats have long joked that they would have trouble arranging a two-car funeral.</p>
        <p>The contrasting display of Swiss precision offered by the Republicans at their convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago seemed designed, in part, to highlight the sloppier ways of the Democratic Party, and the Democrats have obliged.</p>
        <p>Not surprising, some Democrats have sought to make inefficiency seem a virtue. ''Look, we are more free-wheeling,'' said Edward G. Rendell, the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ''Look at all the speakers that we have. I think we have 240 speakers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rendell acknowledged that having Mr. Clinton speak after 11 p.m., Eastern time, was less than ideal. ''But I wouldn't make too much of it,'' he said. ''And they've done much better since the first night. And the first night they were relaxed because they had a fail-safe because they knew the networks would not pull the president.''</p>
        <p>And the fact is that while inefficiency might have served the Democrats well these first two nights -- or at least not hurt the party -- things began to change this evening with the first part of what Mr. Gore's aides view as the only truly meaningful nights of this week.</p>
        <p>The first was tonight, when Mr. Gore was nominated by his daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, and introduced by a biographical film, directed by Spike Jonze, all designed to splash some color to Mr. Gore's gray outlines. Mr. Lieberman made it on stage tonight right in the middle of prime time, walking out at 10:07 p.m., and Mr. Gore's unannounced appearance after his daughter nominated him took place at 11 p.m. sharp. The second night that matters is Thursday, when Mr. Gore delivers his acceptance speech. One of Mr. Gore's aides said flatly tonight that that would happen by 10:15 sharp. (A few minutes later, this adviser amended his advisory: ''Or maybe a few minutes after that.''</p>
        <p>In some measure, the lax organization serves neither Mr. Gore nor his party. One of Mr. Gore's senior aides tonight said that Mr. Clinton would draw an audience no matter how late he spoke, within reason. Another Democrat outside the campaign described it as a ''critical mistake,'' adding, ''It is unconscionable that one of the greatest political speeches you and I have ever heard went on until 11:40.''</p>
        <p>The situation was no different on Tuesday, when the proceedings loped on till midnight. The only event that Mr. Gore's aides really cared about was the speech by Caroline Kennedy,  an event so unusual that they assumed that viewers would tune in or, if not, it would receive abundant coverage on the late news.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers -- some of whom admitted they hadn't even bothered watching the convention -- said they were less than distressed that speakers like Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Jesse L. Jackson and Bill Bradley might not have escaped the notice of most American viewers.</p>
        <p>NBC News did not even broadcast that night, a decision that Mr. Gore's advisers did not quarrel with. The prime time network television audience for the convention, though strong on Monday night, when President Clinton spoke, had died down considerably by Tuesday, according to Nielsen Media Research.</p>
