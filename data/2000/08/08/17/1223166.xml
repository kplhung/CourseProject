        <p>For anyone not named Tiger Woods, it has become even more difficult to win major championships.</p>
        <p>The domination of Woods and the challenge facing his competitors have become the main themes heading into the P.G.A. Championship, which begins Thursday at Valhalla Golf Club.

        <p>For anyone not named Tiger Woods, it has become even more difficult to win major championships.</p>
        <p>The domination of Woods and the challenge facing his competitors have become the main themes heading into the P.G.A. Championship, which begins Thursday at Valhalla Golf Club. By winning three of the last four majors, the last two in runaway fashion, Woods has made a clear statement that he is the world's best player, by a wide margin.</p>
        <p>If Woods wins this weekend, he will become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three consecutive majors, another milestone for the player who has put an indelible stamp on golf at age 24.</p>
        <p>But while Woods is chasing history, where does that leave everyone else? There is a new sense of urgency among the world's other top players, who realize that with Woods taking most of golf's biggest prizes recently, there isn't much left.</p>
        <p>''Basically, Tiger is going to be the player to beat for the foreseeable future,'' said Darren Clarke of Ireland, who defeated Woods earlier this year at the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship. ''He's probably going to win two out of the four majors every year. That is going to leave two for other players to win. The fact that Tiger is going to play so well gives less opportunity for the rest of us to win. Any time you have a chance to win a major, it has more importance now than it did before.''</p>
        <p>So with world-class players like Colin Montgomerie, Phil Mickelson and Lee Westwood still looking for their first major championship, the year's final major will have an intense feel to it. All eyes will be on the 9:13 a.m. threesome featuring Woods, Vijay Singh and Jack Nicklaus, whose mother, Helen, died today at age 90 in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Despite his mother's death, Nicklaus announced today that he would play in the tournament to honor her wishes. But at age 60, Nicklaus could be playing his final P.G.A. Championship, and his peers and the gallery realize the magnitude of that fact.</p>
        <p>''When you think of major championships, you think of Jack Nicklaus,'' Tom Lehman said. ''As long as I have been playing golf, he has always been teeing it up in the majors. It will be very strange not to see Jack's name on the roster in a major championship.''</p>
        <p>But while Nicklaus won 18 majors, including five P.G.A. Championships, most players would settle for just one. Some great players have never won the P.G.A. Championship, including Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson. And the P.G.A. has been the most difficult major to defend. Nobody has won back-to-back P.G.A. Championships since Denny Shute in 1936 and 1937, so Woods figures to sweat this week.</p>
        <p>Actually, everyone will have to sweat. With midday temperatures about 90 degrees this week, along with high humidity, anyone who is not in shape will suffer. Woods's shirt has been drenched during practice rounds, and players will have to drink plenty of fluids.</p>
        <p>''I have never sweated as much in my whole life,'' said Sergio Garcia, who lost to Woods by one stroke in an exciting back-nine duel at last year's P.G.A.</p>
        <p>But the heat may be more intense on several players who believe they are overdue to win a major. Among this group is Montgomerie, who has won the European Order of Merit seven consecutive times, but has never won a tournament in the United States.</p>
        <p>Montgomerie looked good today, having lost 20 pounds since the British Open. He hoped having less weight would improve his stamina, and his game.</p>
        <p>''I just woke up one morning and said, 'I don't want to be overweight anymore,' '' he said. ''I decided to go on a very strict diet and fitness regimen. It is going to be somebody very tough that is going to win this, mentally as well as physically.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the United States Open, where par was a good score for everyone except Woods, Valhalla should allow players on top of their games to shoot low scores. All four par 5's are reachable in two shots, and though the rough is thick, the fairways are generous.</p>
        <p>Many believe that Valhalla is the perfect place for a player to win his first major, but time will tell. Six of the last seven majors have been won by players who had already won one. Paul Lawrie, who won last year's British Open, was the only exception.</p>
        <p>But no matter how much people analyze this tournament, Woods will be the main focus, and how he plays on Thursday and Friday will go a long way toward setting the tone of the event. The last two majors haven't been close, and Woods shows no pity, particularly in majors. Will anyone beat him at Valhalla? We are about to find out.</p>
        <p>''Tiger has taken it to a different level,'' Montgomerie said. ''Everybody has to get to the next level if they want to compete. When Michael Jordan started playing basketball, people had to improve to compete. When Carl Lewis started running, people had to improve. When Pele played football, people had to improve. Muhammad Ali was the same. He raised the standards.</p>
        <p>''Tiger is the best player in the world by a long, long way, and we have to raise our standards to join his. We're all trying. We are all failing, but we are all trying.''</p>
