        <p>Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice president, retired from the Halliburton Company with millions of dollars worth of stock options that he cannot cash until long after the new administration takes office, the company announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney has previously said that he would sell his stake in Halliburton, an energy services company, before he takes office, assuming the Republicans win the presidency.</p>
        <p>But under Halliburton's stock option plan, Mr. Cheney would not be allowed to sell the options, which cannot be transferred except on death.</p>
        <p>As a result, he would have to either abandon the holding or keep it until nearly two years after a new administration takes office, which would give him a large stake in Halliburton while he could also be serving as vice president.</p>
        <p>Dirk Vande Beek, a spokesman for Mr. Cheney, declined to say whether Mr. Cheney would retain the options if he was elected. He quoted Mr. Cheney as saying: ''I will do whatever the law requires. I will do whatever I need to do to avoid any conflict of interest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vande Beek said he did not know what the law would require Mr. Cheney to do, but Chuck Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity in Washington said in an interview before the details of the stock plan were disclosed that ''there is no legal requirement'' that a vice president dispose of such assets.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lewis said there would be a ''built-in conflict of interest'' for Mr. Cheney to hold such options during the campaign or after he was elected.</p>
        <p>Halliburton's stock fluctuates in large part because of changes in oil prices. As a result, if Mr. Chency kept the options, he would stand to profit if oil prices rose, a factor that the administration's energy policies could affect.</p>
        <p>The chief financial officer of Halliburton, Gary Morris, said in a telephone interview yesterday that under the Halliburton stock option plan,  there was no way for Mr. Cheney to transfer the options, such as giving them to a charity, before they were exercised.</p>
        <p>Halliburton said it would report an $8.5 million one-time expense as a result of Mr. Cheney's departure. Mr. Morris said the expense covered the value of the options and the restricted stock that had not yet vested before Mr. Cheney retired, as well as an estimated bonus for 2000 that Mr. Cheney will receive if the company meets certain financial goals.</p>
        <p>''It will be roughly in the neighborhood of $1 million,'' Mr. Morris said of the bonus. ''It is not a big number.''</p>
        <p>Halliburton declined to give the value of Mr. Cheney's pension, which is based on contributions made by the company during the five years he worked for the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney owns restricted stock and options to purchase stock that have a current value, based on yesterday's closing stock price of just over $54, of $39.6 million. In May he cashed in options on 100,000 shares of stock for a profit of $3 million. All that value came from grants by the company during his tenure; he has never invested any money in the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's contract with Halliburton gave him the right to retire after he reached age 62, but the board chose to waive that provision for Mr. Cheney, 59, the former secretary of defense. Had the board not done so, he would have forfeited options to buy 400,000 shares as well as 140,000 shares of restricted stock. Mr. Morris said the company calculated the value of the shares based on the assumption that they were all sold at a price of $42.25, the closing value on July 25, the day after Mr. Cheney was chosen as Gov. George W. Bush's running mate.</p>
        <p>But the stock has risen dramatically since then, and those securities would now be worth $13.6 million, up from $7.7 million on July 25. Moreover, because the options expire at various dates from 2005 through 2009, their value would be much higher if they could be sold, since a buyer would take into account the possibility of future increases in the price of Halliburton stock.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, The New York Times reported that Halliburton's board of directors had been told the value of Mr. Cheney's package was $20 million. Mr. Morris said he was not familiar with that number, and said he did not know how much the options package would be worth if valued according to conventional options valuation models.</p>
        <p>In previous Halliburton filings, the company has used assumptions that would have valued the options as being worth more than $20 million, but it was not clear what assumptions were used in estimating the value of the package for board members.</p>
        <p>While the company did not give Mr. Cheney the right to exercise options before he otherwise would have been able to do so, it did remove the restrictions on 140,000 shares. As a result, he will be able to sell those shares whenever he wishes.</p>
        <p>Some of the 400,000 options that have not yet vested for Mr. Cheney will vest in December, and thus could be exercised before the new administration takes office on Jan. 20.</p>
        <p>But other options will vest in December 2001 and others in December 2002. The value of those options, if they could be exercised today, would be $3.8 million. That value could rise substantially, of course, since those options do not have to be exercised until 2008 and 2009.</p>
        <p>There do not appear to be any directly comparable situations in recent history. Robert E. Rubin, the former secretary of treasury for President Clinton, has a large investment in Goldman Sachs, the investment banking firm he had served as a chief executive.</p>
        <p>But that company was not public at the time and Mr. Rubin's interest was that of a limited partner who did not share in the profits but was paid interest for the use of his money.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, he purchased an insurance policy that would have protected him had the value of his Goldman stake declined. While several officials have set up blind trusts, such a trust would not appear to be useful in this case since Mr. Cheney would know that the options could not donehave been exercised and sold until late 2002, regardless of whether or not the trustee kept him informed about other investments.</p>
