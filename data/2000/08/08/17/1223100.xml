        <p>Thomas Beller, a writer in New York, is putting literature on the map. Mr. Beller's Neighborhood, a new Web site (www  .mrbellersneighborhood.com), divides an aerial view of Manhattan into nine areas, then links essays, poems and stories to the locations where they are set If the viewer zooms in on the Upper East Side, for example, a red dot at 77th Street and Madison Avenue leads to W. H. Auden's poem ''In Schrafft's.'' Mr. Beller, author of the novel ''The Sleep-Over Artist,'' said the project, which was produced with the online magazine Word.com, was ''a narrative that sprawls in many directions.'' In other words, it's all over the map.</p>
