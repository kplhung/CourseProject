        <p>SINCE Tibor Kalman was a friend of mine, I'm not able to write an objective review of ''Tiborocity: Design and Un design by Tibor Kalman,'' the New Museum of Contemporary Art's lively retrospective of the late graphic designer's work. But I'd feel idiotic if I didn't write a personal story before the show comes down, this weekend.</p>
        <p>''Tiborocity'' had me shadowboxing with my friend, who died last year, over some of the issues we used to argue about. What is sensibility? What is visual culture? How do you maintain, or even measure integrity in the consumer society? Those are a few of the issues we didn't exhaust in Tibor's lifetime. Continuing the conversation is my way of remembering him.</p>
        <p>Tibor was an artist of the distribution system -- the economic framework that bridges the gap between production and consumption. His metier encompassed art direction, graphic and product design, corporate branding and exhibition display. M&amp;Co, his New York studio, achieved high visibility with designs for Artforum and Interview magazines; CD covers for Talking Heads and Laurie Anderson; brochures for Red Square, an East Village apartment building; and perhaps most memorably, a line of Surrealistic watches and clocks. The tone throughout was satirical, a lightly mocking wit deployed against design, against the consumer, against the trendiness embodied by M&amp;Co and its clients.</p>
        <p>Since we live in an era dominated by distribution, Tibor's work was intrinsically provocative, for how can art exist within it? Art, even Andy Warhol's, deals with truth, with the difference between life as it is and as we would like it to be. Distribution techniques -- advertising, graphic design, commercial photography, public relations, store display -- traffic in distortion and the exploitation of hope.  That pill is not going to help you lose weight. You know this perfectly well.  So does the manufacturer. The principal function of the distribution system is to loosen our mutual grip on reality.</p>
        <p>Tibor and I both started out as window dressers. His windows (for the company that evolved into Barnes &amp; Noble) featured books. Mine (for a shop called Design Research) showcased classic modern design. Our later paths led us toward the reverse of our respective displays. But the opposites remained conjoined. I write about the world of visual appearances. Tibor's designs often featured words.</p>
        <p>A conflict between word and image initially brought us together. In 1985, Tibor was hired as the art director for Artforum magazine. I wrote the magazine's architecture column. The magazine already had a reputation for creating great layouts at the expense of writing. Tibor pushed this to an extreme. For his first issue, he had the notion of isolating random letters throughout the text and printing them in light blue instead of black. In my column, the letter ''e'' was chosen for this transformation. Since it made the text nearly unreadable, I naturally saw his fiddling as a sign of disrespect.</p>
        <p>In hindsight, I can see that he was giving tit for tat. Oscar Wilde said,  ''The primary aim of the critic is to see the object as in itself it really is not.'' Why shouldn't design return the favor? Why not art-direct a poor critic's column out of recognition?</p>
        <p>Like others who started out in the late 1960's, Tibor had a complicated relationship to authority. The counterculture, which many baby boomers saw as a bright beginning, came to a messy end. The last gasp of 19th-century Romanticism, it marked the dissipation of Romantic attitudes from a cultural elite to every adolescent's natural rite of passage. Rebellion became generic.</p>
        <p>For some, the new media and information industries represented the rebirth of countercultural thinking in mainstream form. You really do have to Think Different to navigate the Web. You can create an entire worldview from a laptop. Point of view, sensibility, radiance can be transmitted worldwide. Tibor mainly worked in traditional media. As he was essentially a graphic designer, most of his output consisted of magazines, record and CD covers and print and TV ads, with the occasional foray into product design and even urban design. Still, he was a McLuhan child, a global villager who regarded media as a consciousness-raising device and advocated liberation from the linear authority of print culture.</p>
        <p>The show suggests that Tibor's medium was as much tactile as visual. He traded in textures of thought: shapes, colors, stylistic periods, atmospheres rubbing one another like subway riders. Think of his umbrella lined with a blue sky, a Magritte pret-a-porter, the Surrealist icon made democratic and practical.</p>
        <p>The closest I ever came to having a maiden auntie to send me a Christmas fruitcake each year was the holiday gift that arrived annually from Tibor's company. These tended to have socially uplifting themes. One year it would be a medicine cabinet in the shape of a red cross. Another year it would be a secondhand book stuffed with paper money. Included were envelopes, pre addressed to charities. (I spent the dough on myself.)</p>
        <p>I took professional interest in Tibor's work for the 42nd Street Redevelopment Authority. Along with Robert A. M. Stern, Tibor was instrumental in creating the so-called interim plan, a set of guidelines governing the look of storefronts, signage and other elements in the rebuilding of Times Square. Besides contributing ideas, Tibor designed an immense sidewalk installation for the south side of 42nd Street on the short block between Broadway and Seventh Avenue.</p>
        <p>Titled ''Everybody,'' the project, designed with Scott Stowell, crystallized Tibor's aspirations for the revamped Crossroads of the World: socially inclusive, focused on the street, Surrealist in spirit. The major element was a large billboard, mounted just above sidewalk level. The word ''Everybody'' was spelled out in black letters against a background of school-bus yellow. Attached to the billboard was a small assortment of funky chairs. These could be reached by climbing a set of ziggurat-shaped bleachers. When seated, you gazed out on the Midtown circus with your feet dangling in air.</p>
        <p>The project revolved, if just intuitively, around Surrealism's two intellectual poles: Freudian dream space (the slight elevation above street level evokes the loss of gravity, the low-altitude flight of dreaming hysterics), and Marxian social justice (the place serves the people, not the other way around). The school-bus yellow was itself a major component of the sign: Tibor's was largely an educational sensibility. He loved to absorb and to share.</p>
        <p>All these things come across very clearly throughout the New Museum exhibition. It displays the range of artifacts Tibor collected, and his designs expressed the fusion of his references. Generosity and humility, more than political consciousness, were the transforming agents in his creative process. Perhaps the capacity to learn in public is the active ingredient in the creative sensibility.</p>
        <p>The worst betrayal anyone can commit in my eyes is to move to Italy and leave me behind. So I was not disposed to forgive Tibor for accepting an offer to go to Rome as the editor of Colors, an advertorial magazine put out by Benetton, the clothing manufacturer. Nor was I inclined to like the magazine. I've never liked Benetton's clothes.</p>
        <p>But I could see how frustrating it was for Tibor to design a magazine without exercising creative control over it. And I could also see the appeal of this particular magazine. There aren't many publications out there that draw a firm line between advertising and editorial. So it was disarming to come upon a magazine that was entirely upfront about being an ad. Still, Colors was an ad. It skewed the contract between the editor and the audience.</p>
        <p>I confess that in my memory the magazine is largely a blur. Only a few images stand out from it, like those depicting Queen Elizabeth II as a dark-skinned, tropical monarch and Spike Lee as white-skinned suburban hip-hop devotee.</p>
        <p>Tibor's magazine led him deeper and deeper into his own contradictions. That is what was so great about it. Unfortunately, it didn't give him space or time to work them out. These conflicts stemmed from the same problem: visual culture is a contradiction in terms.</p>
        <p>Visual literacy once seemed like a liberating concept -- a release from the musty weight of history, books, linear thinking and the print tradition that McLuhan had consigned to history's dustbin. Images, and the prospect of communicating through images alone, offered the hope of changing consciousness. It was a logical repository for the counterculture's universalist ideals.</p>
        <p>By the mid-1980's, however, it had become clear that these ambitions could not be attained by instinct alone. A more analytic, historically informed approach was needed to prevent visual culture from degenerating into a cult of ignorance and commercial manipulation. One afternoon, when Tibor and I were wandering through the splendors of Baroque Rome, I wondered whether he and I were seeing the same thing. Here was the most extravagant display of visual culture staged by Western civilization. Did Tibor get the Baroque message? All was possible, all could be questioned, provided that you accepted the absolute authority of the church. Sculptures, fountains, urban vistas, murals, buildings -- the most sumptuous entertainments would be provided for those who surrendered their souls to the Father.</p>
        <p>In Tibor's magazine, every social injustice could be exposed, every authority mocked -- provided you flew the United Colors of Benetton. Every image was permissible, every pictorial juxtaposition would be laid out, provided you saluted the flag of visual culture. Which I did not. It had become the banner of the consumer society, a system as authoritarian as that of 17th-century Rome.</p>
        <p>A few days after seeing the show, I was talking with Tod Williams, 31,  director of the critically acclaimed movie ''The Adventures of Sebastian Cole.'' He told me, ''For my generation, images are garbage.''</p>
        <p>I had to laugh. What made the comment so devastating is that proponents of visual culture were always playing the generation card. They exploited adolescent illiteracy for self-serving ends. The notion of visual culture justified their own lack of cultivation (why read?) while giving them a sense of moral purpose (as teachers of visual literacy). In one breath, they announced: ''The future belongs to the imagists, and . . . let's do it for the kids.''</p>
        <p>These two dubious messages provided the slim intellectual content of Colors No. 13, the last issue Tibor edited before returning to New York. This provocative number contained pages of pictures and one page of text. These were agreeably laid out. A nice album of pix. A style book of personal adornment (tattoos, makeup, eyeglass frames); of erotic and violent encounters (mating carrots, a car crash). Rows of toes next to rows of noses. Blood. Variety meats. Surgery. At the end, a confused editorial argued that the editors didn't really think that pictures were more truthful, but somehow they were. Words to that effect. Then a suggestion that if you've wasted time reading the editorial you owe it to yourself to go back and stare at a picture for the same length of time, etc.</p>
        <p>After my conversation with Tod Williams, I thought, yes, issue No. 13 was basically a load of garbage. The editorial was trashy, too. It said: ''Look at my garbage. Don't like what you see? Look again. Harder.'' And it was generational garbage. A baby boomer was saying to his younger audience: ''Here, take our priceless garbage. We give it to you -- the leaders of the 21st century. Yours to cherish. Yours to adore.''</p>
        <p>Actually, I don't think that images are garbage. I doubt very much that a filmmaker like Tod Williams does, either. People like us must be scopophiliacs to do what we do. But visual culture per se is not a visual phenomenon. It has barely a glancing relationship to aesthetics in any form. Rather, it is a social, psychological, political and, above all, an economic manifestation. To be visually literate, in any but the most superficial consumerist fashion, you have to tear aside the screen of images and locate the nonvisual factors that are running the show.</p>
        <p>My hunch is that, if Tibor's life hadn't been cut short, he would have done just that. He would have had a commercially successful way to educate people about the many facets of visuality. We would all be hooked on Tibor.com, where we would find combined access to the most extraordinary array of images and the most dazzling written insights into the visual apparatus. We would have Avedon's ''Dovima With Elephants'' along with commentaries on it by Arthur Danto and Janet Malcolm. We could download entire libraries of the greats illustrated with before-and-after pictures of cosmetic makeovers. Tibor would return to showcasing books, in other words, much as the window of this page is dressed with his designs.</p>
