        <p>Most illegal guns reach the streets of New Jersey after being bought legally in Southern states with relaxed gun laws, then smuggled north by car, federal officials say. But up to 120 9-millimeter and .40-caliber handguns took a more direct route, shipped via United Parcel Service from a warehouse in Virginia to homes in Newark by the former manager of the warehouse, according to charges filed this week in Federal District Court here.</p>

        <p>Most illegal guns reach the streets of New Jersey after being bought legally in Southern states with relaxed gun laws, then smuggled north by car, federal officials say. But up to 120 9-millimeter and .40-caliber handguns took a more direct route, shipped via United Parcel Service from a warehouse in Virginia to homes in Newark by the former manager of the warehouse, according to charges filed this week in Federal District Court here.</p>
        <p>The manager, Mario Guzman Jr., 26, of Newark, was arrested on Tuesday on federal charges that he shipped the guns from a warehouse owned by the gun manufacturer, Heckler &amp; Koch, in Sterling, Va. He was ordered held in lieu of $100,000 bail today, after pleading not guilty before Judge Susan D. Davis in federal court.</p>
        <p>Judge Davis allowed Mr. Guzman's release on the condition that court officials certify that no guns, legal or otherwise, be kept at the Newark home of his mother, Luvinda Guzman. Mr. Guzman's lawyer said his client planned to stay with his mother after his release. Mr. Guzman has no prior arrest record, said his lawyer, John D. Caruso.</p>
        <p>The investigation began after Heckler &amp; Koch conducted a routine inventory of the warehouse last winter and found that one box of 40 weapons was missing. Officials said Mr. Guzman was asked to account for it, and told the company, falsely, that it had been found.</p>
        <p>But two months later, a 9-millimeter handgun bearing a serial number traced to the same box was seized by Newark police officer who had responded to a report of shots being fired. A more thorough inventory by the company found that the box was indeed missing. So far, nine of the weapons have been recovered.</p>
        <p>Officials said it was about that time that Mr. Guzman resigned from the company. A search of the warehouse, requested by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, found that two additional boxes of 40 weapons were missing.</p>
        <p>To put Mr. Guzman's suspected cache in perspective, 1,913 illegal guns were seized last year throughout New Jersey, and in Rockland, Orange and Sullivan Counties in New York, which are covered by the firearms agency's Fairfield, N.J., office, said Joe Green, a spokesman for the agency. So the warehouse manager's arrest is not likely to stem the flow of illegal guns, which usually come into the area by the more conventional smugglers' route, Mr. Green said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Guzman is charged with sending at least one shipment of the guns to his mother's home, on Orange Street, on March 29. He is also charged with sending another shipment two days earlier to a second Newark address, on Ridge Street. The authorities declined to name the recipient of that shipment, who the homeowner said did not live there.</p>
        <p>Officials said Mr. Guzman abruptly quit his job at the warehouse on April 3, then moved back to Newark, where he has been living with his aunt, Vivian Sosa, a Newark police officer. Ms. Sosa, 32, a seven-year veteran of the department, remained on duty pending an investigation by the Newark Police Department's internal affairs office, the department announced.</p>
        <p>The investigation into the gun shipments from the Heckler warehouse is continuing, said Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office in Newark, which brought the charges. He declined to say whether Mr. Guzman's mother or his aunt were suspects.</p>
