        <p>Karenna Gore Schiff, the candidate's daughter, tonight filled the role once played by governors, senators, former presidents and former first ladies by seconding her father's nomination to be president, praising him in remarks for balancing family and government work, and helping her with a dinosaur diorama after a long day of Congressional hearings.</p>
        <p>In their unending quest to make national conventions into sunny talk shows they hope the networks will broadcast, the parties have banned internal party argument over policy, serialized roll calls over three nights and miniaturized important speeches (except by President Clinton).</p>
        <p>The keynote speech, a first-night event intended to set a convention tone (and to propel a speaker like Harold Stassen or Earl Warren or Mario Cuomo into national prominence) vanished entirely from the Republican calendar. Here among the Democrats, it might as well have. Representative Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee, a 30-year-old second termer, delivered it on the second night, after the networks had quit.</p>
        <p>Nominating speeches were first used to persuade delegates to vote for a candidate. Once nominees began to be settled before conventions began, their purpose became persuading a party and a nation of the breadth of his support.</p>
        <p>Today, if any purpose remains, it is to humanize and depoliticize. Two weeks ago in Philadelphia, the Texas Republican with the second most at stake in the election, Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, nominated his boss in less than a minute, ''Mr. Chairman and fellow delegates, I am proud to nominate the current governor of the great state of Texas and the next president of the United States -- George W. Bush.''</p>
        <p>It was a formality, preceding the formality of the state-by-state roll call that the party's rules have not got around to eliminating.</p>
        <p>Tonight's presentations, a nomination by Tommy Lee Jones, Mr. Gore's Harvard roommate, and seconding speeches by Mrs. Schiff and Lois M. DeBerry, a Tennessee legislator, were personal reflections. Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic Party, said they could answer an important question about Mr. Gore: ''What kind of decisions did you make before you were in government?''</p>
        <p>Other speakers, he said, dealt with issues and Mr. Gore's record in government. Indeed they have, sometimes with a level of exaggeration that Mr. Gore himself would envy. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, for example, credited Mr. Gore with helping pass the children's health insurance legislation, when, in fact, Mr. Gore followed White House orders in May 1997, and disappeared, after promising Mr. Kennedy he would come to the Senate to break a tie.</p>
        <p>Tonight's speakers were chosen, Mr. Andrew said, to help America ''know Al Gore more as a person.'' The same assignment will fall Thursday to the candidate's wife, Tipper.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones may have a political following, but only in Hollywood, and Mrs. Schiff and Mrs. Gore have none at all. But the Democrats, like the Republicans, are counting on their conventions as television shows, not as tools for party unity.</p>
        <p>And if there is one thing they fear more than a long speech, it is the disease of dissent. Mr. Bush's campaign officials not only thwarted debate about abortion, but they also deemed it destructive to let delegates debate whether to make Republican National Committee members automatic delegates.</p>
        <p>And Democrats, congenitally incapable of marching in perfect lock step, confined their uncertainty about whether the party was liberal enough to grumbling to reporters.</p>
        <p>It is true, of course, that disagreement and uncertain outcomes would make news. But that raises the fear that a party that fights over something would look bad to the public.</p>
        <p>One veteran Republican, Bill Brock, the former national chairman, disagrees. ''A convention without contest,'' he said ''is a convention without a lot of heart....''</p>
        <p>Or, as Martin J. Plissner, the retired executive political director of CBS News, put it, keynotes, nominating speeches and platform fights ''go back to the era when conventions had decisions to make.''</p>
