        <p>The wireless arm of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan, the world's biggest communications company, is in preliminary negotiations to acquire a minority stake in the pending wireless joint venture between the BellSouth Corporation and SBC Communications Inc., two of the local Bell telephone giants, people close to the talks said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Details of the discussions were unclear yesterday, but one person close to the talks said the Japanese wireless unit, known as NTT DoCoMo, was negotiating to buy no more than 20 percent of the SBC-BellSouth venture.</p>
        <p>The venture could be worth more than $60 billion and would be the second-biggest wireless operation in the United States after the wireless joint venture between Verizon Communications, which was formed by the merger of Bell Atlantic and the GTE Corporation, and Vodafone AirTouch of Britain.</p>
        <p>The BellSouth-SBC venture would serve more than 16 million customers and would offer wireless service to areas with more than half of the nation's population.</p>
        <p>One person close to the talks added, however, that the discussions were only in their earliest stages and could fall apart.</p>
        <p>''This is not even baby talk,'' the person said. ''This is babies looking at each other across the room.''</p>
        <p>The talks were reported yesterday by the Web site of The Financial Times.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for BellSouth and SBC declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Earlier this summer, NTT DoCoMo lost a battle to acquire another United States wireless operation, the VoiceStream Wireless Corporation. VoiceStream ended up agreeing to be acquired for $50 billion by another overseas communications company that was looking for a United States presence, Deutsche Telekom of Germany.</p>
        <p>SBC and BellSouth hope to win approval for their venture from the Federal Communications Commission by the beginning of October.</p>
        <p>To compete against other national wireless providers like Verizon, AT&amp;T and Sprint, the SBC-BellSouth venture hopes to acquire wireless licenses in the parts of the nation where it now has none.</p>
        <p>NTT DoCoMo's deep pockets could help the venture acquire the additional licenses it desires, which could cost billions of dollars.</p>
