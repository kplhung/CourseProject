        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>ALBANY: FIRE CLOSES BUILDINGS  Two state office buildings were evacuated yesterday after an electrical fire filled them with smoke. Nine hundred people working for various state agencies have offices in the two 23-story towers across from the Capitol, but it is unclear how many were in the building. Peter Constantakes, a spokesman for the Office of General Services, said the fire started around 2 p.m. in the basement of one tower, as workers carried out routine maintenance on electric cables. He said three people were treated at Albany Medical Center for minor injuries. No time was given for the buildings to reopen.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: VOLPE CHALLENGE DENIED  A federal appeals court in Manhattan yesterday rejected the challenge of a former police officer, Justin A. Volpe, left, to his 30-year prison term for assaulting Abner Louima. A court panel said that Mr. Volpe's arguments -- one of which was that he had accepted responsibility for his crime -- had no merit. Marvyn Kornberg, Mr. Volpe's lawyer, said he would ask the full appellate court to reconsider, would appeal to the United States Supreme Court or would return to Judge Eugene H. Nickerson, the trial judge.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: 3 INDICTED IN WEB SWINDLE  Three New York men have been indicted on charges that they stole $5.5 million from more than 200 investors who thought they were financing an Internet gem dealership and art gallery, federal authorities said yesterday. The men sent the money to overseas accounts and spent some of it in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, according to a two-count indictment filed by the United States attorney's office and a civil suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ruslan Rapoport will plead not guilty, his lawyer said. Lawyers for the other defendants, Igor and Edward Landenbaum of Brooklyn, who are brothers, declined to comment.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: WOMAN KILLED BY TRUCK  An 80-year-old woman was killed yesterday when a produce truck struck her near 20th Street and Ninth Avenue, the police said. A friend of the family said that the woman, Faye Schreiber, was walking from her apartment on Ninth Avenue to a center for the elderly. The truck, a 1996 Chevrolet van registered to the Geko Corporation, collided with a 1996 Nissan, the police said, then spun around and struck Ms. Schreiber. The two drivers and three passengers from the car were taken to St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center, where they were listed in stable condition.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: H.M.O. SUIT DISMISSED  A federal judge has dismissed the state's lawsuit against Physicians Health Services. The lawsuit, filed in December, asserted that Physicians Health Services, Connecticut's largest H.M.O., pressured patients to use company-preferred drugs instead of doctor-prescribed medication that could be more effective. The lawsuit also charged that in determining which drugs to cover, the company judged by price instead of quality. The suit raised ''legitimate and serious'' concerns, Judge Stefan R. Underhill said, but a federal statute prohibits Connecticut from suing H.M.O.'s. An appeal is planned.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: 911 CENTER INVESTIGATED  The arrest of a Hartford police dispatcher charged with releasing secret computer data to her imprisoned husband has prompted a complete review of the operations of the state's busiest municipal 911 center. Hartford's acting police chief, Robert S. Rudewicz, said that an inspection of the dispatch center had already been planned, but that accusations charging the dispatcher, Arlene Davila, with conveyig information while on duty to her husband, Jose Davila, a convicted drug dealer, had accelerated that plan.</p>

        <p>ELLINGTON: TORNADO HITS, BUT NO ONE IS HURT  A tornado touched down in Ellington early yesterday afternoon, lifting trailers and damaging a cow barn, but injuring no one. The tornado was classified as an F1, or a moderate tornado, said Dave Henry, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass. Winds were between 72 and 112 miles per hour, he said. Mr. Henry said the tornado's path was 1 1/2 miles long and 40 yards wide. It started in a field and moved across a road and into a grassy lot filled with show trailers. Witnesses reported hearing loud noises and feeling strong winds. Some said they saw a funnel cloud. The winds were strong enough to lift a 1,300-pound trailer 30 feet in the air and drop it back on the ground.</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>NEWARK: AIRPORT CRIME DOWN  Crime at Newark, La Guardia and Kennedy Airports dropped 13 percent in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airports. Crimes like luggage theft and auto theft dropped 31.4 percent at Newark, 8.7 percent at La Guardia, and 4.2 percent at Kennedy. The chief of the Port Authority police, Fred V. Morrone, attributed the declines to the effectiveness of the security force as well as to the strong economy and high employment rates, which experts cite for a decline in crime nationally.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: LENDING PRACTICES CRITICIZED  New Jersey residents are complaining of being lured into costly financing arrangements by unscrupulous contractors, and of being required by lenders to pay higher interest rates than originally promised, according to testimony at public hearings arranged by the State Banking and Insurance Department. Consumer advocates, like New Jersey Citizen Action, called on the department to support legislation to crack down on such practices. Banks and other lenders said that more regulation was unnecessary.</p>

        <p>SADDLE RIVER: RAPPER'S FATHER FOUND  Two days after he was reported missing, the father of the hip-hop performer Wyclef Jean, left, reappeared, but without a public explanation for his absence. The Rev. Gesner Jean, 59, pastor of the Good Shepherd Church of the Nazarene, failed to return home on Sunday, and on Tuesday a relative called the police. Mr. Gesner was found at the family's home and taken to Valley Hospital in Ridgewood. Investigators do not suspect foul play, Police Chief Robert Re said.</p>
