        <p>By the late afternoon, most of the major World Wide Web news sites were no longer able to resist the struggle for life unfolding at the bottom of the Barents Sea.  While cable-news channels continued to feature drama-free images from the Democratic National Convention, on the Internet the news from the stricken Russian submarine had taken the lead position on the CBS, MSNBC, Fox News and CNN sites. ''No Signs of Life'' was the Fox site's headline.</p>
        <p>Of the major network sites, only ABC continued to cling to the convention as its lead item, offering the insight that, yes, now is the time for Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut to introduce themselves to the American people. As John Tyson, one of the vice president's college roommates, described it to MSNBC this evening, the final two days of the convention will provide ''a good strong dose of Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>That was the theme emphasized on every single one of the Web sites and by the cable anchors. Most often, it quickly led to the unanswerable question of whether Mr. Gore would be able to rise to the occasion and make himself appear sufficiently presidential to improve his poll numbers. Bring on the pundits!</p>
        <p>By evening, some of the sites (Fox and CBS) had finally come around to leading with their own Lieberman pieces. But the general lack of drama in Los Angeles was perhaps best exemplified by CNN's extensive coverage of the arrival of Mr. Gore's jet at Burbank Airport. For what seemed like hours, Air Force Two taxied down the runway and then sat on the tarmac, the camera focused on the dark, gaping doorway, waiting for someone, anyone, to emerge.</p>
        <p>Two weeks of trying to watch first the Republican and then the Democratic national conventions by flipping back and forth between cable and broadcast channels and surfing the Web have shown how the widely lamented absence of news at the conventions has often led news organizations to a near-crippling dependency on commentary to fill the dead air.</p>
        <p>When news actually did break, like the clash between the police and protesters on Monday night outside the convention hall, the tendency of most of the channels was to show a few quick images and then to ask the commentators, who had no idea what was actually happening, what they thought the clash meant.</p>
        <p>The Web, while promising a greater degree of immediacy and immersion for convention junkies, most often turned out to be little more than electronic journals, closer to what might be found in a weekly magazine than on a live television report.</p>
        <p>Many sites tried to make their points by adding little games and puzzles and quizzes -- and some of these were actually not half bad.</p>
        <p>MSNBC, for instance, had something called Electoral Chess in which an Internet user could predict which states each presidential candidate might win in November and see if it would be enough to get their candidate the presidency.</p>
        <p>Democracy Now had a protesters' version of Monopoly in which users were offered the chance to ''buy a politician today!''</p>
        <p>Donors offering hefty contributions were greeted with messages like: ''Welcome to the White House. Thank you for your donations. You may drop by anytime you want!''</p>
        <p>David Carr, writing on Inside.com, had fun predicting how the major news outlets would cover the Democratic convention, day by day. Today's reports, he predicted, would center on the vice president's efforts to finish writing his acceptance speech. ''Every one of the major papers in America will buy into the transparent canard that Gore -- a man who does push-polling on his choice of neckwear -- is working the speech all by his lonesome, revising draft after draft deep into the night,'' Mr. Carr wrote.</p>
        <p>And the chats continued. ABC's Sam Donaldson, who has taken to the Web with an eager-beaverness second to none, has chatted incessantly every night of both conventions. When his guest Harry Thomason, the Hollywood producer and pal of President Clinton, asked Mr. Donaldson how many people were actually out there listening to them jabber, Mr. Donaldson had to admit that he didn't really know, but it was far, far fewer than were watching the networks. It didn't matter, though, Mr. Donaldson said. ''We are the acorn and from this acorn will grow a mighty oak,'' he said.</p>
