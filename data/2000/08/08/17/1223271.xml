        <p>This is a 30-second advertisement, titled ''Effective,'' that Representative Rick A. Lazio's Senate campaign began showing in upstate New York markets yesterday and will be shown in the rest of the state today. It comes as Mr. Lazio continues a bus tour of the state that began yesterday and is to conclude on Monday. Mr. Lazio's aides said the advertisement, produced last month, was not timed to coincide with the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, where Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Lazio's opponent, spoke on Monday night. It is a response, they said, to what they consider to be Mrs. Clinton's distortion of Mr. Lazio's record.</p>

        <p>This is a 30-second advertisement, titled ''Effective,'' that Representative Rick A. Lazio's Senate campaign began showing in upstate New York markets yesterday and will be shown in the rest of the state today. It comes as Mr. Lazio continues a bus tour of the state that began yesterday and is to conclude on Monday. Mr. Lazio's aides said the advertisement, produced last month, was not timed to coincide with the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, where Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Lazio's opponent, spoke on Monday night. It is a response, they said, to what they consider to be Mrs. Clinton's distortion of Mr. Lazio's record.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The advertisement opens with a narrator reading a list of bills that Mr. Lazio sponsored as the titles pop up on a black screen. Toward the end, close-up shots of Mr. Lazio appear, taken from an Independence Day parade he attended during a statewide tour last month.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''The Quality Housing Act, to dramatically improve public housing. The Empowering Our Educators Act, to get better-trained teachers into the classrooms. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, to help low-income women get treatment.'' (On screen, the titles: Small Business Tax Fairness Act, the Senior Citizens Protection Act, the Quality Child Care Loan Forgiveness Act.) ''These are all significant pieces of legislation that have passed the U.S. Congress. Who is the congressman behind all this legislation? Rick Lazio, eight very effective years in Congress. Rick Lazio, from New York, for New York.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The narrator says Mr. Lazio is behind the legislation, but Mrs. Clinton's staff disputed some of his claims, and his press office released a statement indicating that he had supported rather than sponsored some of the bills, like the Breast Cancer Treatment Act. While Mr. Lazio did sponsor a bill to improve public housing, Democrats say he adopted some proposals they had made years before and fought to keep some other provisions that housing advocates said would push the poor out. The Empowering Our Educators Act, Mrs. Clinton's staff said, was never signed into law by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The advertisement, with its stark parade of bill titles, succeeds in emphasizing what Mr. Lazio considers legislative achievements, a pointed contrast to Mrs. Clinton, who has never held elected office. (Mrs. Clinton in the last week has said she acted as a closeted senior adviser to the president, helping to advocate and sometimes write legislation particularly addressing the needs of children and women.) But the legislation Mr. Lazio plays up is not the type that grabs headlines and will do little to stop Democrats from calling him a mediocre legislator unfit to fill the big shoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the retiring senator whose seat Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton are seeking.</p>
