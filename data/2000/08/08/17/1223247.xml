        <p>Merrill Lynch still wants to help its small-business customers get good deals on office supplies. But it no longer is the place for individual investors to turn for bargains on blazers or to bid on Beanie Babies.

''Basically, what we're doing is refocusing the e-commerce efforts on business-to-business instead of business-to-consumer,'' said James Wiggins, a Merrill spokesman. ''After experimenting for a while, we made a determination that there wasn't a huge demand for the shopping sites.''</p>
