        <p>HARSHA KUMAR, a 29-year-old technology officer for an e-commerce company in Westborough, Mass., wanted to find a wife. And Mr. Kumar, who was born in India and educated in the United States, wanted to begin his search in a way that blended both Old and New World sensibilities.</p>
        <p>''I knew I wanted to marry an Indian or Indian-American woman, but arranged marriage seemed unnatural to me,'' Mr. Kumar said. ''Meeting someone online seemed more natural to me, maybe because I work in e-commerce and am on the Internet and using e-mail a lot already.''</p>
        <p>In January 1998, Mr. Kumar signed up with Internet Matrimonials (matrimonials .com), a service for people of South Asian heritage. Traditionally, many South Asians have arranged marriages through relatives or ''marriage bureaus,'' paid matchmakers sometimes called bride brokers. In addition, publications like India Abroad and The Times of India have carried classified ads usually placed by parents looking for serious prospective brides and grooms. But in the last few years, matrimonial Web sites have offered an alternative.</p>
        <p>Internet Matrimonials says that it receives nearly 40,000 visits a month. The site charges customers $30 apiece to advertise themselves to potential spouses by indicating their religion, occupation, cultural background and location.</p>
        <p>Through Internet Matrimonials, Mr. Kumar began sending e-mail to a law student in Bombay named Hema Sastry twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. They found that beyond having compatible biodata  -- the term used for the resume-like summaries used in each matrimonial ad for each person's caste, education and physical attributes -- they also shared an interest in Indian music.</p>
        <p>They soon exchanged photographs by mail. In February 1999, Mr. Kumar decided to make the trip to India to meet Ms. Sastry in person. They became engaged and in December 1999 were married in India. Mr. Kumar's wife then moved to the United States.</p>
        <p>''Some people might think it's crazy that we began our relationship via e-mail,'' Mr. Kumar said. ''But I think we communicated more than some people who date one another once a week. We probably even communicated more than we do now, living in the same house as a husband and wife who get too busy caught up with work and errands.''</p>
        <p>Matrimonial Web sites seem to strike a compromise between ancient South Asian social traditions and the contemporary attitudes of many Indian- and Pakistani-Americans by cutting out the intermediary of arranged marriages: the family. Just as online trading is starting to cut out the middleman in the investing business, the  Web is being used to help arrange marriages without help from relatives or marriage bureaus. The sites can be particularly useful for South Asians abroad; in 1998 alone, 36,500 Indians and 13,100 Pakistanis moved to the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kumar said his parents had not been put off by his lack of interest in a traditional arranged marriage.</p>
        <p>''They got what they wanted and I got what I wanted, and the match was even better, I think, than either an arranged marriage or a 'love marriage,' '' Mr. Kumar said, using a term for unarranged marriages that result from dating. Love marriages are still looked down upon by some conservative South Asian families, both in this country and abroad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kumar's experience was so positive that he recommended the Internet Matrimonials site to his sister, Reshma, who also lives in the United States. She met her husband through the same service.</p>
        <p>The most popular of the hundreds of matrimonial sites on the Web include Internet Matrimonials, A1 Matrimonials (www .a1im.com), IndianMarriages (www .indianmarriages.com) and Suitable Match (www.suitablematch.com). Most sites offer some free services, like letting people  search their bride and groom databases, and allow users to post photos and descriptive paragraphs about themselves for prospective marriage partners only.</p>
        <p>A1 Matrimonials explicitly states that ''no dating ads will be allowed.'' IndianMarriages invites individuals and parents as well as marriage bureaus to log on. The site offers simple, advanced and keyword searches. Users enter or search for information in fields like ''age'' and ''caste,'' but they can also search for more detailed information like ''wears turban.'' A ''deluxe'' paid account allows users to use e-mail to get in contact with those whose ads are posted. People can peruse the database free.</p>
        <p>Marriage sites cater to a technologically sophisticated population. According to Forrester Research, 69 percent of Asian-American households are online, compared with 43 percent of the general population.</p>
        <p>''We feel like we're helping Indians and Indian-Americans help qualify or reject potential mates faster than ever before,'' said Nahrain Bhatia, who founded Suitable Match, a heavily visited site with 10,000 registered members. He came up with the idea for the site after he realized that his American-born daughters were of marriageable age and that he was not sure where they might find Indian-American husbands.</p>
        <p>''I think there's a real transition occurring in the way people of Indian descent find their spouses,'' Mr. Bhatia said. ''They are generally busy professionals. They need the process to become more efficient and more effective. Plus, most of the Indian-Americans who are online are young and educated -- quite an attractive pool of marriage candidates.''</p>
        <p>Bharat Manglani, an Indian immigrant and the president of Asian Matches (www .asianmatches.com), which also runs the Suitable Match site, says that online services can streamline the marriage process. Mr. Manglani's own parents spent three years finding a wife for him. When they finally found her through a newspaper ad, it took six months for the families to arrange to introduce the future bride and groom to each other in person.</p>
        <p>''If we can reduce a six-month process to six days, think of how much easier we can make finding a mate,'' Mr. Manglani said.  ''I mean, a successful marriage is all about sheer luck. Wouldn't it be better to be up front about whether or not a bride or groom won't work as quickly as possible? Then our clients could move on and just get that much closer to finding the right person, get married and get on with their lives.''</p>
        <p>Achla Sagal, 30, a second-generation Indian-American lawyer in Dayton, Ohio, had considered an arranged marriage, but after seven years of her parents' hunting in vain for her ideal groom, she grew frustrated.  Ms. Sagal surfed the Web until she found two free sites, A1 Matrimonials and IndianMarriages, and placed ads with them. Ms. Sagal said her parents were eager to see their daughter married and support her online quest for a husband.</p>
        <p>''I figured that without parental buffers, I might be able to more easily find an Indian-American who genuinely wanted to get married to another Indian-American,'' Ms. Sagal said. She had tired of offline meetings with marriage candidates who, after formal introductions with both sets of parents and other relatives in the same room, would admit that they were there only out of obligation to their families.</p>
        <p>''Online, the contact between me and a potential groom is much more direct,'' said Ms. Sagal, who has yet to find a groom. She has had responses from more than 25 potential grooms and has corresponded with 10.</p>
        <p>The online options for finding a mate  might seem very modern, but they represent an acceptance of the prejudices of previous generations. Looking for a spouse through such strict criteria as caste or subcaste, graduate degrees or even lightness of complexion (common fields on most  matrimonial sites) echoes the strict categories that traditional South Asian parents and marriage bureaus have used for centuries.</p>
        <p>''In the end, I feel like using online matrimonial sites is hypocritical,'' said Koki Jhumra, a 22-year-old Pakistani-American who works as a Web site developer in Cambridge, Mass. ''Basically you're engaging in a meat hunt, like you would in a bar, even though that's what you're theoretically trying to avoid.''Ms. Jhumra said she had tried a matrimonial site and had been disappointed when a potential mate she met online decided that she was too young.</p>
        <p>''And it's funny,'' Ms. Jhumra said, ''because at the same time you're trying to meet people online by prescreening them by the same biases -- like someone's age, education, social status or wealth -- used by your parents and marriage bureaus alike, rather than finding out if you have things in common and communicate well.''</p>
        <p>Still, Kirin Narayan, a professor of anthropology and languages and cultures of Asia at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said that South Asian matrimonial Web sites could catch on.</p>
        <p>''Marriages to an appropriate person of the right religion, region, caste, subcaste and so on used to be arranged through the intermediaries of elders and matchmakers who were linked in local networks,'' Professor Narayan said. ''In more impersonal settings, like cities, matrimonial advertising through newspapers could forge new links and expand the range of available prospects beyond existing networks.''</p>
        <p>That view was echoed by Anne Monius, an assistant professor at the Center for South Asian Studies at the University of Virginia who lectures on arranged marriage.</p>
        <p>''Indian parents who are immigrants might not have the network in the States necessary to arrange a marriage easily,'' she said. ''These Web sites can help because they offer a controlled environment, in terms of a somewhat screened community.''</p>
        <p>Even operators of reputable marriage bureaus are turning to the Web to reach unattached South Asians and South Asian-Americans. Falguni Mehta, who has run a marriage bureau that bears her name in Bombay for more than 12 years and says she has arranged more than 5,000 marriages, started her own Web site (www.falgunimehta.com) in 1997. Since going online, she said, she has arranged five to seven marriages a month via the Web. Most clients have been Indian-Americans.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Mehta posts information only on clients whose backgrounds she has checked. ''I make the first inquiry about a bride or groom's background,'' Mrs. Mehta said, ''and I've built up a trustworthy reputation with a traditional marriage bureau over the years. But on these other sites, people can manipulate the truth quite easily, and there is no one who can monitor that.''</p>
        <p>Although his parents weren't pressuring him to marry, Manish Vij, the 27-year-old founder and vice president for marketing at Pointera, a Silicon Valley company, posted an ad with Internet Matrimonials out of curiosity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vij noticed that certain terms kept surfacing in the ads placed by divorced women. ''Issueless divorce,'' he deduced, stands for ''no children,'' while ''innocently divorced'' means ''still a virgin.'' Both terms can easily be searched for on most sites.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vij said he would prefer meeting his wife offline. ''I'd rather feel chemistry,'' he said, ''which one might experience meeting a woman not only at a party but also in an arranged meeting set up by relatives.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 22, 2000, Tuesday  An article and a picture caption in Circuits on Thursday about matchmaking Web sites for South Asians misspelled the surname of a woman who is using two sites to seek a husband. She is Achla Sahgal, not Sagal.</p>
