        <p>Cindy Williams Op-Ed article on increasing pay gap between military personnel and civilian counterparts says Republican contention that Clinton administration has eroded America's defenses is misplaced noting when Pres Clinton took office pay gap was already 11.5 percent, all accumulated in Bush and Reagan presidencies (M)</p>

        <p>Democrats are saying this week in Los Angeles that the military is strong and fit, while campaigning Republicans contend that the Clinton administration has run America's defenses down. It's a complex issue, but in at least one aspect -- military pay -- Republican scorn is misplaced. The G.O.P. platform says Americans in uniform face a 13 percent ''pay gap'' relative to their civilian counterparts. But when President Clinton took office, the gap was already 11.5 percent, all accumulated in the Reagan and Bush presidencies.</p>
        <p>The gap the Republicans cite does not reflect a direct calculation of pay differences between the military and the private sector; it compares pay raises since 1982. Proponents of higher military pay like to use that year as their starting point because it makes the gap look as large as possible. Basically, their calculation presumes that since the draft was abolished in 1973, the military has been paid fairly only once: in 1982, after two years of double-digit pay increases under Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.</p>

        <p>Democrats are saying this week in Los Angeles that the military is strong and fit, while campaigning Republicans contend that the Clinton administration has run America's defenses down. It's a complex issue, but in at least one aspect -- military pay -- Republican scorn is misplaced. The G.O.P. platform says Americans in uniform face a 13 percent ''pay gap'' relative to their civilian counterparts. But when President Clinton took office, the gap was already 11.5 percent, all accumulated in the Reagan and Bush presidencies.</p>
        <p>The gap the Republicans cite does not reflect a direct calculation of pay differences between the military and the private sector; it compares pay raises since 1982. Proponents of higher military pay like to use that year as their starting point because it makes the gap look as large as possible. Basically, their calculation presumes that since the draft was abolished in 1973, the military has been paid fairly only once: in 1982, after two years of double-digit pay increases under Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>In the 1983 budget, Mr. Reagan struck a bargain with Congress to limit the military's pay raise to 4 percent, even though civilian wage growth was twice that high. That created the gap -- at 4 percent.</p>
        <p>The gap continued to widen throughout the 1980's; the military received raises that were generally smaller than those in the private sector.</p>
        <p>Republicans might of course point out that Democratic Congresses passed the pay bills. But year after year, Republican defense secretaries specifically requested raises for the military that lagged behind the private sector. Most of the time, Congress authorized what was requested.</p>
        <p>The emergence of the so-called pay gap did not signal that Mr. Reagan and President George Bush did not respect or appreciate the military; nor does its small growth under Mr. Clinton mean that he has run the military down.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's and 1990's, administrations and Congresses worked to strike a balance between the military's needs and the urgency of reducing federal deficits. At the same time, defense commanders tried to balance the military's needs. Good pay is one of several tools to attract and retain capable troops. As long as the services were able to do this, pay raises were capped in favor of spending on weapons, force structure and training. When recruiting and retention faltered, defense leaders added more to pay and other benefits.</p>
        <p>The strategy paid off. In the Persian Gulf war, with the reported pay gap already at more than 11 percent, the United States fielded the best equipped and trained fighting forces in the world.</p>
        <p>This year, after two years of weakness in recruiting, all four services appear to be meeting their goals. If that success continues, the Pentagon's priorities may swing again, and future military officials may choose to devote scarce resources to something else besides pay increases.</p>
