        <p>Shares of Juno Online Services surged 24 percent, to $6.125, yesterday after the company announced a promotional agreement with I.B.M., similar to those between other top Internet service providers and computer makers, that analysts said would probably be expensive for Juno. Juno, based in New York, said its free basic service would be distributed to buyers of I.B.M. computers, including NetVista and Aptiva desktop models and I Series ThinkPad portable computers. While Juno did not give the specific terms of the deal, analysts who cover computer makers and those who cover Internet service providers both said it probably involved sizable payments to I.B.M., in line with an industry trend.</p>
