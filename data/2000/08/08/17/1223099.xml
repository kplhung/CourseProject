        <p>The more you use the Net, the more likely you are to be in touch with friends and relatives, whether in person, by phone or by e-mail. At least that's what Keith Hampton, an assistant professor in the department of urban studies and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Barry Wellman, a sociology professor at the University of Toronto, found after analyzing a survey of 40,456 North Americans.</p>

        <p>The more you use the Net, the more likely you are to be in touch with friends and relatives, whether in person, by phone or by e-mail. At least that's what Keith Hampton, an assistant professor in the department of urban studies and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Barry Wellman, a sociology professor at the University of Toronto, found after analyzing a survey of 40,456 North Americans.</p>
        <p>''It's clear that people who e-mail also talk more in person and on the phone,'' Mr. Hampton said.</p>
        <p>According to the survey, which was presented at the American Sociological Association's annual meeting, which ended yesterday, people who used the Internet only once or twice a year had 471 contacts of all kinds with friends and relatives who lived within 30 miles.</p>
        <p>Daily Internet users, by contrast, exchanged e-mail or had conversations -- either in person or by phone -- with nearby friends and relatives 1,312 times.</p>
        <p>The contrast became even more striking for more distant friends and family members. People who rarely used the Net got in touch only about 75 times a year. Heavy Net users, however, had 997 exchanges a year. The two researchers considered about 40 Internet- and community-related questions that were included in a survey partly sponsored by the National Geographic Society and carried on its Web site in October 1998.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wellman said other data from the study suggested that e-mail was not, however, dislodging traditional forms of communications among  friends and family members. ''The Internet is a huge add-on,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Could it just be that heavy Internet users are just naturally more friendly -- or chatty? ''I don't think you can tell at this point if people who go online are inherently more communicative,'' Mr. Hampton said.</p>

        <p>NEWS WATCH  Correction:  August 25, 2000, Friday  A brief article in Circuits on Aug. 17 about a study showing that regular Internet users stay in greater touch with family and friends than infrequent users included incorrect figures from an author of the study. (The study's conclusions were unaffected.)</p>
        <p>Daily Internet users in the study had, on average, 583 contacts of all kinds per year with friends and relatives living within 30 miles, not 1,312. People who used the Internet one or two times a year had an average of 396 contacts, not 471. Daily Internet users had 266 contacts with more distant friends and relatives, not 997. People who used the Internet once or twice a year had 99 such contacts, not 75.</p>
