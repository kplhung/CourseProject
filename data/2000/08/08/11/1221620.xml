        <p>''My other car is a broom.''</p>
        <p>''Rush is right.''</p>
        <p>''Visualize world peace'' (or whirled peas).</p>
        <p>LONG before Internet chat and constant-talk radio, Americans expressed themselves on their cars. The Vietnam war was debated on chrome: the peace symbols of the left versus the red, white and blue slogans of the right. In 1972, the Texas Memorial Museum in Austin examined the trend with an exhibit, ''Bumper Stickers: A History of 20 Turbulent Years.'' And that was before President Nixon's detractors came up with the self-congratulatory, ''Don't Blame Me -- I Voted McGovern.''</p>
        <p>But as times have calmed and road manners have declined, bumpers travel stickerless in much of the country. Not only do fewer motorists show their political stripes, but fewer jalopies proclaim, ''This car climbed Mount Washington.'' Drivers are seldom asked if they hugged their kids today.</p>
        <p>''Fewer people are putting stickers on their cars,'' said Paul Rosa, owner of Idiot Ink, a maker of bumper stickers in Manhattan. ''There are very few people making a living from this.''</p>
        <p>Today's cars are partly responsible, those in the business say. Contoured, plastic-coated bumpers seem more sacrosanct than the metal appendages of yesteryear. Those who lease are reluctant to make adhesive-backed statements, since any residual damage can cost them at the end of the term.</p>
        <p>Still, there are die-hards. Robert Kempton of Staten Island has 15 Christian-theme stickers on the back of his Plymouth Voyager, including ''Eternity: Smoking or Non-Smoking?'' He recently bought two more.</p>
        <p>In addition to spreading the gospel, ''they keep me out of trouble,'' Mr. Kempton said. ''I can't pull into a bar.''</p>
        <p>But many motorists, mindful of road rage and political polarization, seem reluctant to wear their hearts on their cars' sleeves. ''If a person sees another person with a Hillary Clinton bumper sticker, and they don't like her, they might bump the car,'' said Alan Handell, owner of Zale Koff Graphics in Manhattan, which makes stickers and other materials for Democratic candidates.</p>
        <p>Other reasons have more to do with the bottom line of modern campaigns. Orders at Mr. Handell's company have dropped 50 percent in five years. Money that campaigns once spent on printed materials has gone to television, radio and the Internet.</p>
        <p>First used in Warren G. Harding's successful presidential campaign of 1920, bumper stickers became a fixture with the 1952 Eisenhower-Stevenson race, said Edmund Sullivan, former director of the Museum of American Political Life in West Hartford, Conn. They thrived until 1976.</p>
        <p>Gil Troy, a professor of history at McGill University in Montreal and author of ''See How They Ran,'' a history of American presidential electioneering, said the turning point came during Jimmy Carter's presidential bid. Under severe budget constraints, the Carter campaign decided bumper stickers were a luxury and used the money for television instead.</p>
        <p>But there was a backlash, Dr. Troy said. ''Party operatives and people involved in grass-roots campaigning wanted the bumper stickers, the buttons, the stupid little hats,'' he said. Some money was restored.</p>
        <p>Dr. Troy said demand for stickers subsided in subsequent presidential races. Now, he says, the only place where he sees many campaign stickers is in Washington, where their display by those in political jobs ''is more calculated than passionate,'' or at the national political conventions.</p>
        <p>Mark Weiner, president of Financial Innovations Inc. in Cranston, R.I., which has produced Democratic merchandise since 1980, said, ''Definitely, the use of bumper stickers has been down in the last eight years.'' Still, he said, stickers are popular in ''politically active'' areas like Ohio and Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiner's company sells Gore campaign stickers and other paraphernalia through its Web site, www.goregoods.com. A single bumper sticker is $4 plus $4.95 for shipping; another site, www.goregear.com, sells stickers for $1 plus $2 shipping.</p>
        <p>Enthusiasm for a candidate plays a role, Mr. Weiner said, noting that at least 10 million bumper stickers were produced for President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign, high by contemporary standards.</p>
        <p>This year, sticker orders indicate enthusiasm for the Republican ticket, said Ted Jackson, owner of the Spalding Group in Louisville, Ky., the sole licensee for the George W. Bush campaign. ''This is like 1984, the Reagan re-election,'' said Mr. Jackson, adding that demand is far stronger than it was for the Dole candidacy four years ago. His company's web site, www.georgewbushstore.com. sells stickers in minimum orders of 25 at 75 cents each; one comes free with every order of other goods, like Bush polo shirts or bottled water.</p>
        <p>For other types of stickers, too, strong sentiments tend to get bumper space. Religious themes remain popular, along with pro-choice and anti-abortion slogans, but sexual references and profanity are gaining.</p>
        <p>''The best sellers are in-your-face,'' said Mr. Rosa of Idiot Ink, which sells through Sam Goody music stores and Spencer Gifts. Mr. Rosa started his business 10 years ago, selling his first sticker (''My kid beat up your honor student'') at comedy clubs where he performed. Tastes have coarsened since. His current No. 1 sticker involves beer, sex and ugly people.</p>
        <p>A New York FM station has taken advantage of the trend. WNEW's ''WOW'' stickers seem innocent enough, but those familiar with an afternoon show on that station recognize the initials as a reference to a campaign urging women to bare their breasts.</p>
        <p>''I've done a lot of promotions, but this one is phenomenal,'' said Ken Stevens, the station's general manager. ''You see them everywhere.'' He said the campaign, which has been criticized as offensive to women, has shown that people will use a bumper sticker ''only if they're passionate about it.''</p>
        <p>For decades, average Americans felt that passion for politics, said Dr. Troy, the historian. ''It was the national pastime.'' These days, ''we brand ourselves less politically than stylistically,'' he said. ''Now shopping is the national pastime.''</p>
