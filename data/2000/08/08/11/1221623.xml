        <p>IN a sly, perfectly timed nod to reality, the TNT film ''Running Mates'' presents Tom Selleck as a candidate, James Pryce, who goes to the Democratic convention at the Staples Center in Los Angeles (where the actual Democratic convention begins on Monday). He has sewn up the presidential nomination, and the event will be, as the film puts it, ''a virtual coronation.''</p>
        <p>At the movie's turning point, Pryce is watching the television news, sees that an abortion clinic has been bombed and stomps out of his hotel room to go there. Aides try to hold him back, saying: ''Do we really have to get into this? It'll cost us.'' But the indignant candidate says, ''If I'm going to run the country I'm going to have to exercise an opinion at some point.'' Forget ''the damn polls,'' he adds. Realism? There's a better chance of a campaign getting soft money donations from Mars.</p>
        <p>Then the film tops itself. At the clinic Pryce actually tells a gaggle of television cameramen, ''Why don't you turn those things off?'' He has definitely become the candidate from another planet.</p>
        <p>Or, as one ad for the movie (to be shown Sunday night on TNT) puts it with unintended meaning, ''Meet the candidate of your dreams.'' He is the idealized fantasy figure of so much political fiction: high-minded, ignoring polls, yet with a sexual history that makes him human. Of course the fictional Pryce never takes a stand on the abortion issue. (That would cost him with the movie's audience, one way or another.) He does firmly -- and heroically, the film would have us believe -- offer the opinion that bombing is bad. And when he delivers a climactic speech, he talks about ''the people'' being disenfranchised by ''the powerful,'' the inoffensive political equivalent of a nondenominational prayer.</p>
        <p>The tepid ''Running Mates'' flounders because it is never sure whether it wants to be satire or romantic sitcom (Pryce is surrounded by women from his past) or political drama (he is offered $100 million to choose the contributors' man as vice president). But these telling central scenes reveal the soul of the film, which is part of a feast of recent and forthcoming political drama on television and film, in theater and books. (Several of the films will be on television this weekend.)</p>
        <p>They are as up-to-the-minute as television's ''West Wing,'' which continues to gain momentum as the season's biggest success, and as prescient as ''The Best Man,'' the Broadway revival of Gore Vidal's 1960 play. They include post-Lewinsky cultural criticism, as trenchant and enduring as that in Philip Roth's novel ''The Human Stain'' and as vapid and already dated as that in Joe Ezsterhas's fantasy memoir ''American Rhapsody.'' All reveal something about the changing image of the president and national politics and about the influence of the Clinton impeachment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth approaches the issue in an effectively skewed way. ''The Human Stain'' is about Coleman Silk, an academic forced to resign when he is accused (falsely, he believes) of using a racist word; who is having a quiet affair with an illiterate cleaning woman; and who has an even more inflammatory secret in his past. This tragedy  about political, racial and sexual hypocrisy is set in the summer of 1998, and Mr. Roth makes it clear that these events are part of the same cultural moment as the Lewinsky affair.</p>
        <p>''It was the summer in America when the nausea returned, when the joking didn't stop,'' the narrator, Nathan Zuckerman, says, ''when the smallness of people was simply crushing . . . and, on both sides, people wondered 'Why are we so crazy?' '' People woke in the morning to find ''they had dreamed of the brazenness of Bill Clinton.'' Zuckerman himself dreams of a banner draped across the White House reading: ''A HUMAN BEING LIVES HERE.''</p>
        <p>Most pop cultural versions of the president begin with a similar humanity, then create a fantasy. It is now a given in fiction and on screen that politics is a world of dirty tricks, scandal and compromise. The ideal is a president like Pryce, who has a sexual history but an insanely unrealistic idealism. He is human but also better than that. (The multilayered title of George Stephanopoulos's memoir captures the problem with real presidents: ''All Too Human.'')</p>
        <p>In ''Running Mates,'' Mr. Selleck is a good guy faced with a political dilemma: will he give in to the big money men, go along with their piggish vice presidential candidate and become president? Or will he choose the running mate so modest he stays at a Holiday Inn, and who may cost him the election? In a film of such predictable outcomes, this plot is not suspenseful.</p>
        <p>And Pryce's character is too whitewashed to be credible. In the  silliest scene, the women gather in the bathroom to discuss his performance in bed, but the conversation reveals that his affairs with his fund-raiser (Teri Hatcher), campaign manager (Laura Linney) and political mentor's wife (Faye Dunaway) all happened before he married. His devoted wife (Nancy Travis) is part of this supposedly jolly forgive-all conversation.</p>
        <p>Still, the film's grasp of image-making suggests how savvy viewers have become about that aspect of politics. They know that human failings are disguised for the sake of a political persona. Fiction simply polishes the hero's image more.</p>
        <p>Warren Beatty's 'Bulworth'</p>
        <p>Most films, like ''Running Mates,'' pander to the audience's wishes. The rare exception is Warren Beatty's underrated 1998 film ''Bulworth'' (he is star, director and a writer), one of the best political satires of recent years. He plays a California senator  running for re-election who at the start is sitting in his office watching his own campaign ad. He hears himself say, ''I believe in the old-fashioned values of honesty and decency and fidelity.'' He hears himself oppose affirmative action. He is weeping with disgust at the whole process, in the throes of an all-too-human meltdown.</p>
        <p>The funniest scenes are those in which the out-of-his-mind Bulworth starts rapping, telling the truth in a world where honesty equals political suicide. ''As long as you can pay, I'm gonna do it all your way,'' he says, chanting, ''Big money/ Big money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Beatty, in a brief interview on HBO, says, '' 'Bulworth' is a movie that you make when you know that you are not going to go out and try to get votes.'' Someone should have dug up that quote during his real-life, teasing flirtation with a presidential run last year.</p>
        <p>'The American President'</p>
        <p>The satire of ''Bulworth'' is more scathing than all the hollow speeches about people and power. The film has adult complexity and political opinions. So does ''The American President.'' When the film appeared in 1995, its most conspicuous element was the sentimental love-at-first-sight plot, in which the widowed president, Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas), dates an environmental lobbyist, Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening).</p>
        <p>Today the film, written by Aaron Sorkin (and directed by Rob Reiner), reads like a blueprint for Mr. Sorkin's creation ''The West Wing.'' It is filled with energetic White House staffers who are adept at polling, public relations and political arm twisting. Even the ''West Wing'' theme music echoes that of ''The American President,'' though NBC says they were written by two different people.</p>
        <p>At the start, the film focuses on the romance and wittily demonstrates the the president is not an ordinary human. ''I'm just a guy asking a girl over for a meal,'' he says, only to have Sydney ask about a sudden noise. ''That's my ride,'' he tells her, as a helicopter lands on the White House lawn.</p>
        <p>The film's villain, played by Richard Dreyfuss, is a presidential candidate who attacks their affair and speaks before the fictional Conservative Coalition of America. He asks, in a speech that sounds awfully similar to some heard at the Republican convention this month: ''Does New Hampshire want traditional American values back in the White House? Does New Hampshire want the pride back?''</p>
        <p>And when the Dreyfuss character invents sexual gossip about Sydney, the heroic Shepherd won't retaliate in kind. ''They're trying to get us to pitch the dirt.'' he says. ''Nobody wins these fights.''</p>
        <p>'The West Wing'</p>
        <p>All this became the successful formula for ''The West Wing,'' with Martin Sheen promoted from his role as chief of staff in ''The American President'' to president in the television series. His Josiah Bartlet is more stentorian and pompous than the regular-guy Shepherd, but they share a superhuman idealism. President Bartlet is widely seen as a key to the show's success, tempering its political realism with an idealized chief executive. This polished image of the president plays well with real-life politicians. In fact, on Sunday there will be a party on the ''West Wing'' set, with people from the real White House (including John Podesta, the chief of staff, and Joe Lockhart, the press secretary) visiting the fictional Oval Office.</p>
        <p>Though media attention to scandals has exploded in recent years, dirty politics is nothing new. ''The Best Man,'' which opens next month, may be a clumsy old play but it is timely. It will keep its original setting at a 1960 political convention in Philadelphia. Charles Durning plays an aging president whose term is running out. Spalding Gray and Chris Noth are the candidates fighting for his endorsement and the nomination who have dirt on each other. (One piece of information is sexual, the other about mental stability.) ''This is exactly the kind of thing I went into politics to stop!'' says Mr. Gray's character, the more reluctant to sling mud. ''The business of gossip instead of issues, personalities instead of policies.''</p>
        <p>Little has changed. In the forthcoming film ''The Contender,'' Joan Allen plays a senator named by the president (Jeff Bridges) to fill the dead vice president's slot. Gary Oldman is the political opposition who slimes her with her sexual past. ''Distortion. Deception. Manipulation,'' says the film's trailer, offering a catalog of politics as usual.</p>
        <p>The good guy in Joe's Klein's recent novel ''The Running Mate'' is Charlie Martin, a war-hero candidate in a tight Senate race. He wonders whether to use damaging information about his opponent's wife's abortion. And Martin's staff researches his own fiancee's past, to  protect themselves against damaging surprises. When she finds out she says, ''You put on a good act, Charlie, almost human.''</p>
        <p>This sluggish novel is not nearly as much fun as Mr. Klein's ''Primary Colors'' because it tries to graft the unconvincing romance onto politics but lacks the charm that allows ''The American President'' to get away with it.</p>
        <p>'Face-Time'</p>
        <p>Erik Tarloff's breezy, smart novel ''Face-Time'' is more entertaining. The narrator is a White House speechwriter named Ben whose girlfriend is having an affair with the president, who has distinctly Clintonian traits. Ben is drawn by the president's feel-their-pain sympathy for starving Africans, which he calls ''a reaction more human than political.''</p>
        <p>But this novel knowingly exploits the idea that the president is in a superhuman class of his own. ''How could I ever compete with someone who occupied such a position, regardless of who and what he was as a man?'' Ben wonders.</p>
        <p>His girlfriend pleads special circumstances. Getting any ''face-time'' with the president, much less sex time, is what she calls ''the Holy Grail'' in Washington.</p>
        <p>Politics can also be turned to nothing more than fun on screen. Jim Lehrer's ''Last Debate'' is a clunky novel, but its mischievous plot may work better in the forthcoming Showtime movie.</p>
        <p>James Garner and Audra McDonald play journalists who sabotage a presidential debate between a racist, media-made candidate who is poised to win and a good man who happens to be among the world's worst campaigners.</p>
        <p>Ladies' Men</p>
        <p>Simply latching on to the political moment isn't enough, though. In the fall television sitcom ''DAG,'' David Alan Grier is a Secret Service agent who almost botches the job of guarding the president and is demoted (yuk, yuk) to protecting the strong-willed first lady (Delta Burke).</p>
        <p>The Off Broadway play ''High Infidelity,'' now in previews, has a sitcom story, too. John Davidson plays a senator running for President and  Morgan Fairchild his wife. They go to counseling, determined to save the marriage for political reasons. As the corny title suggests, sexual secrets can't be far behind.</p>
        <p>But even a more pointed attempt at cultural criticism can fail to grasp the moment. In ''American Rhapsody'' Mr. Ezsterhas uses a he's-one-of-us baby boomer excuse to project his own ego on the Clinton years. Once you've heard about the tabloid-friendly parts (the monologue by the president's penis), the book's mixture of fantasy and supposed fact is tedious, with a rehash of the Lewinsky details that give new meaning to Clinton fatigue. Why bother with a book that takes everything in Gennifer Flowers's memoirs as absolute truth?</p>
        <p>The publisher lists ''American Rhapsody'' as nonfiction, and even stranger things have happened with political books lately. Last month, used bookstores had a run on a lame 1988 political novel ''The Body Politic'' because one of its authors is Lynne Cheney, wife of the Republican vice presidential candidate, Dick Cheney. The book's fictional vice president (like Mr. Cheney, 59 years old and a former secretary of defense) dies of a heart attack in an adulterous moment with a network anchorwoman.</p>
        <p>His savvy press director has little trouble pretending that the vice president is still alive because, as the book says, ''The vice presidency is the worst kind of career move. Under the Constitution, the only thing the job calls for is waiting: waiting for the president to die or to be impeached.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes the winds of political reality blow into fiction, wittingly or not. But the best political drama treats its audience as grown-ups and its characters as human, or at least partly human.</p>
