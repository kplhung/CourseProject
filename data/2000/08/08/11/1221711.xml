        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>CHENEYS STUMP IN OHIO  Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne, visited an elementary school yesterday in Pickerington, Ohio, a largely Republican suburb of Columbus, to hammer home the importance of reading -- and Gov. George W. Bush's broader emphasis on education. ''The single most significant problem we face,'' Mr. Cheney said, ''is finding skilled, trained people to fill the jobs that are out there. But oftentimes our schools have failed us. What's the source of the failure? Lots of time the kids can't read. If we don't get those children reading by the third grade, all the evidence shows that it's very hard to get them back into the system and benefit from education.''</p>

        <p>Under Mr. Bush's plan, federal financing would be withheld if schools failed to meet state testing standards. Parents could then use that money to hire tutors, send their children to charter schools or pay tuition at private schools.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>CARDINAL WILL DELIVER INVOCATION AT CONVENTION  Cardinal Roger Mahony of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, who denounced the 1998 political campaigns as disturbingly ''antilife,'' will deliver an invocation at the Democratic National Convention on Monday. Cardinal Mahony, 64, an increasingly influential member of the American Catholic hierarchy, accepted a surprise invitation this week from Vice President Al Gore's office, a spokesman for the archdiocese said yesterday. Days after the 1998 elections, Cardinal Mahony criticized candidates across the political spectrum for appearing to ''be engaged in a race to see who would go the extra mile in advancing policies that undermine the sanctity of life.''</p>

        <p>MOYNIHAN WILL STAY HOME  New York's senior senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 73, who is retiring, will miss the Democratic National Convention next week, preferring to spend time on his upstate farm with his two grandchildren and to work on his 19th book. Los Angeles, the site of the convention, is not really Mr. Moynihan's kind of town, according to Tony Bullock, the senator's chief of staff. Mr. Bullock added that the senator's plans did not reflect his feelings about the Gore-Lieberman ticket. Mr. Moynihan had endorsed Al Gore's primary opponent, Bill Bradley, and dismissed Mr. Gore as unelectable. After Mr. Bradley quit the race, Mr. Moynihan said Mr. Gore had evolved into an ''eminently electable'' candidate. The 500-acre Moynihan farm in Pindar's Corners is listed for sale. ''He's been to a lot of conventions,'' Mr. Bullock said. ''This is his last summer on the farm and he's got grandchildren to see.''</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>NADER WALKS THE LINE  Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential nominee, walked the picket line with striking telephone workers in Falls Church, Va., yesterday, looking for votes and saying he was unconcerned that the strikers' union had already endorsed Al Gore. ''That's to be expected,'' said Mr. Nader, who joined Communication Workers of America employees who are on strike against Verizon Communications, the company formed by the merger of GTE and Bell Atlantic. ''At the rank-and-file level, it's open competition,'' he said. ''The other candidates will not even talk about these issues.'' Those issues include federal labor law and corporate influence on public policy, centerpieces of his campaign. Mr. Nader planned to discuss tort law today, calling for changes to make it easier for consumers to sue corporations and win damages.</p>
