        <p>The billionaire club of America's Cup contenders appeared to become one member stronger yesterday.</p>
        <p>An announcement from San Francisco that Larry Ellison, the C.E.O. of Oracle Corp. and the owner of the maxiyacht Sayonara, had acquired the assets of Paul Cayard's America One syndicate seemed to strongly indicate that Ellison was on the verge of making an official challenge for the cup in New Zealand in 2003. No figures were divulged.</p>
        <p>Cayard, whose team advanced to the challenger's finals in last spring's cup before being eliminated by Italy's Prada Challenge, said Ellison had basically bought a complete America's Cup starter kit.</p>
        <p>''That includes our two America's Cup boats, our base in New Zealand, all the tools, sheds and sail loft,'' Cayard said. ''The whole package, really.''</p>
        <p>Neither Cayard nor Bill Erkelens, who until recently served as the Sayonara's captain, would comment on whether Ellison would have an on-the-water role.</p>
        <p>''He sailed in the 70's a bit, then disappeared from sailing until 1995, when he built Sayonara,'' Erkelens said of Ellison. ''But the boat's been active since then, and just finished the Chicago-Mackinac Race. He seems to enjoy it more and more with every regatta, which is leading us in this direction.''</p>
        <p>Cayard said he had considered pressing forth with another America One challenge, but had essentially been priced out of the competition.</p>
