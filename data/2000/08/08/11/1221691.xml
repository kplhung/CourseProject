        <p>S.E.C. Approves Regulation To End Selective Disclosure  The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule that would ban companies from giving important information to analysts and professional investors before disclosing it to the public.</p>
        <p>The rule should accelerate the democratization of investing fostered by the Internet. Online trading, financial message boards and the rapid-fire dissemination of news from Web sites have helped close the gap between average investors and Wall Street. Opponents of the regulation say it could lead to an ''information blackout'' if companies grow more cautious about talking. [Page C7.]</p>

        <p>S.E.C. Approves Regulation To End Selective Disclosure  The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule that would ban companies from giving important information to analysts and professional investors before disclosing it to the public.</p>
        <p>The rule should accelerate the democratization of investing fostered by the Internet. Online trading, financial message boards and the rapid-fire dissemination of news from Web sites have helped close the gap between average investors and Wall Street. Opponents of the regulation say it could lead to an ''information blackout'' if companies grow more cautious about talking. [Page C7.]</p>
        <p>U.S. May Clear Verio Acquisition  Clinton administration officials are close to resolving national security concerns and allowing Japan's NTT Communications to purchase the American Internet service provider Verio for $5.5 billion, people involved in the negotiations said. Shares of Verio rallied on hopes that NTT's $60-a-share purchase will proceed after a three-month delay. Verio rose $3.6875, to $57.1875. [C9.]</p>
        <p>Toys 'R' Us and Amazon.com Tie-Up  Toys ''R'' Us and Amazon.com plan to merge their online toy-sales units, an acknowledgment that selling toys on the Internet has been too hard for each of them. Starting later this year, Toysrus.com will direct users to a toy section of Amazon.com. Customers will be able to use their Amazon accounts to buy toys, books, tools and other merchandise in a single order that will be shipped in one box. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Stocks Mixed on Profit Concerns  The Nasdaq market slumped while blue-chip stocks edged up on concern about corporate profits. The Nasdaq composite index fell 93.51 points, or 2.4 percent, to 3,759.99. The Dow Jones industrial average crept up 2.93 points, or 0.03 percent, to 10,908.76. And the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 12.67 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,460.25. [C7.]</p>
        <p>Treasury to Shut Down Tax Shelter  The Treasury Department took another step in its effort to curb the use of tax shelters, acting to shut down a sophisticated new tax-reduction technique that it said was being marketed to corporations and wealthy individuals by some of the big accounting firms.

        <p>A Logo, a Sport, a Name: A Lawsuit  Forget the horses and the wooden mallets. This polo match is taking place in a courtroom, not on a field. Polo Ralph Lauren, the fashion company, is on one side, and the United States Polo Association, the governing body of the sport since 1890, and Jordache are on the other of a trademark dispute. [C19.]</p>
        <p>Pfizer Chief Is Planning to Retire  William C. Steere Jr., 64, the chief executive of Pfizer, will retire at the end of the year and will be replaced by Henry A. McKinnell, 57, left, a 29-year manager of the drug company, who has long been seen as its next top executive. Since Mr. Steere took over in 1992, Pfizer's sales have almost tripled, and over the last five years, its stock price has increased 500 percent. ''It's the perfect time to leave,'' Mr. Steere said. ''I've done my part. We're No. 1. Now Hank has to figure out how to keep us there.'' [C4.]</p>
        <p>Revenue Growth Slows at Dell  Dell Computer reported record revenue and earnings that beat forecasts. But its revenue growth rate slowed for the third consecutive quarter; some analysts questioned Dell's continued ability to lead the industry. [C4.]</p>
