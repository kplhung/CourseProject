        <p>China's unease with the Internet is growing as the country embraces the new medium to modernize its economy yet worries about the Web's spread beyond government control.</p>
        <p>Just this week, the government-sponsored State Research Information Technology Company said it had hired a California company to help set up electronic commerce sites for thousands of government companies. And it claims to own China's first patented Wireless Application Protocol system, which could greatly expand Internet access in a country where cellular telephones vastly outnumber personal computers.</p>

        <p>China's unease with the Internet is growing as the country embraces the new medium to modernize its economy yet worries about the Web's spread beyond government control.</p>
        <p>Just this week, the government-sponsored State Research Information Technology Company said it had hired a California company to help set up electronic commerce sites for thousands of government companies. And it claims to own China's first patented Wireless Application Protocol system, which could greatly expand Internet access in a country where cellular telephones vastly outnumber personal computers.</p>
        <p>But even as the government pushes its own Internet ventures, it is trying to stamp out others that it sees as a potential political threat.</p>
        <p>''Enemy forces at home and abroad are sparing no effort to use this battlefront to infiltrate us,'' said an editorial this week in the Communist Party's national newspaper, The People's Daily.</p>
        <p>The warning followed renewed reports that local governments are establishing Internet surveillance units and tracking down people who use the Web to express political dissent or other nonconformist ideas. The government shut one such Web site, www.xinwenming.com, this week for posting ''counterrevolutionary content,'' a euphemism that often means nothing more than criticism of the government. Police are searching for the Web site's organizers, according to the New York-based Human Rights in China group.</p>
        <p>The government's deep ambivalence toward the Internet, which Beijing fears could be used to unite opposition to the Communist Party, has slowed the medium's development here. And it threatens to distort the new industry in much the way the planned economy distorted other industries in the past, favoring inefficient government-owned ventures over more creative private ones.</p>
        <p>Already, the government's heavy hand has cast a pall over private Web ventures, which are relying on foreign investment to survive.</p>
        <p>Regulations that make much of the foreign investment technically illegal and the inability of Internet companies to list their shares on China's stock market are scaring off venture capitalists who were still pumping money into the sector just a few weeks ago. Many of the tiny Internet companies started in the last year are running out of cash and closing.</p>
        <p>Internet entrepreneurs say government interference has cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars in investment capital that could have helped close the gap with the Internet of the West.</p>
        <p>Had Beijing moved more quickly, the critics say, many Chinese Internet companies could have listed their shares on Nasdaq before that market tumbled in April and the American public's appetite for Internet plays waned.</p>
        <p>Instead, Beijing dithered and by the time it began allowing Chinese companies to list abroad, the moment had passed. The shares of the last two Chinese Internet companies to list on Nasdaq, Netease.com and Sohu.com, are trading at about half of their initial offering prices. Other Chinese Internet stock offerings have been postponed.</p>
        <p>China's state-owned ventures, meanwhile, are failing to generate much excitement among the venture capital community that has watched the Internet develop elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''Many of the government initiatives which don't have a strong involvement with the private sector do face the risk of failure,'' said David Williams, a Hong Kong-based partner at the American venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson.</p>
        <p>Despite its threatening talk and a few widely publicized arrests, Beijing appears to be failing in its efforts to control unauthorized information flows. The government estimates that 17 million people are connected to the Internet, and that number is doubling every six months while numerous Web sites are popping up each day.</p>
        <p>For example, one popular Web site, www.homeway.com, which regularly posts unconfirmed news reports from the Hong Kong press, had reported for weeks that Li Jizhou, vice minister of public security, was in Beijing's Qincheng Prison awaiting trial for taking bribes worth millions of dollars. And the Web site of the Internet advocate Huang Qi, www.6-4tianwang.com, remains up, despite the arrest of Mr. Huang. He is facing charges of subversion after posting information about the 1989 massacre that ended pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.</p>
