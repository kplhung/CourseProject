        <p>I know there are young children who sit still when their hair is being cut. But not my son, Jake. Jake is one of those children who have what the parenting guides might call ''scissor issues.'' He is 5, and we have tried many ways to get him to sit still long enough for a trim.</p>
        <p>When he was little, his baby sitter's sister cut his hair, but only with his baby sitter and a friend standing on either side of him, one with a pacifier, the other with a bottle, ready to plug him lest he notice that the hair falling in front of his eyes was, indeed, his own.</p>

        <p>I know there are young children who sit still when their hair is being cut. But not my son, Jake. Jake is one of those children who have what the parenting guides might call ''scissor issues.'' He is 5, and we have tried many ways to get him to sit still long enough for a trim.</p>
        <p>When he was little, his baby sitter's sister cut his hair, but only with his baby sitter and a friend standing on either side of him, one with a pacifier, the other with a bottle, ready to plug him lest he notice that the hair falling in front of his eyes was, indeed, his own.</p>
        <p>We considered the ''theme park'' haircutting salons, the ones with the videos, balloons and computer games, but then recalled how the noise and whistles did not fool his sister a bit. She wailed. Besides, their dentist uses diverting videos, and you cannot go to the well too many times with the same distraction. In the playground we sighed when we looked at children with even bangs and parts. We were desperate. Then a friend recommended Michael's.</p>
        <p>Michael's, known formally as Michael's Children's Haircutting Salon, has been on Madison Avenue between 90th and 91st Streets since 1910. Elegant it is not. The walls are white laminated plastic flecked with gold. The floor is brown linoleum. The place is decorated with posters of Italian national soccer teams, pictures of Joe Torre, clippings from newspapers that no longer exist, laminated articles about ''John-John'' haircuts and a framed 1961 letter from Allen Funt, thanking the management for allowing him to film a segment of ''Candid Camera'' on the premises. The faded bunny rabbit cutouts are hung with tape that appears to have leached into the walls.</p>
        <p>''Nothing's changed since 1930 here,'' explained Nick Di Sisto, the owner. (The shop is named for its founder, Michael Fiscella of Palermo, Italy.) ''The same chairs, the same cars,'' Mr. Di Sisto said. ''All the barbers have been here for 25 years or better.''</p>
        <p>The cars he spoke of are the ancient red, orange and green toy roadsters in which children sometimes sit while having their hair cut. Jake prefers to climb in and over the cars while he waits for Mr. Di Sisto or his colleagues, Tony Di Maggio and Sal Olintino, to give the quick nod that says that play is over and that it is time to come to the barber chair. Michael's does not take appointments.</p>
        <p>When you first walk into Michael's, you think, ''Ah, the barbershop of my youth.'' I did. I grew up in Brooklyn, and every other Friday my father took my brother and me to a barbershop on Nostrand Avenue that looked a lot like Michael's. Because this was a time when Brylcreem still defined style, I left with a head that looked like a brilliantine helmet. A haircut cost 75 cents, and tonic was free.</p>
        <p>I recall the smell of witch hazel, the haze of cigarette smoke, the barbers in white, short-sleeved coats and, most vividly, the fact that I sat, sometimes with a hand planted on top of my head. But I sat. My mother tells me that Jake is a lot like me as a child, and she does not always say this with a smile.</p>
        <p>Of my resistance to the barber chair, my mother says simply, ''It was a no-choice deal.''</p>
        <p>Adults do get their hair cut at Michael's, even though the shop bills itself as a ''salon'' specializing in children. It's the sort of place where regulars -- this often means parents of the customers -- feel compelled to chat with the barbers and with one another, generally about the forthcoming special occasion that necessitates the haircut. The barbers are expert at crowd control: Michael's is often busy but never feels crammed.</p>
        <p>Not far from Michael's is a children's salon that in its window displays magazine articles mentioning all the famous people whose children love to have their hair cut there. Of course, the children love it: it's a toy store with a barber chair that looks like a jeep. This approach to haircutting is known as bribery. There is a reason bribery is against the law: children who are being bribed recognize that they've got you, that you cannot bear the shame of their public decompensation, that you will do anything, pay any price, to avoid the moment that forces you to say things like, ''I know you must be very angry.''</p>
        <p>Bribery at Michael's is limited to a lollipop -- maybe two if you are very, very good. And, for first-timers, a certificate attesting to the first haircut. Attached is a small plastic bag into which the cut locks go. The cards are blue for boys and pink for girls. As Mr. Di Sisto said, nothing has changed in 70 years, except, of course, the price: a haircut for a boy or girl, including blow-drying, is $25.</p>
        <p>A visit to Michael's is a reminder that ''parenting'' was once accomplished without books and, for that matter, without a verb to describe it. I have learned many lessons at Michael's, the most important of which is that a child who is being bribed is a child who senses your weakness and, like a clever boxer, will exploit it to his advantage. This does not work at Michael's, where children understand that if they cry, no one will accede to their tears.</p>
        <p>So they don't. It is possible at Michael's to hear the sound of scissors opening and closing, interrupted only by the gratuitous but inevitable, ''Daddy's right here.''</p>
        <p>''No. 1, we come from the old country,'' Mr. Di Sisto explained. ''We learned from the old masters. You've got to be patient. You've got to be very fast with your hands. We work while the kids move. We work with moving targets, that's what we call them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Di Sisto has been cutting hair at Michael's since 1963 and says that in all that time he has never seen a child leave without a haircut. Parents have told him that his was the shop of last resort, that their otherwise wonderful children had been rejected by salons that could not work with them. Michael's spurns no child. The barbers are willing to work with the parents, too.</p>
        <p>Mr. Di Sisto says that almost all parents who come into the shop for the first time are frightened. The barbers recognize the look the moment parent and child step into the shop -- ''the hesitation of the parents,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''They say, 'He's going to be very tough,' '' Mr. Di Sisto continued. ''They're going to feel us out. We say, 'Just relax.' ''</p>
        <p>This is easier said than done.</p>
        <p>''They hang around too close to the chair,'' Mr. Di Sisto said. ''They're afraid the child will cry.''</p>
        <p>Then, in the manner of a Zen master, he added, ''Sometimes the child cries.''</p>
        <p>Or screams. Or yells. As Jake does.</p>
        <p>I brought him in for a badly needed cut not long ago. Tony Di Maggio drew the short straw.</p>
        <p>''You be bad boy and you get no lollipop,'' Mr. Di Maggio told him, at which point Jake shoved his chin onto his chest. I cringed. Then I stopped. And in that moment I experienced the epiphany that comes to those who accept the Way of Michael's: this was not my problem. This was Tony Di Maggio's problem,  and he could handle it.</p>
        <p>''You have a choice: you want one lollipop or you want two?'' he asked Jake. Jake, eager to keep his options open, replied that he wanted none. He then listed hard to his left, in the hope that Mr. Di Maggio's scissors might not reach that far.</p>
        <p>''Stay back,'' Mr. Di Maggio said. ''You going to fall down.''</p>
        <p>Jake sort of sat back. I moved away from my perch at the side of the chair. It was important to me that Mr. Di Maggio saw that I could do this.</p>
        <p>''He's O.K.,'' he said of Jake. ''No big deal.'' Jake's resistance slipped as Mr. Di Maggio worked around the back and top of his head. ''Good boy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The rule at Michael's is that no haircut lasts longer than 15 minutes,  Mr. Di Sisto explained. After years of cutting children's hair, he has concluded that children can sit no longer. This requires what business-school graduates call ''multitasking.'' Tony Di Maggio can do a wonderful bird whistle, cut hair, reassure a fretful parent and still a quivering child all at the same time.</p>
        <p>''Hey, you're itching me!'' Jake protested.</p>
        <p>''When you complain, it's bad for me,'' Mr. Di Maggio replied.</p>
        <p>Jake squirmed.</p>
        <p>''You move, I'm not going to finish,'' Mr. Di Maggio admonished.  ''You want to sit here all day long?''</p>
        <p>The scissors flying past his right ear, Jake tucked his head close to his shoulder.</p>
        <p>''You make me feel bad,'' Mr. DiMaggio said. ''You cry and I'm going to cry, too.''</p>
        <p>Neither did. And soon it was done. Jake declined the offer of a lollipop. He appeared to bear Tony Di Maggio no ill will.</p>
        <p>Later, I asked Jake whether there was anything at all he liked about going to Michael's. He assured me that there was not. What, then, I asked, was the worst part?</p>
        <p>''Getting my hair cut.''</p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>''Because it was scary.''</p>
        <p>And why was it scary?</p>
        <p>''The scissors.''</p>
        <p>Jake continued, citing the case of a classmate as evidence of just how frightening scissors can be, even in the right hands: ''Elizabeth's mom is afraid to cut her nails because she's afraid she'll cut her whole finger off. She said so.''</p>
        <p>But there was something more to Jake's thinking about the barber that made Michael's approach so wise. Haircuts, Jake explained, hurt. Just how they hurt he did not say. But they surely did. He knew it.</p>
        <p>Clearly, a voice of reason and firmness was essential here to counter such assumptions. Who better to apply a dose of fatalism -- you got no choice, kid -- than someone who began cutting hair for a living in Sicily when he was 12 years old?</p>
        <p>''In the older generation,'' Mr. Di Maggio said, ''parents were not so afraid as they are today. You had to get a haircut. Today, we have to be more careful.''</p>
        <p>His haircut over, Jake and I walked outside. I suggested we drop by my parents' home. Jake had other plans. I told him we would visit them just the same. He demurred, holding out for a snack. I caved.</p>
        <p>I am trying, Tony. I am trying.</p>
