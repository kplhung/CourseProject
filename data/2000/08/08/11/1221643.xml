        <p>The Bank of Japan's impending decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in 10 years theoretically is a matter of economic judgment based on facts and data. Instead, it has become a contentious political issue, pitting the central bank governor against an alliance of other high-ranking officials.</p>
        <p>The central bank was due to announce the bank's rate policy on Friday after its policy board meeting. But the stated eagerness of the central bank governor, Masaru Hayami, to end the bank's policy of keeping rates at near zero, where they have been for 18 months, has incited widespread disapproval among the country's leading politicians, who are jittery about any policy measure that might cause Japan's economic recovery to stall.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, at a meeting of economic ministers attended by Mr. Hayami, most participants expressed uneasiness over Mr.Hayami's desire to raise rates, Japanese news accounts of the meeting said.</p>
        <p>Other leading politicians including the prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, called any rate increase premature.</p>
        <p>While it is not unusual for politicians to apply pressure to the central bank in Japan, the pressure has become more significant now because Mr. Hayami has repeatedly said interest rates must eventually rise, and his credibility is at risk.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the law governing the Bank of Japan was revised a few years ago to ensure it has a higher level of independence from the government. So the stepped-up effort by politicians to thwart Mr. Hayami's move is proving to be a test case of whether the central bank has the autonomy that the law says it does.</p>
        <p>If the bank's nine-member policy board approved a rate increase, the benchmark overnight loan rate would probably rise from near zero to 0.25 percent, analysts said. That would be the first increase in interest rates since 1990.</p>
        <p>There has been an extensive debate for years over whether the Bank of Japan's low interest rate policy has been helping the economy overcome its worst period of weakness since the end of World War II.</p>
        <p>Keeping the cost of borrowing at near zero is aimed at making it easier for Japan's highly indebted banks and businesses to repay loans and to stimulate new borrowing for economic expansion.</p>
        <p>But many Japanese corporations, particularly those that borrowed heavily during Japan's boom years in the 1980's, remain heavily indebted, and there is fear that a rise in rates could push some into bankruptcy, setting off a chain of other insolvencies and business failures.</p>
        <p>When the Sogo Company, a department store operator little known outside of Japan, collapsed last month under $17 billion in debt, the reverberations rattled Japan's financial markets and helped persuade the Bank of Japan to delay an interest rate increase.</p>
