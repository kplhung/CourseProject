        <p>When conversation turns to dining out in New York City, Manhattan is sometimes the assumption. But there are five boroughs in town, each offering its share of interesting restaurants. Here are a dozen from a long list of inviting possibilities in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. Aesop's Tables  *  [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(718) 720-2005</p>
        <p>1233 Bay Street</p>
        <p>Rosebank, Staten Island</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Aesop's Tables is the kind of charming storefront restaurant that any block in the West Village would be lucky to have, and that any neighborhood in Brooklyn would envy. In the bountiful garden you can see the stars. The contemporary American menu has appetizers like pulled pork with roasted vegetables and Monterey Jack cheese, and Santa Fe grilled chicken breast on a skewer. Main courses include Caribbean bass fillet steamed in a banana leaf and served with French beans and cilantro oil; and honey-ginger seared duck breast with a crispy risotto cake and orange-citrus black tea sauce.</p>

        <p>Aesop's Tables is the kind of charming storefront restaurant that any block in the West Village would be lucky to have, and that any neighborhood in Brooklyn would envy.

        <p>2. Al Di La</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(718) 783-4565</p>
        <p>248 Fifth Avenue,</p>
        <p>at Carroll Street</p>
        <p>Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>$ Visa and Mastercard</p>
        <p>The food at this Venetian-accented neighborhood restaurant is soulful and gutsy, with simple yet profound flavors that make a delicious first impression and reveal their surprising depth bite after bite. While many selections are unpretentious, with humble ingredients like tripe, calf's liver and Swiss chard, pastas are superb, among them casunziei ravioli, beet-stuffed packets that are so delicate they are almost transparent, served in a sauce of butter flavored only with Parmesan and poppy seeds. Main courses like braised rabbit and pork saltimbocca are marvelous.</p>
        <p>3. Diner</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(718) 486-3077</p>
        <p>85 Broadway,</p>
        <p>at Berry Street</p>
        <p>Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>$ Visa and Mastercard</p>
        <p>In revitalizing this old-fashioned diner practically underneath the Williamsburg Bridge, Andrew Tarlow and Mark Firth turned Diner into an up-to-date neighborhood hangout that serves the needs of its surrounding creative community. That means hanger steak, French fries and a martini rather than grilled cheese and a milkshake, in a smoky, happy dining room. The chef, Caroline Fidanza, used to cook at Savoy, and she pays special attention to the quality of the ingredients and to the details, whether it's making a superb hamburger or a perfectly cooked whole trout.</p>
        <p>4. Jimmy's Bronx Cafe</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(718) 329-2000</p>
        <p>281 West Fordham Road,</p>
        <p>at the Major Deegan Expressway</p>
        <p>The Bronx</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Slightly west of the Bronx's Little Italy, Jimmy's, which seats 400, offers a bridge to the area with fried mozzarella, fried calamari and spaghetti. But the emphasis is Latin American. Among the appetizers are empanadas, oysters and clams on the half-shell and a shrimp ceviche. Paella can be all seafood or seafood and meat. Other entrees include lobster, several shrimp dishes and guava barbecued spareribs. Flan, toasted almond cream, lemon mousse cake or pecan pie can round off the meal.</p>
        <p>5. Karyatis</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(718) 204-0666</p>
        <p>35-03 Broadway</p>
        <p>Astoria, Queens</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The extensive menu at this Greek spot offers traditional dishes like octopus and squid with fresh tomatoes, stuffed zucchini and roast leg of lamb. Appetizers include crispy deep-fried cod with garlic sauce, and broiled shrimp with feta cheese. Entrees include baked red snapper with onions, garlic, tomatoes and herbs, or with feta cheese; shrimp sauteed in butter with fresh garlic and herbs; and lamb cooked in an egg-lemon sauce served with seasonal vegetables.</p>
        <p>6. Lucian Blue</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(718) 422-0093</p>
        <p>63 Lafayette Avenue, at Fulton Street</p>
        <p>Fort Greene, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Unlike most Fort Greene restaurants, which have a homespun, Berkeley feel to them, Lucian Blue is sleek and glossy with a busy bar in front. But the dining room is mellow and romantic, an affordable date place. The food, with Southern and Caribbean elements, includes a lively salad of sliced shrimp, greens and mango that is galvanized by a little hot pepper, and main courses like a juicy grilled pork chop with a spicy mustard glaze, served with garlic mashed potatoes and al dente pea pods, and a grilled sirloin with caramelized onions and leeks.</p>
        <p>7. Madiba</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(718) 855-9190</p>
        <p>195 DeKalb Avenue, near Adelphi Street</p>
        <p>Fort Greene, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>$ All major cards.</p>
        <p>This little bar and restaurant, seemingly woven out of straw, old wood and scrap metal, may be New York's only South African restaurant, and it is one of the most intriguing spots in the city. The extensive menu includes unfamiliar dishes like uphuthu, a ground corn porridge not unlike polenta, with marinated tomatoes and onions; and sauteed chicken livers peri-peri, a spicy dish of Portuguese origin, delicious on toast. Durban samoosas, excellent crisp vegetable pastries served with a fine carrot-and-raisin slaw, reflect an Indian influence. The menu offers far more, like various sorts of dried meats, potjie (a kind of oxtail stew) and a small South African wine list.</p>
        <p>8. Malaysian Rasa Sayang</p>
        <p>++</p>
        <p>(718) 424-9054</p>
        <p>75-19 Broadway,</p>
        <p>near Roosevelt Avenue</p>
        <p>Jackson Heights, Queens</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>Malaysian Rasa Sayang is a modest restaurant with a mostly Asian clientele at its handful of tables, awaiting the fresh and fiery blend of Malay, Chinese and Indian cuisines, with dashes of Thai and even Portuguese. Sambal shrimp is a spicy, sublime stir-fry of minced chilies, scallions, galangal and shrimp in a potent shrimp-paste stock. Asam curried fish head, a house specialty, comes to the table in a clay pot bubbling with chunks of moist fish and cubes of deep-fried bean curd swirling in spicy tomato broth fragrant with anise. Asam laksa, another standout, is Malaysia's meal in a bowl, a spicy sweet-sour fish soup with fat round noodles and crunchy strips of cucumber. Milder dishes, just as impressive, include a baby oyster omelet and deep-fried blocks of bean curd with a pink shrimp curled inside.</p>
        <p>9. Manducatis</p>
        <p>++</p>
        <p>(718) 729-4602</p>
        <p>13-27 Jackson Avenue,</p>
        <p>at 47th Avenue</p>
        <p>Long Island City, Queens</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The printed menu doesn't mean much at Manducatis. Regulars simply ask for whatever's cooking in the kitchen, consult briefly with the owner, Vincenzo Cerbone, and eat what his wife, Ida, turns out. There's one dish that always appears midway between the appetizers and the entree (or entrees), and it's a show stopper. A small pile of homemade fettuccine is woven together with meaty slices of sauteed portobello mushrooms and plum tomatoes. The dish, earthy and intensely flavored, is heady with garlic and basil, and a touch of hot red pepper gives it a subtle but unmistakable zing. When it comes to the table and its fragrant cloud rises, it takes a disciplined diner not to throw himself on the plate. ''Manducatis'' is Latin. It means ''you eat.'' You do.</p>
        <p>10. Peter Luger Steakhouse  ***  [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(718) 387-7400</p>
        <p>178 Broadway, near Driggs Avenue</p>
        <p>Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>$$$ Cash only</p>
        <p>If you insist, the waiter will give you a menu, but there's not much to read. For more than a century, people have been flocking to its bare, beer-stained halls to eat a single dish: porterhouse steak, served for two, three or four. The potatoes are usually good, and the spinach is acceptable, but the meat is the main point; it's the best steak in America. That is why the restaurant is packed daily with people who, perhaps out of necessity, have developed affection for the beer hall setting.</p>
        <p>11. Roberto's  *  [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(718) 733-9503</p>
        <p>632 East 186th Street, near Crescent Avenue</p>
        <p>The Bronx</p>
        <p>$ Mastercard and Visa</p>
        <p>In this 54-seat bastion of no-nonsense Neapolitan cooking, bowls of homemade pasta and platters of fried meat are plopped in front of large parties with no apology. Choices to start include grilled portobello mushrooms and zucchini, shrimp with white beans and balsamic vinegar, cured beef with Parmesan and arugula, and pasta and fagioli thick enough to support a spoon. Among the entrees are grilled salmon and shell steak, but the chicken and veal are the reason to go to Roberto's. Chicken scarpariello, the veal with lemon sauce, and the double-cut veal chop will not disappoint. Desserts include a Neapolitan risotto-and-fruit cake, chocolate pignoli tarts and small cream puffs.</p>
        <p>12. Saul</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(718) 935-9844</p>
        <p>140 Smith Street, at Bergen Street</p>
        <p>Boerum Hill, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>$$ Visa and Mastercard</p>
        <p>The food at this sweet little brick storefront is perhaps the most elegant in the neighborhood. It offers strong, clear flavors augmented by garnishes that enhance without overshadowing. Cucumber soup comes with avocado and tomato. Duck confit is rich and deeply flavored, served with German potato salad and roasted figs, while three fat sea scallops arrive on an iridescent pool of parsley vinaigrette, an odd looking but exceptional dish.</p>
