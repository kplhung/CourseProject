        <p>ANTIBALAS, P.S. 1 Contemporary Arts Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. The conceptual beach in this art gallery's courtyard holds disc jockeys and live bands in its Saturday afternoon events.

        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>ANTIBALAS, P.S. 1 Contemporary Arts Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084.

Tomorrow from 3 to 9 p.m.; admission is $5 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>* BUJU BANTON, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. Buju Banton started out as a dance hall toaster, bragging with raspy enthusiasm about girls, guns and macho exploits, including an infamous song about gay-bashing. Then he changed his mind and his music, turning to songs about spirituality and an end to violence. His new album, ''Unchained Spirit,'' worships Jah and roots in reggae, gospel harmony and ska. Sunday at 7:30 p.m.; tickets are $35 to $75 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>CECIL BROOKS 3D AND THE SAVANT/HIGH NOTE ALL STARS, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue, above Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 242-1785. Cecil Brooks is a drummer and a record producer in New York's underground-mainstream scene; he'll be bringing in some seasoned players to make up his band, including the pianist John Hicks and the trumpeter Riley Mullins. Sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11 p.m., with a 12:30 show tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $20, with a $10 minimum (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>RON CARTER QUINTET, STEVE TURRE QUARTET, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. The all-around musical expertise of Mr. Carter, the great bassist, since his days with Miles Davis in the 1960's -- including classical music, among other things -- has freed up the way he presents jazz. Mr. Turre, a trombonist, is from the tail end of the 60's generation, and he has an unconventional streak; his conch-shell band was one of the great curiosities of recent years. Double-feature sets are today through Sunday at 9 and 11:30 p.m.; cover charge is $30, with a $5 minimum. (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* RAVI COLTRANE QUINTET, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. With a slightly mumbling, nearly affectless style, Mr. Coltrane plays original tunes built on small motifs that work their way under your skin. Happily, he sounds nothing like his father, John Coltrane, and when the band is at its peak you never quite know where the music is heading. Sets are tonight at 8 and 10; admission is $12 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>DON DIXON, ROBBIE FULKS, MARTI JONES, STEVE POLTZ, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, at Mercer Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. The latest installment of the ''In Their Own Words'' series, with songwriters sharing the stage, their songs and some stories behind them, is on the cusp of country and folk-rock. Robbie Fulks is fond of both honky-tonk and the Beatles, and he comes up with tuneful, neatly phrased songs about near-psychotic characters. Steve Poltz was a co-writer of Jewel's hit ''You Were Meant for Me.'' Don Dixon and his wife, Marti Jones, put Chapel Hill, N.C., on the indie-rock map with their own songs and with Mr. Dixon's production of R.E.M., Marshall Crenshaw and others.  Tonight at 7:30 and 10:30; admission is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>DIXIE DREGS, STEVE MORSE BAND, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. Look for the calloused fingers of envious guitarists in the audience for this double bill of speed-fingered bands whose jazz-rock fusion doesn't disdain a touch of country. Steve Morse, who has played guitar with Kansas and Deep Purple, was a founding member of the Dregs, and the Dixie Dregs and the Steve Morse Band may well mingle during their sets. Tonight at 9; admission is $30 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>GODSPEED YOU BLACK EMPEROR, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Godspeed You Black Emperor conjures gloom, entropy and dazed contemplation. It uses guitars, bass fiddles, violins and drums to sound like a combination of Pink Floyd circa 1969 with Philip Glass arranged for strings. The group plays revolving patterns of minor-key chords at a tempo just above a standstill, then works up to martial climaxes; every so often, a recorded voice intones something like, ''The skyline was beautiful on fire, all twisted metal stretching upwards.'' Tonight at 9; tickets: $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>GROOVE COLLECTIVE, Wetlands, 161 Hudson Street, at Laight Street, TriBeCa, (212) 386-3600. Brooklyn's long-running acid-jazz band looks back to the smoothly percolating funk-jazz of the 1970's and adds touches of 1990's hip-hop, making easygoing party music for a broad coalition of listeners. Tonight at 10; admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>KRISTIN HERSH, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. Kristin Hersh has been making soul-stirring music that gets to the heart of the mind-body connection since her adolescence. She has chronicled her own life changes -- motherhood, struggles with mental illness, reaching maturity -- in songs that are as individualistic as rock gets yet touch on hidden universals. This solo show focuses on new material. Tomorrow night at 8 with the Willard Grant Conspiracy; Sunday night at 8 with Jennifer O'Connor. Tickets are $14 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>* INSOUND ZINE CONFERENCE WITH TED LEO, IDA AND RETSIN, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. The Webzine, record label and shelter in a storm that links lovers of independent music, cinema and writing across college campuses and bohemian neighborhoods nationwide celebrates self-produced publications on and off the Web. Editors, writers and artists will discuss the future of the photocopied and U.R.L.-based zine at panels, schmooze in the hallway and rock out gently in the evening to three favorites of the underground rock scene: Ted Leo, Ida and Retsin. The conference begins tomorrow at noon, with music at 8 p.m.; admission is $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* ALI AKBAR KHAN, Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center (212) 875-5108. Ali Akbar Khan is a master of the sarod, an Indian lute with a deeper, throatier tone than the sitar. In India, he has been designated a National Living Treasure; his ragas are models of profound delicacy and virtuoso flamboyance. Sunday at 8 p.m.; admission is free, part of Lincoln Center Out of Doors. (Pareles).</p>
        <p>KID ROCK, PNC Bank Arts Center, Garden State Parkway, Exit 117, Holmdel, N.J., (201) 507-8900. The man has charisma. Skinny, badly outfitted in costume-shop gangster clothes, with the facial hair of an underage beer buyer and a vocal style that sounds as if he has just gargled some Scope, Kid Rock nonetheless sets the stage on fire (and gets the ladies screaming) with his crunchy rock-rap. His success is pop democracy in action, and in that way, it's inspirational. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $31.50 and $38 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* FEMI KUTI AND POSITIVE FORCE, LAMB, Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, mid-park at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777. Giant Step, which promotes club events and runs its own label, celebrates its 10th anniversary with a typically diverse group of performers united because they make people dance. Femi Kuti plays a less confrontational version of the Afro-beat invented by his father, Fela Anikulapo Kuti. It's burly Nigerian funk with bruising horn riffs, jazzy solos and lyrics that have serious points to make. Lamb is an English duo -- one gizmo master, one chanteuse -- that finds a lot of flexibility in trip-hop; it can sound like Bjork or Tricky, or it can leave the conventional 4/4 beat behind. Also on the bill are the tap-dance improviser Tamango and the rhythm-and-blues singer Mark Anthony Jones. Sunday at 3 p.m., after disc-jockey sets by Gilles Peterson and Ron Trent beginning at 1:30 p.m. Admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>LA LEY, LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES, ILLYA KURYAKI AND THE VALDERRAMAS, Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, mid-park at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777. As a prelude to the Latin Alternative Music Conference, three rock en espanol bands are on this Summerstage bill. Although La Ley is a painfully earnest band aspiring to be Chile's answer to U2, the other bands on the bill are funnier and more reckless in their willingness to toss together any sounds they like. Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, work through various styles of lounge music and funk, blurring the line between smarm and charm. Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas are a band from Argentina that's in love with American funk, particularly Prince and P-Funk -- not just the rhythms, but the freedom to toss in power chords and surreal verbal digressions over the beat. Tomorrow at 3 p.m.; admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MOTLEY CRUE, MEGADETH, Jones Beach, Meadowbrook Parkway South, Wantagh, Long Island, (516) 221-1000. There was a time when these two band sharing a bill would have been the equivalent of successful Camp David talks. Motley Crue is a party on wheels, its music rough but still basically boppy, and all about girls, girls, girls. Megadeth, fronted by the original Metallica guitarist, Dave Mustaine, was pure thrash-metal, all about the death drive. Thrash metal fans hated hair bands like the Crue. But time -- and the prospect of cash when your band is no longer young -- heals all wounds in rock. What next? Eminem joins Creed? Tonight at 7; tickets are $29 and $39 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* NATHAN AND THE ZYDECO CHA-CHAS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Forget the cha-cha; Nathan Williams and his band have become one of the top draws in the Louisiana bayou by playing supercharged zydeco two-steps and waltzes, revved up by the frenetic scraping of the rubboard (metal washboard) and, sometimes, a hint of ska or funk. Sunday at 8 and 10:30 p.m.; admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* NEW DIRECTIONS, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. This band was convened last year for a special Blue Note Records project: a cross-country tour and an album in which a constellation of young players around the alto saxophonist Greg Osby reinterpreted classic jazz tunes from the Blue Note catalog. But a supergroup, with all the irrelevance and arid chest-thumping that word conveys, this is not; nor is it just playing the hits (by Horace Silver, Lou Donaldson, Wayne Shorter, etc.). It includes the band members' originals, too. It's basically Greg Osby's well-practiced, supremely stretchable quartet with the young, smoky-toned tenor saxophonist Mark Shim along for the ride. (The vibraphonist Stefon Harris, part of the original band, isn't with the group this week.) And Mr. Osby's band, if you haven't seen it live, is just about the most exciting in the jazz business right now, making music change shape and rhythm in seamless and often brilliant sets. Don't miss it. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., with a 1 a.m. set tomorrow night; cover charge is $20, $15 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>NOVEMBER PROJECT, DARDEN SMITH, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. October Project was a smooth pop band with high ambitions that lost its major-label deal a while ago. November Project features the same writing team, Julie Flanders and Emil Adler, and a new singer, 20-year-old Mary Anne Marino. Darden Smith is a veteran Texas singer and songwriter who has honed his craft in Nashville and New York. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; tickets are $20 (Powers).</p>
        <p>ONE FOR ALL, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. It's a cooperative group of young New York mainstream-jazz players, all of them busy in other bands. Eric Alexander, the band's tenor player, who has a warm, sure tone, seems to show up on a few dozen records a year. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $25 cover ($18 for midnight sets) and a $10 minimum; Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with an $18 cover and $10 minimum. (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>THE PERSUASIONS, BUCKWHEAT ZYDECO, Celebrate Brooklyn!, Prospect Park Band Shell, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, (718) 855-7882, extension 45. The Persuasions have been honing their unaccompanied harmonies for 37 years, balancing husky chords and hortatory gospel-style leads atop the subterranean bass notes of Jimmy Hayes. They used to rely on 1950's oldies, but they have moved their timeline into the psychedelic 1960's; their most recent album is a collection of Frank Zappa songs, and the next one is a Grateful Dead collection. Stanley (Buckwheat) Dural Jr. is a zydeco accordionist rockers can love. He bolsters the hefty sound of his accordion with a horn section, and his sets include plenty of gutsy blues tunes along with Cajun two-steps and waltzes. The band is an indefatigable party generator. Tonight at 7:30; admission is free, with a $3 donation requested (Pareles).</p>
        <p>JIMMY SCOTT, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. The singer of slow, sepulchral standards keeps rolling along, with the cracks and crevices in his voice seeming either more authentic or more disturbing, depending on your point of view. Either way, he can dislodge an emotional response as few other jazz vocalists can. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $25, with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>SUPER BLUE, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Super Blue has won both Road March and Soca Monarch titles at Trinidad's carnivals, with songs that slip some serious ideas into danceable soca tunes. Tonight at midnight and 2 a.m.; admission is $22 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>CARLOS VIVES, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171. Carlos Vives was a Colombian actor until he took a role as a musician and decided to start performing la musica vallenata, a rural accordion-driven style that is Colombia's answer to zydeco. He has been creating pop and rock hybrids, but the accordion is never far away, Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $43 to $68 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* RANDY WESTON'S AFRICAN RHYTHMS, Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. It's not easy to achieve an individual sound on the piano, but Mr. Weston has one. With echoes of Ellington and Monk, it's deep and ringing, and he hangs out for stretches at the extreme ends of the piano. Sets through Sunday night are at 8:45 and 10:45, with a 12:15 set tonight and tomorrow night. Cover charge is $25 tonight and tomorrow night, $20 Sunday night; all shows have a $10 minimum. (Ratliff).</p>
