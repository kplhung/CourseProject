        <p>There has been a good deal of talk from the Gore campaign and pundits questioning the seriousness of Gov. George W. Bush's desire to reach out to minority and poor communities. Some have suggested that this effort is newfound, an act or a false religion. But I know Mr. Bush is sincere about the Republican Party becoming more inclusive of minorities, because just over a decade ago, when I was a junior staff member on his father's campaign staff, he talked to me at length about that very same commitment.</p>

        <p>There has been a good deal of talk from the Gore campaign and pundits questioning the seriousness of Gov. George W. Bush's desire to reach out to minority and poor communities. Some have suggested that this effort is newfound, an act or a false religion. But I know Mr. Bush is sincere about the Republican Party becoming more inclusive of minorities, because just over a decade ago, when I was a junior staff member on his father's campaign staff, he talked to me at length about that very same commitment.</p>
        <p>Back in 1987 and 1988, I worked on the presidential campaign of then Vice President Bush, helping to write speeches and doing research for his campaign manager, Lee Atwater, and his deputy, Ed Rogers. I was a minor league player in big-time politics. But because I worked with Mr. Atwater and Mr. Rogers, I had a certain access that most did not. During the campaign, they had offices next to each other, and George W. Bush, who was helping his father's campaign, had an office across the hall. When Mr. Bush was not working at campaign headquarters in Washington, Lee and Ed would sometimes park me in his office.</p>
        <p>On more than one occasion Mr. Bush walked in and found me sitting at his desk. The first time this happened, I jumped up and apologized.  He told me to sit down in his chair while he sat in a guest chair in front of the desk.</p>
        <p>During our several conversations, he asked about my background and how I had come to work on his dad's campaign. I told him that I was far from a stereotypical Republican. I told him that I had grown up on welfare, that my family had been homeless a number of times, and that  I had spent much of my childhood in inner cities, where I was often the only white kid in class.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush almost immediately began asking me if I thought the G.O.P. was doing enough to reach out to black and Hispanic voters. I told him it was not. He then proceeded to tell me why the party had to do more, that it is was not rocket science to get it done and that for the party to grow and survive, we had to reach out.</p>
        <p>What struck me most about those  conversations more than 12 years ago was that Mr. Bush was not trying to spin or impress anyone, because there was no one to impress. There were no cameras, no reporters, no senior staff members -- no one. It was just he and I, a junior campaign nobody, sitting in his office talking about the need for the Republican Party to snap out of it and start talking to minority voters. He was sincere, he was animated, and he was a bit angry at his party.</p>
        <p>Today, as I think about our conversations, I still think that we Republicans have a lot of work to do to convince some in the G.O.P. that Americans of color enrich our party and make it stronger. The one person I know we don't have to convince is our nominee.</p>
