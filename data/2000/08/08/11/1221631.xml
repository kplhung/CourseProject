        <p>First came a grenade, going off near a bank and luring the police and journalists to inspect the damage. Then, 15 minutes later, a car bomb exploded within feet of the crowd, killing at least 10 people today in Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital.</p>
        <p>The militant group Hizbul Mujahedeen claimed responsibility for the brutally choreographed incident. For the group, it was a sensational return to the practice of killing, its first major strike since calling off a cease-fire two days ago.</p>
        <p>Hopes for peace in Kashmir were a fancy that passed in a mere two weeks, and now disputed Kashmir seems back to the bloody attacks and counterattacks that have taken 25,000 to 40,000 lives since 1989.</p>
        <p>Among the dead were eight police officers and a photographer, Pradeep Bhatia, who worked for the Indian daily Hindustan Times.</p>
        <p>Mohammad Amin War, a photographer wounded by the blast, told The Associated Press that Mr. Bhatia had been standing in front of him. ''He fell down, and I could see pieces of car flying over us,'' he said. ''He was bleeding. So was I.''</p>
        <p>Salim Hashmi, a spokesman for Hizbul Mujahedeen in Islamabad, said the attack was an act of frustration, caused by India's unwillingness to meet his group's main condition for peace talks: that Pakistan be included at the table.</p>
        <p>''With our cease-fire we showed the Indians that we can be peace-loving, but with this we have now shown them that we can also be strong fighters,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Hizbul's cease-fire, declared in a surprise announcement on July 24, was at first said to be an unconditional gesture that would last three months. Only later, as other mujahedeen groups criticized the move, did Hizbul's leaders begin making demands.</p>
        <p>In a statement sent by fax to the Reuters news agency in Islamabad, Hizbul warned that bigger military operations would follow if India persisted with its ''traditional intransigence.''</p>
        <p>The bombing today was reminiscent of a similar attack in Srinagar five years ago, when 13 people were killed near the same branch of the State Bank of India.</p>
        <p>This time, a hand grenade was thrown toward the heavily guarded bank, where security personnel pick up their wages. Policemen and journalists rushed over to look through the debris, unaware that a bomb had been planted beneath a white Ambassador, one of the most common automobiles in this country. The blast was powerful enough to destroy several cars and tear out the windows of nearby buildings.</p>
        <p>Kashmir is claimed by both India and Pakistan. It has been the source of two of the three wars between them since the two nations gained independence in 1947. For the last 11 years, there has been a rebellion in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, with indigenous forces abetted by Pakistan-backed warriors who see the struggle as a quest in the name of Islam.</p>
