        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's top aides are deeply divided over the selection of his next police commissioner, with one camp arguing that the job should go to a popular insider, while others say that he should choose an outsider who will shake up the police force even at this late date in the mayor's tenure.</p>
        <p>The split is so wide that the administration late yesterday gave off signs that it was flailing about, with key advisers throwing out new or even unlikely names as replacements for Commissioner Howard Safir, including former Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, who was forced out when Mr. Giuliani was first elected.</p>
        <p>But several city officials indicated yesterday afternoon that Joseph P. Dunne, the  chief of department, and Bernard B. Kerik, the commissioner of the city's Department of Correction, were still considered the most likely choices.</p>
        <p>Dennison Young Jr., the mayor's counsel, and Steven M. Fishner, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator, were said to be backing Mr. Dunne. The mayor's chief of staff, Anthony V. Carbonetti, and the deputy mayor for operations, Joseph J. Lhota, were urging the mayor to name Mr. Kerik as the city's top law enforcement officer, officials said.  Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington was said to be on the fence between the candidates.</p>
        <p>''I am glad I am not in the mayor's shoes,'' said Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island borough president, who has consulted with Mr. Giuliani's advisers about the search. ''It is a tough choice. But Rudy likes that. He invites different opinions so he can evaluate different sides.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the pick, it will clarify just what Mr. Giuliani's goals are for his remaining 16 months in office and how broad -- or limited -- his ambitions are as the energetic mayor enters what could be a more static, lame-duck period. Mr. Giuliani has indicated this week that he has no intention of curtailing his ambitions, even as his term comes to a close. But he offered little clarity himself yesterday on his deliberations, declining even to say how quickly he plans to make up his mind. ''I never put time frames on important decisions,'' he said during his daily news conference.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Dunne and Mr. Kerik are considered strong candidates, even by those who are not advocating one over the other. Both men declined to comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunne, 52, was commander in the 1990's of some of the city's toughest precincts, and he pushed his officers to move aggressively to cut crime. At the same time, he was known to visit black churches on Sunday mornings. That gives him an advantage if the mayor wants to put emphasis on an effort to ease tension between his administration and minority communities, tension that has escalated following a series of shootings of unarmed black men.</p>
        <p>Given the major decline in crime that has occurred in the first six and half years of the Giuliani administration, some of the mayor's advisers were saying he should take the chance to address this weak spot.</p>
        <p>''You need a commissioner who can go out to diverse communities and win their support, explain this is why we are doing this, it is good for you, for your children and your grandchildren,'' said one top mayoral aide.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kerik, 44, a former city police officer who grew up in northern New Jersey, is more likely to try to increase accountability within the department, having proved in his two and a half years of running the Correction Department that he has little patience for managers who do not produce results. Mr. Kerik has radically changed the climate inside the city's notoriously chaotic and brutal jails, reducing slashings and stabbings among inmates.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Safir's perceived weaknesses, according to some top city officials, was his inability to control department spending, particularly overtime costs, something Mr. Kerik has succeeded in doing at the Correction Department, even while improving performance.</p>
        <p>What complicates the matter, several officials said, is that the attributes some Giuliani aides consider the candidates' strengths, others point to as weaknesses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunne is a Brooklyn native whose 31 years on the force give him intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the department and the personalities within the department. That would enable him to quickly assume control of the nation's largest police force, his backers within the administration said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giuliani may be reluctant to name a commissioner with alliances so tied to the department. The mayor has never been shy about his interest in helping to run the department, and he wants an administrator whose allegiance is ultimately to him. Mr. Dunne, therefore, is seen by some to be too much of a police department ''soldier,'' one city official said.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Kerik's case, some wonder if a police department that has proved so effective in reducing crime really needs widespread reform. Some also point out that Mr. Kerik never rose very high within the department, leaving in 1994 at the rank of detective after eight years on the force, and that he does not have a college degree. Skeptics say it would take him at least six months to figure out what changes need to be made, leaving him with little time to accomplish much.</p>
        <p>''The next police commissioner does not need to go in there and try to turn the department around,'' one Giuliani aide said.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, neither Mr. Kerik nor Mr. Dunne offers the mayor the same set of attributes he had in Mr. Safir, a close friend, adviser and confidant of 25 years -- and a man the mayor knew would not upstage him.</p>
        <p>That may be why some advisers  said yesterday that the mayor was also contemplating selecting Mr. Young, his longtime counsel. Few members of the Giuliani administration have had a more low-key, behind-the-scenes role, an approach that would seem incompatible with such a high-profile job as police commissioner, making the choice unlikely. The final name floated yesterday by administration officials is that of Kevin P. Farrell, a former police officer who has been sanitation commissioner since March 1999.</p>
        <p>''This is not a situation in which I am worried about finding a talented person,'' the mayor said during an interview on WCBS radio. ''My major concern is making the right choice as among the people that are very, very talented and are good friends of mine.''</p>
