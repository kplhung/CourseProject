        <p>A California congresswoman who is an ally of Vice President Al Gore announced today that she was going ahead with plans to hold a fund-raiser on Tuesday at the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles, despite pleas from Mr. Gore's campaign and Democratic leaders to move the event.</p>
        <p>Democratic Party officials responded quickly, yanking the congresswoman, Representative Loretta Sanchez, from the coveted speaking slot she had at the national convention next week.</p>
        <p>''We have done everything we can, and now we have no alternative but to take action,'' said Joe Andrew, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sanchez said Mr. Gore's staff had encouraged her to switch sites, but after consulting with the board of directors of her political action committee she decided today to keep her 600 invited guests and donors at the mansion. Playboy executives and Ms. Sanchez's aides say the event will be sedate.</p>
        <p>The $5,000-a-plate fund-raiser, which will coincide with the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, has angered Roman Catholic groups as well as some Hispanic organizations.</p>
        <p>''We selected a high-profile venue to highlight the important work of Hispanic Unity U.S.A.,'' Ms. Sanchez said today, referring to her political action committee, which helps register Latino voters. ''The event is sold out, and it will be a great success.''</p>
        <p>Aghast at the image that the fund-raiser at Hugh Hefner's house would project, no matter how stodgy the actual party, Mr. Gore's campaign and Democratic leaders have tried for weeks to persuade Ms. Sanchez to move the event.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who has accepted $1,500 for his campaign this year from Mr. Hefner and his daughter, Christie, voiced his displeasure early, and this week party leaders stepped up the pressure by threatening to cancel her speaking slot at the convention, which they did today.</p>
        <p>Democratic officials said they might also push to remove her as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, a position for which she had been picked by Mr. Gore, and that he might withdraw his  support for her re-election.</p>
        <p>In a letter sent to Ms. Sanchez today, Mr. Andrew wrote: ''As a father of young children, I tried to convey to you my dismay at the kind of message that this event would send. I told you how Democratic state chairs, Latinos, leaders of women's groups and just plain Democrats have called and told me that this event was neither appropriate nor reflective of our party's values. But you refused to budge.''</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's press secretary, said Mr. Gore had made it clear that he disapproved.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore is not participating, supporting, condoning or giving his imprimatur in any shape, way or form to this event,'' Mr. Lehane said. ''We've conveyed our thoughts in every way we can. Obviously, we're reaching the end of the line.''</p>
        <p>Republicans today offered their own thoughts on the Playboy mansion fund-raiser, pointing out that Democrats have accepted more than $104,000 in contributions since 1992 from the Hefners.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore's campaign team suggests they're embarrassed by the idea of having a Democrat fund-raising event held at the Playboy mansion,'' said Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. ''They may not like talking about it, but they sure do enjoy that Playboy money.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gore, the quandary comes at a most inopportune time. Just this week, he selected Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running mate, a reserved Orthodox Jew who publicly excoriated President Clinton for his affair with a White House aide.</p>
