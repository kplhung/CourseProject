        <p>When the executive committee of the National Collegiate Athletic Association meets in Indianapolis today, it will consider a request to move three of its basketball championships from Atlanta because Georgia uses the Confederate battle symbol as part of its state flag.</p>
        <p>The request, made by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, calls for the N.C.A.A. to change the site of the men's Final Four in 2002 and 2007 and the women's Final Four in 2003. The request was made in a letter from Martin Luther King III, the president and chief executive officer of the S.C.L.C., to Cedric Dempsey, the president of the N.C.A.A.</p>

        <p>When the executive committee of the National Collegiate Athletic Association meets in Indianapolis today, it will consider a request to move three of its basketball championships from Atlanta because Georgia uses the Confederate battle symbol as part of its state flag.</p>
        <p>The request, made by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, calls for the N.C.A.A. to change the site of the men's Final Four in 2002 and 2007 and the women's Final Four in 2003. The request was made in a letter from Martin Luther King III, the president and chief executive officer of the S.C.L.C., to Cedric Dempsey, the president of the N.C.A.A.</p>
        <p>Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia said in a statement yesterday that the matter ''is a difficult issue about which discussions are ongoing.'' He said removing the Final Four events from Georgia would be unproductive and that ''actions like this do nothing but inflame and excite emotions.''</p>
        <p>In his letter, which was sent to Dempsey on Tuesday, King said that the S.C.L.C. has requested that the flag be changed by March 31, 2001. Only the Georgia legislature can authorize a change in the design of the flag, a spokesman for the governor said. The legislature does not meet again until January.</p>
        <p>In his letter to Dempsey, King said the Confederate flag ''symbolizes brutality, death to people of color and racism.''</p>
        <p>Wallace Renfro, a spokesman for the N.C.A.A., said yesterday that ''the whole issue of the Confederate flag will be on the agenda for the executive committee'' today.</p>
        <p>The 20-member committee will issue a statement after the meeting, Renfro said, although sudden and dramatic action is not anticipated. ''I'm not going to speculate on what is going to happen,'' Renfro said.</p>
        <p>The men's N.C.A.A. Final Four was last held in Atlanta in 1977.</p>
        <p>The N.C.A.A. has also been considering South Carolina's use of the Confederate battle flag, which was recently removed from the Statehouse, only to be replaced by a smaller version next to a monument for rebel soldiers on the Capitol grounds. Many civil rights organizations have maintained their call for a boycott of the state, but some early rounds of the men's 2002 basketball tournament are scheduled to be played in Greenville, S.C.</p>
