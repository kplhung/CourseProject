        <p>While the Miami Heat works on completing a deal to acquire Brian Grant, the Knicks -- spurned in their efforts to land Grant -- turned their attention once again to Danny Fortson.</p>
        <p>A person in the N.B.A. familiar with the situation said the Knicks renewed talks with the Boston Celtics yesterday in an effort to reach a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Fortson, a 6-foot-7-inch power forward. Fortson, who was courted by the Knicks last week in a visit to the team's practice site in Purchase, N.Y., has already turned down the Knicks' offer of the $2.25 million salary cap exception.</p>

        <p>While the Miami Heat works on completing a deal to acquire Brian Grant, the Knicks -- spurned in their efforts to land Grant -- turned their attention once again to Danny Fortson.</p>
        <p>A person in the N.B.A. familiar with the situation said the Knicks renewed talks with the Boston Celtics yesterday in an effort to reach a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Fortson, a 6-foot-7-inch power forward. Fortson, who was courted by the Knicks last week in a visit to the team's practice site in Purchase, N.Y., has already turned down the Knicks' offer of the $2.25 million salary cap exception.</p>
        <p>Because they are over the salary cap, the only other way for the Knicks to obtain Fortson would be in a sign-and-trade, but they are not alone in their efforts to land the burly forward, who is a force on the offensive boards, where the Knicks are sorely in need of help.</p>
        <p>While the Knicks and the Golden State Warriors have been the most active teams pursuing Fortson, the deal has been difficult to consummate because he is seeking a contract in the range of $4 million a season.</p>
