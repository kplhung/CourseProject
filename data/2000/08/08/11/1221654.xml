        <p>The Treasury Department took another step today in its long-running effort to curb the use of tax shelters, acting to shut down a sophisticated new tax-reduction technique that it said was being marketed to corporations and wealthy individuals by some of the big accounting firms.</p>
        <p>The technique, similar to another that was banned by the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service in December, was used to generate artificial tax losses through investments in partnerships, Treasury officials said.</p>
        <p>They said they had information suggesting that the shelter was being offered to clients of at least one or two of the Big Five accounting firms, although they said they were not sure which ones and declined to single out any of them. They said they had no information about how much revenue the government might have been losing in the form of foregone tax revenues.</p>
        <p>To clamp down on the shelter, Treasury officials said the I.R.S. would formally adopt a position that any tax losses generated by the technique were artificial and would be disallowed. The action can be taken administratively, and does not require legislation or other Congressional approval.</p>
        <p>Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury secretary, said the action again highlighted the need for broad legislation to crack down on tax-avoidance efforts, which have grown in use as accounting firms and tax lawyers comb through the tax code looking for wrinkles that can be exploited to reduce tax liabilities.</p>
        <p>''Closing tax shelters is an essential element of tax fairness, and to minimize the tax burden on American families,'' Mr. Summers said in a conference call with reporters. ''This particular shelter points up the need for more comprehensive approaches so we are in a position to act preventively rather than, as in this case, after the fact.''</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has been pressing Congress for several years to pass legislation to curb tax shelters. But Republicans in Congress have balked, saying they are concerned that any such wide-ranging legislation might inhibit legitimate tax transactions in the name of stopping questionable practices.</p>
        <p>Treasury officials said that in the last few years they had wiped out tax shelters that would have reduced tax revenues by as much as $60 billion over the next 10 years. The federal government expects to take in about $2 trillion in tax revenues this year.</p>
        <p>Providing sophisticated tax reduction advice to clients has become a big business for accounting firms and lawyers. But it has also provoked some unease among tax professionals, some of whom say they are concerned that the techniques they are promoting in some cases go over the line from legitimate tax-minimization efforts to illegal tax-avoidance schemes.</p>
        <p>The transaction the Treasury described today is based on a similar technique known as a bond and options sales strategy, or BOSS, which was barred by the I.R.S. in December. The new variant, dubbed ''son of BOSS'' by Treasury officials, appears to have been developed by accountants just this year, they said. A senior Treasury official said the government learned of the technique through a tip provided to the I.R.S.</p>
        <p>The technique is built around differences in the ways that investment partnerships account for the values of their assets and liabilities.</p>
        <p>In an example provided by a Treasury official, a taxpayer could place into a partnership an asset and a liability that on their face are of equal value. But the liability -- for example, a call option to buy an asset at a specific price -- could be structured in such a way that its value for tax purposes is considerably less than the asset, giving the partnership an artificially high value.</p>
        <p>The partnership could then be sold for a nominal amount, generating a paper loss that could be used to offset income from other transactions.</p>
