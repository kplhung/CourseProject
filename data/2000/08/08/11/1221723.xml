        <p>The Battle of the Brokers has begun.</p>
        <p>In one corner is the group of real estate agents led by the Corcoran Group and Douglas Elliman, the two largest Manhattan residential firms, which said last week that it would set up a multiple listing system for Manhattan properties. Under the system, as many brokers as possible would share their listings, just as agents do in the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>Squaring off against them is a new group of Manhattan real estate companies, which, angry and distrustful of the Corcoran-Elliman alliance, vowed yesterday to set up its own listing service and its own World Wide Web site.</p>
        <p>The trophy is the $8 billion worth of co-ops, condos and houses sold annually in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Real estate agencies in Manhattan have been struggling with the idea of a citywide listing service for years. Because the city lacks one, some brokers say, chaos has reigned. And would-be buyers sometimes do not get to see the co-op or condo they would like to see, because the broker who holds the listing sometimes does not want to share it. (Sharing, called co-brokering, means brokers must split the commission.)</p>
        <p>''Every firm had its own rules about how to co-broke, what to co-broke and when to co-broke,'' said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate.</p>
        <p>Other brokers say the current system, though cumbersome, has not inconvenienced the consumer as much as it has the broker. In any case, most brokerage companies backed a computerized listing service -- the precursor to a multiple listing service -- that was announced in March 1999. But that system started very slowly, said brokers, who still complain about its problems.</p>
        <p>A centralized data base is increasingly important, brokers say, because a good chunk of that data base could then be made available to the public over the Internet. And the Corcoran-Elliman group says that its Web site will be ready by the end of 2000.</p>
        <p>The newer group, which calls itself the MLS Joint Industry Task Force, includes Sotheby's International Realty, Brown Harris Stevens and William B. May Real Estate. It hopes to have its Web site operating by the first quarter of 2001. Like the Corcoran site, it will have sales and rentals available.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the fight over the listings is also a fight over how any joint Internet site for New York real estate would be set up, and who would control it. Both sides say they do not envision a site made up of elitist tiers of premiere properties. Instead, they say, the public will be able to view all the properties available, without any sensitive information like exact address and owners' names. Both sides say the details are still being worked out.</p>
        <p>Despite the lack of details, the fight already shows signs of being a nasty one.</p>
        <p>In the draft of a press release to be released today, JoAnne Kennedy, president of Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy -- one of 45 companies that have joined the newer group -- labeled the Corcoran-Elliman venture ''exclusionary and divisive'' and said the Corcoran-Elliman listing service ''will be operated as a for-profit venture for their two firms.''</p>
        <p>Pamela Liebman, chief executive officer at Corcoran, denied that.</p>
        <p>Using an occasional salty epithet, Ms. Liebman said that Brown Harris Stevens ''is furious they didn't start this, and is maneuvering behind the scenes.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Liebman said the Corcoran-Elliman listings system was similar to the newer group's and would be run co-operatively, with the biggest firms getting the biggest role in the setup. She said that the fees had not been set.</p>
        <p>William L. Zeckendorf, a partner in Brown Harris, angrily called Ms. Liebman's theory about his company's being the ringleader ''preposterous.''</p>
        <p>''People were so incensed; the concept of an M.L.S. and joint Web site had been discussed at the Real Estate Board for years,'' he said. The Corcoran-Elliman group jumped the gun, ''and approximately two weeks ago formed a venture outside the Real Estate Board.'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Liebman said four companies had committed to list with the Corcoran-Elliman system. She said those four firms, including the Halstead Property Company and Bellmarc Realty, controlled 67 percent of the city's exclusive listings. She disputed earlier news accounts that 30 companies had already signed up to their listings system.</p>
        <p>''There couldn't be 30 firms signed up because there's nothing to sign up to yet,'' Ms. Liebman said. The group's charter, she said, is still at the lawyer's office.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem may have been the speed with which the Corcoran-Elliman group sent out its news release about the new system, without consulting with the city's other important firms.</p>
        <p>''If we could fall on our swords about not being communicative, we would,'' said Paul Purcell, of Douglas Elliman. ''Short of apologizing, short of a public flogging,'' he added.</p>
        <p>To Deborah B. Beck, the executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the two warring sides are like two families involved in planning a wedding.</p>
        <p>''There will be an M.L.S. and there will be some kind of joint Internet site,'' she said. ''What we have here is an internal family misunderstanding. It has to be sorted out and it will be.''</p>
        <p>''Everybody's well intentioned,'' she said. ''They're just mad at each other.''</p>
