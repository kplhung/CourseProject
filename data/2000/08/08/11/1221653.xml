        <p>The Dell Computer Corporation reported record revenues and earnings yesterday, beating analysts' estimates for its second fiscal quarter by a penny. But the company's revenue growth rate slowed for the third consecutive quarter, and some analysts questioned its continued ability to lead the industry.</p>
        <p>For the quarter ended July 28, Dell reported earnings of $603 million, or 22 cents a diluted share, up 19 percent from $507 million, or 19 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 25 percent, to $7.67 billion from $6.14 billion, in the quarter.</p>
        <p>Analysts had expected Dell to earn 21 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>Dell shares fell 6.25 cents yesterday to close at $41.75, 30 percent below its 52-week high of $59.6875.</p>
        <p>Ashok Kumar, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, lowered his rating for Dell stock to buy last week from strong buy, citing concerns about slowing sales growth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kumar said yesterday that Dell remains too dependent on sales of desktop PC's and basic servers. ''I expect revenues to come under increasing pressure until the company develops a meaningful storage and services strategy,'' he said. ''Compared to the competition, Gateway continues to extend its consumer penetration while a reviving Compaq along with I.B.M., H.P. and Sun continue to dominate the enterprise, all with sizable storage and services businesses,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Jim Vanderslice, Dell's vice chairman, said in a telephone interview that analysts' concerns were overstated. ''We had a record quarter,'' he said. ''We grew at twice the combined rate of our 10 largest competitors. I think what the industry is worried about is are we going to make our 30 percent year-over-year growth projection,'' he said, adding, ''I would say we're on track to do that.''</p>
        <p>And Michael Dell, the company's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement, ''There remains tremendous room for expansion in all product categories, customer groups and regional markets, and the fundamental advantages of our direct model are more compelling than ever.''</p>
        <p>Dell has long benefited from a business model in which it builds each computer to order, and sells the finished machines directly to customers. The model allows Dell to keep inventory costs far below the costs of its competitors, and to incorporate new components in its designs more rapidly, which tends to keep average selling prices higher. But competitors like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Compaq have narrowed the gap, and can all say they offer broader lines for corporate customers.</p>
        <p>Dell said unit sales growth in the second quarter was 22 percent over all, and faster in enterprise servers, storage products and notebook computers, which it considers strategically important categories. Revenue through www.dell.com represented about 50 percent of total sales and averaged more than $50 million a day by the end of the quarter, up from $30 million in the prior year.</p>
