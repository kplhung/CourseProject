        <p>The Clinton administration today proposed new rules to protect environmentally sensitive wetlands from development, a response to what administration officials called a recent rash of destruction.</p>
        <p>The officials said that in the last two years, some 20,000 acres of wetlands and an additional 150 miles of streams had been destroyed because of what they portrayed as a loophole opened by a court decision three years ago.</p>
        <p>The new rules, to take effect after a 60-day period of public comment, would close that loophole by adding greater detail to regulations that specify what kinds of wetlands development require an environmental impact review by the government.</p>
        <p>The rules, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, are part of the administration's effort to fight the court decision, issued in January 1997 by a federal district judge in Washington and upheld in June 1998 by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>
        <p>Interpreting unspecific language in the Clean Water Act, both courts held that developers did not need to obtain a federal permit to excavate, drain or ditch a wetland as long as they did not dump soil on the property in question. The E.P.A. had sought as early 1993 to subject all development on wetlands to strict environmental review, but that approach was rejected by the courts,  which ruled in favor of arguments made by developers and by the National Mining Association.</p>
        <p>Among the winners in that case was the National Association of Homebuilders, which today expressed strong disagreement with the new rules. ''This is a bad decision,'' said a spokeswoman, Susan Asmus, ''and it is not consistent with the previous court rulings or with the Clean Water Act.''</p>
        <p>In her own announcement, Carol M. Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said: ''Today's proposal will allow us to go as far as we can through administrative reforms to close this loophole and protect wetlands. The action we take today strengthens the protection of vital resources for future generations.''</p>
        <p>Similarly the Sierra Club hailed the decision as an important strengthening of environmental safeguards. ''Limiting this loophole should protect the streams and wetlands that are home to thousands of birds, fish and other wildlife,'' said Robin Mann of the club's National Wetlands Committee. ''Streams and marshes protect our communities by acting as a natural sponge, soaking up water that would otherwise flood our neighborhoods.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials warned that the action would not in itself be sufficient to guard against destruction of wetlands, and called on Congress to strengthen the Clean Water Act further.</p>
        <p>The term ''wetlands'' is generally used to describe marshes, swamps, bogs and similar areas typically situated between dry land and bodies of water. These areas play important roles in filtering and cleansing water, in serving as a reservoir for flood water, and in harboring fish and shellfish populations.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A.'s announcement today  vividly described the areas' significance. ''Destruction of wetlands,'' the statement said, ''can increase flooding and runoff potential, harm neighboring property, cause stream and river pollution and result in the loss of valuable habitat.''</p>
        <p>Since the late 1700's, the agency said, over half the nation's wetlands have been lost to development and other activities. Seven states, it said,  have lost more than 80 percent of their original wetlands.</p>
