        <p>Aetna U.S. Healthcare will change its payment system for all its primary care doctors in Connecticut in an effort to improve relations with physicians in Connecticut, Aetna officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Aetna announced in May that for physicians with 100 or fewer Aetna clients, it would abandon the current program, which pays primary care physicians a fixed amount per patient each month, regardless of the time spent with a patient. The original announcement would have affected about 70 percent of Aetna's 1,800 network doctors in Connecticut.</p>

        <p>Aetna U.S. Healthcare will change its payment system for all its primary care doctors in Connecticut in an effort to improve relations with physicians in Connecticut, Aetna officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Aetna announced in May that for physicians with 100 or fewer Aetna clients, it would abandon the current program, which pays primary care physicians a fixed amount per patient each month, regardless of the time spent with a patient. The original announcement would have affected about 70 percent of Aetna's 1,800 network doctors in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>But Aetna decided to pay all doctors on a fee-for-service basis to simplify administration for physicians and Aetna, said Dr. Gordon W. Grundy, network medical director for Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Dr. Grundy said the change would not affect patients, but would help the insurer recruit new doctors.</p>
        <p>Aetna will also drop its requirement that participating doctors serve all of Aetna's health plans, including HMO's.</p>
