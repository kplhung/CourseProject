        <p>Two lawmakers, one a Republican and the other a Democrat, hope to meet with Taiwan's new president during his overnight layover in California on Sunday despite warnings from the State Department that the transit visa granted to him precludes public events, officials said today.</p>
        <p>The proposed meeting with President Chen Shui-bian, which immediately drew vigorous protests from China, comes as President Clinton, party officials and thousands of news reporters converge in Los Angeles for the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>It is the latest example of domestic brinkmanship over Taiwan, a democratic island that enjoys broad support among members of Congress but is considered a renegade province by China.</p>
        <p>The United States transferred diplomatic relations from the Republic of China on Taiwan to the People's Republic of China in 1979, but has kept up unofficial ties with Taiwan.</p>
        <p>In 1995, under pressure from Congress, the Clinton administration granted a visa to Taiwan's president at the time, Lee Teng-hui, to visit his alma mater, Cornell University, in Ithaca, N.Y. Although this was billed as a private visit, China protested by withdrawing its ambassador from the United States and conducting war games that culminated in the firing of missiles near Taiwan.</p>
        <p>Representatives Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican, and Sam Gejdenson, a Democrat from Connecticut, said they would seek to meet with Mr. Chen, perhaps in the Long Beach hotel where he is expected to rest overnight before continuing on to the Caribbean on Monday.</p>
        <p>''I hope and expect to meet with President Chen in Los Angeles,'' said Mr. Gejdenson, the ranking Democrat on the House International Relations Committee. ''President Chen can provide us all with a unique perspective on developments in the Asia-Pacific region, including mainland China.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gejdenson portrayed the proposed meeting as ''private,'' and asserted, ''I don't believe that the State Department should attempt to shut off this dialogue.''</p>
        <p>Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the transit visa granted to Mr. Chen was done ''for the safety, convenience and comfort of the traveler'' and would rule out public meetings or contacts with the news media.</p>
        <p>Administration officials noted, however, that Mr. Chen would not be physically restricted to the Los Angeles airport, leaving them largely powerless to bar encounters they view as inappropriate.</p>
        <p>''Let's just stick with the fact that this is a transit,'' Mr. Boucher said. ''We would expect the activities to be consistent with that.'' He added: ''There are certainly not going to be any meetings with administration officials.''</p>
        <p>As a courtesy, Mr. Chen will be greeted by the chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, the nominally private organization that handles Washington's unofficial diplomatic relations with the island, Mr. Boucher said.</p>
        <p>Chinese officials angrily criticized what they said was an attempt by the lawmakers to showcase American support for an independent Taiwan with cameras already trained on Los Angeles for the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>Yuan Zhang, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here, said Beijing had been given assurances by the administration that Mr. Chen would not play politics on American soil.</p>
        <p>''Every time they say it's a private visit, only for the comfort and convenience of the traveler,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''But once the arrangement is made, the Taiwanese officials take advantage of this to engage in separatist activity.''</p>
        <p>Aides to the lawmakers said President Chen's supporters had pressed eagerly for the meeting, but Mr. Chen, who in the past advocated formal independence for Taiwan, has so far failed to commit himself to it because of pressure from the administration. The State Department declined to characterize its contacts with Taiwan.</p>
