        <p>Eight years after Ross Perot burst into American politics, his Reform Party split today into separate conventions that will each produce a nominee claiming to be the party's true presidential candidate and the rightful recipient of $12.6 million in federal campaign money.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Perot kept his distance, remaining in Dallas and showing no sign of trying to heal his party from behind the scenes, the crucial issue before the 600 delegates at the dueling conventions was not just whom to nominate but how to save the party from self-destruction.</p>
        <p>Each side began its three-day nominating process late this afternoon by seating delegates and building enthusiasm for its candidate with a series of speeches and video presentations. But it was clear that the squabbling that erupted here was unlikely to end with the nominations. With so much money at stake, many people here say the fight seems certain to end up in the courts.</p>
        <p>The immediate cause of the noisy and deep divide was Patrick J. Buchanan. Mr. Buchanan, a one-time Republican and hard-right political commentator, was urged to join the party late last year by allies of Mr. Perot. But they could only stand by as Mr. Buchanan went on to take over many of the party's state organizations, in good part because most of them fell into disarray after Mr. Perot dropped out of politics two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan, an accomplished political strategist, was able to stuff the dispirited local ranks with followers from his days on the edges of the Republican Party. He rode into Long Beach with the most delegates, confidently declaring this morning that he would be the party's nominee because ''we've won it fair and square.'' The old Reform guard, he said, should ''give it up'' and make way for the new guard.</p>
        <p>The old guard, supporters of Mr. Perot who were present at the founding in 1992, was having none of that. They split, taking their placards, chants and mumbles to another convention hall down the street. Their preferred nominee, John Hagelin, a physicist who previously ran twice for president on the Natural Law Party ticket, asserted that he, not Mr. Buchanan, would represent the true Reform Party in the fall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagelin predicted that the strength of his run would at least equal that of Mr. Perot in 1992, when the billionaire Texan made political history by spending millions from his personal fortune to capture almost 20 percent of the popular vote.</p>
        <p>''We're going to reach back to the 20 million people who voted for Ross Perot in 1992,'' Mr. Hagelin said, ''the people who are not looking for a right-wing extremist.''</p>
        <p>That was political music to the ears of old Perot allies. They do not necessarily all pine for Mr. Perot's return, but many describe themselves as true believers in the reform agenda that he began advocating a decade ago.</p>
        <p>''I feel better about things now that we've split off from the Buchananites,'' said Leroy Mueller, a retired machinery parts distributor from Rhinelander, Wis. ''But I worry still about the party's future. I was with Ross from the start, from back in 1992, and he never meant for the party to have a right-wing slant. Reform was his thing -- reform the government -- not abortion and gun control and prayers and the like. Can we ever get it back to the way Ross had it, to the time when we were all excited and ginned up and had our eyes on a new horizon? I just don't know.''</p>
        <p>The Buchananites had their eyes on their own horizon.</p>
        <p>''Look,'' said Paul Rezel, an orthopedist from Fort Wayne, Ind., ''reform is fine but I came to the Reform Party because Pat Buchanan was the Reform Party. The Republicans weren't doing it for me, and neither were the Democrats. What Pat says is what I care about.''</p>
        <p>The more attention the squabbling attracts, the more the Reform Party may affect the fortunes of the Republican ticket. The more visibility that Mr. Buchanan gains, the greater the effect he may have on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, especially if he can get into presidential debates.</p>
        <p>For a few nervous moments today, it appeared that the feuding factions would clash. After Mr. Hagelin's first news conference at a nearby hotel, his supporters marched into the Convention Center chanting, ''Reform, reform, reform.'' Inside, the pro-Buchanan delegates were gathering, but as the Hagelin group approached, Gerald M. Moan, the Buchanan faction's acting chairman, addressed the Buchanan delegates in a loud voice, saying, ''I'm asking you to be nonconfrontational. We are professional and hospitable.''</p>
        <p>With that, the Buchanan supporters allowed the Hagelin group to proceed to the front of the delegate meeting room, where they were turned away because of questions over their registration. After singing ''We Shall Overcome,'' they reversed their course and walked toward the Performing Arts Center.</p>
        <p>While ideology is the source of much of the discord within the party, the financial question looms large, too. Initially, the Federal Election Commission will have to decide which factions get the money. But no one here expects that decision to stand without a court challenge.</p>
        <p>Supporters of Mr. Hagelin said today that they had filed an administrative complaint with the Federal Election Commission, contending that the Buchanan forces were able to amass a majority of delegates because he broke party rules to get them elected and also broke party rules over how primaries were conducted.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the commission, Sharon Snyder, said the complaint arrived this morning.</p>
        <p>Leonard A. Goldman, a lawyer representing Mr. Hagelin's campaign, said the complaint contended that Mr. Buchanan submitted names of ineligible voters to be sent primary ballots, specifically that the names were contributors to Mr. Buchanan's former presidential campaigns as a Republican. He also said the complaint contended that Buchanan allies illegally took control of a pre-convention party meeting here on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldman said that the complaint argues that, for both reasons, Mr. Buchanan should be disqualified from the primary and barred from receiving the federal money.</p>
        <p>While sidestepping the question of who their names are, Mr. Buchanan said today his officials have consistently argued that they followed rules in submitting names. They also asserted that they did nothing improper at the Tuesday meeting.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the complaint represents the opening gambit in what could be a long administrative and legal process before the commission releases the money to anyone. The party is eligible for the federal money because Mr. Perot surpassed a threshold of 5 percent of the popular vote in the 1996 election. Both campaigns said that money would play a huge role in getting the candidate and his issues before voters -- even though the amount paled in comparison with the $67.5 million that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore each received as the nominee of a major party.</p>
        <p>By commission rules, once the complaint is received, the panel has five days to notify the defendant, who then has 15 days to respond. Then, after a review of the charges and defense, the panel can dismiss the complaint or find reason to believe violations of election law occurred, triggering an investigation.</p>
        <p>If commission lawyers then believe violations have taken place, the defendants have 15 days to argue why they should not be cited for violations. If their arguments fail, the two parties are required to begin settlement talks. And if those efforts fail, the matter goes before the federal court of appeals in Washington.</p>
        <p>But even without an investigation, Ms. Snyder said, if two requests for the money are submitted -- and both sides here said they would seek it -- the commission could take as long as 15 days to consider the requests, after which it could deny one or both.</p>
        <p>In either case, she said, the matter would likely end up in court.</p>
        <p>Once the dual conventions began, they proceeded on calm and similar tracks. The early hours of each were spent on considering challenges to delegates. About two-thirds of the original 596 were attending the pro-Buchanan session, the other third at the pro-Hagelin meeting.</p>
