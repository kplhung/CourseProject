        <p>They entered the pool resembling speedskaters more than swimmers, wearing bodysuits from neck to ankle, for the first major showdown at the United States Olympic trials.</p>
        <p>When the swimmers churned to the finish in the women's 100-meter butterfly, Jenny Thompson had won her 24th career national championship, touching first in 57.78 seconds, ahead of Dara Torres, who took second in 57.86. The winning time was not a world or national record, but the 27-year-old Thompson took great satisfaction in qualifying in an individual event for the 2000 Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, she failed to taper her training properly, developed insomnia from stress and did not qualify for the Atlanta Olympics in any individual event. She is tied with the speedskater Bonnie Blair for most gold medals won by an American woman -- five -- but all of Thompson's victories have come in relays. In Sydney, she will get another chance to win an event that relies on her alone against the clock. As a victory medal was slipped around her neck tonight, she kissed it.</p>
        <p>''It's a step along the way; my real goal is to win in Sydney,'' Thompson said. ''This is a huge part of it. There's a lot of anxiety. There's such relief and happiness that I get this opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Finishing second was no less impressive for Torres, the holder of two gold medals in Olympic relays who returned to competitive swimming last year after a seven-year layoff. She fell short of the national record of 57.58 she set in Wednesday's preliminaries, but, at 33, Torres will now become the first American swimmer to compete in four Olympics.</p>
        <p>In a gripping finish to the men's 400-meter individual medley, the Olympic champion and world record-holder Tom Dolan of Arlington, Va., moved from third to first over the final 50 meters to win in 4 minutes 13.72 seconds. His final freestyle split of 28.08 reeled in Erik Vendt of North Easton, Mass., who finished second in 4:13.89. Dolan appeared vulnerable this season after knee surgery, a bout with depression and the death of his grandfather, to whom he was very close. Ill the past two weeks, he appeared to be in trouble at the final turn, but he used his 6-foot-6 frame to power home.</p>
        <p>In the men's 100 breaststroke, Ed Moses of Burke, Va., set an American record of 1:00.54, while Diana Munz of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, won the women's 400 freestyle in 4:08.71.</p>
        <p>Thompson and Torres are coached by Richard Quick in Palo Alto, Calif., but they train separately. Both are chasing gold medals in the same events -- the 100 butterfly and the 50- and 100-meter freestyles -- which has created a natural tension between athletes with voracious appetites for winning.</p>
        <p>Similarly talented, the swimmers differ in personality. Torres is an ebullient former model who grew up in Beverly Hills. Thompson grew up in Dover, N.H., a model of Yankee circumspection, and is headed to medical school at Columbia University.</p>
        <p>Thompson reached 50 meters six-hundredths of a second behind Torres, but overtook her down the homestretch. Afterward, she and Torres hugged and slapped hands. Last year, Thompson set a world record of 57.88 seconds, breaking a mark by Mary T. Meagher that had stood for 18 years. In Sydney, she and Torres will be chasing the current world record of 56.64 seconds, set on July 22 by Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>How has Torres produced so much speed after a seven-year layoff? Given the demonstrated cheating over the last three decades by East German, Chinese and American athletes, any remarkable performance by female swimmers brings immediate suspicion.</p>
        <p>Chiseled and wide-shouldered at 5 feet 11 inches, 160 pounds, Torres entered this season with a career best in the 100 of a relatively modest 1:00.21. She said she was using no banned substances. ''If I ever thought there was an athlete of mine possibly cheating, I wouldn't coach them for one more second,'' Quick said.</p>
        <p>Torres, who has never failed a drug test, performs an exhaustive dry-land regimen of flexibility and weight training. The new hydromatic suits are said to increase speed by up to 3 percent.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to think we're on the cutting edge of what can be done nutritionally and with supplements,'' Quick said. ''You can achieve -- it just takes longer -- what a steroid athlete achieves.''</p>
        <p>For several months, Torres and Thompson have been working with Glen Luepnitz, who holds a doctorate in immunology and nutrition and who operates a cancer clinic in Austin, Tex. With a revolutionary approach to nutrition, Luepnitz said, the swimmers can counter competitors who use such banned substances as human growth hormone and EPO -- synthetic versions of hormones for which tests have not been implemented. ''People see Dara and say the only way her body can get that way is that she must be on drugs,'' Luepnitz said. ''I can't tell you how furious that makes me.''</p>
        <p>Torres and Thompson, who is also 5-11 and 160, eat six meals a day, have their blood drawn and analyzed every two weeks and adhere to a precise intake of supplements and amino acids that involves as many as 20 pills a day, Luepnitz said. Small amounts of creatine, the legal but controversial muscle enhancer, are also used, he said, along with 100 grams of additional protein daily to build musculature. Their diet consists heavily of vegetables, while starches are reduced to minimize the buildup of subcutaneous fat.</p>
        <p>Amino acids that stimulate natural production of growth hormone allow the athletes to train harder and longer and recover more quickly, Luepnitz said. Iron supplements, amino acids, minerals and B-complex vitamins aid in increasing red blood cell levels, legally countering the illicit use of the endurance drug EPO by athletes who cheat, he said.</p>
        <p>''We can beat the cheaters without cheating,'' Luepnitz said.</p>
        <p>Other scientists cautioned that there have been few peer-review studies on the effect of supplements and amino acids in enhancing the performance of elite athletes. ''There are absolutely no studies looking at 20 to 25 things taken together,'' said Dr. Gary Green, an internist at U.C.L.A. who is chairman of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's drug-testing program.</p>
        <p>''My opinion is that these results are achieved through hard work and training and technique more than anything else,'' Green said. ''I'm not going to rule out the placebo effect in events decided by hundredths of a second. If you tell someone that they will swim faster if they take something, they believe it.''</p>
