        <p>As the Democratic National Convention nears, Vice President Al Gore's choice of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running mate has chilled wealthy Hollywood Democrats, who are upset that Mr. Lieberman is one of the Senate's most vocal critics of the entertainment industry.</p>
        <p>With moguls like David Geffen, one of the owners of Dreamworks, and stars like Barbra Streisand set to open their gated compounds for Democratic fund-raisers, Hollywood is hardly in a mood to voice nervousness about Mr. Lieberman publicly.</p>

        <p>''It's so ironic -- they pick the chief Democratic critic of Clinton as well as Hollywood,'' said Tom Strickler, a a Republican who supports Gov. George W. Bush for president.  Article, Page A17.</p>
