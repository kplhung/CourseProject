        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>''AFRICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE COLLECTION OF BEATRICE RIESE,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sept. 10). Beatrice Riese, a New York abstract painter who saw her first African sculpture in 1937 in Paris, has collected a wealth of impressive objects, 30 of which are in this show. They include fine bronze Benin plaques and a female ancestor mask from Angola with scars like tears on its cheeks. Especially magnetic is a Songye power figure with a bunched-up body and a sideways-looking face, a compact monument to ferocity.

        <p>''AFRICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE COLLECTION OF BEATRICE RIESE,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sept. 10). Beatrice Riese, a New York abstract painter who saw her first African sculpture in 1937 in Paris, has collected a wealth of impressive objects, 30 of which are in this show.

Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ANNI ALBERS, Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Aug. 20). This survey of arguably the most influential textile artist of the 20th century is part retrospective, part weaving seminar, part biography -- and altogether fascinating. It traces the development of Albers's work from her student days at the Bauhaus to Black Mountain College, where she taught with her husband, Josef. It contrasts her designs for commercial fabrics, which emphasized structure and materials in new ways, with her pictorially striking hand-loomed pieces. A gallery of photographs, letters, personal memorabilia and pre-Columbian textile fragments she collected reflects her character and quietly glamorous personal style. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Tuesdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50, students and senior citizens; free for children under 12 (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>''AMERICAN SPECTRUM: PAINTINGS AND SCULPTURE FROM THE SMITH COLLEGE MUSEUM OF ART,'' National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, between 89th and 90th Streets, (212) 369-4880 (through Sept. 10). The Smith College Museum of Art cuts a swath of some 250 years in American art, and here and there in this show -- works on loan to the academy while the Smith museum is renovated -- there is something particularly enticing. Among the highlights are Edward Hopper's painting of Helen Hayes's Nyack, N.Y., house, ''Pretty Penny''; Florine Stettheimer's portrait of the art critic Henry McBride; and the ''Mourning Picture'' by Edwin Romanzo Elmer. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $4.50, students and the elderly (John Russell).</p>
        <p>* ''THE ART OF WILLIAM EDMONDSON,'' Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, (212) 595-9533 (through Aug. 27). All creatures, celestial, human and animal, find their way into the limestone sculpture of Edmondson (1874-1951) and the results feel like an epic folk opera: score by Scott Joplin, libretto by Aesop, choreography by the great master dancers of Yorubaland. This exhibition also includes photographs of the artist by Edward Weston, Consuelo Kanaga and Louise Dahl-Wolfe, showing him at home in Nashville, where, at 59, he began to carve gravestones and garden ornaments for the local African-American community. In 1937 he made a solo debut at the Museum of Modern Art, and he has been part of the American pantheon ever since. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''THE CHANGING FACE OF LIBERTY: FEMALE ALLEGORIES OF AMERICA,'' New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Sept. 3). Uncle Sam, the allegorical male representative of the United States, has always had a female counterpart, the damsel dressed in flowing robes who came to symbolize Liberty. As a sequel to its ''Uncle Sam'' show, the historical society mounted this very lively display of his iconic sister in her many guises, from ''L'Amerique,'' an Indian princess with feathers in her hair who represented the New World in post-Columbus maps, to the matronly Lady Liberty portrayed in the Bartholdi statue that stands in New York Harbor. The fascinating story of Liberty's evolution is told in posters, cartoons, illustrations and photographs. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students over 12 and the elderly (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>* CHARDIN, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 3). This retrospective doesn't tell us much that wasn't already known about Jean-Simeon Chardin, but there's nothing wrong with being reminded occasionally of what great painting is. The art, by contrast with so much Rococo art, is about love, not sex. Quiet and deliberation were Chardin's essential ingredients, combined with a perfect mastery of abstract form. He was the best still-life painter ever because he made the most of the least, his work focusing on the same humble cups and pans in one painting after another, one decade after another. The result was a compilation of precise little observations that together make as true a record of the value of seeing as exists in the history of art. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''GLASS WORKS: EMERGING ARTISTS,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sept. 3). Thirteen Brooklyn artists were each invited to produce a glass artwork in response to a piece from the permanent collection. Their creations are distributed throughout the museum, each presented near the work that inspired it. Highlights include Robert Panepinto's heavy blown-glass vase with the image of an Indian deity traced inside; a thick, frosted tortoise shell shield by Himiko Ohta; Beth Lipman's three-dimensional copy of a complicated 19th-century American still-life painting; and Jeff Zimmerman's mirrored, suspended bulbous form, a deliberately contrary response to Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait's sentimental painting of a girl and a fawn. Hours and admission: See above (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>BARBARA KRUGER, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Oct. 22). A lot has changed about the art world in the 20 years or so since Barbara Kruger came onto the scene with her snappy photomontages, but a lot has not changed about her work. Her trademark red, white and black text-and-photograph montage is a brand product of the immediate past. Dense and noisy, this retrospective, including audio embellishments, has an intended carnival atmosphere without frivolity. Your reaction will necessarily depend upon a blend of generational sympathy, political concord, aesthetic expectation and tolerance for sarcasm. Ms. Kruger was one of the 80's artists adapting Conceptualism via mass- media forms for political ends, thereby helping to broaden the purview of contemporary art and make the art world more sex-balanced. Young artists today reacting against her sort of political stridency now explore subtler, more aesthetically varied routes toward expressions of selfhood. Ms. Kruger, in a sense, helped to pave the way for her own diminished currency, which for a political artist like her may be viewed as a kind of success. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''MAKING CHOICES, 1920-1960,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Sept. 26). The main event at the Modern these days is the museum itself. This has been the case since last fall, when the project ''MOMA 2000'' began the first of what will be three successive top-to-bottom reinstallations of the permanent collection galleries. The affair has been billed as a test drive for the future, a chance for an institution to rethink the modern art tradition that it helped invent and to consider its own identity in what is often called a postmodern world. This second installment, which looks denser, weirder, messier and more truly modern (or maybe postmodern) than the first, is a big leap in the right direction. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''MANHATTAN CONTRASTS: 20TH-CENTURY PAINTINGS OF NEW YORK,'' New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Aug. 27). This modest show of 20th-century paintings of New York from the society's collections focuses on painting as documentary representation. This means mostly pictures of buildings seen from near and far, along with a few genre scenes. Quality ranges from journeyman competence to high academic proficiency. But the show is also meant to prompt thought about the society's future collecting, and its most recent acquisition -- a neo-Pop work by Martin Wong -- suggests a promising expansion of parameters. It is exciting to imagine what this show could look like in the year 2100. Hours and admission: See above (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ALICE NEEL, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Sept. 17). The pleasures of this rewarding exhibition are dampened by the feeling that Neel's long, fruitful career could have sustained a larger effort, one that parses her evolution chapter and verse, on paper and canvas, instead of concentrating on the well-known portraits of her last 25 years. These portraits, which usually feature family members or denizens of the art world, are frequently great and always marvelously loquacious. Color, shape and brushwork, along with Neel's signature distortions of body and face, all have their say, and both the painterly process and the human psyche are repeatedly laid bare. Neel, never less than interesting and always striving, operated in the gap between the Stieglitz circle and the Abstract Expressionists with a fruitfulness matched only by Stuart Davis; like his late work, hers is an indelible part of the postwar period. It's time for a full-dress, or in Whitney terms, a two-floor, treatment. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''OTHER PICTURES: VERNACULAR PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE THOMAS WALTHER COLLECTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 27). A deceptively modest and sublimely endearing exhibition of several dozen photographs by anonymous amateurs, shot between the 1910's and 1960's, the heyday of the black-and-white snapshot, Surrealism and New Vision photography. They are a catalog of aspiring masterpieces in a modernist mode and serendipitous catastrophes. In the extraordinary way such things happen, these pictures traveled from drugstore to family album to attic to Dumpster to flea market into the hands of some scavenging dealer-collector, whereupon they became items on the art market, until finally wending their way to their present location. Isn't life amazing sometimes? Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''PAINTERS IN PARIS: 1895-1950,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Dec. 31). This show of more than 100 paintings celebrates the Met's acquisitions of works by School of Paris painters, going back to 1946 when Gertrude Stein bequeathed her portrait, done by Picasso in 1906. The portrait served as a cornerstone for later acquisitions in the field, particularly over the last 20 years. The museum's increasing interest and diligent wooing of collectors have brought not only single works but also groups and entire holdings, like the 18 major objects bequeathed by Florene M. Schoenborn in 1995 and the Jacques and Natasha Gelman trove of 85 masterpieces accessioned in 1998. The treasures on view include works by some of the 20th century's greatest: Bonnard, Braque, Chagall, de Chirico, Derain, Gris, Leger, Matisse, Miro, Modigliani and Picasso, in an animated arrangement that should beguile the most jaded Met-goer. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''1900: ART AT THE CROSSROADS,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 10). A wacky exercise in historical simulation, the excuse being a new century. It is hard to remember the last time so many bad pictures were in one place at one time, unless you consider eBay a place. There is also a good deal of excellent art mixed in among the dogs, and sometimes what is best is not what you would expect, which is partly the show's point. We're meant to look anew at a moment 100 years ago when it was not yet clear who would be the pioneers in the 20th century and who would be forgotten. Thus recapturing innocence, we can make connections that for the sake of simplification or because of ignorance art historians have glossed over. The show provides just enough compensatory rewards for its schlock quotient and whatever might be unclear about its inclusionary standards. But patience is required. The weak-hearted and modern-day cultural Pharisees may never get past the shock of confronting so much of the art that the abstractionists were rebelling against in a museum created as a shrine to 20th-century abstraction. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $7, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''RESERVATION X: THE POWER OF PLACE,'' National Museum of the America Indian, Smithsonian Institution, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 668-6624 (through Aug. 20). This show of installations by seven artists from Canada and the United States is a lean, clean, impeccably presented take on the tangled subject of what it means to be Native American today. The reservation, as a place and as a state of mind, is the central metaphor. All of the artists were born or have lived on one, and they tend to view these set-aside territories as preserves rather than prisons, places where endangered cultures can, potentially at least, remain both intact and be open to change. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission is free (Cotter)</p>
        <p>''RESOLUTIONS: A STITCH IN TIME,'' American Craft Museum, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535 (through Sept. 3). The latest effort by the veteran feminist artist Judy Chicago is a good candidate for worst museum show of the year. A series of posterlike pictures combine familiar verbal slogans and bland, cartoonish illustrations -- as in ''Hitch Your Wagon to a Star,'' which features a family of hopeful African-Americans in an old wooden wagon. Various forms of needlework added by skilled collaborators, all women, embellish the pictures. At the center, a life-size sculpture of a heroic maternal figure made of beige plastic has an embroidered valentine heart and the words, inscribed in many languages, ''Find it in your heart.'' Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursday to 8 p.m. Admission $5; $2.50 for students and the elderly (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* ''MARTHA ROSLER: POSITIONS IN THE LIFE WORLD,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Oct. 8), and International Center of Photography, Fifth Avenue at 94th Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Oct. 1). This 30-year-career retrospective is also a first major museum show for a seminal Brooklyn-born artist, and even spread over two venues, it's of a piece: crowded, agitated, funny and political. Ms. Rosler was involved in the peace movement and feminism in the 1960's and responded with art that combined moral brashness and a television-generation sense of the absurd. Aware of the co-opting power of the market, she chose media that were either ephemeral or easily reproduced and distributed. The show mixes all of them together, with video and photography -- her best work -- concentrated uptown and installations (including a cash-and-carry garage sale) at the New Museum. Despite her self-description as a ''ham-fisted'' artist, her work is full of subtleties. It may have little to say to a viewer for whom taste, style and beauty are the exclusive building blocks of art, but as an art of ideas-that-lead-actions, its deeply skeptical utopianism is as vital now as it was in the past. Hours at the New Museum: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 p.m. New Museum admission: $6 or $3 for students, artists and the elderly. Hours at the International Center of Photography: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Center admission: $6 or $4 for students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''TIBOROCITY: DESIGN AND UNDESIGN BY TIBOR KALMAN,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Aug. 20). A survey of the busy career, subversive attitudes and contradictory ambitions of the graphic designer. Kalman (1949-1999) urged greater social awareness on the design and advertising profession, even though its raison d'etre was to move products. The work that his company, M &amp; Company, created in the 1980's for chic clients like Isaac Mizrahi, the Talking Heads, the Manhattan restaurant Florent and Interview magazine is in evidence. Also represented are the 13 issues of Colors, the magazine he created and edited for the Italian clothing manufacturer Benetton in the early 90's. There is plenty of proof here that most graphic design has a limited shelf life and that even socially conscientious designers create their share of useless baubles. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).</p>
        <p>''TREASURES FROM THE ROYAL TOMBS OF UR,'' Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Sept. 10). The Sumerians flourished in third-millennium Mesopotamia, creating one of the earliest civilizations as they devised such essentials as writing, numbers, the wheel and irrigation methods. This sumptuous exhibition attests to their visual achievement with gold, silver and carved calcite vessels; weapons, tools and cylinder seals; and ingenious jewelry made of lapis lazuli, carnelian and gold. On view as well are several of art history's most familiar, if least exhibited, masterpieces. All belong to the University of Pennsylvania and are part of one of archaeology's greatest discoveries: the intact, lavishly equipped royal tombs excavated at Ur in the 1920's by C. Leonard Woolley. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6, students and the elderly (Smith).</p>
        <p>''THE WORLD OF SCHOLARS' ROCKS: GARDENS, STUDIOS AND PAINTINGS,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 81st Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 20). The odd-shaped tabletop objects from China known as scholars' rocks, shaped by nature and human intervention, rate scant mention in art history books. But they enjoyed a vogue in New York as pet rocks. This exhibition wisely places them in the larger context of Chinese culture by setting a choice selection of rocks among historical paintings whose subjects they both echoed and inspired. The paintings, drawn from the museum's constantly rotating collection, are wonderful; the rocks look good, too, and the Met's Ming-style Astor Court, with its own giant moonscape stones, fits right into the prevailing theme. Hours and admissions: See above (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>''AIR-CONDITIONED: INTERIORS,'' Bonni Benrubi, 52 East 76th Street, (212) 517-3766 (through Aug. 31). Two dozen photographers look inward in this rich selection of interior views. Included are Jennette Williams's luminous indoor swimming pool scenes; Jed Devine's contemplative, near-Minimalist pictures in a New York loft; Shellburne Thurber's haunting picture of a double bed in a decaying abandoned house; Abelardo Morell's dusky shot of wet footprints on a bathroom floor; Birney Imes's shots inside funky clubs in the Deep South; and Mark Citret's mysterious image of a perfectly empty room (Johnson).</p>
        <p>JAMES LEE BYARS, ''The Poetic Conceit and Other Black Works,'' Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623 (through tomorrow; reopens Aug. 28 to Sept. 16). Relentlessly pursuing perfection, the conceptualist Byars (1932-1997) was a performer and object maker in the tradition of Duchamp. His influences included Zen philosophy and Noh drama, and his work ran to austere shapes of gold, marble, glass and paper. In his legendary performances he did things like enveloping 100 nude volunteers in a single overall garment and arranging in an exactly symmetrical pattern 100 white marbles on the floor of an all-white room. His favorite colors were red, gold, black and white, but this small show is devoted to works in black, including ''The New Moon'' (1993), a poetic wall arrangement of seven black crescents cut from silk paper, each covered by a crescent of glass that gives it a silvery edge. Byars's own presence was very much part of his work, and it's not at all surprising that his fey anima still seems to inhabit it (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''FLUID FLOW,'' James Graham &amp; Sons, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 535-5767 (through Aug. 25). Fluidity as process, material and subject is captured in this diverse show. It includes psychodelically marbelized paintings by Carolanna Parlato; tiny, spiraling pattern drawings by James Siena; smoke evoked by wispy, meandering lines in a painting by Karen Arm; dense, gray postcard-size seascapes by Michael Blodget; compact, resin-coated fields of haloed blood drops by Jess von der Ahe; and Harold Edgerton's famous splashing milk drop rendered in porcelain by Jennifer Bolande (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RONNIE LANDFIELD/ DAN CHRISTENSEN, Salander-O'Reilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606 (through Sept. 1). Both these contemporary painters look as if they belong more to the 1960's than to the present. Mr. Landfield makes big stain paintings with broad swaths of pure color that call to mind the Color Field paintings of Friedel Dzubas. Mr. Christensen, also a stain painter, makes blurry white lines on black fields, creating compositions that read at once as large, impulsive doodles in neon and as diagrams of possibly cosmic significance (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>''DRAWINGS BY 20TH-CENTURY AND CONTEMPORARY MASTERS,'' Forum Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 355-4545 (through Sept. 1). With work ranging from Picasso and Matisse to contemporaries like William Beckman and Robert Cottingham, this selection of more that 60 drawings is loaded with good works. Some highlights include a finely drawn Cubist cityscape by Lyonel Feininger; a radiantly colorful crayon picture of mill buildings by Oscar Bluemner; a pair of sensuously exploded fantasy girls by Willem de Kooning; and David Levine's caricature of the museum mogul Thomas Krens (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>MARI EASTMAN, Bronwyn Keenan Gallery, 3 Crosby Street, SoHo (212) 431-5083 (through Aug. 31). An engaging debut exhibition in which drawing and all kinds of painting occur on paper, canvas, the wall and a couple of handmade skirts. Tying it all together is a spray-painted mountain range that travels the entire length of the gallery, and a penchant for Romantic subject matter that includes a view of Copenhagen, a lone cowboy, glamorous models and deer. But the main strength are the paintings themselves, with their deft mix of quirky images, ad hoc techniques and offhand beauty (Smith).</p>
        <p>''FLAMING JUNE,'' Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, (212) 925-4338; online at Onview.com (through Aug. 23). The five artists in this collaboration between a regular gallery and a cyber-gallery deal variously with summery desires. Christopher Patch paints funky little watercolors of brick barbecues and patio furniture; Yvette Brackman's photographs record a curiously staid, staged orgy in the woods; Roe Etheridge's blurry, floral still lifes were made with a pinhole camera; John White C. makes mock-kitschy pictures of beautiful girls; Tatiana Jensen digitally abstracts a bouquet of daisies (Johnson).</p>
        <p>GERALD KAMITAKI, Staff USA, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-9700 (through Aug. 26). For his second New York solo show, Mr. Kamitaki has performed a clever, exhaustive exercise in the deconstruction of an art magazine. First he removed every page of the May 2000 issue of Artforum; then he cut neat circles into each and rotated the rings, creating kaleidoscopic alterations. Hung in numerical order, the pages generate an interesting tension between art and journalism (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MASATOMO KURIYA, Yancey Richardson, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-1255 (through Aug. 25). There is a certain undeniable beauty in this Japanese photographer's richly colored images of carefully arranged flowers in antique containers. Early Modernists like Weston and Strand come to mind, but the pictures also hover uncomfortably close to the line between art and high-end kitsch (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''THE LOWER EAST SIDE: 1906-1993,'' Susan Teller, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-7335 (through Aug. 24). Among more than 40 social realist images of Lower East Side life in this print and drawing exhibition, a few gems stand out: a densely etched nocturnal view from the Williamsburg Bridge by Martin Lewis; a Piranesian construction site in drypoint by G. L. Briem; a delicate silverpoint drawing of a spacious park by Edith Kramer; and masterly, postcard-size wood engravings by Bernard Brussel-Smith (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''LUX ET TENEBRAE,'' Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through Sept. 9). This fine selection from 20 years worth of Peter Blum's print publishing includes a giant, crisp woodcut by Alex Katz; many surreal autobiographical etchings by Louise Bourgeois; exquisitely refined Constructivist compositions by David Rabinowitch; an allegory of racism in the tropics, done in over-ripe colors by Eric Fischl; sensuous yet cerebral colored woodcut checkerboards by Sherrie Levine; and floating blocks made of squiggly red lines by Yukinori Yanagi (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''NEO,'' Exit Art, 548 Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 966-7745 (through Aug. 19). This show of young or hitherto underexposed artists is bursting with imaginative energy and reckless ambition. Eung Ho Park has suspended a towering three-dimensional grid of chained-together bowling balls from the ceiling; Scott Reynold's neat wooden grids with inflated balloon elements have sly Freudian implications; Han Sam Son's amazing cardboard wall work looks like the bark surface of a giant tree; Peter Coe's smooth, white triptych with raised cellular forms exudes a trippy retro-futurism (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''SONIC MATTERS, SONIC KOLLABORATIONS,'' Printed Matter, 77 Wooster Street, (212) 925-0325 (through Sept. 9). Young artists are always aspiring to the equivalent of rock star status. The members of the music collective called Sonic Youth are the real thing. In the the early 1980's, they formed an artists' band that was integral to the downtown club scene in and around the East Village. In addition to producing records, they have turned out poetry, art and promotional graphics, books and self-published magazines. Examples of all these are on view here, and although the material is archival, its anarchic energy still generates heat (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''SUMMER SHOW,'' DFN, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 334-3400 (through Aug. 18). Mixed in among the 53 works in this cheerfully uneven hodgepodge of a show are pictures of sunbathers by Joan Semmel; a large, darkly expressionistic beach scene in charcoal by Susan Grossman; small, woozily distorted suburban images by Steve Mumford; a gloomy, swampy landscape painted by William McCarthy; and a painting of a naked sunbather by Elyse Taylor, with a strategically placed book (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>GERMAINE BROOKS/LORI TASCHLER, Jay Grimm, 505 West 28th Street, (212) 564-7662 (through Aug. 18). Two painters offer slight but charming faux-naive pictures of, respectively, spaces and people. Ms. Taschler paints evocatively empty subjects -- a swimming pool or theater doors guarded by stanchions and a rope -- in muted colors with matching, heavily painted frames; her deft, soft-focused pastels are better. Ms. Brooks portrays odd cartoonish characters like a skinny-armed girl in clown makeup and a harlequin dress (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''THE CITY,'' Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3335 (through Aug. 18). This 21-artist show approaches metropolitan experience from lots of different angles, including Thomas Struth's photograph of a deserted street in Rome; Dylan Stone's project of photographing every building in New York City; Miranda Maher's photographs of constellations made from sidewalk spots; a highly detailed imaginary map by Lordy Rodriguez; and a dense, delirious cityscape made from New York City postcards by Darren Kraft (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''COOL,'' Wessel and O'Connor, 242 West 26th Street, (212) 242-8811 (through Aug. 25). The title of this 10-photographer show refers not to subject matter but to a certain formal reserve. Among the best works are lush white-on-white images of flowers by Ron van Dongen; rich blue cyanotype still lifes by John Dugdale; small, highly ordered images of salt piles and former slave huts on the island of Bonaire by Tom Hawkins; and complex pictures of shadows and reflections in the street by Bruce Cratsley (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''FAMILY TREE,'' Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets, (212) 989-7600 (through Aug. 25). Five photographers deal with relations between self and family. Leo Rubinfien's large, touching pictures portray his young, oddly beautiful daughter. Karl Baden's funny series of word and picture montages chronicle his endurance of his wife's pregnancy; Maria Meisenberger's photograms of her own nude body are seen through screens of genetic coding; Lois Guarino's self-portraits include hand-wrought symbolic elements; and Laurent Miller's pictures document a private performance using inherited bedsheets blowing in the wind (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MYUNG-OCK LIM, ''A Sacred Place,'' Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, (through Aug. 19). This Korean sculptor has orchestrated an installation of formally and possibly spiritually soothing beauty. Perfect cubes of solid glass stand on black steles refracting fine radiating lines of a wall drawing behind them, while a series of soft-edged glass forms, glowing from lights built into their pedestals, look like melting blocks of ice (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''THE MAGIC CITY,'' Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-2262 (through Aug. 18). Multiculturalism as delirious pluralism animates this six-artist show. Barkley Hendricks' full-figure portraits of urbane African-Americans rendered in a vivid Pop-realist style preside. Tony Gray draws funny cartoons of stereotypical black radicals into the pages of old juvenile history books. Roberto Visani's tribalized guns marry European and African histories. Rina Banerjee updates ''The Arabian Nights.'' Tim Evans layers images of toys, ethnic artifacts and pornographic bodies. And Wangechi Mutu offers a hypnotic video called ''Fate Smuggler'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>SUSAN MASTRANGELO AND JENNY SCOBEL/ CYNTHIA CARLSON/ BARBARA WESTERMANN, Art Resources Transfer, 210 11th Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets, (212) 691-5956 (through Aug. 27). Three rooms, three shows: in the middle, a dialogue between imaginary beautiful girls drawn by Ms. Scobel and lumpy girl heads sculptured by Ms. Mastrangelo; to one side, paintings of dogs or cats with patterned frames on striped walls by the veteran pattern painter and sculptor Ms. Carlson; and, on the other side, mostly white, slightly eccentric Minimalist sculptures by Ms. Westermann, including an elegant simulated drinking fountain bowl (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''100 YEARS OF VERNACULAR SIGNAGE,'' Ricco-Maresca Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819 (through Aug. 18). A selection of painted signs and sculpturelike objects called trade stimulators examines the strain of commercial Americana that presaged Pop Art. Photographs by Walker Evans, William Klein and others reflect the first artistic appreciation of its merits (Smith).</p>
        <p>''OPULENT,'' Cheim &amp; Read, 521 West 23rd Street, (212) 242-7727 (through Sept. 1). ''Opulent'' makes a good case for the visual pleasure principal. It includes Lynda Benglis's lustrous gold intestinal hemisphere; an exotic bronze bell by St. Clair Cemin; paintings of lush profusion by Chris Ofili, Beatriz Milhazes and Richmond Burton; and more orderly stripe or grid-based paintings by Juan Usle and Philip Taaffe. The prize for interesting materials goes to Jeff Perrone's funky stripe paintings made of richly colored sand and buttons (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>LINDA DANIELS AND TAMARA GONZALES, ''A Few of My Favorite Things,'' Cheryl Pelavin, 13 Jay Street, TriBeCa, (212) 925-9424 (through Sept. 9). In very different ways these two artists each deal cheerfully with the sacred. Ms. Daniels makes neat square or diamond-shaped mandala paintings with hypnotic checkerboards and pinwheels motifs. Ms. Gonzales assembles a children's yellow wading pool, strings of Christmas lights, colorful crepe paper decorations and an inflated black smiley-face cartoon character into a funky altar to the Hindu deity Jagannath (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''THE MORRIS MUSEUM: A COLLECTED CENTURY,'' PaineWebber, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212) 713-2885 (through Sept. 8). This miscellaneous sampler from New Jersey's third-largest museum presents selections from all its departments, from paintings to fashion to natural science. The selection includes a bronze statue of Pan by the American Renaissance sculptor Frederick William MacMonnies, beaded Victorian handbags, Navajo rugs, a mechanical Popeye the Sailor toy and a contemporary painting by Wolf Kahn. While almost everything is interesting, nothing in the show is really amazing (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''SIX ABSTRACT PAINTERS,'' Karen McCready, 425 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 243-0439 (through Sept. 1). Emphasis on process is the link in this show. Carleen Sheehan paints lush postcard-size fields of dots, nets and stripes; Margaret Lanzetta layers grid patterns in black, gray and white; Garry Mitchell's loosely gridded pictures are elegantly blurred and richly colored; Beth Miller and Janis Provisor produce drippy, scrawly compositions; and Nicole Parcher mixes gestural drawing and collage (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''AT THE EDGE: A PORTUGUESE FUTURIST -- AMADEO DE SOUZA CARDOSO,'' AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-1704 (through Sept. 16). One of those perfect, dropped-from-the-sky retrospectives, this show introduces a talented and ambitious Portuguese modernist who died at 30 in 1918. In the previous 10 years he had absorbed several budding modern art movements in Paris, especially Cubism and Futurism, combined them with references to things Portuguese and produced vividly colored, carefully calibrated paintings. They seem ahead of their time in their mixing of styles, images, materials and cultural references. His exceptional draftsmanship is shown in a series of ultrarefined drawings that suggest Ingres high on Cubism (Smith).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>''BLOWN AWAY,'' Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205 (through tomorrow). Weapons and war are here treated with ceramic cleverness. Richard Notkin piles more than 500 clay ears in front of a big tile work bearing the image of a mushroom cloud; Charles Krafft nestles delftware pistols in velvet-padded boxes; Luis Miguel Suro produces a line of cartoonish, double-ended ''Assassination-Suicide Pistols''; Laszlo Fekete shows slightly miniaturized machine guns with corporate decals. Departing from the war theme, Beth Katleman displays doll-scale rococo theaters of murder and domestic mayhem (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* WILLIAM MERRITT CHASE, ''Modern American Landscapes, 1886-1890,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sunday). Chase (1849-1916) had a long, distinguished run as a painter, teacher and art politician. But this show zeroes in on the five-year period when, in a transitional phase between the brown, murky tones of his Munich training and his arrival at a lighter style based on French Impressionism, he painted genteel views of park landscapes in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Aside from their engaging scenic content, the 35 oils and pastels in the show are important because they are the first paintings in which an Impressionist style was used to depict American subjects. Recent examination corrected some errors about their locales. And new scholarly speculation on Chase's motives for painting them suggest that he wanted them to serve as examples of ''civilized urban landscapes'' that accorded with the European avant-garde model of modern life. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>HANS-PETER FELDMANN, 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121 (through today). Recent works by this dryly insouciant German Conceptualist include nondescript ''Photographs Taken From Hotel Room Windows While Traveling'' -- 108 of them -- and ''11 Left Shoes'' borrowed from gallery employees and displayed in a row on the floor. Works from the early 1970's include 70 snapshots depicting ''All the Clothes of a Woman,'' and ''Secret Picturebook,'' a heavy German tome with sexy pictures inserted at intervals (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RICHARD RUTKOWSKI, SoHo Black and White Photo, 470 Broome Street (entrance on Greene Street), (212) 431-7100 (through Sunday). This first solo exhibition by a cinematographer and filmmaker presents unassumingly sensitive photographs taken recently in Vietnam. A man in a Marlboro cap fixing a flat tire in a grungy garage; a dank kitchen interior; a genial middle-aged man missing an arm; children with deep and wide eyes: these are modest glimpses of a place fraught with historical and emotional reverberations (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''WITHOUT SANCTUARY: LYNCHING PHOTOGRAPHY IN AMERICA,'' New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Sunday). This exhibition scrutinizes a painful chapter in American history with heart-rending clarity: small black-and-white photographs of lynchings that took place from 1880 to 1960: mostly in the South, nearly always with African-American victims. Even more disturbing than the sight of the limp, often tortured and mutilated bodies is the sight of the crowds of white people milling about, sometimes smiling into the camera as if they were at a church picnic or state fair. The extent to which the events were condoned or at least tolerated by society is indicated by accompanying material, including facsimiles of newspapers announcing possible lynchings, and by the images often being sold as postcard mementos. The history of lynching in the United States is not unknown, but these artifacts instigate a more visceral experience, sending out shock waves that implicate ever larger chunks of American society and in many ways reach up to the present. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).</p>
