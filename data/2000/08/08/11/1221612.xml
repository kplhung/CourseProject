        <p>The Cider House Rules</p>
        <p>At an orphanage in Maine during World War II, Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine, left) performs abortions, assisted by the teenager Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), whom Dr. Larch regards as his protege until the day the boy is lured away by a dashing bomber pilot (Paul Rudd) and his dazzling blond girlfriend, Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron). In his new life Homer works in an apple orchard, has an affair with Candy and steps in to help a young woman (Erykah Badu) in an incestuous situation. A distillation of only a sliver of John Irving's novel, Lasse Hallstrom's film, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, nevertheless makes ''a gentle, beautifully acted fable about a young man's journey into the world.''</p>
        <p>1999. Miramax. $107.37: DVD, $32.99. 125 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Aug. 15.</p>
        <p>Erin Brockovich</p>
        <p>With two children to support, Erin (Julia Roberts) goes to work for an ambulance-chasing lawyer named Ed Masry (Albert Finney) and turns up evidence that a power company has been killing and maiming people with chromium emissions. Combining a feisty attitude with short skirts and tight blouses, Erin generates more attention than the average investigator, and soon Ed has the country's largest lawsuit on his docket. Early on, Steven Soderbergh's film crackles with Erin's abrasivesness. Later it becomes ''a doggedly conventional crusader-for-justice Hollywood soap opera'' (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>2000. Universal. $22.98; DVD, $26.98. 127 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Aug. 15.</p>
        <p>Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai</p>
        <p>In his deconstruction of the samurai epic and gangster movie, Jim Jarmusch composes a ruminative, bittersweet visual essay on brutality, honor and tribalism. A modern-day samurai named Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker) is pledged to serve a gangster (John Tormey), a Mafia soldier in a nameless American city. A dreamy collagist score by RZA and a witty, moving performance by Mr. Whitaker help this film about race relations in a culture unable to think clearly about the subject. ''This movie seems to suffer from a similar indecision about itself'' (Scott).</p>
        <p>1999. Artisan. $112.18; DVD, $24.98. 116 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Aug. 15.</p>
        <p>Titus</p>
        <p>Julie Taymor's film turns Shakespeare's bloody tale into a fluid time-traveling fantasia of violence and revenge that has the look of a sophisticated video game. When the Roman general Titus slays Tamora's eldest son before her eyes, she and her servant and lover (Harry Lennix) plot horrendous vengeance. Staying faithful to the original text while floating in a surreal time-collapsed world, ''Ms. Taymor discovers many unsettling contemporary resonances'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>1999. Fox. $104.16; DVD, $34.98. 160 minutes. R. Release date: Aug. 15.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS. That's Dennis Hopper under that curly coiffure, playing Pelias and providing one of the high points of an often entertaining account of Jason, the hero of Greek legend, and his quest for the golden fleece. In the NBC mini-series half the characters drown before they make much of an impression, but, Neil Genzlinger wrote in The New York Times, ''calamities, not character studies, are the main attraction here, and several ones the Argonauts blunder into are skillfully served.'' 2000. Artisan. $49.98; DVD, $19.98. 179 minutes.</p>
        <p>THE WAR ZONE. The most disturbing events in Tim Roth's film take place in a cement bunker, but the real battlefield is the rural English home where a teenager named Tom (Freddie Cunliffe) looks at his own family with helpless rage and astonishment. Preoccupied with a new baby, Tom's mother (Tilda Swinton) has no time for him, and his father (Ray Winstone) is having sex with his older sister (Lara Belmont). Treating the pain of this household as literally unspeakable, Mr. Roth favors extreme understatement in a film shot, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''with cool blue-green tones and spare, painterly precision.'' 1999. New Yorker. $89.99. 99 minutes. No rating.</p>
        <p>THE THREE MUSKETEERS. In a production from Globalstage of San Francisco, the classic by Alexandre Dumas is given a rousing performance by the Northwest Children's Theater of Portland, Ore. 1999. $27. 145 minutes. Closed captioned. Information: (888) 324-5623.</p>
