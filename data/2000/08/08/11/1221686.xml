        <p>Michael Matha was fuming as he sat outside a Firestone tire and service center yesterday in Medford, N.J..</p>
        <p>He had gone there after hearing news reports that the tires on his gold Ford Explorer had been recalled by the manufacturer because tests found defects that may have contributed to several dozen deaths.</p>
        <p>''I've heard that they're putting people off because there's a shortage of replacement tires, but I'm not taking no for an answer,'' Mr. Matha, a pharmaceuticals salesman, said. ''We have a baby, we're very safety conscious, and the car has not moved out of the driveway since the recall was announced.''</p>
        <p>But, like thousands of vehicle owners around the country, he was turned away without new tires.</p>
        <p>The announcement on Wednesday that millions of Firestone tires were being recalled sent panicked customers rushing to service centers only to be told, in many cases, that they would have to wait more than a year for replacements.</p>
        <p>The recall began in Southern and Western states and will be expanded to other regions over the next 18 months. The wait for new tires will be longest outside the Southern and Western states, where intense heat is suspected of causing treads to separate from tires. The staggered replacement plan has alarmed consumer advocates as well as vehicle owners. Several groups threatened suits over the delays, and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York State wrote federal officials voicing  his concern over the recall program.</p>
        <p>The manufacturer, Bridgestone/Firestone, defended the regional replacement plan. ''We will do everything we can to get them replaced, but we are focusing our efforts on parts of the country where there have been most of the incidents,'' said Cynthia McCafserty, a spokeswoman for Bridgestone/Firestone. The company intends to buy competitors' tires to meet replacement demand.</p>
        <p>The shortage has led to long waiting lists at service centers, from New York to the Sun Belt, and has forced many tire dealers to turn customers away at a time when families are preparing for long summer road trips.</p>
        <p>William Molloy was upset yesterday after sales representatives at a tire dealer in Garden City, N.Y., told him he would have to wait.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't make sense,'' said Mr. Molloy, 33, whose Explorer is outfitted with the tires being recalled. ''The guy told me that they are sending them all down South; it feels like a runaround. I don't want to be worried about tires blowing out on the highway.''</p>
        <p>The replacement program calls for most but not all of the replacement tires to be sent to authorized dealers in Southern and Western states, where the most serious accidents have occurred.</p>
        <p>As word of the recall spread, so did the rumors. Many vehicle owners with tires that were not a part of the recall were misinformed and showed up at dealerships yesterday.</p>
        <p>Concerned that the public was confused about which tires were being recalled, the Ford Motor Company said yesterday that it would take out full-page advertisements in many large newspapers to explain which vehicles typically had the tires as factory-installed equipment and which did not.</p>
        <p>Firestone and Ford did not identify the vehicles at their news conference on Wednesday, and this appeared to have backfired.</p>
        <p>Roberson Jeudy, 25, a New York City police officer whose Ford Expedition has Wilderness AT tires that need to be replaced, complained about how Firestone was handling the recall. ''I don't think it is fair,'' he said. ''California is not the only state they are serving.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer, New York's attorney general, agreed, saying that ''a defective product is a defective product.''</p>
        <p>''It is simply not acceptable,'' he added, ''to acknowledge a serious safety hazard, offer immediate relief for some consumers while telling other consumers to wait up to 18 months until the problem is corrected.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer sent a letter to Rosalyn G. Millman, a deputy director of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, requesting that the agency review Firestone's recall plans.</p>
        <p>But Ms. McCafserty, the Firestone spokeswoman, said the rationale behind starting in the Southern and Western states was that it appeared heat was a contributing factor to problems with the tires and all the serious accidents involving them occurred in the regions included in the first phase of the recall. The company plans to focus on getting new tires to customers based on where they are driving, even if it is not necessarily where they live, she added.</p>
        <p>The last major Firestone recall was in 1978, when the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company was fined $500,000 by federal regulators and forced to recall more than 14 million of its 500-series tires that were defective. Firestone nearly went bankrupt after that recall and was later bought by Bridgestone.</p>
        <p>About two-thirds of the tires in the current recall came new on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks made by Ford over the last decade.</p>
        <p>The model names of the recalled tires are ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT, all for 15-inch wheels, with a size designation that is P235/75R15. All such ATX and ATX II tires are being recalled, but only those Wilderness AT tires that also have a Transportation Department 10-digit designation starting with the letters VD are being recalled.</p>
        <p>Several lawsuits have been filed against Firestone, on behalf of consumers, contending that all the Wilderness tires should be replaced. Some plaintiff lawyers said yesterday that many of their suits involved the failure of tires that were not included in the recall and were being offered by Firestone as replacements for the recalled tires.</p>
        <p>Even in states like Florida, which is included in the first phase of the recall, Firestone officials acknowledged that many consumers would have to wait for replacements. Olson Tires, an authorized Firestone dealer in Boca Raton, Fla., had run out of tires by Wednesday afternoon, hours after the announcement.</p>
        <p>By yesterday afternoon, the dealer had already built up a backlog of requests for more than 35 tires. Olson told customers it was expecting shipments of replacement tires over the next couple of days, but that did little to appease angry drivers.</p>
        <p>Linda Davis, a teacher's aide from Coconut Creek, Fla., said her family had planned a weekend trip to the islands off Florida's western coast for a short vacation before the start of school but called off those plans after she left Olson with the original tires still on her Ford Explorer. ''I'm not going to do anything until this is taken care of,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Consumers around the country expressed similar concerns. ''Who wants to drive around waiting for your tires to blow?'' Gwenivere O'Neil, an actress, complained after filling out a form at a dealership in Hollywood, Calif., that did not have replacement tires available.</p>
        <p>Pablo Medina, the manager of La Cienega Firestone, an independent dealer in Los Angeles, said the recall had left many consumers concerned about all Firestone products. ''There is nothing I can do,'' Mr. Medina said, adding that he was waiting for instructions from Firestone about how to deal with the recall.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 11, 2003, Wednesday  On Thursday, June 12, 2003, The Times published an Editors' Note stating that ten additional articles by Jayson Blair, who resigned on May 1 as a reporter, were found to include misrepresentations or possible borrowed passages. An accounting of those articles was published online at nytimes.com/corrections.html. This article was among those described. The description:</p>
        <p>'Tire Recall Brings Some Panic and a Large Need for Patience'</p>
        <p>In this article about consumer reaction to the recall of Firestone tires, Mr. Blair appears to have made incorrect use of reporting he received from a freelance contributor for The Times. The lead anecdote of the article related the experience of Michael Matha, who was ostensibly sitting outside a Firestone tire and service center in Medford, N.J., waiting to get new tires for his gold Ford Explorer. Mr. Blair wrote that Mr. Matha was 'fuming' while outside the center. Both Mr. Matha and Lisa Suhay, the freelancer who interviewed him, said that was an inaccurate characterization. Mr. Matha also denied having said, 'I'm not taking no for an answer.' He also does not recall having said, The car has not moved out of the driveway since the recall was announced.' He says, I still had to drive it.'</p>
        <p>Ms. Suhay said she had interviewed Mr. Matha in front of his driveway in Medford, not outside the Firestone tire and service center. Mr. Blair described the Firestone tire and service center as being in Medford. It is in Marlton.</p>
        <p>Editors' Note:  June 12, 2003, Thursday  On May 11 The Times published an extensive report about plagiarism and fabrications by Jayson Blair before his resignation as a reporter for The Times a week earlier. The detailed account centered on articles written during and after October, when Mr. Blair began receiving national assignments. An editors' note with that account said The Times would continue spot-checking Mr. Blair's earlier articles and invited readers to report any discrepancies to retrace@nytimes.com.</p>
        <p>Ten additional articles by Mr. Blair have since been found to include misstatements or possibly borrowed passages, or quotations that have been denied by the speaker to whom they were attributed. The list is online today at nytimes.com/corrections.html, where it will remain accessible for the next week. The corrective notes will be appended to the affected articles in The Times's online databases.</p>
