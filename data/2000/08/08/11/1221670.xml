        <p>Editorial accuses Pres Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for US Senate, of 'blatantly hogging' spotlight at expense of Vice Pres Gore on virtual eve of Democratic National Convention; says their thirst for campaign money and other donations seems to be overriding both good manners and political prudence (M)</p>

        <p>Al Gore has got to be thinking ''Get the hook.'' After all, Los Angeles is a show-business town, and Democrats from across the country are heading there for what is supposed to be Vice President Gore's show. But President and Mrs. Clinton are blatantly hogging the spotlight from Saturday until next Tuesday. As has so often been the case in the Clinton administration, the thirst for campaign money and other donations seems to be overriding both good manners and political prudence. The bottom line is that Mr. Gore does not get to be the star of his own show until it is half over, and by that time the Clintons will have decamped with millions of Democratic dollars.</p>
        <p>By comparison, the last baton-passing by a two-term president was a model of grace and consideration. In 1988 Ronald Reagan zipped into New Orleans for 48 hours on a schedule adjusted to his vice president's political needs. Mr. Reagan gave one speech denouncing the Democrats and another asserting that George Bush was ready to lead, made a joint appearance with Mr. Bush at the airport and then winged off toward California.</p>

        <p>Al Gore has got to be thinking ''Get the hook.'' After all, Los Angeles is a show-business town, and Democrats from across the country are heading there for what is supposed to be Vice President Gore's show. But President and Mrs. Clinton are blatantly hogging the spotlight from Saturday until next Tuesday. As has so often been the case in the Clinton administration, the thirst for campaign money and other donations seems to be overriding both good manners and political prudence.

        <p>By comparison, the last baton-passing by a two-term president was a model of grace and consideration. In 1988 Ronald Reagan zipped into New Orleans for 48 hours on a schedule adjusted to his vice president's political needs. Mr. Reagan gave one speech denouncing the Democrats and another asserting that George Bush was ready to lead, made a joint appearance with Mr. Bush at the airport and then winged off toward California.</p>
        <p>The Clintons are heading for the Golden State too, but for them it is beach party time. A Saturday concert is supposed to raise $4 million for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign. At Barbra Streisand's place in Malibu on Sunday, Mr. Clinton is expected to pull in $10 million for his presidential library.</p>
        <p>It would be hard work to raise that kind of money later on for a facility in Arkansas, and that probably explains the president's willingness to compete with Mr. Gore for time and top billing among wealthy donors at the convention. But the president's insistent star turn misserves Mr. Gore in a way that goes beyond the financial. At this point in the campaign, the vice president needs to be seen as an independent force rather than a second banana who cannot even dictate the schedule of his own convention.</p>
        <p>This competition for attention between two supposedly best buddies creates an odd setting for Mr. Clinton's speech to the convention on Monday. Will it be a full-throated campaign speech for Mr. Gore as a leader who deserves to be president in his own right and on his own merits? Or will it be Mr. Clinton's valedictory reminder that he created an economic boom that Mr. Gore is lucky to be running on?</p>
        <p>As a historic footnote, it should be noted that Ronald Reagan wanted a third term too. But he didn't use his vice president's convention to remind everyone of that fact.</p>
