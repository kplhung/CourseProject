        <p>The Bridgestone Corporation said today that it would record a $350 million one-time accounting charge to its earnings to cover the costs of an extensive recall of problem tires produced by Firestone, its troubled United States subsidiary.</p>
        <p>The Tokyo-based parent company, which is the world's second-largest tire producer, said the extraordinary charge would reduce earnings by 26 percent, to $620 million, for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31.</p>

        <p>The Bridgestone Corporation said today that it would record a $350 million one-time accounting charge to its earnings to cover the costs of an extensive recall of problem tires produced by Firestone, its troubled United States subsidiary.</p>
        <p>The Tokyo-based parent company, which is the world's second-largest tire producer, said the extraordinary charge would reduce earnings by 26 percent, to $620 million, for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone's already depressed stock sank deeper on the announcement which was made at a hastily assembled news conference at company headquarters this afternoon. The company's shares lost 11 percent of their value today, closing at 1,849 yen, or about $17.12. Bridgestone shares have declined 27 percent since news of the tire troubles emerged on Aug. 1.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Bridgestone/Firestone, the American subsidiary, said that it was recalling 6.5 million tires that were the subject of a government investigation into 193 accidents that have caused 46 deaths in the United States since 1995. Bridgestone said that 80 percent of the accidents involved Ford Explorer sports utility vehicles outfitted with the Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>At least 50 lawsuits have been filed against Bridgestone and automakers like Ford Motor that installed the tires on their vehicles. Many of the suits cite failures of improperly inflated tires running at high speeds in hot climates.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone officials said the tire troubles were likely to cost the company far more than the $350 million reflected in the accounting charge, which does not include reserves to settle the lawsuits or cover the cost of recalls that are expected in other countries.</p>
        <p>Also today, Bridgestone Australia Ltd., which is 60 percent owned by Bridgestone, said that if required, it would replace Firestone tires in use in Australia that have been identified as the targets of the United States recall. The subsidiary said that Firestone four-wheel-drive tires were imported as on about 3,800 Ford Explorer vehicles in 1997 and that 4,500 more tires had been sold in the country as replacements.</p>
        <p>At the Tokyo news conference, Tadakazu Harada, Bridgestone's vice president, said that although the company's internal investigations so far had found no defects in the tire production process, Bridgestone's American subsidiary ''should have done more earlier to advise drivers to make sure their tires were inflated to the correct pressure.''</p>
        <p>As a result of the Firestone recall, Standard &amp; Poor's put Bridgestone and its United States subsidiary on its CreditWatch list with negative implications today, which means the company's credit rating might be downgraded.</p>
        <p>Kenichi Kitawaki, Bridgestone's public relations manager, said the parent company first learned of problems with the Firestone tires in May and that while not much concrete information was available then, the company immediately began an investigation and cooperated with United States regulators.</p>
        <p>''In the past three months, the quantity and quality of information has increased dramatically, and we must say that our current understanding of the case today is drastically different from our perception back in May,'' Mr. Kitawaki said.</p>
        <p>He said Bridgestone hoped to rebuild public confidence in its tires by undertaking the recall and improving quality control.</p>
