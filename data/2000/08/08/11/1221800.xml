        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. *denotes a highly recommended film or series. The ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 7.</p>
        <p>Now Playing</p>
        <p>*''ALICE AND MARTIN,'' starring Julliette Binoche and Alexis Loret. Directed by Andre Techine (R, 123 minutes; in french with English subtitles). Mr. Techine's sprawling, emotional love story is the kind of movie that makes you work a little. It takes time to figure out the relationships between the characters, to say nothing of their motives and feelings. But like so many of Mr. Techine's movies, ''Alice and Martin'' repays the effort. The unlikely, complicated passion between Martin, the troubled illegitimate son of a wealty industralist, and Alice, a brittle violinist, unfolds against an equally complicated and sometimes overcrowded background of family secrets and shifting domestic alliances. Ms. Binoche and Mr. Loret are superb in the title roles (A.O. Scott)</p>
        <p>*''BUTTERFLY,'' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano. Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes; in Spanish with English subtitles). This gentle, devastating film, based on short stories by the Spanish writer Manuel Rivas, tells the story of Moncho (Mr. Lozano), a sensitive young boy coming Spanish Civil War. The movie touches on the usual excitements and mysteries of childhood, but Moncho's relationship with his teacher, the proudly republican Don Gregorio, beautifully played by Mr. Fernan Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos and political complexity (Scott).</p>
        <p>*''CHICKEN RUN,'' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson adn Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (G, 86 minutes). The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Mr. Park, who also directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Mr. Lord's continuing stairical take on British modesty and balmy superiority. ''Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ''Stalag 17'' to ''Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Mr. Gibson, the voice of Rocky, the matinee-idol dlying rooster who is asked to teach the hens to fly. Finally the film shows that the hends can save themselves through the pluck of Ginger (Ms. Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal of this. It's a great eggscape from banality (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>*''CHUCK AND BUCK,'' starring Chris Weitz and Mike White. Directed by Miguel Arteta (R, 95 minutes). At the center of Mr. Arteta's funny, creepy and poignant new film is Buck, a 27-year-old man who inhabits the mental world of a preadolescent boy. As played by Mr. White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive, an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend Charlie (Mr. Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed careerist. Mr. Arteta's visual sense, Mr. White's insightful script and strong supporting performances from Mr. Weitz and his brother, Paul, as well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some time. ''Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore, magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this year (Scott).</p>
        <p>''DISNEYS 'THE KID,' '' starring Bruce Willis, Spencer Breslin, Emily Mortimer, Lily Tomlin and Jean Smart. Directed by Jon Turtletaub (PG, 101 minutes). In this cloying throwback to Disney's modest live-action comedies of old, Mr. Willis plays a smarmy image consultant humanized by his encounter with his 8-year-old self (Spencer Brelin), who arrives in Los Angeles via a toy red prop plane. By rights the movie should be dreadful, and it is thick with therapeutic cliches, but it occasionally soars to heights of not bad, thanks to strong performances from Mr. Willis, Ms. Tomlin and Ms. Smart, and to Audrey Wells's surprisingly clever script (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE,'' directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (PG-13, 79 minutes). Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, the former wife Jim Bakker, is the most American of stories, a figure of tragedy and a joke. This documentary walks us through her life, a veritable catalog of bad marriages, lost televangelist empires, squandered relationships with children and, despite it all, indomitable optimism. ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' cries out for a little more analysis of its subject. Instead, it joyfully wallows in the black-draft of her excesses. The directors are awfully quick to forgive Ms. Messner's lack of self-awareness, possibly because she has a heart as big as her hair. She was one of the first in the televangelist crowd to accept gay men because she's a survivor; it's more of a mash note than a formal documentary, and there's nothing wrong with that (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''HOLLOWMAN,'' starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue. Directed by Paul Verhoeven (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Verhoeven's sluggish new speical-effects thriller takes a tantalizing premise - the corrupting effects of invivsiblity - and drowns it in horror-movie hack work. Mr. Bacon plays an egomaniacal scientist who injects himself with a serum that disrupts his ''quantum synchroniation with the visible universe.'' You can guess the rest. He ends up pursuing his colleagues (including his ex-girlfriend, played by Ms. Shue) through a laybrinthine underground laboratory, looking, thanks to computer-generated imagery, like a plasticine anatomical model on a rampage (Scott).</p>
        <p>''NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS,'' starring Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson. Directed by Peter Segal (PG-13, 105 minutes). In this sequel, Mr. Murphy again displays enough agility to show that he deserves to be taken seriously. Parts of the film a variation on the Jekyll and Hyde story, are tremendously funny. Every single scene in which Mr. Murphy, hidden away undermillions of dollar's' worth of transformative makeup, plays all the members of the Klump faimly - all of them together in some scenes - will knock the blues right out of you. But some of the cheap laughs to which the picture stoops will give you the blues. This makes ''Nutty Professor II'' half a movie at best. The broad humor at times derails Mr. Murphy's performances, but the film provides a vehicle for him to display his read (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE PATROIT,'' starring Mel Gibson and Chris Cooper. Directred by Roland Emmerich (R, 158 minutes). A grueling Revolutionary War epic that, at more than two and a half hours, seems to take place in real time. The brutality and sentimentality are effective, though the film will leave you feeling used as you exit the theater. This sort-of prequel to Mr. Emmerich's ''Independence Day'' stars Mr. Gibson as a gentle farmer who leads the Colonies in wresting freedom from the Brits, using counterintuitive methods alarmingly similar to those of terrorism. His anguished masculinity is brandished like a musket. The film's chief asset is his relationship with the young actors playing his children; it draws on the actor's real-life feelings about his own large brood, and his work with them is stirring (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE PERFECT STORM,'' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, John C. Reilly and Diane Lane. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (PG-13, 130 minutes). Impressive but monotonously redundant special effects smother the human drama in this true story (adapted from Sebastian Junger's best-selling book) of a group of swordfishermen battling ''the strom of the century'' off Massachusetts in 1991. Mr. Clooney is the ship's glowering, enigmatic captain, and Mr. Wahlberg and Ms. Lane are the appealing lovebirds who lend the movie its stingy quotient of warmth. The early scenes, which paint a romantic portrait of the fisherman's life in Gloucester, Mass., promise a great deal, but the movie becomes water-logged once it leaves shore (Holden).</p>
        <p>''SAVING GRACE,'' starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson. Directed by Nigel Cole (R, 93 minutes). This innocuous piece of comic Anglophilia features the usual cast of lovable British eccentrics plopped down in a picturesque seaside spot, in this case a Cornish village. Ms. Bleythn is Grace, a widow whose husband committed suicide, leaving her $450,000 in debt and in danger of losing her lovely stone house. She and her resourceful gardener (Mr. Ferguson, who also wrote the screenplay) convert her greenhouse into a marijuana farm, and the resulting high jinks resemble a twee hybrid of ''The Full Monty'' and the lesser works of Cheech and Chong (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''SPACE COWBOYS,'' starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and Hames Garner. Directed by Mr. Eastwood. The second half of Mr. Eastwood's new movie is a pleasant reworking of the standard trouble-in-space movie, with Mr. Eastwood himself leading a heroic team of astronauts that also inlcudes Mr. Jones, Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Garner. But the first half, which consists of the comic, tough-old-guy interplay between these four sublime actors, is a boisterous, easygoing tribute to manhood and maturity. Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Jones are in especially fine form, as are Marcia Gay Harden, playing a NASA engineer, and James Cromwell as (once again) the villainous bureaucrat who tries to deny the old-timers their shot at celestial glory (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE TAO OF STEVE,'' starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman. Directed by Jenniphr Goodman (R, 87 minutes). The ''Steve'' in the title refers to the spiritual embodiment of cool as exemplified by Steve Mcqueen, Steve McGarrett (''Hawaii Five-0'') and Steve Austin (''The Six Million dollar Man''), a goal to which the blobby and amiable Dex aspires. In this light-as-a-marshmallow romantic comedy. Dex (Mr. Logue) has lined up quotes from Heidegger, Thomas Aquinas and ''Don Giovanni'' to rationalize his aimless pleasure-seeking in this rather aimless movie. Mr. Logue's performance as a nice-guy player - his weight doesn't keep him from scoring with the ladies - makes the movie glide. Dex has a cherub's glee over what he gets away with. The movie becomes a lot less interesting when it rolls around to the inevitable quest for a steady relationship with a girl (Ms. Goodman) whose feelings were trampled in Dex's compulsive fox-hunting. ''Tao'' can't redeem the moves to its predictable end, but is protagonist has a great time getting there. (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''WHAT LIES BENEATH,'' starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (PG-13, 130 minutes). Mr. Zemecks's film takes its time in laying out the story of high-strung Claire (Ms. Pfeiffer), who is dissolving into hysteria on a regular basis. Her daughter has just gone off to college, and Claire is still recovering from the trauma of a car accident. Then her house starts showing signs of being haunted. Her husband, Norman (Mr. Ford), is a driven research scientist with a secret. This thriller is as implausibly chiling as any ''X-Files'' episode. By the last 10 minutes, your interest will have long vanished (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''THE WIND WILL CARRY US,'' sarring Behzad Dourani. Directed by Abbas Kiarostami (noted rated, 118 minutes). The latest film by this Iranian director, widely considered one of the greatest living filmmakers, is oblique, evocative and visually stunning. Mr. Kiarostami's views of hillsides, valleys and gnarled, solitary trees seem almost other-worldly in their clarity and depth, and his story, about a morose engineer who has come to remote Kurdish village on an enigmatic mission, is as simple and mysterious as a folk tale. This is one of those rare movies that completely absorb your attention - and demand your concentration - while you're watching, and that stay in your thoughts, growing richer and more powerful, for a long time afterward (Scott).</p>
        <p>''X-MEN,'' starring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin. Driected by Bryan Singer (PG-13, 105 minutes). The long-waited arrival of Marvel Comics' do-gooder mutants is mildly fun on a couple of levels: for one, the acting duel between Mr. Stewart (as the mutant telepath Professor X, the X-Men's leader) and Ian McKellen (as the mutant nemesis Magneto, who possesses the power of supermagnetism). As these two austere hams trill their vowels at each other, you get the feeling that you really are watching members of another species in action. And Mr. Jackman scores as the two-fisted, confrontational Wolverine, a mutant with superstrength, an ability to heal all wounds and metal-alloy claws that shoot out from his knuckles. He lives to fight, a boisterous tragic hero with no complications. Otherwise, the movie is an earnest affair that is clumsy when it should be light on its feet; it takes itself even more seriously than the comic book does, though its fans may be overjoyed by that devotion (Mitchell).</p>
