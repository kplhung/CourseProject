        <p>As the oxymoronic title of this entertaining show suggests, the seven participating artists, all under 40, are interested not in nature but in nature-inspired kitsch.

        <p>Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris</p>
        <p>120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street</p>
        <p>Through Dec. 15</p>
        <p>As the oxymoronic title of this entertaining show suggests, the seven participating artists, all under 40, are interested not in nature but in nature-inspired kitsch. The show is appropriately placed in a public sculpture court -- itself a contradictory mix of the urban and the pastoral, the indoors and the out.</p>
        <p>At one end of the court stands a comical fantasyscape by Rob de Mar, a spindly tree with curved steel branches supporting little cartoonish islands -- miniature forests, bucolic parking lots, a swerving country road, a waterfall -- all coated in colored flocking. High on one wall hangs Lisa Ruyter's billboard-size painting of people lounging in the grass near Central Park Lake. Outlined and garishly colored, paint-by-numbers style, it psychedelically updates Seurat's ''Grande Jatte.''</p>
        <p>More site-specifically, Peter Gould cleverly redesigned the guard station into a three-dimensional cartoon with a bright green Formica desk top on stacked bricks set off against a small forest of green tree silhouettes. And Jason Middlebrook built into the window sills along Park Avenue a long, fake rock wall with fake flowers planted along its top.</p>
        <p>Into an existing flower box, Katrin Asbury placed a miniature red rock diorama inhabited by little hyenalike animals; in another planter, Alyson Shotz installed a grove of weird, plant-machine hybrids: tall, slender stalks made of Q-tips coated in green rubber with wheels instead of roots. And high overhead Rachel Feinstein hung a big, rococo-style papier-mache pitcher from which flowers burst as if from an exploded pinata. All of which reflects a society longing for but deliriously disconnected from the world of nature.</p>
