        <p>The Rev. Radivoje Panic has had more than his share of parishes.</p>
        <p>He lived in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, for nearly 10 years, and often gave sermons at a small church on Taslixhe hill. A witness to terror by his own Serbs, humiliated by his inability to stop the expulsion of Albanians from Pristina, he found himself expelled by them in turn.</p>
        <p>He was assigned to a church here in Kosovo Polje, a largely Serbian town a few miles southwest of Pristina, but it was badly damaged by hand grenades a year ago, despite the British troops nearby. About a month ago it was attacked again, reduced to rubble by dynamite in a large explosion, the third church destroyed in six weeks.</p>
        <p>Now Father Panic serves at the last remaining church in Kosovo Polje, the Church of St. Nicholas, which is surrounded by barbed wire and patrolled by troops. It's a bizarre life, and oddly lonely. However potent religious symbols have been for Serbian nationalism and identity, neither the Serbs nor the Albanians are especially devout after so many years of Communism. Not many Serbs come to church -- mostly the old and those who want to light candles for the dead.</p>
        <p>Even on June 28, the anniversary of the famous 1389 battle that marked the loss of this province to the Ottoman Turks for 500 years, only 11 people came here to worship. More surprising, only 70-odd came to mark the event at the early 14th-century monastery at nearby Gracanica. Services there -- under the eyes of NATO soldiers, who to some Serbs are the new Ottomans -- were conducted by Patriarch Pavle, the head of the entire Serbian Orthodox Church, and by Bishop Artemije, the church's leader in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>At least 8,000 Serbs live around Gracanica, but even on such a symbolic day, sighed the Rev. Sava Janjic, the bishop's aide and spokesman, ''you could see the empty chairs.''</p>
        <p>Father Panic, who describes himself as a simple priest, tries to see the situation as a whole. ''This is the tragedy of all of us, Serbs and Albanians,'' he said. ''There's no way to justify what happened or to improve on it. With the war and the bombing, the Albanians were pushed to leave the cities, towns and villages, and after the bombing stopped, the Serbs were pushed to leave.''</p>
        <p>He remained in Pristina throughout the war. ''To be frank,'' he said, ''I didn't see anyone personally being expelled from their apartments and houses, but I did see many Albanians leaving with their goods. I asked people why they were leaving, and they said that a lot of people were being pushed out of the apartments and houses by Serbs with guns, and that they were afraid this would happen to them.''</p>
        <p>There were a lot of armed Serbian police officers, he said, standing guard and guiding those who were leaving.</p>
        <p>And what did he do?</p>
        <p>He looked away, out the window, toward the barbed wire. ''I remember one instance, when we tried to explain to the police that they were making a mistake, that this Albanian was a good man, that we knew him. We tried at least individually to protect him. But this cop told me to get out of there, that this was not my business.''</p>
        <p>He paused again, played with a pencil. ''Individually and collectively we have responsibility,'' he said slowly. ''But you can't punish someone based on collective guilt. What is happening now is not the responsibility of all the Albanian people. I woke up one morning to see a large group of Albanians leaving Pristina. How? Why? Could someone stop that? I explained one case. Milosevic's propaganda did the worst things here and still does today.''</p>
        <p>The Serbian Orthodox Church, which broke with President Slobodan Milosevic over his failures in Bosnia, and which calls for his resignation, was clear in its attitude toward the war in Kosovo, Father Panic said. The church opposed NATO's bombing, but it also opposed the wrong done to Kosovo's Albanians, the murders and expulsions.</p>
        <p>Father Sava, the bishop's aide, who often comes here to get a better Internet connection on the church's telephone, says that the church should have broken with Mr. Milosevic sooner, and that many priests became too caught up in the nationalist fervor over Bosnia, with some of them photographed atop advancing tanks. ''And too many others were silent,'' Father Sava said.</p>
        <p>He and Bishop Artemije are regarded as traitors by Belgrade -- and by some Kosovo Serbs -- for working politically with Washington and the United Nations civilian leader here, Bernard Kouchner, to try to increase security for Serbs and allow more of them to return. The church leadership has also expressed regret and sorrow for Serbian actions here.</p>
        <p>But its apologies to Albanians, and its call for tolerance and forgiveness, ring hollow in Albanian ears, and many Serbs here still seem unable to acknowledge what was done in their name or even by their neighbors.</p>
        <p>''The war happened, and there was a lot of anger on both sides,'' Father Panic said. ''Evil things happened to ordinary Albanians, too, that's the tragedy. But the peace has been signed. What happened, happened. There were 60,000 Serbs in Pristina,  and now there are 238. But life must go on. And today I'm occupied mostly with the problems of simple people, who did no evil to anyone. The ones who did the evil have left.''</p>
        <p>After the war last summer, Father Panic's apartment was robbed many times and his car stolen. ''There was no longer any way for me to live in Pristina,'' he said. ''So in September, I left Pristina forever and came here.''</p>
        <p>On Taslixhe hill in Pristina, the church where Father Panic once preached, in the once-mixed neighborhood where he once lived, is guarded around the clock by the Royal Fusiliers, with their trademark feathers of red and white shooting out of their caps. The church is fine, but there are few Serbs left to use it; the soldiers, who keep watch from a sandbag shelter 24 hours a day, in all weather, are bored to tears. But the minute they leave, they know, the church will be vandalized and destroyed, as some 80 others have been.</p>
        <p>They have two dogs, mongrels, that keep them company. One they have named NATO and the other Unmik, the acronym for the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, which runs civilian life here. ''NATO barks at all the cars,'' a soldier said, laughing. ''And Unmik sleeps.''</p>
