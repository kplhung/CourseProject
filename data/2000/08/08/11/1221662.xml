        <p>Screech. Slam. Ooh. Ahh.</p>
        <p>Edward F. Boyd and his family scarcely notice the noise anymore. They know the routine so well. First, there is the sudden glow of the brake lights on the vehicles heading past their 120-acre farm on a normally quiet back road in rural Sullivan County.

        <p>Screech. Slam. Ooh. Ahh.</p>
        <p>Edward F. Boyd and his family scarcely notice the noise anymore. They know the routine so well. First, there is the sudden glow of the brake lights on the vehicles heading past their 120-acre farm on a normally quiet back road in rural Sullivan County. Then comes the whine of the brakes and the thump of car doors slamming. Inevitably, a knot of curious visitors gathers at the pasture fence near the 200-year-old house.</p>
        <p>''A lot of them take out cameras,'' said Mr. Boyd, ''because they've never seen an alpaca before.''</p>
        <p>He was referring to the 80 quizzical, friendly looking, big-eyed creatures eyeing him meditatively on a recent afternoon, all of them sporting improbably long eyelashes and goofy topknots. Each resembled nothing so much as a teddy-bear-ish Bambi as drawn by Dr. Seuss.</p>
        <p>Until very recently the alpaca was an exotic sight at county fairs and petting zoos in the metropolitan region. And the animals were profoundly unknown way out there in rustic crevices like Mr. Boyd's 120-acre former dairy spread, half a mile from what was once the site of the original Woodstock festival.</p>
        <p>For a tiny but growing number of upstate farmers and entrepreneurs, however, these gentle, adaptable creatures are becoming not just a curiosity but a way of life: an avocation, a passionate cause and, more importantly, a profit center.</p>
        <p>Officials in Sullivan County and the region see the alpaca farms, should their numbers grow,  not only as a support to the local economy, but as an alternative to the exurban encroachment that is implacably transforming picturesque dairy farms into split-level tracts. ''Alpacas are well suited to the land here,'' said Allan C. Scott, supervisor of the Town of Bethel, the largest in the county. ''It's already a good thing for our economy, and I'm sure that raising alpacas could be an economic option for others in Sullivan County.''</p>
        <p>One of those others is Maria Herlinda Bravo, an entrepreneur who has established a herd of 340 alpacas on a 48-acre farm in Callicoon, N.Y., six miles northwest of Mr. Boyd.</p>
        <p>''Alpacas thrive in the warm days and cool nights here,'' said Ms. Bravo, a former grocery-chain vice president, who in 1999 made her farm the headquarters of a vertically integrated international alpaca operation. She breeds the animals and shears the luxurious fleece for her fashion business, selling expensive scarves, sweaters, blankets and blouses through a catalog and on the Internet, under the name of Quintessence and Company.</p>
        <p>Apart from Mr. Boyd and Ms. Bravo, alpaca herds have recently been established in Catskill, New Kingston and Walton. There are other New York herds in Hancock and Rome, and alpacas are being raised on Long Island and in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyd's son Brandon is president of the Mid-Atlantic Alpaca Association, which counts as its members 100 of the 140 alpaca owners in seven mid-Atlantic states (they are given to flaunting vehicle bumper stickers proclaiming ''ALPACAS -- HAVE YOU HERD?'').</p>
        <p>But still: alpacas?</p>
        <p>While some raise the animals as pets, the real draw is the silky, durable, water-resistant and highly insulative alpaca fleece, which has long been prized as the raw material for luxurious fabric.</p>
        <p>Breeders say that depending on the color and the quality, fleece sells for $2 to $8 per ounce in the United States, primarily to artisanal weavers and knitters. Each animal produces five to eight pounds of fleece per year, enough for several sweaters.</p>
        <p>While it can be lucrative to sell, alpaca can be even more lucrative to weave: a man's sweater can be made out of one pound of yarn worth about $40; it costs $100 in labor to weave, and can be sold for $400.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Boyd and other herd owners breed alpacas for more than fleece: females sell for $12,500 to $40,000, and herd sires have fetched as much as $165,000. Owners command stud fees of $2,000 to $5,000 for their prize bulls.</p>
        <p>These days 99 percent of the world's three million alpacas graze in the mountains of Bolivia, Chile and Peru. But in recent years, herds have been established in Canada, Australia, Japan, Britain, Israel, Italy and other countries.</p>
        <p>In the United States, alpacas are being raised in every state, and the nation's alpaca herd is growing by about 22 percent a year, according to the Alpaca Registry in Kalispell, Mont. By July 31, there were 29,856 registered alpacas, up 2,145 percent over 1990, when there were 1,330. The number of owners has grown from 146, in 1991, to 2,919.</p>
        <p>''We expect the number to double in another five years,'' said Ken Hobert, business manager of the Alpaca Owners and Breeders Association in Estes Park, Colo., which has 1,950 members. ''We get 1,000 inquiries a month from people who want to know more about owning alpacas,'' he  said of the registry's Web site, www.alpacainfo.com.</p>
        <p>He said the scarcity of alpacas is based on their slow rate of reproduction, since females usually deliver one baby, called a cria, per year. Importing alpacas from South America is difficult and expensive, given quarantine restrictions, and the Alpaca Registry has been closed to newly imported alpacas since Dec. 31, 1998. Unregistered alpacas ''have minimal breeding value, and are difficult to sell,'' Mr. Boyd said.</p>
        <p>Eager to show off the superiority of their fleece, alpaca worshipers proffer research showing that alpaca fibers are stronger, lighter, warmer and softer than sheep's wool. Studies show that the semi-hollow alpaca fibers are finer than Angora rabbit fleece, mohair (from Angora goats) and cashmere goat fleece.</p>
        <p>And unlike merino (sheep's wool), alpaca fleece is lanolin-free, and sold, therefore, to those who are allergic to wool.</p>
        <p>Beyond this, breeders say alpacas are, in livestock patois, easy keepers, requiring minimal food, water, care and shelter, thanks to the extremes of heat and cold their ancestors endured in the Andes. They live 15 to 25 years and can weigh 150 to 175 pounds.</p>
        <p>They are placid, have no incisors, horns, hooves or claws, and ''they don't bite and they rarely kick, and when they do, they don't hurt each other -- because they have soft pads on their feet,'' said Mr. Boyd's farm manager, Jair Trujillo. ''They don't cut up the pasture, either.''</p>
        <p>For these and other reasons, alpaca owners reject comparisons with the ostrich-farm scramble of the 1980's, when speculators expected windfall profits from the supposedly exploding ostrich market only to find that it was more of a novelty boomlet. ''Ostriches are mean, dangerous and dirty,'' contended Mr. Boyd, ''and they are nowhere as easy to handle as alpacas.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bravo estimates that, given the slow alpaca reproductive rate, ''it will take a long time to drive the price of breeding stock down.''</p>
        <p>She has placed a big bet on Sullivan County by putting in new buildings and paddocks to house her high-tech computer-monitored alpaca business, which employs six full-time workers, and features a two-story barn-cum-office-cum-laboratory equipped with ultrasound devices to monitor gestating alpaca females.</p>
        <p>The hope for stability in alpaca prices is an important consideration in Sullivan County, where, because of low milk prices, more farms ''are being lost every year,'' said Mr. Scott, a director of the Sullivan County Partnership, a consortium of organizations working to develop the county's economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyd, an alpaca proselytizer, said he welcomed competition. ''There is plenty of room for more,'' said Mr. Boyd, a retired marketing manager for the Pepsi-Cola Company and American Home Products Corporation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyd, 86, bought the farm in 1966, a decade after it supported dairy cows, ''but I always wanted to use the property productively,'' he said. He finally got his wish in 1994 after seeing a televised report about an alpaca herd in Santa Fe, N.M. ''I knew how to spell alpaca but didn't know any more than that.''</p>
        <p>He added, laughing, ''Some people thought I had a soft cranium, but I saw the potential from the start.'' He suggested the alpaca avocation to his wife and four grown children. ''After Dad suggested we buy them, we just looked at each other,'' recalled his 44-year-old son, Brandon, an entertainment lawyer in Manhattan. ''Then we said: 'What is this? Can you eat them? Do they pull a plow?' Finally we thought, 'Maybe it will help to keep Dad busy.' ''</p>
        <p>In 1994 the senior Mr. Boyd bought his first three animals for $55,500, soon bought seven more, and found himself the proprietor of the Double E Alpaca Farm (the E's represent Ed Boyd and his wife, Edith).</p>
        <p>As his herd increased, he began selling fleece to local spinners, and soon was selling animals and obtaining stud fees. ''I started with a five-year plan, to make money, and we made it,'' said Mr. Boyd, adding that his alpacas were profitable for the first time in 1999, earning $50,000.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Brandon Boyd said that he was converted. ''There was just something about them that drew me in,'' he said. As he spoke, he stood near his father in the venerable dairy barn, where a throng of alpacas made the sound called ''humming'': a soothing ululation that sounds something like a happy kazoo.</p>
        <p>''They are such gentle animals,'' Brandon said. ''All I can say is that I've really become very gung-ho about alpacas.''</p>
