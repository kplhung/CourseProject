        <p>What can possibly be left to say about Beethoven at this late date? A great deal, it must be hoped, for the Bard Music Festival is devoting the next two weekends and a third in October to the composer, and these are truly talkative affairs.</p>
        <p>It used to be, a quarter-century ago, that you had a biography (the classic ''Thayer's Life of Beethoven,'' perhaps, as revised and edited by Elliot Forbes) and an LP set of the symphonies (say, Herbert von Karajan's version from the early 60's with the Berlin Philharmonic), and you thought you had a fix on the composer. Now the book and CD shelves groan, yet Beethoven seems to grow only more mysterious and fragmented, both in his personage and in his meanings for our time.

        <p>What can possibly be left to say about Beethoven at this late date? A great deal, it must be hoped, for the Bard Music Festival is devoting the next two weekends and a third in October to the composer, and these are truly talkative affairs.</p>
        <p>It used to be, a quarter-century ago, that you had a biography (the classic ''Thayer's Life of Beethoven,'' perhaps, as revised and edited by Elliot Forbes) and an LP set of the symphonies (say, Herbert von Karajan's version from the early 60's with the Berlin Philharmonic), and you thought you had a fix on the composer. Now the book and CD shelves groan, yet Beethoven seems to grow only more mysterious and fragmented, both in his personage and in his meanings for our time. He has, as academics like to say, been ''problematized.''</p>
        <p>Maynard Solomon adopted techniques of psychobiography in his 1977 book ''Beethoven.'' Alessandra Comini explored the myths about the composer in her 1987 book ''The Changing Image of Beethoven.'' Roger Norrington and the London Classical Players applied period performance practice to recordings of the symphonies in the late 80's. Scott Burnham examined what Beethoven's music meant to early listeners and how those meanings have endured in his 1995 book ''Beethoven Hero.''</p>
        <p>''This festival comes after 10 or 15 years of very provocative Beethoven scholarship,'' Leon Botstein, the founding artistic director of the festival, said recently. ''There was a whole period of scholarship having to with the creative process, which Lewis Lockwood, Robert Winter and other people were involved with. Then there was another generation that started with feminist scholarship, and then with the 'deconstruction' of the titanic figure, by Scott Burnham and Elisabeth Eleonore Bauer.'' Mr. Solomon, Mr. Burnham, Mr. Lockwood and Ms. Bauer are all to speak or participate in symposiums at the festival.</p>
        <p>One result of such explorations has been a radical revision of the notion of Beethoven as an Olympian figure removed from daily life in his creation, writing quintessentially absolute music, almost wholly abstract in its meanings. Beethoven is now thought to have been deeply concerned in his music with description, narrative, rhetoric, prosody, even philosophy.</p>
        <p>The Composer's World</p>
        <p>Mr. Botstein pointed to the significance of certain keys in the Missa Solemnis: G, ''sol'' in solfege, to represent the sun in ''Et resurrexit''; D, ''re,'' for kingly or regal music. Such matters, he suggested, are of more than merely intellectual concern, for they affect performance practice no less surely than the continuing debate over Beethoven's metronome markings does. (Whether because of faulty early metronomes, as was long thought, or because of the misreading of the composer's intentions over the years, those markings in many cases indicate tempos faster than those we are used to.)</p>
        <p>''Some current scholars think Beethoven is long gone and buried,'' Mr. Botstein said. ''That's an interesting question for the festival. Is he? Has he finally receded into history? Maybe this stuff belongs on the shelf, another trophy on the shelf of dead classical music. Well, we'll find out.''</p>
        <p>As part of its scholarly apparatus, the Bard festival publishes a valuable book in connection with each outing, and this year's, ''Beethoven and His World'' (Princeton University Press), shows a remarkable variety of current academic concerns having to do with Beethoven. It is edited by Michael P. Steinberg, a historian at Cornell University associated with the festival from the start, who is to moderate a symposium next Friday, and Mr. Burnham, a musicologist at Princeton.</p>
        <p>One of the more compelling essays is by Ms. Comini, ''The Visual Beethoven: Whence, Why and Whither the Scowl?'' The scowl has been a consistent trait in depictions of Beethoven, and it neatly fits what we think we know of him: a fierce egalitarian forced to mingle with aristocrats and curry favor (and income) from them; an instinctive humanist made misanthropic by deafness; a plaything of fate, exquisitely tortured yet opting for defiance over despair.</p>
        <p>In fact, the scowl may be infinitely more mundane in its origins. Although apprehensive about the process, Beethoven allowed a plaster mask to be cast from his face in 1812. The stifling, unpleasant procedure included inserting quills in his nostrils to allow him to breathe. The resulting ''life mask'' has often been misidentified as the death mask, in which the mouth merely droops. ''It exactly replicates not only Beethoven's living face, complete with pock marks (possibly from smallpox) and facial scars but also his acute physical discomfort,'' Ms. Comini writes, ''for this is what the contracted brow and firmly clamped 'scowling' mouth register.''</p>
        <p>Posterity read it, and wanted it, otherwise. When Ludwig Rellstab, a critic from Berlin, visited Beethoven in Vienna in 1825, he found the reality anticlimactic: ''There was nothing expressing that brusqueness, that tempestuous, unshackled quality which has been lent his physiognomy in order to bring it into conformity with his works.''</p>
        <p>Also fascinating is the essay ''Beethoven and Masculinity,'' by Sanna Pederson, who is to take part in the festival. The introduction of sexual interpretations into discussions of classical music has often seemed far-fetched and resulted in ridicule for practitioners of the ''new musicology.'' But Ms. Pederson's measured discussion provides an illuminating analysis of the ways in which Beethoven's music and personality, while embodying the French revolutionary ideals of liberty and fraternity, may have glossed over certain matters of equality.</p>
        <p>''The reason why Beethoven is assumed to be the most masculine of composers,'' she writes, ''is that what he and his music stand for is precisely the same ideology that tries to attain universal society in theory while maintaining male domination in practice.''</p>
        <p>The book is filled with other interesting and delightful tidbits, including the information, in Mr. Lockwood's ''Beethoven, Florestan and the Varieties of Heroism,'' that Beethoven once contemplated writing an opera called ''The Arrival of the Pennsylvanians in America.'' (And he thought he had problems with ''Fidelio''!)</p>
        <p>Great Works and More</p>
        <p>The Bard Music Festival began on the campus of Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., in 1990, with each season centering on a different composer. In his other conductorial activities, specifically with the American Symphony Orchestra in New York, Mr. Botstein tends to seek out the unknown, turning up the odd masterpiece along with the predictable preponderance of dross.</p>
        <p>One of his great triumphs with the American Symphony was a steamy performance of Schnittke's ''Faust Cantata,'' with the soprano Joyce Castle in 1994. His latest discovery for the future is ''Des Jona Sendung'' (''Jonah's Mission''), an oratorio by Rudolf Tobias, an Estonian composer, which was recommended by Mr. Botstein's conductorial colleague Paavo Jarvi. (It has, like seemingly every other work ever composed, been recorded by Mr. Jarvi's father, Neeme Jarvi.)</p>
        <p>Six of the Bard festivals, on the other hand, have been devoted to composers from the central Germanic tradition: Brahms, Mendelssohn, Strauss, Schumann, Haydn and, last year, Schoenberg. The others focused on Dvorak, Bartok, Ives and Tchaikovsky. The concept here is different: to dig deep into the repertories of familiar masters, locating unusual and neglected works that help put the masterpieces in context. To broaden that context, works of other, often unfamiliar composers are brought to bear as well.</p>
        <p>Haydn was an exception, with only his own works presented, and Beethoven is almost another, with just one program of works by his teachers. The layout is basically chronological, with genres freely mixed. ''It seemed the least intrusive way to raise questions about Beethoven without imposing a solution,'' Mr. Botstein said.</p>
        <p>Great works are here, to be sure: the Fourth Piano Concerto and the ''Pastoral'' Symphony tomorrow and the Seventh Symphony and the Missa Solemnis next weekend. But there are also works far off the beaten path, like the ''Cantata on the Death of the Emperor Joseph II'' tomorrow. Next weekend, Mr. Botstein embraces the quixotic task of reclaiming ''Wellington's Victory,'' a work that gets no respect these days but, Mr. Botstein argues, deserves some.</p>
        <p>''Beethoven presents an interesting challenge,'' he said. ''With Haydn, we knew from the outset that no matter how deep we dug into the drawer, the music would all be great. He couldn't write bad music, somehow. But with a lot of Beethoven, we simply can't be sure. We've been very selective about the canon, and we've always had the impression that there was a big break between the very good and everything else. I'm not entirely sure that's the case.''</p>
        <p>Farewell to the Tent</p>
        <p>Mr. Botstein was only too happy to discuss plans for future festivals because they involve a new, 900-seat performing arts center on the Bard College campus, designed by Frank Gehry and scheduled to open in 2003. Now most of the smaller programs are presented in a small auditorium and the orchestral concerts take place in a tent, with acoustics little more than decent.</p>
        <p>''The larger concerts are pretty soggy,'' Mr. Botstein said. ''And I have no romance with alfresco performance.''</p>
        <p>The stage of the new hall is designed to accommodate opera, and that feature, in Mr. Botstein's mind, opens the way not only to Verdi in 2003 but also to Smetana in 2004. He has wanted to do Smetana ever since the Dvorak outing in 1993, he said, but he felt that it was necessary to include opera (and not just a concert performance, as was done with Tchaikovsky's ''Maid of Orleans'' in 1998).</p>
        <p>For Verdi and possibly other festivals in the future, Mr. Botstein plans to add another weekend or so to the schedule to accommodate a run of big works: not only ''Don Carlos,'' in the four-act version in French, and ''Falstaff,'' but also the plays on which they were based, by Schiller and Shakespeare (''The Merry Wives of Windsor''). Mr. Gehry is to provide stage designs for ''Don Carlos,'' the opera and the play.</p>
        <p>Other plans include, someday, an additional week in the fall, at Bard College during foliage season, to complement the annual weekend at Lincoln Center. Mr. Botstein also has hopes of instituting some sort of training center -- whether for musicians or for scholars he is not sure -- to take full advantage of the talent assembled each year.</p>
        <p>Next year, meanwhile, Debussy gets the usual treatment. When it emerged that the new hall would not be ready for 2002, as originally hoped, plans were shifted ahead, leaving 2002 vacant, as it remains at the moment. Bach, who was considered for this year, the 250th anniversary of his death, is said to lie a few years down the road.</p>
        <p>The festival gives every appearance of thriving. And audiences, Mr. Botstein said, continue to grow steadily despite the varying popularity of the composers represented.</p>
        <p>''I think we struck a nerve generally in the classical music world with the Bard festival and with the American Symphony concerts,'' he said, ''by curating concerts, by treating the public seriously in a way that is not forbidding and by making music not a dead object behind glass, but a subject of living controversy and reinterpretation on the part of the audience as well as the performers. People walk out of the concert hall arguing. We actually have influenced the way programming is thought about, and the relationship between our role as museum keepers and the current culture.''</p>
        <p>''Influenced'' does not claim too much, certainly. Mr. Botstein and his forces have not been alone in bringing about this change, in bringing music out of its ivory tower and putting it in contact with the intellectual currents of the here and now. But they have indeed played a crucial part. They have helped create a climate in which, as the editors write in the festival book, ''music scholars are currently more eager to engage questions of cultural history than cultural historians are to think about music.'' Now if they could just wake up the cultural historians.</p>
