        <p>As the rain clattered on his aluminum roof, Akierou Awe sat in a gloomy corner of his mud-brick house and spoke softly of the fuel-pipeline explosion that killed three of his sons last month, not far from his village in this oil-soaked corner of Africa.</p>
        <p>Fuel had been leaking from the pipeline at a spot deep in the bush, near a forest of rubber trees. Villagers had been scooping it up with jerrycans, washbasins and plastic bottles that they carried away in wheelbarrows, hoping to resell it for a few pennies above the official rate of 21 cents a quart.</p>
        <p>Then perhaps a wheelbarrow knocked against another, causing a spark.</p>
        <p>The explosion shook Mr. Awe's house early on the morning of July 10. The fire spread along a mile-long stretch of the pipeline, killing more than 300 people, including his sons Kingsley, 23; Tuesday, 22, and Gift, 20, all of whom tapped rubber trees for a living.</p>
        <p>''Even as you see me now, I am no longer a full human being,'' Mr. Awe, 65, a retired civil servant, said, so softly that the rain nearly drowned out his words. ''Gift attended secondary school and he was supposed to finish this year.'' A fourth son, Hope, 20, had been with his brothers but was not killed. Hope was still in the hospital, but his father did not know whether he would survive.</p>
        <p>The Niger Delta of Nigeria, one of the world's top oil producers, has been the center of violent despair for years. A swampy patch of land, laced by tributaries of West Africa's great Niger River, it yields almost all of Nigeria's two million barrels a day of crude, most of which ends up at gas stations in the United States.</p>
        <p>But because of this country's complicated history of ethnic politics, delta residents have remained stunningly and desperately poor. The residents are members of ethnic minorities; partly out of fear that Nigeria might break up one day, the Hausa-speaking northern generals who have ruled most of the time since independence have kept the oil-rich delta poor and weak.</p>
        <p>And recently, in gruesome displays of that poverty, hundreds have been burned to death in at least five explosions as they tried to scoop up leaking fuel.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more than any other country on the continent, Nigeria -- where one in six Africans live -- has focused attention on the problematic role of natural resources, which have enriched the African elite and Western businesses but slowed development.</p>
        <p>Nigeria is the nightmare that loomed before World Bank officials who recently approved a $3.7 billion oil pipeline for Chad; it is a warning for tiny Equatorial Guinea, where oil started gushing four years ago.</p>
        <p>Pipelines have exploded in many poor nations. The biggest explosions since the early 1980's occurred in 1984 in Brazil, where 508 were killed; in 1994 in Egypt, where there were 529 deaths; and in 1998 in Cameroon, where at 220 died.</p>
        <p>But Nigeria leads by a wide margin: in the last two years, official figures indicate, more than 2,000 women, men and children have died in pipeline explosions. Many believe that the real figure is even higher.</p>
        <p>What is more, while explosions elsewhere result from accidents, here the source is sabotage. Organized rings of thieves with knowledge of the pipelines, allied with corrupt government and military officials, are believed to siphon huge quantities of fuel with sophisticated equipment and trucks.</p>
        <p>The leaks eventually attract jerrycan-grasping villagers, invariably the ones who end up being killed.</p>
        <p>''Because of the level of grinding poverty in the Niger Delta, when there are these leaks, people see it as an opportunity to make some money despite the dangers,'' said Doifie Ola, director of Environmental Rights Action, a Lagos-based organization that monitors explosions. ''Similar incidents are likely to keep recurring if nothing concrete is done.''</p>
        <p>Immediately after assuming power in May 1999, President Olusegun Obasanjo visited the delta. He raised great hopes among its seven million inhabitants, but little has been accomplished. A Niger Delta development bill has yet to become law.</p>
        <p>In fact the most notable government action was the military's destruction of a town called Odi last November after residents killed 12 police officers. President Obasanjo later expressed regret for the attack on Odi, which many see as the single most startling violation of human rights during his term.</p>
        <p>Port Harcourt, one of the two oil centers in the delta, had tentatively been on the itinerary of President Clinton, who is to visit Nigeria this month. But it is now unlikely he will come to the delta; he will very likely spend most of his visit in the capital, Abuja.</p>
        <p>The delta is growing increasingly restive. Early this month, youths held hostage 165 workers associated with Shell, the biggest oil exporter, eventually releasing them. And vandalism of oil pipelines has risen sharply.</p>
        <p>The targets are usually not the multinationals' pipelines, which carry crude oil for export, but lines connected to government-owned refineries that process crude in the delta and ship easy-to-resell gasoline or kerosene through a 3,250-mile network crisscrossing Nigeria.</p>
        <p>The country's four oil refineries have long been the source of corruption: Gen. Sani Abacha, the former dictator, allowed them to deteriorate so severely that Nigeria found itself in the absurd position of importing gasoline -- through the general's middlemen -- from non-oil-producing nations.</p>
        <p>Since General Abacha's death in June 1998, the refineries have been repaired, making the delivery network the target of thieves who siphon out fuel.</p>
        <p>Some results have been grim. In October 1998, 1,082 people were killed, by official tally, in a huge explosion in Jesse, not far from here. A pipeline connected to a refinery in Warri, the second oil center of the delta, was punctured.</p>
        <p>In 1999 government pipelines were sabotaged 497 times, according the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, which owns and operates the pipeline network. In the first three months of this year, the number had already reached 200.</p>
        <p>In the first five months, $20 million was lost in stolen fuel and damage done to pipelines, the petroleum corporation estimates.</p>
        <p>The state-run corporation fired some of its workers after villagers reported their involvement in the siphoning: they had employed soldiers to guard tankers that were driven along the pipelines to collect the fuel.</p>
        <p>Jackson Gaius-Obaseki, managing director of the oil corporation, acknowledged the collusion at a news conference in Warri after visiting victims of the latest explosion, and said more dismissals were planned.</p>
        <p>At another news conference, a corporation spokesman, Ndu Ughamadu, said that although villagers had been scooping up the fuel, they could not have been the ones to puncture it.</p>
        <p>''Our engineers have told us that vandalization of oil pipelines takes a scientific process which ordinary villagers can't engage in,'' he said. ''There must be well-placed people that have links with this pipeline vandalization. Where they have located a pipeline, they will perforate holes and quietly they will lay pipelines for up to one kilometer, where they siphon the fuel at will.''</p>
        <p>To reach the pipeline from here in Oviri-Court, one must quit a dirt road and hike a half-mile into the bush. Wooden planks remain on the muddy stretches to allow access to vehicles -- evidence, villagers said, that an organized ring had come here with a truck and equipment. A big hole had been dug, exposing the pipeline, which now lay underwater.</p>
        <p>The explosion charred the trees in the area; their leafless black skeletons rise out of darkened water. The 300 bodies have been carried away. But the tools of the dead lay scattered around: washbasins, countless plastic bottles, jerrycans, a scorched bicycle, two wheelbarrows.</p>
        <p>Adeje, a nearby village with no electricity, no tap water and no paved road, is typical of the Niger Delta -- in fact better off than villages accessible only by boat.</p>
        <p>Timothy Oghoro, a community leader in his 70's, was one of many villagers who said they had reported the leaking pipeline to the local authorities.</p>
        <p>But nothing had been done, Mr. Oghoro said, because the vandals were well connected and had siphoned the fuel under military escort.</p>
        <p>''The police are not here to protect us,'' Mr. Oghoro said. ''If the government wanted to protect us, they would employ people to man the pipeline. No one will go there.''</p>
        <p>Another local leader, David Okomore, 45, said he and the village chief, Benson Egberebo, 65, once videotaped a leaking pipeline.</p>
        <p>''The soldiers pounced on us,'' he said. ''The chief was taken to the police station and interrogated.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Okomore, one of the few college-educated men in the village, said two of his cousins, women aged 50 and 19, had been killed in the explosion. He had to identify their bodies, which were buried in a mass grave. ''Because they were poor and uneducated,'' he said, ''they were scooping the fuel.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Okomore foresees repercussions beyond the deaths: ''Because of the explosion and the destruction, the farms we have won't produce anymore -- even the river has been polluted. There will be even less for the people to do here.''</p>
        <p>Surely, he added, the destruction will make more people hopeless. More will scoop for fuel. He is not counting on the government.</p>
        <p>''When we ask for compensation,'' he said, ''they harass us with soldiers. There's nothing we can do. We only live by the mercy of God now.''</p>
