        <p>Until yesterday, Poland's presidential election on Oct. 8 seemed unlikely to turn on agriculture, pensions or any other subject Poles seriously worry about.

Under a 1998 law, signed by President Aleksander Kwasniewski, informers who do not come clean about their past cannot hold high government posts -- and ''Alek'' was alleged to be President Kwasniewski himself, an overwhelming favorite to win re-election if allowed to run.

        <p>Until yesterday, Poland's presidential election on Oct. 8 seemed unlikely to turn on agriculture, pensions or any other subject Poles seriously worry about. The most important issue was the identity of ''Alek'' and ''Bolek'' -- code names belonging to supposed domestic spies of 15 and 30 years ago, culled from deep in the secret police archives. Under a 1998 law, signed by President Aleksander Kwasniewski, informers who do not come clean about their past cannot hold high government posts -- and ''Alek'' was alleged to be President Kwasniewski himself, an overwhelming favorite to win re-election if allowed to run. ''Bolek,'' moreover, is allegedly one of his competitors and the hero of Poland's liberation from Communism, former president Lech Walesa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kwasniewski was cleared yesterday. A special court may rule today on the fate of Mr. Walesa. As Poland is learning from these cases, screening laws, which are designed to strengthen democracy, do not always do so. They lend themselves to manipulation by unscrupulous politicians. What has happened in Poland now may be a tale not of Communist-era spying, but of present-day political intrigue.</p>
        <p>In 1997 Poland decided to emulate the Czech Republic and pass a law to keep former secret police agents out of government. In Poland, officials must declare whether they were informers. Only those found to be lying lose their jobs. Mr. Kwasniewski and Mr. Walesa said they were not spies, and so risked losing the right to run.</p>
        <p>Accusations of spying have brought down two recent governments. In January 1996, Prime Minister Jozef Olesky resigned after being accused of spying for the K.G.B.  Three months later, prosecutors dropped the charges after finding that the evidence was flawed. In 1992, by contrast, it was the accusers who fell. Antoni Macierewicz, the interior minister of a right-wing government, released a list of 64 people he said the secret police files named as spies -- among them the prime minister's most important political adversaries, including then-President Walesa.  A parliamentary committee later concluded that only 6 of the 64 had signed any agreement to collaborate -- Mr. Walesa not among them. The Government fell. But Mr. Macierewicz is one of Mr. Walesa's accusers today.</p>
        <p>The accusation that Lech Walesa was a paid informant illustrates the absurdity of screening laws. Mr. Walesa has long admitted that in 1970 he signed some documents he was not particularly proud of. But he says he never promised collaboration and never informed.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Walesa, who specialized in telling people what they wanted to hear, was perfectly capable of signing anything and then behaving as he pleased. His calculated duplicity was so effective that at the height of the Solidarity movement, top Communist leaders were convinced he could be won over. The strategy served him -- and the foes of Communism -- well.</p>
        <p>The documents could also be fakes. Secret police officials often cooked up files to blackmail dissidents. Mr. Walesa says he saw versions of the same documents in 1992, and they have been altered to be more incriminating now.</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Kwasniewski had been an informer, that would be irrelevant today. He presided over Poland's accession to NATO. Poland has been the economic success story of the former East Bloc. Despite the allegations of spying, he remained the choice of a majority of voters. Throwing him off the ballot would be  undemocratic.</p>
        <p>The timing of the accusations may be no accident. In March 1999, investigators requested President Kwasniewski's file from Poland's current security service. Poland's parliamentary government is led by a center-right party opposed to both Mr. Kwasniewski and Mr. Walesa. But the file was presented to the court only now, shortly before the election.</p>
        <p>The proper way for Poland, and every other nation, to deal with its secret police files is to open them in a depoliticized manner. The files should go to an independent historical commission. Individuals should be able to see their own files, as in Germany. Access to their files has enabled the victims there to understand the havoc wreaked on their lives, to find out which of their friends did not spy, and to begin dialogues with those ''friends'' and colleagues who did -- dialogues that have turned into important national conversations about the nature of collaboration.</p>
        <p>Poland, which is planning to open its files to individuals next year, needs this kind of discussion as well.  It should abandon the current screening law, which can be easily used for political attacks based on questionable evidence.</p>
