        <p>''Twice Born,'' a 43-minute cinematic valentine about his life, had just concluded when Muhammad Ali rose slowly from his seat to proclaim, ''Time for a comeback.''</p>
        <p>Marguerite Williams gestured at her son-in-law from her seat inside the theater at the Museum of Television and Radio in Manhattan on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>''Did you see that look of devilment in his eyes?'' said Williams, whose daughter, Lonnie, married Ali in 1986. ''He's always had that.''</p>
        <p>That look is all over ''Twice Born,'' including in a photo of Lonnie Williams's first meeting with Ali on the Clay family porch in Louisville, Ky., where the shy 5 1/2-year-old tried to squirm away from Ali, 16 years her senior.</p>
        <p>''He was just holding me and looking at me,'' Lonnie says in the film. ''And I don't know what he said to me. Everything from there is just a blackout.''</p>
        <p>Ali is 58 years old and irresistible at events like the screening. Parkinson's syndrome restricts his speech and mobility, but not his penchant for performing magic (like the disappearing yellow hanky) or his instant attraction to people who want to touch him, or whisper sweet somethings to him. Kiss him and he will pretend to swoon.</p>
        <p>His magnetism is the essence of ''Twice Born,'' which NBC plans to show on Sept. 30, the next-to-last day of the Summer Olympics. It is a skillful appreciation supported by two anchor events: Ali's gold-medal victory at the 1960 Summer Olympics and his lighting of the caldron at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''We had two unbelievable moments in Olympic history highlighted by this man,'' said Lisa Lax, who produced the film with Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports.</p>
        <p>When plans for a film about the 1956 Summer Olympics, from Melbourne, Australia, did not pan out, Ebersol shifted to Ali. Ebersol had convinced Atlanta Olympic officials of the wisdom of having Ali, not Evander Holyfield, light the caldron.</p>
        <p>''I remember Lonnie saying that Ali had stayed up all night in his white outfit with the unlit torch after the opening ceremony, reliving the whole night,'' Ebersol said. ''She said it was as if he had been reborn.''</p>
        <p>It is a passionate and sentimental film that includes scenes of Ali praying at his Michigan farm, a recurring vision of a pink Cadillac, Ali's first reward from his Louisville sponsors when he turned pro, and evokes Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black youth from Chicago lynched for whistling at a white woman in Mississippi in 1955, as part of Cassius Clay's racial awakening.</p>
        <p>''I had a hard time with that section until Lisa sold it to me with the song about Till,'' Ebersol said.</p>
        <p>During her research, Lax found an obscure recording of the Bob Dylan song ''The Death of Emmett Till'' by Coulson, Dean, McGuinness, Flint.</p>
        <p>Lax wisely limited the number of talking heads, relying mostly on Lonnie with choice bits from others like Ali's mother-in-law; President Clinton; the writer-sportscaster Dick Schaap; Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer; and Skeeter McClure, an Olympic boxing teammate. ''Each person truly had to mean something to Muhammad,'' Lax said. Marguerite Williams, for instance, who lived across the street from the Clays and was part of Ali's entourage, was a key addition.</p>
        <p>''There have been 20 movies about Ali and nobody had ever interviewed Marguerite,'' Lax said.</p>
        <p>There is no shortage of ways to recall Ali these days. David Remnick's sensational biography, ''King of the World,'' was adapted into a dreadful ABC docudrama. Fox will show another dramatization, ''Ali: An American Hero,'' on Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>On Thursday ''Ali-Frazier I: One Nation . . . Divisible,'' an illuminating documentary about the 1971 Ali-Joe Frazier bout, makes its premiere on HBO. It is not, by contrast, a loving look at Ali, who verbally brutalized Frazier, who would hammer Ali into the canvas with a thunderous left.</p>
        <p>Marvis Frazier, then 11, remembered: ''I said, 'Pop, what did you pray?' He said, 'I asked the Lord, I said, Lord, help me to kill this man because he's not righteous.' ''</p>
        <p>As usual, this HBO work is smartly scored and packed with archival gems and colorful commentary.</p>
        <p>''Ali was ripping around the ring and around Joe and everybody thought, 'Well, he's taunting Joe, he's doing his act,' '' HBO's Larry Merchant recalled. ''Ali said later that he was just saying: 'Two point five million dollars, can you believe it? Two point five million dollars.' ''</p>
        <p>AIRWAVES</p>
        <p>Fox's Dodgers-Cubs game on Aug. 26 will celebrate the 61st anniversary of the first televised baseball game, a two-camera telecast on the station W2XBS at Ebbets Field. Fox will go the first three innings in black-and-white and only JOE BUCK will be announcing. TIM McCARVER will join him in the fourth inning, and with each inning, more cameras, graphics and gizmos will be added. Only the ninth inning will look fully modern. . . . After a four-month suspension, JOHN ANDARIESE has been reinstated as the Knicks' radio analyst on WFAN. Andariese was taken off the air in April for violating Madison Square Garden's internal ticket policy.</p>
        <p>Fox has hired LARRY McREYNOLDS, DALE EARNHARDT's former crew chief, as an analyst for its Nascar telecasts, starting next year. He will join DARRELL WALTRIP, who is retiring from driving. . . . HBO's ''Arliss'' excels with stories that play against the title character's ethically-challenged image. On Sunday, in one of the series' best episodes, the agent represents ED ASNER, who movingly portrays a baseball radio play-by-play man in the early stages of Alzheimer's.</p>
