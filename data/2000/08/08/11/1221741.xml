        <p>As Hillary Rodham Clinton tries to rebut the favorite attack line of Representative Rick A. Lazio, that she has never held public office and has no record for a Senate campaign, she and her husband and their staffs are aggressively trying to reverse the reclusive image that she projected  after her failure on health care reform. Now Mrs. Clinton says that rather than retreating, as the White House maintained, she was in fact working hard behind the scenes proposing, writing and lobbying for certain legislation, budget appropriations and administration policies.</p>
        <p>Her record, she said, includes work on a major Clinton administration child-care initiative, a huge federal-state children's health insurance program, adoption and foster care bills and foreign aid appropriations for small loans overseas.</p>
        <p>''The record's there, and what I did is sort of self-evident I think, but it may come as new information to a lot of people,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a recent interview, acknowledging the contradiction between the years of stressing more traditional first lady duties and the role she claims now.</p>
        <p>The president joined in this week at a fund-raising dinner for his wife, listing various issues and saying, ''She basically had an unprecedented level of activity in her present position over the last eight years.''</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had learned to take a more subtle approach in pushing her projects because of the health care debacle in 1994, a humiliating defeat for the administration that banished her from a public policy role next to her husband. But when she was asked if, by speaking so openly, she might alienate voters disturbed by her deep involvement in her husband's administration, she retorted: ''Well, that's why you never knew about it.''</p>
        <p>Pressed later about whether her new descriptions of acting as, in essence, a senior presidential adviser went beyond the job of first lady, Mrs. Clinton laughed out loud and said: ''I'm not going to have it any more. And the next first lady doesn't have to do it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign dismissed Mrs. Clinton's efforts to establish a legislative history. ''If she were running in Massachusetts, she'd take credit for the Boston Tea Party,'' said Dan McLagan, the congressman's chief spokesman. ''The bottom line is, she's never lifted a finger for New York and is now trying to create an imaginary record.''</p>
        <p>Agency heads, other administration officials, Democrats and some Republicans on Capitol Hill generally confirm Mrs. Clinton's assertions, but say that her role was kept quiet to avoid the kind of vilification she had attracted over her central part in health care policy.</p>
        <p>As Mrs. Clinton put it: ''People were saying, 'We don't care if you exercise influence as long as we don't know about it.' '' In any case, she said, ''I wasn't interested in getting credit for these things.''</p>
        <p>No longer does she consider that tactic politically helpful to her. ''If somebody's going to say, 'Well, she's never done anything,' '' Mrs. Clinton said, ''I'm going to say, 'Well, you know, I want to tell you what I did, and you can make your own judgments.' I think that's a fair and accurate way to have somebody evaluate what I could do in the Senate.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton described her White House issues staff, which has offices in both the West Wing and the old Executive Office Building, ''as part of the domestic policy operation in the White House.'' Although she also has a small staff in the East Wing to handle first lady social responsibilities, Mrs. Clinton said that ''I realized very soon that, you know, if I had some first lady staff over here, I wouldn't be able to get things done.''</p>
        <p>She said that she and her policy staff had the responsibility for pushing legislation and programs that would benefit children, women and health care -- issues that have concerned her, she said, for the last 30 years. Several of Mrs. Clinton's staff members had the title of assistant to the president and were officially on the staff of Bruce Reed, the president's domestic policy adviser, but generally reported to the first lady.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's Democratic supporters on Capitol Hill echo her claims.</p>
        <p>''Her office and her in particular were key allies of ours and the progressives in the Senate who were trying to pursue an agenda in the areas of children, education, health care and job training,'' said Nick Littlefield, who worked with Senator Edward M. Kennedy and was the staff director to the Health, Education and Labor Committee at the time. He added that ''once we discovered that Mrs. Clinton was running a public advocacy organization inside the White House, it followed automatically that we would start talking to her.''</p>
        <p>Although much of Mrs. Clinton's work at the White House was the traditional advocacy and speechmaking of modern first ladies -- and  of Eleanor Roosevelt, her role model -- Mrs. Clinton said that on many issues she was directly involved in the business of government.</p>
        <p>She said, for example, that the Clinton administration program to guarantee free immunizations for poor and uninsured children, passed in 1993, ''was basically drafted in my office under my supervision.'' The program was a precursor to health care and its policy was largely rejected by Congress, but the Clinton administration did get $585 million for vaccines.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also said that her staff had a large part in the development of the Corporation for National Service, the Clinton administration's domestic version of the Peace Corps.</p>
        <p>''I hired Shirley Sagawa, who had been Ted Kennedy's person on national service, and so basically it was my staff that was involved in drafting that legislation,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Eli J. Segal, the first chief executive of the Corporation for National Service and the 1992 Clinton campaign chief of staff, called the first lady's assertion ''100 percent correct.''</p>
        <p>Among her other accomplishments, Mrs. Clinton said she helped to initiate and promote the Children's Health Insurance Program, created by Congress in 1997 to provide $24 billion over five years to states to insure children.</p>
        <p>''She was a one-woman army inside the White House to get this done,'' Mr. Littlefield of the Health, Education and Labor Committee said. He said that he and Senator Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who was the major force behind the bill, enlisted Mrs. Clinton's help in the spring of 1997 when the president became ''skittish'' about the program. Mr. Littlefield said the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, was threatening that it was a ''deal buster'' on the balanced budget agreement that he and Mr. Clinton had reached.</p>
        <p>''At that point we went to Mrs. Clinton and said, 'You've got to get the president to come around on this thing,' '' Mr. Littlefield said. ''And she said, 'Absolutely.' And we very quickly noticed a change. The president was very much on board.''</p>
        <p>She also said she helped to write bills on adoption and foster care, and lobbied for them.</p>
        <p>At the end of the 1997 Congressional session, Representative Dave Camp, a conservative Michigan Republican who was frantically negotiating to save an adoption bill, got a call in the House cloakroom from Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''It was 9:30 or 10 at night,'' Mr. Camp recalled. ''I thought only Congressional night owls did that. I was surprised. You know, you're working wearily on these things, and you're worrying whether this is doing any good.'' Mrs. Clinton gave him a pep talk, Mr. Camp said, and told him the bill was worth it.</p>
        <p>Today, although Mr. Camp is enthusiastically supporting Representative Lazio in the Senate race in New York, he admits that the first lady's intervention was important. ''I want to be honest,'' he said. ''It was helpful to me.''</p>
        <p>The bill, an administration priority intended to speed up the adoption of children in foster care, had been heavily promoted by Mrs. Clinton on Capitol Hill. Four days after her call, it passed the House and Senate and was soon signed into law by the president.</p>
        <p>Almost immediately, Mrs. Clinton and her White House staff began working with the Department of Health and Human Services on a new, related bill to provide more government help to 18-year-olds who leave foster care because of their age. One version of that bill was virtually written in Mrs. Clinton's office, according to Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the Democrat who sponsored it.</p>
        <p>''This was the first lady's priority, and she developed the administration's legislation,'' Mr. Cardin said. ''And pretty much what was passed by Congress was what the administration proposed.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's role, however, is disputed by Republicans, who say they knew nothing about it. ''I wrote the bill,'' said Representative Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut, the Republican sponsor who introduced her own version in the House. Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, a foster parent and the aggressive anti-Clinton House majority whip who pushed the bill, said that if Mrs. Clinton was involved, ''I never saw it.''</p>
        <p>She said she oversaw and helped develop a $21 billion White House initiative on child care. Mr. Reed, the presidential adviser, said that he, Mrs. Clinton and others at the White House worked with other agencies of the government to develop the package of programs, culminating in a December 1997 meeting with agency heads ''that the first lady chaired.'' Present at the meeting, Mr. Reed said, were Robert E. Rubin, then the secretary of the Treasury, and Donna Shalala, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. So far, Congress has given the Clinton administration a small part of what it requested.</p>
        <p>She also took credit for helping to procure $140 million annually in the foreign aid budget for micro-credit, or small-enterprise loans, to help poor women around the world.</p>
        <p>''What we did at her behest was to negotiate a micro-enterprise initiative with Congress,'' said J. Brian Atwood, who was the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development at the time, 1997, when Mrs. Clinton announced the initiative in a speech on Capitol Hill. ''The Congress was very interested in it, but I think she clearly was a catalyst for doing as much.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubin said she also sparked interest in micro-credit programs among treasury officials. ''It isn't that she came out of the White House and said 'Do this, do that,' '' said Mr.  Rubin. But he said that after Mrs. Clinton saw a successful bank for poor women in India, she spoke to him about importing the methods to this country.</p>
        <p>''I don't think people were unaware of micro-credit,'' he said. ''But she really brought the issue to life, and gave it energy. And she did it by persuading everybody else what she had seen. What Hillary did was to get the federal government involved.''</p>
        <p>These are other initiatives that Mrs. Clinton lists as accomplishments:</p>
        <p>*''Save America's Treasures'' has raised $100 to $200 million in public and private money to help preserve 593 designated ''treasures,'' among them the homes of Edith Wharton in Massachusetts and Harriet Tubman in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>*She says she pushed the administration into expanding Medicare coverage, since January 1998, to pay for annual mammograms for Medicare patients age 40 and over. Previously,  Medicare covered mammograms every other year.</p>
        <p>*She helped procure $40 million in government aid for the training of pediatricians at children's hospitals. ''I finally got it into the president's budget,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''And I think I got it into the budget for '99, if I'm right. Then we had to make sure that it stayed in the budget.''</p>
        <p>David S. Weiner, the chief executive of Boston Children's Hospital and a leader of the hospital lobbying group that worked with Mrs. Clinton to get the money, said that ''there were many people involved, but without her initial championing we would have been simply another voice in the wilderness.'' He added that ''she really helped our group of institutions strategically, and she advised us to who the key legislators were that we needed to connect with.''</p>
        <p>In the interview this month, Mrs. Clinton also said that after the painful health care defeat, she learned more subtle approaches to dealing with Congress.</p>
        <p>''It's important that you get total Congressional buy-in from the very beginning,'' she said, ''and not just lip service about the process.'' She explained: ''We thought we were doing what the leadership wanted us to do when it came to health care. But we assumed too much. We should have had them do much more of the involved work. They basically said, 'We can't figure out how to do this ourselves, so you go do it.' And we didn't understand that at that moment we should have said: 'Well, no, that's not the way it's going to work. We'll help you do what you want to do, you know,' even if it was our idea.''</p>
        <p>On the subsequent adoption and foster care bills, Mrs. Clinton said: ''You had to go around planting ideas with people. You had to go around sort of eliciting interest, and then saying, 'What a good idea. We might be interested.' ''</p>
        <p>She added, ''We always tried to create the opportunity for it to be their idea, their legislation, their name on it. We'd push it, we'd help draft it, we'd lobby it, I'd do what I needed to do. But it needed to be a real partnership in order to be successful.''</p>
