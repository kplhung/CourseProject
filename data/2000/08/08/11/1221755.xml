        <p>The Justice Department will ask a major university to review a government e-mail surveillance program that is seen as both a great boon to law enforcement and a serious threat to privacy. Attorney General Janet Reno said yesterday that the program, used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and called Carnivore because it can quickly gobble up and digest huge quantities of e-mail messages, will be studied in depth, and that the university's recommendations will be shared with the public. Ms. Reno said she would weigh the results before the department determines how Carnivore will be used in the future.</p>
