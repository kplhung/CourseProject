        <p>No one yet knows what caused a disproportionate number of Firestone tires to fail on Ford Explorers, or why many of the failed tires seem to have come from one Firestone plant in Decatur, Ill. But when it comes to tire design, manufacture and composition in general, experts are unanimous about one thing: Tires on the road today are safe, when they are used as intended.</p>
        <p>''The general reason for tire failure is tire abuse by drivers, not tire manufacture,'' said Edward J. Wagner, a consultant in Louisville, Ky., who often serves as an expert witness -- both for and against tire companies -- in product liability lawsuits. Among other mistakes, consumers let their tires get low on air, or put the wrong size of tires on their vehicles.</p>
        <p>In November, Consumer Reports studied six all-weather tires for sport utility vehicles -- none of them made by Firestone. It checked how well they braked, took corners, held the road in snow or rain and otherwise performed. ''We've found no tires with dangerous performance attributes,'' said R. David Pittle, technical director of Consumer Reports.  Even the lowest-ranked tire -- a Goodyear Wrangler RAF -- ''ranked in the middle of good,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That was not always the case, of course. When radial tires were introduced in the United States in the late 1970's, they brought their share of problems. Most were reinforced with fiberglass, which often broke. And many had sidewalls that bulged out, causing bumpy rides. One early radial, the Firestone 500, leaked air, making it the subject of one of the largest tire recalls in history.</p>
        <p>Now, all tire manufacturers use durable steel belts. And most tires are made of sophisticated rubber compounds that can withstand heat and friction. ''You almost can't buy a bad tire these days,'' said Robert Ulrich, editor of Modern Tire Dealer.</p>
        <p>No one is suggesting that tires are commodities, differentiated only by advertising. Indeed, they are highly engineered products, with each company keeping its particular curing temperature, tread design and cocktail of rubber compounds a closely held trade secret.</p>
        <p>Tires can be made up of as many as 200 different materials, from rubbers to plastics to steel, amalgamated into more than 30 components. Some parts, like the tread or sidewall, are visible. Others, like the steel belts for reinforcement, or the butyl rubber interliners to keep air from leaking, are on the inside. There are layers, called plies, of polyester, rayon and other materials. Most tires have high-tensile steel wires, called beads, that keep tires seated against the metal wheels.</p>
        <p>Each line of tires has a slightly different tread designed for hugging the road better in wet weather, but all of them operate loosely on the principle that the placement or depth of grooves on the tire can keep the tire from accumulating water and hydroplaning. Similarly, manufacturers tinker with the makeup of rubber compounds to increase traction, and redesign treads to give a quieter ride.</p>
        <p>Every tire represents tradeoffs. Put in a lot of carbon black to make the tire more resistant to cuts and it may have traction problems on wet pavements. Add silica to reduce resistance -- and thus increase fuel economy -- and there can be a static electricity buildup that causes a mild shock if you touch the car.</p>
        <p>In Europe, some tire manufacturers have added extra nylon reinforcement to make tires more durable. Joan Claybrook, director of Public Citizen, the consumer rights group, has frequently suggested that American tire manufacturers do the same. But most American tire experts say the nylon does not add anything to tire performance.</p>
        <p>But for the most part -- ad campaigns to the contrary -- tires are compatible, making it possible for consumers to replace one tire at a time with whatever brand they prefer.</p>
        <p>All tires are manufactured to specifications laid out by the Tire and Rim Association, a trade group that decides the minimum and maximum amount of air the tire should hold and the size of car or load it should carry. The ''DOT'' stamp that  appears on tires is a Department of Transportation certification that the tires conform to the association's standards and have passed its tests for resistance to puncture, endurance, stability and such.</p>
        <p>''Every manufacturer makes their tires compatible expressly so consumers can move between Brand A and Brand B and Brand C,'' said William M. Hopkins, Goodyear's vice president for technical planning.</p>
        <p>There have been cases of companies voluntarily recalling tires because the beads were cracking, or for other structural problems. But Marvin Bozarth, executive director of the International Tire and Rubber Association, says the vast majority of the recalls over the last 20 years were of tires that had been inadvertently mislabeled, not tires that had performed badly.</p>
        <p>''There are small differences among tires, but there are no big differences,'' he said.</p>
