        <p>Clinton administration officials are close to resolving national security concerns and allowing NTT Communications of Japan to buy Verio Inc., a United States Internet service provider, people involved in the negotiations said today.</p>
        <p>The $5.5 billion deal has become a test case of the F.B.I.'s power to police the Internet and guard against espionage when a company controlled by a foreign government buys an American Internet gateway. NTT Communications is a subsidiary of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone</p>
        <p>Corporation, which is 53 percent owned by the Japanese government.</p>
        <p>Facing a Monday deadline, NTT Communications officials ended a prolonged standoff and offered to adhere to F.B.I. terms that would effectively set up a separate American-controlled office within the Japanese-American company that could execute court-ordered wiretaps without oversight of the Japanese parent company, the people said.</p>
        <p>American officials are also insisting on legally binding commitments that give the government recourse if the combined company fails to cooperate with investigators or compromises the secrecy of law enforcement actions, the people said. Negotiations were continuing today on the details, and a final resolution could come on Friday, they said.</p>
        <p>Shares of Verio rallied today on hopes that NTT Communication's proposed $60-a-share purchase will proceed after a three-month delay. Shares of Verio rose $3.6875, or almost 7 percent, to $57.1875.</p>
        <p>The United States often insists on safeguards when companies controlled by foreign governments buy American telecommunications and military concerns. But this is the first time national security considerations have been raised in the case of a cross-border Internet company acquisition.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. wants to raise a firewall that would make it harder for a company controlled by a foreign government to interfere with official eavesdropping or to use Internet service providers for espionage. Internet service providers route data for their customers, very much in the way phone companies handle voice and data communications.</p>
        <p>Until negotiations resumed today, NTT Communications and Verio had been reluctant to agree to set up a structure like the one the F.B.I. wanted, people involved in the talks said. The companies were said to fear that doing so might put them at a competitive disadvantage because customers might think that their data would be better protected by other service providers.</p>
        <p>The case prompted an investigation by an interagency task force known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is headed by the Treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers. Unless the matter is resolved amicably, the committee must report to President Clinton by Monday with a recommendation on whether the president should block the deal for national security reasons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers called a high-level meeting with numerous cabinet officers and senior White House officials to discuss the standoff, but canceled the session this morning after NTT Communications put a new offer on the table, people involved in the matter said. The remaining disagreements were described as relatively minor.</p>
        <p>American officials said Mr. Summers could convene the committee's principals by phone on Friday to end the investigation and remove obstacles to the merger if the negotiations produce an agreement.</p>
        <p>Clinton administration officials were thought to be highly reluctant to block the transaction, fearing it would send a negative signal about foreign investment in the fast-growing American Internet sector.</p>
        <p>The investigation comes as Deutsche Telekom's proposed $50 billion purchase of the VoiceStream Wireless Corporation has run into Congressional opposition on national security grounds. Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, has introduced legislation that would prevent an acquisition like the one proposed by Deutsche Telekom, which is 58 percent owned by the German government. The Clinton administration has opposed the Hollings legislation.</p>
        <p>Brett Lambert, a security expert with DFI International who has followed the NTT Communications-Verio proceedings, said the merger, if completed successfully, could become the standard for foreign purchases of Internet service providers.</p>
        <p>''I think everyone will breathe a sigh of relief because they want this to be a model,'' Mr. Lambert said. ''NTT basically has had to carry water for other Internet deals down the road.''</p>
        <p>Public relations professionals for the two companies involved did not return phone calls seeking comment. A Treasury department spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
