        <p>As the new digital technologies continue to transform the movie business, established companies are looking for ways to protect their franchise while taking advantage of new opportunities. One example is IFC Films, an offshoot of the Independent Film Channel cable network, which was itself an offshoot of Bravo, the upscale cultural channel that started up in 1980.</p>
        <p>Under the direction of Jonathan Sehring, the president of IFC Films, and Caroline Kaplan, the vice president for production and development, the company has branched out from creating programs for its parent network into producing full-length features for theatrical distribution.</p>
        <p>With IFC's ''Boys Don't Cry'' winning an Oscar for the actress Hilary Swank and ''Girlfight,'' a drama about a female boxer from Brooklyn, poised to become the indie hit of the fall season, it's been a good year for Mr. Sehring and Ms. Kaplan.</p>
        <p>But they aren't resting on their laurels. They've just sprung another offshoot, teaming with the producers Gary Winick and John Sloss to create Independent Digital Entertainment, a k a InDigEnt.</p>
        <p>''Right now it's five movies,'' Mr. Sehring said, ''but it's going to be an ongoing series of movies done by filmmakers with pretty good casts, inspired by Dogma 95, but with a New York slant.''</p>
        <p>Dogma 95 is the semiserious movement spawned by the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier as a reaction against Hollywood inflation. The idea is to make digital video films quickly and cheaply, without recourse to fancy lighting, special effects or music. ''We don't have the Dogma rules, other than the budget, which initially was to make 10 films for $100,000 each,'' Mr. Sehring said. ''So for a million dollars we'll have a whole slate.''</p>
        <p>''Half of the revenue, from the first dollar, goes to the creative talent,'' he said, a radical departure from Hollywood accounting practices. ''So a lot of pretty well-known actors, directors and writers are working for scale, because they're sharing revenue from the outset.''</p>
        <p>The initial projects are ''Final,'' directed by Campbell Scott and starring Denis Leary and Hope Davis, and Ethan Hawke's ''Last Word on Paradise,'' with Uma Thurman and Kevin Corrigan. ''We're not into making made-for-cable movies,'' Mr. Sehring said. ''When we make a movie, we want it to go out theatrically and we want it to go to pay television. We get the cable window after it runs on pay TV and we get the library rights.''</p>
        <p>Non-InDigEnt projects for the next year include ''Waking Life,'' an animated feature directed by Richard Linklater (''Slacker''), and ''Monsoon Wedding,'' a new film by Mira Nair (''Salaam Bombay!'') currently shooting in India. ''The one thing we are steadfast about is not having any creative control over a project,'' Mr. Sehring said, ''which is why we've had a lot of world-class filmmakers come to work with us, from John Sayles and Steven Soderbergh early, to Rick and Mira now.</p>
        <p>''We're involved when they want us to be involved, and if they don't want us, we stay away. Rick sometimes feels it's a bit disconcerting because he hasn't heard from us. He'll call in and say, 'Don't you want to know what's going on?' and we're like, 'Yeah, whenever you want to tell us.' We told you we'd leave you alone, and we're leaving you alone.''</p>
        <p>Donal Who?</p>
        <p>When Donal Logue won the best actor award at January's Sundance Film Festival, for playing Dex, a pudgy Don Juan in Jenniphr Goodman's ''Tao of Steve,'' he was hailed as a gifted newcomer -- an ambiguous compliment for this character actor who has appeared in almost 40 features since 1989.</p>
        <p>''I remember people at Sundance asking, 'Is this your first movie?' '' said Mr. Logue on a recent New York visit. ''And I thought, that's cool. It's weird that you can work so much for 10 years and support yourself and get around and not appear on the radar anywhere. But then the times I did appear on the radar, I played parts so different from each other that people didn't put together that I was the same guy. And that's cool, too.</p>
        <p>''I'm completely into that element of being unrecognizable to some degree from part to part to part. Like Jimmy, this weird cab driver guy that I did on MTV, to the gay cancer guy in 'The Band Played On,' to the vampire in 'Blade' whose hand gets cut off, to Dex in 'The Tao of Steve.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Logue, in fact, can currently be seen in three movies on New York screens: ''Steve,'' for which he received warm reviews; ''The Patriot,'' in which he has a supporting role (a Southern soldier who overcomes his racism); and ''The Opportunists,'' a hangdog heist comedy opening today that finds Mr. Logue as a not-so-sharp security guard (review, Page 13).</p>
        <p>''All of us want to hit the homer,'' Mr. Logue said. ''But movies are sometimes made in the trenches, by the guys in the smaller parts. And sometimes you have more freedom, because you have less to carry so you can do wilder stuff. But at the same time I'm glad, now that I've had my chance to carry a movie, that people would respect it.''</p>
        <p>A Fable of Immigration</p>
        <p>Speaking of ''The Opportunists,'' the film is the work of Myles Connell, a 36-year-old Dublin native who now lives in Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. The film, on one level, is an ironic fable about immigration and the American dream. Its central character is Michael, a young Irishman (Peter McDonald) who turns up on the of his long-lost cousin Vic (Christopher Walken) in Sunnyside, Queens. Michael expects to find a prosperous businessman; instead he finds a safecracker on parole. Not to be dissuaded from his dream of riches, Michael pressures Vic into undertaking one last job.</p>
        <p>''You see so many New York crime movies that are just fast cars and guns and people lying in pools of blood, and I just wanted to do something different, that was based more around a character who was just trying to make a go of it,'' Mr. Connell said.</p>
        <p>''Vic to Michael is a little bit of a metaphor for his relationship to coming to America. For people who come here from different places, there's much more opportunity to get an education and so on here. You come to appreciate the things you get here that maybe you don't get at home. Michael is much more devious, but there's something of me in him.</p>
        <p>''The old immigrant neighborhoods, and the way people stay for a generation or two and then disperse out into the rest of the country, were fascinating to me,'' Mr. Connell said. ''I wanted to create, out of those neighborhoods, a sense of a village. I showed the movie in France, and a critic there said he thought it was a very bucolic film. I took it as a compliment.''</p>
