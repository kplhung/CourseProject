        <p>Verizon Communications agreed to make it easier for unions to organize some of its employees now in nonunion jobs in the company's wireless division, people close to the talks said, resolving an issue at the heart of the strike by more than 86,000 workers.</p>
        <p>Although there are other issues still to be resolved, and labor experts said it remained unclear whether the wireless workers would want to join a union, the strike's chief sticking point has been settled, a development that could hasten the end of the strike.</p>

        <p>Verizon Communications agreed to make it easier for unions to organize some of its employees now in nonunion jobs in the company's wireless division, people close to the talks said, resolving an issue at the heart of the strike by more than 86,000 workers.</p>
        <p>Although there are other issues still to be resolved, and labor experts said it remained unclear whether the wireless workers would want to join a union, the strike's chief sticking point has been settled, a development that could hasten the end of the strike.</p>
        <p>The concession by Verizon could have far-reaching industry implications, coming from the company that is both the nation's largest wireless carrier and the largest local telephone company. It was formed by Bell Atlantic's recently completed acquisition of the GTE Corporation.</p>
        <p>The strike has strained relations between Verizon's management and its striking workers. In New York, about 8,000 striking workers protested outside the company's headquarters on Avenue of the Americas at 42nd Street in a rally that spilled into Bryant Park.</p>
