        <p>KROSNEY-Neil. The Board of Governors and Members of the Elberon Baiting Club mourn the untimely passing of our longtime member and dear friend, Neil Krosney. He served with distinction as our Past President and Chairman of our Board of Governors for many years. As someone who truly enjoyed EBC the empty lounge in front of his cabana will serve as a constant reminder of a friend lost before his time. Our heartfelt condolences to his entire family. He will be sorely missed. Robert Fagenson, President Jane Guadagno, Secretary</p>
        <p>KROSNEY-Neil. To Pam, Hillary and Judson, we share the sorrow of your loss. Through all the years we knew Neil, no matter how small the problem, or how late the hour, he was always there for us and our kids. The shock of losing a friend and contemporary can only be softened by the wonderful memories of our friendship. In lasting love and remembrance. Margaret and Robert Fagenson.</p>
        <p>KROSNEY-Neil. The Officers, Trustees and Members of the Hollywood Golf Club note with sorrow the passing of their longtime friend and member, Dr. Neil Krosney. We offer our heartfelt condolences to his family. Bernard D. Karasic, President Charles Weissman, Secretary</p>
