        <p>It took only a short time before Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis got a taste of what his return to the National Football League was going to be like after the nationally televised trial in which he was accused of killing two people.</p>
        <p>The Ravens were scrimmaging recently against the Washington Redskins and Lewis was doing what he always does: hitting hard, running fast, simply dominating. Suddenly the voice of a fan wearing a Redskins jersey rose over the clang of banging shoulder pads. Other voices joined in.</p>
        <p>They yelled to Lewis, ''We know you did it.''</p>
        <p>Lewis had been waiting for that first comment from a fan, and when it came, he said, he felt no twinge of anger. He said the harsh words rolled off his back like water in a rainstorm.</p>
        <p>At one point, Lewis had faced the real possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison, where there are no Super Bowls or big paychecks. So tough words from a few fans meant little to him.</p>
        <p>''They don't play in between the lines,'' Lewis said. ''I do. You know what? Guys who yell that stuff aren't fans; they're jerks. I can't let them bother me.''</p>
        <p>Little seems to bother Lewis right now as he works his way back to normalcy in his private and professional lives while simultaneously changing his lifestyle. Lewis maintains that he will now choose his friends better and that when he does go to a night club, he will try to avoid the more raucous hangouts.</p>
        <p>Lewis also says he will take the extraordinary step of hiring an off-duty police officer to accompany him whenever he is in a social setting.</p>
        <p>A bodyguard for an All-Pro N.F.L. linebacker? Not bodyguard in the true sense of the word; after all, Lewis has muscles on top of his muscles. He simply wants an extra set of eyes to watch his back.</p>
        <p>''There are certain situations where I might go out and do something with friends or my teammates,'' Lewis said. ''Even in the most careful setting something can happen. I want to make sure what happened to me in Atlanta never happens again. I want to have an officer with me who will say, 'Ray Lewis was with me the entire time.' That's what you have a bodyguard for.''</p>
        <p>Please forgive Lewis if he seems overly cautious. As recently as May, he was wearing an orange prison jumpsuit after being accused of taking part in the stabbing deaths of two men outside an Atlanta night club hours after the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>Lewis and two friends, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting, were charged with murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.</p>
        <p>The trial ensued and Lewis, rightly or wrongly, became a symbol of N.F.L. athletes run amok. But the prosecution's case crumbled and in early June the murder charges were dropped in exchange for a guilty plea by Lewis to obstruction of justice, a misdemeanor.</p>
        <p>Lewis admitted that he had not told police investigators all that he knew about the murders when he was questioned shortly after the incident, and that he had told his co-defendants to say nothing about what had happened. As part of the deal, Lewis agreed to testify against Oakley and Sweeting, who were later found not guilty by a jury.</p>
        <p>Despite those tortuous months, anyone expecting a downtrodden, or extremely bitter, Lewis will be disappointed.</p>
        <p>''I can sit here and gripe, I can grind, I can be mad at the world and hate everybody,'' he said. ''But that's not me.</p>
        <p>''But let me be honest with you. You're always going to have some moments where you have these thoughts in your mind saying, 'Why would people treat me like that?' That's the tough part about it. Not to the point where I want revenge.</p>
        <p>''No, I didn't like the way the prosecution treated me. No, I didn't like the way the police handled me. I did not like that. Never will. But I don't hold a grudge. I'll just never have dinner with those guys.''</p>
        <p>The experience actually motivated Lewis, who at age 25 is already one of the N.F.L.'s premier linebackers. Lewis was the league's leading tackler last season, with 167, and he has been selected for the Pro Bowl three times in his four N.F.L. seasons. His team will play a preseason game with the Jets tomorrow night in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Lewis worked out each day after court in Atlanta with his good friend Shannon Sharpe, and as a result Lewis is a sturdy 253 pounds with 7 percent body fat. He is in the best shape of his career.</p>
        <p>''What was happening to me made me push myself even harder,'' Lewis said. ''Sometimes we would walk out of the weight room, and then turn around and go back in, because I would think of the trial, and it would make me angry, and then I'd want to take it out on the weights.''</p>
        <p>He now reaps the benefits of those workouts, as does his team. Because of solid free-agent signings, including that of Sharpe, a tight end from Denver, an excellent draft from the most underrated personnel department in football and a motivated Lewis on what last season was already the league's second-ranked defense, there is no question Baltimore is a Super Bowl contender.</p>
        <p>The Ravens are dreaming of a championship, but their motivation goes beyond X's and O's. The players -- indeed, the entire organization -- have rallied around Lewis.</p>
        <p>To a man, his teammates view him as someone who made serious mistakes in judgment with his choice of friends and his lying to the police, but nevertheless was someone overcharged by a zealous prosecutor.</p>
        <p>No one in football was more loyal to Lewis than the Ravens' owner, Art Modell. When Lewis needed money to pay for an estimated $1.5 million in legal fees, Modell advanced a portion of Lewis's salary. Most of all, Modell defended Lewis, both to the N.F.L. and to the public.</p>
        <p>Part of Modell's motive was keeping a great talent from going to prison, but an equally large reason was Modell's belief in being loyal to his players. Modell says he also felt strongly that Lewis was not guilty of murder.</p>
        <p>''I was criticized by people in the league office for leading with my chin,'' Modell said. ''I told the league, 'If I am going to lead, it should be with my chin.' People in the league said, 'Well what if he's guilty?' I told them, 'He's not capable of killing anybody.' ''</p>
        <p>It does not take long when watching a Ravens practice to hear a sudden sound that is a cross between colliding cars and a bolt of thunder. The noise is Lewis crashing into a running back or an offensive lineman. No player in the sport hits harder and none is more motivated.</p>
        <p>''When I think about where I could have ended up, where I might be right now,'' Lewis said, ''that makes football all the more important.''</p>
