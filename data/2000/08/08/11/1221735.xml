        <p>The South Africa Government presented its most comprehensive plan yet for the privatization of the largest state-owned companies, saying it would sell off stakes in the nation's power utility, rail system and port operator and offer shares in the telephone company and national airline. While the strategy has been in the works for months and many major points have been discussed, the announcement signaled an effort to consolidate the plans and accelerate the process. Officials would not disclose the timetable for each of the entities, saying only that they hoped the process would be completed by 2004.</p>
