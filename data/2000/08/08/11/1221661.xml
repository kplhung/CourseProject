        <p>The entertainment industry is facing the Democratic National Convention here next week with some last-minute jitters. Vice President Al Gore's choice of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running mate has chilled wealthy Hollywood Democrats, who are upset that Mr. Lieberman is one of the Senate's most vocal critics of Hollywood.</p>
        <p>With moguls like Lew Wasserman, the former chairman of MCA, and David Geffen, one of the owners of Dreamworks, and stars like Barbra Streisand set to open their gated compounds for Democratic fund-raisers and parties, Hollywood is hardly in a mood to publicly voice nervousness about Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>In fact, Democrats here who were once dismayed about his negative views of Hollywood are now eager to play them down, if not ignore them, while Republicans are delighted to remind Democrats that Mr. Lieberman's positions are precisely those of many in the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>''It's so ironic -- they pick the chief Democratic critic of Clinton as well as Hollywood,'' said Tom Strickler, a partner at the Endeavor talent agency, and a Republican who supports Gov. George W. Bush for president.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Lieberman said that if the entertainment industry ''continues to market death and degradation to our children and continues to pay no heed to the genuine bloodshed staining our communities, then one way or the other the government will act.''</p>
        <p>As the Senate's fiercest Democratic critic of Hollywood and what he views as society's moral decay, Mr. Lieberman has led hearings on violence in video games and deplored sex and violence in films and television. That over the years he has teamed up with William J. Bennett, a cabinet secretary for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush who has denounced Hollywood's values, has also angered Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has called some top Hollywood supporters to ask what they thought of his running mate and received positive response. But his own relationship with Hollywood is hardly as warm as that of President Clinton, who not only seems to enjoy palling around with the Hollywood elite, but has also raised millions in campaign contributions here. In return, Mr. Clinton has treated his supporters here seriously, giving them the kind of importance they crave.</p>
        <p>Jim Wiatt, a top talent agent who is president and chief executive of the William Morris agency, and a Democrat, said, ''It's intolerable to think of the government regulating our business and content, and Senator Lieberman has been vocal to the point where he needs to tone down his rhetoric and not make this industry the whipping boy for the decline of Western civilization.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wiatt added that the presidential campaign was hardly about one issue and that Mr. Lieberman's record on most issues was in accord with the views of many people in Hollywood.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the actor Warren Beatty, a liberal Democrat, spoke a bit haltingly about Mr. Lieberman and his positions.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's possible to attribute the high level of mayhem in this country to movies and music,'' Mr. Beatty said. ''He's a talented man and an honest man. He's a man of obvious truthfulness. He's a conservative Democrat. There's no question about it.''</p>
        <p>Jeff Berg, chairman of International Creative Management, a top talent agency, said: ''Some of the things Lieberman has said about lyrics, content and theme are in basic conflict with the creative process. I disagree with that specific theme. I still think the vice president made a bold choice in picking him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's boldness in selecting an Orthodox Jew was greeted with both enthusiasm and some uneasiness in a community that has seen attacks on Hollywood by conservatives as  veiled anti-Semitism.</p>
        <p>But the selection has, in a way, turned the issue upside down. Republicans here said that if their vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, had condemned Hollywood and invoked God in his speeches, Hollywood would have been in an uproar.</p>
        <p>''The Democrats could have selected Idi Amin as vice president and Hollywood would have welcomed him,'' Mr. Strickler said. ''There's so much hypocrisy here. The people here accept every invitation to the White House. Except when they had a conference on violence in the media. No one showed up for that.''</p>
        <p>Lionel Chetwynd, a writer-producer who identified himself as ''one of the three out-of-the-closet Republicans in Hollywood,'' said that the fact that Mr. Lieberman talked about his religion and God -- and was not a right-wing zealot -- had left Hollywood liberals confused.</p>
        <p>But some of the wealthiest Democrats in the entertainment business who are especially friendly with Mr. Clinton -- at least publicly -- expressed delight with Mr. Gore's selection.</p>
        <p>''It's a fantastic choice,'' said Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax and a producer of a postconvention fund-raising show at the Shrine auditorium next Thursday. ''It reaches to the McCain independents; it reaches a wider net.''</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Katzenberg, another owner of Dreamworks, said: ''Yes, Lieberman has been critical, and held us in Hollywood to a very high standard. It's not something we have often agreed upon in terms of the solution. But to have someone as direct and honest and doesn't pull punches is what leadership is all about.''</p>
        <p>Over the last three decades, the heavily Democratic Hollywood elite has used its money to embrace national candidates. But many contributors here do so not simply because they agree with a candidate on the issues, but also because they revel in the games that powerful politicians play.</p>
        <p>''I've seen people all the time hang out with politicians who have one or two positions that would probably revolt one's values or preferences,''  said Bob Bookman, a prominent literary agent at the Creative Artists Agency, and a Democrat. ''But they're both driven by a sense of power.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman will probably not hurt the Democratic ticket financially. Mr. Gore has raised at least $880,000 in Hollywood, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. This compares with about $688,000 raised by Mr. Bush and $22,000 for Ralph Nader, the Green Party's presidential nominee.</p>
