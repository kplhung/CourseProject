        <p>When was it that the films of John Waters stopped seeming so subversive and began feeling like nostalgia-drenched fables of rebellion with a warm and fuzzy tinge? Or is just that the times have changed enough for us to realize that Mr. Waters's movies have always essentially been cheery twisted sitcoms improvised by a goofy extended family in an imaginary suburban attic? Snug in their Saturday afternoon play world, the actors gleefully pluck whatever garish costumes catch their eye from a giant trunk and turn the pop culture wars of the last half-century into sophisticated children's theater.</p>
        <p>Watching Mr. Waters's movies, you always have the us-against-them notion of 1950's squares being tweaked by bohemians, hippies and freaks. Or, to look at it differently, the world is divided into grim, gray-faced adults and a liberated minority who refuse to grow up and like nothing better than to expose themselves at the dinner table.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, of course, the notion of us-against-them is almost comforting in its complacency. Yet it is still not entirely shopworn. Even now, Mr. Waters's movies have a way of clearing the air by pointing out that most of us take life, especially sex, far too seriously. Only those with no sense of humor would deny that there is a grain of truth in his reduction of politics, art and sex in the age of television into smut-littered games of dress-up.</p>
        <p>''Cecil B. DeMented,'' his newest comedy, is an amusing, cunningly made but less-than-hilarious outcry against Hollywood philistinism, an easy target if ever there was one. Although the movie takes swipes at everything from Pauly Shore to ''Patch Adams'' to the inflated price of movie popcorn, its spirit is so cheery that little if any genuine outrage registers.</p>
        <p>Like his last movie, the much funnier ''Pecker,'' ''Cecil B. DeMented,'' which opens today at the Angelika Film Center, has a strong autobiographical undertow. It is set in Baltimore, Mr. Waters's hometown, and the cast includes such members of Mr. Waters's informal repertory company as Mink Stole, Ricki Lake and Patricia Hearst. The title character, an autocratic director who is the leader of a guerrilla troupe of cinema terrorists, suggests a mad Stalinist version of Mr. Waters's own background as an underground filmmaker and lends a witty new dimension to the term ''cult director.''</p>
        <p>In ''Cecil B. DeMented,'' Cecil and his band of revolutionaries kidnap a spoiled Hollywood star (Melanie Griffith) at the Baltimore world premiere of her newest movie and force her to star in their own guerrilla production, directed in a style Cecil calls ''ultimate reality.'' Among other inspirations, the movie plays on Ms. Hearst's background as the victim of a political kidnapping who during her ordeal appeared to adopt her captors' cause.</p>
        <p>As the movie bounces along, the pseudonymous Cecil B. DeMented (Stephen Dorff), who is only too eager to die for his cause, suggests a comic hybrid of Charles Manson and Abbie Hoffman made up to resemble Andy Warhol. Glaring maniacally under a shock of blond hair, Mr. Dorff, who has specialized in sullen rebels with and without causes, plays his role more or less straight.</p>
        <p>The role of Honey Whitlock, the glamorous Hollywood star who is whisked off the stage in the middle of a premiere benefit for the Maryland Heart Fund, gives Ms. Griffith her most engaging screen performance since ''Working Girl.'' With her baby-doll voice and pinup figure, wafting a welcoming, compliant sensuality, Ms. Griffith has always projected a mixture of coy dim-wittedness and street smarts, which turns out to be just right for the role of Honey.</p>
        <p>A vain, mean-tempered diva before her kidnapping, Honey is given a sawed-off haircut and satanic makeup that transform her into something vaguely resembling the bride of Frankenstein, but she quickly adjusts to her new life. And as the kidnappers' notoriety spreads and she finds herself a cult movie heroine, she takes to the role of revolutionary, risking her safety to jump off roofs as Cecil and his revolutionary band, the Sprocket Holes, simultaneously stage and film surprise attacks at local movie theaters. In one of the movie's wittiest sequences, they infiltrate the set of a sequel to ''Forrest Gump'' starring Kevin Nealon and run afoul of the Teamsters, who join the local police in chasing them down.</p>
        <p>The Sprocket Holes, a typical John Waters melange of freaks and outcasts, include Cherish (Alicia Witt), a former porn star; Raven (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a Satan-worshiping makeup artist; and Lyle (Adrian Grenier), a pill-popping Method actor. Just about everyone is sexually confused in one way or another. But since Cecil has decreed no sex until the movie is completed, they all live in a state of desperate frustration.</p>
        <p>''Cecil B. DeMented'' is consistently amusing and smart in its choice of targets, but it lacks the manic edge of some of Mr. Waters's earlier movies. Its gross-out moments aren't as joltingly funny. And Ms. Griffith, for all her charm, doesn't project the ravenous comic ferocity that Kathleen Turner brought to her homicidal title role in ''Serial Mom.'' By the end of the movie, it still isn't entirely clear if she has gotten the joke.</p>
        <p>''Cecil B. DeMented'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and profanity.</p>
