        <p>As the first ferry of the morning pulled away from Liberty Island, I found myself nearly alone on deck. Gone were the throngs with backpacks and video cameras that had boarded with me in the Battery, clutching tickets allowing them to ascend into the statue's crown. Instead of an admission card, I was holding photocopies of some postcards, written in Yiddish and dated in the spring of 1912. I was bound for the next stop, Ellis Island, and an appointment with an ancestor.</p>
        <p>He was my paternal grandfather, my namesake, the link in my lineage between Old World and New. He had died, this Samuel Freedman, in 1941, 14 years before my birth. I knew little more about him than the stirring outlines of his immigration. But I did know he had passed through this island, one of the multitudes, some 88 years ago, not long after having sold his original steerage ticket, on a vessel called the Titanic.</p>
        <p>The orphaned son of a cantor named Reichgold from a Polish village outside Lodz, he had adopted the faith of anarchism while still in his teens and been sentenced to death by the czarist regime for his part in a strike. Liberated in a jailbreak, he obtained a forged passport and found his way to England. He steamed to New York under the surname on the passport, one true in its falsity, because he was a freed man indeed.</p>
        <p>Where better to rendezvous with my forebear, then, than on the harbor island where he first touched America. As I came off the ferry, I literally followed the steps he would have taken into the Beaux-Arts main building.</p>
        <p>A decade ago, the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation finished restoring the structure from its limestone base to its hundred-foot copper-domed towers, transforming a neglected monument into the Ellis Island Museum of Immigration. And as I approached, past the manicured flower beds and gleaming windows and flawlessly pointed brick walls, I wondered if it had not been made too perfect a replica of its former self. How could a place that must have been teeming and clamorous on the day one Samuel Freedman arrived be so serene and tidy for another?</p>
        <p>Then, passing through the entry doors, I stood before an exhibit of baggage. There were steamer trunks and woven baskets, carpet bags in geometric designs and a metal box with the name Hughes stenciled on its flank, piled one atop another into a kind of palisade. The display served as a reminder that here, in the ground-level hall, immigrants were separated from their belongings until America had decided whether or not to admit them. But for me, gazing on the oldness, the wornness, the scuffed and torn surfaces of those bags felt like a collision with the past itself.</p>
        <p>A stairway led me up to the Registry Room, where immigrants were processed. It is a grand chamber, yes, with its vaulted Guastavino ceiling and its arched windows, giving out to Miss Liberty on one side and Lower Manhattan's bristling skyscrapers on the other. And yet it seemed to me as striking for its smallness, just 160 feet of herringbone tile from end to end. Here in a space not much larger than a high school gym there passed as many as 5,000 newcomers a day, 12 million over Ellis Island's active lifetime.</p>
        <p>The room lay empty now except for six rows of waiting benches and five varnished oak tables for the inspectors. I was drawn not to the majesty of the place or to the precision of its restoration but rather to the imperfections -- the patch of wall where immigrants scratched drawings of seabirds and ships into the cracked plaster, the abraded paint and splintered wood on the benches.</p>
        <p>There I could imagine my grandfather, fretful and fidgeting like the rest. Perhaps he worried he would be deported as a Red, as indeed his hero Emma Goldman was in 1917. Perhaps he feared one of those inspectors would find some medical ground for exclusion, chalking his coat with the insignia for lameness or trachoma or tuberculosis. I know he felt the pressure to find work right away and earn passage for his wife, Rose, because in those postcards that I carried he is accounting for every few dollars he sends her, promising a ticket by July, pleading with her to ''be cheerful, be calm.''</p>
        <p>All these anxieties, the restored Ellis Island made clear, were widely shared, a contagion among the newly arrived. From the Registry Room, I moved through a series of smaller exhibit rooms, each devoted to aspects of processing like medical inspection, detention, denials, reunions.</p>
        <p>Each room included taped recollections of immigrants made in the 1980's, decades after they had arrived, and in creaky voices, still accented with Naples or Galicia or Liverpool, they recounted the stench of steerage, the terror that a wart might render them unfit, the first tantalizing glimpse of American shore. One man likened Ellis Island to purgatory. Another declared, ''In contrast to what I'd been through, Ellis Island was not a haven but a heaven.''</p>
        <p>Berkoff and Dunn, Shlueter and Taldone, Becker and Lenhart -- I tried listening to every one, hoping that I would hear the kind of stories my grandfather took early to the grave. But as I struggled to possess each detail, to distinguish each testimony from the next, my senses grew saturated, overwhelmed. There was too much to know, too much to absorb, too much to feel. When I took a headset from my ear for the last time, I was gasping for air as though I'd just broken the water's surface after a perilously deep dive.</p>
        <p>Around me, though, I spotted all the latter-day Berkoffs and Dunns. By now, several more ferries had reached Ellis Island, and the museum was filling with immigrants from the last generation, those who met America in the International Arrivals building at J.F.K. A Filipino teenager translated an exhibit for her mother. An Indian clicked a snapshot of the plaque describing the registry room. A woman in a chador toted a bag of T-shirts from the gift shop. Immigration present was sealing a compact with immigration past.</p>
        <p>My own business, though, was with history, and so I proceeded to the opposite side of the second floor, where the museum focuses on the peak years of immigration, 1880 through 1924. There were walls covered with passports, walls covered with foreign currency, walls covered with railroad timetables for immigrants traveling on to Cleveland or Duluth. And there were walls of photographs depicting the travails that drove people from Europe and the struggles they undertook in America in which I discovered my grandfather in spirit if not form.</p>
        <p>One portrait showed a dozen Jewish revolutionaries mourning a comrade slain in the Kishinev pogrom of 1903; another captured the anarchist leader Alexander Berkman addressing a rally of the Wobblies. Farther along, I saw a cartoon made in 1910 for the Cloakmakers' Union, depicting a group of workers lofting their arms into one single massive fist. ''In unity,'' read a translation of the Yiddish caption, ''there will be power.''</p>
        <p>My grandfather gave his life to the pursuit of such ideals. He managed the newspaper Freie Arbeiter Shtimme (Free Voice of Labor); he served as secretary for his local in the Waterproof Garment Workers Union; he reared his four children in an anarchist colony in rural New Jersey. He lived long enough, I suspect, to realize America was not ripe for a revolution, and by that measure maybe he died a failed man. How I wish that he could have seen his vision of America, however unfulfilled, hallowed by its display here on Ellis Island.</p>
        <p>The very existence of this museum is a triumph for unruly, polyglot, mongrel America, as two particular exhibits vividly demonstrated. One collected the anti-immigrant propaganda that helped lead to the enactment of brutal quotas in 1924; an editorial cartoon, emblematic in its tone, portrayed Uncle Sam clinging to a rocky shoreline against a tide labeled ''Riff-Raff Immigration.''</p>
        <p>More devastating in its way, though, was a gallery of photographs of Ellis Island in its abandoned state. Thirty years after immigration quotas were enacted, the island closed. Even after President Lyndon B. Johnson declared it a national monument in 1965, the same year he signed legislation undoing the draconian 1924 law, Congress couldn't be bothered to authorize money for its repair. The photographs bore witness to the result -- shattered windows, floors littered with paint flakes, doors overgrown by ivy, a crumpled flag on a deserted desk.</p>
        <p>The rehabilitation of the main building, begun in 1982, had to be undertaken not only without public funds but also without massive corporate support of the sort the Statue of Liberty enjoyed. Lee Iacocca, the automobile executive who headed the private restoration effort, devised the idea of raising money directly from citizens. Anyone who donated $100 or more could have the name of a relative who passed through Ellis Island engraved on a commemorative wall outside the museum.</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Iacocca realized it or not, his brainstorm had profound provenance. When the Statue of Liberty was first being erected in the 1880's, it, too, failed to loosen the pockets of the plutocrats. With $100,000 still needed for the pedestal, Joseph Pulitzer, the Hungarian immigrant turned newspaper publisher, appealed to his readers, ''As the rich citizens of New York have shown such apathy in this matter, let the poor citizens move.'' One young woman, like my grandfather an orphan, accompanied her 60-cent donation with the note, ''Drops make the ocean.''</p>
        <p>Four hours after entering the immigration museum, I stepped outside to view the wall. A woman in a sundress was taking a photo of the panel etched with ''Franchi.'' A man rolled his wheelchair to a stop before ''Bosak.'' A girl of perhaps 10, all bony limbs and ponytail, watched as her mother indicated a ''Valenti,'' and explained, ''My mother's mother.'' I overheard another parent telling another child, ''That's great-granddad, who came from Moravia.''</p>
        <p>I could savor these moments of recognition only vicariously. As far as I was aware, nobody in my family had donated money in the name of Samuel Freedman. The failure weighed most heavily on me, his namesake, me with the same wavy black hair and distant, preoccupied eyes I can see in his photograph in the Report of the Waterproof Garment Workers Union, Local 20, printed in both English and Yiddish, dated May 1, 1922.</p>
        <p>Out of curiosity, I edged to the stone panel containing the Freedmans. I wondered who else I might find. But there, halfway down a column, lay the letters, Samuel Freedman, not once but twice. And directly above them, also twice, was the name of his wife, my grandmother, Rose Freedman, who died when I was 2. I think I remember sitting on her lap in her old house in what was left of the anarchist colony. But maybe I've just recalled a photograph and out of sheer longing transformed it into an experience.</p>
        <p>The ferry back to the Battery was already loading. My appointment was complete, more complete than I'd dared to hope. My father, it turns out, had given money in his parents' names. So, evidently, had my uncle or aunt. On the way back to shore, the way my grandfather went to his first American home as a boarder with a family named Vulcan at 37 First Avenue, I unfolded the translations a Yiddish scholar had made of his postcards for me a dozen years ago. For a man dangerous enough for a death sentence in Europe, Samuel Freedman sounded in those cards almost shockingly romantic, both about his young wife and his new land.</p>
        <p>''Rosela, be cheerful and happy,'' he wrote on May 21, 1912. ''You'll soon come to New York and to me, to your one and only dear beloved. I know that it's your dearest dream and wish now. And your most beautiful dream will become a reality.''</p>
        <p>Looking back across the choppy harbor to Ellis Island, that holy place, I knew he had kept his word.</p>
