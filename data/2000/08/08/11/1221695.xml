        <p>I have represented abused and neglected children in court for decades, and, like many others in close contact with the child welfare system, I never bought the predictions that welfare reform would send more parents into the pathology of abuse. I thought the opposite, because I expected the birth rate for teenagers on welfare to go down once the system stopped encouraging births. That would mean fewer families under intense stress.</p>
        <p>So when statistics reported this week showed that child abuse cases have gone down nationwide since the new welfare law was passed in 1996, I was surprised only at how quickly the decline had showed itself.</p>
        <p>In Chicago, the number of abused and neglected children in the system has fallen by nearly half in the years since the old safety net was removed. A major reason is that there are fewer new cases of abuse. In New York, too, cases are decreasing, not increasing.</p>
        <p>In the same years, birth rates for both white and African-American teenagers have also dropped substantially. Certainly, welfare reform is not the complete reason. A thriving economy has to have played a role in giving people an incentive to break old patterns, as has education reinforcing a deliberate message about irresponsible teenage behavior. Though I can't prove it, I believe welfare reform is just as important an ingredient.</p>
        <p>Opponents of welfare reform ridiculed the notion that children were having children in order to get welfare. In the most literal sense, they were right. But children having children had become part of the culture surrounding many girls whose families were on welfare, and government support had allowed it to flourish. The girls having the babies were not equipped to see the consequences in their own lives or their children's.</p>
        <p>A typical abuse case that I see now involves a woman in her early 20's who has between two and four children, usually by different fathers. She had her first child when she should have been reading ''Macbeth'' as a sophomore in high school and her second when she should have been reading ''Hamlet'' as a senior. The fathers have shirked all responsibility and disappeared. By the time the woman is in her 20's, she has four children and no involved man to help her. She turns to drugs as the only viable opportunity for a vacation. Or, as some argue, for self-medication.</p>
        <p>We bring her to court on abuse charges, give her a counselor and ultimately return the children, whereupon she goes back to her bleak housing project, looks out the window and realizes that without an education and job opportunities, her future, and that of her children, is nonexistent. Her depression is based on reality. She ultimately turns back to drugs or liquor or both, and the children are abused or neglected again.</p>
        <p>These cases began when our welfare system was still sending out an illusory promise to inexperienced girls that they and their children would be supported for the rest of their lives. The truth was that the support was absolutely minimal and could never be more than minimal.</p>
        <p>A couple of years ago, one of our lawyers picked up a 14-year-old inner-city girl who had just delivered a baby at a Chicago hospital. On the way out, a social worker warned the girl that the next time she had a child, she should be more serious about prenatal care. Today, the girl would more likely have been warned that having children mortgaged her future and told about ways of controlling her fertility, from abstinence to abortion.</p>
        <p>Has welfare reform worked? It's probably too early to tell. But the social worker's dismissive assumption about an inner-city girl's needs would not be so easy now. Nor could the girl so easily accept repeated early motherhood. I believe this fundamental change will translate into even fewer abused children needing my help a few years from now.</p>
