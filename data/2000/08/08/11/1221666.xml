        <p>Republican Natinal Committee demands that three major television networks devote 'not a minute more' air time to Democratic national convention than they did to Republican convention; officials of ABC, NBC and CBS say that alhough they plan to devote same prime time coverage to both conventions, they reject idea that Republicans can dictate to them what is news and what is not` particularly in regard to coverage of Pres Clinton's convention speech (M)</p>

        <p>In the race to be president, every second counts. At least that was the message Republican officials sought to convey yesterday in demanding that the three major television networks devote ''not a minute more'' air time to the Democrats' convention next week in Los Angeles than they had to the Republican gathering in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in letters to the presidents of the news divisions of ABC, CBS and NBC that he was concerned about reports ''that you now plan to expand and augment your coverage in Los Angeles next week.'' He added the hope that ''based on your commitment to fair and unbiased reporting, you will devote the same amount of time to the Democrats' convention as you did to ours.''</p>

        <p>In the race to be president, every second counts. At least that was the message Republican officials sought to convey yesterday in demanding that the three major television networks devote ''not a minute more'' air time to the Democrats' convention next week in Los Angeles than they had to the Republican gathering in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in letters to the presidents of the news divisions of ABC, CBS and NBC that he was concerned about reports ''that you now plan to expand and augment your coverage in Los Angeles next week.'' He added the hope that ''based on your commitment to fair and unbiased reporting, you will devote the same amount of time to the Democrats' convention as you did to ours.''</p>
        <p>Chief among Mr. Nicholson's worries is that a speech to be delivered by President Clinton on the convention's opening night, Monday, would be given more coverage than the address by Gen. Colin L. Powell on the first night of the Republican gathering. The chairman noted that CBS and ABC ran only portions of Mr. Powell's speech -- NBC covered it only on its cable channel, MSNBC -- and a speech by Laura Bush, the wife of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, which preceded General Powell's address, received even less attention.</p>
        <p>''Are you now planning to give live coverage to Tipper Gore's speech at the Democrats' convention?'' Mr. Nicholson wrote. ''And will you be airing all of Bill Clinton's opening night speech?''</p>
        <p>Officials of ABC, NBC and CBS said yesterday that though they planned to devote the same prime time coverage to the Democrats as to the Republicans, they rejected the idea that Mr. Nicholson could tell them what was news and what was not. They also indicated that the president's speech may have more news value than Mr. Powell's and so it may be harder to interrupt the coverage of his address.</p>
        <p>Paul Friedman, executive vice president of ABC News, said deciding how much time to devote was up to the networks.</p>
        <p>''We'll make decisions on the right amount of time,'' Mr. Friedman said.</p>
        <p>Kim Akhtar, a spokeswoman for CBS News, said her organization is using ''the exact same format'' in Los Angeles. ''But the extent of our coverage is dependent upon news value. Our editorial judgment of news events is not based on some minute by minute calculation.''</p>
        <p>The chairman's letters were not only a reflection of how assiduously politicians seek television parity, but also how decisive convention exposure on the networks is perceived to be.</p>
        <p>Clifford D. May, director of communications for the Republican committee, said the treatment of the convention by the broadcast networks, which command the bulk of the television audience, is a major factor in the campaign. ''These are the parties' featured events every four years,'' he said, ''and how much air time they're given we think does really have an influence and an impact.''</p>
        <p>And because commercial television time is so expensive, Mr. May added, ''If you give one party more time than the other, then in effect you're making a campaign contribution to that party.''</p>
        <p>Although the broadcast networks have been scaling back their prime-time commitment to conventions, Mr. Nicholson's objections seem to be less about the total amount of exposure than about the content of the coverage. As his letters indicated, the Republicans were miffed that speakers were not covered to the degree they were on the cable networks and PBS, which concentrated a lot more on what was happening at the podium, where the parties' messages were conveyed most directly.</p>
        <p>A study by C-Span showed, for instance, that while PBS, CNN and the Fox News Channel all devoted more than six hours to covering speeches at the Republican convention, ABC, CBS and NBC each covered two to three hours of podium speeches.</p>
        <p>Network officials said Mr. Nicholson was not taking into account their ability to be flexible about coverage. NBC News, in fact, added a half-hour of prime-time coverage on the second night of the Republican convention to broadcast Senator John McCain's speech. Barbara Levin, an NBC spokeswoman, said the extra half hour this time would be used for the president's address on Monday.</p>
