        <p>With an eye toward independent-minded voters here and elsewhere on the West Coast, Gov. George W.

        <p>With an eye toward independent-minded voters here and elsewhere on the West Coast, Gov. George W. Bush and Senator John McCain today joined forces on the campaign trail for the first time in the 2000 presidential race, burying their once-bitter rivalry under a resolve to put a Republican in the White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain had wanted passionately to be that man, and his appearance beside Mr. Bush in California, Oregon and Washington this week could be seen as the latest chapter in a tale of political resignation.</p>
        <p>Having formally endorsed Mr. Bush of Texas and having praised him from the stage of the Republican National Convention, Mr. McCain was now hitting the stump with the man who beat him for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>He also did a jig around the questions reporters asked about the sharp differences between him and Mr. Bush on issues like tax cuts and campaign finance reform. Mr. McCain of Arizona redirected their attention toward what he said was his overarching support for, and belief in, Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''We share the core principles of the Republican Party,'' Mr. McCain said at a news conference the men held around midday in Salinas, which sits in the middle of a largely Democratic county with an unusually high percentage of the so-called swing voters who had found Mr. McCain so attractive during the primaries.</p>
        <p>''Primaries are tough,'' he said. ''But never at any time did I intimate that I would do anything but support the nominee of the party.''</p>
        <p>If that made him sound like he was taking a needed dose of medicine -- a metaphor Mr. McCain jokingly used when endorsing Mr. Bush in May -- his comments at an event in Salinas  preceding the news conference were a bit more resounding.</p>
        <p>''I'm proud to be part of this crusade,'' Mr. McCain said then. ''I'm proud of him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said at the news conference that he and Mr. McCain had a long, lasting bond.</p>
        <p>''Primaries are family squabbles,'' he said. ''We were friends before and we're friends now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's advisers said that Mr. McCain's presence had grown from a previous offer to do whatever the Bush campaign thought best for its effort. Mr. McCain proved especially popular with the swing voters prevalent in this region of the country, so Mr. Bush's advisers said that he could be particularly helpful here.</p>
        <p>''We think he has a lot of appeal to California's independent-minded voters,'' said Karen P. Hughes, the campaign's director of communications. Gerry Parsky, chairman of the campaign's California effort, noted that in the state primary in March, Mr. McCain attracted about 725,000 independent or Democratic voters, while Mr. Bush drew only 500,000.</p>
        <p>The joint appearances gave the campaign of Vice President Al Gore an opportunity to turn the tables on the Bush campaign, which had spent the past few days noting policy disagreements between Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore is a strong leader, and it says a great deal about him that he picked someone who does not agree with him on every issue,'' Douglas Hattaway, a Gore campaign spokesman, said. ''Bush apparently lacked that leadership in bypassing John McCain.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hattaway was referring to Mr. Bush's selection of Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary, not Mr. McCain, as his running mate.</p>
        <p>''You won't hear Bush and McCain talking about issues very much,'' Mr. Hattaway added. ''If they actually talked about issues, it would turn into a debate.''</p>
        <p>In Atlanta today, Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman were supposed to use an appearance with four Southern governors to hail the Clinton administration's record in cutting welfare rolls and to promote ''the next critical phase of welfare reform,'' according to a release issued by the campaign.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman made more generic speeches and barely mentioned welfare. Aides said they were not sure why Mr. Gore veered from his planned remarks.</p>
        <p>In the release, Mr. Gore vowed to help long-term welfare recipients find work by extending existing welfare-to-work grants to state, local and faith-based organizations. He also said he would ''fight to promote responsible fatherhood'' by creating programs that help low-income ''dead-broke dads'' find work so they can support their children. He proposed denying credit cards to parents who owe child support.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's appearances with Mr. McCain in Salinas preceded a train trip that they took north toward Sacramento. The men planned to cap three days of campaigning on the West Coast with a visit to Mr. McCain's cabin in Sedona, Ariz., on Saturday. Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, were to be overnight guests of Mr. McCain and his wife, Cindy.</p>
        <p>During the train trip, Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush chatted with reporters for about 25 minutes, and Mr. McCain had plenty of praise for Mr. Bush, especially for his efforts to portray the Republican Party as a home for a broad spectrum of voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain also derided the Gore campaign's efforts to remind voters that he had once attacked Mr. Bush's tax-cut plan as excessive and that he advocated much stricter regulation of campaign contributions than Mr. Bush favors. ''It's foolishness,'' Mr. McCain said, ''and we all know it. And people will take it for that.''</p>
        <p>''Actually,'' said Mr. Bush, ''we're glad they're talking about us. Isn't that right, Senator?''</p>
