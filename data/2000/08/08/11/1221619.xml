        <p>''Money changes everything,'' Cyndi Lauper once sang in her cover of the Brains' original, and as Sally, a bar owner in ''The Opportunists,'' she gets to watch that aphorism take on a sad and poky life. Money could change the life of Vic (Christopher Walken), her boyfriend and the picture's protagonist, an ex-felon who might as well sport a ''Born to Lose'' T-shirt.</p>
        <p>Vic slaves at keeping his struggling auto repair shop alive. In the opening, he is shown lovingly rubbing down a vintage 70's Riviera, buffing it to a gloss worthy of Teo Maniaci's eye-catching cinematography. This is one of the best-photographed pictures of the year, but not ostentatiously so; the look is organic to the less-than-glamorous badlands of Sunnyside, Queens, where the movie is set.</p>

        <p>''Money changes everything,'' Cyndi Lauper once sang in her cover of the Brains' original, and as Sally, a bar owner in ''The Opportunists,'' she gets to watch that aphorism take on a sad and poky life. Money could change the life of Vic (Christopher Walken), her boyfriend and the picture's protagonist, an ex-felon who might as well sport a ''Born to Lose'' T-shirt.</p>
        <p>Vic slaves at keeping his struggling auto repair shop alive. In the opening, he is shown lovingly rubbing down a vintage 70's Riviera, buffing it to a gloss worthy of Teo Maniaci's eye-catching cinematography. This is one of the best-photographed pictures of the year, but not ostentatiously so; the look is organic to the less-than-glamorous badlands of Sunnyside, Queens, where the movie is set.</p>
        <p>Myles Connell, who wrote and directed the picture, gives it the sleepy pace of a late fall day when the biggest event turns out to be waiting to see if the sun will break through the gray haze. The film has the ambience of a real neighborhood, but Mr. Connell can't seem to give it substance. Sometimes it seems to be fading away in front of your eyes.</p>
        <p>''The Opportunists,'' which opens today at the Angelika Film Center, is meant to be a distinct 180-degree turn from the gritty, tense robbery movies that are generally about nothing but moviemaking -- a respectable choice on the director's part -- but the film feels as small-time as Vic.</p>
        <p>Vic is an amiable loser, and Mr. Walken plays the role without the spasms of rage that usually compound the freakishness of his delivery. (His bellowed line ''You're late!'' in ''The Dogs of War,'' the fury rising to a leonine whine on the last word, is a real puzzler.)</p>
        <p>Vic is drawn and slightly defeated; Mr. Walken's lost, trembling cadence makes him seem beaten down by his past life of petty crime. He is still in pain over a robbery he commited 20 years ago, one that cost him his marriage and almost his relationship with his daughter (Vera Farmiga).</p>
        <p>His failing garage keeps him broke, and he won't take a loan from Sally. Then a distant cousin, Michael (Peter McDonald), arrives from Ireland and persuades Vic to mastermind another crime. ''The regular-citizen thing is not going too good,'' Vic says with Mr. Walken's punctuated diction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walken's twitchy, chilled acting style may be the wrong choice for a vaguely sympathetic leading man, though he is vague. No one else gives the kind of line readings he does, which are hypnotic in their own way; he suggests a stoned Kirk Douglas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Connell uses his cast well, and the actors go at the material briskly. Donal Logue and Jose Zuniga, as the security guards who connive with Michael and Vic, are incredibly eager; they watch Vic practice his safecracking as if it were the second overtime of a Knicks playoff game.</p>
        <p>All of the younger characters have an antsiness. Michael's pushy curiosity leads to his almost botching things several times. ''I'm starting to think there's something wrong with you,'' Vic says of Michael's idiotic interference. (Mr. McDonald's downcast face gives him a minor resemblance to Mr. Walken.)</p>
        <p>The movie is full of characters, notably Mort (Tom Noonan), who gets Vic the equipment he needs to prepare for the robbery. Mort is a third-rate version of the expediters who turn up too often in film noir, and Mr. Noonan plays his crabby meticulousness for comedy. Mr. Noonan practices his craft beautifully, and Mort gives him a chance to return to the comedic work with which he began his career on the stage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Connell does well by his actresses, too. Ms. Lauper is so good that her few screen appearances make you want more, and her feistiness makes an impression against Mr. Walken's mannered weightiness. Ms. Farmiga's grounded Miriam is memorable, too. Pieces of ''The Opportunists'' play quite well, enough to make you want to keep an eye on Mr. Connell.</p>
        <p>''The Opportunists'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and mild violence.</p>
