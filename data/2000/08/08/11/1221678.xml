        <p>The relationship between a fan's ardor and violence has remained something of a mystery for psychologists, despite a raft of studies and books on sports hooliganism in recent years.</p>
        <p>Research by Daniel Wann and his colleagues at Murray State University in Kentucky has shown that sports fans, as a group, are no more aggressive than any other segment of society, including people who do not care about sports.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Wann's research and work by other psychologists show that ardent fans can become aggressive or even violent at a sports event when their team is threatened with losing. Fans sometimes throw batteries and other objects at players, or brawl with fans from the opposing team. A theory proposed to explain this behavior is that fans see the team as an extension of themselves, and so feel personally threatened by a loss, Dr. Wann said.</p>
        <p>''These highly identified people are more likely to act in an aggressive fashion when the team suffers,'' Dr. Wann said.</p>
        <p>But there is also ample evidence that ardent fans can become violent after a victory. For instance, violence erupted in downtown Los Angeles in June after the Lakers won the National Basketball Association title. Denver Broncos fans tore up their city in 1998 and 1999 after the team won Super Bowls. Detroit Tigers fans rampaged through the streets and clashed with police after the team's victory in the 1984 World Series.</p>
        <p>In Europe, where nationalist emotions often run high at soccer matches, violence is even more common. This sort of violence owes much to tribalism, psychologists say. Patriotism often mutates into overt violence at soccer matches, as exultant winners are humming with hormonal surges associated with victory and frustrated losers are looking for scapegoats.</p>
        <p>Some violence perpetrated by fans of a winning team may also be linked to surges in testosterone and a feelings of invincibility fostered by soaring self-esteem, psychologists said. Indeed, an older theory -- that watching violent sports serves as a catharsis that makes people less likely to be violent -- has largely been discredited.</p>
        <p>One intriguing study found that doctors see significantly greater numbers of battered women in Washington emergency rooms on the day after the Redskins win than on other days, including after the team loses. The authors of the 1992 study could not prove a link, but theorized that the football victories may have emboldened men to act violently against their spouses and girlfriends.</p>
        <p>A coalition of advocates for battered women used the study in 1993 to bolster a claim that 40 percent more women would be battered on Super Bowl Sunday than on a normal day. But one of the Washington study's authors, Janet Katz, a sociologist at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., said later that the coalition had badly misinterpreted the results, which she described as ''interesting but very tentative findings.''</p>
