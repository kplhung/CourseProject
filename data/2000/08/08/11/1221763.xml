        <p>Lucas Schoormans</p>
        <p>508 West 26th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through Sept. 1</p>
        <p>For 15 years Liz Rideal has made the photo booth, that popular dispenser of instant mug shots, her primary tool. Many artists have toyed with this low-budget technology, but few have explored its formal possibilities so extensively as this British photographer, who is having her first New York solo show.</p>
        <p>Early on Ms. Rideal departed from the conventional photo booth portrait. Works from 1996 to 1998, on view here, focus on colored fabrics that the artist manipulates before the camera's unwavering eye, producing a kind of photographic update of Color Field painting. In the best works here, she collages hundreds of the four-shot strips into large grids. Up close in ''Arras Suite Red'' you can see each little picture shows a slightly crumpled expanse of red cloth. From a distance, more than 800 little red squares coalesce into a lush, vibrating field.</p>
        <p>In other works, Ms. Rideal re photographs photo booth strips and makes montages of enlarged frames. ''Green Veil,'' which measures about 4 by 20 feet, is a grid of two dozen frames, each a different image of translucent green chiffon floating, fluttering or twisting against a white background. (In one frame, the artist's fingers appear, revealing her off-camera performance.) These are less richly concentrated than the collages made from the original strips, but they have an elegant interplay of sensuous fluidity and rhythmic order.</p>
