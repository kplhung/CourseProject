        <p>Mike Piazza rapped his knuckles on the wooden locker stall, chasing away the baseball gods who would zap him for the statement he was making.</p>

        <p>Mike Piazza rapped his knuckles on the wooden locker stall, chasing away the baseball gods who would zap him for the statement he was making.</p>
        <p>''The only thing I can hope is that we as a ballclub keep playing well and pushing it,'' said Piazza, the Mets catcher. ''If we happen to make the playoffs this year, to have a week or so to get ready for the playoffs would be the ideal situation. But as we saw last year, you're not always afforded that luxury.''</p>
        <p>Last season, Piazza caught 30 of the Mets' final 32 games as the team stumbled toward the postseason. It is becoming easier for the Mets to see a safer path to this October.</p>
        <p>They beat the Houston Astros, 10-3, today to complete a 5-2 road trip that followed an 8-1 homestand. The Mets are four and one-half games ahead in the wild-card standings, and trail the Atlanta Braves by two and one-half games in the National League East.</p>
        <p>For the Mets to go farther this season -- to reach the World Series, which was all but mandated by the owner Fred Wilpon in spring training -- it will help if Piazza is rested. He was 4 for 4 today, with four runs batted in, one day after clubbing a 445-foot, three-run homer.</p>
        <p>Piazza's batting average is .351, and he is five runs away from 100 runs batted in. But he is tracking a more important statistic: games caught. Piazza has caught 86 games, and he is nearing the 100-game barrier, a benchmark for catching durability.</p>
        <p>He has gotten extra rest this year from a series of minor injuries, including a sprained knee that gave him three days off this week.</p>
        <p>''There's a risk you run when you're catching so much, physically: the hot weather, the schedule, going back and forth with the time changes, you're just going to hit a wall,'' Piazza said. ''When you get injuries, especially having such quality guys on the ballclub, I know I can take an extra day or two, which has the residual effect of keeping your legs fresh and preventing you from getting that run down.''</p>
        <p>Piazza's legs looked fresh enough today. He took third on a wild pitch and scored in the third inning, and he scored from first on a double by Robin Ventura in the seventh. Ventura also had four runs batted in, on a pair of two-run doubles. Those hits came as the Mets piled on the Astros' bullpen for three-run innings in the seventh and eighth that put the game away.</p>
        <p>By then, Bobby Jones had kept the Astros down. He gave up two bases-empty home runs to Jeff Bagwell, but permitted no other runs over eight innings.</p>
        <p>Jones improved his record to 7-5, and he has a 2.94 earned run average in 10 starts since accepting an assignment to Class AAA Norfolk.</p>
        <p>His teammates have noticed an obvious difference in Jones's confidence. It is reflected in the ground balls he gets, said Ventura, the third baseman, and his presence on the mound. Since Jones returned, there is a feeling that he will get the ground balls he needs. Jones allowed 10 hits today, but he got three ground ball double plays.</p>
        <p>Most of all, Jones, an All-Star in 1997 who seems headed for his first 10-victory season since then, is once again an important contributor.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the guys who came over last year, they didn't get to see me pitch much,'' said Jones, who missed most of 1999 with shoulder problems. ''After the way I started this season, guys were maybe thinking, 'Geez, can this guy pitch? because the first part was such a struggle for me.</p>
        <p>''It's a lot more fun to come to the park knowing I'm going to go out, have good bullpen sessions, come into the game, trust my stuff and my ability, and know that I'm going to make good, quality pitches.''</p>
        <p>Jones missed time with an injury earlier this year, as did Rick Reed and Darryl Hamilton. Both of those players are back, and the Mets with minor injuries -- Edgardo Alfonzo and Jay Payton -- are returning to form.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo hit .458 on the road trip, and Payton homered for the second game in a row.</p>
        <p>Hamilton, who returned on Wednesday after missing four months with an injured toe, started in right field today and scored four runs. On Wednesday, he hit a home run that careened from a wall on the side of a scoreboard and landed in the visitor's bullpen. Today he hit a ball that bounced from the first row of seats back onto the field -- and was ruled in play. Hamilton wound up with a triple.</p>
        <p>Hamilton played right field for the first time in seven years, starting there because Manager Bobby Valentine misunderstood Derek Bell, who Valentine thought asked for an off day on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''He mentioned, 'If you're going to do something, tomorrow would be a good day,' '' Valentine said. ''But it was kind of taken out of context. Suffice it to say, Derek came in today and said, 'Oh, that's not what I meant.' ''</p>
        <p>But if there was any friction between Bell and Valentine, it did not seem so in the dugout. As Bell grooved to a song on the public-address system between the second and third innings, the 50-year-old manager shuffled from behind and boogied past him. Bell, and the rest of the players on the bench, broke up in laughter.</p>
        <p>It was that kind of trip for the Mets, who are carefree and healthy and could be headed for a happy ending.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets are host to the San Francisco Giants for the next four days at Shea Stadium. If the season ended today, the Mets would win the wild card and play San Francisco, which is in first place in the the West, in the Division Series. The Giants swept the Mets in a four-game series at Pacific Bell Park in May, but they are five games under .500 on the road this year. . . . In Baseball America's annual managers poll, the Mets' MIKE HAMPTON, a left-handed pitcher was judged to have the second-best curveball in the National League. One problem: Hampton admits that he rarely throws his curveball. ''They should just call it best breaking ball,'' Hampton said. ''But last year I think I was third, so I guess I'm moving up.''</p>
