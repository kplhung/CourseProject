        <p>Yueling Chen, the first Chinese woman to win an Olympic gold medal in track and field, was granted a waiver by Chinese sports officials yesterday to compete in race-walking for the United States at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>A week ago, the Chinese Olympic Committee objected to Chen competing for the Americans and it appeared that she would be ineligible for Sydney. Although she gained her American citizenship on April 12, international Olympic rules require that an athlete wait three years to compete after becoming naturalized in a new country.</p>
        <p>A waiver is often granted, but the Chinese initially refused. The reason is not clear. Some officials believe Chinese track and field officials resented the fact that a high-profile athlete like Chen came out of retirement in a new country. The first part of her career ended after she won the 10-kilometer race walk at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. She returned to competition in 1998; last month, she finished second in the 20-kilometer walk at the United States track and field trials.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Chinese Olympic Committee sent a letter to the United States Olympic Committee, saying it respected the wishes of its track federation. However, Bill Hybl, president of the U.S.O.C., decided to pursue the case. The two committees have enjoyed cordial relations, and earlier this year, the Chinese granted waivers to three athletes to compete in table tennis and badminton for the United States.</p>
        <p>This week, Hybl sent a fax to the Chinese Olympic committee, saying that a waiver ''would be consistent with the spirit of cooperation and international goodwill that exists between our two nations.'' Hybl then placed phone calls to the top two officials in the Chinese Olympic Committee, President Yuan Weimin and Secretary General Mingde Tu, said Mike Moran, a spokesman for the U.S.O.C. The personal touch seemed to work. Yesterday the Chinese responded positively by fax, granting the waiver to Chen.</p>
        <p>Officials speculated that Beijing was reluctant to anger the Americans at a time when the Chinese were seeking to be hosts for the 2008 Summer Games. Beijing lost by two votes to Sydney in a bid to host the 2000 Summer Games. Beijing might have also been concerned that the Chen case would attract increased scrutiny of human rights issues in the United States Congress at a time when China is seeking to enter the World Trade Organization, Olympic officials said. Sen. Diane Feinstein, the California Democrat, phoned the U.S.O.C. on Wednesday to inquire about the Chen case.</p>
        <p>Chen, 27, who lives in Escondido, Calif., said yesterday in a statement: ''I always knew that once the Chinese Olympic Committee understood my situation clearly, they would change their mind. I will endeavor to do my absolute best, after which I will be happy to assist China in their 2008 Olympic bid.''</p>
        <p>Akers Makes Team</p>
        <p>Despite injury and illness, Michelle Akers will be back for another Olympic Games. Akers and 14 other soccer players from last year's World Cup champions were named yesterday to the team that will represent the United States next month in Sydney. Akers, 34, is the oldest member of the 18-player squad. Two other players recovering from injury, Carla Overbeck and Briana Scurry, also made the cut. (AP)</p>
