        <p>Jose Canseco limped across the clubhouse with an ice pack strapped across his left heel, more ice attached to his lower back, and probably would have lost a race to any of the young sons of Yankee players who were prancing around. But Canseco is not expected to run fast. He is expected to hit.</p>
        <p>Canseco did that in majestic fashion yesterday, blasting a homer into the upper deck in left field in his first start with the Yankees. The ball soared off Canseco's bat, caromed off the facade and traveled more than 400 feet. Somewhere, General Manager Brian Cashman smiled for a second or two.</p>

        <p>Jose Canseco limped across the clubhouse with an ice pack strapped across his left heel, more ice attached to his lower back, and probably would have lost a race to any of the young sons of Yankee players who were prancing around. But Canseco is not expected to run fast. He is expected to hit.</p>
        <p>Canseco did that in majestic fashion yesterday, blasting a homer into the upper deck in left field in his first start with the Yankees. The ball soared off Canseco's bat, caromed off the facade and traveled more than 400 feet. Somewhere, General Manager Brian Cashman smiled for a second or two.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are stuck with Canseco after putting a waiver claim in on him last week, so Manager Joe Torre will try to provide at-bats for Canseco, who is the same type of player as Glenallen Hill. Torre started Hill in left field and made Canseco the designated hitter yesterday and, voila, both players drilled homers in the fourth inning. Canseco's first with the Yankees was much more impressive than Hill's fifth, which looked like a soft fly ball before it drifted into the right-field bleachers.</p>
        <p>''I was just thinking, 'Don't try to do too much,' '' Canseco said. ''Just do what you do. You've been at it for 15 years.' ''</p>
        <p>''It was really nice to see that today,'' Torre said. ''That sort of made him feel really needed.''</p>
        <p>Canseco, who has 441 career homers, casually said that he had previously smashed a homer into the same spot in left. But Canseco quickly turned serious when he admitted that he was ''definitely nervous'' when he pinch-hit on Tuesday in his first at-bat as a Yankee and popped out with the bases loaded.</p>
        <p>''Everything is going so fast,'' Canseco said. ''I'm not only trying to get acclimated to playing for the Yankees, but possibly to a new role.''</p>
        <p>Even though Canseco had the homer, a double and two sacrifice flies, he said he understood that the two extra-base hits and three runs batted in did not guarantee him a start tonight against the Angels. But  Canseco will, in fact, start at Anaheim. Torre will rest David Justice against Scott Schoeneweis and keep Canseco and Hill in the lineup for a second straight game. Still, Canseco will probably return to being a pinch-hitter tomorrow.</p>
        <p>''I've never been in this role before,'' Canseco said.</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill, who was rested yesterday so Torre could get Hill and Canseco into the lineup, was in the clubhouse in the fourth inning when he heard a roar. O'Neill hustled to the dugout but only saw Canseco lumbering around the bases. Then O'Neill peered toward the upper deck in left field and understood what he had missed.</p>
        <p>''I didn't see him hit it, but I saw where it went,'' O'Neill said. ''I was like, 'Oh, man, I missed it.' I'm just like a fan. I want to see him hit.''</p>
