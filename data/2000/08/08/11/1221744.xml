        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday pledged $10 million to help Yonkers end 14 years of federal control of its school system imposed by a court-ordered desegregation plan.</p>
        <p>The governor characterized the money as a good-faith gesture to try to prompt agreement among the state, the city, minority groups and the courts on a settlement in the case, which has roiled the city politically for the better part of two decades.</p>
        <p>The school system, the state's fourth largest, is effectively desegregated, with 75 percent minority students, compared with 35 percent when the Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled in 1986 that the schools were segregated. But the city still has to convince the courts that it is providing enough resources to minority students.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mayor John D. Spencer, the school board and the head of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which brought the original desegregation suit against the city, stood with the governor as he made his promise, and agreed to work together.</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki said the money would be the first installment in a multiyear financial settlement to be negotiated over the next few months. The court and the State Legislature must approve the settlement before the desegregation case can be closed.</p>
        <p>''What the governor wants to do is provide real momentum so we can get all sides together,'' said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki.</p>
        <p>The city's mayor and school board have pushed for the end of federal control for several years, and in June fired the schools superintendent, Andre J. Hornsby, largely because he had battled those efforts.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby, the city's first black schools superintendent, said the district still showed vestiges of segregation, which, under the court order, would require continued federal monitoring. Continuing the case would also require the state to pay $47 million for programs aimed at improving the performance of minority students.</p>
        <p>The state cut that money after the city decided not to appeal a court ruling last summer that said the schools were free of racial segregation. Dr. Hornsby said the cut would result in a $34 million deficit in the schools budget.</p>
        <p>School board members and the mayor said they wanted to be free of the stigma of the desegregation case. Rather than go through the courts to fill the budget gap, they said, they preferred to negotiate with the state.</p>
        <p>The governor's office said it would insist that any settlement require the city to make a minimum financial contribution as a condition of receiving the money from the state.</p>
        <p>Already, the governor's office said, Yonkers has received $133 million for its schools in the 2000-2001 state budget, a 15.4 percent increase from the previous year, compared with an average increase of 8.7 percent statewide. On June 23, the state approved $9.5 million in interest-free loans and grants to help Yonkers make up the budget shortfall.</p>
        <p>At yesterday's news conference, the city's interim superintendent, Joseph Farmer, said the money the governor committed would cover any remaining budget gap.</p>
