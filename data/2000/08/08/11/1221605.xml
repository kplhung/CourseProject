        <p>BRIDGEHAMPTON CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL. Generally speaking, musicians who want to combine music making and vacation time seem drawn to the woods and the mountains. The flutist Marya Martin gambled that her colleagues would be equally happy to perform in range of a beach, and the bet has paid off: she has regularly attracted fine players to her festival in Bridgehampton, where she has offered some inventive programs. This weekend's concerts look at intersections of classical and popular forms. Tomorrow Ms. Martin and her colleagues begin with the Suite No. 2 for Flute and Jazz Piano by the French composer Claude Bolling. The rest of the program is devoted to works of various kinds -- that is, not just tangos -- by Astor Piazzola. The Sunday program, in which Audra MacDonald is the vocal soloist, focuses partly on music with theatrical connections, and partly on personal introspection. It includes selections from ''Myths and Hymns'' by the promising young theater composer Adam Guettel, as well as Michael Kamen's ''Prayer'' and Paul Moravec's ''Mood Swings.'' Tomorrow and Sunday at 6:30 p.m., the Bridgehampton Presbyterian Church, Montauk Highway, on Long Island, (631) 537-6368. Tickets: $25, $20 for seniors (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>CARAMOOR FESTIVAL. As most followers of classical music know, for some 30 years an injury to the pianist Leon Fleisher's right hand forced him to give up his career as a two-handed pianist, though he did play repertory for the left hand and began conducting actively. But in the early 1990's, as Mr. Fleisher's rehabilitation progressed, he began performing again with both hands. In recent years he has been doing so quite a bit and extremely well, though he has tried not to call too much attention to his activities. Tonight at the Caramoor Festival in Katonah, N.Y., Mr. Fleisher will perform Brahms's Piano Quartet No. 1 with the Caramoor Virtuosi, young participants (past and present) in the festival's Rising Stars Workshops. This collaboration is most fitting, since Mr. Fleisher is one of America's most respected teachers. The program includes chamber works by Mozart and Schulhoff. Tomorrow the festival concludes with a concert by the Caramoor Virtuosi Orchestra with Peter Oundjian conducting. The program offers works by Bach, Bartok and Mozart's Piano Concerto in A (K. 414) with Mr. Fleisher as the soloist. Caramoor Virtuosi, with Leon Fleisher, pianist: tonight at 8, the Spanish Courtyard; tickets: $25. Caramoor Virtuosi Orchestra, tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., the Venetian Theater; tickets: $15 to $45. Caramoor Festival, Katonah, N.Y. Directions and ticket information: (914) 232-5035 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>MARLBORO FESTIVAL. Part festival, part training camp for aspiring and accomplished young musicians from Curtis, Juilliard and other conservatories, Marlboro has a special atmosphere of collegiality and love of the art. The current season is its 50th, and it has a lot to celebrate, not least the stewardship of its new co-directors, the exceptional pianists Richard Goode and Mitsuko Uchida. In its public concerts, faculty and students share the stands in most of the ensembles. This is the final weekend of the festival season, and the three programs offered are quite varied. The most traditional is tonight's, which includes Dvorak's Quartet in G (Op. 106), a stunning piece that is too rarely played; Ravel's Introduction and Allegro; Janacek's wind sextet ''Mladi''; and works by Schumann and Debussy. Tomorrow's concert begins with ''Arcadiana,'' a string quartet by  Thomas Ades, Marlboro's resident composer, and also includes a Haydn Piano Trio and Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire'' with Carola Gunther as the vocalist. Another of Mr Ades's works, ''Catch,'' is to be heard on Sunday, along with the Dvorak Serenade, a Divertimento by Marlboro's founder, Adolf Busch, and a Mendelssohn Octet. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Marlboro Music Festival, Marlboro, Vt., (802) 254-2394. Tickets: $5 to $25 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>MAVERICK CONCERTS. This enterprising chamber music series, now in its 85th season, offers concerts in an open-sided barn where the sounds of nature and the music of man interact freely. This weekend's programming touches on the antique and the modern. Tomorrow evening the Ensemble for Early Music offers a program called ''Pilgrimage: Cathedrals and Abbeys of Europe,'' with works composed in Paris; Limoges, France; and Santiago de Compostela, Spain, as well as works by the great abbess-composer Hildegarde of Bingen. On Sunday the Juilliard Quartet will play ''Officum Breve'' by the Hungarian composer Gyorgy Kurtag on a program that also includes quartets by Haydn (Op. 64, No. 1) and Brahms (Op. 51, No. 2). Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m. Maverick Concerts, Maverick Road between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., just outside Woodstock. (914) 679-8217 Tickets: $15, $5 for students (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL. This event, popular from its inception 34 years ago, has evolved to supplement the familiar orchestral concerts with all manner of other programs, including, in this Bach year, a Bach celebration. But the fare here is the orchestral tried and (one hopes) true, as Joseph Swensen makes his Mostly Mozart debut as a conductor. Mr. Swensen, a sometime violinist, looks at the concerto from the other end, leading the festival orchestra in Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 3, with Leonidas Kavakos as soloist, and Piano Concerto No. 23, with Ivan Moravec as soloist. Works by Boccherini and Beethoven fill out the program, and as a bonus, Mr. Moravec plays works of Haydn and Chopin in a preconcert recital at 7. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $45 (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>NORFOLK CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL. The Yale Summer School of Music retreats north to this lovely spot, and the public reaps much of the benefit at concerts in the quaint Music Shed. Tonight the festival offers a Copland centennial celebration with performers including Joan Panetti, a pianist and the festival director, and Richard Lalli, a baritone. Tomorrow, the Vermeer Quartet plays string quartets by Haydn and Tchaikovsky, and Boris Berman lavishes his talents on the rudimentary piano part in Schnittke's stirring Piano Quintet. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860) 542-3000. Tickets: $12 to $36; $5 for ages 18 to 25; free to those under 18 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>SARATOGA CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL. It's Russian music this weekend at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, where the Philadelphia Orchestra performs in its summer residency. Tonight Charles Dutoit conducts a program called ''Magic Russia,'' which offers Liadov's ''Enchanted Lake,'' Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade'' and Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 3, though what is specifically enchanted about the Prokofiev is not immediately clear. Count on the soloist, the exciting young violinist Vadim Repin, to enchant you. Tomorrow night's program is called ''Spectacular Russia,'' though it might have been called ''Tchaikovsky's Greatest Hits.'' The program, again with Mr. Dutoit conducting, includes the ''1812'' Overture, a suite from ''Swan Lake,'' and the Piano Concerto No. 1, with the remarkable pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet as soloist. On Sunday afternoon the Saratoga Chamber Music Festival presents a Young Artists Concert, with musicians from the Curtis Institute of Music playing works by Copland, Chopin and Schubert. The Philadelphia Orchestra: ''Magic Russia'' tonight at 8:15 and ''Spectacular Russia'' tomorrow at 8:15, with Charles Dutoit conducting, the Saratoga Performing Arts Center; tickets are $20-$50, $13 for lawn seats. Sunday at 2:15 p.m.; Young Artists Concert at the Saratoga Chamber Music Festival, the Spa Little Theater. Tickets $27.50, $22.50 For ticket information and directions, call the center's box office: (518) 587-3330 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>SKANEATELES FESTIVAL. As many other festivals wind down, it may be time to dig out the map and start exploring. Tucked away in Skaneateles, near Syracuse, this event is directed by Diane Walsh, a pianist. Tonight Ms. Walsh joins other performers in chamber works by Dvorak, Martinu and Smetana. Tomorrow Miriam Burns conducts the festival orchestra in symphonies by Boyce and Mozart, and Tchaikovsky's popular Serenade for Strings. Tonight at 8, St. James Episcopal Church, East Genesee Street; tomorrow night at 8, Brook Farm, Route 41A, south of Skaneateles, N.Y., (315) 685-7418. Tickets: tonight, $10 to $16; tomorrow, $15 and $20; free to those under 13 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>TANGLEWOOD FESTIVAL. Unexpectedly, Hans Graf, an Austrian conductor who specializes in Mozart, unearths a work from the recent American past tonight, leading the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Peter Mennin's ''Moby Dick'' from 1952. Mr. Graf's program, otherwise thoroughly mainstream, also offers Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, with Andre Watts as soloist, and Mendelssohn's ''Scottish'' Symphony. On Sunday the rising American maestro Robert Spano leads the orchestra in more recent Americana, Elliott Carter's Variations for Orchestra, as part of the Tanglewood Music Center's Festival of Contemporary Music. He, too, finishes out with standard works, by Prokofiev (the First Violin Concerto, with Vladimir Repin as soloist) and Mozart. Meanwhile, on Saturday, another American, Andre Previn, takes the Austrian straight and narrow, conducting the Boston Symphony in a program of Mozart, with the orchestra's splendid principal flutist, Jacques Zoon, as soloist in the Flute Concerto in G. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass., (413) 733-2500. Tickets: $14 (lawn) to $76 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>TANGLEWOOD MUSIC CENTER. To the contemporary-music world, the regular concerts of the Boston Symphony Orchestra at the Tanglewood Festival, with their heavy concentration on mainstream repertory, are largely a nonevent. But all ears perk up when the contingent of gifted younger performers on campus offers their Festival of Contemporary Music. This year, the English composer and conductor George Benjamin directs the event, with a concentration on American music. On Sunday evening, alumni of the center offer Pierre Boulez's ''Sur Incises,'' celebrating the composer's 75th birthday and the center's 60th anniversary. Today and tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. (with prelude concerts at 1), and Sunday at 10 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., Seiji Ozawa Hall, Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass., (617) 266-1492. Admission: suggested donation of $6 (Oestreich).</p>
