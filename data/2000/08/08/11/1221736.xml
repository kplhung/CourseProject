        <p>President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia accepted the resignation of his chief economic minister, Kwik Kian Gie, left, who said he was stepping aside to give the president a free hand in naming a new cabinet. Mr. Kwik, a key political aide to Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri, had been under criticism for his economic management since he became part of Mr. Wahid's first cabinet eight months ago. Under intense criticism for his style of leadership and in particular for his economic management, Mr. Wahid has announced he will name a new, more professional, governing team.</p>
