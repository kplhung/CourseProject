        <p>The boisterous cries on behalf of New York City's lowly consumers were heard from the Bronx to the Battery yesterday.</p>
        <p>From the steps of City Hall to outside Madison Square Garden, city officials at separate news conferences championed consumer rights, wagging fingers at businesses that defraud or dupe their customers.</p>
        <p>For the city's public advocate, Mark Green, the targets were the city's top three energy suppliers, which he accused of anticompetitive practices. For Assemblyman Jeffrey Klein of the Bronx, the cause was unsanitary supermarkets: he wants Gov. George E. Pataki to sign a bill that would make it easier for the state to shut down food stores that have failed inspections.</p>
        <p>At Evergreen Videos, a small family-owned video store in Greenwich Village, the city's consumer affairs commissioner, Jane S. Hoffman, released a survey on the average price of a movie rental in the city. Ms. Hoffman said she chose the location because the store had one of the lowest rental prices in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>And not to be outdone, the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, denounced the rising cost of entertainment, from movies to sports tickets. He singled out the Knicks, whose games can cost as much as $220 per person.</p>
        <p>For the individual officials, it was business as usual, but for all of them to jump on the consumer-protection trolley on the same day?</p>
        <p>''People say consumers need a voice -- hey, they had plenty today,'' said Steve Sigmund, a spokesman for Mr. Green.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for the officials said the sudden convergence of consumer advocacy was sheer coincidence.</p>
        <p>''We didn't plan any of this to happen all at once,'' said Michael Schlank, a spokesman for Mr. Klein. ''I guess we're all just concerned about the welfare of the people in this city.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schlank said that the assemblyman had no choice but to schedule his news conference yesterday, because Mr. Klein planned to fly to Los Angeles this weekend for the Democratic National Convention.</p>
        <p>But in hushed tones, some spokesmen for the officials said there were other reasons for the sudden surge in consumer interests.</p>
        <p>''It's the summer, and news is slow,'' a spokeswoman said. ''Friday's generally a bad day to break news because no one reads the Saturday papers, so Thursday it was. And consumer advocacy always gets everyone's wheels turning.''</p>
        <p>Regardless, the city officials put on their sternest faces and said ''tsk, tsk'' to consumer-unfriendly industries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone took up the cause of the average New Yorker who simply wants to see a movie or a basketball game.</p>
        <p>''New York is becoming so expensive that many families can't afford to go to the movies or even out for ice cream,'' Mr. Vallone said. ''It is unacceptable that during this economic boom, basic entertainment is beyond the reach of working people.''</p>
        <p>With furrowed brow, Mr. Klein released a list of what he called the city's 10 worst supermarkets, some of which he said had sold contaminated foods that included rat droppings.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hoffman held up a copy of ''Casablanca'' as she told New Yorkers that renting a movie should not be ''risky business.'' She warned New Yorkers to look out for unusually high late fees or exorbitant membership costs.</p>
        <p>At City Hall, Mr. Green said that deregulation of energy suppliers had driven up costs for consumers.</p>
        <p>''Because there is excessive demand and inadequate supply, deregulation has forced consumers and businesses to end up paying millions of extra dollars for power this summer,'' he said.</p>
