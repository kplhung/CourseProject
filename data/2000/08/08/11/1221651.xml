        <p>More than 170 speakers of legislatures around the world plan to meet here for the first time later this month to celebrate a little-noticed byproduct of the spread of democracy: the growth and strengthening of national parliaments.</p>
        <p>To the chagrin of the organizers, however, no one from the United States Congress seems willing to attend.</p>
        <p>Since 1996, the Republican-led Congress has failed to pay its dues to the group that organized the meeting, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which Americans helped to found in 1889. An invitation to preside over part of the meeting was sent to J. Dennis Hastert, the Illinois Republican who is speaker of the House of Representatives. It has not been answered. No one can make it from the Senate side either, officials of the Inter-Parliamentary Union said.</p>
        <p>''I think that they should be there,'' said Anders B. Johnsson, a Swede who is secretary general of the group. ''I think the world wants them to be there. We've sent that message. But we haven't got a response. I think that's a shame.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnsson, an administrator based in Geneva, and Najma Heptullah, the speaker of India's upper house, who is now president of the parliamentary union, both tried to meet American legislators to persuade them to attend the meeting and play a part in strengthening the work of national legislatures. Ms. Heptullah waited in vain in New York for two weeks for an appointment with Mr. Hastert in Washington, union officials said.</p>
        <p>An official on Mr. Johnsson's staff, frustrated by repeated snubs from Washington, called Congress ''the rudest parliament in the world, without a doubt.'' He described the atmosphere on Capitol Hill as fortresslike and ''run by aides who are the age of my children.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, John Feehery, the House speaker's spokesman, said that Mr. Hastert could not attend the meeting because he would be traveling in Colombia with President Clinton at the end of August. ''This is the worst time of the year for us, toward the end of the August recess,'' he said. ''This is a very contentious political year, and the speaker is going to be spending most of his time campaigning.''</p>
        <p>If Congress does not resume paying its dues, about $900,000 a year, it will be suspended from the Inter-Parliamentary Union in October and expelled next year, oddly, at a meeting scheduled to be held in Havana.</p>
        <p>National legislatures have growing roles to play in a global age, parliamentary union officials and members say. Legislatures have the power to regulate the uses of national resources, and protect countries from exploitation in an era of economic globalization. They ratify treaties and debate international policies. Domestically, they can protect rights, raise tax revenues and guide social policies so that spending reaches the poor. Functioning legislatures aid development.</p>
        <p>When Secretary General Kofi Annan travels abroad, said Santiago Romero-Perez, director of the Inter-Parliamentary Union's liaison office with the United Nations, ''he makes it a point of visiting parliaments.''</p>
        <p>''This is not a chance happening,'' Mr. Romero added, ''but a realization that the big commitments made during the 1990's really need a popular response. Parliaments have to legislate and appropriate the funds.''</p>
        <p>In Geneva, Mr. Johnsson said that many parliaments still needed work.</p>
        <p>''If you look at the last decade -- the 1990's, the one that history will remember as a period of democratization in the world -- one country out of every four in the world changed its constitutional framework, its electoral law, its parliament.'' he said. ''In all of those, there were two elements in common. One is that they introduced multiparty systems, and the other was that they introduced a stronger parliament with real legislative and oversight functions.''</p>
        <p>National parliaments, he said, are a natural link between the grass roots and the wider world, including the international economic institutions that have become targets of criticism in the third world.</p>
        <p>''Many people in many parts of the world feel that they are completely disconnected from the real decision-making processes on the international scene,'' Mr. Johnsson said. ''That is a great concern. If they don't feel that these are their processes and that they have an influence over them, then these processes may be destroyed. That we cannot afford.''</p>
