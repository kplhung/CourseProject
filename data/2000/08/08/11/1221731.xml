        <p>Four thousand church members bowed their heads today and prayed for a sinner in their midst -- a man who, like them, was struggling in his life with right and wrong.</p>
        <p>''Guide his path,'' intoned Bill Hybels, senior pastor at the Willow Creek Community Church here. ''Fill him with your wisdom and cause him to keep growing personally and maturing.''</p>
        <p>The man before them was President Clinton, and he had just described how his life had spun out of control after an adulterous affair, how his job sometimes overwhelmed him, how the past seven and a half years had had low moments and wonderful ones, too.</p>
        <p>''If you're not careful when you have this kind of job, it can overtake you,'' the president said wistfully, sitting on a swivel chair on a stage in an enormous church. ''You can believe it's even more important than it is. You can let it take up even more time than it should. It can crowd out all that other stuff that keeps you centered and growing and whole.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has reflected on his impeachment before, and he has discussed his religious beliefs throughout his presidency. But his reflections today amounted to a live public interview on the personal travails of his presidency, conducted by a pastor who has counseled him regularly since 1992.</p>
        <p>And he went out of his way to give credit to Vice President Al Gore for the administration's successes and to insist that Mr. Gore should not be blamed for Mr. Clinton's personal failings.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't get enough credit for what we did together that is good and, surely, no fair-minded person would blame him for any mistake that I made,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I'm now in the second year of a process of trying to totally rebuild my life from a terrible mistake I made,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>His appearance at the church came at a delicate time, just a few days before the Democrats are to open their political convention in Los Angeles and shift the spotlight from Mr. Clinton to Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Gore have expressed their annoyance that Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, plan such a high profile at the convention, and the president's headline-grabbing remarks here on the eve of the convention could add to their annoyance, even if they are grateful to Mr. Clinton for his praise today for the Vice President.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Gore campaign continued to express frustration over the repeated dredging up of Mr. Clinton's affair -- already back in the news because Mr. Gore's vice-presidential pick, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, had criticized Mr. Clinton so openly about it.</p>
        <p>One Gore adviser observed drily, ''We're trying to keep the focus on the future and on the issues that matter to the voters, and this isn't in that category.''</p>
        <p>Another Gore aide said the campaign hoped that the selection of Mr. Lieberman, the first Democratic senator to chastise the president openly, would underscore that the ticket was separate from the president and also that the president's comments clearly reflected that his affair had been his own problem.</p>
        <p>White House aides said there was no political calculation in sandwiching the president's confessional between an educational event in Chicago and an evening in New York City for Mrs. Clinton's Senate bid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton had promised Mr. Hybels, who described himself as the president's ''behind-the-scenes spiritual adviser,'' that before he left office he would appear at one of Mr. Hybels's leadership conferences, which draw pastors and other church leaders from around the world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's appearance at the religious retreat had been contentious. Some conservative pastors had opposed the visit and had insisted that Mr. Hybels not go easy in his questioning of Mr. Clinton in his missteps. And Mr. Hybels, in a sympathetic way, obliged.</p>
        <p>He asked about the president's dog, Buddy. He asked about the issues the president cares most about and how he wants to be remembered. But he asked as well about Mr. Clinton's brush with impeachment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's face appeared on two large screens in the church auditorium, the kind of close-up that the television networks use to show the awkward, perspiration-inducing moments of an interview.</p>
        <p>''I think I have given evidence that I need to be in church,'' Mr. Clinton said at one point, referring to the fallout from what he called ''my personal crisis.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said he continues to rebuild his life after his affair with a White House intern, and he said he continued to grapple with the state of his character and integrity.</p>
        <p>But he said he had also found a silver lining in the whole uncomfortable public airing of his missteps.</p>
        <p>''In a funny way, when you realize there's nothing left to hide, it sort of frees you up to do what you ought to do anyway,'' the president said of his counseling sessions.</p>
        <p>He said the embarrassing episode had humbled him, and he encouraged other politicians to seek spiritual advisers to guide them throughout the pressures of public office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said that even presidents had to realize that they were flawed, both as politicians and policymakers. ''I am quite sure that some of my positions are wrong,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The impeachment episode aside, Mr. Clinton said the lowest moment of his presidency came when he learned that 18 American soldiers were killed in a military action he had ordered in Somalia.</p>
        <p>''I felt the sickest I have been since I have been here,'' he said, adding that all military actions were a strain on him. ''You know the chances are some of them are going to die.'' And even if American soldiers do not die, they are likely to kill someone else, he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton rattled off far more positive recollections from his presidency -- legislation that had passed, foreign policy successes, standing with Nelson Mandela in the prison cell where he had spent so much of his life. And Mr. Clinton said he would miss the ups -- and even the downs -- of being president.</p>
        <p>More than riding on Air Force One or hearing ''Hail to the Chief'' when he walked into a room, or waking up every morning in the White House, Mr. Clinton said, ''what I will miss more than anything else is the job.''</p>
