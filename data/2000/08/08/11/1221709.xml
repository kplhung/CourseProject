        <p>Turning to a second legal loophole after another was closed, one of the nation's largest unions, a leading supporter of Vice President Al Gore, has quietly created a group that this week is televising an advertisement harshly critical of Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Neither the group's ad nor its Web site (www.checkforyourself.com) discloses its relationship with the union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or Afscme.</p>
        <p>Afscme provided $800,000 to start the organization, American Family Voices. In a news release and on its Web site, the group describes its mission as advocacy of ''progressive policies, especially economic issues.'' It says its membership includes advocates for consumers, health care, education, children, the elderly, civil rights and labor.</p>
        <p>The organization was created in July, after Congress closed a loophole in federal tax and election law known as Section 527, under which groups were able, with virtually no disclosure, to raise and spend unlimited sums to spread political messages. American Family Voices was instead chartered under Section 501(c)4, a longstanding provision in the tax code that allows it to engage in political activity with minimal financial disclosure.</p>
        <p>Afscme, which has 1.3 million members, endorsed Vice President Gore last autumn, months before he sealed the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>The executive director of American Family Voices is Michael Lux, a longtime liberal campaigner who worked for two years in the Clinton  White House and has been affiliated with People for the American Way.</p>
        <p>The new effort makes organized labor the latest of a number of interests, as varied as the Sierra Club and the pharmaceutical industry, to set up independent groups to underwrite political advertising and other election-related activities.</p>
        <p>Under its Section 501(c)4 tax status, American Family Voices is permitted to engage in political activities like polling, lobbying and issue advertising but is not permitted to  advocate the election or defeat of individual candidates. Such groups must file public information returns with the Internal Revenue Service but are not required to disclose the sources of their income.</p>
        <p>They are reminiscent of secretive groups set up under Section 527. Sam Wyly, for instance, a wealthy benefactor of Mr. Bush, created a group called Republicans for Clean Air that ran television advertisements during the primaries attacking the environmental record of the Texas governor's chief rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona.</p>
        <p>In June, Congress passed legislation requiring Section 527 groups to disclose their major contributors and spending. American Family Voices was created after the legislation took effect on July 1, Mr. Lux said. As a result, it could not take advantage of the Section 527 nondisclosure loophole and will instead operate under the minimal-disclosure requirements of Section 501(c)4.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lux said he had raised $700,000 in addition to the sum provided by Afscme and intended to use the money this fall to buy issue advertising in the presidential campaign and selected Congressional races. He declined to identify the group's other contributors, saying only that they were organizations and individuals who shared the union's policy agenda for working people.</p>
        <p>The advertisement against Governor Bush, which is running this week in Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis and Washington, attacks him for vetoing patients' rights legislation, weakening nursing home regulations and opposing government-guaranteed prescription drug benefits under Medicare. It links his policies to large contributions from the insurance, nursing home and drug industries.</p>
        <p>Afscme's president, Gerald McEntee, said in an interview that American Family Voices was one of a number of independent political efforts that the union would undertake this fall on issues of importance to working families, including health care, education, the environment and taxes.</p>
        <p>Fred Wertheimer, an advocate of revisions in federal campaign law, said the union's hidden sponsorship of American Family Voices dramatized a longstanding problem in American politics.</p>
        <p>''Closing the Section 527 secrecy loophole just solved one of the problems,'' Mr. Wertheimer said. ''This is another example of interests' conducting blatant electioneering activities and hiding their donors. And it's a huge problem. This conduct is an evasion of the spirit of disclosure laws and will be a growing problem that will have to be solved just like the Section 527 groups were.''</p>
