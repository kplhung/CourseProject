        <p>Last Friday, Kendall Gill was so prepared to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers, he gushed about wearing purple and gold while playing alongside Shaquille O'Neal and the rest of the defending champions of the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>But after a week of self-doubt, family consultations, and high-powered phone calls from players and owners on both sides, Gill appears to have changed his mind, deciding that an extra $4.75 million was worth more than the promise of a championship ring.</p>
        <p>According to his agent, Arn Tellem, Gill is flying to New Jersey today to take a routine physical and re-sign with the Nets. He is expected to agree to a one-year deal worth $7 million, more than three times what the Lakers could offer him with their $2.25 million salary-cap exception.</p>
        <p>Tellem said that his client informed the Lakers yesterday that he was no longer interested in their deal, one that seemed nearly complete last week. Yesterday, Tellem informed the Nets' president Rod Thorn that Gill wanted to re-sign with the team.</p>
        <p>The Nets faxed the contract to Tellem, but did not get a response from Gill yesterday. Tellem said that Gill will sign the contract when he arrives at team headquarters. Gill could not be reached for comment last night, and Thorn was reluctant to discuss the matter because he did not have Gill's signature. ''It's not done right now, so I don't want to make any announcement,'' Thorn said.</p>
        <p>Gill, a 10-year veteran, had already changed his mind once.</p>
        <p>Later last night, Thorn said, ''If he shows and signs, then we'll have something to say about it.''</p>
        <p>But Tellem said nothing would stop this deal. ''The difference in money was compelling,'' Tellem said. ''He went back and forth. I think he felt that he was very excited about his opportunity with the Lakers. They were the only team he would have wanted to leave the Nets for. But given his security that this provides him with, it was just too compelling. It's a contract he couldn't turn down at this stage of his career.''</p>
        <p>But last week, the 32-year-old Gill did turn it down. And the Nets seemed to be in a bind. They had already lost their starting shooting guard, Kerry Kittles, for potentially the entire season as he recovers from knee surgery. The Nets envisioned Gill, who has played out of position at small forward for four and a half years, moving to his natural position, shooting guard.</p>
        <p>Last year, he averaged 13.1 points a game, just slightly below his career average.</p>
        <p>It was clear to the Nets, though, that Gill felt hurt by their public recruitment of the free-agent shooting guard Ron Mercer. Gill also felt miffed by the Nets' original $4 million offer, less than the $5.6 million he made last season. But he also rejected the Nets' second offer of $7 million, which he seems to have now accepted.</p>
        <p>''It was obvious he was sensitive to the fact that we were trying to sign another player in a position he felt he was going to be playing this year,'' Thorn said. ''But I've said all along that we wanted to sign him even if we signed somebody else.''</p>
        <p>When Mercer signed with the Bulls, New Jersey continued to explore other options, including sign-and-trade deals with the Lakers and Toronto. The Nets could not agree with the Lakers last week on a sign-and-trade deal for Gill, which would have paid him more than $2.25 million.</p>
        <p>Now the Nets need Gill to fill the gaping hole at shooting guard. And Gill is mollified by the contract.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The free agent AARON WILLIAMS, a soft-spoken 6-foot-9-inch backup power forward who played in Washington last year, was at Nets headquarters yesterday to sign a six-year deal worth $17 million -- a contract that, above all, offers him stability. He will play for his seventh N.B.A. team in seven years. Williams turned down the Knicks and the Washington Wizards for the Nets. ''The basketball opportunity here is very good,'' Williams said. ''The guys here are young. I thought this team had a very bright future. After six years, it made me feel good to finally feel that security. I have a lot of boxes -- it will nice to buy a house finally. I don't have to pack up after every season.'' Last season, Williams played 81 games and averaged 19.1 minutes a game.</p>
