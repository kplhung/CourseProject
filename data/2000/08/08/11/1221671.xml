        <p>The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, through a group it created called American Family Voices, has joined the political advertising wars with a 30-second television spot titled ''Invest.'' The advertisement takes George W. Bush to task for several decisions he has made as governor of Texas and tries to link them to large contributions to him and the Republican Party from the insurance, nursing home and drug industries. The slickly produced advertisement does not urge viewers to vote against Mr. Bush or for Vice President Al Gore, but asks them to call Mr. Bush's office or visit the sponsoring group's Web site.</p>

        <p>The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, through a group it created called American Family Voices, has joined the political advertising wars with a 30-second television spot titled ''Invest.'' The advertisement takes George W. Bush to task for several decisions he has made as governor of Texas and tries to link them to large contributions to him and the Republican Party from the insurance, nursing home and drug industries. The slickly produced advertisement does not urge viewers to vote against Mr. Bush or for Vice President Al Gore, but asks them to call Mr. Bush's office or visit the sponsoring group's Web site.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Axelrod &amp; Associates.  ON THE SCREEN -- A hand-held camera pans the confetti-strewn floor of a darkened arena after the Republican convention. The camera pauses at posters that list the size of campaign contributions from various industries to Mr. Bush and Republican committees. The spot closes with text giving the telephone number of Mr. Bush's office in Austin, Tex., and the Web address of American Family Voices.</p>
        <p>SCRIPT -- ''The convention's over,'' a narrator says.  ''And look who won. The insurance industry; they've invested millions in George W. Bush, who vetoed a patients' bill of rights in Texas. Nursing home operators; they've given over a hundred thousand to Bush, who weakened nursing home laws in Texas, while patient complaints doubled. The big drug companies; they've kicked in millions for Bush, who joined them in opposing guaranteed Medicare prescription coverage. Tell Bush when special interests win, America's families lose.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The advertisement gives big numbers for industry contributions to Mr. Bush ($4.3 million from the insurance industry, $2.3 million from drug companies), but they include large soft-money donations to Republican Party committees and  smaller donations to the Bush campaign. The advertisement's other assertions are based on newspaper articles and are oversimplified but not false, although Mr. Bush has not opposed Medicare prescription drug coverage but only insisted that the benefit not be fully financed by taxpayers.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- With this spot, the labor movement and liberal interests are putting Mr. Bush and other Republicans on notice that they will conduct an aggressive negative campaign on economic issues this fall. Unions have budgeted millions of dollars for this and similar efforts that will support Democratic candidates around the country.</p>
