        <p>GREGORY JAVAN MILLS is talking about the collection he has spent 20 years assembling: 5,000 films starring black actors or made by black producers and directors. There is ''Tamango,'' with Dorothy Dandridge as a slave who has a love affair with her master.  There is ''Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads,'' an early film by Spike Lee.

        <p>GREGORY JAVAN MILLS is talking about the collection he has spent 20 years assembling: 5,000 films starring black actors or made by black producers and directors. There is ''Tamango,'' with Dorothy Dandridge as a slave who has a love affair with her master.  There is ''Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads,'' an early film by Spike Lee. There is ''Harlem Rides the Range,'' an all-black western from the 1940's.</p>
        <p>So what are the prized possessions in Mr. Mills's collection at the New York State Black Film Archive?</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't call them possessions,'' he stammers, then begs, ''You have to phrase it another way.''</p>
        <p>He is sitting in a film and video classroom in the Adam Clayton Powell State Office Building on 125th Street in Harlem. A Bell &amp; Howell projector so old that it looks like an antique refrigerator, with a door that flaps open if it is not latched, sits on a coffee table. The machine was built for the military, it turns out. But it is not his prized possession. Finally, Mr. Mills decides that his prized possession is ''the ability to steer this organization on the right path.''</p>
        <p>And there it is: unreconstituted artspeak, or rather, arts administrator-speak, that falls so easily from the tongues of the type of executive director whose job includes running the projector and making the popcorn. Mr. Mills talks as if he is writing a grant, or perhaps has written too many: careful, measured and heavy on what some might call truisms. ''There's always room for improvement,'' he says after being asked if things are better for black artists now than in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>At the Harlem Week 2000 Black Film Festival, which ends on Sunday, Mr. Mills is showing films that have not been screened in half a century or more. They are drawn from his archive, which he describes as the largest collection of black films. Mr. Mills's films are stored in the basement of the office building and in other places, including his apartment, the studio in Harlem where he has lived, alone, since he moved to Manhattan in the 1970's. ''I'm like Duke Ellington: this is what I do, this is my family. Duke Ellington said, 'Music is my mistress.' ''</p>
        <p>But collecting movies was an ordeal at first. In the early 1980's, Mr. Mills would set up a table outside the New York Public Library, offering information about his organization. The idea was, once people came up to the table, they would slip some change into the donation jar. He ended up with more than money: he met film collectors from Brooklyn, who provided the reels for the first Black Film Festival, in 1985. The collaboration was, in Mr. Mills's terms, ''an opportunity to bring Manhattan and Brooklyn together.''</p>
        <p>But the collectors did not volunteer to help him build a collection. ''I would say, 'How do you get this stuff?' They would say, 'We got the connections.' ''</p>
        <p>MR. MILLS, 48, did not start off with much of an interest in film, although as a child in Winston-Salem, N.C., he loved Bette Davis. And he remembers overhearing his mother, a public-school dietitian, talk about Dorothy Dandridge's death (in 1965, at 42, of an overdose of prescription drugs). His father worked on cars. ''I don't think I wanted to work in the cafeteria or be a mechanic,'' he says, ''so I became an artist.''</p>
        <p>A painter, to be specific. He spent a few years in the Air Force (his ''Peter Max period,'' he calls it; he painted a psychedelic mural for the noncommissioned officers' club at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota). Then, thanks to the G.I. Bill, he moved to New York and enrolled at the School of Visual Arts. He still quotes Oscar Wilde and Jimi Hendrix like an ardent student.</p>
        <p>Here is something he says the professors did not teach him at the school: in the 1970's, New York galleries would not show ''black art,'' and that included abstract paintings by a black artist, namely, him. Here is something they did teach him there: artists start schools of thought, like Bauhaus, the Ash Can School and Dada. So, at school, he decided to start a ''school of thought for artists of color.'' One of his first projects was to help a fellow student whose photographs of children playing in Harlem had been declared ''unaesthetic'' at Visual Arts. His letters of protest led the administration to reconsider, and the student got the degree that had been hanging in the balance. A panel discussion on race and the arts, the first of many, followed.</p>
        <p>In the early 80's, Mr. Mills saw a public television segment on Oscar Micheaux, who made films in the early 20's and 30's about black life and who was nicknamed the Midnight Rambler because he often rented white movie theaters after midnight to show his films. Mr. Mills knew nothing about the man.</p>
        <p>That's the way of things. Know nothing, start a film festival. Fortunately, Mr. Mills and Ernest Steele, who became the archivist, found -- without the help of the Brooklyn collectors -- the Donnell Library Center in Midtown Manhattan, which houses the city's film archives. They spent days researching distributors and collectors and building a network of people who would alert them when rare prints came on the market.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, worried that the recession was hurting support of the arts in Harlem, he considered quitting. ''I thought, 'Let's have an auction, sell off everything, everyone go back to their first love.' '' Then another grant came through, and changed his mind.</p>
