        <p>When last year's 30th-anniversary incarnation of the Woodstock festival ended in a welter of mayhem, sexual abuse and overall bad vibes, a few commentators chided the Limp Bizkit generation for falling so far from the ideals that had supposedly inspired the original festival. But the betrayal of the peace, love and flowers ethic, according to one of the 60's enduring myths, didn't require three decades. Less than six months after the first Woodstock, the first -- and definitive -- anti-Woodstock took place in December 1969 at the Altamont Motor Speedway, outside of San Francisco, where the Rolling Stones concluded their North American tour with a hastily organized free concert.</p>
        <p>It had been someone's idea -- the Grateful Dead, a few sources reported -- to entrust the security of the stage to the Bay Area Hell's Angels, who, fueled by free beer, practiced crowd control with fists and pool cues. As the Stones struck up ''Sympathy for the Devil,'' skirmishes broke out at the edge of the stage, and as they played ''Under My Thumb,'' a young black man named Meredith Hunter was stabbed to death, apparently after pulling a gun in the course of a scuffle. All of this was captured on film by the cameras of David and Albert Maysles, Charlotte Zwerin and their crew. The filmmakers had been given unusual access to the band, and their documentary about the events leading up to Altamont -- ''Gimme Shelter'' -- has long been considered one of the best rock 'n' roll movies of all time.</p>

        <p>When last year's 30th-anniversary incarnation of the Woodstock festival ended in a welter of mayhem, sexual abuse and overall bad vibes, a few commentators chided the Limp Bizkit generation for falling so far from the ideals that had supposedly inspired the original festival. But the betrayal of the peace, love and flowers ethic, according to one of the 60's enduring myths, didn't require three decades. Less than six months after the first Woodstock, the first -- and definitive -- anti-Woodstock took place in December 1969 at the Altamont Motor Speedway, outside of San Francisco, where the Rolling Stones concluded their North American tour with a hastily organized free concert.</p>
        <p>It had been someone's idea -- the Grateful Dead, a few sources reported -- to entrust the security of the stage to the Bay Area Hell's Angels, who, fueled by free beer, practiced crowd control with fists and pool cues. As the Stones struck up ''Sympathy for the Devil,'' skirmishes broke out at the edge of the stage, and as they played ''Under My Thumb,'' a young black man named Meredith Hunter was stabbed to death, apparently after pulling a gun in the course of a scuffle. All of this was captured on film by the cameras of David and Albert Maysles, Charlotte Zwerin and their crew. The filmmakers had been given unusual access to the band, and their documentary about the events leading up to Altamont -- ''Gimme Shelter'' -- has long been considered one of the best rock 'n' roll movies of all time.</p>
        <p>Now, thanks to the release of an immaculate 35-millimeter print, with impressive Dolby Digital Sound, you can judge for yourself. The Altamont festival itself is a faded legend of a still-contested era, but the Maysles brothers' documentary method -- cinema verite, direct cinema, whatever you want to call it -- is pointedly anti-mythical.</p>
        <p>''Gimme Shelter'' is too rigorously empirical to shed light on a gaseous abstraction called the 60's, or even to capture the nebulous spirit of the cultural curiosity called rock 'n' roll. Instead, the film illuminates, with a mordant, gimlet-eyed wit, a hectic period in the working lives of a group of musicians. It's also a portrait of a vain, charismatic rock star -- Mick Jagger -- who seems alternately in full command of his demonic power and appalled by it.</p>
        <p>The movie is framed by a series of scenes of the Stones' watching themselves in the editing room, as though in thrall to the images they are laboring to create. ''Rubbish,'' sneers Mr. Jagger, hearing himself utter some platitudes about the free concert creating ''a microcosm'' of a new, harmonious society. Later, trying to quell the violence at Altamont, he pleads, ''If we are all one, let's show we're all one,'' and you can't help but marvel at the cynicism. One what? Rarely has the schism between performers and their fans -- the few who arrive by helicopter and the many who walk, hitchhike and are left to wander home dazed and lost the morning after -- been so explicit.</p>
        <p>But rarely have the glories of the music -- or the dimensions of Mr. Jagger's prancing, Byronic persona -- seemed so convincing. Onstage at Madison Square Garden in a red silk scarf and an Uncle Sam top hat, Mr. Jagger scrambles racial and sexual codes with a subversive brio that prophesies everyone from Prince to Sandra Bernhard. And Tina Turner, one of the Stones' opening acts on the tour, achieves a level of intimacy with a microphone that might have earned ''Gimme Shelter'' an NC-17 rating. If you only know Mr. Jagger and Ms. Turner in their more recent incarnations, as ambassadors of a comfortable, official, middle-aged pop culture, you owe it to yourself, and to them, to witness them in their young and dangerous prime.</p>
        <p>''Gimme Shelter'' is at the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village. Tickets: $9; $5 for members. Box office: (212) 727-8110.</p>
