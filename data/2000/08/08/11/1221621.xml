        <p>BUMPER-TO-BUMPER warranties are a given. Bumper-to-bumper free speech is not.</p>
        <p>In some places, coarse language on bumper stickers can cause legal trouble. A Florida trooper stopped Laura Elizabeth Barron in Orlando last September for a traffic infraction, then charged her with violating a state statute banning obscene stickers.</p>
        <p>The case was dismissed in Orange County Court. But Ms. Barron, who refused to remove the sticker, filed suit in United States District Court for Florida's Middle District, asking that she not be rearrested. She argues that her sticker, which includes profanity, is protected by the First Amendment. Her lawyer, Lawrence Walters, says the suit could test the law's constitutionality.</p>
        <p>Similar bans have been struck down in Georgia and Alabama, said David Hudson, of the Freedom Forum's First Amendment Center in Nashville. ''The reason often given is that bumper stickers distract other motorists,'' Mr. Hudson said. ''But it's really paternalistic and moralistic, not about driving.''</p>
