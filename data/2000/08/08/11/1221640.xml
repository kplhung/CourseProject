        <p>William C. Steere Jr., the chief executive of Pfizer Inc., will retire at the end of the year and will be replaced by Henry A. McKinnell, a 29-year manager of the drug company, who has long been seen as its next top executive.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Steere took over in 1992, Pfizer's sales have doubled, and over the last five years, its stock price has increased more than 400 percent. After it merged with Warner-Lambert this year, Pfizer became the largest drug company in the world.</p>
        <p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. Steere, 64, was not shy about taking credit.</p>
        <p>''It's the perfect time to leave,'' he said. ''I've done my part. We're No. 1. Now Hank has to figure out how to keep us there.''</p>
        <p>Analysts who cover the drug industry say they expect Mr. McKinnell to lead Pfizer much as Mr. Steere has. But they say it will not be easy for the new executive. Last month, for example, Pfizer disappointed Wall Street with second-quarter results that showed flat sales for Viagra and Zithromax, two of its top-selling drugs.</p>
        <p>''McKinnell is taking a company that has become huge and successful,'' said Sergio Traversa at ING Barings. ''I don't know how much room there is for improvement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinnell, 57, is president and chief operating officer of the company. He has also been president of Asian operations and worked for six years as chief financial officer. He is a Canadian citizen and grew up on an island in the Strait of Georgia near Vancouver. He has an M.B.A. and a doctorate in business from Stanford University.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinnell said he was excited to lead Pfizer at a time when genomics and biotechnology are changing the industry.</p>
        <p>''I don't think you've seen anything yet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steere will continue as chairman until Pfizer's annual meeting in April. After that, he will remain a member of the board. He said he would also work for Pfizer as a consultant and continue to lobby in Washington.</p>
        <p>In addition, he plans to spend more time scuba diving and spearfishing and at his home in Florida.</p>
        <p>''I recently bought a boat but had nowhere to put it,'' he said, ''so I bought a marina.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 12, 2000, Saturday  An entry in the Business Digest yesterday about the planned retirement of William C. Steere Jr., chief executive of Pfizer, misstated the increases in the company's sales and stock price during his leadership. Sales have doubled since 1992, not nearly tripled; the shares have increased more than 400 percent in the last five years, not 500 percent.</p>
