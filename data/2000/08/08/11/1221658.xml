        <p>It is not hard to find the spot on the sidewalk here where Jesus Maria Pedrosa was gunned down in June as he walked home on a quiet Sunday after watching a basketball game with friends.</p>
        <p>Scrawled on the wall behind the spot where Mr. Pedrosa fell when a single bullet tore through the back of his skull is blood-red graffiti in Basque saying: ''E.T.A., we are behind you.''</p>
        <p>Europe's longest-running guerrilla rebellion has exploded back into life since last December, when the Basque separatists, angry at what they saw as a lack of progress in negotiations with Spain, ended a 14-month truce.</p>
        <p>Since then the shadowy organization, E.T.A., whose full name means Basque Homeland and Liberty, has taken responsibility for a widening wave of death and destruction, with more than a dozen attacks in July alone.</p>
        <p>Spaniards are angry at the new wave of violence and frustrated at the failure to solve a conflict that -- unlike Northern Ireland's -- attracts almost no interest in the outside world. Vigils have been held across the country, and more than half a million people marched in Madrid to protest E.T.A.'s resort to more assassinations and car bombings.</p>
        <p>Juanjo Gastaniazatorre, like Mr. Pedrosa a councilor in this small Basque town for the center-right Popular Party, which governs in Madrid, sighed at the graffiti marking the place of his colleague's death. Sometimes efforts are made to take it away, he said. ''But it just comes back.''</p>
        <p>The latest wave of terrorism has crisscrossed the country, seeming to prove that E.T.A. can strike at almost any target, anywhere it likes: explosions have gone off in a rich Basque suburb and outside a shopping mall in downtown Madrid.</p>
        <p>The dead include local politicians like Mr. Pedrosa, and Jose Maria Martin Carpena, who was gunned down in front of his wife and daughter in Malaga, in the south, apparently just because he was a member of the Popular Party.</p>
        <p>In other cases, the victims were outspoken Basques. One was a Basque journalist who had increasingly criticized the more moderate nationalists for not taking a more active stance against violence. He was shot four times in the head and throat as he went to buy a newspaper in Andoain.</p>
        <p>And just two weeks ago, Juan Maria Jauregui, a retired Socialist Party governor of a Basque province who had repeatedly pressed for peace talks, was assassinated while home on vacation from his job in Chile. A bullet hole is still visible in the yellow wall of his restaurant, the Cafe Fronton, where he died.</p>
        <p>A waitress who witnessed the killing cannot sleep at night and does not come to work these days. The owner, J. L. Izaguirre, said the two assassins sat at the bar for a while drinking coffee. One wore a hat and dark glasses, which seemed odd to everyone. But not odd enough, he said, because no one reacted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Izaguirre, who was reluctant to give his full name, said that all he feels about the latest rash of violence is weariness -- though he could not seem to stop glancing at the white pock mark in his wall. ''We are all tired of this,'' he said. ''First terrorism, then a cease-fire, then terrorism again. It goes on and on.''</p>
        <p>[On Thursday, the ninth victim of the recent killings, a Spanish Army lieutenant, was buried. And near the Basque mountain village of Markina, Agence France-Presse reported, about 100 separatists, carrying Basque flags of green and white crosses on a red background, decorated with black ribbons, mourned an E.T.A. commander and three suspected accomplices who died on Monday when the car in which they were carrying explosives blew up.]</p>
        <p>Fear is growing among the five million residents in the rich and industrialized Basque region, an area of rugged hills that stretches across the French and Spanish border at the Atlantic end of the Pyrenees and includes Bilbao and San Sebastian.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, by one survey, 50 percent said they were afraid to talk politics with at least some of the people they knew. Today, about 70 percent say they are afraid.</p>
        <p>''One can wonder if democracy can even function there,'' said Emilio Lamo de Espinosa, the director of a prestigious Madrid research group, Instituto Universitario Ortega y Gasset.</p>
        <p>In Durango, Mr. Gastaniazatorre said the Popular Party sometimes cannot get people to run in local elections. He himself has survived one assassination attempt, and his country house was burned to the ground last year. He hardly leaves his Durango residence, and takes two bodyguards whenever he does.</p>
        <p>''I can't go to restaurants or anything like that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Basques are one of the most ancient people of Europe, identified even in the Roman times as fiercely dominant of this area. During the Middle Ages, Spanish rulers accorded them special liberties in acknowledgement of their customs and traditions. The Basque language appears to be related to no other.</p>
        <p>In more modern times, the Basques suffered heavy repression under the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco. Angry at Basque support of the leftists in the Civil War, Franco sought to stamp out any vestige of Basque identity.</p>
        <p>After Franco's death in 1975 and Spain's return to democracy, huge changes were introduced. In the hopes of diffusing various separatist movements, the new order gave all the country's regions a great deal of autonomy.</p>
        <p>Basque voters never ratified Spain's new constitution. The killing had begun in 1968, and even in democracy, the bloodshed continued. By now, E.T.A. has been blamed for more than 800 deaths.</p>
        <p>Surveys continue to show that maybe 30 percent of Basques still hope for sovereignty. Only 10 percent of the population identifies itself as Spanish, about 60 percent say they are both Spanish and Basque, and about 30 percent say they are Basque only.</p>
        <p>Arnaldo Otegi, the spokesman for Euskal Herritarok, the radical nationalists seen as ETA's political wing, says that violence will not end until the Basques have an independent state. Autonomy, he said, is not what anyone cares about.</p>
        <p>''In this time of globalization, why is it hard to understand we need our own country?'' Mr. Otegi asked. ''We are an industrialized country with a  $16,000-a-year average income. Why can't we decide our own future? Why is it different for us than for the Palestinians? Is the difference between them and us that we don't wear the scarf?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Otegi makes no apologies about the loss of life. ''You have to have the dead,'' he said, ''or else people will say there is no conflict.''</p>
        <p>Since the end of the cease-fire, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has continued to take a hard line with the separatists, declaring simply that he will not deal with terrorists. ''They are not going to see us blink,'' he said at Governor Jauregui's funeral on July 30.</p>
        <p>Some analysts say the problem is that the government gave too much away when Spain became a democracy. ''The regions in Spain are the most autonomous and independent in all of Europe,'' said Felipe Sahagun, a columinist for the newspaper El Mundo. ''They gave away all the cards 20 years ago. How can they negotiate now? They have nothing to give.''</p>
        <p>Others are critical of the government's actions during the 14-month truce, noting that only one meeting took place between the two sides. E.T.A. was not satisfied with what it calls a halfhearted gesture to bring Basque prisoners closer to home, rather than have them scattered as far away as the Canary Islands.</p>
        <p>In addition, a top Basque negotiator was arrested during the truce, infuriating the separatists.</p>
        <p>Some argue that E.T.A. agreed to the truce only because it was weakened by arrests in the late 1990's and needed to regroup. During the truce, police officials say, E.T.A. agents stole eight tons of explosives from a French Army barracks. Some of that materiel was recovered, but some was used this year in attacks, the police say.</p>
        <p>There is also widespread speculation that E.T.A. is now in the hands of younger, more hot-headed leaders less well-known to the police.</p>
        <p>Right now, optimism is in short supply. Jonan Fernandez, general coordinator of Elkarri, a nonprofit pro-separatist peace group based in San Sebastian, is a lonely voice in seeing the conflict in its final stages, hoping that E.T.A will again abandon violence and make new overtures for a negotiated solution.</p>
        <p>But he bemoans the lack of international interest. ''Why,'' he asked, ''is there no Camp David for us?''</p>
