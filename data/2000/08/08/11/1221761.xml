        <p>Williams College Museum of Art</p>
        <p>Williamstown, Mass.</p>
        <p>Through Sept. 10</p>
        <p>It's not often that art and history battle to a draw as neatly as in this oddly site-specific, two-part exhibition. Occupying two galleries at the  museum, the show brings together the photographic work of two women, one black, one white, commissioned 100 years apart by very different, but linked, ''institutions of higher learning.''</p>
        <p>In one gallery are Frances Benjamin Johnston's sepia-toned photographs, commissioned in 1899 by the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute (now Hampton University) in Hampton, Va. They show meticulously dressed and groomed nonwhite young men and women submitting to a proper Victorian education. Hampton, the country's first black vocational college, was founded in 1868 by Samuel Chapman Armstrong, the son of missionaries and an 1862 graduate of Williams College. Its goal was to educate select students to succeed in the American way of life, and its program soon expanded to include Native Americans.</p>
        <p>Johnston's slightly stiff, carefully staged tableaus, which were exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1900, show the students studying everything from geography and history to bricklaying, carpentry and dressmaking, to one another. They have been selected by the museum's associate curator, Vivian Patterson, in consultation with the artist Carrie Mae Weems. In ''Studying American History'' a group of them look intently at a Native American classmate wearing deerskin and a headdress. The pictures are small, claustrophobic and beautiful, as hard and exquisite as cut gems.</p>
        <p>At once innocent and contrived, idealistic and deluded, they both mimic and expose white culture. Created as document, they now stand as art, while revealing a strain of repressiveness that lies at the core of the American psyche and goes far beyond race.</p>
        <p>In the next gallery, the viewer encounters a photo installation by Ms. Weems, who for more than two decades has used images and texts to excavate the emotional and historical complexities of race in the United States. Commissioned by the Williams College Museum in 1996 as a response to the Johnston images, Ms. Weems's piece shows the dream of integration turning to dust.</p>
        <p>The piece is dominated by greatly enlarged images; grainy and ghostly, they line the walls and are printed on filmy fabric that hangs from the ceiling above the viewer's head in an arrangement that suggests banners but also creates a kind of labyrinth. The images that Ms. Weems uses vary; a few of Johnston's (including the one with the Native American on display) are contrasted with Hampton yearbook portraits from the 1930's and 50's. A 19th-century photograph of an Indian being baptized appears beside a well-known newspaper photograph of a more searing baptism: blacks being doused with a fire hose during civil rights protests in Birmingham, Ala. The piece, accompanied by a poetic voice-over by the artist that moves across time, forms an elegiac procession that veers between the obvious and the touching.</p>
        <p>On the final wall, a portrait of an ideal 19th-century middle-class white family (it turns out to be Armstrong, his wife and children) is flanked by before-and-after pictures of 10 young Native American men. The first, from 1878, shows them upon arrival at Hampton, wrapped in blankets, with long hair; in the second, taken two years later, they wear starched white shirts and suits, with cropped hair. These three images were not taken by Johnston, who was white; they were selected by Ms. Weems, who is black, from Hampton's archives. The show's final words, printed across the Armstrong family portrait, read: ''With your missionary might you extended the hand of grace, reaching down and snatching me up and from myself.''</p>
        <p>After the tortured beauty and compressed meanings of the Johnston photographs, Ms. Weems's big, fluttering images create an atmosphere of expansiveness and liberation, even as, combined with the voice-over, they move the viewer resolutely toward a sense of communal social failure.</p>
        <p>But while the piece confirms that Ms. Weems excels at a nonhectoring, yet clearly moral, open-endedness, it doesn't seem up to her usual standards. For one thing, it is too laden with formal precedents, from Barbara Kruger's fusions of word and image, to Jenny Holzer's cryptic aphorisms, to Robert Rauschenberg's image-laden translucent veils.</p>
        <p>Mainly, Ms. Weems's work seems too dependent, upon and too unequal to, the Johnston photographs, where the battle between art and history is most heated and autonomous. The power of Johnston's images tends to reduce Ms. Weems's efforts to a helpful, mind-clearing decompression chamber; but it's not certain that the conclusions her installation inspires aren't already available, just beneath the surface, in the earlier photographs.</p>
