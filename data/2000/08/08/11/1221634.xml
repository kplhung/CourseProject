        <p>French investigators looking into the crash last month of an Air France Concorde said today that a 16-inch piece of metal found on the runway probably caused a tire to blow out, sending debris from it through fuel tanks and starting a fire that erupted as the plane took off.</p>
        <p>It was the first time the investigators had offered a probable explanation for the fire on the jet, which crashed into a hotel north of Paris, killing 113 people.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the Bureau of Accident Investigations, which is looking into the causes of the crash, said that the metal strip appeared to match the shape of a gash found in one of the plane's left tires, and that it was ''probable that this piece caused the cut.''</p>
        <p>Since the disaster on July 25, investigators have focused on the possibility that a tire suffered a blowout and that debris from the tire damaged the plane, setting off the fire. In their statement today, the investigators said the tire, which burst as the plane was moving down the runway at about 195 miles an hour, threw off large chunks, some of them weighing as much as 9 pounds.</p>
        <p>The investigators steered clear of a final explanation, but they said that as a result of the debris from the tire, ''one of several fuel tanks on the left wing was very rapidly damaged, which resulted in a major fuel leak and fire.'' They said that exactly how this happened had not yet been determined.</p>
        <p>In earlier statements, the investigators said tire marks found on the runway after the crash showed that the aircraft had veered to the left before taking off. They said pieces of a water deflector affixed above the left side tires and debris from a fuel tank had also been found on the runway.</p>
        <p>Today the investigators said parts of the plane's No. 5 fuel tank had been found. The Concorde is outfitted with seven fuel tanks in each wing.</p>
        <p>The tires on the Concorde are supplied by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, which manufactures them in Virginia. Last week, Goodyear officials confirmed that the company's specialists had been sent to France to assist the investigators.</p>
        <p>The investigators have so far been unable to say whether the metal strip was part of the Concorde.</p>
