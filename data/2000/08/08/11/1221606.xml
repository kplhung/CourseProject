        <p>Coin collecting is one field that is, literally, child's play.

        <p>Coin collecting is one field that is, literally, child's play. The United States Mint reports that millions of Americans collect coins, new and old, and that of these, tens of thousands are children who are on the prowl for historic American gold, silver and copper coins. Now there is a new source in Manhattan for coins, as well as historical American documents.</p>
        <p>Wall Street Rarities, at 44 Wall Street, is a new gallery housed in a former bank, and it has retained the bank's 1920's two-story vault with a four-foot-thick circular steel door. The counters and walls display rare coins, historical documents, letters and historical paintings. The gallery also has a site on the Internet: www.wsrarities.com, which is geared to both the amateur and serious collector.</p>
        <p>The gallery, whose logo is ''own a piece of history,'' is just yards from the spot where George Washington was inaugurated as president.</p>
        <p>Wall Street Rarities was founded in 1999 by two young entrepreneurs. William T. Anton III, the president, is a third-generation numismatist who has collected coins since childhood. Now 33, he studied at Princeton, Oxford and Harvard Law School and worked for Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, the Manhattan law firm, for five years before returning to his hobby full time.</p>
        <p>''When I was at Oxford I used to visit the small coin dealers,'' Mr. Anton said. ''I realized that it's a very decentralized business. Then, as a lawyer specializing in industry consolidations, I realized I could take my hobby and build a national business.''</p>
        <p>So he left the law firm. ''I wanted to bring the passion of collecting to the mass market,'' he said. ''I'm democratizing collecting, taking out the elitism and intimidation. It's like what the Web has done to investing. Now everyone is an investor. I want everyone to be able to be a collector.''</p>
        <p>Prices for the gallery's coins range from $29.95 for a 2000 United States silver coin depicting Standing Lady Liberty to $575,000 for a rare 1792 silver-center cent, the first of the United States-pattern cents made by David Rittenhouse, the Mint's first director. It shows the head of Liberty with flowing hair and the date and the inscription ''Liberty Parent of Science &amp; Industry.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Anton estimates there are at least 100,000  collectors of vintage coins in America. Stephen L. Bobbitt, the press officer of the American Numismatic Association, a nonprofit group based in Colorado, said there are about 75,000 ''very serious'' collectors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anton's business partner, Seth T. Kaller, is the firm's director of rare documents and works of art, including a painting of George Washington -- the so-called Goldsborough-Frelinghuysen portrait, circa 1789-1791 -- by Charles Willson Peale, a saddler and woodcarver, the father of a dynasty of American painters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaller, 35, grew up working in his family's business, which specialized in rare stamps and coins. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1988, he began to advise museums and private clients trying to acquire historical documents. He became the exclusive acquisition agent for the Gilder Lehrman Collection, which contains 50,000 historic American documents now on deposit at the Pierpont Morgan Library in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>One part of this collection is a series of working drafts of the United States Constitution, which was used as the basis of a college textbook, ''The Boisterous Sea of Liberty: A Documentary History of America from Discovery Through the Civil War,'' by David Brion Davis and Steven Mintz (Oxford University Press, 1998).</p>
        <p>Mr. Anton and Mr. Kaller suggested that people collect in different ways. ''Some buy only coins,'' Mr. Anton said. ''We also help people collect around a person or a theme. If you like George Washington, here you can buy a Washington-era coin, an original letter written by Washington, and a pair of George and Martha Washington ''porthole'' portraits, circa 1859, painted by Rembrandt Peale.'' (The original ''porthole'' portrait of Washington, painted in 1823, is on display in the Capitol. There are thought to be about 80 replicas.)</p>
        <p>''It's one of seven pairs that remain together, including those at the Met and Smithsonian,'' Mr. Anton said.</p>
        <p>This weekend Wall Street Rarities will have a booth at the World's Fair of Money, the American Numismatic Association's annual convention, at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia. It is free and runs through Sunday. There will be about 1,500 dealers at the show, which also sponsors seminars and courses for young numismatists. Mr. Bobbitt said 20,000 people are expected to attend.</p>
        <p>Quite apart from its more affordable coins and documents, Wall Street Rarities has grouped 100 documents into a package it calls ''The Founding of America Collection,'' which carries a price tag of $8.5 million and is on view at the gallery. ''We're selling the collection as a unit because we are hoping to find a client who will want to exhibit it in a public way,'' Mr. Kaller said.</p>
        <p>It includes several documents that one would expect to find only in museums. There is a first New York edition of Thomas Paine's ''Common Sense,'' the pamphlet advocating that the American colonies separate from Britain. ''This 1776 piece is credited with changing history,'' Mr. Anton said. There is a copy of the circular signed by John Hancock and others on Sept. 14, 1768, railing against the taxes ''imposed upon the People without their consent,'' the seminal document laying out the cry ''No Taxation Without Representation!''</p>
        <p>A Declaration of Independence from July 4, 1776, printed in Massachusetts, shows signs of folding and wear and was probably originally tacked onto the door of a church. According to Mr. Kaller, in 1776 more than 1,000 broadsides of the Declaration were printed and distributed to ministers of all denominations to read to their congregations. ''Five hundred were printed in Philadelphia, of which 25 are known to survive,'' he said. ''Fourteen are known to survive from Massachusetts, and this is an official Massachusetts broadside.'' He noted that the Declaration of Independence was not actually signed until August.</p>
        <p>On July 29 Sotheby's sold another broadside, the so-called Dunlap Declaration of Independence, on Sothebys.com for $8.14 million.</p>
        <p>The collection also includes one of the first original facsimiles of the Declaration, known as the ''Stone'' printing. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams saw that the original Declaration was showing signs of wear so he commissioned William J. Stone to engrave an exact copy. Congress ordered 201 official copies of the Declaration to be printed and distributed to surviving signers, families of the signers, General Lafayette, the president and other public servants.</p>
        <p>''The original Declaration of Independence, in the National Archives, is badly faded,'' Mr. Kaller pointed out. ''There are 31 copies known to survive, including ours, and 19 of them are permanently housed in public collections.''</p>
        <p>A letter from Abigail Adams to Mrs. Hannah Cushing in 1802 puts a personal stamp on the politics of the day. Thomas Jefferson had defeated her husband, and there was a major shift in the leadership of the new nation. ''The Golden Age Is Past,'' Mrs. Adams wrote. ''God Grant That It May Not Be Succeeded By An Age of Terror.''</p>
        <p>''The Founding of America Collection'' is on view through August and the Washington portraits through Sept. 15. The gallery's next special exhibition, opening on Aug. 21, is ''Highlights of History,'' with documents from Napoleon, Churchill, Einstein, Machiavelli and Catherine de Medici.</p>
