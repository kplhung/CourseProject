        <p>Two toddlers were fighting for their lives last night after they wandered out of a house in Carle Place on Long Island and fell into a swimming pool, the police said.</p>
        <p>The girls, Patricia Graca, age 2 1/2, and Natalie Correia, 1 1/2, slipped out a side door of Patricia's house at 230 Rushmore Avenue at 2:30 p.m., said Officer Adele Burke, a spokeswoman for the Nassau County Police. They ended up in the pool, which is 4 feet deep and 10 feet by 20 feet, Officer Burke said.</p>

        <p>When Patricia's mother found the girls unconscious in the pool, she screamed, and neighbors came and pulled them out, Officer Burke said. Someone performed CP.R until the ambulance arrived.</p>
        <p>Both girls were in critical condition and on ventilators at local hospitals last night.</p>
