        <p>A federal judge today threw out parts of the sweeping election-money overhaul that took effect in Vermont this year, setting the stage for the latest major legal challenge to the country's campaign finance system.</p>
        <p>The state may not impose mandatory spending limits on candidates, the judge ruled, nor may it limit contributions from political parties and from out-of-staters.</p>
        <p>But the judge, William K. Sessions III of Federal District Court, upheld Vermont's contribution limits, which are the lowest in the country for individual donors to candidates. Contributors may give a statewide candidate no more than $400, and a candidate for the State House of Representatives no more than $200.</p>
        <p>Advocates of campaign finance changes said that though the ruling went partly against them, they welcomed it, because Judge Sessions seemed to signal that he wanted the case to be examined by a higher court, and they planned to appeal the ruling up to the United States Supreme Court if necessary.</p>
        <p>''We could not have asked for stronger language from a district court judge with respect to why this matter needs to be reviewed by a higher court,'' said John C. Bonifaz, executive director of the National Voting Rights Institute, a nonprofit group specializing in campaign finance litigation.</p>
        <p>In the scattered state-level push to clean up campaign finance, Maine has gone first but Vermont has possibly gone the farthest. When it enacted a new campaign finance law that included mandatory spending limits in 1997 -- like the $300,000 limit for candidates for governor -- it reopened the question of whether such limits were constitutional. No other state had tried to impose such limits since the Supreme Court's seminal Buckley v. Valeo decision in 1976, which deemed spending limits an unconstitutional violation of a candidate's right to free speech.</p>
        <p>In today's ruling, Judge Sessions quoted four sitting Supreme Court justices who have indicated that they, too, might be willing to reopen the Buckley ruling.</p>
        <p>''Powerful, if not controlling, judicial commentary such as this reinforces the view that the constitutionality of expenditure limits bears review and reconsideration,'' Judge Sessions wrote of the justices' opinions. ''Spending limits are an effective response to certain compelling governmental interests not addressed in Buckley.''</p>
        <p>The Buckley case focused largely on the danger of corruption or the appearance of corruption. In the trial that led to today's ruling, witnesses attested to other ways that a lack of spending limits hurts the political system: It fosters public cynicism and political apathy, they said; it leads to an abundance of rich, self-financed candidates; and it leads officeholders to spend inordinate time raising money for re-election instead of on their official duties.</p>
        <p>In his ruling, Judge Sessions said the testimony convinced him that such problems were real. But, he said, he was bound in this case, Landell v. Sorrell, by the Supreme Court's decision in the Buckley case.</p>
        <p>Because the appeal will take time, today's ruling is expected to stand through Vermont's current campaign -- a campaign in which the playing field has suddenly shifted.</p>
        <p>In the race for governor, Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat, has chosen the ''public financing'' option included in the state's new campaign finance law. After raising a bit of money to qualify, he gets more than $250,000 in state money to run his campaign, and may spend no more.</p>
        <p>But the candidate expected to be his toughest opponent, Ruth Dwyer, a Republican, no longer has to abide by the $300,000 limit on her spending that had been in effect. Her campaign has already raised about $140,000.</p>
        <p>''We'll just keep raising money,'' Ms. Dwyer said. ''I have no idea how much money we can raise. It's still hard with the $400 limits.''</p>
        <p>Today's ruling does not affect the public-financing aspect of the Vermont law, which was not challenged.</p>
        <p>James Bopp Jr., an Indiana lawyer who challenged the law on behalf of the Vermont Republican Party and others, noted that today's decision fell into line with the United States Supreme Court's decision in January upholding $1,000 contribution limits in Missouri.</p>
        <p>The lesson, Mr. Bopp said, is that ''it's going to be difficult to strike down individual contribution limits -- but the good news is that that rationale doesn't apply to parties.''  Testimony at the trial had supported the special role parties play in the political system, he said, and underscored that money from political parties was not corrupting.</p>
        <p>As for the spending limits, ''this is a major defeat for the reformers, who were hoping to get the court to overrule Buckley,'' he said. The campaign finance reform advocates had presented new facts, he said, but added, ''it's the First Amendment that matters.''</p>
        <p>Invoking the First Amendment, the American Civil Liberties Union's Vermont branch had also challenged the new campaign finance law, though it generally supports campaign finance changes.</p>
        <p>''This opinion,'' said Ben Scotch, its executive director, ''is completely consistent with the proposition that reform of campaign finance is a conundrum for nearly everyone.'' Judge Sessions, he said, ''just adds his name to a long list of people who find this very troubling.''</p>
        <p>Judge Sessions wrote: ''The integrity of our democracy is inextricably bound to the voices of those with lesser means. Thus, the categorical preservation of free speech and association cannot lay waste to our other core democratic values such as effective representation, equal access to the political system, and honest, responsive government.''</p>
