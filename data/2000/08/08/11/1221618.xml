        <p>''Unnatural Science'' at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art is a well-done exhibition. The first serious theme show to be organized in the vaulting refurbished factory spaces of Mass MOCA, which opened to the public last year, it is thoughtfully installed, coherent yet diverse, and presents most of its participants to good advantage.</p>
        <p>It also has an eminently topical theme, given the computer-generated nature of almost everything, the regular advances in science and medicine, the constant refinements in digital imaging and the arrival of the genome era. Science and its technologies press in on us from all sides, and artists are bound to use them, adapting, mimicking, distorting and commenting upon them as they see fit.</p>

        <p>''Unnatural Science'' at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art is a well-done exhibition. The first serious theme show to be organized in the vaulting refurbished factory spaces of Mass MOCA, which opened to the public last year, it is thoughtfully installed, coherent yet diverse, and presents most of its participants to good advantage.</p>
        <p>It also has an eminently topical theme, given the computer-generated nature of almost everything, the regular advances in science and medicine, the constant refinements in digital imaging and the arrival of the genome era. Science and its technologies press in on us from all sides, and artists are bound to use them, adapting, mimicking, distorting and commenting upon them as they see fit.</p>
        <p>The only thing missing is staying power. Too many of the artworks in this show stick to familiar strategies or are little more than elaborate, often beautifully executed illustrations of some scientific fact or fantasy. In one work, for example, it is possible to watch hundreds of little flags flutter in exactly the same speed and direction as the winds outside the building -- the kind of effect that looks great in a science museum or, even better, across wavy fields of grain. The show provides very few experiences that don't evaporate almost before you vacate Mass MOCA's handsomely renovated premises.</p>
        <p>The sight of artists grappling with intractable materials or difficult thought is relatively rare here. The beautiful, abstruse paintings of Matthew Ritchie, with their meldings of creation myth, Big Bang theory and polytheism, offer some resistance, and also provide one of the show's few moments of color. (Catherine Chalmers's big color photographs of insects and reptiles instinctually enacting the food chain in action provide the other.)</p>
        <p>But too often the show is about art for consumption's sake, works whose meanings are completely available either visually or with the help of an explanatory brochure. As with so many big shows lately, one begins to suspect that the museum theme show, once the litmus test of curatorial talent, is morphing into a no-brainer, and that art is doing its bit to help.</p>
        <p>In these post-Conceptual times, when art is so overtly involved with narrative and subject matter reigns, it's getting easier and easier to come up with catchy, accessible, viewer-friendly art links -- art and fashion, film, religion or history. Add to this the institutionalization of Conceptual-oriented installation art and the ever-larger museum spaces being built to accommodate it. The result is festivalism, as Peter Schjeldahl aptly put it in The New Yorker last summer: big shows that present a succession of big, encompassing artworks quarantined in separate galleries, so that the viewer moves from one discrete experience of total immersion to the next.</p>
        <p>''Unnatural Science'' is a case of mini-festivalism. It contains only 14 works by 15 artists, but each has been given quantities of space and is seen pretty much in isolation. And each provides an ''experience.''</p>
        <p>So it's telling to simply walk through this show and notice which experience holds your attention and which doesn't. There is plenty that is handsome and momentarily engaging. Gary Schneider's ''Genetic Self-Portrait,'' with its greatly magnified black-and-white images of such details as a strand of the artist's hair or his DNA have a strange deathliness considering their extreme focus on life. In ''Apparatus for the Distillation of Vague Intuitions,'' Eve Andree Laramee takes her usual chem-lab sculptures to mad-scientist extremes, covering two large tables  with towering transparent edifices of  glass beakers and coiling tubes, although there's a strong resemblance to an elegant window display.</p>
        <p>And clearly intended as the exhibition's showstopper is Tim Hawkinson's ''Uberorgan,'' which fills Mass MOCA's largest, football-field-size gallery with a dozen white plastic bladder-shaped balloons the size of small whales. Equipped with big telescoping horns made of cardboard and aluminum foil and triggered by a device similar to a player-piano roll, the balloons function as bagpipes, bleating out the notes of four Christian hymns in very low octaves. The economy of filling such a large space with so much sound and form using a relatively small amount of material is impressive. ''Uberorgan'' is definitely an experience, but the most lasting impression, as is usual with this artist, is one of boyish genius and industriousness.</p>
        <p>There are numerous opportunities for total immersion here, but little that you dip into feels very new, unless you use narrative as the yardstick. Repeatedly generic visual strategies are used to convey less familiar subject matter -- that is, the words change, but the tunes don't.</p>
        <p>Thus Michael Oatman's ''Long Shadows: Henry Perkins and the Eugenics Survey of Vermont (Vermont Pure)'' partakes of the lengthening tradition of the walk-in diorama re creation as practiced by Ilya Kabokov, Mark Dion, Barbara Bloom and other artists. Mr. Oatman, who has worked in the diorama format himself since the early 1990's, has assembled here the half-real, half-imagined office of Perkins -- the first director of the Robert Hull Fleming Museum of the University of Vermont -- whose zoological training found perverse expression in the racist pseudo-science of eugenics that sought to weed out ''undesirable'' genetic traits through sterilization.</p>
        <p>The display is fastidiously detailed and fascinatingly creepy -- a kind of walk-in history lesson -- but its most powerful element is simple: a videotape of an actor giving a lecture whose racist ideas are drawn from Perkins's letters and eugenics propaganda. In one of the installation's many unnecessary touches, it is projected on a painting of a landscape.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Lim Young-sun's ''Room of the Host,'' adds capably but unexceptionally to the ever-expanding installation-art tradition of the darkened room in which the viewer is surrounded by mysterious lighted objects and strange sounds. (Practitioners of this genre range from regulars like Tatsuo Miyajima to one-time users like Serge Spitzer, who created an unaccountable stir at last year's Venice Biennale by lining up empty glasses in a huge darkened shed.) In this case the objects are small jars containing green fluid and little specimenlike resin casts that suggest skulls, bones, vertebrae and jellyfish that hang from the ceiling.  Thomas Grunfeld's 1994 ''Misfit (St. Bernhard),'' a stuffed dog with a sheep's face, staves off complete Surrealist hokiness with a weird, saintly serenity, but may also have contributed to the craze for anatomically incorrect taxidermical jokes that currently afflicts sculpture.</p>
        <p>The most impressive works in the show are two old standards. One is Peter Fischli and David Weiss's 30-minute 1987 film classic, ''Der Lauf der Dinge'' (''The Way Things Go''). A seemingly uninterrupted domino effect of chain reactions involving oozing foam, pendulums, balances,  inclined planes, rolling objects of all kinds and occasional fireworks, it creates an effect of 70's Process Art in perpetual motion. Equally good is Steina Vasulka's 1993 video installation ''Borealis,'' which captures the uncontrollable power of nature in constantly moving, spatially disorienting images of roaring water, breaking waves and moist, loudly crunching undergrowth. Ms. Vasulka's aggressive manipulation of her medium matches her subject. The wildness of nature, the weirdness of video and the susceptibility of human perception play a hallucinatory game of tag here, and the viewer struggles to keep up.</p>
        <p>But these works are among the exceptions in an exhibition that suggests -- as Donald Judd once said of 80's painting -- that theme shows are becoming a form of musical comedy. The analogy conjures up not only the endless recycling of familiar conventions -- which I think was Judd's meaning -- but also a sequence of more or less pleasant entertainments in which each player executes a song-and-dance routine that works well with the other numbers and then exits gracefully, clearing the stage for the next performer.</p>
        <p>''Unnatural Science'' remains at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, Mass., (413) 664-4481, through April 15. Information online: www.massmoca.org.</p>
