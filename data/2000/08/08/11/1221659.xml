        <p>The former No. 2 man in the New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association pleaded guilty today to defrauding the organization and its members of hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
        <p>But in making the plea, the former executive vice president, William Saksinsky, sought to implicate the current deputy director of the Newark Police Department in one of many schemes to siphon money from the organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saksinsky agreed to pay back the P.B.A. $400,000 that he stole over five years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saksinsky, 68, of Perth Amboy, N.J., told Judge Katharine S. Hayden of Federal District Court that the city police official, Rocco Malanga, who was then the head of the state P.B.A.'s Newark chapter, conspired with him and others to divert money from a pool of artificially inflated convention charges in 1992 and 1993.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malanga, who had never before been named in connection with the investigation into the group's finances, did not return calls. But his lawyer, Anthony Pope, called the allegations against his client ''an attempt to smear and defame'' his reputation. He said Mr. Saksinsky had once been challenged by Mr. Malanga for a leadership position within the benevolent association.</p>
        <p>''One must be very suspicious of defendants who plead guilty to reduced charges and are seeking leniency,'' Mr. Pope said.</p>
        <p>Last November, Mr. Saksinsky was named in a 32-count indictment along with the P.B.A.'s former president, Frank Ginesi, 78, with whom he ran the organization from 1978 to 1997. They were charged with siphoning as much as $1 million from the 35,000-member organization from 1991 to 1996, and Mr. Saksinsky, a former Perth Amboy police officer, was said to have built a fortune totaling $3 million in the process.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ginesi, a former state corrections officer, is awaiting trial, and, according to his lawyer, Chester M. Keller, an assistant federal public defender, has not had any plea negotiations with prosecutors.</p>
        <p>The charges against the two officials grew out of a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry, triggered by a series of telephone tips in 1997 from some of the newly elected leadership of the state police group. They suspected fraud when they examined the group's financial records.</p>
        <p>Ralph Marra, an assistant United States attorney, said the investigation growing out of those tips was continuing.</p>
        <p>Also pleading guilty today to one count of mail fraud under a plea agreement was an associate of Mr. Saksinky's, Edward Rappleyea, 71, of Sayreville, N.J., who had been co-administrator of the group's insurance fund. He admitted to withdrawing $170,000 from group accounts which was among the money that he and his co-conspirators used to buy real estate, cars and jewelry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saksinsky faces a maximum jail sentence of five years and a fine of $250,000 when he is sentenced by Judge Hayden on Nov. 2. Under the original 32-count indictment he faced a maximum of 10 years in prison.</p>
        <p>The state group's current leadership applauded today's guilty pleas and the beginning of a resolution to  the long investigation of the previous administration of the group.</p>
        <p>But Anthony Weiners, an executive vice president of the group, expressed surprise at the idea that Mr. Malanga might have participated in some of the schemes and said P.B.A. officials would look into it.</p>
        <p>Others close to the investigation said the state group had been informed about the allegations. They said that as recently as last week, the former head of the Newark chapter, who is on leave from that post, was brought up on disciplinary charges. The outcome of hearings on those charges are to be announced next week, the investigators said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saksinsky, in describing one of the schemes that he and others used to defraud the group, told prosecutors that in 1992 and 1993, they inflated the registration fees for the benevolent association's miniconventions by $10 a person to generate profits for themselves. As a result, he told Judge Hayden, he and Mr. Ginesi and Mr. Malanga had split a total of $58,000 in 1992, and in the next year split a total of $25,000.</p>
        <p>The schemes also involved creation of secret accounts that only he controlled and into which he would deposit cash and checks ostensibly paid for association purposes like insurance and other operations.</p>
