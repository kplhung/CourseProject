        <p>A man who was shot through the window of his Range Rover outside a downtown nightclub early yesterday managed to drive away but lost control after two blocks, the police said, and struck a Swedish-born director of award-winning television commercials. Both men died.</p>
        <p>The incident started about 4 a.m., in front of NV, a bar and lounge at 289 Spring Street, in an industrial area on the western fringes of SoHo, the police said. The driver of the Range Rover, Ivory Davis, 27, was double-parked outside the club when a gunman shot him about four times, investigators said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis, who was hit twice and started bleeding heavily, sped east along Spring Street, losing control at the Avenue of the Americas, where his sport utility vehicle struck the director, Jhoan Camitz, 38, who was preparing to cross the street, the police said. Mr. Camitz was hurled into the air.</p>
        <p>''I just saw the guy for a minute, and then I lost him from my eyes, '' said Alex Kathis, who was setting up his coffee and doughnut stand when he saw the accident across the street. ''He had no chance to do anything.''</p>
        <p>The Range Rover then crashed into a 30-foot traffic pole, knocking it down, tore into the patio of the Aquagrill restaurant, and knocked down several planters before flipping onto its side. Mr. Davis died at the scene.</p>
        <p>Mr. Camitz died at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center. He was revived for several hours but died at 7 a.m.</p>
        <p>He had been on his way home from a night out with friends, eating Japanese food and bar-hopping in SoHo, said a friend and colleague, Adam Kimmel. ''I assume he was probably walking until he saw a cab, like we all do,'' Mr. Kimmel said yesterday as he fielded telephone calls from Mr. Camitz's friends and family.</p>
        <p>The young director's colleagues regarded him as a rising star. Last year, a Volkswagen commercial that he directed won an ANDY award, the top prize from the Advertising Club of New York. The ad depicted a dog propping itself up against a table to bask in a fan's breeze.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mr. Camitz garnered two gold Clio awards, and three gold and one silver award at the Cannes Advertising Film Awards, for a series of advertisements he directed for Nike. In one, a boy squeezes a steak so that its juices run onto a soccer ball, which he takes outside and kicks down the street while neighborhood dogs chase after him.</p>
        <p>The chief operating officer at Propaganda/Satellite Films, Trevor Macy, said that Mr. Camitz was just starting to venture into feature films. He was adapting ''Already Dead,'' a novel by Denis Johnson.</p>
        <p>''Film-making was his passion more than anything,'' Mr. Macy said. ''We were so excited about the development of his career.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis was a co-owner of a company called Yoyo Records, a label that primarily produces rap music and is based on Pleasant Avenue in Weehawken, N.J., the police said, but he also used an address in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn. He used several pseudonyms, including Ivery Davis, Irv Davis and David Caprice, the police said.</p>
        <p>This was not the first shooting in which Mr. Davis had been involved, the police said. In February, he was shot while inside or near the Tunnel club, they said. He had been arrested six times and was awaiting a sentence for an assault conviction. He was paroled in 1995 after serving one to three years for attempted second-degree robbery, state records show.</p>
        <p>William H. Allee, the chief of detectives, said the police were investigating Mr. Davis's possible involvement in other recent shootings in the area.</p>
        <p>Investigators said they did not know whether the gunman, whom the police were trying to identify, or Mr. Davis, had been inside the club.</p>
        <p>City Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, who represents Lower Manhattan, said that if the police concluded the shooting was the result of a a dispute at the club, she would try to  have it closed down.</p>
        <p>''That club has been a problem since the day it opened,'' Ms. Freed said. ''They periodically would meet with the community and promise to clean up their act. For a little while it would be fine, and then they'd just go back to their usual problems.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Freed said that in one incident, a rap artist was shot outside, and in another, a bouncer there fired several shots from an unlicensed handgun.</p>
        <p>State Liquor Authority records show that in April 1997, NV paid a $1,500 penalty after it was cited for operating without a cabaret license and for having disorderly premises, a count that resulted from an altercation there, said Maris Hart, an authority spokeswoman. And in August of that year, the club paid a $4,000 penalty after it was cited for being too noisy and after illegal drugs were found there, Ms. Hart said.</p>
        <p>Jon Cantor, the general manager and co-owner of NV, said he doubted that Mr. Davis or the man who shot him had been inside the club, which closed at 2:45 a.m., more than an hour before the incident. Mr. Cantor said he watched the incident on a videotape from a surveillance camera outside his club.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cantor said that the tape showed the gunman coming around the corner from Hudson Street, and that he was wearing a baseball cap, which is not allowed under NV's dress code.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cantor said he handed that videotape over to the police, as well as footage from a surveillance system that photographs clubgoers as they enter.</p>
        <p>''We run an upscale, professional place,'' he said. ''You cannot control what happens outside of your club after you've closed.''</p>
