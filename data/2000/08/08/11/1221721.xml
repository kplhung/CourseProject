        <p>When Woody Austin comes to the Buick Open, his game somehow comes together.</p>
        <p>In 169 starts on the PGA Tour, the 1995 Buick Open is the only tournament Austin has won. Five years later, at the same event, Austin enjoyed a round that he will talk about for the rest of his life.</p>
        <p>Making almost every putt he looked at -- and leaving Tiger Woods and the rest of a strong field in pursuit -- Austin's nine-under-par 63 gave him a two-stroke lead today after the opening round at Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club.</p>
        <p>Paul Azinger, who shot a 65, was alone in second place, while Vijay Singh and Joe Ozaki were tied for third at 66. Woods, looking rusty in his first tournament since winning the British Open, shot a 70 and was seven strokes off the lead heading into the second round. Friday.</p>
        <p>Austin almost equaled the course record of 62, set by Jim Furyk in 1995 and tied by Sonny Skinner in 1997. It was the best putting round Austin has had at any time on any course. Austin needed only 22 putts, including 14 one-putts, in a round that featured 11 birdies and only two bogeys.</p>
        <p>How could anyone have seen this coming? In five full seasons on the Tour, Austin has never finished in the top 150 in putting. How badly has Austin struggled this year? He started the season by missing the cut six consecutive times.</p>
        <p>So forgive Austin for smiling after today's round. At least for one day, he planned to enjoy his lead.</p>
        <p>''For some reason, I always putt well on this place, and today I made almost every putt I could've made,'' said the 36-year-old Austin, who is 108th on this year's Tour money list. ''These are the best greens on Tour, and even though I played late in the afternoon, the ball still rolled smoothly. I have played so bad, for so long, I just wanted to make sure I didn't back off.</p>
        <p>''After I made a bogey on my ninth hole, it was important that I came right back and kept making birdies down the stretch. This is the first time in a long time that I played 18 good holes instead of just nine.''</p>
        <p>Starting his day on No. 10, Austin birdied his first five holes, showing immediately that he was on top of his game. Ball-striking is the strength of Austin's game, and with solid drives and excellent approach shots, he kept giving himself birdie opportunities. Through 13 holes, Austin never had to make a birdie putt longer than 12 feet. His first long putt for birdie came at No. 6, Austin's 15th hole, when he made a 25-footer. At No. 7, Austin made a 15-footer for birdie.</p>
        <p>The biggest letdown of his day came on his final hole, No. 9, when Austin pulled his drive into the left rough, then hit a poor second shot over the green and underneath the grandstand. After getting a free drop behind the green, Austin chipped to 10 feet, but missed the putt and settled for bogey, costing him a tie for the course record. But at that point, he hardly cared.</p>
        <p>''I needed to see some positive things about my game,'' Austin said, ''and I did.''</p>
        <p>Woods had a streaky day. He made a rare double bogey. He missed a putt from 18 inches. Yet, when the day ended, he was still two under par, making three consecutive birdies on the back nine that turned his day around.</p>
        <p>''It was a little tough to get my rhythm,'' Woods said. ''I started out birdie-birdie, but I didn't feel that great over the ball, and it ended up catching up with me. I had the same focus I normally do. I just couldn't hit the shots where I wanted. You can't play well all the time; that's the great thing about this game. Today was a perfect example of that. I wasn't that far off, but I was off.''</p>
        <p>Woods birdied the first two holes, but it wasn't long before the rust from his two-week layoff appeared. At the par-4 No. 5, Woods made bogey, hitting his second shot over the green, chipping 10 feet past the hole, then missing the putt. Then came his double bogey at the par-3 No. 8, when he hit a bad tee shot left of the green, hit a high flop shot over trees and onto the green, then three-putted. At No. 10, Woods missed an 18-inch par putt, staring at the hole in disbelief as the ball spun out of the hole.</p>
        <p>To his credit, Woods regrouped with birdies at No. 11, No. 12, No. 13 and No. 16 to give himself a positive feeling heading into Friday. But today belonged to Austin.</p>
        <p>''This was a dream round,'' Austin said. ''I made every putt I could have made until the last hole. I can't ask for anything better than that.''</p>
