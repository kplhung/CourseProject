        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.  ++ means discounted tickets were available at the TKTS booth for last Friday night only.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT'' (Tony winner for best musical, choreography and featured actor and actress). The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly un related vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Deborah Yates and the Tony winners Boyd Gaines and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical, it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form as ''Contact'' weaves romance from a reality we are all familiar with (2:00). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $85 (Ben Brantley).</p>

        <p>*+ ''COPENHAGEN'' (Tony winner for best play, director and featured actress). Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (the Tony-winning Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $65; $25 student rush at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''KISS ME, KATE.'' (Tony winner for best musical revival, director of a musical, musical actor, costumes and orchestration). A mouthwatering revival, with ham as the plat du jour, of Cole Porter's sybarite's delight of a musical about battling egos in show business. As presented by a preening cast led by the wonderful Marin Mazzie and the Tony-winning Brian Stokes Mitchell, who wear a spotlight as if it were a dressing gown and vice versa, this ''Kate'' proves that ham can indeed make a banquet if the spices are zesty enough. Avoiding the attitudes that are anathema to lively revivals of vintage musicals -- reverence and condescension -- the director Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad, brazen and finally irresistible. The production, which doesn't seem to have a thought in its giddy head beyond entertaining us as much as it is entertaining itself, feels like one long ear-to-ear grin. The top-drawer Porter score has been beautifully orchestrated by Don Sebesky and is appetizingly sung by an ensemble that conspicuously features a sharp-edged ingenue named Amy Spanger (2:20). Beck, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29 to $84 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER.'' This revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's 1939 farce, starring Nathan Lane in a role famously modeled on Alexander Woollcott, feels busy without being lively. Under the direction of Jerry Zaks, the production seems to exist in neither the then nor the now. Much of the acting is a series of flourishes that sell individual jokes without being anchored to character or context. And Mr. Lane, looking like a cuddly, Mattel-made Sigmund Freud doll in his beard and spectacles, never quite comes up with a coherent performance; it's as if he is still experimenting with his options. Tony Walton's richly colored set is a showroom-perfect evocation of period style that fits nicely into the newly restored American Airlines Theater (formerly the Selwyn). But the evening's most authentic glimpses into a vanished era of madcap celebrities are provided by Lewis J. Stadlen, in a character inspired by Harpo Marx, and Byron Jennings, as a charming Noel Cowardesque narcissist. Unfortunately, their appearances onstage feel as brief and brilliant as lightning (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $65, half-price for children 18 and under (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''THE MUSIC MAN.'' A show that makes you feel ridiculously happy one instant and seriously sleepy the next. The director and choreographer Susan Stroman, who created the inspired dance-musical ''Contact,'' isn't as confident in her take on Meredith Willson's jubilant story of a traveling con man who brings rhythm to the stolid town of River City, Iowa. Her transforming imagination stops when the music stops. The production has two perfectly agreeable stars in Craig Bierko, in the title role, and Rebecca Luker, as the frosty librarian who learns to melt. But you get the impression that most of the people onstage are just pretending to live in a land of corn-fed propriety and corny jokes, marking time until a production number comes along to let them show their stuff. When the show is singing or, especially, dancing, it often seems to have winged feet; when it's just talking or clowning around, those feet are flat (2:50). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>++ ''AVOW.'' When two young gay men ask a Roman Catholic priest to marry them, they set off a series of events that end with the priest's falling for the pregnant, unmarried sister of one of the men and questioning his own vows of chastity. But Bill C. Davis's new comedy never really addresses the questions it raises about same-sex unions, single mothers, gay parenting and priestly celibacy. So when Mr. Davis actually confronts these issues head on, he too often takes the easy way out -- with a laugh. When his characters talk of their struggles of conscience, it is only in vague terms in which they end up representing ideas in a debate rather than emerging as real people. So while ''Avow'' often succeeds on the comedic level, it is only skin deep on the human level. In the end the play covers little new ground and offers no insights. Jack Hofsiss's smart direction and fast pace give the audience little time to contemplate the play's failings, however, and an able cast gets the most out of the humor, especially the veteran star Jane Powell, who almost steals the show as the mother of one of the gay men and the pregnant woman (2:15). Century Center, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesday through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7. Tickets: $47.50 (Wilborn Hampton).</p>
        <p>*+ ''JITNEY.'' ''Don't put your business in the street,'' advises a character in this splendidly acted production of August Wilson's early comic drama about a gypsy-cab company in Pittsburgh. As if that were remotely possible in the Hill District, the setting of Mr. Wilson's cycle of plays about the black American experience in the 20th century and a place where private business is always on parade: real life is always the best show in town. ''Jitney,'' which has been extensively revised since its first production in 1982, could be described as just a lot of men sitting around talking. But the talk has such varied range and musicality and is rendered with such stylish detail that a complete urban symphony emerges. There are occasional whiffs of standard-issue melodrama. But under Marion McClinton's sensitive direction, every performer shines as a soloist and as a member of the chorus. It's the finest ensemble work of the season (2:35). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3. Tickets: $51; $21 student rush (Brantley).</p>
        <p>+ ''THE LARAMIE PROJECT.'' An enormously good-willed, very earnest and often moving work of theatrical journalism. Overseen by the director and writer Moises Kaufman, the inspired talent behind ''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' this more self-conscious production examines the impact of the brutal killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay university student, on the town of Laramie, Wyo. Eight actors play 60 characters based on interviews conducted by Mr. Kaufman and his ensemble in Laramie in the wake of the crime. The young clean-scrubbed cast is more effective in creating a general climate of feeling than in summoning authentic portraits of individuals, yet there's no denying the work's emotional pull. The overall effect is not unlike one of the candlelight vigils described here, a stately procession through which swims a stirring medley of emotions: anger, sorrow, bewilderment and, most poignantly, a defiant glimmer of hope (2:35). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Tickets: $20 to $55 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''SURFACE TRANSIT.'' It was smart of the organizers of the first New York Hip-Hop Theater Festival to make Sarah Jones's one-person play its centerpiece. Ms. Jones first presented it a couple of years ago in the East Village, and since then she and the show have grown. Among artists most respected by other hip-hop poets and performers, Ms. Jones has the clearest sense of distance; she can satirize the phenomenon in ways that open it up for people who think there is something mysterious about it. The eight characters she creates include an octogenarian who burns with the desire to be with it, whatever ''it'' is; a Russian immigrant trying to persuade her small black daughter to ignore racial slurs hurled at her by their Flatbush neighbors; a West Indian black woman with a British accent who pops into a studio for an MTV spot audition; and a white policeman who abuses women and hates gay men but could not possibly have anything against gays because his best friend from childhood ''is one of those'' (2:00). P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288. Wednesdays through Saturdays, at 8:30 p.m.; also 11 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Tickets: $25; $15 student tickets with identification (D. J. R. Bruckner).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE REAL THING'' (Tony winner for best play revival, actor and actress). This immensely appealing revival of the Tom Stoppard play, from the Donmar Warehouse in London, is rare even in what has been an exceptionally strong season for straight plays: an elegant comedy of infidelity filled with the sort of comebacks that people only wish they were capable of themselves. True, Mr. Stoppard's anatomy of a cerebral (and anachronistically romantic) playwright, played with all-conquering charm by the Tony-winning Stephen Dillane, is also always subverting itself, pointing out how some things, love among them, defy glib articulation. But, ah, how articulately it manages to say so. If its structural game-playing seems a tad too clever this time around, few comedies have managed to have it so successfully both ways. David Leveaux is the highly accomplished director. The delectable Jennifer Ehle, a Tony winner and a standout in an exceptionally polished cast, plays the self-possessed object of Mr. Dillane's affections (2:15). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $70; $15 student rush (Brantley).</p>
