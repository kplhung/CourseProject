        <p>Here's something different: a youth comedy so relentlessly sordid and depressing that it's likely to send its audience straight into the arms of the nearest psycho-pharmacologist.</p>
        <p>In fact, ''Sunset Strip'' is so different that it has been gathering dust on a shelf at 20th Century Fox for almost a year, and is now being released only to a single theater in New York, the Village East.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, of course, orphan movies turn out to be imaginative and innovative films that are just too difficult for the studio to sell.</p>
        <p>This is not one of those times. Directed by the debutant Adam Collis and written by Randall Jahnson (''The Doors'') and Russell DeGrazier, ''Sunset Strip'' seems so fundamentally misconceived that it's hard to imagine how it ever survived the first pitch meeting.</p>
        <p>Set in a low-budget version of 1972 (which means lots of orange and brown interiors and nary a single sweeping image of the Los Angeles boulevard that gives the film its name), ''Sunset Strip'' follows seven main characters through a single late summer day.</p>
        <p>Tammy (the British newcomer Anna Friel) is a clothing designer with a shop conveniently situated catty-corner from the famous L.A. rock club Whisky-a-Go-Go, which allows her to have near-simultaneous sex with an up-and-coming country rocker (Jared Leto) and a visiting Scottish superstar (Tommy J. Flanagan).</p>
        <p>Zack (Nick Stahl) is a fuzzy-faced novice guitarist who believes that Jimi Hendrix came down in a dream to designate him as his successor. He spends his day getting ready for his professional debut at the Whisky, where he'll open for Mr. Flanagan's character, and falling fruitlessly in love with an attractive older woman who lives in a mansion down the canyon.</p>
        <p>Felix (Rory Cochrane) is a booze-addled songwriter whose fondest dream is about killing himself with a mix of vodka and pills.  Shapiro (Adam Goldberg) is a hustling talent agent from the Valley with a white-boy Afro that suggests a Chia pet on steroids. And Michael (Simon Baker) is the shy, color-blind photographer whose discovery that he has caught a venereal disease from a cocktail waitress kicks off the ''La Ronde''-like plot. The infection spreads through most of the cast -- and eventually, it appears, through most of Southern California.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jahnson and Mr. DeGrazier have written the film as a series of nasty confrontations, perfunctory sex and shattering dreams, all directed by Mr. Collis with the same claustrophobic staging, shrill line readings and slack pacing. Only a knowledge of movie conventions -- she is, after all, the lead -- allows us to determine that Ms. Friel is meant to embody a grand romantic ideal; her character's actual conduct is by turns ditzy, opportunistic and cheap.</p>
        <p>Much like 1998's ''54,'' set at New York's chic nightclub of the 70's, Studio 54, ''Sunset Strip'' projects an oddly sour nostalgia, suggesting that the good old days were actually pretty awful. Maybe this is the message that teenage filmgoers, fed up with mom and dad's tales of their glorious youth, most deeply want to hear.</p>
        <p>''Sunset Strip'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong language, casual sex and prodigious substance abuse.</p>
