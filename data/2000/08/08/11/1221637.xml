        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is heartening that some communities recognize the hazards posed to our country's coastal waters by sewage and stormwater runoff (''U.S. Beach Closings Soar With Focus on Pollution,'' news article, Aug. 4). The national problem is the patchwork of varying state water-quality monitoring standards.</p>
        <p>Congress should immediately pass the Beaches Environment Assessment and Coastal Health Act (the ''beach bill'') for the sake  of beachgoers across the country. The bill would require all coastal states to adopt uniform, health-based standards for beach water quality.</p>
        <p>It would also require the updating of federal coastal water-quality standards, and would help the states set up monitoring and notification programs as needed.</p>
        <p>This legislation has been pending since 1991. Had it been enacted, we could have saved perhaps thousands of people from becoming sick by now. A day at the beach should not end with a trip to the doctor.</p>
