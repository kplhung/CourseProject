        <p>A City Hall plan to rebuild the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx as a retail complex drew more than 200 protesters to the huge, fortress-like building yesterday, where they called for new school rooms instead of chain stores on the site.</p>
        <p>Criticism of the City Hall proposal is growing from members of the Bronx clergy and the city's Democratic coalition in Congress, who say it ignores both a drastic need for classroom space in the northwest Bronx and the availability of federal school construction aid to provide it.</p>
        <p>''The mayor would do well to listen to this community,'' said Representative Eliot L. Engel, the Bronx Democrat, who attended the rally. In an interview, he said the new retail complex proposed by City Hall ''is the worst thing they could put here.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced the city's plan for the Kingsbridge Armory, a decrepit, 80-year-old structure that fills an entire block off Kingsbridge Road and Jerome Avenue, in his State of the City address in January.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, $30 million in city financing has been set aside to repair the armory's massive roof, which engineers say could collapse. The city selected RD Management, a shopping mall developer based in Manhattan, to spend $80 million or more to renovate the rest of the building for use as a recreational complex, a multiplex and at least one chain store.</p>
        <p>But almost a year before the mayor's announcement, the Northwest Bronx Community &amp; Clergy Coalition, a neighborhood group that has long advocated housing and youth programs in the neighborhoods surrounding the armory site, approached the mayor's staff with a plan to devote at least part of it to public classrooms.</p>
        <p>The group said it spent $50,000, using grants from foundations, to prepare architectural drawings showing how the armory could house 1,800 classroom seats, to be used by two or three public schools. It estimated the cost at $110 million.</p>
        <p>''The need for classroom space is tremendous, and if we miss this opportunity it gets worse,'' said Ronn Jordon, a member of the Bronx group. District 10 in the Bronx is the third most crowded in the city, according to Board of Education records.</p>
        <p>The Bronx group also approached City Hall with a suggestion for financing the project in part: a federal school construction program sponsored in 1998 by Representative  Charles B. Rangel that would make as much as $60 million a year available to New York State to build schools in poor neighborhoods where businesses or private donors agree to pick up part of the cost.</p>
        <p>''Armories are a gift, since we have to take advantage of existing structures,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''It is so sad the mayor has blinders on.''</p>
        <p>But Michael Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said the city had already given ample consideration to the proposal for schools at the armory site, and rejected the idea.</p>
        <p>''It will take a tremendous amount of money to maintain this building,'' he said, ''and its best custodian for the future is the private sector.''</p>
