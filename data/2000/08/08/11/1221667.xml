        <p>AT least two lessons can be learned from the current United Airlines fiasco, in which the airline's profits are plunging as it cancels flights and apologizes profusely to customers.</p>
        <p>First, if you want to buy somebody's cooperation, pay with cash, not with stock that may seem quite unreal to recipients who lack the right to sell it when they want. The pilots own 25 percent of UAL, United's parent company, through an employee stock-ownership plan, or ESOP. But they do not seem especially concerned that their disinclination to fly overtime is hurting the share price.</p>
        <p>Second, the old-fashioned way of having shareholders elect corporate directors may be better than the Rube Goldberg-like plan that assures that the UAL board will be made up of factions that cannot be replaced no matter how badly things are going for the company.</p>
        <p>All this stems from a 1994 recapitalization that left most of the company's stock in ESOP's for the benefit of employees, who took pay cuts. Of the 12 members of the UAL board, 5 are chosen by public shareholders, 2 by unions and one by nonunion employees. Four are independent directors who choose their own successors.</p>
        <p>It hasn't worked. To be sure, profits are up, and so is the share price. But those factors reflect the economy. UAL's share price has lagged that of its rivals since the recap. As for forecasts of a new era in cooperation between management and workers, ask a passenger marooned at O'Hare Airport by canceled flights.</p>
        <p>Just who is to blame for the sad state of affairs is debatable. United blames the pilots for not volunteering for overtime; the pilots blame United for scheduling too many flights without hiring enough pilots.</p>
        <p>This was predictable. There was no way that an ESOP could change basic attitudes. Until this year, the pilots got nothing tangible from the plan because they cannot withdraw their shares before retirement. Now the average pilot receives about $1,400 a quarter in dividends, a pittance compared with the raise the pilots' union is seeking.</p>
        <p>The pilots have other concerns. They worry that routes they could fly may be assigned instead to United's commuter airline affiliates. They fear the pending takeover of US Airways will lead to US Airways pilots getting plum jobs that United pilots would otherwise receive.</p>
        <p>None of that is very different from recent disputes at other major airlines. The UAL stock-ownership plan and convoluted corporate structure have not fundamentally altered the industry's often troubled labor relations.</p>
        <p>''I was one of the people who believed it would make a difference and that life would be better than it has been,'' Herb Hunter, a United pilot and spokesman for the pilots' union, said yesterday. ''But it doesn't seem to have made a great deal of difference in the way the company was run.''</p>
        <p>This dispute will be settled, as were earlier bitter arguments at Northwest and American Airlines. Wall Street may be right to fear that labor and antitrust issues will doom the UAL takeover of US Airways, whose shares now sell for 38 percent less than UAL's offer of $60, but UAL's profits will be good until the economy weakens. Its stock, down 36 percent this year, is likely to bounce back.</p>
        <p>Getting employees to think their success is intertwined with that of the company is a worthy goal. But some workers at UAL are angry despite being in the ESOP, and newer hires are jealous because they don't get stock. The ESOP panacea has not made UAL skies any friendlier.</p>
