        <p>Action figures often hurl invective, but seldom do they pause in mid-light-saber swipe for a bit of spiritual uplift. So it is with Bibleman, who in the video ''Shattering the Prince of Pride'' interrupts his duel with the prince to call attention to Proverbs 29:23, about a man's pride bringing him low.</p>
        <p>Pride takes a fall in the latest Bibleman adventure, his ninth, to be released on Aug. 22 by Pamplin Entertainment of Portland, Ore. Gossip, lies, fear, anger and doubt have gone down in earlier episodes. Pamplin, according to its promotional literature, ''provides products that nurture families and promote godly values.'' Long a prominent genre, Christian videos imply evangelical fervor, but this is not the case with Bibleman, who for all his biblical citations -- and each clash has one -- relies as much on reasonableness and common sense.</p>

        <p>Action figures often hurl invective, but seldom do they pause in mid-light-saber swipe for a bit of spiritual uplift. So it is with Bibleman, who in the video ''Shattering the Prince of Pride'' interrupts his duel with the prince to call attention to Proverbs 29:23, about a man's pride bringing him low.</p>
        <p>Pride takes a fall in the latest Bibleman adventure, his ninth, to be released on Aug. 22 by Pamplin Entertainment of Portland, Ore. Gossip, lies, fear, anger and doubt have gone down in earlier episodes. Pamplin, according to its promotional literature, ''provides products that nurture families and promote godly values.'' Long a prominent genre, Christian videos imply evangelical fervor, but this is not the case with Bibleman, who for all his biblical citations -- and each clash has one -- relies as much on reasonableness and common sense.</p>
        <p>Bibleman adventures involve the tribulations of young children threatened by the insidious agents of anger, pride or other hurtful spiritual conditions, as is the hero himself. Only a careful assessment of the danger and a measured response will prevail. If that sounds dire, the series keeps a dry sense of humor about itself, with tongue-in-cheek observations and asides. Each episode also takes a break for a musical number, rock to rumba. The violence, mainly light-saber duels, is jokey, and the children are kept out of it.</p>
        <p>Bibleman is played by Willie Aames, who also writes and directs the 50-minute episodes. In 1995 Pamplin proposed an action hero for a children's religious series and asked Mr. Aames, a television actor and born-again Christian, in effect to step into that phone booth and become Bibleman.</p>
        <p>''I thought this is the dumbest thing I've ever heard,'' Mr. Aames said the other day. Having considered the concept, he suggested that Bibleman not fly but ''just be a guy who does extraordinary things.'' Like Batman, in other words, albeit with intimations of Robocop. At the beginning of each episode, a distraught businessman named Miles Peterson stands in a rainstorm lamenting his empty existence. Dumping the contents of his briefcase, he flings himself to the ground and discovers a Bible buried in the mud. Miles has found the way.</p>
        <p>Like Bruce Wayne of ''Batman,'' he retires to his mansion, Eaglegate Manor, and together with his Robin, a lightly armored young man named Cipher, and a talking computer named U.N.I.C.E., he awaits spiritual calls of distress from children and their parents. Current adventures, aimed at 6- to 12-year-olds, include an archfiend who hangs out with his flunkies in the sewer, and an elaborate dressing ritual each time Miles Peterson transforms himself into Bibleman. ''Helmet of salvation,'' intones Cipher, ''breastplate of righteousness, belt of truth.''</p>
        <p>Sales are in the 75,000-cassette range for each episode, Mr. Aames said. The price is $12.99. Any proselytizing comes after the show. ''It's O.K. to be proud of our accomplishments, but not prideful in our actions,'' Bibleman says after ''Shattering the Prince of Pride.'' If children are interested in Jesus, they are advised to talk to their parents or their pastor. Then they too ''can put on the full armor of God.''</p>
