        <p>Overcoming weeks of pessimism and low expectations, the Brazilian government raised $4.04 billion today from the sale of 180 million ordinary voting shares of the state-owned oil company Petroleos Brasileiros, or Petrobras.</p>
        <p>The stock sale was one of the largest in Latin American history and was met with ravenous demand by investors in Brazil and overseas.</p>
        <p>On the Sao Paulo exchange, Petrobras shares shot up nearly 15 percent from their offering price of 43.07 reais, or $24, to close at 51.51 reais. They helped push the benchmark Bovespa index up 2 percent.</p>
        <p>The Petrobras American depository receipts, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $28.625, compared with the offering price of $24, with more than 35 million shares changing hands.</p>
        <p>''The result was quite a nice surprise,'' said Rodrigo Marques, oil analyst at Santander Investment. ''It should increase the exposure of Petrobras among international investors, which will wind up bringing a lot more resources to the company.''</p>
        <p>There had been some worry that the government had undertaken the sale too quickly, not allowing enough time for interest to build among investors. The government said, though, that the offer turned out to be 100 percent oversubscribed.</p>
        <p>Some analysts were disappointed at the price of the offer, which was well below the government's maximum price of $32 a share. The government wound up offering an additional 26.5 million shares to compensate for the lower price.</p>
        <p>Brazil's National Development Bank, which organized the sale, said that 60 percent of the shares were bought internationally, by both institutional and private investors.</p>
        <p>The Brazilian government, which still retains control over 55 percent of Petrobras, sold the stock to pay down federal debt and increase the number of investors in the former monopoly.</p>
        <p>Brazil is in the process of deregulating its energy sector, which will eventually subject Petrobras to full competition.</p>
