        <p>Vice President Al Gore surrounded himself with centrist Democratic governors from Southern states today and delivered a stem-winding populist speech in an effort to demonstrate that the South was still in play in this year's election.</p>
        <p>Alongside Mr. Gore, a Middle Tennessean and a Southern Baptist, stood his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Yankee and an Orthodox Jew whose introduction to the South came in 1963 when he helped register black voters in Mississippi.</p>
        <p>That would not have always been an alluring resume to many of the independent white Southerners whom Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman must capture in order to win states like Georgia this year. But the Democrats played up Mr. Lieberman's religion and his history today, calculating that the South had changed, that Mr. Lieberman's selection would excite minority voters, and that the ticket's centrism and religious faith  might appeal to white Southerners.</p>
        <p>At the rally in Centennial Olympic Park, Mr. Lieberman said he saw ''how good our nation can be'' when he watched his fellow student volunteers put their lives on the line to register voters in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>''Today,'' Mr. Lieberman said, ''I am so proud to stand before you as the first Jewish-American lucky enough to be a major party candidate for vice president of the United States. And when I look at Al Gore, the man who made it possible, and I think about the courage and character that went into making this decision, once again I see a glimpse of how good our nation can be.''</p>
        <p>The most recent polls, some of which are dated, show Mr. Gore trailing his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, in every Southern state except for his native Tennessee, and the race appears closer than expected there. But Gore campaign officials say Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee remain in play.</p>
        <p>Republican strategists expressed confidence today that the resurgent appeal of statewide Democratic candidates in the South would not transfer to a national election, and that Mr. Gore would not replicate President Clinton's success in winning four Southern states in 1992 and 1996.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult for national Democrats to convince Southern voters that they are similar to the moderate Democratic governors they have elected,'' said Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster here.</p>
        <p>Several of the Democratic governors disagreed, saying Mr. Lieberman's selection had been received warmly in their states.</p>
        <p>''The values people had when I was growing up -- respect of marriage and family, respect of the Sabbath, that's what they see in Joe Lieberman,'' said Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, who is completing his fourth term.</p>
        <p>Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia said the choice helped by demonstrating Mr. Gore's independence. ''Look,'' he said, ''we Southerners are not aliens from another planet. Attitudes have changed and the stereotype of the South of 50 years ago is not the South of today. And, remember, populism was born in the South.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore embraced that populist tradition today when he told the crowd he would raise the minimum wage, provide prescription drug benefits for the elderly, lower school class sizes and ''take medical decisions away from bureaucrats who work for H.M.O.'s.''</p>
        <p>''Do you remember what it was like eight years ago?'' he asked. Someone in the crowd answered, ''Pitiful.''</p>
        <p>''Pitiful, you are exactly right,'' Mr. Gore said. ''We had $300 billion annual budget deficits. That bunch had quadrupled the national debt in little over a decade. We were broke. High unemployment. We'd had the worst recession since the 1930's. We saw crime rising, families breaking up at a higher rate. All the problems were worse.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said President Clinton and he had changed things, and reminded his audience that Mr. Bush said in his nomination acceptance speech that the Democrats had ''coasted through prosperity'' and taken the path of least resistance.</p>
        <p>''I wish there had been less resistance,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I cast the tie-breaking vote after all the ones on the other side voted no for the change that was so needed. I wish there had been less resistance when they shut down the government, not once but twice. I wish there had been less resistance when we brought about the changes that have now led to a dramatic transformation in our economy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said the accusations that the last eight years had been squandered were nonsense, saying, ''If you're one of the people working in one of the 22 million jobs that have been created in this country since 1993, these haven't been squandered years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was joined today by Governors Donald Siegelman of Alabama and Paul E. Patton of Kentucky, along with Mr. Barnes and Mr. Hunt.</p>
