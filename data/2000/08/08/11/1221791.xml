        <p>SMITH-J. Morse. Of New Canaan, Connecticut, 71, died at his home on Tuesday night. He was the Chairman and CEO of the family company, H.J. Baker &amp; Bro., Inc. of Stamford which is currently celebrating its 150th year. He was the son of the late Henry V.B. Smith and the late Nancy Calder Smith. A descendant of several old Knickerbocker families, his family traces its origins in New York to the early 1620's. Mr. Smith graduated from Deerfield Academy and attended Syracuse University. He served in the Korean War where he was wounded at Heartbreak Ridge, receiving the Purple Heart. Morse began his career with H.J. Baker in 1952, bringing the business into new areas of activity with his late brother Rutger. He was an avid boater and member of the Country Club of New Canaan. Morse is survived by his wife Marilyn Williams Smith, his sons Matthew, David and Christopher, and his step-children Jack, Michael, Jeffrey and Laura Williams. He is also survived by his brother Malcolm and six Smith grandchildren and seven Williams grandchildren. A memorial celebration will be held at the First Presbyterian Church of New Canaan on Sunday, August 13 at 3PM. In lieu of flowers donations may be made to the Waveny Care Center of New Canaan or a charity of your choice.</p>
