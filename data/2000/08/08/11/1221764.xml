        <p>The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that it was beginning a new television advertising campaign for its Coca-Cola Classic brand using the slogan ''Enjoy.''</p>
        <p>Two of four commercials, all created by Cliff Freeman &amp; Partners in New York specifically for the North American market, will begin broadcasting on Monday in the United States and will be shown later in Canada. The humorous spots focus on what might happen when Coca-Cola is not available at important events like family portraits or graduation ceremonies.</p>
        <p>''Now we are not only talking about just the product itself,'' said Darryl Cobbin, vice president for consumer communications for North America at Coca-Cola in Atlanta, ''but the emotional connection people have to it.''</p>
        <p>The other two commercials will be broadcast on Sept. 15 during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>In January, Coca-Cola replaced its seven-year-old ''Always'' campaign with the ''Enjoy'' theme. The worldwide campaign, with spots that feature a parrot mimicking the drinking of cola and boys playing in a waterfall, will still be broadcast.</p>
