        <p>Thomas and the Magic Railroad  Alec Baldwin, Peter Fonda, Mara Wilson, Michael E. Rodgers and with the voices of Eddie Glen, Neil Crone, Colm Feore  Directed by Britt Allcroft  G 89 minutes</p>
        <p>Thomas the Tank Engine from the PBS children's series ''Shining Time Station'' chugs between the real-life community of Shining Time and his home base on the imaginary Island of Sodor. As always, he's trying to be really useful, and here the job is to prevent steam engines like himself from being ground to scrap by a mean diesel.</p>
        <p>Allies include Mr. Conductor (Mr. Baldwin), a miniature figure of boundless energy and cheer who transports himself between the two worlds by blowing on his whistle and disappearing in a cloud of gold dust. But pretty soon he runs out of the stuff, which consigns him to the sidelines except when he happens to be close enough to the action to hurl a bolt of his wild optimism.</p>
        <p>Anyway, on to the second problem, which is that Lady, the steam engine of all steam engines, who is counted on to save Thomas and the others, now sits stranded inside Muffle Mountain in the care of a morose gentleman named Burnett Stone (Mr. Fonda). Years earlier, Lady lost her will to produce steam when Stone let her down in a tight situation. Now some magic is needed to get her stoking, not to mention Stone, who sits staring into the fire and mumbling sorrowfully. (What did they feed Mr. Fonda?)</p>
        <p>Fortunately, Stone's granddaughter, Lily (Ms. Wilson), helps provide enough spark to get everybody back on track.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE -- None.  SEX -- None.  PROFANITY -- None.  FOOTNOTE -- Parents in tow will be fascinated by the dead-game performances of Mr. Baldwin, who adds another notch to his range, and Mr. Fonda (last sighted as a sleazy record producer in ''The Limey''), who may be a little leonine but does a passable sweet old grandpa.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?  AGES 3-8 --Thanks largely to Mr. Baldwin's gusto, the film rolls up its sleeves and gets down to business, which small children will appreciate.</p>
        <p>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps  Eddie Murphy, Janet Jackson, Larry Miller, John Ales  Directed by Peter Segal  PG-13 105 minutes</p>
        <p>Jerry Lewis invented someone similar in 1963. In Eddie Murphy movies, he's become Sherman Klump, an amiable fat-boy professor and scientific genius dogged by Buddy Love (Mr. Murphy), a lean, vile demon who erupts from inside Sherman to embarrass him at the most inopportune moments. For example, every time Sherman goes to seal the romantic deal with the lovely Denise (Ms. Jackson), out pops Buddy to make a shambles of the proceedings with his lewd shenanigans. On the podium, Buddy shocks an academic gathering by taking over Sherman and talking dirty.</p>
        <p>To get rid of Buddy, Sherman fires up several acres of lab equipment and purges himself of his Buddy gene. But there is a disastrous side effect: Sherman starts to lose his intelligence. No longer is he able to fully expound on his latest invention: a pink fluid that makes people young again. Not unreasonably, the elixir catches the attention of the pharmaceutical community, which offers Sherman's university $150 million. That, of course, interests the dean (Mr. Miller) and Buddy, now out on his own, who is determined to steal a beaker of the material from a fridge at Papa Klump's.</p>
        <p>Meet the Klumps: Granny, Mama, Papa, Young Papa and Ernie. All are played by Mr. Murphy, and occasionally they all gather to wipe out an all-you-can-eat place and cheer on Sherman and Denise. But Buddy spikes the elixir, so that now it makes everything big as well as young. Maybe it's time to put Buddy back inside Sherman.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE -- None.  SEX -- All the Klumps talk up sex, especially the elderly Klumps, who practice what they preach (thankfully not on screen, at least not graphically). Oh, yes, and a giant hamster has his way with the dean.  PROFANITY -- Along with sex, much toilet talk.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?  UNDER AGE 10 -- Common sense indicates that this isn't the best film for the small ones.  AGES 11 AND UP -- Parents should decide, but there's no real harm.</p>
        <p>What Lies Beneath  Michelle Pfeiffer, Harrison Ford, Diana Scarwid, Miranda Otto, James Remar, Amber Valletta  Directed by Robert Zemeckis  PG-13 130 minutes</p>
        <p>Odd how the front door opens by itself and won't stay closed. And a certain picture keeps toppling, breaking the glass in its frame. The dog is acting weird. Also, the tub keeps filling to the rim. Claire Spencer (Ms. Pfeiffer) is not drawing a bath, nor is her husband, Norman (Mr. Ford), a prominent university geneticist. Their daughter is away at school. So who is that woman in the steamy bathroom?</p>
        <p>''There's a ghost in my house,'' Claire tells a psychiatrist. ''I saw her in the water by the bathtub.'' The doctor advises her to get a ouija board and look into the matter. Norman, preoccupied with his work in the way people like Norman always are in this kind of movie, is both concerned about and annoyed with his wife, a budding semi-hysteric made none the calmer by too little to do around the stunning lakeside property that they have inherited from his father.</p>
        <p>When Claire first mentions sensing another presence, Norman suggests that it could be his father rattling around the house, assessing the renovations. Very funny. No, this apparition is young and blond. At first Claire suspects that it could be the woman next door, who seems to have disappeared after some nasty altercations with her husband. But when the Spencer computer turns itself on a few times, she uses it to track a set of initials and positively identify her friend in the bathroom as one Madison Elizabeth Frank, a student who has been missing.</p>
        <p>The movie makes no secret of the fact that Norman had an affair with Maddie. From there, though, you are on your own.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE -- At its climax, the film becomes extremely violent. For one thing, Claire and Norman should stay away from bathtubs.  SEX -- The neighbors may be having problems, but they are noisy love-makers. As for the Spencers, their sex life is discussed and sometimes partly in view, with discreet fadeouts. At one point Claire becomes possessed with the spirit of Maddie, which heats up the suggestiveness considerably.  PROFANITY -- Some, but it is appropriate and used sparingly.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?  UNDER AGE 12 -- This isn't for them, or shouldn't be. The violence is realistic, and the frights are too intense.  AGES 12 AND UP -- The young ran riot in ''Scream'' and the like, and here the old folks take a comparatively sedate crack at it. Drawn by the horror genre, some teenagers might be entertained by people their parents' age wheezing around that territory. Others won't be.</p>
