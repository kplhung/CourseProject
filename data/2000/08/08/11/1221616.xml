        <p>MUSEUMS, with their deep storage and archival mission, have long served as quiet graveyards for discarded art. But these days they seem to be functioning more like rehab centers.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, everything that was old and out is new and in: Norman Rockwell, Maxfield Parrish, Adolphe-William Bouguereau. The has-beens, the also-rans, the never-weres of history, the criminally neglected and the just plain criminal are being hauled out, dressed in up-to-date ideas and put back into circulation.</p>
        <p>The trend is fun, and often illuminating, almost anyone would agree. But why the salvage operation now? As always, the market must be taken into account. With A-list items in ever shorter supply, fresh material has to be found. At least as important (and by no means unconnected) is the continuing predominance of social history as the academic lens through which art is viewed.</p>
        <p>By that lens's cool analytical lights, beauty and greatness aren't inherent in objects. They are culturally based value judgments made in response to social and political needs. Technical skills may be quantifiable (which is why critics and audiences fixate on them), but the old sliding-scale grading system based on taste is, if not useless, a little beside the point. All this thinking plays a part in a smart, entertaining grandmother's suitcase of a show titled ''Noble Dreams, Wicked Pleasures: Orientalism in America, 1870-1930'' at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute.</p>
        <p>In it, a few canonical painters like John Singer Sargent rub shoulders with such half-forgotten colleagues as Henry Siddons Mowbray, Charles Sprague Pearce and Ella Ferris Pell. And everyone scrunches up to make room for Shriner hats, cigar boxes and Rudolph Valentino, all to suggest America's complex attitudes toward a specific part of the non-Western world -- the Islamic countries near the Mediterranean -- between the Civil War and the Depression.</p>
        <p>The theme is based on Edward Said's provocative 1978 book ''Orientalism,'' which indicts European, specifically French, colonialist views of Muslim Asia and North Africa as a lethal mix of racial prejudice and willful misunderstanding. Although Mr. Said's field of investigation is literature, it is easy to find supporting evidence in French paintings.</p>
        <p>Two such pictures, both by the academician Jean-Leon Gerome (1824-1904), are in the exhibition. One, ''The Snake Charmer,'' which appears on the cover of Mr. Said's book, is a skillfully wrought homoerotic fantasy with a naked light-skinned boy, dark-skinned Arabs and wall-to-wall phallic symbols, all set within a gorgeous blue-tiled room.</p>
        <p>The other painting, ''The Slave Market.'' depicts a nude girl being inspected by a turbaned man who shoves two fingers into her mouth. Essentially an image of public rape, it sums up Gerome's Orient: a benighted realm of depraved men and passive, available women. No wonder -- the message was clear -- France had to bring those people under control.</p>
        <p>Many ambitious American artists studied with Gerome in Paris; he was a major, best-selling art guru of the day. They picked up on his Orientalist subjects but changed them, customizing them for American tastes. It is in defining those differences that the exhibition, organized by a team of scholars led by Holly Edwards, a professor of Islamic art at Williams College, gains interest.</p>
        <p>The earliest painting on view, ''Jerusalem From the Mount of Olives,'' by Frederic Edwin Church, actually has nothing to do with France at all. To many mid-19th-century Americans, the Orient meant one thing: the biblical Holy Land, which they took to be a prototype for America itself, the latter-day Promised Land with a chosen people. Church saw it this way. His panoramic view of a Jerusalem washed in a kind of celestial glow is very much in the mode of his New World wilderness landscapes. In both, the perspective is one of topographical omniscience, which implies divine beneficence, but also a sense of ownership and surveillance, appropriate to a country that took Manifest Destiny as a national creed.</p>
        <p>By the time the picture was painted, though, Church's brand of moral uplift was out of date, and sexier takes on the fabled East were in place. As early as 1855, for example, the American writer Bayard Taylor (1825-1878) had a smash hit with his escapist travel book ''Lands of the Saracens,'' and boosted sales by turning up to give lectures in caftans and pointed slippers.</p>
        <p>In Paris, meanwhile, American artists were scrupulously imitating Continental styles but toning down racy subjects for the folks back home. Harem interiors and female bathing scenes, the erotic staples of French Orientalist art, are all but absent in American work, and when they appear they seem to be based on a different script.</p>
        <p>The snoozing odalisque in ''The Siesta,'' by Frederick Arthur Bridgman, a leading American Orientalist, is fully clothed except for bare ankles and arms. Apart from the presence of a monkey and hashish pipe, she might be in a suburban living room. The same artist's version of a bathing scene is a singularly unsteamy advertisement for Victorian family values, with a proud young Algerian mom watching her child splash around in a basin.</p>
        <p>In more inventive hands, Orientalism inspired some striking images. Sargent's ''Ambergris Smoke,'' a sibylline study in white and beige, is one. Another is Henry Ossawa Tanner's all-blue ''Christ Appearing to Nicodemus,'' which harks back to an older pietistic art. And Albert Pinkham Ryder, in a jewel-like painting titled ''The Scout,'' makes the single figure of a North African horseman both ethnographically accurate and as insubstantial as a mirage.</p>
        <p>Ryder, reclusive in his later years, actually traveled to North Africa once, in 1882. His New York dealer made him do it, and apparently a bad time was had by all. Louis Comfort Tiffany also made the trip, but he came down with the measles in Egypt and drove his traveling companion -- the painter Robert Swain Gifford, also in the show -- to distraction with his kvetching.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Ella Pell seems to have enjoyed roughing it. After graduating from the Design School for Women at Cooper Union, she traveled for more than five years on a modest budget through Europe, Egypt, Palestine and Turkey, sketching and writing in her journal as she went. Her drawings are small and careful, but back at home she painted an image of the Judean princess Salome that has the commanding glamour of a theater poster.</p>
        <p>In many ways, American Orientalism was all about theater, replete with costumes and props and special effects. William Merritt Chase, who never set foot in Asia, tarted up his Manhattan studio with all manner of Asian gewgaws as a promotional lure. And Church built an elaborate live-in stage set in the form of Olana, his tiled and turreted mansion over the Hudson.</p>
        <p>Artifacts from Olana are here, most of them souvenirs of the artist's travels. But with the advent of the crafts-intensive Aesthetic Movement, similar forms were adapted for American manufacture, as in the case of the outstandingly kooky ''Alhambra Pot,'' by Cordelia A. Plimpton, a member of the Cincinnati Pottery Club, and a sleek satinwood ''Moorish Desk,'' designed by Tiffany for the men-only smoking rooms that enjoyed a vogue in wealthy American homes.</p>
        <p>They are part of a jumble of objects on the museum's second floor. If this generous spread of material culture expands ''Noble Dreams'' beyond previous surveys of American Orientalism, it also deprives it of a cohesive shape and focus. (Ms. Edwards acknowledges her curatorial struggle with this problem in the catalog.) Shopper's fatigue quickly sets in, but that in itself makes historical sense in the context.</p>
        <p>By the end of the 19th century, the Holy Land of America was essentially the commodity culture of today, with its unstoppable flood of tantalizing, have-able, disposable things. Art became part of the sales pitch; Orientalist images appeared on every surface and in every form, as a mark of quality and as a guarantee of pleasure, forbidden or otherwise.</p>
        <p>Cigarettes, then a hot new concept, were given Oriental brand names like Fatima, Omar and the still-with-us Camels. Songs like ''My Turkish Opal From Constantinople'' topped the charts. A new branch of freemasonry called the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, or Shriners, drew on the combined mystification and amusement that the idea of Asia had always evoked in Americans.</p>
        <p>And then there was sex, once suppressed, now out in the open, big time, in books, fashion and ''hoochie-coochie'' dancing of the kind depicted in Robert Henri's ''Salome,'' a painting of a statuesque, bangles-and-beads, proto-Ziegfeld good-time girl. From there it was just a short step -- or a long slide, as moralists saw it -- to the movies, and the exhibition concludes with screenings of Valentino's eruptive 1921 film ''The Sheik,'' for which a brand of condoms was named.</p>
        <p>A ''That's Entertainment'' ending to the show seems far removed from Mr. Said's furious book. But it is in line with some of the catalog essays, which argue that in America Orientalism was an essentially positive and embracing phenomenon, rather than the instrument of cultural control it became in Europe.</p>
        <p>Well, maybe. But I think many of the paintings, with their tendency to validate another culture by rephrasing it in terms of Western aesthetics,  deserve a more critical reading. And  as Ms. Edwards suggests, whenever you hear non-Western art discussed, as frequently happens, in terms of  stereotypes like timelessness and universality, or as a set of attractive styles rather than a body of challenging ideas, you are on retrograde turf.</p>
        <p>That is exactly the turf, visually speaking, that ''Noble Dreams'' is all about, and it has been staked out in Williamstown with fine, self-knowing aplomb. As for the likes of the milquetoasty Bridgman and the redoubtable Pell, and the countless other artists who are no doubt in line for reclamation, as long as they serve scholarship well, as they do here, they can expect to enjoy full and useful second careers.</p>
