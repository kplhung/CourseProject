        <p>David Cone needed one more strike to complete the fifth inning of a lazy game in which the Yankees already led the Athletics by nine runs. Yet there were so many of the 41,011 fans standing and clapping and screaming that it felt as if Yankee Stadium had been transported to a taut game in October.</p>
        <p>With his father and his cancer-stricken pitching coach in attendance and with thousands of raucous people making everyone forget this was an August rout, Cone threw a fastball to Ben Grieve. Grieve missed it and Cone let go of three and a half months of frustration. He pumped his right fist, he pounded his glove and he exhaled. Finally, Cone thought, finally.</p>
        <p>Cone won a game yesterday afternoon. He won a game for the first time since April 28 as the Yankees pummeled the A's, 12-6. There were feelings of relief and bliss in Yankeeland because Cone, the creative, yet creaky, 37-year-old who had contributed so much in his four years with the Yankees before this one, ended his streak of 15 starts without a victory. Cone won a game. ''I feel like I got a large gorilla off my back,'' Cone said. ''I got rid of King Kong.''</p>
        <p>It was another emotional scene for Cone, whose father, Ed, sat in Section 215 of the main box seats just to the right of the plate. Ed Cone recalled how he had reminded his son not to get too overwhelmed, because it was simply another game. Regardless of the circumstances, the father told the son, he was just pitching in one more game, something Cone has been doing for 14 years.</p>
        <p>By the time it was over, Cone made it look like just another game for him instead of what could have been one of his final starts as a Yankee. Cone had a sturdy fastball, a sweet curveball and a nasty slider, and he stopped Oakland on two runs and eight hits in six innings while striking out eight and walking one.</p>
        <p>''It was a relief,'' said Ed Cone, who flew in from Kansas City, Mo., last Friday. ''I think the losing streak was getting to him and working on him. He was out of sync and he was pressing. This was great to see.''</p>
        <p>Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach who is undergoing treatment for cancer of the bone marrow and was expected to be away from the team for about 10 days, ignored the advice of his doctor and his wife and came to watch and tutor Cone. Stottlemyre is supposed to avoid the sun, so he found a shady spot in the bullpen during Cone's warm-ups and stayed in the dugout during the game. He has coached Cone for 11 seasons -- with the Mets and the Yankees. He had to be here.</p>
        <p>''I told him I came back especially to see him,'' Stottlemyre said, ''and I didn't come back to see a loss.''</p>
        <p>The karma was working for Cone, who called his father ''a calming influence on me,'' and said that Stottlemyre is ''the strongest man I know.'' Once the Yankees battered Mark Mulder for seven runs in two innings, it became obvious that Cone was a few innings away from ending a streak in which he had lost eight straight decisions, in which the Yankees had lost in his last 13 starts. For a game that was essentially decided, it was unusually tense because of Cone's prolonged pursuit of his second victory in 2000.</p>
        <p>Jason Giambi belted a two-run homer in the third to make it 7-2, but Jose Canseco hit a monstrous homer off the upper-deck facade in left field  and Glenallen Hill poked a two-run homer into the right-field bleachers to inflate the lead to 10-2. Still, when the first two A's singled in the fifth, some tension returned. Could Cone get through this jam? Would he crumble after being given a lead of three or more runs for only the second time during his victory drought?</p>
        <p>Cone said he got angry for the first time this season and pitched with a fury, instead of in fear. He needed four pitches to strike out Randy Velarde and got him to flail at a slider. He battled the dangerous Giambi to a 3-2 count before firing a high, tailing fastball past him. He moved to two strikes on Grieve and the fans stood and hoped that Cone would get to five innings and be in line for the victory. Cone fired the fastball, Grieve swung and Cone pumped his fist.</p>
        <p>''That's probably the best stuff I've had all year,'' Cone said. ''I had a big lead. I was thinking, 'Not again.' I turned it up a little.''</p>
        <p>He turned it up a lot.</p>
        <p>A second after Cone pumped his fist, Ed Cone did the same thing. Then Ed Cone watched his son strand two more A's to end the sixth, holding them to no hits in six at-bats with runners in scoring position.</p>
        <p>''During this streak, I thought some people had given up on him,'' Ed Cone said. ''I always thought he could still pitch. I did that for those people. I was saying, 'Yeah, he can still pitch.' ''</p>
        <p>Indeed. Cone had conquered the streak that has defined his season,  and he had conquered himself, too. Doubts plagued Cone for the last few months and he would struggle to fall asleep and get up and watch videotapes of his pitching, searching for a solution.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, in the back of your mind, you wonder if it's ever going to come,'' Cone admitted.</p>
        <p>Cone said there was a huge difference between being 2-10 and 1-11 because the Yankees are in first place and desperately need him to contribute. It was one solid start, one start that bought Cone some time to salvage a piece of his season. Cone is not delusional about his murky future, but he felt life in his arm again. And, for the first time in 104 days, Cone won a game.</p>
        <p>''I just want to enjoy today for today,'' he added. ''Tomorrow I'll wake up and still be 2-10. I'm going to enjoy today for today.''</p>
