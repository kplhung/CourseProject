        <p>Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a human rights activist who has been under investigation for his pro-democracy projects, was released on bail today after being held in prison for 45 days without being charged.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ibrahim is the founder of the Ibn Khaldoun Center for Social and Developmental Studies, which has sponsored research on Muslim-Christian relations and planned to monitor the parliamentary elections in November.</p>
        <p>He was arrested at his home on June 30. Investigators confiscated his and the center's papers, computer files and financial documents. The center has been closed by the government, as has a related organization that was formed to promote the participation of women in Egyptian elections.</p>
        <p>The chief state prosecutor, Maher Abdel-Wahid, recommended the release of Dr. Ibrahim and set bail at 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($2,915). Nadia Abdel Nour, who was Dr. Ibrahim's secretary at the Ibn Khaldoun Center, was also released on bail today; she had been in prison since June 30.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ibrahim's lawyers said that during the interrogations, prosecutors accused him of financial improprieties, defaming Egypt, accepting foreign money without government approval and disclosing information harmful to Egypt's security.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors began their investigation two months ago by accusing Dr. Ibrahim of harming Egypt by producing a short film that is meant to encourage voter participation, but also mentions past accusations of election fraud. Prosecutors also accused the scriptwriter, who was interrogated but not imprisoned, of harming Egypt.</p>
        <p>Under the Egyptian legal system, a suspect can be detained for up to 60 days without being charged. During that time the prosecutor, who also acts as the investigator, may compile criminal accusations, which may later be dropped or converted to formal charges.</p>
        <p>The detention of Dr. Ibrahim, who headed the sociology department at the American University in Cairo, prompted widespread criticism from international human rights groups and anxiety among Egypt's civic activists. State Department spokesmen have criticized the arrest and have called on Egypt to either clarify the charges or free Dr. Ibrahim.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ibrahim, speaking after his release from Tora Prison, near Cairo, said he hoped that the prosecutors' decision to set bail was a sign that the government would like to quiet the international criticism.</p>
        <p>''I have to be careful, because my case has not been closed, but I feel in my bones that they are trying to find a way out,'' he said. ''And I am grateful to them for even doing this. They've probably done more damage to Egypt's reputation than has been done in the last 20 years.''</p>
        <p>No Egyptian official had commented on the case until Wednesday, when a senior aide to President Hosni Mubarak lashed out at critics who have suggested the government wanted to silence those pushing for political openness and reform.</p>
        <p>''The case of Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim is not one of a political nature,'' the presidential aide, Osama el-Baz, said in a news conference. ''It is strictly a judicial matter. He has been investigated because of certain evidence -- not considered crucial evidence yet -- that he violated certain rules and regulations.''</p>
        <p>Under Egyptian law -- and under the laws of most Arab states -- it is a crime to defame or insult the country or its leaders.</p>
