        <p>Toys ''R'' Us and Amazon.com said yesterday that they were merging their online toy-sales units, an acknowledgment that selling toys on the Internet has been too hard for each of them alone.</p>
        <p>Starting later this year, toysrus .com will direct users to a toy section of Amazon.com. Customers will be able to use their Amazon accounts to buy toys, books, tools and other merchandise in a single order that will be shipped in one box.</p>
        <p>But Amazon's role will shift from being a store proprietor to being something more like a mall owner. Toys ''R'' Us will buy the inventory, set the prices, write the item descriptions and get credit for the revenue and any potential profits or losses. Toys ''R'' Us will pay Amazon to use its Internet site and to house the merchandise in its warehouses.</p>
        <p>''This allows both of us to reach profitability in our toy businesses significantly sooner than we would have been able to,'' said Jeffrey P. Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.</p>
        <p>The deal also helps each company avoid the more troubling aspects of its toy business.</p>
        <p>Last Christmas season, Toys ''R'' Us was hit by myriad operating problems, from crashes on its Web site to an inability to deliver toys when promised. Amazon was able to satisfy customers, but did so at a big cost. It had ordered so many toys that it had to take a $39 million writedown on its unsold inventory, a huge number relative to its total sales of toys and children's merchandise of $95 million in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
        <p>Amazon has found toys a more difficult business than books and records. They are big and expensive to ship. They must be ordered, largely from Asia, six months ahead of time, forcing a retailer to predict children's whims. And unlike books, unwanted toys cannot be returned to manufacturers for credit.</p>
        <p>Toys ''R'' Us will sell its three distribution centers, which analysts estimate it had spent $50 million to build. And Amazon will sell Toys ''R'' Us its inventory of toys. Neither company would say if a charge would be taken to cover those costs.</p>
        <p>''We are getting better, but they are three years ahead of us and we would never catch up,'' said John Eyler, chief executive of Toys ''R'' Us.</p>
        <p>Analysts praised Amazon for getting out of a tough business.</p>
        <p>''They capitulated,'' said Lauren Levitan, with Robertson Stevens. ''They needed to do something to mitigate their inventory risk and create a more predictable business for themselves.''</p>
        <p>The move is not without a cost to Amazon's image. ''I am struck by the irony of the visionary poster boy for the new economy being mated with the poster child of eroding retail brands,'' Ms. Levitan said.</p>
        <p>Peter Caruso, a retail analyst with Merrill Lynch, said the highlight of the deal was that the market for Toys ''R'' Us might not be eroding as fast as some had feared.</p>
        <p>''This tells you the success Amazon had in books is not going to be repeated in other areas, and the Internet toy market is not going to be as large as everyone thought,'' he said. ''That means that Toys 'R' Us is not going to be vulnerable sitting there with all those stores.''</p>
        <p>This vision of the toy market is vastly different from a year ago, when half a dozen companies were preparing to spend an estimated $200 million to promote online toy stores. Christmas proved to be a Waterloo for many of them, in fact. Toysmart, an online store backed by Walt Disney, failed, as did Red Rocket, a toy store owned by Viacom. And KBKids.com, controlled by KB Toys, the No. 2 store chain, has abandoned its plan for a public offering and has laid off 30 percent of its work force.</p>
        <p>''This is great news for us,'' said Toby Lenk, the chief executive of eToys, the No. 1 online toy store. ''Last year we had half a dozen competitors. Now our two remaining competitors are merging into one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lenk said he expected the steep price cutting of last year to be far less severe this Christmas. ''A lot of the players doing the insane discounting are just not here anymore,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Investors, however, were largely unmoved by the deal. Shares in Toys ''R'' Us closed unchanged at $17.375. Amazon shares slipped 43.75 cents, to $30.4375. Etoys dropped 9 cents, to $3.9375.</p>
        <p>Under the arrangement with Amazon, online customers will no longer be able to return toys to stores, as Toys ''R'' Us customers have been able to do. Conversely, though, most will no longer have to pay sales tax.</p>
