        <p>Few films have used natural light and landscape to evoke an emotional state with the insight and exquisite subtlety of Hirokazu Kore-eda's 1995 film, ''Maborosi,'' a movie that distills the profound disquiet of its main character, Yumiko (Makiko Esumi), a young widow raising a little boy.</p>
        <p>Made by the same Japanese director who had an art-house hit with the equally fine (and vastly different) ''After Life,'' the film follows Yumiko as she remarries in a match arranged by a downstairs neighbor and journeys with her son from Osaka to her new life in a remote fishing village on the Sea of Japan.</p>

        <p>Few films have used natural light and landscape to evoke an emotional state with the insight and exquisite subtlety of Hirokazu Kore-eda's 1995 film, ''Maborosi,'' a movie that distills the profound disquiet of its main character, Yumiko (Makiko Esumi), a young widow raising a little boy.</p>
        <p>Made by the same Japanese director who had an art-house hit with the equally fine (and vastly different) ''After Life,'' the film follows Yumiko as she remarries in a match arranged by a downstairs neighbor and journeys with her son from Osaka to her new life in a remote fishing village on the Sea of Japan.</p>
        <p>The movie's title, the Japanese term for ''mirage,'' ultimately implies that the longing for death is a force as unpredictable and sometimes as irresistible as the beautiful illusory light on the horizon that lures fishermen out to sea.</p>
        <p>The distilled cinematic essence of sadness, ''Maborosi'' is one of 15  movies being shown in the Film Society of Lincoln Center's 10th-anniversary tribute to Milestone Film and Video, an art-film distributor that has released some of the most distinguished new movies (along with seldom-seen vintage movie treasures) of the past decade. It will be screened  on Thursday at 4 p.m. and 8:10 p.m. and on Aug. 24 at 3:45 p.m.</p>
        <p>Bae Yong-Kyun's visionary cinematic meditation, ''Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?,'' offers equally indelible images of nature with a more pointedly spiritual resonance. The South Korean film tells the story of an aging Zen monk who is near death, his student who returns briefly to civilization, and an orphaned child, who all live together in a remote mountain monastery. Each undergoes a different and crucial life transition.</p>
        <p>The film is suffused with breathtakingly beautiful images that illustrate Buddhist spiritual concepts with an astounding metaphorical power. The film's austere but comforting philosophy can be summed up in the old monk's reflection, shortly before his death: ''I am insubstantial in the universe, but in the universe there is nothing that is not me.'' ''Bodhi-Dharma'' has two screenings today, two on Sunday and one each on Tuesday, next Friday and on Aug. 24.</p>
        <p>If ''Maborosi'' and ''Bodhi Dharma'' are transcendent examples of what might be called ''pure cinema,'' that style doesn't define all of Milestone's films. The far-ranging tribute includes Mikhail Kalatozov's ''I Am Cuba'' (1964), a fervently rhapsodic paean to the Cuban revolution, with text by Yevgeny Yevtushenko, which is much more than a historical curiosity.</p>
        <p>Other high points include ''Antonio Gaudi,'' Hiroshi Teshigahara's beautiful and nearly wordless 1985 documentary on this great Catalan architect, and the Japanese director Takeshi Kitano's much-heralded 1997 film, ''Hana Bi,'' his first to be released in the United States.</p>
        <p>Two films in the series will have their long-delayed New York theatrical premieres. The British filmmaker Roy Boulting's 1940 anti-Nazi movie, ''Pastor Hall,'' which tells the true story of a German minister whose opposition to Nazism caused him to be sent to Dachau, will be shown in a restored and uncut version. The Chilean filmmaker Rolando Klein's 1974 film, ''Chac: The Rain God,'' is the story of a Mayan tribe, plagued by a drought, whose men are led on a pilgrimage by a monklike mountain dweller to an ancient cave where they perform a chanting ceremony.</p>
        <p>The Film Society of Lincoln Center's 10th-anniversary tribute to Milestone Film and Video is at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center through Aug. 24. Admission: $9; $5 for Film Society members; $4.50 for the elderly at weekday matinees. Information: (212) 875-5600.</p>
