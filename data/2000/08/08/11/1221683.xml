        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel is unsure what to expect from his injury-plagued team when it plays tonight in Jacksonville, Fla. He just hopes he does not see the same things he saw a week ago.</p>
        <p>The first-team offense moved the ball well last week in a 20-8 preseason loss to the Chicago Bears, but the Giants failed to score a touchdown and they made many mistakes on special teams and in other parts of the game.</p>
        <p>The game tonight against the Jaguars should give Fassel a further indication of what his team will look like when it opens the season next month, but the same questions he had entering last week's preseason opener remain unanswered.</p>
        <p>There are new worries, as well. Fassel has added tight end to his list of question marks, which already included the beleaguered special teams unit and the running game.</p>
        <p>Not that Fassel is likely to get many answers. He plans to play his starters for the first half after most played a little more than a quarter last week, but he will not have everyone available.</p>
        <p>Dan Campbell is scheduled to serve as the receiving tight end for the regular-season opener against the Arizona Cardinals on Sept. 3, because Pete Mitchell will not return until at least the following week. Mitchell sprained his left knee against the Bears and had arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday that will keep him out four weeks.</p>
        <p>But a slightly strained hamstring has prevented Campbell from practicing this week, and it will keep him out of tonight's game. With Joe Jurevicius also out with a bruised shoulder, Fassel said he would use running back Sean Bennett and wide receiver Thabiti Davis, a second-year player signed as a free agent, as the tight ends in passing situations.</p>
        <p>The special teams unit is under increased scrutiny because of its abysmal effort against the Bears. It allowed a kickoff return for 65 yards and a punt return for 50 yards. Fassel has backed off his threat to make immediate changes, but said he was eager to see how the unit would perform tonight and indicated that his patience was running thin.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most intriguing matchup will be at running back, where the first-round draft pick Ron Dayne is again expected to get a heavy workload and the incumbent Joe Montgomery will finally see action. Dayne carried 17 times for 48 yards last week, and Fassel said he was not opposed to giving him the ball as frequently tonight, with Montgomery getting 10 to 15 carries. But Fassel has held off on naming Dayne, last year's Heisman Trophy winner, as his starter.</p>
        <p>Fassel said he would like to name a starting running back before the final preseason game, against the Baltimore Ravens on Aug. 25. Fassel, who intends to use both players with the first-team offense, said it was an open competition.</p>
        <p>Montgomery, as a rookie, was the leading rusher for the Giants last season, with a modest 348 yards. But a cut lip has forced Montgomery to practice with a red jersey the past two weeks, and he did not play against the Bears.</p>
        <p>The red jersey, which tells defensive players in practice to avoid hitting the player, is usually reserved for quarterbacks, and Montgomery has obviously not enjoyed the special treatment. But he vows it will not make him tentative when he takes his first hit tonight.</p>
        <p>''Just because of the color of your shirt, you shouldn't have a different mindset,'' Montgomery said.</p>
        <p>One issue that is of less concern to the coach is the development of Kerry Collins. After watching his quarterback complete 15 of 18 passes last Saturday, Fassel gushed about Collins. This week Fassel called Collins ''one of the most improved players in camp.''</p>
        <p>Fassel believes it is part of a continuing maturation and Collins agrees. ''I'm starting to see him making decisions better with the ball every time he throws it,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Collins, who has thrown 59 touchdowns and 75 interceptions in his professional career, said parts of his game are starting to come more naturally.</p>
        <p>''Last year, I did things that I equate to street ball, just winging it,'' Collins said. ''Knowing where everybody is makes you feel comfortable that you're going to make the pass.''</p>
        <p>Without Mitchell and Jurevicius, Collins's prime targets will be Amani Toomer, Ike Hilliard and Tiki Barber. But Fassel said that he would not restrict play selections against the Jaguars, because the two teams will not meet again until the final game of the regular season. The Giants are promising a more open attack under the new offensive coordinator Sean Payton, and last week the team even ran a double reverse against the Bears.</p>
        <p>Fans will continue waiting for the Giants' debut of linebacker Mike Barrow (sprained knee). Yesterday, Fassel said that fullback Greg Comella (tight back), offensive guard-tackle Mike Rosenthal (shoulder), defensive tackle Keith Hamilton (strained hamstring) and safety Shaun Williams (toe sprain) would not play tonight.</p>
