        <p>Diners who have mastered the Brasserie's glass staircase can apply their skill at a new, even more flamboyant catwalk, the orange-carpeted semi-spiral at Brasserie 8 1/2. The name has nothing to do with Fellini. It's an allusion to the restaurant's location, a floor below 9 West 57th Street. There's nothing half about the design, by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer. The staircase, in an enormous circle cut out of the ceiling, leads to a bar and lounge perfectly suited to a space station. The dining room, with deep tufted-leather booths, velvet-lined walls and a cast-glass ceiling, leads to a brightly colored back-lighted glass panel by Fernand Leger. Restaurant Associates, which runs both the Brasserie and Brasserie 8 1/2, seems to be drunk on design. Their latest production makes the Brasserie look almost timid.</p>
        <p>Julian Alonzo, most recently the executive chef at Cafe Centro, has taken license with the brasserie concept. The menu includes dead-center traditional dishes like onion soup gratinee, bouillabaisse and steak frites, but little adventures beckon even on some of the more old-fashioned dishes, like the oxtail marmalade that comes with grilled hanger steak and mashed potatoes, and the poached quail eggs that top off the frisee aux lardons. Even the banana split is not what it seems. It's a complicated dismantling and reassembling, with caramelized banana folded into a layered pile of whipped cream, macerated strawberries and thin-sliced pineapple and topped by three miniature scoops of vanilla, strawberry and chocolate ice cream.</p>

        <p>About half the menu heads off into nontraditional territory, with appetizers like baby squid stuffed with chorizo and surrounded by half-moons of sliced avocado and brightly colored melon balls; tuna tartare with a layering of wasabi and flying-fish roe; and foie gras ravioli in a cauliflower sauce flavored with vanilla oil.</p>
        <p>Like the Brasserie, Brasserie 8 1/2 offers a daily special, starting Monday with seared diver scallops with fava bean puree and chanterelles and finishing up on Saturday with a double threat: roasted rack of lamb and a cassoulet of summer beans.</p>
        <p>Prepare to be surprised. On a recent evening, the kitchen sent out a predessert of frozen sangria, accompanied by a tiny spoon filled with a dollop of torta del casar cheese. It worked. Or at least it seemed to fit the decor.</p>
        <p>Brasserie 8 1/2, 9 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 829-0812. Dinner entrees, $18 to $34.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 17, 2000, Thursday  The Diner's Journal column in Weekend on Aug. 11, about the Austrian chef Kurt Gutenbrunner and his new Manhattan restaurant, Wall se, misstated the site of Tantris, a restaurant where he once cooked. It is in Munich, not in Vienna.</p>
