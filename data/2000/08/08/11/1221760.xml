        <p>BRONX: COCAINE SEIZED -- Federal agents yesterday announced the seizure of nearly 670 kilograms of cocaine in the Bronx on Saturday. They said that agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and New York City police officers arrested three men and charged them with drug trafficking after searching a van and finding 50 kilograms of cocaine. The other 619 kilograms were discovered during a search of a nearby apartment.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: VIRUS RESEARCH FINANCING CRITICIZED -- In a letter to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Senator Charles E. Schumer has complained that New York is not getting enough money to track the West Nile virus. He said that this year, the centers would distribute about $6.9 million nationwide for such monitoring, but that New York's share would be only $720,000, or about one-tenth of the total. The Centers for Disease Control did not return a phone call seeking comment yesterday. Meanwhile, the Suffolk County health commissioner, Clare B. Bradley, said that it was likely that ''West Nile virus is present throughout Suffolk County.''</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: MAN BEATEN AT HOME -- A man was badly beaten by a burglar at his home yesterday, the police said. The man's wife returned to their West 81st Street apartment at 6:50 p.m. and found her husband, Jack Kravitz, 57, beaten in the head and face, an investigator said. The attack is not thought to be linked to seven other violent burglaries on the Upper West Side, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman. Mr. Kravitz was in critical condition at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: WOMAN TELLS OF TRAIN ACCIDENT -- A woman who was thought to have jumped in front of a train that tore off her leg on July 31 has recovered consciousness and on Monday told detectives she was pushed onto the tracks by a robber, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman. The woman, Buo Yu You, 55, of Delancey Street was hit by a J train at the Bowery station. Ms. You, who also suffered head injuries, was in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital Center last night, the authorities said.</p>

        <p>YAPHANK: ORGANIC GOLF COURSES -- Suffolk County has agreed to build two 18-hole public golf courses here without using pesticides. Robert L. Garfinkle, an assistant county attorney, said the courses would be among the first in the country to use organic methods from their inception. The action stems from a lawsuit brought by the Long Island Neighborhood Network of Massapequa, which said the original plans for the golf courses, which are to be built on public land, failed to comply with state environmental law.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: MANY CASES, ONE TRIAL -- A judge ruled yesterday that she would hold one trial for a Manhattan man, Arohn Kee, charged with three murders and four rapes in Harlem, despite protests by the man's lawyers that he would not get a fair trial because of the complexity and volume of evidence. Justice Joan Sudolnik of State Supreme Court in Manhattan said asking witnesses to testify in four trials would be too much.</p>

        <p>WHITE PLAINS: UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS SCHEME -- In the latest crackdown effort on those who illegally claim unemployment benefits, the Westchester County district attorney has accused 22 Westchester residents who have jobs of stealing a combined $78,000 in benefits from the State Labor Department. Each defendant faces up to four years in prison. The defendants allegedly collected benefits ranging from $1,711 to $9,490 between June 1997 and January of this year, said Jeanine F. Pirro, the district attorney.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: CHILDREN'S INSURANCE -- New York is among the states with the most success in enrolling children in the federal Children's Health Insurance Program, according to a new report from the Children's Defense Fund. With 453,000 enrollments in the government insurance program, New York is in fourth place, behind Alaska, Massachusetts and Maryland, the report found.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: NEW CHIEF FOR CABRINI HOSPITAL -- Paul J. Candino has been named president and chief executive of Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan, succeeding Jeffrey Frerichs, who resigned in July. Mr. Candino will continue as president and chief executive of Prism Network Inc., a corporation that specializes in developing health care systems for insurance companies.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Steinhauer (NYT)</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN: CHARGES IN BANK ROBBERIES -- Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn charged 13 men yesterday with being part of a mob-connected robbery ring that broke into nearly 30 banks from Long Island to Florida between 1992 and 1999, stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from vaults and deposit boxes. One man, George Ludwigsen of Boca Raton, Fla., is the younger brother of Chris Paciello, a Miami nightclub owner who is to go on trial next month on charges of bank robbery and murder.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>HARTFORD: DELAY URGED FOR TRIBAL RECOGNITION -- After two days of talks in Washington about the federal government's plan to recognize two Connecticut Indian tribes, the state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, has urged the Interior Department to postpone its decision. Numerous questions remain about the tribe's claims, Mr. Blumenthal said. The Interior Department research used to determine whether the tribes, the Eastern Pequots and the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots, deserve formal recognition is flawed, he asserted. Tribal recognition carries several benefits, including potential casino ventures. The Bureau of Indian Affairs did not return a phone call seeking comment.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: UTILITY BILLS FOR THE POOR -- A group called New Jersey Citizen Action wants state regulators to allow utilities to charge low-income customers a fixed percentage of their income when they pay their utility bills. Poor people typically must devote 10 to 13 percent of their income to utilities, leading to more than 100,000 disconnections because of unpaid bills, the group said. Under the plan, low-income customers would pay 3 percent of their income. In return, the utilities would get some money instead of none and would keep families from using potentially dangerous alternatives like kerosene lamps.</p>
