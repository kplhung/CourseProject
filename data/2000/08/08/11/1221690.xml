        <p>ALBATROSS. That was the word David Cone volunteered after beating the Oaklands yesterday, his first victory since all the way back on April 28.</p>
        <p>Asked what exactly the concept of albatross meant to him, Cone put his hands to his neck and made the gesture of removing a heavy weight.</p>
        <p>He was, as usual, absolutely right. In his own fevered mind, Cone had become a latter-day version of the haunted character in the poem ''The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,'' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834).</p>
        <p>The Yankees had lost 13 straight games in which Cone had started, a streak of epic proportions for an organization that normally commits professional euthanasia upon a pitcher who has not won recently. However, Cone is special, and deserved these three months of faith. For all the kind thoughts, Cone was adrift in uncharted waters, bumming himself out and concerned he was dragging down his teammates' morale. He could imagine the Yankees reacting to him the way strangers responded to the cursed mariner. As Coleridge wrote:</p>
        <p>I fear thee and thy glittering eye,</p>
        <p>And thy skinny hand, so brown.</p>
        <p>Cone had not slayed the revered sea bird, with its 10-to-12-foot wing spread, thereby bringing down the wrath of a rainless sky and a becalmed sea upon an entire ship. Perhaps Cone's transgression has been turning 37, or something so mundane as fouling up his mechanics. In baseball terms, either can be a cosmic hex. He had eight losses and seven no-decisions to show for his last 15 starts,  even on a team of power and depth, leading its division.</p>
        <p>Water, water, every where, nor any drop to drink.</p>
        <p>Losing streaks like this are a mere trifle on other clubs. The Mets, in  their erratic glory, have not only Anthony Young's 27 consecutive losses  over 1992-93, but Craig Anderson's 19 straight losses over their first  three seasons, to say nothing of Roger Craig's 18 straight in 1963. The Bronx single-season record for consecutive losses is a mere 11 by one George Mogridge in 1916, before the Yankees were the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Cone wanted no part of that. He is a complex chap under the best of circumstances, opening himself up to the press but also known to retreat into literal or figurative darkness.</p>
        <p>''I've tried everything to the point of overdoing it,'' he said of his mental and spiritual gyrations during the streak. ''I now understand how  athletes can exacerbate a slump.''</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the skipper of this luxury liner, said he did not realize how gravely Cone needed a victory ''until he said it,'' Torre said, heavy emphasis on the ''he.''</p>
        <p>Nearly as bad as actually losing games, Cone began to fear that whatever he had might be catching. ''My streak has been an albatross on the whole team,'' he said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Nonsense, said some of the Yankees, including Tino Martinez, who added: ''He carried himself very well on the days he didn't pitch. He was obviously frustrated the day he pitched, but he's been a great teammate.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees tried everything short of incantations over Cone's uniform and toeplate, even sending him down to the noted exorcist, Professor Connors of Tampa. The Ancient Mariner did indeed bring disaster to his shipmates, but this tale takes a happier tack with David Cone and the Yankees. A fresh new platoon of bashers clubbed Oakland into submission yesterday, for an ultimate 12-6 victory. Cone pitched six innings, gave up two runs and had reason to be encouraged.</p>
        <p>A spring of love gushed from my heart,</p>
        <p>And I blessed them unaware.</p>
        <p>Cone might have said that, if Coleridge had not written those words two centuries ago.</p>
        <p>He said he thought he had turned the corner when he began to ''get angry'' on the mound yesterday, finding a familiar source of energy. He struck out three opponents with two runners on base in the fifth inning, and punctuated it with a pump of his fist. He was ahead, 10-2, and he could see wind in his personal sails, although morbidity runs deep.</p>
        <p>Since then, at an uncertain hour,</p>
        <p>That agony returns:</p>
        <p>And till my ghastly tale is told,</p>
        <p>This heart within me burns.</p>
        <p>For Cone, the agony was temporarily obscured yesterday, but he maintained his own view of the world. ''Tomorrow I'll wake up and still be 2-10,'' he said. ''But right now. . . .''</p>
        <p>The ancient mariner would have understood.</p>
