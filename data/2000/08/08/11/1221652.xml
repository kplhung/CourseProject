        <p>PITY the poor communicators at Verizon Communications.</p>
        <p>Just as they were beginning their push this month to rebrand the telecommunications giant, formed by the merger in June of Bell Atlantic and GTE, they found their attention -- and that of the public and the media -- drawn to other, more compelling events.</p>
        <p>Like the strike by the company's 86,000 employees, which began early Sunday morning, and which has been marked by scattered acts of violence and vandalism. And Verizon's acquisition, announced Tuesday, of NorthPoint Communications, an Internet access provider. Not to mention the plunge in Verizon shares that greeted that announcement, as well as the company's admission, also made Tuesday, that it would not meet earnings expectations.</p>
        <p>In normal times, of course, any one of these events would be enough to keep any company's advertising and public relations departments spinning. But have they in fact slowed the branding effort, one that Janet Keeler, Verizon's senior vice president for marketing services and brand management, says ''may well be the largest renaming campaign ever undertaken?''</p>
        <p>No, insists Ms. Keeler.</p>
        <p>''Everything is still going on as scheduled,'' she said. That includes the printing this month of the first set of bills with the Verizon name to be sent to customers and the reprogramming of the greetings and closings heard by subscribers when they place operator-assisted, credit card or collect calls (James Earl Jones delivers many of these messages, just as he did in the past for Bell Atlantic).</p>
        <p>The replacement of signs on buildings and on telephone booths is also continuing, Ms. Keeler said, as well as the repainting of company trucks. None of this work is affected by the strike, she added, ''because it is outsourced.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Keeler distinguished the Verizon rebranding from that of Verizon Wireless, a joint venture formed in April between Bell Atlantic Mobile and Vodafone AirTouch, to which GTE's cellular operations were added once the main Verizon merger was completed in June. That campaign started in May, she said, ''and is all finished except for some of the stores.''</p>
        <p>She also differentiated the present renaming operation from what she called the main ''repositioning'' campaign for Verizon, scheduled for the fall, ''probably October.'' That effort will result in ''the new statement of what Verizon stands for,'' she said. ''We're still working on it.''</p>
        <p>Verizon is also working on the choice of agencies it will use in the fall branding campaign, Ms. Keeler said, noting that the new company is ''continuing to get experience with all the GTE and Bell Atlantic agencies,'' which include the Lord Group in New York, Arnold Communications in Boston, and Burrell Communications, in Chicago, for Bell Atlantic, and Ogilvy &amp; Mather in New York and Dallas, and Dallas-based Temerlin McClain for GTE.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, though, a raft of print advertisements and television and radio spots has already begun running in the areas where Verizon has a so-called wire-line presence, comprising 31 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. And some of the print ads feature company employees like Debbie Adams, a splicer in New York City, and Andrea Lenoir, an assistant marketing manager in Dallas, all of them said to be ready to provide the ''same dedicated service'' to customers as they did when they worked for Bell Atlantic or GTE.</p>
        <p>''Our employees take center stage in this first campaign because they are the face of the new Verizon,'' Ms. Keeler was quoted as saying in a news release on July 31, just before the ads broke and a week before the strike. ''They are the ones who build relationships with customers, and they are the ones who deliver on our promises to customers.''</p>
        <p>Of course, they are also the ones who are now walking the picket lines and, in some cases, jeering at the company's management. And that makes for ''a rocky start,'' said Peter Dixon, senior partner at Lippincott &amp; Margulies, a corporate identity consulting company owned by Marsh &amp; McLennan. His firm actually helped think up the name Verizon, but is not involved in the branding effort. The situation is especially difficult, he said, ''because one of the issues they are raising is the importance of the people who work for them.''</p>
        <p>Jeff Miller agrees. He is a spokesman in Washington for the Communications Workers of America, whose members include the workers now on strike against the company. ''It really is ironic,'' he said, ''because it is true that our people are the face of the company. And the issues they are fighting for have to do with providing better customer service.''</p>
        <p>That may be. Because of the labor conflict, however, management has begun considering whether its unionized workers are its best ambassadors after all, and whether the advertisements featuring them should ''stay in rotation,'' according to Ms. Keeler.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dixon believes that pulling the ads or ignoring the strike -- and the employees -- would be a mistake. ''It's better to talk about this and even to give the employees credit before they settle the strike,'' he said. ''Any kind of vindictiveness or slight to the employees now would be the wrong thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning, near Times Square, there was a hint that Mr. Dixon might be right. A group of about three dozen strikers, wearing red C.W.A. T-shirts and headed for a union rally at Verizon's New York headquarters a block away, stood waiting to cross Broadway at 42nd Street. They jeered the Verizon billboard diagonally across the intersection, which said, ''Bell Atlantic has a new name.'' The sign depicted several shots of a worker in a hardhat with a logo that changed from Bell Atlantic's to Verizon's.</p>
        <p>''Who is that dork?'' one C.W.A. worker shouted. Another crumpled a cardboard coffee cup and hurled it toward the billboard. It was a purely symbolic gesture, since the cup made it barely halfway across the intersection, but it drew cheers from the group all the same.</p>
        <p>Behind them, two women passers-by shouted encouragement. ''Stick it to 'em!'' one called out, then turned to her companion and said: ''That big company, with all that money! These guys shouldn't have to be out here.''</p>
