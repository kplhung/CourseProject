        <p>The Patriots signed cornerback Otis Smith, three days after the Jets waived him to trim their roster.</p>
        <p>The move reunites Smith with Bill Belichick, the former Jets defensive coordinator and current Patriots coach, whom Smith played under for the past five seasons.</p>
        <p>Smith, 34, missed all but one game last season because of a broken left collarbone. Before the injury, he had started 32 games in a row for the Jets.</p>
        <p>Smith has started 53 of 119 career games, recording 278 tackles and 20 interceptions, returning 5 for touchdowns. He signed with Philadelphia as an undrafted rookie out of Missouri in 1990, joined the Jets as a free agent before the 1995 season and was waived two games into the 1996 campaign.</p>
        <p>He then signed with Coach Bill Parcells's Patriots, starting 6 of their final 11 games. When Parcells, now the Jets' director of football operations, left New England in 1997 to coach New York, Smith followed. He had spent the past three seasons with the Jets. (Bloomberg News)</p>
        <p>URLACHER IS DEMOTED: All the praise in the world could not help Brian Urlacher remain a starter for the Bears.</p>
        <p>Urlacher, the ninth overall pick in the 2000 draft, whose skills and intensity drew comparisons to great Bears linebackers of the past, was replaced in the starting lineup by Rosevelt Colvin after Tuesday's practice.</p>
        <p>''It's because I didn't play very well and Rosie was playing better,'' Urlacher said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Bears named Urlacher as the starter on the strong side almost immediately upon drafting him out of New Mexico, where he seemed to play all over the field.</p>
        <p>Coach Dick Jauron said Urlacher would still see plenty of playing time, mostly in nickel and dime packages. (AP)</p>
        <p>SUSPENSION UPHELD FOR BATES: The National Football League upheld yesterday its one-game suspension of Cardinals running back Mario Bates for violating the league's new anti-violence policy.</p>
        <p>Bates pleaded guilty on June 9 to misdemeanor charges for slapping his girlfriend in the face on March 14. The league's new policy states that suspension without pay is mandatory for a conviction or guilty plea for violent crimes.</p>
        <p>Bates appealed his suspension but the Cardinals said they were informed yesterday that the appeal was denied by the N.F.L. executive vice president Jeffrey Pash.</p>
        <p>Bates was sentenced in Scottsdale municipal court to two years' unsupervised probation, fined $364 and ordered to participate in a domestic nonviolence program. He also was ordered to have no ''uninvited contact''with his girlfriend. (AP)</p>
