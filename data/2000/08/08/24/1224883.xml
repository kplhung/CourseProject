        <p>Few directors in the 1960's and 70's rivaled Arthur Penn. His Broadway shows included successes like ''Two for the Seesaw,'' ''The Miracle Worker,'' ''Toys in the Attic'' and ''All the Way Home.'' His work in Hollywood was equally celebrated, with inventive movies like ''Alice's Restaurant,'' ''Little Big Man,'' ''The Miracle Worker'' and the enduring classic ''Bonnie and Clyde.''</p>
        <p>And then in the mid-80's Mr. Penn's film career seemed to shrink. A bad experience or two in Hollywood, his decision to live in New York and not Los Angeles and, most important, the lack of interest among studios in his socially aware films soured Mr. Penn on the movie business.</p>
        <p>''It was frustrating and more than a little humiliating,'' said the trim 77-year-old director, who seems a decade younger. His more recent experience in the theater was not much better. Mr. Penn said he had found that Broadway seemed more hospitable to blockbuster musicals than to serious drama.</p>
        <p>So it was a shock, Mr. Penn said, when Dick Wolf, creator of NBC's ''Law and Order'' and one of television's foremost producers, asked the director to dinner in New York and offered him the job of executive producer on that show. Mr. Penn's pay for the season is likely to top $1 million, talent agents said.</p>
        <p>Given that television is flagrant in its discrimination against writers and producers over 50, Mr. Wolf's decision to appoint Mr. Penn is a virtual breakthrough for the elderly. ''I think there's this vast pool of guys who have had incredible careers and are much more talented than a lot of people who are having movies green-lit right how,'' Mr. Wolf said.</p>
        <p>The average age of the writing staff on ''Law and Order'' is 46, he said. ''That's ancient on television,'' said Mr. Wolf, who is 53. ''But I'm doing dramas, not 'Friends.' For serious writing, miles on the odometer are beneficial.'' (For the second season in a row, Mr. Wolf is also using 69-year-old Ted Kotcheff, director of ''North Dallas 40,'' as executive producer of NBC's ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.'')</p>
        <p>In his new job, Mr. Penn, who has made a handful of television films, will oversee the creation of each episode of ''Law and Order,'' working mostly with the directors and actors. Mr. Penn's son, Matthew Penn, is one of the directors on the show, which revolves around the police and a district attorney's office in New York. Mr. Wolf recalled, ''When Ed Sherin, who had been doing this job for seven years, decided to leave, it was, like, who do you get to replace someone who was that integral to the daily running and daily success of that show?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolf said that Lewis Gould, one of the show's producers, came to him and said, ''You know who Matt's Dad is -- Arthur Penn.''</p>
        <p>''And I said, 'Wow, what a great idea,' '' Mr. Wolf continued. ''So I had dinner with him, and when we had coffee I said to him, 'Do you want to run ''Law and Order''?' And he said yes. As you can tell, it was a very complicated negotiation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolf said that what appealed to him about Mr. Penn was his obvious experience and talent working with stage actors. The cast of ''Law and Order'' includes such theater actors as Sam Waterston, Jerry Orbach and, starting in the fall, Dianne Wiest. (She will replace Steven Hill, who played a district attorney.)</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Mr. Wolf said, Mr. Penn's signature in his early television movies, as well as ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and other films, was focusing a sociological lens on various moments in American history. ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' he said, was not merely a film about some lovers on a crime spree, but a film about the Depression. ''His pictures operate on two levels -- and we needed that for this show,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Penn described his role on ''Law and Order'' as serving, in a sense, as a mentor to the show's directors. Directing episodes has no interest for him, Mr. Penn said.</p>
        <p>''I would rather be available to the young directors and be able to talk to them about the possibilities,'' he said. ''A lot of directors in television have come up through the technical ranks. They have all the technical skills in the world. They're not all that familiar with actors. And on 'Law and Order' you have wonderful racehorsy actors like Sam Waterston, Jerry Orbach and, now, Dianne Wiest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Penn, who talked about his new job in a breakfast interview at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, has lived for decades with his wife, Peggy, a therapist, in a duplex apartment on Central Park West and in Stockbridge, Mass. Aside from their son, they have a daughter, Molly, a former arts administrator at Lincoln Center, and four grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Mr. Penn said he had always considered himself closer to the theater than films. His career began in the 1950's in live television, but his only television work in recent years was directing a drama, ''Inside,'' about apartheid in South Africa, for the Showtime cable network.</p>
        <p>Although his words are shaded in bitterness when he talks about the movie business, Mr. Penn spoke quietly and with some humor. Of the film studios, he said, ''I didn't particularly like what they are doing, so it was a very amicable divorce in that respect.'' He shrugged at the notion of meeting studio executives in their 20's and 30's and recalled the famous Hollywood anecdote about the time that Fred Zinnemann, the director of ''From Here to Eternity,'' ''The Nun's Story,'' ''A Man for All Seasons'' and other classics, had a meeting with a young studio executive.</p>
        <p>The executive said, ''So Mr. Zinnemann, what have you done?'' And the director responded, ''What have you done?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Penn laughed briefly. ''That's the way it is.'' But then he added: ''In a sense that's how I was responded to out here. I hadn't ever been part of the Hollywood community, so I didn't have all these friendships with movie stars who are getting pictures made. I wasn't Tom Cruise's buddy or Matt Damon's buddy. Not to single them out. But there's a kind of buddy relationship that goes on now in terms of getting pictures made.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Penn still seemed unsettled by his experience on the 1966 western ''The Chase,'' with Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda and Robert Redford. While Mr. Penn was rehearsing the play ''Wait Until Dark'' on Broadway, the film's producer, Sam Spiegel, took over the editing of ''The Chase'' in London.</p>
        <p>''It was a pretty abusive experience for a lot of people,'' Mr. Penn recalled. ''I really lost my appetite for movies for quite a while.''</p>
        <p>Over the years he has taught at Yale and periodically directed films and plays. For the past six years he has been president of the Actors Studio in New York, where he has developed a successful graduate program.</p>
        <p>Broadway, he feels, is too dependent on mega-musicals like ''Cats'' and ''Miss Saigon,'' with the result that talented writers have turned elsewhere. ''The vigor of the playwrights is somewhere Off Broadway now,'' he said. ''And what's happened is a whole generation has bypassed New York and theater and come out here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Penn's film work also includes ''The Left-Handed Gun'' (1958), ''Mickey One'' (1965), ''Night Moves'' (1975), ''The Missouri Breaks'' (1976) and ''Four Friends'' (1981).</p>
        <p>Warren Beatty, who starred in ''Mickey One'' as well as ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' said of Mr. Penn, ''He has the soul of an artist.'' He added, ''His intelligence is the factor that resonates most strongly, his intelligence and a lack of interest in pandering.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Penn acknowledged that some of his later films were disappointments and that studios lost interest in the social topics that fascinated him. ''In each instance there was a certain social comment about conditions that were prevalent at the time,'' he said. ''There doesn't seem to be that kind of social concern now.'' Instead, he said, he sees the country as ''just sort of without issues.''</p>
        <p>Certainly Mr. Penn's most enduring film -- and one that redefined crime movies with, among other techniques, its use of slow motion -- was ''Bonnie and Clyde'' (1967), about the Depression-era bank robbers. The film, which starred Mr. Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Gene Hackman and Michael J. Pollard, almost died after it was released. Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, said it was ''as pointless as it is lacking in taste.'' And Newsweek called it ''a squalid shoot-'em-up.'' But a rave review by Pauline Kael in The New Yorker and a drumroll of interest among college students turned the film into a cultural phenomenon. ''Time magazine panned the movie in a brief review and five months later put it on the cover,'' Mr. Beatty said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Penn recalled with a laugh how Mr. Beatty, as producer of the film, manipulated Jack Warner, the studio chief, into supporting it. ''Jack Warner didn't like the film, couldn't figure it out at all,'' Mr. Penn said. ''Warren was very clever. He told him that the film was an hommage to the gangster films of Warner's past. And Jack Warner said, 'What's an hommage?' ''</p>
