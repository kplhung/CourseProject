        <p>THE tiny lady with the gray bun and the slight Russian accent shook her head, remembering that day, 46 years ago, when she first saw the 16-room rental apartment with the heart-stopping panoramic view of Central Park.</p>
        <p>''I actually hesitated,'' she said, then laughed. ''I hesitated for three weeks, and then finally my husband asked me why I wasn't sure and I realized it was all the dark paneling. 'But you can paint it white!' he said. And so we did.''</p>

        <p>THE tiny lady with the gray bun and the slight Russian accent shook her head, remembering that day, 46 years ago, when she first saw the 16-room rental apartment with the heart-stopping panoramic view of Central Park.</p>
        <p>''I actually hesitated,'' she said, then laughed. ''I hesitated for three weeks, and then finally my husband asked me why I wasn't sure and I realized it was all the dark paneling. 'But you can paint it white!' he said. And so we did.''</p>
        <p>Thus began a love affair with a rambling space at the top of the Prasada, an elegant prewar Beaux Arts apartment house at 50 Central Park West, at 65th Street, in Manhattan. It was a love affair during which she and her husband, a businessman, gave hundreds of receptions and parties and benefits. A place where countesses and princes and ambassadors were entertained. It was a place where one of her daughters took flamenco lessons from Jose Greco. A place with its own penthouse studio, where Russian artist-friends came to create their sculptures and paintings.</p>
        <p>Yet now, after all those years, the lady -- she requested that her well-known name not be used -- has decided to sell her apartment, which is actually two separate but adjoining apartments, both bought after the building went co-op in the early 70's. (Her grandson called the mostly vacant second apartment, overlooking the Hudson River and Lincoln Center, ''the fanciest mini-storage in town,'' said Alexander Peters of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate, the listing agent.)</p>
        <p>The price is $15 million. It includes 4,000 square feet of terrace, or about two-thirds of the building's roof, Mr. Peters said. Altogether, there are six and a half baths -- most in original condition, complete with pedestal sinks and deep tubs. There are two kitchens -- one with its original wood and glass cabinets and the other newly redone with white au courant appliances and Formica counters.</p>
        <p>The owner is moving to a smaller apartment with many of the same spectacular views, just one floor down. Her husband died in January, she explained, ''and the 10,000 square feet was getting a little too much -- I had to shrink, but I don't like it.''</p>
        <p>She paused. ''I wish I weren't going,'' she said, gazing around. She hopes the eventual buyer will entertain as enthusiastically as she and her husband did.</p>
        <p>''It was all so international,'' she continued. ''I especially remember the Hungarian women, so beautiful, so well mannered, and they always kissed the hostess! They were about double my height.''</p>
        <p>''It was a salon, but we did not plan it that way,'' she said. ''People said, 'Where could these wonderful people come to talk?' and we said, 'Oh, they can come here.' I never did ask why; I just asked when.''</p>
        <p>The couple raised two daughters in the vast apartment; they had moved from a grand villa overlooking Repulse Bay in Hong Kong because they wanted the girls to attend Barnard College. The daughters are shown in the leather photo albums: playing the two grand pianos in the 30-by-15-foot drawing room, studying at small desks in one of the six bedrooms.</p>
        <p>Generally, the whole family participated in the postwar social whirl.  ''But once, one of my daughters said she thought we were overdoing it,'' the owner said, smiling. ''Why? Because after a party one of the men she knew had asked where should he send the check -- I guess he thought it was another benefit!''</p>
        <p>Although she and her husband regularly entertained 200, the building was so solid, neighbors never complained, she said, adding, ''It is like a fortress; even people rehearsing Spanish dances, no one hears them.''</p>
        <p>The room has more space than meets the eye, she added, standing at one end of the drawing room, with its 14-foot ceilings and baronial fireplace. ''You can fit 54 chairs and two pianos in here,'' she said, and pulled out the photo albums to prove it.</p>
        <p>''The roof had a Greek temple on it,'' she said. ''It's gone now, but people with imagination could put it back.''</p>
