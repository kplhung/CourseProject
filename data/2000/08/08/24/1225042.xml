        <p>Max Capital Management Corporation, one of the largest commercial landlords in New York City, sold a 16-story building in the garment district  this week to S. L. Green Realty for $50.5 million, $20.5 million more than it paid for the property only three years ago.</p>
        <p>Like other real estate companies, Max Capital bought and renovated relatively cheap, battered buildings in the garment district during the late 1990's and then rented the space to upscale tenants fleeing the rapidly escalating Midtown rents.</p>
        <p>In 1997, Max Capital and its partner Angelo, Gordon &amp; Company, bought the 250,000-square-foot building at 1370 Broadway, at the southeast corner of 37th Street, from Nathan Aber. The company replaced some tenants, and rents jumped to $40 a square foot, from $17.</p>
        <p>Adam Hochfelder, the president of Max Capital, said the offer was too good to pass up.</p>
