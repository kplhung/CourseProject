        <p>A year ago, the Gerritsen Creek salt marshes on Jamaica Bay in Brooklyn were simply ''the creek,'' a fishing spot and informal local dump.

        <p>A year ago, the Gerritsen Creek salt marshes on Jamaica Bay in Brooklyn were simply ''the creek,'' a fishing spot and informal local dump. They were a place to toss old tires and rusting car hulks, or for teenagers to hide out for clandestine beer parties. Old-timers could do a bit of illegal muskrat hunting or crab netting there.</p>
        <p>Now, like a worn table stuck in the attic that turns out to be a valuable antique, the marshes are getting some respect. A new trail through Marine Park in Gerritsen Beach loops past the inlets and through the reeds to give visitors a chance to step inside the wetlands and walk around. From that vantage point, the soggy, swampy acres suddenly look impressive.</p>
        <p>The tall spartina, or cordgrasses, growing out of the little bay look soft and lush, in shades of green ranging from subtle to psychedelic brilliance. Herons and snowy egrets arc through the sky, which seems especially vast. It is so still you can hear the fiddler crabs, which burrow into the mud and are as plentiful as ants on an anthill, scuttling against the plastic sheet lining the gravel path.</p>
        <p>''The point of the trail,'' said Bella Pierson, a ranger at the city park, ''is to get people down to actually see it.''</p>
        <p>The point is to give people a nice park, of course -- a strolling and jogging trail, a retreat from noise and bustle, a place to relax and watch the grass wave and the fiddler crabs dig.</p>
        <p>But Marc A. Matsil, chief of the Natural Resources Group of the City Parks and Recreation Department, has another agenda for the new Marine Park nature trail and center. He wants to dispel the public images of swamps as bug-filled wastelands. He wants to give wetlands a fresh, glamorous image.</p>
        <p>The Natural Resources Group, founded by Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern in 1984, is in charge of acquiring, restoring and maintaining the city's natural lands -- its woodlands, meadows and wetlands. Like the sight of the World Trade Center towers beyond the cordgrass of Marine Park, the conjunction of New York City and wilderness may seem incongruous. But the Natural Resources Group is now responsible for about 30,000 acres of city-owned wildlands. Of that, 12,000 acres are parkland and 8,500 acres are salt wetlands.</p>
        <p>When it comes to protecting trees and meadows, the city rarely faces opposition. Yes, New Yorkers may have rolled their eyes when Mr. Stern described the criminal destruction of city trees as ''aboricide.'' Nevertheless, most residents shared his outrage. And the wide, grassy lawns in urban parks are universally treasured.</p>
        <p>Wetlands, though, have less cachet. Environmental organizations emphasize their importance. But in general, only wetlands in faraway spots -- rain forests in Brazil, for instance, or the Everglades in Florida -- arouse public passion. Local wetlands are thought of as soggy, reed-filled bogs.</p>
        <p>A walk through the salt marsh on the Marine Park trail could change that view. That, at least, is what Mr. Matsil and and his colleagues hope.</p>
        <p>To ecologists, salt marshes are gorgeous, fascinating and valuable. They inspire scientists like Mr. Matsil -- who sprinkles his conversation with terms like ''facultative mutualism'' and ''heterotrophic aerobic microbes,'' to lyricism.</p>
        <p>''They are the hidden jewels of the New York metro area,'' said Andrew S. Milliken, a biologist at the New England-New York Bight Coastal Program, which works to preserve the region's bays and harbors.</p>
        <p>Stanley Gorski, at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Research Center, startles colleagues with his enthusiasm. ''I tell them, 'You ought to see the salt marshes of New York City,' and they do a double take,'' he said. ''You wouldn't think of salt marshes in New York City, until you stop and say: 'Well, New York is a couple of islands.'</p>
        <p>''After they've seen salt marshes for what they are,'' Mr. Gorski added, ''some people regard them as a religious experience. Their appreciation is so profound.''</p>
        <p>After World War II, salt marshes were thought of as ''useless swampland,'' Mr. Matsil said. In a letter to Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri in 1950, Robert Moses, the enormously powerful parks commissioner, described filling thousands of acres of marsh with ''sand, ship ballast, rubble from bombed buildings in England, and Department of Sanitation garbage, refuse and ashes.'' Some 300,000 acres of tidal wetlands were filled in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts, Mr. Milliken said.</p>
        <p>But suspicion of wetlands in and around New York is longstanding.</p>
        <p>''The unrest about marshy areas goes back to colonial times,'' said Judith D. Zuk, president of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Their moist air was considered unhealthy and they were thought to harbor disease and dangerous insects, including mosquitoes. The draining and filling of marshland was viewed as a wise policy long before the Robert Moses era.</p>
        <p>But beginning in the 1960's, salt marshes finally got some respect. They soak up water overflows, reducing flood damage. They filter and break down pollutants, including oil spills and nitrogen, more effectively than any artificial device. The salt marsh system -- spartina grass, microbe-rich peat, and fiddler crabs, mussels and killifish, among other elements -- is rich with life. And salt marshes are self-renewing, flushed twice a day by the tides.</p>
        <p>By the 1970's, the drawbacks of the bulkheads then bounding most of New York City's waterfront were becoming apparent. New York's waterways were becoming seriously polluted and its huge fishing industry was threatened by declining numbers and varieties of fish. After the federal Clean Water Act was passed in 1972, New York State and City regulations followed, but over the objections of developers.</p>
        <p>The regulations were intended to protect the remaining salt and fresh wetlands in New York, and require compensation for all future destruction of them. They required that any construction in marshlands be approved by the state, and they prohibited any building that would injure wetlands areas larger than 12 acres. They required developers and polluters to pay for the restoration of each acre they damaged.</p>
        <p>Right now, with the widespread fear of the West Nile virus, wetlands are again being viewed by some as breeding grounds for virus-bearing mosquitoes. In fact, neither of the two types of mosquitoes known to carry the virus inhabit saltwater marshes, said Sandra Mullin, spokeswoman for the City Department of Health. While some kinds of mosquitoes live in salt marshes, the tidal flows tend to wash away larvae. Filled-in areas tend to have far higher concentrations of mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>The city has begun, or is about to begin, 17 different salt marsh restoration projects. At Marine Park, where only 30 of the 780 acres consist of natural salt marsh, $1.4 million in city and state money has been allocated for restoration. There is a 25-acre marsh restoration on the Arthur Kill, the waterway between western Staten Island and New Jersey, an area with the region's largest heron rookery. A $700,000 restoration of six acres of marshland at Alley Pond Park in Queens is nearly complete.</p>
        <p>Restoring lost salt marsh is expensive, costing $30 to $40 a cubic yard, Mr. Matsil said. It involves clearing the land of the ubiquitous reeds that thrive beyond the salt marshes and are considered invasive, pushing out other vegetation and greatly reducing the variety of wildlife. Then usually 10 to 15 feet of dirt, rubble and trash fill must be removed.</p>
        <p>Spartina seeds from Maryland did not thrive when first planted in Staten Island 10 years ago. So ecologists gathered grass seeds from healthy marshes within the city, correctly assuming the plants could withstand the stresses of New York life. The genetically adapted spartina has proved so strong that it can grow in oil-soaked mud and liquid asphalt. New York cordgrass, Mr. Matsil explained, ''is street tough.''</p>
        <p>The cycle that the city ecologists are trying to revive works like this: the spartina grass shoots oxygen down to its roots and into the peat mud, nourishing microorganisms that break down pollutants. The decaying grass provides food for mussels, snails and fiddler crabs, which burrow into the mud and further oxygenate it. The shellfish attract migrating birds, from snowy egrets to glossy ibises and herons; and the richer wildlife draws muskrats and diamondback terrapins.</p>
        <p>The restoration of the salt marsh cycle has helped to revive the worst shoreline in the city: the dozens of acres on the Arthur Kill crushed and blackened by 567,000 gallons of heating oil that spilled from an Exxon pipeline in 1990.</p>
        <p>However thorough the restoration, though, decades or even centuries are required before marshes return to their natural state, said Andrew Wilner, director of Baykeeper, a nonprofit harbor ecology group. Natural salt marshes, after all, developed over thousands of years. Ecologists in the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary Program, an alliance of government and private environmental organizations, are now pressing for a much higher ratio of compensation from companies that damage wetlands.</p>
        <p>Fines paid by Exxon and other corporate polluters are helping to pay for salt marsh restoration. The Natural Resources Group has acquired $70 million in penalties and government and private grants for use in restoring urban wildlands, including salt wetlands. ''For undoing the foibles and misdeeds of the past,'' Mr. Matsil said.</p>
        <p>Even small areas of restored salt marsh can make a noticeable difference in water quality, Mr. Matsil added. ''It's incumbent on us to chip away,'' he said. ''And chipping away matters.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 1, 2000, Friday  Two picture captions on Aug. 24 about a restored salt marsh in Brooklyn misstated the name of one bird found in the marsh and misidentified another bird. The first bird was a double-crested cormorant, not a crested cormorant. The other, shown in silhouette, was most likely a type of heron or egret, ornithological experts said, but they could not identify the species. It was not a glossy ibis.</p>
