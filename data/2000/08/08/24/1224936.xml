        <p>The National Transportation Safety Board approved its final report on the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 yesterday and issued four new safety recommendations to help prevent accidents.</p>
        <p>The unanimous vote of the five-member board after a two-day public meeting wrapped up the longest and most expensive investigation in the agency's 33-year history.</p>
        <p>Flight 800, involving a 25-year-old Boeing 747, was bound for Paris on July 17, 1996, when it broke apart in midair off Long Island minutes after taking off from Kennedy International Airport. All 230 people aboard were killed.</p>
        <p>Meeting in Washington, the board endorsed the findings of investigators that a mixture of fuel and air in the airplane's nearly empty center wing fuel tank blew up after being heated into an explosive state by the sun and air-conditioning packs attached to the outside of the tank. Though investigators never found what ignited the explosion, they said the source was most likely a short circuit that created a surge of electricity in a low-voltage wire attached to a fuel gauge inside the tank.</p>
        <p>Before voting on the report yesterday, board members reviewed the accounts of eyewitnesses, some of whom believe they saw a missile hit the jet and have accused the board of ignoring their reports.</p>
        <p>David L. Mayer, who led the board's examination of eyewitness accounts, said that most of the witnesses were too far away to see the initial explosion of the jet's center fuel tank. He said that those who saw a flash of light resembling a missile were really seeing the crippled jet as it broke apart and caught fire, taking  nearly a minute to crash.</p>
        <p>Accident investigators who have spent years searching for what sparked the explosion said the airlines and airplane manufacturers had not paid enough attention to the condition of electrical wiring on older aircraft like the one involved in the 1996 accident. James E. Hall, the safety board chairman, ordered a report by Nov. 15 to determine whether there is a correlation between aircraft age and the frequency of accidents.</p>
        <p>The four safety recommendations issued yesterday call for improved training of maintenance personnel about potentially unsafe wiring conditions in aircraft and for several actions to limit possible sources of ignition in fuel tanks.</p>
        <p>The board previously issued 11 other safety recommendations as a result of the Flight 800 investigation.</p>
