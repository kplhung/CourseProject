        <p>The Justice Department plans to post standards and specific expectations for an academic review of the Carnivore surveillance system on its Web site (www.usdoj.gov) this afternoon, Attorney General Janet Reno said. The program, used by the F.B.I., can intercept and search private e-mail for specific words and phrases, allowing agents to quickly sift through large numbers of messages. The department is seeking a major university to review the government e-mail surveillance program that supporters call an asset to law enforcement and detractors see as a serious threat to privacy. A final decision on a university is expected by Sept. 15, Ms. Reno said, with the technical review to be completed by Dec. 1. The results will be considered before the department determines how Carnivore will be used in the future.</p>
