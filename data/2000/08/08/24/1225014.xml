        <p>MANHATTAN: RAT TESTING URGED  Warning of the risk of rat-borne diseases, members of the City Council yesterday called on the Department of Health to test rat carcasses. They cited reports this month that a dog had died of leptospirosis, an infection that rats can transmit, after eating a dead rat in Prospect Park. ''Just as we test dead birds for West Nile virus, we need a similar strategy for rats,'' said Victor Robles, chairman of the Council's Health Committee.</p>

        <p>THE BRONX: MONEY FOR TEACHERS  The Bronx will receive $17.2 million to hire 164 new teachers and reduce class sizes this fall, United States Representative Jose E. Serrano announced yesterday. The money is part of a $1.3 billion initiative by the federal Department of Education that aims to reduce class sizes by hiring 29,062 new teachers nationwide over seven years. Local school districts can use the money for hiring teachers in grades one through three, and for teacher testing and training.</p>

        <p>ROCHESTER: CANAL FLOTILLA PLANNED  A world conference on canals will begin here on Sept. 10 with a flotilla of 100 boats down the Erie Canal, organizers said. The parade will include antique tour boats, tugboats and houseboats. It is being held to call attention to the 175th anniversary of the canal. The six-day World Conference on Canals will include seminars on its importance to the economy of the region, said Cheryl Marshall, an organizer of the event.</p>

        <p>GARRISON: FRIARS REACH SETTLEMENT  After 15 years of negotiations, the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement and the National Park Service have settled a dispute over a stretch of the Appalachian Trail that runs through the friars' 400-acre property, Graymoor. Details were not released, but officials said the deal would increase the buffer around what is officially called the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. The deal also allows the friars to improve facilities within the trail easement at Graymoor, where friars have tended to homeless and alcoholic men since 1898.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: FORMER BOOKKEEPER SUED  A Manhattan magazine publishing company has filed a civil lawsuit in the Philippines to recover $10 million allegedly stolen by the firm's former head bookkeeper, prosecutors said yesterday. Manhattan prosecutors have charged the bookkeeper, Fidela Caparas, a 54-year-old Philippine immigrant now in jail in New York awaiting trial, with transferring the stolen money to a bank in her native country. The lawsuit, first reported in The Filipino Reporter, was filed in Tagaytay City in the Philippines.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: INFECTED MOSQUITOES FOUND  The State Health Department said it had confirmed the first case of mosquitoes infected with West Nile virus in New Jersey. The mosquitoes were found in pools in Westwood and River Edge, both in Bergen County. Officials said 165 birds in nine counties in northern and central New Jersey had tested positive for the virus; but mosquitoes pose a far greater threat to humans. No humans in New Jersey have tested positive.</p>

        <p>CAMDEN: OFFICER ARRESTED  A Camden police patrolman was arrested yesterday after identifying an undercover officer to a known drug dealer, the Camden County prosecutor said. The officer, Patrolman David T. Dupree, 26, was charged with official misconduct, which can carry a 10-year sentence, before being released on $50,000 bail, said the prosecutor, Lee A. Solomon. Mr. Solomon called the actions the patrolman is accused of ''most disturbing,'' and said they compromised an investigation in a city plagued by drugs and endangered a fellow officer's life.</p>

        <p>MILFORD: SCULPTURE COMPLAINTS  Officials of the American Red Cross chapter have removed a sculpture from the agency's front lawn, after critics complained that the artwork was obscene and frightening to children. The agency's director, Joan Heybruck, also said the sculpture posed a safety hazard by distracting drivers. The piece is part of a community arts project involving 22 sculptures of submarines across Milford, home of Simon Lake, a pioneer of submarine design. The sculpture, called ''A Cry for Help,'' depicted a half-naked woman with an expression of agony atop a submarine. The artist, Paul Perrotti, called the criticism ''narrow-minded.''</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: COLLAPSE INJURES 4  Four construction workers were hospitalized after a construction crane being used to repair a chimney at Hartford Hospital collapsed twice yesterday. Two of the workers were left dangling by their safety harnesses more than 80 feet in the air when the top of the 120-foot crane collapsed at 10 a.m. Three hours later, the crane broke again while workers were removing it, injuring two other workers. The four were in stable condition after being treated for head injuries and scrapes and bruises.</p>
