        <p>The Senate Commerce Committee is planning to hold hearings on the Firestone tires that were the subject of a safety recall, a Congressional aide said today.</p>
        <p>The committee, which oversees regulation of interstate commerce and highway safety, will convene hearings next month to examine the recent problems that caused Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. to recall around 6.5 million tires, the staff member said. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the committee, requested the hearings, the aide said.</p>
        <p>The safety problems have continued through the recall. Two more deaths were attributed to the faulty tires after an accident on Aug. 16 in Wyoming. Garry Lynn Meek, 56, of Farmersville, Calif., and his granddaughter, Amy Lynn Meek, 13, were killed when the left rear tire tread peeled off, causing their Ford Explorer to skid and roll over. The tire was a Firestone ATX 75R15, one of the brands that were recalled.</p>
        <p>Government data has indicated that virtually all the recent deaths linked to Firestone tires now being recalled occurred when sport utility vehicles, most of them Ford Explorers, rolled over after the tires failed.</p>
        <p>The committee will invite a number of representatives, possibly including federal transportation safety officials; Jacques A. Nassar, the president of the Ford Motor Company; and American executives of Firestone, although no invitations have been sent, the aide said.</p>
        <p>About two-thirds of the tires being recalled were put on S.U.V.'s and trucks made by Ford over the last decade.</p>
        <p>This month Firestone acknowledged that millions of tires made since 1991 were unusually prone to tread peeling, and it now faces 50 lawsuits and a federal investigation into accusations that 46 deaths and 80 injuries are linked to the tires.</p>
