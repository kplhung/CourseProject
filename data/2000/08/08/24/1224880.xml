        <p>Owners of the Apple PowerBook 5300 and 190 models can trade in their old computers for a significant discount on one of the company's 400-megahertz G3 laptops if they act quickly. From now until Aug. 31, Apple is offering $700 off the price of a new G3 PowerBook (usually $2,499) for those who choose to send their old 5300 or 190 models back to the company. The 5300/190 series, which was released in 1995, gained a measure of infamy because of a host of design and technical problems, and its overheating -- and occasionally combusting -- battery.  Those interested in taking advantage of the offer should call Apple at (800) 767-2775. Although not so dramatic as bursting into flames, the discount seems a much safer way for the 5300/190 series to go out in a blaze of glory.</p>
