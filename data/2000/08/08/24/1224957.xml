        <p>The incidence of diabetes increased markedly in the United States from 1990 to 1998, including a 76 percent rise in cases among people in their 30's, researchers are reporting today, and they warn that the disease will take a harsh toll in disability, death and medical expenses in decades to come.</p>
        <p>Doctors attribute much of the rise to obesity, which is also increasing steadily, with more than half of Americans now overweight.

        <p>The incidence of diabetes increased markedly in the United States from 1990 to 1998, including a 76 percent rise in cases among people in their 30's, researchers are reporting today, and they warn that the disease will take a harsh toll in disability, death and medical expenses in decades to come.</p>
        <p>Doctors attribute much of the rise to obesity, which is also increasing steadily, with more than half of Americans now overweight. Most of the patients have Type 2 diabetes, commonly called adult onset diabetes, which accounts for 90 percent to 95 percent of the cases of the disease and can be brought on by inactivity and weight gain. Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for most of the remaining 5 percent to 10 percent of cases, is caused by a malfunction of the immune system and is not linked to obesity.</p>
        <p>Researchers predict that Type 2 diabetes will continue to snowball, because there is a delay between the development of obesity and the onset of diabetes, which means that for many overweight people it is just a matter of time before the disease sets in.</p>
        <p>''We're having enough trouble taking care of people with diabetes today,'' said Dr. Frank Vinicor, director of the diabetes division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and an author of the study, which is being published today in the journal Diabetes Care. ''It's going to get considerably worse in the future.''</p>
        <p>Experts attribute the rising weight to Americans' increasing tendency to park themselves in front of television and computer screens, exercising too little and eating too much, particularly large portions of high-calorie foods. The study showed that the risk of diabetes increased by 4 percent for every pound of excess weight.</p>
        <p>Over all, the prevalence of diabetes rose to 6.5 percent in 1998 from 4.9 percent of the population in 1990, an increase of 33 percent, according to the study. Hispanics had a 38 percent increase in diabetes cases, compared with increases of 29 percent in whites and 26 percent in blacks. In total, the percentages translate into 13 million cases of diabetes.</p>
        <p>During the same period, the proportion of people who were overweight rose to 54 percent from 44 percent.</p>
        <p>Other studies have estimated that in addition to the diagnosed cases, more than five million additional Americans, have diabetes without knowing it, because the disease produces few or no symptoms in its early stages.</p>
        <p>Severe complications make diabetes a substantial public health problem. It is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure and leg amputations, and it greatly increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, the leading causes of death in the United States.</p>
        <p>The increases in people in their 30's and younger are particularly worrisome, researchers say. The longer a person has the disease, the greater the odds of complications. In the past, Type 2 diabetes was seen mainly in people over 45. Today, doctors say they are alarmed to find the disease even in teenagers, as more and more of them become obese. The sharpest rise in the disease was among people in their 30's, increasing to 3.7 percent from 2.1 percent in 1990.</p>
        <p>The cost of diabetes is estimated at $98 billion a year.</p>
        <p>''Expensive as we think health care is today, with these chronic conditions coming on it's going to be very threatening to quality of life as well as cost issues,'' Dr. Vinicor said. ''If we saw a 33 percent increase in infectious diseases like tuberculosis or AIDS, I believe there would be an understandable demand for action. We can't just view inactivity and overweight as purely a kind of cosmetic thing. It's got to be viewed as a serious public health issue.''</p>
        <p>Many measures are needed to fight the trend, Dr. Vinicor said, offering several examples: ''We need to insure that people are informed about healthy choices of foods, that when you build new homes there are sidewalks where people can walk and be active, that schools reinstate physical education and that cafeterias at schools offer healthy foods.''</p>
        <p>He said research had shown that school-based programs to encourage exercise could help prevent obesity.</p>
        <p>Diabetes has been on the rise for several decades, but Dr. Vinicor said the current rate of increase is slightly greater than in the past. He said he thought the new study reflected a real rise in the incidence of the disease, and not just increased diagnosis due to better screening.</p>
        <p>If anything, he said, the figures are conservative, because they were gathered by a telephone survey and therefore did not include people too poor to have telephones, who are among those with the highest rates of obesity and diabetes.</p>
        <p>The figures being reported today come from an annual telephone survey of 150,000 households in which people were asked their height and weight and whether they had been told by a doctor that they had diabetes.</p>
        <p>Not all overweight people become diabetic; the majority do not. But the risk of the disease increases with the degree of obesity. The main abnormality in diabetes is an excessively high level of blood sugar, or glucose. Type 2 diabetes is most likely to develop in people with a condition known as insulin resistance, in which the body cannot make proper use of the insulin, the hormone that normally helps glucose enter cells so that it can be used as fuel.</p>
        <p>Insulin resistance is often associated with obesity but researchers are not sure whether obesity causes insulin resistance, or vice versa. Many scientists think that the tendency to become insulin resistant is genetic. In any case, the body tries to overcome insulin resistance by producing higher and higher levels of the hormone, which is made in the pancreas.</p>
        <p>In some people with insulin resistance, most of them obese, the insulin-producing cells simply wear out, leading to a shortage of insulin and high blood sugar, the hallmarks of diabetes.</p>
        <p>Researchers think excess glucose causes trouble in part by thickening the blood, which impedes circulation, and by binding to needed enzymes and other important proteins and sabotaging their function.</p>
        <p>Exercise and weight loss can lower insulin resistance and high blood sugar and are commonly the first measures recommended to treat Type 2 diabetes. Each can help, but the combination is more effective than either one alone. They are also being studied to determine whether they can ward off the disease in people at high risk.</p>
        <p>But few people are able to stick to diets or exercise programs, and those who do lose weight often regain it. Many people with Type 2 diabetes eventually need pills or insulin shots to lower their blood sugar.</p>
        <p>Studies have shown that ''tight control'' of blood sugar, keeping it as close to normal as possible, can forestall the devastating complications of diabetes. But surveys reveal that few patients achieve that degree of control.</p>
