        <p>Since 1842, a shop called Busatti Telerie, in Citta di Castello, has carried the finest handmade cotton and linen for tableware, bed linens and upholstery. Many of the patterned designs are the same as were used in Roman and medieval times and are still called by the names of the families they were commissioned for. More than a yard of thick striped linen with decorative borders ranges from $7.50 to $10.30; Busatti Telerie, Via del Popolo, Citta di Castello.</p>
