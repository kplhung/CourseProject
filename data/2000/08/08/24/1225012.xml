        <p>The British food retailer J. Sainsbury P.L.C. said it was considering selling its Homebase home improvement chain, to focus on its supermarkets. Analysts said the division could be worth more than $1 billion and noted that a sale would help Sainsbury's recovery. The company, once Britain's top-performing supermarket chain, lost its leading position to Tesco in terms of sales and profits in 1995. The chief executive, Sir Peter Davis, took the helm in March and is charged with reversing the profit decline. Sainsbury, along with other British supermarket retailers, has faced price wars that have resulted from Wal-Mart's purchase of the ASDA Group last year.</p>
