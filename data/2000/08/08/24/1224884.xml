        <p>By the River  On a rolling meadow overlooking the Hudson River at Sunnyside, Washington Irving's estate in Tarrytown, jazz will fill the Westchester air on Saturday and Sunday. With headliners like Hugh Masekela and the Sonny Fortune Quartet and a program including bebop, Brazilian, Latin and modern, the Fifth Annual Sunnyside Jazz Festival, presented by Jazz Forum Arts and Historic Hudson Valley, runs from noon to 7:30 p.m. each day. Besides the Sonny Fortune Quartet, Saturday's attractions include Kenny Barron's Brazilian Jazz Project and the contemporary jazz guitarist Gil Parris. Besides Mr. Masekela, the Sunday talent includes the drummer Chico Hamilton and Euphoria, as well as the Jimmy Heath Quartet.</p>
        <p>Rarities  Because overexposure to light can discolor paper and cause images to fade, museums tend to keep drawings in storage and limit their exhibition time. But in a new show starting on Sunday, the Cleveland Museum of Art will be displaying the highlights of its collection of 2,700 European and American drawings for the first time. Consisting of 120 works, ''Master Drawings from the Cleveland Museum of Art,'' including creations by Raphael, Durer, Ingres, Degas, Goya, Turner, Copley, Homer, Cassatt, Picasso and Matisse, will continue through Oct. 15. The show includes a nude male by Michelangelo, a study for the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, one of the few works by him in the United States. The show is to travel next year to the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, running from Feb. 2 to April 27; the Morgan Library in Manhattan, May 23 to Aug. 19; and the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston in the fall.</p>

        <p>Mozart Bows Out  As the days of summer dwindle to a precious few before its unofficial end on Labor Day, some of the attractions that distinguish the season in New York are winding up. The 34th year of Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival, concluding 32 concerts in 4 weeks at 3 sites, is going out in grand style. Its final celebration consists of not one but two performances, at 8 p.m. tomorrow and Saturday in Avery Fisher Hall, of Mozart's Mass in C minor. The performances, with Gerard Schwarz conducting the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra, feature the soprano Harolyn Blackwell, the mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson, the tenor Anthony Dean Griffey, the bass Peter Rose and the Riverside Choral Society.</p>
