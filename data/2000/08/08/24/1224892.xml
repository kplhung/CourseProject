        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>An Aug. 21 letter discusses the needless loss of a potential source of energy through the export of New York's garbage to out-of-state landfills. But much of this energy would be available if the food-waste portion of the trash -- about 15 percent of the city's solid waste -- were ground by residents with in-sink food-waste disposers, which have recently been made legal in the city.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>An Aug. 21 letter discusses the needless loss of a potential source of energy through the export of New York's garbage to out-of-state landfills. But much of this energy would be available if the food-waste portion of the trash -- about 15 percent of the city's solid waste -- were ground by residents with in-sink food-waste disposers, which have recently been made legal in the city.</p>
        <p>The infrastructure is already in place in the city's water-pollution control network, which not only conveys ground garbage efficiently and noiselessly to 14 waste-water treatment plants but also converts most of the resulting sludge to methane gas, which is used as fuel to reduce the cost of plant operation.</p>
        <p>Why pay for gasification plants and additional transportation when we can already take advantage of our modern water pollution control network?</p>
        <p>WILLIAM B. PRESSMAN  Jamaica, Queens, Aug. 21, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer was director of research and development, New York City Environmental Protection Department.</p>
