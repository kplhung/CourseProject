        <p>General Manager Scott Layden continued to work the phones yesterday as the Knicks sought to put together a deal that would bring Glen Rice to New York and end Patrick Ewing's increasingly ugly relationship with the franchise, its fans and the news media.</p>
        <p>The parties in Seattle -- from Sonics management to Vin Baker to his agent, Aaron Goodwin -- are frustrated because they believe the deal would have been consummated on Monday were it not leaked to the news media last weekend.</p>
        <p>The Knicks are frustrated because the fans' and news media's rush to all but escort Ewing out of town will make it difficult and uncomfortable if they are forced to welcome him back into the fold, something that is growing more likely.</p>
        <p>The Knicks, the Sonics and the Los Angeles Lakers scrambled yesterday to resuscitate the four-team, 13-player trade that fell apart Monday evening when the Detroit Pistons pulled out amid criticism from their fans.</p>
        <p>The three clubs tried to sweeten the deal for the Pistons, who originally were to receive seven marginal players, but Detroit was not moved.</p>
        <p>Pistons General Manager Joe Dumars told the Detroit news media yesterday that he would be open to working with the three teams if a better deal were made available, but that was unlikely.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the Pistons asked the Knicks to include Marcus Camby in the package, but New York declined. Instead, Detroit is set to send Christian Laettner to Dallas next week for Cedric Ceballos.</p>
        <p>With Detroit all but out of the picture, the clubs pressed for either the Chicago Bulls or the Charlotte Hornets to get involved.</p>
        <p>The Knicks, Sonics and Lakers all have interest in the Bulls' center and power forward Dickey Simpkins and may have been looking at involving him in the deal with a sign-and-trade agreement.</p>
        <p>The Knicks and Sonics could work a two-team deal that featured Ewing and Baker as the principals, but New York is less than enthralled with Baker.</p>
        <p>Even at 38, Ewing is more productive than Seattle's declining power forward, and the six years and $77 million remaining on Baker's contract conjure up thoughts of the restrictive 12-year, $84 million contract that Larry Johnson lugged to New York four years ago.</p>
        <p>''If the two teams want to get a deal done, they don't need three or four teams,'' said Goodwin, who hoped that Baker would become a Knick today before leaving for Hawaii to train for the Olympics. ''If New York wants Vin and if Seattle wants Patrick Ewing, then do a deal.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks would take Baker if they also landed Rice in the deal, but they are hesitant to make such a move otherwise. The clubs continue to talk, though.</p>
        <p>Another possible two-team deal involves the Knicks and the Lakers. The clubs are believed to have discussed a trade that would have brought Rice, the backup center Travis Knight and the reserve guards John Celestand and Tyronn Lue to New York in exchange for Chris Dudley, Chris Childs and another player, possibly the rookie Lavor Postell.</p>
        <p>The Lakers, however, balked at accepting Childs, who got into a fight with Kobe Bryant in a game last season, and asked the Knicks to replace him with a more enticing player, possibly Camby. That forced the Knicks to step back.</p>
        <p>The Knicks' interest in Rice is real, which implies that the deal they are attempting to make may be a prelude to another trade involving Allan Houston.</p>
        <p>The Knicks are aware that they need a top-flight big man to compete for a championship, and adding Rice would give them the flexibility to package Houston and perhaps Camby in such a deal. The obvious desirables would be Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo and Sacramento's Chris Webber, both of whom will be free agents after next season and could pressure their teams to trade them.</p>
        <p>While the clubs work the phones, the possibility of Ewing remaining with the Knicks increases.</p>
        <p>Seattle is perhaps the only team with which the Knicks can work a deal that involves their onetime franchise player, and the delay is making the Sonics bitter. They stand to gain not only Ewing but Maurice Taylor, who would sign with Seattle for the $2.25 million midlevel exception if Ewing joins the Sonics.</p>
        <p>Moreover, if the Sonics did not extend Ewing's contract after next season, which is likely, they could position themselves to be nearly $20 million beneath the salary cap next summer, when Webber, Mutombo and the Dallas Mavericks small forward Michael Finley become free agents.</p>
        <p>The Sonics want desperately to part ways with Baker, who has played poorly his last two seasons, and Goodwin has even gone on record as saying that there is too much acrimony between the parties for Baker to return to Seattle. Baker, who does not get along with Sonics Coach Paul Westphal, is looking to play superbly at the Sydney Olympics in hopes of enhancing his trade value.</p>
        <p>As unpleasant as things have become for Ewing in New York, his situation is not as bad as Baker's and a reconciliation by next season is not unfathomable. The Knicks will not trade Ewing for substandard player, and they know that his 15 points and 10 rebounds a night are still of major value.</p>
        <p>Houston, who seems to let trade talk involving his name bounce off his back, said he could see Ewing back in the starting lineup despite the recent turmoil.</p>
        <p>''It's not like we haven't been through this before -- trade rumors and speculation,'' Houston said. ''If and when he comes back we're going to still make it work and everybody has to be on the same page. Just because something happens one day in the office does not mean you come back for the rest of the week and complain about it.''</p>
