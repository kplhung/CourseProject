        <p>Amazon.com, one of the world's largest online retailers, announced today that it would begin offering a car-selling service on the Internet, the latest and potentially most serious in a series of challenges to automakers' ability to control the distribution of automobiles.</p>
        <p>Beginning early Thursday morning, Amazon shoppers will be able to compare features for hundreds of models from various brands. They will be able to configure a chosen car or light truck with various options and then obtain a price quote and estimated delivery date for their vehicle. But while buyers will be able to put down a deposit on their chosen vehicle through Amazon, using their credit cards, customers will buy the vehicle itself from a local dealer, either at a dealership or by having dealership employees deliver it to their door.</p>

        <p>Amazon.com, one of the world's largest online retailers, announced today that it would begin offering a car-selling service on the Internet, the latest and potentially most serious in a series of challenges to automakers' ability to control the distribution of automobiles.</p>
        <p>Beginning early Thursday morning, Amazon shoppers will be able to compare features for hundreds of models from various brands. They will be able to configure a chosen car or light truck with various options and then obtain a price quote and estimated delivery date for their vehicle. But while buyers will be able to put down a deposit on their chosen vehicle through Amazon, using their credit cards, customers will buy the vehicle itself from a local dealer, either at a dealership or by having dealership employees deliver it to their door.</p>
        <p>Amazon will market automobiles through an alliance with Greenlight .com, a privately held online company owned by several big chains of auto dealerships and by various venture capitalists. In January, Amazon announced that it had bought a 5 percent stake in Greenlight.</p>
        <p>By requiring customers to buy vehicles from dealers at the end of the process, Amazon and Greenlight hope to circumvent restrictive state laws that have entangled companies that have sought to buy cars from dealers and actually resell them to consumers. Greenlight has affiliated dealers in 27 metropolitan areas who will provide the cars for the venture with Amazon.</p>
        <p>Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, and Joel Manby, the chief executive of Greenlight, said in an interview here this morning that their companies had carefully designed their plan to comply with all state laws. Tweaking the auto industry, they announced their plan today at the Automotive Hall of Fame, less than a mile from the Ford Motor Company's headquarters in this southwestern suburb of Detroit.</p>
        <p>Amazon's shares rose $2.31 each, to $38.81.</p>
        <p>Consumers using another online car buying service, CarsDirect.com, pay all of the vehicle's price directly to the service, which then passes the money on, after subtracting a small profit margin, to a dealer, who delivers the car and its title directly to the buyer. Because the company acts as a principal in the transactions, it drew criticism from regulators in some states and it recently decided not to do business in Texas and 10 states with small populations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manby said that Greenlight, by not acting as a principal in a transaction, would be able to do business nationwide, including in Texas. He declined to say how much of the deposit that customers pay Amazon would be forwarded to the dealers supplying the cars.</p>
        <p>Carol Kent, the enforcement director in the Motor Vehicle Division of the Texas Transportation Department, said that her agency was allowing Greenlight to do business there.</p>
        <p>But Ford quickly criticized the program, saying it did not allow dealers to play a large enough role in selling the vehicles. Stephen Lyons, Ford's general sales manager, said  the new arrangement essentially amounted to brokering cars that are purchased from dealers -- an activity that is prohibited by laws in some states.</p>
        <p>''Their model isn't satisfactory to us in terms of how they satisfy customers and bring dealers in,'' Mr. Lyons said. ''We view them, as others, as electronic brokers, because what they do is offer our vehicles.''</p>
        <p>General Motors announced plans a week ago to set up its own site that would provide information on all brands of automobiles, including those of rival automakers, but would refer customers to dealers for actual sales. Terry Sullivan, a G.M. spokesman, said that the automaker did not comment on other companies' Internet ventures, but believed in general that dealers should handle sales.</p>
        <p>Automakers say they want dealers to sell their cars because only dealers have the experience and knowledge needed to teach customers about a new vehicle and then provide warranty repairs and other service during subsequent years. The automakers have taken this position partly because of pressure from dealers with multiple franchises. These dealers have warned that they may be less energetic in selling models made by those automakers that do not fight back against online sales.</p>
        <p>Automakers have the legal ability to create problems for Amazon and Greenlight. Ford and G.M. have announced plans not to send dealers new cars to replace cars that they sell through services that the automakers view as brokers. Foreign automakers have said that they want to sell cars mainly through dealers, although they have not made specific threats to withhold new vehicles from dealers that work with brokers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lyons said that one of the dealership chains involved with Amazon and Greenlight, Sonic Automotive, had already agreed not to sell Ford vehicles through the service. Ford is also in negotiations with a chain of 125 dealerships, Asbury Automotive, which helped found Greenlight, he said.</p>
        <p>Online retailing of automobiles was dominated until recently by former car dealers who set up specialty sites, like Peter Ellis, who created Autobytel.com, the leading online auto retailer in the late 1990's. But such sites have been struggling recently as they face competition from bigger, more established companies.</p>
        <p>America Online recently allied itself with the nation's largest dealership chain, AutoNation, which is controlled by Wayne Huizenga, the Florida investor best known for having built Waste Management, the garbage disposal company, and Blockbuster, the video rental chain.</p>
        <p>Under a plan similar to Amazon's, America Online will put an auto retailing link on its home page late next month that will allow users to select cars from 300 AutoNation sites around the country and another 900 dealerships that use AutoNation's online buying program, AutoVantage. AutoNation sold $1 billion worth of vehicles last year to people who initially communicated with the company through its Internet sites.</p>
        <p>Michael Jackson, AutoNation's chief executive, said in a telephone interview today that he did not regard Amazon and Greenlight as a serious threat. He contended that it was impossible to make money without having a single company that owns both the dealerships and the Internet referral service. Automakers have not objected to AutoNation's arrangement because dealers play a larger role in the transactions.</p>
        <p>Amazon has been struggling with huge losses that have been draining its cash. Mr. Bezos said that Greenlight would pay $15.3 million to Amazon over two years as part of the arrangement. This is much less than the $82 million over five years that Greenlight had proposed to pay last January when financial markets made it easier for Internet companies to raise money.</p>
        <p>While Amazon will audit Greenlight's customer satisfaction, Greenlight will handle most auto retailing on Amazon's site. Amazon had previously provided a link to Greenlight.</p>
