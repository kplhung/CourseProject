      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, has some provocative if premature ideas about cross-border immigration. His ultimate goal is free movement of labor across an open border. But that is not practical anytime soon. With the more than tenfold gap between United States and Mexican wages, the migration would be all one way, as low-wage Mexican workers competed with the poorest, least skilled Americans. So for now, Mr. Fox would like to see Washington significantly increase the number of temporary visas available to Mexican workers. In exchange, Mexico would strengthen policies to discourage illegal emigration to the United States. That is an experiment worth discussing.</p>
        <p>America's current border enforcement policies are not working well. The nearly $1 billion a year Washington spends to police its southern border has not measurably reduced the flow of illegal immigrants from Mexico. Around 340,000 Mexicans enter the United States every year, well over half of them illegally. Traditionally, illegal immigration has provided a safety valve for Mexican governments and low-wage labor for American employers. But it has also been a source of diplomatic tension, particularly when would-be immigrants are killed by border agents or unscrupulous smugglers or die from the effects of heat and dehydration.</p>

        <p>Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, has some provocative if premature ideas about cross-border immigration. His ultimate goal is free movement of labor across an open border. But that is not practical anytime soon. With the more than tenfold gap between United States and Mexican wages, the migration would be all one way, as low-wage Mexican workers competed with the poorest, least skilled Americans. So for now, Mr. Fox would like to see Washington significantly increase the number of temporary visas available to Mexican workers. In exchange, Mexico would strengthen policies to discourage illegal emigration to the United States. That is an experiment worth discussing.</p>
        <p>America's current border enforcement policies are not working well. The nearly $1 billion a year Washington spends to police its southern border has not measurably reduced the flow of illegal immigrants from Mexico. Around 340,000 Mexicans enter the United States every year, well over half of them illegally. Traditionally, illegal immigration has provided a safety valve for Mexican governments and low-wage labor for American employers. But it has also been a source of diplomatic tension, particularly when would-be immigrants are killed by border agents or unscrupulous smugglers or die from the effects of heat and dehydration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox proceeds from the realistic assumption that the number of Mexicans entering the United States each year, either legally or illegally, will not fall below 340,000. But he would like to see a significantly larger proportion of that total given legal status, through the issuance of tens of thousands of additional work visas annually. He would also like legal status granted to many Mexicans who entered the United States illegally in the past.</p>
        <p>In return, Mexico could crack down on Central Americans who cross its territory to enter the United States illegally, and enforce racketeering laws against smuggling syndicates. Any increases in the number of American visas should be linked to evidence of improved Mexican border enforcement.</p>
        <p>Some Americans fear that adding temporary visas for Mexicans will drive down wages of low-income Americans, and that any amnesty for those here illegally will only invite future illegal crossings. But the border is already highly porous. Some experts believe that a well-conceived program along the lines Mr. Fox suggests could produce a long-term drop in illegal crossings. Legalized immigrants also have greater ability to unionize and demand decent conditions, making them less likely to undermine the status of low-wage Americans.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush will both meet the new Mexican leader during his current visit to the United States. Both candidates should use the opportunity to learn more about his immigration ideas.</p>
