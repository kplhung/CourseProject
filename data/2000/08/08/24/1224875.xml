        <p>The young members of the rock band At the Drive-In look as if they want to be transparently earnest. At the Knitting Factory on Monday, its singer, Cedric Bixler, underfed and lanky, sang in a high and reedy voice, the sound of the new postmacho rock star. He flailed and jumped and vaulted off anything he could find onstage. There's no let-up in this band's music. The performers are constantly at the threshold where planned song form turns into a blur of hyperventilating mania.</p>
        <p>The band, which formed in the mid-90's in El Paso, has slowly risen through shoestring-budget independent-music culture and started to pop up on big bills over the last year. If you don't read the kind of cheap-newsprint music magazines whose ink sticks on your hands, you may have missed the band's underground moment. It's possible that the band's next record, to be released in September by Grand Royal, will lift it out of small clubs entirely.</p>

        <p>The young members of the rock band At the Drive-In look as if they want to be transparently earnest. At the Knitting Factory on Monday, its singer, Cedric Bixler, underfed and lanky, sang in a high and reedy voice, the sound of the new postmacho rock star. He flailed and jumped and vaulted off anything he could find onstage. There's no let-up in this band's music. The performers are constantly at the threshold where planned song form turns into a blur of hyperventilating mania.</p>
        <p>The band, which formed in the mid-90's in El Paso, has slowly risen through shoestring-budget independent-music culture and started to pop up on big bills over the last year. If you don't read the kind of cheap-newsprint music magazines whose ink sticks on your hands, you may have missed the band's underground moment. It's possible that the band's next record, to be released in September by Grand Royal, will lift it out of small clubs entirely.</p>
        <p>If one of punk's innovations was outright suspicion of the music business, emo -- the earnest, emotional, post-macho subcategory that this band is often associated with -- has taken that sense of purity and mission one step further. At the Drive-In made an unexpected step by pumping up its sound for its next album.  The band worked with Ross Robinson, a producer who has shaped the sound of the overnight rap-metal successes Korn and Slipknot, bands whose work is exquisitely calculated to shock and offend. It was a good move: their new songs, traveling from stretches of quiet, slightly experimental rumination to loud thrashing -- very much like Fugazi -- have a great booming power, as good as three-minute blood rushes get.</p>
        <p>Rhythmically, the band's sound is clipped and military; every once in a while the music broke into reggae, but unlike most of rock's major new hopes, there's very little funk in it. And ''wormed our way through distant earth'' -- the refrain of ''Pattern Against User,'' one of its best songs -- is not a slogan.</p>
        <p>The band's lyrics seem to be about inequities, but they are basically impenetrable. (Like the old band Wire, this band plays with bulletinlike pseudo-official song titles for their songs: ''Invalid Litter Dept.,'' ''Non-Zero Possibility.'')</p>
        <p>Honesty is valuable, but there's no way to make rock without artifice, and with pluming Afros and a flag draped over one of the guitar amplifiers, the band's appearance strikes shrewd echoes of the MC5. Mr. Bixler ran through a catalog of I'm-on-the-edge poses: glaring eyes, microphone cord wrapped around his neck like a noose. And the truth is that the songs themselves are -- with a few exceptions -- not interesting enough.</p>
        <p>Monday night's show seemed like a 45-minute spasmodic non sequitur: the effect was studied revolutionary zeal, but it was completely unclear what this band was revolting against.  Ultimately, the power of this band is all in its innocence; it's going to be interesting to see what it, and its audience, become when they grow up.</p>
