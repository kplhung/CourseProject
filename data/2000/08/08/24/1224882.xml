        <p>Lincoln Center, which did much excellent work for Bach in the early part of this year, the 250th anniversary of the composer's death, has managed to continue it in recent weeks with a welcome bit of subterfuge, turning much of the increasingly unpredictable Mostly Mozart Festival into a ''Bach Celebration.'' And the centerpiece was a major event, the American debut of the full Collegium Vocale of Ghent, period-instrument band as well as chorus, directed in two concerts by Philippe Herreweghe, ending with Bach's B minor Mass at Avery Fisher Hall on Monday evening.</p>
        <p>Mr. Herreweghe and the Ghent group have been long and widely acclaimed, although most Americans know their work only from recordings, including a B minor Mass from 1996, now a part of Harmonia Mundi France's extensive Bach Edition. Those recordings have seldom been dull, and some of the reasons were apparent here.</p>
        <p>Although his forces were superbly drilled, Mr. Herreweghe seemed to encourage enterprise and individuality. In the ''Crucifixus,'' for example, the two cellists appeared to invent the ground bass afresh with pointed articulation and natural phrasing, and such little emphases abounded.</p>
        <p>And when individualism was less feasible, in choral parts for example, Mr. Herreweghe simulated it, drawing a little swell from the sopranos here, from the tenors there. All of it served to enliven the performance with the constant surprise of spontaneity, whether real or feigned.</p>
        <p>There were bigger surprises, too. Tenors are often the weak part of a chorus, but here they may have been the strongest. If anything, the basses underproduced at times, as in the lovely swinging bass line of the Sanctus, but those wonderful cellists (who ever noticed the cellists in a B minor Mass?) came to their aid. In the ''Et resurrexit,'' Mr. Herreweghe took no chances, giving a difficult exposed line for basses to the bass soloist, Sebastian Noack. (A trick at least as old as that 1996 recording, it nods, perhaps, toward current theories that Bach himself may often have settled for one voice per part in choruses.)</p>
        <p>Despite such discrepancies, the choral lines were exquisitely balanced at cadences, and they blended well. The same cannot be said for the vocal soloists, two of whom, Mr. Noack and Scot Weir, the tenor, were filling in for ailing colleagues.</p>
        <p>Here, in another surprise, the strongest voice -- indeed, the only one adequate to the large hall -- was that of the countertenor, Andreas Scholl. With a clarion Italianate sound, complete with secure vibrato, Mr. Scholl overshadowed the others, especially in duet with the soprano, Deborah York. Nor did it help that Mr. Herreweghe, who used two soprano and two bass soloists in the recording, settled for one of each here, leaving both to grapple with uncomfortably low numbers.</p>
        <p>Still, it was an evening of wonderful and imaginative music-making from both singers and players. The trumpeters were especially fine, even to matching some of their trills. (The horn soloist in the ''Quoniam,'' was a notable exception, faltering badly throughout, while iconically representing Jesus, no less, as George B. Stauffer pointed out in a preconcert lecture.)</p>
        <p>We are sure to hear more of these performers soon. Meanwhile, the ''Bach Celebration'' ends with the four orchestral suites, performed tonight by Philip Pickett and the New London Consort, and the larger festival ends more predictably, with Mozart's C minor Mass tomorrow and on Saturday.</p>
