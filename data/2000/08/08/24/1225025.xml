        <p>Intel introduced a chip design intended for use in a wide variety of wireless Internet and networking infrastructure applications. Called the Intel XScale microarchitecture, it has the flexibility to handle requirements for both ultralow power and high performance in devices ranging from Internet-ready cell phones to Internet infrastructure equipment. Intel's XScale is actually a renamed version of the StrongArm architecture Intel acquired from the Digital Equipment Corporation, which was originally based on a design created by Advanced Risc Machines of Britain. The technology is notable for its ability to operate at high speeds while consuming little power, a key requirement for a new generation of battery-powered mobile devices. Intel said the new design would allow the development of new types of wireless devices powered by a single AA battery.</p>
