      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial criticizes Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney for failing to avoid 'ethical minefield' in negotiating retirement package with oil industry giant Halliburton Co which allows him to keep 400,000 more stock options than normal that will vest during possible term in office; urges him to do right thing by relinquishing options to eliminate any potential conflicts of interest (M)</p>

        <p>Dick Cheney became wealthy at the helm of the Halliburton Company over the past five years. At today's stock price, the value of his shares, restricted shares and vested stock options granted him during his tenure adds up to more than $30 million. That is compensation awarded to Mr. Cheney for his past service, and is perfectly appropriate, provided he sells these assets if elected vice president and puts the proceeds in a blind trust to eliminate any potential conflicts of interest.</p>
        <p>But Americans should wonder why the Dallas-based oil services company went further and allowed Mr. Cheney to keep 400,000 more stock options that he would ordinarily have had to work additional years to acquire. Under the terms of his employment contract, Mr. Cheney could have retired at age 62 and by that time would have earned these additional options. But as part of his retirement package, Halliburton's board of directors allowed Mr. Cheney to retire at age 59 and still keep these options. The board also accelerated the vesting of some restricted shares. That special favor, worth at least $6 million at today's prices and potentially a lot more, would tie Mr. Cheney's financial fortunes to those of the company -- and therefore to the price of oil -- well into a potential Bush-Cheney administration. Mr. Cheney should have turned the favor down, and taken only the substantial stake he had already earned.</p>

        <p>Dick Cheney became wealthy at the helm of the Halliburton Company over the past five years. At today's stock price, the value of his shares, restricted shares and vested stock options granted him during his tenure adds up to more than $30 million. That is compensation awarded to Mr. Cheney for his past service, and is perfectly appropriate, provided he sells these assets if elected vice president and puts the proceeds in a blind trust to eliminate any potential conflicts of interest.</p>
        <p>But Americans should wonder why the Dallas-based oil services company went further and allowed Mr. Cheney to keep 400,000 more stock options that he would ordinarily have had to work additional years to acquire. Under the terms of his employment contract, Mr. Cheney could have retired at age 62 and by that time would have earned these additional options. But as part of his retirement package, Halliburton's board of directors allowed Mr. Cheney to retire at age 59 and still keep these options. The board also accelerated the vesting of some restricted shares. That special favor, worth at least $6 million at today's prices and potentially a lot more, would tie Mr. Cheney's financial fortunes to those of the company -- and therefore to the price of oil -- well into a potential Bush-Cheney administration. Mr. Cheney should have turned the favor down, and taken only the substantial stake he had already earned.</p>
        <p>Halliburton is being generous to a fault. The purpose of an employment contract and of stock options with staggered vesting periods is to retain valued employees. There is no legitimate reason for Halliburton shareholders to compensate Mr. Cheney for leaving early to seek the vice presidency. Nor should they be asked to supplement his government salary. Clearly, the company would not be allowing Mr. Cheney to keep the additional options if he were going to work for a competitor.</p>
        <p>Halliburton maintains that it is not treating Mr. Cheney any differently than it would other highly valued employees who opt to retire early. But the vice-presidential candidate is not just another retiree. And while the company may be excused for wanting to ingratiate itself with a man who could be the next president's chief lieutenant, if not president himself someday, Mr. Cheney should know better than to find himself in this situation. It is true that there are no laws barring the arrangement, but it is a matter of judgment.</p>
        <p>What makes the situation especially troubling is the nature of the industry itself. Oil touches on everything from relations with Venezuela to wildlife preservation in Alaska, from Middle East politics to the automobile industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney has said he will do whatever is needed to avoid any conflict of interest. He is reportedly conferring with lawyers about how best to handle the thorny ethical issue posed by the 400,000 options, which are scheduled to vest late this year, in 2001 and in 2002. To his credit, Mr. Cheney has indicated he will place his assets in a blind trust if elected vice president. But these options cannot be transferred, not even to a trust. It is baffling that a man of Mr. Cheney's supposed sophistication would not have avoided this ethical minefield in negotiating his retirement package.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's lawyers and financial advisers may yet find a way to prevent him from having a stake in future swings in the price of oil. A Wall Street firm could sign a contract on his options, locking in his proceeds from the sale of that stock now. But this would not address the unseemly fact that Halliburton has been unduly generous to a man who stands a good chance of becoming vice president.</p>
        <p>Instead of lawyers and bankers, Mr. Cheney needs to summon all of his gravitas and do the right thing. That means he should just say no to any options that would vest after he is in office.</p>
