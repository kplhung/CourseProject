        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''PC 101: Pitfalls to Avoid'' (State of the Art, Aug. 10) points out that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is requiring its students to own laptop computers. I was ready to buy my daughter a Mac laptop to take to college, even though she was used to PC's, but I first called the college's computer laboratory. I found out that the college was indeed able to handle PC's as well as Macs, and the person I talked to recommended against a laptop, which costs more and does less than a desktop. In a matter of minutes I went from being on the verge of buying a Mac laptop to going back to a PC desktop, and that saved me up to $1,000. I recommend that parents who are confused about what computer to get their college freshmen call people in the college's computer lab and ask their opinions.</p>
