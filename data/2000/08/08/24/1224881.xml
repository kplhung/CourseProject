        <p>LEONARD LA FRANCE, an engineer in Lake Tahoe, Nev., was intrigued when he heard about a new product for his television, a gadget that would search for the programs he wanted, automatically recording them on a hard drive, and would allow him to put live programs on ''pause'' and skip commercials at the press of a button.</p>
        <p>But last winter, when he rushed to the local electronics retailer, Good Guys, searching for one of the devices, known as a digital video recorder, the salespeople didn't know about it, he said.</p>
        <p>Not one to give up easily, Mr. LaFrance walked around the store until he found one.</p>
        <p>''They had it on the floor, and they didn't know about it,'' he said. ''They didn't even put it next to the VCR's -- it was somewhere else.''</p>
        <p>There is no question that digital video recorders -- also known as personal video recorders or by the brand names of the two competing services, TiVo and ReplayTV -- are a powerful and, for many, an attractive technology. Online reviews at Web sites like Deja.com, ePinions and Amazon.com brim with glowing testimonials on the order of, ''How did I watch TV before this?''</p>
        <p>Some analysts even suggest that the DVR will help reshape commercial television by giving people the power to program their own personalized networks, watching programs whenever they want and completely avoiding commercials. With a DVR, for example, a Humphrey Bogart fan can instruct the machine to find and record all Bogart movies that are broadcast, then can watch them at will, skipping the advertisements.</p>
        <p>Despite their promise, however, DVR's have not flown off the shelves since they were first introduced a little more than a year ago. Philips Electronics and Sony devices use the TiVo service, while Panasonic and Sharp receivers use the ReplayTV service, and ReplayTV also offers its own hardware. TiVo devices, the most highly promoted of the brands, sold about 48,000 units in their first year. About 9,500 of ReplayTV's own boxes were shipped to retailers in 1999. Panasonic started selling ReplayTV devices in May, and sales figures were not available; Sharp is just getting into the market.</p>
        <p>The DVR is a good example of how even relatively easy-to-use technology with a huge potential market can be slow off the mark. While price is an issue -- the units cost from $99, with a monthly fee of $9.95, to $499 -- there are thornier problems, like getting consumers to understand a product that has too many features to sum up neatly in an advertising slogan.</p>
        <p>And even if consumers understand the product, will millions feel that it is useful enough -- and different enough from a VCR -- that they cannot do without it? Or will DVR's go the way of, say, quadraphonic sound, which was introduced in the 1970's as the next big thing in audio but was rejected by consumers?</p>
        <p>The companies are betting that the DVR will not fizzle. (ReplayTV's partners include Time Warner and the Sundance Channel, and TiVo's include America Online, CBS and Disney. Showtime and NBC are partners of both services.) The companies point to a high level of satisfaction among early adopters, some of whom liked it so much that they bought a second or third unit. The companies have little doubt that more consumers will eventually see how convenient the DVR is, and how much more it can do than a VCR. But they acknowledge that DVR's can be a tough sell.</p>
        <p>''Until people get their hands on it,'' said Rebecca Baer, a spokeswoman for TiVo, ''they don't understand why they need this.'' Salespeople who want quick sales often do not have the time to promote a new technology, she said. ''The retail environment is an extremely hostile one,'' she said, ''especially for products that require education.''</p>
        <p>One problem facing DVR's, as Mr. LaFrance found, is that salespeople often know little about the machines, even though they have been on the market for more than a year. ''The retailers that sell it don't push it,'' Mr. LaFrance said. ''I don't understand it because it's a big ticket item.'' Mr. LaFrance now owns two DVR's and has a third on order -- one for each one of his televisions. A fan of science, he uses one just to search for and record science programs.</p>
        <p>To educate salespeople, the companies are sending out marketers to conduct demonstrations in stores.</p>
        <p>Jim Hollingsworth, the senior vice president for sales and marketing at ReplayTV, said his company would put on 10,000 demonstrations nationwide -- in stores like Circuit City, Best Buy and The Wiz -- between now and end of the year.</p>
        <p>TiVo plans about 1,000 demonstrations this year. It has just built a traveling demonstration theater in a tractor-trailer that will tour 25 cities this year.</p>
        <p>One barrier to consumer acceptance may be that in addition to a cable or satellite hookup, each DVR needs access to a phone line to download information about broadcast schedules. While that phone line can still be used for calls or data transmission, some consumers may be reluctant to hook up another device to a phone line or install another jack. Stores have also been slow to hook showroom DVR's up to phone lines, even though a DVR needs a phone line to show how it can track programs.</p>
        <p>To address consumers more directly, both TiVo and ReplayTV have commissioned advertising campaigns. One TiVo advertisement was banned by CBS because it tried to make the point that network programmers were obsolete by showing a pair of bouncers marching into a programmer's office and throwing him out the window. An advertisement for ReplayTV shows a boxing match in which a viewer hits Pause to freeze the action, leaving the boxers standing around, waiting to resume. The punch line is, ''Pausing live TV -- weird, isn't it?''</p>
        <p>Both companies say their goal is to stir up attention. The difficulty is that neither advertising campaign really answers the question as to what a DVR is. What they are, and how they differ from VCR's, is not an easy question to answer in 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>''If a logical prospect does not understand the product,'' said John Roberts, a former marketing executive with Sony who is now with Gotham Advertising in New York, ''it's hard to say the product is well served -- unless there's so much buzz and hype that the information is already taken cre of.''</p>
        <p>DVR's are, in fact, both a piece of hardware (each one has a hard drive that can hold 20 to 30 hours of low-resolution television, or 7 to 10 hours of high-resolution programs, for later viewing) and a service that tracks down the programs a viewer wants even if they are delayed or rescheduled.</p>
        <p>The hardware is plugged into a telephone line so it can call the service daily for schedule updates and software enhancements. It is also plugged into the homeowner's cable or satellite box.</p>
        <p>One of the DVR's big attention grabbers is the ability to make a live television program pause, then continue the show without skipping a single word of ''NYPD Blue,'' for instance -- even if a pizza arrives in the middle of the show. That is possible because the device is recording whatever is being watched. When viewers resume watching, they are actually seeing recorded material.  But more compelling to viewers is the DVR's ability to sort through the numerous channels to find programs the viewer likes so they are never missed.</p>
        <p>BRIAN KUSLER, a product manager at a software company, CrowdBurst.com in San Francisco, bought the first model of TiVo so he would not miss his favorite sports event, the Tour de France bicycle race. ''ESPN treats it one step below soccer, and they would move it without telling you,'' he said. ''Now even if the listing changes, TiVo still finds it.''</p>
        <p>Both TiVo and ReplayTV allow users to configure the listings to display only programs of the type they want to watch, so there are fewer listings for the viewer to scan. The daily schedule of shows is then available in an on-screen guide. The DVR's can be set to record specific programs, or any shows it finds with a specific actor.</p>
        <p>The services will also monitor what the viewer watches and suggest that similar programs be recorded. With TiVo, the suggestions become more refined as the viewer approves or disapproves of the suggestions, using a button on a remote control.</p>
        <p>''You have to get used to it,'' said Charles Weiss, a photo assignment editor at The Baltimore Sun. ''It changes the way you watch television. I sit down with the remote and my impulse is to channel-surf, but then I go to the listings, very quickly find out what is on, and go to the show I want to watch.'' He keeps a cache of ''Seinfeld'' and ''Drew Carey Show'' episodes on hand.</p>
        <p>A DVR's recording capability may not seem that different from a VCR's, but a viewer can make a DVR recording with one push of a button and without setting a timer.  Most VCR owners cannot even set the clock, and they seldom -- if ever -- use the timer to record a show. With a DVR, the viewer chooses programs from an on-screen menu, and the machine does the rest. The machines are not intended for the long-term storage of programs -- for that, the programs can be transferred to a VCR.</p>
        <p>The DVD's recording feature was particularly important for Mr. Kusler, who keeps a stock of ''Star Trek: Voyager,'' ''Ally McBeal'' and ''South Park'' on hand. ''I don't watch a lot of TV,'' he said, ''but I'd come home and the things I wanted to see weren't on.''</p>
        <p>DVR's also let viewers skip commercials. TiVo has a fast forward button that is similar to the one on a VCR. ReplayTV has a button that skips ahead in 30-second chunks (if the program is running at least 30 seconds ahead), which was the main reason that Mr. LaFrance bought his. ''I was so fed up with commercials,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Of course, those features do not necessarily come cheap. And consumers who are not familiar with the features of a DVR are likely to look at the price and buy a VCR instead, Mr. Roberts said.</p>
        <p>''Think about VCR's,'' he said. ''Everyone has one, and it's cheap. You have to be an idiot to spend more than $200.'' Even entry-level DVR's with a recording time of 14 hours were selling for about $500 during the critical Christmas sales period last year.</p>
        <p>The companies have responded by lowering prices. This year, a low-end TiVo unit sells for $99, not including the program-listings service, which is $10 a month or $199 for the life of the unit ( for a total of $298).</p>
        <p>Basic ReplayTV units start at $299, with service included. Top-of-the-line models, which record up to 30 hours of television, sell for $599, without the current $100 rebate.</p>
        <p>That $299 price may be a pivotal number, according to Gordon Hodge, a media analyst for Thomas Weisel Partners, an investment firm in San Francisco. ''When DVD and MP3 moved into that range, it seemed to be a magic price point,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another barrier is the ''teeter factor,'' said Mr. Hodge, who owns a TiVo and uses it to record sports events. ''There's a lot of clutter in the family room,'' he said. ''Do you really want to stack another box on the others teetering on top of the TV?''</p>
        <p>Both DVR companies say that before Christmas, they will release ''combo boxes,'' which will put a DVR in the same box as a satellite television set-top controller (Sony's combo box will cost $399, the same price as the stand-alone recorder). The combo box will not only reduce clutter but will also piggyback DVR sales on the high sales volume of satellite television service. Mr. Hodge estimates that TiVo will sell more than 100,000 units on the strength of the combo box. ReplayTV is not a public company yet and has not fully divulged its balance sheets, so Mr. Hodge had no projections for its sales.</p>
        <p>DVR's may be easy to use, but some buyers have complained that they are not easy to set up. Not every configuration of devices is covered in the manuals, and even the basic instructions might be daunting for someone who just wants to plug in the device and turn it on.</p>
        <p>In a test, setting up the TiVo initially required two phone calls to customer service, about an hour to configure the system and about three hours for the system to download and install its software. The ReplayTV, which allows more programming customization than TiVo, took less time to  download its software, but it required a lot of time poring over the manual to configure and learn its features.</p>
        <p>Of the two units, the TiVo was easiest to use. It has an curvy, comfortable remote control with an intuitive arrangement of buttons. The ReplayTV remote control had more features, but lots of small buttons that could vex someone with less than perfect vision. It also required an occasional look at the manual to locate a feature on the remote control (the quick skip, which jumps 30 seconds at a clip for excising commercials, eluded the tester for two days).</p>
        <p>As with any new electronic product, some users have reported technical difficulties. One of them is Robert Hill, an executive recruiter from Leesburg, Va., who likes to tape old ''Saturday Night Live'' shows and vintage movies. ''I had the thing for about six weeks,'' he said, ''and all of a sudden the thing wouldn't -- the phrase I would use is boot up.'' He exchanged it for a new unit but still experiences some problems, he said.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes when it is recording it will switch off early,'' Mr. Hill said, ''so you'll get 1 3/4 hours for a Hitchcock movie, then it changes channels. So you miss the last 15 minutes.'' But he does not mind. ''To tell you the truth, I've seen most of them before,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>The companies are hustling to iron out glitches while still introducing new products. ReplayTV has announced that it will make personal programming available on the Internet so people can tell their units to tape shows their co-workers discussed at water coolers that day and have them ready for viewing after work. TiVo is working on a similar service.</p>
        <p>Despite all the promotion, the companies say that when it comes to brand-new technology, the public cannot be rushed. ''We have an educational challenge to help people understand what TiVo is,'' said Mike Ramsey, the chief executive of TiVo. ''It's more than just spending money on marketing -- it takes time.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the best salespeople may be users like Mr. Kusler.</p>
        <p>''People come over, I forget I have it and pause the TV, and they want to know how I did that,'' he said. ''I think I've personally sold about five of them, maybe six.''</p>
        <p>ReplayTV or TiVo?</p>
        <p>Following is a comparison of the Panasonic ShowStopper 2000, which is a ReplayTV unit, and the Sony SVR-2000, a TiVo model.</p>
        <p>PRICE -- Panasonic/ReplayTV: $599,  program service included. Sony/ TiVo: $399, plus $199 for service.</p>
        <p>RECORDING TIME -- Both models allow 30 hours of recording at lowest quality, 10 hours at highest quality.</p>
        <p>SEARCH FEATURES -- Panasonic/ReplayTV: search by actor, director, title, program description. Sony/TiVo: search by title, time, channel and preset genres.</p>
        <p>FAST FORWARD -- Panasonic/ReplayTV: 5 speeds. Sony/TiVo: 3.</p>
        <p>SKIP FORWARD -- Panasonic/ReplayTV: 30-second jump. Sony/TiVo: not available.</p>
        <p>PROGRAM FILTER -- Panasonic/ReplayTV: not available. Sony/TiVo: available in next software upgrade.</p>
