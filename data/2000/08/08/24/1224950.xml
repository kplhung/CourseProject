        <p>Kellen Winslow is acutely aware of what is happening in his neighborhood, his town, his country and beyond. He is a Hall of Fame tight end from the San Diego Chargers who can talk about world events as deftly as he can about current National Football League tight ends who are fearless across the middle.</p>
        <p>Winslow was in Manhattan yesterday to lend his name to a new cause that he knows affects his world and yours.</p>
        <p>Beginning Sept. 5, fans may vote on nfl.com for the player whose performance from the previous week was the most gritty, the player who exhibited the most heart. Each Thursday during the season, the league will count the votes and award the All-Heart Player of the Week award, part of an effort by the N.F.L. to educate people about heart disease.</p>
        <p>''I'm a member of a high-risk group because I have had hypertension in my family,'' Winslow said. ''This is something people should know about and monitor. You can't address a problem unless you know you have a problem. And especially in the African-American community, I'm concerned about the tendency to go for these kind of tests only after you get sick.''</p>
        <p>Winslow, 42, who lives in San Diego, is the perfect spokesman for such a program.</p>
        <p>He grew up in East St. Louis, Ill., played football at the University of Missouri and earned a degree in counseling psychology there, played with the Chargers from 1979 through 1987 and then earned a law degree from the University of San Diego. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1995. He is currently commissioner of the 21-team Indoor Football League and is a college football analyst for Fox Sports Net.</p>
        <p>But there is one game, one singular achievement that will always be Winslow's signature: a 41-38 overtime playoff victory for the Chargers against Miami in the Orange Bowl on Jan. 2, 1982.</p>
        <p>In that game, Winslow caught 13 passes, a playoff record, for 166 yards, scored on a 25-yard reception and blocked a field-goal attempt. He was seemingly everywhere that night and played in a soiled uniform, in a jersey that became untucked, and kept playing despite several stitches in his bloody lip and despite losing 12 pounds of water weight.</p>
        <p>When coaches talk about playing football with passion, about leaving everything on the field, they are talking about Winslow in the Orange Bowl.</p>
        <p>''I hear about that game every day of my life, every time I leave my house or even when I stay home -- somebody calls and wants to talk about it on the phone,'' Winslow said. ''People have sent me letters saying they named their kid after me, boys and girls, because they want them to produce that kind of effort in their lives. A man told me his wife was having a baby during the game and would not leave for the hospital until he agreed to have a miniature TV in the car. The funny thing is, I had played better in other games. But I guess in that game I was pushed to the mountaintop and passed that test. I could truly say that game I gave my all.''</p>
        <p>Why isn't Winslow running an N.F.L. franchise? He said that after he gained his law degree he asked the Chargers for a chance in their front office but was told there was no room for him. He is bitter about that. ''I think it's something I could be good at,'' Winslow said. But Winslow had too much heart to let bitterness ruin him. He moved on.</p>
        <p>The league will post five players each week as candidates for the All-Heart award, sponsored by the N.F.L. and Merck, the pharmaceutical company, to make the public aware of the effect of cholesterol in heart disease.</p>
        <p>Winslow said he would watch closely, because the nominees and winners ''should not necessarily be the guy who catches 10 passes and two for touchdowns.'' Winslow's early favorites for the first winner?</p>
        <p>''I'd go with Junior Seau of the Chargers -- every play, every game, he gives 100 percent,'' Winslow said. ''Jevon Kearse of Tennessee, he has a nonstop motor and the motor is the heart. Edgerrin James of the Colts runs, blocks and catches. Peyton Manning of the Colts leads with discipline and character. Hey, and I'd pick a coach like Dan Reeves, who has fought back from heart disease in a manner few have.''</p>
        <p>Winslow said to keep an eye this season on four tight ends: Tony Gonzalez of Kansas City, Bubba Franks of Green Bay, Rickey Dudley of Oakland and Shannon Sharpe of Baltimore. He will do that, and also looks at Washington, Tennessee and Tampa Bay as three teams he believes are ahead in the Super Bowl race.</p>
        <p>''This All-Heart Award will be about effort, performance and desire,'' Winslow said. ''You know, respect is not about money, fame or intimidation. It is something you earn.''</p>
        <p>As Winslow did.</p>
