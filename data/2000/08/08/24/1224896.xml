        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You reported (news article, Aug. 17) that New York City shut an unlicensed medical clinic serving Chinese immigrants, most of whom lacked health insurance. And an Aug. 19 news article described the survivors of the West Nile virus, including a Polish immigrant in Westchester County who is eligible only for emergency Medicaid, which covered her hospitalization but not rehabilitation services.</p>
        <p>These are the faces behind the changes in federal law that effectively deny Medicaid and State Child Health Insurance to most immigrants who entered the country after August 1996. Last year, 46 percent of immigrants in New York City did not have health insurance.</p>

        <p>New York has extended its Child Health Insurance Program to immigrant children, legal and undocumented, and has considered making Medicaid or its new Family Health Plus Program available to low-income adult immigrants. The growing numbers of immigrants without health insurance will require New York to step into the void created by the federal government.</p>
