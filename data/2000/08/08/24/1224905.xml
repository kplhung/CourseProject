        <p>Cambridge University opened a campaign today to keep the papers of its alumnus Sir Isaac Newton in Britain, seeking donations to prevent part of the scientist's legacy from falling prey to the gravitational pull of outside buyers and market forces as powerful as the natural laws he chronicled.</p>
        <p>At issue is the privately owned Macclesfield Newton Collection, an assemblage of letters, notebooks and autographed texts relating to Sir Isaac's work on calculus, optics, mathematics and gravity.

        <p>Cambridge University opened a campaign today to keep the papers of its alumnus Sir Isaac Newton in Britain, seeking donations to prevent part of the scientist's legacy from falling prey to the gravitational pull of outside buyers and market forces as powerful as the natural laws he chronicled.</p>
        <p>At issue is the privately owned Macclesfield Newton Collection, an assemblage of letters, notebooks and autographed texts relating to Sir Isaac's work on calculus, optics, mathematics and gravity. The collection, held by the Macclesfield family since the 18th century, complements a Newtonian archive that has been at Cambridge's University Library since 1872.</p>
        <p>The current Earl of Macclesfield -- the ninth -- is offering to sell the collection, through Sotheby's, to Cambridge University for around $9.56 million. Britain's National Lottery has offered to put up three quarters of the cost. The remaining quarter, $2.39 million, needs to be covered by the university, which is seeking benefactors to foot the bill.</p>
        <p>''If we can't raise this money, the danger is that the collection might go abroad and be split amongst private collectors, which would be a tragedy for scholars and a great loss for the nation as a whole,'' said Peter Fox, the Cambridge University librarian.</p>
        <p>In a joint statement, Cambridge and Sotheby's, which brokered the sale of the papers, called the collection ''arguably the most important and valuable collection of scientific papers in private hands in Britain.''</p>
        <p>To reinforce the campaign, Cambridge has enlisted a string of supporters ranging from Carol Vorderman, a television game-show presenter with a vaunted gift for mathematics, to Prof. Stephen Hawking, who holds the same Lucasian chair at Cambridge that Newton secured in 1669. ''These papers are important to show how his ideas developed,'' Professor Hawking said. ''Science doesn't appear out of the blue. It's a series of steps.''</p>
        <p>Lord Macclesfield is selling the collection to raise money to maintain his family seat and its art collections at Shirburn Castle in Oxfordshire, according to Sotheby's. He said in a statement that Cambridge -- where Newton first studied in 1661 -- was ''clearly the best place'' for the archive.</p>
        <p>Paul Quarrie, the senior specialist in Sotheby's book department, said the collection was donated to the Macclesfield family in the 18th century by William Jones, an astronomer who had acquired them from a friend of Newton.</p>
        <p>He said the collection comprised  bound volumes of letters, notebooks and loose papers. ''The most valuable are 50-plus letters and a great number of autographed documents'' dealing with calculus and gravity, he said. Until now, Mr. Quarrie said, the collection had been kept ''in a cupboard'' at the Earl of Macclesfield's home.</p>
        <p>Cambridge is especially keen to obtain the collection because it already holds the Portsmouth Collection, presented by the fifth Earl of Portsmouth in 1872, and the two archives complement one another.</p>
        <p>''Many of the letters included in the Portsmouth archive have their replies among the documents held by the Earl of Macclesfield,'' Cambridge University said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's said it had set an unspecified time limit for Cambridge to raise its share of the money, but Mr. Quarrie said, ''We are not going to quibble over a month or two.''</p>
