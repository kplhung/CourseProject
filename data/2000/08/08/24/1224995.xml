        <p>A new study finds that estrogen replacement therapy, which doctors have long hoped will prevent heart disease in postmenopausal women, does nothing to slow the disease's progression in those whose arteries have already been partly blocked by it.</p>
        <p>The study is being reported in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. But another study, in the same issue, cites the hormone therapy as a factor -- along with beneficial diet, exercise and avoidance of tobacco -- in the decline of heart disease among women. An editorial accompanying the studies says women will not know whether hormone therapy protects the heart until larger studies are completed in several years.</p>
        <p>As many as 10 million American women take estrogen replacement therapy; Premarin, an estrogen made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, is the nation's best-selling prescription drug. The drug was approved for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, like hot flashes, and for the management of osteoporosis, but there has also been a widespread belief among doctors and women that it will protect against heart disease, the leading killer of American women. Heart disease is rare among premenopausal women, but its incidence begins rising in middle age.</p>
        <p>In one study being reported today,  investigators injected women's coronary arteries with a dye and then examined the arteries with X-rays. They found that the women's arteries gradually narrowed as the three-year study progressed, whether or not they took estrogen.</p>
        <p>Dr. David M. Herrington, a cardiovascular epidemiologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, the lead author of the new artery study, said he began the work in hopes of confirming the belief that  estrogen would help women with  heart disease.</p>
        <p>A study reported previously,  called HERS, had already shown discouraging results, but some researchers wondered whether the reason might be that the women in it took either a combination of estrogen and methoxyprogesterone, or a placebo. Some experts proposed that if the women took estrogen alone, the hormone would protect their hearts.</p>
        <p>So the 309 women in Dr. Herrington's study were randomly assigned to take estrogen alone, estrogen plus methoxyprogesterone, or a placebo.</p>
        <p>''I was still hopeful that there would be an underlying effect on the progression of atherosclerosis,'' Dr. Herrington said. Now, he said, he thinks the question has been answered.</p>
        <p>''I think this study, coupled with the HERS trial, is a pretty compelling combination of evidence showing that estrogen replacement therapy is not effective in reducing the risk for heart attacks or heart-disease deaths, or for slowing the disease that's responsible for those heart attacks, in women with established heart disease,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Others agreed.</p>
        <p>''I think it's very convincing that after three years in a well-designed study, there was no evidence of benefit,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor, a professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of California at San Diego.</p>
        <p>But the artery study and the HERS study do not address the question of whether hormone therapy at menopause can prevent the development of heart disease in women who do not yet have it.</p>
        <p>Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, the scientific director for clinical research at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said she was withholding judgment on the question of whether hormone replacement therapy protects against heart disease. She noted that the average age of the women in the study of artery narrowing was 65, long after they had entered menopause.</p>
        <p>''Would hormone replacement therapy possibly be more effective if it was initiated at the onset of menopause?'' Dr. Nabel asked.</p>
        <p>In addition, she said that while the women in Dr. Herrington's study  were followed for only three years, ''it may be that protective effects may be apparent only years later.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, most experts said, the data are not encouraging.</p>
        <p>They added that a study now under way, involving 25,000 women, most of whom did not have heart disease, was also finding hints that estrogen might not help women's hearts.</p>
        <p>In April, directors of that study,  known as the Women's Health Initiative, informed its participants that those taking estrogen were having slightly more heart attacks than those taking a placebo, possibly because of estrogen's well-known proclivity to encourage blood clots in susceptible women.</p>
        <p>The finding reminded scientists of data from the HERS study, which looked for heart attacks in women who already had heart disease. There, too, the women taking estrogen initially had more heart attacks. But later the incidence of heart attacks declined, so that in the end estrogen had no effect on heart attack incidence.</p>
        <p>Dr. Deborah Grady, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California at San Francisco, said the preliminary results from the Women's Health Initiative made it statistically unlikely that hormone replacement therapy would turn out to prevent heart disease. ''It's very unlikely in my mind that they will ever be able to show an overall benefit,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, a study being published today alongside Dr. Herrington's on artery narrowing attributed a reduction in heart disease among women in part to hormone replacement therapy. While it was not a randomized trial -- that is, the women chose to take estrogen or not to take it -- it was huge: Dr. Walter C. Willett of the Harvard School of Public Health and his colleagues followed 85,941 female nurses for 14 years.</p>
        <p>But epidemiologists said non-randomized studies could be misleading. And, in fact, such studies previously indicated that estrogen could slow the progress of heart disease, making it all the more surprising when it did not and stunning some who had believed in the treatment.</p>
