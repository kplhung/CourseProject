        <p>Less than two weeks after the Giuliani administration announced a ban on alcohol sales along parade routes, city officials have backed off a Police Department proposal to end such sales at street festivals. Instead, yesterday they notified the Feast of San Gennaro, the 11-day festival held in September in Little Italy, that alcohol sales would be permitted but that the number of vendors would be cut in half.</p>
        <p>The city had considered a ban on alcohol sales at all outdoor events after the sexual assaults following the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on June 11. The ban on such sales at large parades came on Aug. 7, part of safety rules adopted in response to three deaths at last year's West Indian American Carnival Parade in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>But Rosemarie O'Keefe, the commissioner of the Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, which issues festival permits, said the city agreed to the compromise for all street fairs after discussions with the producers of San Gennaro, a festival now entering its 74th year, which starts Sept. 14.</p>
        <p>In addition to cutting the number of alcohol vending permits to half the number issued last year, Ms. O'Keefe said, the new  policy requires festivals to stop selling alcohol one to two hours before their nightly closing time, limits sales to two drinks per person, and restricts drink sizes to 12 ounces for beer and 4 ounces for wine. In the past, there were no restrictions on the number of permits, or the number and size of drinks. Alcohol booths shut down at the same time as other vendors.</p>
        <p>The new policy came under immediate attack yesterday, both from organizers of parades, who complained of a double standard, and from San Gennaro organizers, who were unhappy with the restrictions on their permits.</p>
        <p>''It looks like one set of rules go for one group, and another for the others,'' said Jean Alexander, the marketing director for the West Indian American Carnival Parade.</p>
        <p>''You don't have to have alcohol to have a carnival,'' Ms. Alexander said. ''I could dance and play a flute all day long and never take a drink.'' But she said the policy had larger implications for tourism and the carnival parade's finances.</p>
        <p>Beer and liquor companies have withdrawn their sponsorships, she said, and social clubs that participate are having difficulty getting alcohol permits for fund-raisers for the elaborate costumes that draw two million spectators to Eastern Parkway every year.</p>
        <p>The organizers of the Feast of San Gennaro were no happier with the policy, saying the cut in permits would mean less revenue that could be donated to charity at the end of the festival.</p>
        <p>''The only explanation the city has provided is that this is a 'quality of life' decision,'' the festival said in a written statement released yesterday. ''We see it as dictating a 'control of life' policy.''</p>
        <p>At first, the city told the festival there would be no alcohol sales, said Arnold N. Kriss, the lawyer for Figlia di San Gennaro, the nonprofit group that organizes the festival. But after discussions, the city agreed to allow 33 permits instead of the 65 the festival had last year, when there were no limits on permits.</p>
        <p>Twenty-two additional permits go to restaurants, which are already licensed to sell alcohol but set up extra booths during the festival, Mr. Kriss said.</p>
        <p>He estimated the loss to the festival at $100,000, adding that San Gennaro had donated $800,000 to charities over the past four years.</p>
        <p>City officials have argued that they are simply correcting an inconsistency in the law, which forbids drinking on public streets but has allowed vendors at parades and festivals to sell alcohol. Ms. O'Keefe said no festival or parade organizers had complained directly to the city about the policy, and one producer of several festivals said he would not apply for any alcohol permits.</p>
        <p>The change in policy had been requested by the Police Department, Ms. O'Keefe said, but community groups' opinions also affected the decision.</p>
        <p>''Just as many people as love these festivals don't like them,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kriss criticized the city for issuing the new policy only three weeks before the feast begins, leaving his client without enough time to litigate the change.</p>
        <p>''They've got us between a rock and a hard place,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He also said he did not understand why the police could not simply patrol festivals and parades. ''The New York Police Department does a fine job,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Lt. Stephen Biegel, a police spokseman, said it was a ''quality of life issue.''</p>
        <p>''We can take care of the problems,'' Lieutenant Biegel said. ''Wouldn't it be better not to have problems at all? Why have problems from alcohol, when we can eliminate the alcohol and get rid of the problems.''</p>
        <p>City officials have said privately in the past that the new policy is a response to the sexual assaults that followed this year's National Puerto Rican Day Parade, in which women were attacked and in some cases undressed by aggressive crowds of men.</p>
        <p>But Ms. O'Keefe did not attribute the change to any one problem. ''We've had a few incidents at a few events, and we just needed to look at what's happened,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She blamed crowd spillover, public urination, and destruction of property. ''And I'm not saying it's because of the drunks,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The city was considering further restrictions on outdoor events, she said, including reducing the number of city blocks used.</p>
