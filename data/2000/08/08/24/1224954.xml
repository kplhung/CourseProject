        <p>The campaigns of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio traded charges and insults yesterday over Mr. Lazio's record on hate crimes legislation.</p>

        <p>The campaigns of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio traded charges and insults yesterday over Mr. Lazio's record on hate crimes legislation.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign said that Mr. Lazio was a weak supporter of the legislation and was ''talking out of both sides of his mouth,'' while Mr. Lazio's campaign said that Mrs. Clinton's criticism proved that she was a ''legislative lightweight'' who lacked the ''policy gravitas'' to be senator.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton began the volleys in a news conference on the City Hall steps. Speaking with Democratic politicians and civil rights advocates, the first lady urged the House of Representatives to pass legislation that would strengthen current laws against hate crimes. She added, ''My opponent does not support federal hate crimes legislation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio was on a Massachusetts fund-raising trip yesterday to Boston and Nantucket Island, but his campaign immediately responded that Mrs. Clinton was distorting Mr. Lazio's record. ''He does support the federal bill,'' said Dan McLagan, Mr. Lazio's chief spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, however, is not one of the 192 co-sponsors of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999, which Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, termed an indication of the congressman's lackluster support. ''Hillary Clinton understands that if you really support a bill, you have the guts to co-sponsor it and not try to hide behind flimsy excuses,'' Mr. Wolfson said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, responded in a statement that Mrs. Clinton was in a state of ''confusion'' about the difference between co-sponsoring and supporting legislation, and said that Mr. Lazio would vote for the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio did in fact support a New York State hate crimes bill that Gov. George E. Pataki signed into law last month, but only after the bill passed and after first wavering on his position. The law represented the first time that the words ''gay'' and ''lesbian'' and the phrase ''sexual orientation'' appeared in New York State laws. Republicans had balked for years at including such language.</p>
        <p>The logic behind laws against hate crimes -- those committed by people who single out their victims on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation or age -- is that the crimes are seen as posing a greater threat not only to individuals but to communities. .</p>
