        <p>On Monday night, Wanda Arroyo took her 3-year-old daughter, Crystal, to Coney Island to look at the stuffed animals on the midway, a law enforcement official said yesterday.</p>
        <p>But at the end of the evening, the official said, Ms. Arroyo, 39, returned home to Bedford-Stuyvesant alone, leaving the child behind.</p>
        <p>Crystal was found wandering in the courtyard of the Luna Park Houses not far from Coney Island's amusement area at 9 p.m. Monday, unable to tell the police her correct name, let alone where she lived, 29 subway stops away.</p>
        <p>And yesterday morning, after 36 hours of searching for Crystal's mother, two police officers disguised as maintenance workers burst into Ms. Arroyo's apartment in the Eleanor Roosevelt Houses on DeKalb Avenue and took her to a police station for questioning, the police and witnesses said.</p>
        <p>By evening, they had charged her with child abandonment, a felony, and endangering the welfare of a child, the police said.</p>
        <p>Detectives, who found Ms. Arroyo with help from people who saw Crystal's photo in newspapers and on television, used the woman's own MetroCard to crack the case, said the law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>At first, he said, Ms. Arroyo denied having taken Crystal to Coney Island. But by reading information off a MetroCard found in her apartment, the detectives saw that the card had been used at 10 p.m. Monday at the Stillwell Avenue station in Coney Island, the official said.</p>
        <p>At that point, Ms. Arroyo admitted that she had taken Crystal to Coney Island to look at what she called ''the fuzzies'' -- the stuffed animals -- the official said.</p>
        <p>Another law enforcement official said Ms. Arroyo refused to explain why she had left her daughter and ''showed no remorse'' for having done so.</p>
        <p>A neighbor of Ms. Arroyo's on the ninth floor of 953 DeKalb Avenue, Vona Smith, said she was approached in front of the building yesterday by two men dressed as maintenance workers, who showed her a photo of Crystal.</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith, 20, said she told them the girl lived down the hall from her and led them upstairs.</p>
        <p>The men knocked on Ms. Arroyo's door for 20 minutes, Ms. Smith said. Finally, they took apart the lock and forced their way in, finding Ms. Arroyo inside, she said.</p>
        <p>Before the men had a chance to ask her anything, Ms. Arroyo began to scream, ''That ain't my baby! That ain't my baby!'' Ms. Smith said.</p>
        <p>But the police found a photo of Crystal in the apartment, said Deputy Inspector Robert Wheeler III of the Brooklyn detectives. Crystal is in the custody of the City Administration for Children's Services, the inspector said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Arroyo has three other children, 12, 15 and 20, none of whom live  with her, said Jennifer Falk, a spokeswoman for the agency. A complaint filed last year accused Ms. Arroyo of neglecting Crystal, but it was not substantiated, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith said she first met Ms. Arroyo about a month ago, when Ms. Arroyo, who had just moved in, was screaming at Crystal in an elevator to be quiet.</p>
        <p>A third law enforcement official said Ms. Arroyo had been in treatment for drug and alcohol abuse.</p>
        <p>Inside Ms. Arroyo's one-bedroom apartment, dishes sat on the floor in the kitchen, and the bedroom held only an empty bed frame. Stuffed animals lay everywhere.</p>
