        <p>Verizon Communications and a union representing more than 35,000 employees in several mid-Atlantic states settled an 18-day strike last night after the company agreed to reduce requirements for mandatory overtime.</p>
        <p>The agreement came after nearly all significant differences between Verizon and two unions were resolved and a majority of strikers returned to work earlier this week in New York and New England.</p>
        <p>An agreement in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and Washington was held up over the overtime issue, in addition to local concerns like what type of work cable splicers and service technicians can do in Pennsylvania, people close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement reached last night between Verizon, which was formed by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, and the Communications Workers of America, customer service representatives in these states will be required to work as much as 7.5 hours of overtime a week, down from as much as 15 hours. Other union employees' overtime will be capped at 10 hours a week after the contract is ratified, and 8 hours in January.</p>
        <p>In addition to the overtime concession, Verizon agreed to a bilingual salary differential, in which workers who do jobs that require more than one language will receive 3.5 percent more pay, people close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>Over all, the communications workers' union and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which together represented more than 86,000 employees in the walkout, secured a wide range of concessions from Verizon, including wage and benefit increases, stock options, greater job security and more flexibility to organize in the company's fast-growing wireless division.</p>
        <p>While union negotiators in New York and New England considered these concessions a pivotal victory in their effort to gain a foothold in high-technology industries, their counterparts in the mid-Atlantic region wrangled over local issues like cable splicers. Verizon apparently wanted to deploy cable splicers with greater flexibility. A definitive agreement on this issue was not reached, people close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>Cable splicers generally install and repair telephone cables and are considered more skilled than service technicians, who connect and repair telephone service on the outside of homes and businesses.</p>
        <p>''We're happy to put this strike in the past,'' said Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon.</p>
