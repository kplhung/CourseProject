        <p>The owner of an Internet cafe in southern China has been arrested and charged with subversion for posting articles critical of the Communist Party, the latest sign of the government's campaign to tame the explosion of electronic information.</p>
        <p>Jiang Shihua, a high school teacher who operated the cafe in the city of Nanchong in Sichuan Province, is the third person in recent months known to face serious charges for political statements on the Internet. His arrest on Aug. 16, five days after he began posting the articles under a pseudonym, was reported this week by the Free China Movement in Washington, based on Chinese television accounts and by Reporters Without Borders, a media watchdog group in Paris.</p>

        <p>China's leaders have embraced the Internet as a key to development but also fear it, and special ''Web police'' units have been formed to search for illegal activities including fraud and pornography as well as outlawed political debate.</p>
        <p>This month, the authorities shut down New Culture Forum, a Web site in Shandong Province that sponsored lively debate.</p>
