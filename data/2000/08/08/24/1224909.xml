        <p>Tropical Storm Debby lost momentum today as it spun westward through the rough mountains of the island of Hispaniola and headed toward the northern coast of Cuba, where the storm was expected to weaken even more before threatening the Florida coast or moving into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
        <p>South Floridians, who have tensely followed the storm, the first hurricane to threaten the coast this season, were relieved this morning when the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm, but forecasters here warned that the state was still in danger.</p>
        <p>Winds had slipped to below 60 miles per hour by this evening as the storm moved across the Dominican Republic and then Haiti, bringing heavy rain and tearing the tin roofs off homes.</p>
        <p>''The mountains of Hispaniola have really disrupted the circulation,'' said Max Mayfield, the director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ''Not only has it not strengthened, it has weakened and will likely continue to weaken as the center moves up onto Cuba.''</p>
        <p>The hurricane is already looking ragged -- a tight spiral of clouds denotes a stronger, more dangerous storm -- as it seems headed, forecasters tentatively predicted, for the Florida Straits and then into the gulf. That would carry it over or close to the Florida Keys, where emergency management officials today ordered an evacuation of tourists, a move that they hoped would open up the roads for Keys residents if they were ordered to leave later this week.</p>
        <p>''We're just asking residents right now to put their hurricane plans into effect,'' said Becky Herrin, a spokeswoman for the Monroe County Emergency Operations Center.</p>
        <p>The worst thing that could happen, the state's emergency management officials said, is for people fleeing the coast to be trapped in traffic as a storm bears down.</p>
        <p>Keys residents, accustomed to such things, covered windows with plywood, stocked up on water and flashlight batteries, and watched their televisions for the latest weather updates. But, as the storm weakened, some residents relaxed, let their dogs out for a run on the unusually quiet streets and waited.</p>
        <p>In the usually boisterous bars on Duval Street in Key West, people who rely on the tourists for their living said they definitely were not better off alone.</p>
        <p>''It's dead, for us,'' said Kathy Wolfort, a bartender and waitress at Sloppy Joe's. ''Usually right now, our whole dining room is full.''</p>
        <p>Of the 65 tables in the restaurant, only 15 were being used.</p>
        <p>Forecasters warned that the good news about the storm might not last and that the storm could strengthen after returning to open water, perhaps in the straits or the gulf. It could threaten the west coast of Florida, the Panhandle or other areas in the gulf, they said.</p>
        <p>The storm skirted Puerto Rico, causing only minor damage there and in the United States Virgin Islands.</p>
        <p>In Miami, some residents went to buy plywood and other emergency supplies, but the threat, at least for the city and surrounding area, seemed to have evaporated.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't look to us like there is any chance this will become a hurricane, at least in the short term,'' Mr. Mayfield of the hurricane center said.</p>
        <p>But, he added, ''we don't want to let our guard down.''</p>
        <p>If the storm does head into the warm waters of the gulf, it could pick up strength and threaten the Gulf Coast, Mr. Mayfield said.</p>
        <p>Hurricane Frederick in 1979 did just that, he said. It was a ragged storm, too, but became a dangerous hurricane as it swept across the gulf to the Alabama coast.</p>
        <p>Even if winds do not create much damage, the current storm is expected to bring torrential rains, wherever it makes landfall.</p>
