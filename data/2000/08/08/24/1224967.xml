        <p>Gov. George W. Bush was supposed to be spending this week focusing on education, the issue with which his campaign is wooing women and independent voters.</p>
        <p>But in recent days on the trail, he instead found himself reaching for big numbers and defending his proposed tax cut in a manner that came across as reactive and not entirely coherent.</p>
        <p>In that, and other ways, the brief period after the Democratic National Convention has not been entirely flattering to the Republican nominee.</p>
        <p>After Vice President Al Gore's fiery pledge at the convention on Thursday night to fight long and hard for the presidency and the people he wanted to serve, Mr. Bush had his chance to reclaim the spotlight.</p>
        <p>But on Friday, his one public event was over by midafternoon, and the high point on his remaining schedule was a run along one of his favorite routes in Dallas. On Monday, after a day at home, he told reporters that one of the pleasures of his break was taking a nap.</p>
        <p>In addition, he added, ''Went to bed relatively early.''</p>
        <p>While this sort of thing represents a mere snapshot in time -- and comes in the two weeks before Labor Day, not the two weeks before Election Day -- it has exposed some of the Texas governor's weaknesses and quirks at a juncture when small impressions can sometimes take on big significance as the attention to both candidates intensifies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's advisers said today that they were not concerned.</p>
        <p>One of them acknowledged that the Texas governor's largely unprompted defense of his sweeping tax cut proposal this week, coupled with the admission he made that he needed to do a better job of pitching it, had thrown the campaign off its chosen message.</p>
        <p>But the adviser said the campaign would be back on track later this week, with new education proposals on Thursday and a new speech on international relations on Friday.</p>
        <p>''Things like this happen,'' the adviser said. ''It's overblown.''</p>
        <p>The adviser and others said they had always expected the rise in Mr. Gore's poll numbers and that the news media's spotlight on anything and everything that looks like a sign of trouble in Mr. Bush's campaign was an equally predictable part of the ever-shifting dynamics of the race.</p>
        <p>But that equanimity itself raised questions.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush's advisers have taken great pains recently to talk about how many states he planned to visit in late August, a preliminary schedule for the next week and a half showed Mr. Bush taking three days off of the campaign trail over the weekend, traveling just three days next week and then taking three days off the trail before Labor Day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush himself makes frequent comments about resting and sleeping and a sensible pace, concerns that do not exactly portray him as a ball of fire. His advisers sought to frame this as an advantage, saying it casts him as a sensible man not utterly consumed by politics.</p>
        <p>''Gore runs the risk of looking like he's just an absolute, total political animal,'' one adviser said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's acknowledgment that he had to sell his suggested tax cut more strongly than he has pointed to a different problem: that a proposal that resonated with the Republican base in the primaries could give pause to swing voters in the general election. Many polls suggest that tax cuts are low on a majority of voters' wish lists.</p>
        <p>Although there was discussion in Mr. Bush's campaign before he made that proposal last year about whether the cost of it -- $1.6 trillion over nine years -- was too large, Mr. Bush has promoted his plan as a matter of unswerving principle and economic justice, and both he and his advisers said he would not retreat from it.</p>
        <p>But some Democratic pollsters said that their research indicates that voters, while happy to have some tax cuts, particularly for middle-class Americans, worry about the effect of a large, broad one on Social Security, Medicare and the economy in general.</p>
        <p>''Bush has walked into a significant trap of his own making on this,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.</p>
        <p>And one Republican strategist in Washington who sometimes advises the Bush campaign conceded, ''What's Bush going to do? No matter how hard he pushes his tax plan, it doesn't seem to catch fire.''</p>
        <p>Several other Republican strategists and pollsters said that a basic appetite among Americans for tax cuts was obvious in the fact that Mr. Gore has offered a proposal that would cost $620 billion over 10 years, and that Mr. Bush simply needed to push his plan in more deliberate ways.</p>
        <p>During long stretches of time on the stump, especially recently, he has often cast it in broad, ideological terms. John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster, said that Mr. Bush ''has got to sell this as a kitchen-table, pocketbook issue: This is what it means to you.''</p>
        <p>Interestingly, Mr. Bush's unprompted defense of his tax cut this week was an effort to explain how spending and surplus projections over the next week enabled him to accomplish his proposals.</p>
        <p>But he stumbled over his numbers in a speech on Monday night and then, when he revisited the topic with reporters on his campaign plane the next day, went through the issue so quickly and elliptically that aides had to come back to provide more detail on his arithmetic, which turned out to be well in line with estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.</p>
        <p>And that underscored a potentially larger concern for the Texas governor, one that has been on intermittent display since the Democrats' convention: when he departs from the scripted eloquence of a stump speech (and, sometimes, when he mangles the words within it), he can seem fuzzy on specifics, less than forceful in his thinking, tired.</p>
        <p>''The minute he tries to get deep into the weeds, a la Al Gore, who's excellent there, it runs counter to his personality,'' an adviser acknowledged.</p>
