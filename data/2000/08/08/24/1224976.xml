        <p>Two out of every three New York City students who showed up for summer school will be promoted to the next grade, even though only about 40 percent of those who took the end-of-summer reading and mathematics tests passed them, Board of Education officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The board officials expressed satisfaction with the results and contended that the proportion of summer-school students who will be promoted was a significant improvement over the results of last year's program. But that claim was complicated by changes in testing and promotion policy that made comparisons with last year's summer program difficult. For example, the failure rate on the tests this summer was actually higher than last summer's. But board officials said that the failure rate increased  because a new, more challenging test was used and students needed a higher score to pass.</p>
        <p>The results yesterday are being closely watched partly because Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy had staked his reputation on a successful summer program that strengthened the board's new determination not to promote students automatically. He devoted much of his time in his first months as chancellor to planning the program and ensuring that schools had enough resources to make it work.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levy was on vacation in Maine when the results were announced at yesterday's Board of Education meeting, and one board member complained bitterly about his absence. ''September is right around the corner,'' said Ninfa Segarra, one of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's appointees to the board and someone who had originally opposed Mr. Levy's appointment. ''He really should have been present.''</p>
        <p>Further complicating interpretation of the results was the fact that 12.1 percent of the 62,537 students who were mandated to attend summer school did not enroll. Although that attendance rate is much higher than last year's, it still means that roughly 7,500 children will be held back automatically because they skipped summer school. That brings the total number of students who will be held back in grades three through eight to 20,408.</p>
        <p>Of the 42,383 students who took the end-of-summer tests this month, 41 percent passed in reading and 37.3 percent passed in math, board officials said. Yet 39,652 students -- about 63 percent of the 62,537 in grades three through eight who were mandated to attend summer school -- will be promoted.</p>
        <p>The reason: under the promotion policy the board adopted last year, students could be promoted even if they failed the end-of-summer tests, as long as their teachers judged them ready. The students were evaluated not only on their test scores, but also on their classwork and attendance.</p>
        <p>Last year, in comparison, the end-of-summer tests were the only criteria used to determine whether students were promoted. But there were several loopholes. Students who had already been held back more than twice were automatically promoted regardless of their scores, for example, as were eighth-grade students who were older than 15.</p>
        <p>As a result, 66.8 percent of the students mandated to attend summer school in 1999 were promoted, even though only 57.3 percent passed the reading and math tests.</p>
        <p>The $300 million program was started last year after years of pressure from Mayor Giuliani to end the practice of social promotion -- the automatic advancement of children to the next grade even if they are failing -- and is part of a trend sweeping urban school districts across the nation. But last summer's program was far smaller, with only students who had failed grades three, six or eight required to attend.</p>
        <p>That program ended in chaos when board officials discovered that 8,800 of the 35,344 students mandated to attend never showed up, and that 8,600 others had been assigned by mistake.</p>
        <p>The failure figured into the board's decision to fire Rudy Crew, who had been chancellor since 1995. When the board hired Mr. Levy in January, he promised to make summer school a top priority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy kept track of daily attendance by having superintendents enter their figures into a Web site every day. He also tried to increase attendance rates by mailing letters to the parents of students in danger of failing, starting in January. After the five-week program began on July 5, attendance teachers called and even visited students' homes to encourage them to show up.</p>
        <p>But attendance proved problematic again this year: of the 62,357 students in grades three through eight who were required to attend summer school, 6,175 were withdrawn from the program by their parents. An additional 1,366 students never showed up. Although 87.9 percent of the mandated students enrolled in summer school, daily attendance hovered around 78 percent, board officials said.</p>
        <p>At the high school level, only about 50 percent of the students who were supposed to attend summer school did so. But unlike younger students, they were not in danger of being automatically held back if they skipped the program.</p>
        <p>Board officials said their hands were tied because under the current law, the city cannot force children to attend summer school, no matter how poor their performance. Mr. Levy has urged the State Legislature to make summer school compulsory for failing students.</p>
        <p>Despite the attendance problems and the large number of students who failed the end-of-summer tests, board officials called the program a success yesterday. Both Ms. Segarra and William C. Thompson Jr., the board president, defended the policy of promoting some students even if they failed the tests, saying their teachers knew them well enough to decide whether they were ready to move on.</p>
        <p>''We are deferring to them as professionals and saying, 'Use your expertise to let us know if we should let this child proceed,' '' Ms. Segarra said. ''Not every child is good at standardized testing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson stressed that the tests were tougher this year, and that the minimum passing scores were higher.</p>
        <p>''This was rigorous, this was tough, and the one thing that was impressive was the percentage of students that are promoted, particularly when they have to compete against higher standards,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''The numbers are better than we hoped for.''</p>
