      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Maytag repairman may be getting a new boss.</p>
        <p>Maytag, the appliance maker based in Newton, Iowa, is negotiating to be acquired by Electrolux, the Swedish maker of Frigidaire refrigerators and other household products, for close to $4 billion, according to executives close to the company.</p>
        <p>The executives cautioned that a deal, which would create the world's largest maker of ovens, dishwashers and washing machines, is not imminent and that several other rivals have recently made their own informal overtures to Maytag about a possible combination.</p>
        <p>Takeover talks have been fueled by a change in the Maytag Corporation's bylaws in May that make it easier to acquire the company.</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts say the combination would create a strong rival to the Whirlpool Corporation, the largest appliance maker in North America, and General Electric. It is not known whether those companies have talked to Maytag about a deal.</p>
        <p>Maytag and Electrolux could be a powerful combination, analysts contend, because Maytag, which had worldwide sales of $4.3 billion in 1999, has a powerful United States brand that has been strengthened in recent years by an array of innovative, higher-priced products, like Blodgett commercial ovens and Neptune washing machines.</p>
        <p>Electrolux, which makes everything from farm tractors to ovens, dishwashers and vacuum cleaners, is a major force in Europe. The company had global sales of about $14.6 billion in 1999, and could give Maytag the global reach it needs to sell its models abroad.</p>
        <p>Rumors have been swirling about a possible Electrolux-Maytag deal for weeks, after newspaper reports that Electrolux executives toured Maytag's plants as early as June.</p>
        <p>The speculation sent shares of Maytag up $2.88 on Tuesday, to $38.13, on volume of 1.5 million compared with average daily volume of 528,141. The stock's volatility and volume simmered down yesterday. Maytag closed at $37.31, down 81 cents. The American depository receipts of Electrolux fell 44 cents yesterday, to $27.50.</p>
        <p>Thomas Schwartz, a spokesman for Maytag, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Elecrolux could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>People close to Maytag say that talks between Maytag and Electrolux have been going on for months and may have been held up over price. Shares of Maytag, which were as high as $74 a share on July 14, 1999, fell as low as $27 earlier this month because of concerns that growth at the company had begun to slow late last year.</p>
        <p>After several years of spectacular growth, Maytag executives attributed the profit slowdown to weakness in its lower-priced products as well as trouble in its Dixie-Narco vending machines division.</p>
        <p>Trying to ease concerns, Lloyd D. Ward, the chief executive at Maytag, announced plans last September to reorganize the company's operations to cut more than $100 million in costs over the next few years.</p>
        <p>He also said Maytag would move aggressively into electronic commerce, that it would work to create smart appliances that could some day be connected to the Internet, and  that new strategies were aimed at selling more products into the international markets.</p>
        <p>Part of Maytag's problem, though, was strong competition from Whirlpool, which has about 35 percent of the North American market, and GE Appliances, with about 27 percent.</p>
        <p>Indeed, analysts say that the success of GE Appliances in selling its products over the Internet and shipping the products faster to market has shaken up the industry and put increased pressure on Whirlpool and Maytag.</p>
        <p>That such a deal with Electrolux is in the works has also created a buzz in Iowa's newspapers, which have been reporting for weeks about a possible Electrolux deal and the possibility that Maytag would move its headquarters to Chicago.</p>
        <p>People close to Maytag say that any plans to move to Chicago have been put on hold because of negotiations with Electrolux. They also say that after heavy trading in Maytag shares last year, insider trading among top executives has dried up recently, a hint that executives are restraining from trading because a merger deal is in the works.</p>
