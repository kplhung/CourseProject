      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Immediately, Liz Shipman, the director, gets the emotional center of ''A Midsommer Nights Dreame'' right. In this production by the Kings County Shakespeare Company, no matter what happens in the Athenian court or in the more imposing fairy court of Oberon and Titania, no matter how much amusing confusion Puck produces with his botched enchantments, and no matter how diverting Bottom and his mechanicals contrive to be, the play revolves around the rivalry between Hermia and Helena over which of them will end up with Demetrius and which with Lysander.</p>
        <p>Their contest is not some trick of the sprites; it is real. Ms. Shipman, one of the two artistic directors of the company, rightly hangs the whole plot from it, and Sherri Pullum, as Hermia, and Renee Bucciarelli, as Helena, give it fiery energy. There is no pretense in their lifelong friendship at the outset, but this Hermia, once she gets the upper hand at court, knows how to let her eyes gloat even when her mouth is deferential. When the two get out into the woods at night, however, pursuing their men, Helena's wounded emotions turn into the armor of a triumphant fury who can transform a perfectly innocent remark into a shattering taunt.</p>

        <p>Immediately, Liz Shipman, the director, gets the emotional center of ''A Midsommer Nights Dreame'' right. In this production by the Kings County Shakespeare Company, no matter what happens in the Athenian court or in the more imposing fairy court of Oberon and Titania, no matter how much amusing confusion Puck produces with his botched enchantments, and no matter how diverting Bottom and his mechanicals contrive to be, the play revolves around the rivalry between Hermia and Helena over which of them will end up with Demetrius and which with Lysander.</p>
        <p>Their contest is not some trick of the sprites; it is real. Ms. Shipman, one of the two artistic directors of the company, rightly hangs the whole plot from it, and Sherri Pullum, as Hermia, and Renee Bucciarelli, as Helena, give it fiery energy. There is no pretense in their lifelong friendship at the outset, but this Hermia, once she gets the upper hand at court, knows how to let her eyes gloat even when her mouth is deferential. When the two get out into the woods at night, however, pursuing their men, Helena's wounded emotions turn into the armor of a triumphant fury who can transform a perfectly innocent remark into a shattering taunt.</p>
        <p>What goes on between them is almost hand-to-hand combat, but there is so much good humor between the actresses that you have to admire their blows and share the astonishment of Demetrius (Andrew Oswald) and Lysander (Cyrus Farmer) at their wit, ingenuity and terrific willpower. Watching the battle between these women is great pleasure, and enlightening.</p>
        <p>The play, whose title has been spelled to conform to the First Folio text, with which Ms. Shipman is playing a few tricks of her own, is on a double bill this year with ''The Rivals,'' by Richard Brinsley Sheridan. A double bill is possible for the first time in the 17-year history of this company's summer festival because it is being presented for the second year in Founders Hall of St. Francis College in downtown Brooklyn. The festival moved there at the last minute in 1999 when renovations to the Prospect Park Band Shell, where it had played for many years, ran late. The band-shell stage would not support two plays in repertory. But this year the company has built a stage at the front of Founders Hall, with professional lighting, and has taken on a look you suspect it intends to keep.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the game of wits in the court of Oberon and Titania, Ms. Shipman is not so sure-footed. Jon Fordham's Oberon is an attractively laid-back character who can afford to look indolent because his control is sure. Titania, as created by the company's other artistic director, Deborah Wright Houston, is properly imperious, and her drugged enchantment seems amusing and slightly embarrassing at the same time. And Puck (Andrew Stewart-Jones) is distinctly diabolical and a good deal sassier to Oberon than most Pucks.</p>
        <p>The problem lies with the seven fairies; they sound like yipping prairie dogs much of the time and act like unruly children. Their songs, especially, strike you as juvenile, and that suggests that the conception itself is off cue. After all, Puck's famous assertion that it is only the mortals who are fools speaks for the whole fairy tribe, and a large part of this tribe is indistinguishable, in spirit, from the confused mortals lost in the dark woods.</p>
        <p>Finally, the presentation of ''Pyramus and Thisbe,'' the show at the end by the mechanicals, is so drawn out that the audience gets visibly restive. The director has thrown in a couple of innovations that make it knowingly bawdy, which is jarring; when the workmen lose their innocence, they tend to lose their audience. This is a pity, since John Flaherty's Bottom is an inspired creation who in the woods with Titania produces a marvelous donkey sound when he laughs (a neigh exquisitely mimicked by Puck) and who, as Pyramus, is a fine frazzled fussbudget. And John McCarthy as Flute taking the role of Thisbe has an almost musical instinct about how to make intonation change the most ordinary words into little explosions of laughter.</p>
        <p>I suspect that the tedium of this closing scene, which spreads into the audience, has to do with Ms. Shipman's desire to produce indoors some of the robust audience response that was such a vital part of the company's shows in the band shell. It is worth the effort, because viewers who bring their own rambunctiousness with them to an outdoor setting do have to be prodded to let loose inside an auditorium. But there are many ways to create a festive atmosphere in theater, and this company's history suggests that it will find the right one in time. After all, it knows everything else about how to share its sense of fun with its audience.</p>
