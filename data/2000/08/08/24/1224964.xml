        <p>The Massachusetts State Ethics Commission found today that Lt. Gov. Jane Swift, who won her office in 1998 less than three weeks after bearing her first child, violated ethics rules by having two aides baby-sit away from the State House.</p>
        <p>But the panel cleared Ms. Swift on several other ethics charges including improperly using a state helicopter to fly home to her sick baby and using aides to help her move her household.</p>
        <p>''I've made some mistakes and I'm very sorry for those mistakes, and I have a lot of work ahead of me if, as I hope, I am to regain the trust of the public,'' Ms. Swift said tonight on WBZ radio.</p>
        <p>''I've learned from these mistakes,'' she said. ''One of the things I've learned is that I have difficulty publicly admitting mistakes.''</p>
        <p>She said she would not appeal. The commission has the power to fine or reprimand her.</p>
        <p>The commission's finding capped months of drubbing that Ms. Swift, a Republican, has been taking here in Democrat-dominated political circles, in the news and in coffee-counter talk. Her decision to run for office while pregnant in 1998 made her a heroine to some working women, a model of how women could do it all. But her questionable use of the perks of office to help balance motherhood with work -- and her defensive attitude when challenged -- prompted anger from many supporters and scorn from opponents.</p>
        <p>Michael Goldman, a Democratic political consultant, even printed up buttons reading, ''Jane 'not so' Swift: It Takes an Entire State Government to Raise a Child.''</p>
        <p>The attacks on Ms. Swift have been further energized by widespread talk that the governor, Paul Cellucci, might take a federal job if the next president is a Republican, in which case Ms. Swift would become governor.</p>
        <p>But there seems to be even more at work in Ms. Swift's case, said Elizabeth A. Sherman, director of the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.</p>
        <p>''On the one hand, we have to say that she is new to this high level, she made some mistakes and, unfortunately, she suffered a tremendous amount of vilification in the press and the court of public opinion for it,'' Dr. Sherman said. ''That said, I also feel that it's just been an extraordinary backlash against her.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Swift's troubles began in January when local newspapers reported that she had relied on aides for personal services including caring for her toddler daughter both in the State House and at home, helping her move and picking up dry cleaning.  They also disclosed that she had used a state helicopter to avoid Thanksgiving traffic and fly home to her sick daughter in western Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>State ethics rules bar officials from asking employees to attend to their personal chores, because the workers could feel pressure to obey. At first, in what many see as her biggest mistake, Ms. Swift defended her actions, saying that she shared many of the problems of everyday working parents but that her schedule was unusually demanding.</p>
        <p>When she was queried about aides' complaints that they felt pressured into baby-sitting for Elizabeth, she replied, ''I would be stunned if there was anyone who was feeling pressure to spend time with her and care for her.'' In fact, she said, staff members were happy to spend time with the baby, ''She is adorable and engaging and she's learned to blow kisses.''</p>
        <p>Her remarks alienated many working parents, and some pointed out that Ms. Swift has a stay-at-home husband, a flexible job and a supportive superior in Governor Cellucci -- and yet she still needed to call on aides to help ''hold it all together.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Swift, 35, soon apologized, and apologized again, saying she was still learning about being a mother and a lieutenant governor. She asked for the ethics commission to examine her actions to see if they violated state ethics rules. On Monday, and again tonight, Ms. Swift said she was sorry that questions about her ethics had drawn attention away from her administration's political agenda.</p>
        <p>But her apologies did not stop a precipitous slide in her popularity: she and Governor Cellucci were elected with 51 percent of the vote; a poll by The Boston Globe in February found that only 20 percent of respondents viewed Ms. Swift favorably, while 36 percent saw her unfavorably.</p>
        <p>In the bigger picture, said Dr. Sherman of the University of Massachusetts, Ms. Swift's story is a case study of how women in politics are perceived, and may also have a ''chilling effect'' on young women who consider entering politics by showing them the microscopic examination their behavior, including their mothering, must endure.</p>
        <p>But, she said, the worst part of the baby scandal may be that it became a missed opportunity -- Ms. Swift could have used it to ask what resources are needed to help parents mix work and child rearing.</p>
        <p>''That is a question that needed to be asked and answered, and it's just hanging out there,'' Dr. Sherman  said. She said Ms. Swift ''had the opportunity to move that discussion forward, and she didn't, because she felt embattled, besieged, defensive.''</p>
