        <p>The National Institutes of Health yesterday issued long-awaited rules that would permit federally financed researchers to work on human embryonic stem cells, cells derived from the very early embryo.</p>
        <p>Because of these cells' ability to form every tissue of the body, scientists say they hold great promise in treating many diseases, particularly the degenerative maladies of age.</p>
        <p>The rules would permit federally financed researchers to use cell lines that were derived from frozen human embryos due to be discarded by fertility clinics, usually because the owners no longer wanted them.</p>
        <p>Opponents of abortion have objected to federal approval of such research because the embryos, which they consider to be capable of life, are destroyed in the process.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to sidestep the abortion issue, the National Institutes of Health would allow its researchers to use only cells that were obtained by private firms. The agency's researchers themselves would not be allowed to extract the cells from discarded embryos.</p>
        <p>The cells, which were first cultured two years ago, may legally be derived by anyone who does not receive federal financing. Human embryos are created by mixing eggs and sperm in fertility clinics.</p>
        <p>The decision was welcomed by scientific groups like the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, in a press conference yesterday, referred to the ''potentially staggering benefits of this research.''</p>
        <p>''I think we cannot walk away from the potential to save lives and improve lives, to help people literally get up and walk, to do all kinds of things we could never have imagined,'' the president said, ''as long as we meet rigorous, ethical standards.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lana Skirboll, director of science policy at the National Institutes of Health, said that the agency's special review committee for embryonic stem cells would hold its first meeting next month and that the first research grants could be awarded before the end of next year.</p>
        <p>Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, the Senate's leading critic of the agency's policy, said in a statement yesterday that human embryonic stem cell research was ''illegal, immoral and unnecessary.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brownback said the research was prohibited by a Congressional ban on financing research that led to the destruction of human embryos, that sought to benefit by taking human life and that would lead to treatments that can be developed by other means: the use of adult stem cells.</p>
        <p>The initial draft of the agency's guidelines, issued last December, drew criticism as morally inconsistent from anti-abortion groups and even the National Bioethics Advisory Commission.</p>
        <p>In their final form, the guidelines have been made more stringent, by addition of a new level of review. Biologists seeking federal money to work on human embryonic stem cells will have to win approval from four separate bodies -- their university's in-house review group, and three panels within the N.I.H. --- before receiving their money.</p>
        <p>The guidelines include several provisions designed to discourage anyone from donating embryos for profit or the medical benefit of relatives. The new version also allows the donor of the embryonic cells to be identified, since the immunological make-up of the cells may be important if they are transplanted into patients.</p>
        <p>The extra reviews required by the new rules should not delay research because they will take place within the agency's normal reviewing cycle, Dr. Skirboll said.</p>
        <p>One new issue that has been raised in recent months comes from the finding that a different kind of stem cells found in the organs of adults are far more versatile than supposed. The opponents of financing embryonic stem cells have argued that the promised health benefits could be obtained just as well as from a patient's own adult stem cells.</p>
        <p>The argument is not without substance. Most organs seem to have a small reservoir of stem cells that generate new cells, such as the bone marrow stem cells that daily replenish the red and white blood cells.  Adult stem cells are less versatile than embryonic stem cells but they now appear to be less tissue-specific than thought; recent experiments have shown that the blood-making stem cells can also be coaxed to make muscle cells and even nerve cells.</p>
        <p>Blood-making stem cells are quite accessible and could perhaps be converted into dopamine-secreting brain cells, the type lost in Parkinson's disease. Use of a patient's own stem cells would avoid both the ethical problems of embryonic stem cells and the threat of immunological rejection.</p>
        <p>But embryonic stem cells grow much more prolifically than adult stem cells and biologists have in mind several ways of handling the problem of immune rejection. In short, no one yet knows which type of stem cell will prove more suitable for clinical use, and researchers would like to try both.</p>
        <p>Embryonic stem cells are taken from the embryo at a stage when it is a hollow sphere consisting of a thousand or so cells. Inside the sphere is a blob known as the inner cell mass which contains the stem cells. The cells can form any tissue of the body except the placenta.</p>
        <p>Last week a scientific committee recommended to the British government that researchers should be allowed to embark on therapeutic cloning, in which an ordinary body cell is taken from a patient and inserted into a human egg cell whose own nucleus has been removed.</p>
        <p>In principle the inserted nucleus can then direct the egg to grow into an entire adult organism. This is the process that was used to clone Dolly the sheep, the nucleus being taken from an adult mammary gland cell.</p>
        <p>A human egg cell with an introduced adult cell nucleus would presumably be a viable embryo, but inserting it into a uterus would be a criminal offense in Britain. For therapeutic cloning, the egg would instead be cultured in laboratory glassware and exposed to signals that would convert it into the type of tissue that the patient needed to have replaced. The concept has been demonstrated in repairing heart tissue in mice and is considered to have enormous clinical promise.</p>
        <p>In the United States therapeutic cloning could legally be undertaken by private researchers but no one is known to have done so, Dr. Skirboll said.</p>
        <p>Therapeutic cloning is specifically prohibited for federally financed researchers by the guideliness issued today.</p>
