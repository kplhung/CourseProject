        <p>Lisa Raymond's bid to replace Serena Williams on the United States Olympic team was turned down today, but the decision by the arbitrator, Richard Jeydel, did not leave the United States Tennis Association unscathed.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Raymond's lawyers argued in Manhattan that she had earned a right to be on the four-woman American team because she was the No. 1-ranked doubles player in the world. In the past, the U.S.T.A. has selected the top doubles player to be the fourth person on the team.</p>
        <p>But in early August, Coach Billie Jean King selected the top four American singles players: Lindsay Davenport, Venus Williams, Monica Seles and Serena Williams. The selection criteria the U.S.T.A. submitted to the United States Olympic Committee did not distinguish between singles and doubles rankings. Raymond believed that precedent would clear up the ambiguity, and her lawyers cited Gigi Fernandez's appointment to the team in 1992 and 1996.</p>
        <p>''You don't fight your butt off to be the No. 1-ranked doubles player in the world and not get chosen to go to the Olympic Games,'' a weary Raymond said today before her rain-delayed match at the Pilot Pen tournament. ''How that's not good enough, you tell me.''</p>
        <p>In his decision, Jeydel found that in a letter sent to eligible players on March 13, they were not clearly informed of the selection procedure. As a result, Jeydel wrote, Raymond was ''misled by the U.S.T.A.'s untimely and ill-considered communication.'' Jeydel also added that King was misinformed as to the procedure and that the U.S.T.A. knowingly allowed her to make public and inaccurate statements on the subject to stand uncorrected. On July 6, the U.S.T.A., Jeydel wrote, compounded its error by providing King with selection instructions for the team that gave her discretionary power that departed from U.S.O.C. procedure.</p>
        <p>Still, Jeydel decided against Raymond, and reasoned, ''As it happened, Ms. King and the U.S.T.A. designated the four top ranked U.S. players for the team in accordance with the letter, if not the spirit, of the procedures.'' Therefore, Jeydel allowed Serena Williams's selection to the team to stand.</p>
        <p>''We regret any misinformation that may have led to confusion,'' Rick Ferman, the U.S.TA. executive director, said in a statement.</p>
