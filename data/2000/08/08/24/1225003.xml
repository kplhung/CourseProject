        <p>Letter from New York City Councilman Kenneth K Fisher on Aug 10 article on dangers posed by laser pointers in some teenagers' backpacks</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While laser pointers may be in some teenagers' backpacks, they are not just a nuisance. They are potentially dangerous, so much so that unauthorized possession by someone under the age of 19 was made illegal in New York City in December 1998. One reason for that action is that police officers are trained to respond to being ''dotted'' with a laser pointer as if they are in the sights of a weapon and to respond accordingly. Young people should be discouraged from treating laser pointers as fashion accessories or high-tech toys.</p>
        <p>KENNETH K. FISHER  Member, City Council, 33rd Dist.  Brooklyn</p>
        <p>The writer is chairman of the council's youth services committee.</p>
