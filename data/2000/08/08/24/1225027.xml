        <p>Incyte Genomics said that Randy Scott, its president and chief scientific officer, will leave day-to-day operations to start an e-health company that is expected to be affiliated with Incyte. Dr. Scott, a co-founder of Incyte, will become its chairman, replacing Jeff Collinson, the original investor in the company. Roy A. Whitfield remains chief executive of Incyte, which sells genomics information and is based in Palo Alto, Calif. Dr. Scott said his new Internet company would provide patients with updated information on research into diseases, including genetic information, and might do testing of genes for patients. The new company, as yet unnamed, is expected to get an investment from Incyte and to use its genomics information. Incyte's shares fell $6.88, to $80.63.</p>
