        <p>''Are you trying to say I'm stupid?'' Jason Fabini said to Jumbo Elliott, his former mentor who is now his backup.</p>
        <p>''No, it's just that I've got an I.Q. of 140,'' Elliott said today before downing a handful of protein powder. Then, he added, ''And went to the University of Michigan.''</p>
        <p>So it goes for the Jets' two left tackles -- on the field, at each other's homes, at concerts, at their adjacent lockers. A mutual respect with some barbs at the edge.</p>
        <p>Fabini, who will be 26 on Friday, is now the starter. But he is returning from knee surgery. Elliott, who is 35, retired last March, underwent back surgery and is trying a comeback.</p>
        <p>Their left tackle spot offers the primary protection for quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who is returning from Achilles' tendon surgery. It is a critical threesome, because Elliott would return to left tackle if anything happened to Fabini or if Fabini had to shift back to right tackle, his old position.</p>
        <p>In this roundabout tale, Fabini became the left tackle in Game 9 last year, a Monday night affair at New England, because Elliott's chronically sore back was causing too much pain. But Fabini never finished the game, suffering serious ligament damage in his knee, which ended his season.</p>
        <p>Elliott has been in for a dozen preseason plays since he returned to the Jets, all in the final exhibition game against the Giants last Friday. Fabini has played considerably over the summer. Both have been part of an extraordinarily efficient offensive line that was beaten for only six sacks while Jets quarterbacks threw 129 passes during four exhibition games.</p>
        <p>When the season starts at Green Bay on Sept. 3, Fabini will be wearing a supporting knee brace. ''I'll have it all year,'' he said. But for now, the injury does not appear to be a problem. Neither is Fabini's shift from right to left tackle.</p>
        <p>He was an instant starter at right tackle as a rookie in 1998, even though he was not drafted until the fourth round after a collegiate career at Cincinnati. In the scouting combines, he had been molasses-slow and his draft rating plummeted.</p>
        <p>''I think Jason is a football player,'' Elliott said. ''He probably could have been drafted a lot higher. But people forget we play football, instead of running around in shorts at the scouting combine.''</p>
        <p>The football player in the unheralded Fabini attracted Elliott, who was the starting left tackle. He had been around, a Pro Bowl player from the Giants' last Super Bowl team.</p>
        <p>''Once I got to know John, I knew there was a guy to help me out and to help me study,'' Fabini said. ''Some of the guys I go against, he knew them. Jumbo seems like an easygoing guy, but he plays very forcefully, powerfully. Almost brutally.''</p>
        <p>A year ago, their off-the-field closeness got them both in trouble in a bar in Long Beach, N.Y., and they are still feeling the reverberations. The pair, each 6 feet 7 inches and 300-plus pounds, were involved in a brawl that also featured their former teammate Matt O'Dwyer. Elliott subsequently pleaded guilty to harassment and disorderly conduct for punching a bar patron and urinating in a sink in the women's bathroom. Charges against Fabini were dismissed, provided he avoided arrest for six months.</p>
        <p>The National Football League suspended Elliott for the first two games of the 2000 season. He has appealed the suspension and will know in a few days whether the league will uphold it. Fabini was fined $14,000 for his involvement; he is appealing the fine.</p>
        <p>Even though Elliott was not around the Jets in the off-season, the two often worked out together at a gym. Elliott says he loves the tacos made by Fabini's wife, Joanne.</p>
        <p>''I think John is glad to be back,'' Fabini said, using Elliott's given name. ''He's happy.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Not that it counts, but WAYNE CHREBET is second in preseason receiving in the National Football League to the Vikings' RANDY MOSS. Chrebet produced a gaudy average of 27.6 yards a reception on 9 catches for 248 yards and 2 touchdowns. The new receiver for the Bucs, a fellow named KEYSHAWN JOHNSON, did not score a touchdown and had 11 catches for 146 yards -- or 13.3 yards a catch. CURTIS MARTIN leads the league's preseason rushers by 92 yards. . . . SHELLEY SMITH, who was the co-author of Johnson's autobiography, has written an article for ESPN The Magazine, in which Johnson tells her, ''I just wish the Jets-Tampa Bay game was in New York. The fans would be hilarious. I'd be like Rocker.'' He was referring to the Atlanta Braves reliever JOHN ROCKER.</p>
