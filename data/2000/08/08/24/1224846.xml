        <p>Roberto Domiziani, left, is a ceramic artist who also makes hand-painted tabletops, above, from volcanic stone that he quarries in Deruta. ''It was my art that brought me to commerce,'' Mr. Domiziani said. He oversees each stone slab as it is dipped in glaze, hand painted by a team of artists and fired in gigantic kilns, which Mr. Domiziani makes available to local artists. The heavy tables cost from about $1,600 for a top 23.6 inches in diameter to nearly $5,000 for one 59 inches in diameter, plus shipping, from www.domiziani.com or by e-mail: ceramica @domiziani.com. Retailers in the United States include Courtyard Collections in Augusta, Ga., (706) 854-9133 and Etruscan Imports in Vero Beach, Fla., (561) 978-0885.</p>
