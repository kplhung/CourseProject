        <p>The United Nations high commissioner for refugees said today that all aid operations in West Timor had been suspended after the severe beating of three refugee relief workers by pro-Indonesian militamen.</p>
        <p>When the attack took place on Tuesday, the three were distributing plastic sheeting to East Timorese refugees in West Timor, which is still ruled by Indonesia. All three were assaulted with machetes, clubs and stones, and one worker had his head held under water in a rice field until he choked and nearly drowned, officials said in Geneva. All suffered severe injuries, officials said.</p>
        <p>Soren Jessen-Petersen, the assistant high commissioner, accused the Indonesian government of allowing the pro-Indonesian militiamen, at least some thought to be backed by the Indonesian military, to behave with impunity, making ''a mockery of statements by responsible officials in Jakarta guaranteeing security for aid workers and refugees.''</p>
        <p>United Nations officials said that Indonesian military units in the area failed to respond to calls for help during the attack, at Kefamenanu, about 78 miles from Kupang, West Timor's capital.</p>
        <p>There have now been more than 100 cases of assaults on aid workers in the past year since the East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia and many fled or were driven from their homes in the militia-led violence that ensued. Officials say that Tuesday's attacks may have been the worst.</p>
        <p>The United Nations was sending a senior refugee official to West Timor to investigate the attack, the refugee commissioner's office said.</p>
        <p>About 125,000 East Timorese remain in West Timor. The United Nations has been trying to register them to determine how many want to stay on Indonesian territory and how many want to return. The effort has been plagued by violence. Nearly 170,000 other East Timorese have already returned to their homeland to be resettled.</p>
        <p>The Indonesian government periodically announces it will close all the refugee camps in West Timor and resettle some of the East Timorese in other parts of Indonesia if they want to stay in the country, but there has been no action. An Indonesian official in Dili, the East Timorese capital, promised today to close down refugee camps in West Timor in three to six months.</p>
        <p>The refugee commissioner's office has repeatedly asked that the militiamen be taken from the camps. Many of the remaining displaced East Timorese are thought to be afraid to voice their wish to return home for fear of attack by the roving militia bands.</p>
