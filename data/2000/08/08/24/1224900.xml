        <p>The Association of South East Asian Nations is declining to release a report that warns of dwindling foreign investment in the region, at the request of at least one association member, an association official said today.</p>
        <p>The annual report on investment, presented to a meeting of the group's 10 foreign ministers in Bangkok last month, is normally made public. Some details in the report, however, have since appeared in local news reports.</p>
        <p>Such a warning is no surprise, but the association's decision not to release the report shows how touchy the issue is. Southeast Asia's economic recovery appears increasingly fragile, reducing the region's attraction to foreign business and investors. At the same time, imminent entry into the World Trade Organization has raised the allure of China.</p>
        <p>''Southeast Asia has fallen off the radar screen,'' said William C. Belchere, head of fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch in Singapore.</p>
        <p>The report, by the association's secretary general, Rodolfo C. Severino, warns that Southeast Asia is rapidly losing foreign investment to competitors elsewhere, especially China, and calls for urgent efforts to promote regional economic integration to regain competitiveness.</p>
        <p>According to one published report, the association report found that foreign investment fell 22 percent in 1999 after falling 21 percent in 1998. Only Singapore had an increase among the group, which also includes Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Vic A. Lactaoen, a spokesman at the association's headquarters in Jakarta, said the report was not released at the request of Singapore.</p>
        <p>Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied having made such a request, and said the decision not to publish the report was made after the secretary broached the issue during a committee meeting before the ministerial meeting. The ministry spokeswoman expressed surprise at the suggestion Singapore might have sought to suppress the report, as its own foreign minister had offered a similarly critical appraisal in a speech at the meeting.</p>
        <p>Foreign investors have been pulling out of the region's stock markets for most of the year in favor of markets to the north. Morgan Stanley Capital International now gives Hong Kong almost the same weight as all of Southeast Asia in its model Asian index.</p>
        <p>Foreign lending, much of which finances foreign investment, has also been falling from $384 billion in early 1997 to $205 billion by the end of last year, according to the Bank for International Settlements.</p>
