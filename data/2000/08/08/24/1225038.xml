        <p>Twice before on this homestand, the Yankees watched their bullpen squander late leads and produce the demoralizing losses that come with blown saves.</p>
        <p>The Yankees witnessed a third failure last night. For a change, they rallied back.</p>
        <p>With their outfield in shambles and their bullpen in ruins, the Yankees came back for a 10-9 victory over the Texas Rangers that helped ease the disappointment of two late losses to Anaheim.</p>
        <p>''Winning the game takes everyone off the hook,'' Tino Martinez said after his single drove home the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning.</p>
        <p>Jorge Posada bounced back from a a four-strikeout game Tuesday by going 3-for-5 with five runs batted in last night, and his two-run home run in the eighth inning tied the score, 9-9.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have struggled on this homestand, splitting the previous six games and frustrating Manager Joe Torre. The Yankees gave their manager more cause for worry last night as the baffling bullpen continued to show an inability to close games.</p>
        <p>Yankees relievers blew a sizable lead for the  third time this week. For the second time, they cost Roger Clemens a victory. Mariano Rivera was responsible last Friday, when he couldn't hold an 8-4 lead in the ninth inning. Last night, he gave up a leadoff double but worked out of a ninth-inning jam to earn his seventh victory.</p>
        <p>With Bernie Williams (sore ribs) and David Justice (sore neck) still out of the lineup and Paul O'Neill leaving with a hip pointer, the outfield was reduced to Luis Polonia in left field, Clay Bellinger in center and Scott Brosius in right field. Brosius, who won a Gold Glove award at third base last season, had made one appearance in right field since joining the Yankees in 1998.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't totally foreign territory,'' said Brosius, who has played 176 games in the outfield in his career. ''I just didn't know how to answer the Bleacher Creatures.''</p>
        <p>Torre said Williams, Justice and O'Neill could all miss today's game, meaning Brosius might start in right.</p>
        <p>After the Yankees wasted a 7-4 lead, Posada tied the score with his eighth-inning homer.</p>
        <p>Polonia led off the ninth with a single off Tim Crabtree and Jose Vizcaino grounded a single past the drawn-in third baseman Mike Lamb when he swung at a 1-1 pitch after squaring to bunt on the first two pitches. Jose Canseco grounded into an apparent double play, but Luis Alicea's throw pulled Frank Catalanotto off first base.</p>
        <p>The left-hander Mike Venafro entered to face Martinez, who grounded an 0-1 pitch just inside the first-baseline and into right field.</p>
        <p>Jeff Nelson, pitching for the fourth straight day, had a shouting match with Torre on Sunday over not being allowed to work out of his own jams. But he could blame no one but himself for last night's failure. Mike Stanton had already alienated fans by allowing Ricky Ledee's three-run homer in the eighth inning. Lefties were hitting .302 off Stanton before that homer wiped out a 7-4 lead.</p>
        <p>''I let the team down,'' Stanton said. ''I let Roger down. There's really no excuse for the way left-handers have hit the ball off me this year.''</p>
        <p>After Stanton heard boos on his way to the dugout, Bill Haselman hit a squibber to the right of the mound. Nelson ran over and reached down but couldn't grip the ball. Haselman reached on the error and Lamb tried to bunt him over, but Posada was charged with an error when the ball spun out of his hands.</p>
        <p>''I thought that was going to be the game,'' Posada said.</p>
        <p>A bunt moved the runners to second and third before Alicea grounded a single up the middle, scoring two runs and ending Nelson's night.</p>
        <p>Posada got himself, and Nelson, off the hook in the bottom of the inning with his home run off Darwin Cubillan, erasing the memory of two errors.</p>
        <p>''You forget about things like that real fast,'' Posada said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have not forgotten their relievers' resumes. Players recalled how strong the bullpen was early in the season and maintained faith that it would be strong come September and the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''This year has been a test of the ability to bounce back for a lot of people on this team,'' Torre said. ''If we can't support them from this end, then it's not fair to them.''</p>
        <p>''It's hard blaming those guys,'' Martinez said. ''They've been carrying us for five years.''</p>
        <p>Clemens overcame his own rough start -- four runs in the first three innings -- to pitch six innings. He  appeared to rediscover his fastball andstruck out the side in the fifth inning. He finished with nine strikeouts and walked four. The Yankees sent eight men to the plate in the first and scored three runs off Kenny Rogers, who did not retire the side in order once last night.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>BERNIE WILLIAMS hopes to rejoin the lineup this weekend, when the Yankees are at Oakland, but Manager JOE TORRE ruled out a return tomorrow and gave no target date. Williams has been sidelined since last Saturday. Williams planned to take indoor batting practice yesterday from the right side. If he felt no pain, he would try batting left-handed, which he was doing when he injured himself. . . . JOSE CANSECO, who hasn't played the field since he played six games in left field last season for Tampa Bay before having back surgery, volunteered to play the field on Tuesday. A sore left heel has limited Canseco to serving as a designated hitter. . . .DAVID JUSTICE (sore neck) did not start for the third straight game but was available to pinch- hit against right-handed pitchers. Torre said Justice is still unable to turn his head.</p>
