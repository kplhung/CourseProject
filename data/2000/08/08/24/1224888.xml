        <p>IF you were to choose a place to construct a high-concept vacation house, it would probably not be Valley Center.</p>
        <p>This remote desert hamlet, beautiful though it is, seems more suited to the citrus groves, avocado orchards and ostrich ranches that cover its rolling hills. Two and a half hours south of Los Angeles, it's a world away from that capital of architectural creativity.</p>
        <p>But here on a Valley Center hilltop sits a brazenly modern structure with metal-wrapped walls cantilevered over a luxuriant orange orchard. Mysteriously ambiguous, it could be an exotic construction trailer -- or a miniature Getty Museum poised against the sky.</p>
        <p>''If my father was shocked by the new architecture, he's never said so,'' Penny Cuff McNulty said of the ingenious house that provides new horizons for three generations of her family.</p>
        <p>Four years ago the house on this hill was a typical ranch belonging to her father, Charles Cuff, now 85. It went up in flames in a raging wildfire, and in three hours the Cuffs lost a home and the heart of the family's century-old citrus-growing operation.</p>
        <p>The Cuffs felt they had to rebuild in the same place to recapture a vital touchstone. But the family itself had changed. Mr. Cuff was semiretired in Los Angeles; his three daughters had married, moved away and had children, ranging in age from 7 to 30. Making Valley Center a getaway offered a saving grace, and a hub where the far-flung clan could reconnect.</p>
        <p>''The family became an unwitting client,'' explained Kevin Daly, 43, a Santa Monica architect, who is married to Mr. Cuff's daughter Dana Cuff. The residence he designed with his partner, Christopher Genik, has introduced startling new ideas into a traditional landscape. Perforated aluminum screens form a protective shell over long glass walls. These screens are architecture in action. Some glide side to side like shiny bifold doors. Others are motorized to move up and down with the push of a button. Set in their stop-action positions, they resemble shimmering silver visors cocked at jaunty angles.</p>
        <p>''Because they came to the project so unexpectedly, they had no preconceptions about what it should be,'' Mr. Daly said. ''But first, we had to figure out what had been lost.'' To Mr. Cuff, the loss seemed devastating. ''I lost everything -- pictures, piano, antiques all went up in smoke,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The insurers naturally had their ideas. A replacement-cost settlement, the family learned, meant replicating the old ranch house, at $120 a foot. But the architects of the family (Dana Cuff is a professor in the architecture department at the University of California, Los Angeles) eventually wooed them with a different design within the replacement-cost calculation.</p>
        <p>''All my father-in-law asked was that we keep it flat,'' Mr. Daly said. ''And I'm sure he would have been just as happy if we had come up with an adobe-style house with a red tile roof, like those you see all over Southern California.''</p>
        <p>But Spanish Mission was not Daly, Genik's hidden agenda. Mr. Daly worked in Frank O. Gehry's office before joining forces 11 years ago with Mr. Genik, a former Rice University classmate.</p>
        <p>The partners are best known for designing simple, boxlike buildings that are wrapped in screens and layers to alter the viewers' perception of structure and space.</p>
        <p>Their approach connects them with larger forces sweeping the international architectural scene. Closely watched trendsetters like the Swiss team of Herzog &amp; de Meuron and the French architect Jean Nouvel have become famous for creating semitransparent facades that change the nature of walls, selectively reveal the interiors, manipulate light and evoke mystery, and no small point, for making beautiful buildings that delight the senses.</p>
        <p>''I told Charlie that if we were going to change anything, we might as well change everything,'' Mr. Daly recalled. ''Fortunately, he was willing to suspend disbelief.''</p>
        <p>In contemplating the new design, the architects faced a creative contradiction. The 3,000-square-foot house had to be flexible enough to accommodate three generations of Cuff family members, including spouses, children and grandchildren. They might visit at any time and in any combination and wanted a place that was always vacation-ready.</p>
        <p>But a house that was too open would not be secure, and security -- especially fire protection -- was a vital concern for the family, whose memories of the big fire lingered.</p>
        <p>The phoenix, it seemed, would have to have a split personality: airy and open one minute, tough as nails the next. Surprisingly, the fire issue became the catalyst for the new design.</p>
        <p>Daly, Genik's solution could be called an open-and-shut vacation house, a Transformer-like structure that springs to life in an instant, then closes completely.</p>
        <p>The transformation is accomplished with large moving parts: perforated screens on the central living and dining area move up and down. Screens along the two bedroom wings, which form a U around the courtyard, are manual and slide side to side with a twist of the wrist. All of them can be adjusted through the day in accordance with the sun's movement, or to allow a little siesta at any time.</p>
        <p>''It's all so easy the kids can do it,'' Dana Cuff said. When it's time to leave, the screens shift into reverse, restoring the protective shell that helps provide peace of mind.</p>
        <p>The unique silver screens were inspired by two ordinary building elements -- the overhead garage door and the sliding bifold door. These doors could be made to pass the architects' personal ingenuity test, that every element they designed should accomplish more than one thing. Their screen doors provide security, shade, interior light control and stunning visual effects.</p>
        <p>When the screen bifold doors on the courtyard-side bedroom wings are opened, they resemble great books wrapped in shiny metal jackets. Most striking are the massive vertical screens protecting the living and dining area, which occupies the taller, central part of the U. Deployed three across on the eastern and western exposures, these monumental 10-by-24-foot screens hang from cross-braced steel tracks, extensions of the interior ceiling's I-beams. Each screen is powered by a small motor that tilts it up and out, angled away from the house.</p>
        <p>''Those living room doors looked so enormous at first,'' Dana Cuff exclaimed at the memory. ''It was a relief to find that they were actually under our control.''</p>
        <p>The silvery sunscreens work wonders with the desert light, and it's the mutable visual perception, the architects say, that is their favorite feature of the design.</p>
        <p>Sunlight filters softly in through the thousands of tiny perforations, charging up the atmosphere; you can almost put your finger on it, like phosphorescence. Looking out through the screens, the dazzling desert light becomes slightly veiled. ''It's like using camera apertures to step down the light,'' Mr. Daly said.</p>
        <p>Shades in summer, they bounce light back into the interior in winter. At sunset, the house looks radiant, with the pink, blue, purple and gold desert light alternately washing over its silver surfaces. Later, it glows like a lantern in the night.</p>
        <p>The screens, with designed-in breathability, Mr. Genik said, make the house habitable in the desert and help with cross-ventilation. All the exterior surfaces reflect sunlight, and the siting captures cooling breezes.</p>
        <p>Inside, there is a simple plan and desert-spare decoration. The main living and dining area floats freely between two long glass walls, with a fireplace to anchor the space and provide seismic stability. An open kitchen is separated from the space by an island counter.</p>
        <p>''We love to cook,'' said Penny Cuff McNulty, who visits from her home near Washington. ''Sometimes, we have four cooks in the kitchen, and it always works.''</p>
        <p>The bedroom wings are also transformable. Thanks again to sliding doors, there can be from four to seven bedrooms, sleeping as many as 14 people. These sleeping alcoves are arrayed single file, like Pullman cars. Birch plywood sliding doors close them off for sleeping or open them to the courtyard's glass walls; other sliding doors, between rooms, allow suitelike spaces for parents with children. The end bedrooms in each wing are private. Some of these rooms have tiny desks for adults working at computers, or children playing with them.</p>
        <p>In lieu of artwork, shots of color enliven the cool, monochromatic shell. Bedroom doors and concrete floors are painted shades of chartreuse, purple, blue and yellow. Kilim rugs brighten bare concrete floors. Dining chairs are candy-coated colors. Bathrooms, tiled in squares of Mexican glass, are vibrant aqua or sapphire. Window frames in the bedroom wings are painted canary yellow.</p>
        <p>The architects' open design plays to the big-sky landscape. Oriented westward, the twin wings of the house frame a long view of the Pacific Ocean, 20 miles away. To the east, Palomar Mountain rises behind the house. From almost any spot it's easy to feel on top of the world.</p>
        <p>''It's like a Donald Judd sculpture placed in the desert,'' said Cameron Armstrong, a Houston architect who clads his houses in corrugated metal. ''It's minimal without being minimalist. You're left alone with the essentials of the place: earth, water, light and sky. There's the potential for a clean moment here.''</p>
        <p>Open and relaxed as it is, the Cuffs' house attempts to erect a fortress against fire. The aluminum screens, while not fireproof, are fire resistant. They prevent ignition that could be caused by sparks or flying embers piercing the interior. Every exposed surface, including outer bedroom walls of corrugated concrete board, is made of a noncombustible material.</p>
        <p>If a fire should start, there is a large-radius rooftop sprinkler system that drenches the house and surrounding landscape. The swimming pool has a special pump and an independent generator so that its water can be diverted for firefighting.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to forget how savage the fire was,'' Mr. Daly said. Still, the rebuilding process was restorative. ''The whole family lost a house, and now the whole family has built it back,'' said Mr. Cuff, who visits weekly from Los Angeles. ''It has bound us together in a new way.'' Now, when family members exchange gifts, they're usually presents for the place they've all come to share.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult to characterize a vacation house as something other than a luxury, a bauble,'' Kevin Daly concluded. ''But this house is different. The entire family had an emotional tie to the ranch. In this case, it's all about being there.''</p>
