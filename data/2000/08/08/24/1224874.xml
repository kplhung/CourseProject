        <p>WHAT do you do when someone stands you up? You stew. You steam. Or perhaps you write a curt note. Douglas Anderson of Manhattan has taken another approach: he sends a virtual voodoo doll.</p>
        <p>''People have stood me up for voice lessons,'' said Mr. Anderson, who is a music teacher. ''They never show up or call.''</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Anderson discovered PinStruck.com, an online service that allows him to send offenders a curse in the image of a grinning voodoo doll, and lets him stay anonymous while doing it.</p>
        <p>''It's the most therapeutic thing,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''It gives me a channel to get it out of my system. As soon as I send off a little effigy, I completely forget about it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson has company. On a typical day, PinStruck sends 2,000 to 3,000 curses. The messages are rendered in spidery handwriting, and senders like Mr. Anderson can choose among 19 curses. The top choices, said Tyson Liotta,  who designed the site for Steem, a Web company in Gaithersburg, Md., are ''You know you like it,'' ''I love you,'' ''Look what you have become'' and ''It's not over yet.''</p>
        <p>The site recently deleted a popular curse that said, ''This is the end of you.'' ''People interpreted it as a death threat,'' Mr. Liotta said.</p>
        <p>Revenge is not the noblest impulse but, with the Internet to hide behind, it has certainly become easier to act upon. Web sites for virtual vengeance give vindictive sorts plenty of ways to get back at the objects of their disaffection. They can drive people crazy with anonymous messages, disparage their enemies and deliver bouquets of dead roses (or worse). It all comes with little effort and almost no chance of exposure.</p>
        <p>''The senders love the fact it is anonymous, and the victims hate it,'' Mr. Liotta said. ''We get so much mail saying, 'I really need to know who sent it.' We have never known or been able to tell anybody.''</p>
        <p>Some revenge sites, like Mother-In-Law Stories, simply offer a forum for well-targeted gripes (motherinlawstories .com). Other less savory sites encourage people to upload unflattering pictures, to ask for suggestions on how best to take revenge or simply to vent in a way that might make a sailor blush.</p>
        <p>A few enterprising people have even set up Web sites dedicated to individuals. ''You're not going to say something hateful to somebody's face, but on a Web site, hey, why not?'' said Matthew Joseff of Reston, Va., who runs a site that allows retribution seekers to post photographs and comments.</p>
        <p>Like flaming, Internet revenge is convenient, nonconfrontational and anonymous. ''People can find in the Internet a means of expression they never could otherwise,'' said Dr. Paul Ciborowski, a psychologist at Long Island University in Brookville, N.Y. Dr. Ciborowski said some of his patients had used the Internet for revenge. ''It allows for impulsivity unchecked,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some sites serve as clearinghouses for the vengeful by running message boards where people can malign those who have done them wrong, glean sympathetic responses, share stories of real-life revenge and gather tips for future use.</p>
        <p>''We rattle people's cages,'' said Michael Baumgartner of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who runs a revenge site. ''The best revenge does not hurt but merely drives someone crazy. Remember, the people you are doing revenge to deserve it. They've done something wrong.'' Mr. Baumgartner, whose day job is in human resources, also has an online store featuring flowers -- dead, wilted or painted black, all sent anonymously.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ciborowski said anonymous postings could be a sort of therapy. ''There's an 'I got it off my chest' kind of thing,'' he said. ''This is a validating group. They understand what you're going through. Otherwise, they  wouldn't be on this Web site.''</p>
        <p>But what is funny or therapeutic to the sender can be anything but to the recipient. Dr. Ciborowski drew a distinction between anonymous postings and anonymous e-mail messages, which he called vindictive and potentially frightening. ''You don't know who sent it or why,'' he said. ''You're suspicious of anyone who might have a grievance against you. Individuals who do this kind of thing tend to be passive-aggressive.''</p>
        <p>The anonymity of a nasty message makes it especially threatening, said Sheila Heen, co-author of ''Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most'' (Viking Press, 1999). ''I don't think we appreciate the impact it has,'' said Ms. Heen, who teaches negotiation at Harvard Law School. ''You're thinking, 'Why does someone hate me so much?' ''</p>
        <p>''If you're slashing someone's tires,'' she added, ''it's easier to know you're stepping out of the normal bounds of behavior. On the Internet, the action is consistent with a million other actions you take in the course of a day. You click to sell stock, to transfer money, to e-mail a friend, to e-mail an enemy.''</p>
        <p>Although many revenge sites emphasize that they are to be used only for entertainment, said Mr. Liotta, the designer of the virtual voodoo doll, ''no one respects that.''</p>
        <p>''They send it to the most fearful person they know,'' he said. ''That person freaks out, but there's nobody to yell at except us. Some people take it a lot more seriously than we anticipated.''</p>
        <p>Despite frequent requests, Mr. Liotta refuses to allow senders to write their own messages. Nor can senders choose -- for technical reasons -- where on the doll to stick the pins.</p>
        <p>Another variation on anonymous revenge comes from a service that allows users to send e-mail messages that appear to be coming from someone else.</p>
        <p>One satisfied user of that service is Sam Downing of Chatsworth, Calif. ''I have always enjoyed practical jokes,'' Mr. Downing said. When a colleague showed off his brand-new Honda Accord a few months ago, Mr. Downing couldn't resist a trick. ''I sent him an e-mail from the dealership saying the car was being recalled,'' he said. ''It was the first car he had ever bought.''</p>
        <p>The colleague, Jeffrey Tani, was so upset that co-workers, who were in on the joke, made Mr. Downing confess.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tani said, ''It looked authentic.''</p>
        <p>A disclaimer at the site warns against using the service for abusive, offensive or illegal purposes. The disclaimer started out as a lighthearted admonition, but it grew increasingly severe because people abused the service, said Antony Robbins, a computer programmer in England who runs the service with his brother, Peter.</p>
        <p>Since the brothers started the site last year, they said, they have been queried about a half-dozen times by the F.B.I. and police departments, mostly, Mr. Robbins said, about teenagers harassing teachers.</p>
        <p>In many cases, the brothers can trace the sender. If a recipient complains, they will not send any more e-mail to that address.</p>
        <p>The service sends about 300 e-mail notes a day. Activity spiked a few months ago when it was mentioned on a syndicated radio show. Mr. Baumgartner said: ''The world is filled with miserable people. They all have the same theme.''</p>
