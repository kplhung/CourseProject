        <p>The decision by Attorney General Janet Reno not to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Vice President Al Gore's statements about his role in 1996 fund-raising activities means Mr. Gore is essentially clear of any criminal jeopardy, law enforcement officials said today.</p>
        <p>''Because further investigation is not likely to result in a prosecutable case under applicable criminal law and principles of federal prosecution, I have concluded that a special counsel is not warranted,'' Ms. Reno told reporters today.</p>
        <p>In acknowledging that she had rejected the advice of a top Justice Department investigator to name a special prosecutor, Ms. Reno sought to portray her decision as a narrow one that cleared Mr. Gore only of making false statements in an April 18 interview with law enforcement officials. She said the four-year inquiry into fund-raising would continue.</p>
        <p>But some law enforcement officials said that the reasoning Ms. Reno used in declining to seek a special prosecutor meant that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to investigate Mr. Gore for any issue related to his role in raising campaign donations in the 1996 presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno said she had concluded that the transcript of the April 18 interview did not show that Mr. Gore was lying when he insisted that White House coffees and his 1996 visit to a Buddhist temple were not fund-raising events.</p>
        <p>''The transcript reflects neither false statements nor perjury, each of which requires proof of a willfully false statement about a material matter,'' Ms. Reno said. ''Rather, the transcript reflects disagreements about labels.''</p>
        <p>In June, Robert J. Conrad Jr., the head of the campaign finance unit at the Justice Department, recommended that a special counsel be named to investigate whether Mr. Gore had made false statements in describing his role in the April 1996 visit to a Buddhist temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif., and numerous coffee sessions at the White House with potential donors. Both the appearance at the Hsi Lai Temple and the coffees resulted in campaign donations to the Democratic Party or the national ticket.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore told Mr. Conrad in the April interview that he did not regard any of those events as fund-raising events. Mr. Gore initially said he had been at only one such coffee. Mr. Conrad then told him that the record showed that he had, in fact, been the host at 23 of them and had attended an additional eight with President Clinton as the host.</p>
        <p>In rejecting Mr. Conrad's advice, Ms. Reno said, ''Mr. Conrad's recommendation did not go to the underlying events, it went just to the statements.'' She said the campaign task force headed by Mr. Conrad was free to pursue any violations that might have been committed during the coffees or the temple visit.</p>
        <p>But the law enforcement officials said Mr. Gore's only potential legal liability was whether he had misrepresented the events, not his participation in them.</p>
        <p>''She has now cleared him of that,'' one official said on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>That means Mr. Gore is inoculated from new efforts to prosecute him as he heads into the final months of his presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said: ''We are pleased with today's Justice Department announcement. However, Al Gore is going to continue to do what he has been doing all along, focus on America's families.''</p>
        <p>Senator Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican who headed a committee which investigated accusations of fund-raising improprieties in 1996, said, ''Janet Reno has steadfastly refused to follow the recommendations of her career law enforcement officers and allow an independent investigation of high-ranking administration officials. There was never any reason to believe that she would do any differently in this case.''</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee, said in a statement, ''While it's clear that Al Gore engaged in a number of questionable fund-raising activities and then gave the F.B.I. statements that continue to raise all the issues of his credibility, the American people are sick and tired of all these scandals and investigations. The best way to put all these scandals and investigations behind us is to elect someone new.''</p>
        <p>On two previous occasions, Ms. Reno rejected advice to seek an outside criminal inquiry of Mr. Gore. She did so on those occasions over the objections of Louis J. Freeh, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and several senior Justice Department officials, including Charles G. LaBella, a predecessor of Mr. Conrad.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno acknowledged that Mr. Conrad was supported in his recommendation by others in the Justice Department, disputing news accounts today that quoted a senior department official as saying Mr. Conrad was alone in his view that a special counsel was warranted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad declined to comment, but associates said he was troubled by the decision, with one describing him as ''angry and disappointed.''</p>
