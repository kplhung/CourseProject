        <p>A blue-and-yellow umbrella flapped in the breeze as Andrea Lupo, clad in a blue bathing suit and a deep tan, ordered lunch with mustard, relish, onions and sauerkraut, to a chorus of ''disgusting'' from a clutch of wide-eyed contemporaries.</p>
        <p>Asked how many hot dogs he had eaten on a recent afternoon, Andrea, 14, grinned and, with playful exaggeration, replied, ''Oh, 60, maybe.'' His pals ordered theirs slathered in mustard or swimming in ketchup.</p>
        <p>Andrea's appetite cheers hearts at a company not far from Fregene, an Italian seaside resort about an hour west of Rome, that is trying a curious culinary experiment. If it succeeds, the Sabrett hot dog, icon of Broadway and habitue of Madison Square Garden, will be added to Europe's growing menu of American-style fast-food dishes.</p>
        <p>Already, the pushcart outside Gilda on the Beach, a local club and discotheque, sells 40 to 50 a day, and more than 200 in the early hours of the morning, when the disco shuts down and exhausted patrons grab a hot dog before climbing aboard their Vespas and Ducatis for the ride home. The company, American Food Products, began selling the hot dogs last spring, and now serves soccer stadiums, amusement parks, discotheques, highway rest stops, and dozens of pushcarts in Italian cities.</p>
        <p>The reasoning behind the venture is as fundamental as, well, a frank. While American fast-food products like the hamburger, the doughnut and fried chicken have captured the palates of Europeans, the humble hot dog, which despite its Germanic resemblance to wurst is considered the most American of all these, remains stranded on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>''I was thinking of the success of the hamburger,'' said Pasquale L. Figorito, president of American Food Products, explaining that the four original McDonald's restaurants in Rome make 10 million sales a year. ''It's just amazing,'' he said. ''The United States is known as a country for hamburgers, but statistics show that in America, seven hot dogs are eaten for every hamburger. So maybe we have fertile terrain.''</p>
        <p>Such terrain prompted a group of investors, including some from the United States, to bid enough to win the exclusive license for Sabrett hot dogs in Europe. Italy is the first market, but Mr. Figorito says he plans to sell hot dogs elsewhere, in Britain and Spain, for example if the Italian experiment succeeds. To do so, American Food has registered a parent company in Luxembourg. Within a year or so, he said, expansion could begin.</p>
        <p>Now, when Rome's rival soccer clubs, Roma and Lazio, compete in Olympic Stadium, hawkers sell Sabrett's hot dogs in the bleachers. At the recent Italian Open tennis tournament, Sabrett's distinct yellow-and-blue umbrellas lured hungry fans. At highway rest stops in northern Italy, the frankfurters are catching on.</p>
        <p>''We're selling about 9,000 to 10,000 hot dogs a day,'' said Mr. Figorito, an enthusiast of American food. His goal for Italy, he says, is 60,000 to 70,000 a day, adding, ''My dream is double that.'' In a few years he hopes to have Sabrett hot dog outlets, modeled on McDonald's restaurants and selling steak fries, crinkle cuts and, maybe, potato knishes, in Italian cities.</p>
        <p>''I never thought Italians would go for pickle relish,'' he said. Still, he acknowledges, not everything related to Sabrett's travels well. The company slogan, for instance, ''We're on a roll,'' had to be abandoned in Europe. ''It would take three years to explain here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For Sabrett, a unit of Marathon Enterprises in East Rutherford, N.J., which produces about a million hot dogs a week, that is small change. But Sabrett -- which recovered last year from a contamination of its products by listeria, a food-borne bacteria, that is suspected of having caused two deaths -- welcomes the European expansion. Boyd G. Adelman, Marathon's executive vice president responsible for Sabrett, said that while the priority market remains ''a 100-mile radius around New York,'' the company had begun expanding nationally, notably through discount chains like BJ's Wholesale Club Inc., and was also shipping small quantities of hot dogs to South Korea, Japan and Mexico. ''We are expanding on an international scale, and Italy is important,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Figorito, 39, who is originally from Elmwood Park, N.J., got to know Sabrett's products while growing up in New Jersey, before settling in Italy after college. Meeting Mr. Adelman through a mutual friend several years ago, he conceived the Pygmalion-like idea of grooming the New York hot dog for the Continental taste.</p>
        <p>But first, he had to deal with European bureaucracy. Sabrett stepped into Europe at the height of a trade war between Washington and the European Union over food products, like bananas, which prompted the Europeans to reduce the number of their inspectors in American food plants to one from 16, making it impractical to consider importing hot dogs from Sabrett factories into Europe.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Figorito signed up Cremonini S.p.A., an Italian company whose $1.2 billion of annual revenue makes it one of Europe's biggest food processors, to produce the frankfurters at an Italian factory using Sabrett's recipe. Since skinless, all-beef sausages like Sabrett's are virtually unknown in Europe, where pork and poultry predominate, Cremonini had to master Sabrett's technology, Mr. Figorito said. The spices for the hot dogs, Mr. Adelman of Sabrett said, are shipped from the United States, where they are mixed ''according to our age-old, secret recipe.''</p>
        <p>The buns are baked in Barcelona by Bimbo S.A., a unit of Earthgrains, the St. Louis bakers, which also turn out rolls in Europe for Burger King. Bimbo modified its machines to slice Sabrett's typically hinged bun.</p>
        <p>And Sabrett's pushcarts could not meet European standards. Considered mobile restaurants by European Union definition, the pushcarts had to have a working sink and a locker for employee clothing. Mr. Figorito proudly showed a redesigned cart, a tiny sink clinging to one side and a miniature locker, perhaps big enough for a rolled-up shirt, on the other.</p>
        <p>Moreover, since European hygiene rules do not allow soft drinks in cans or bottles to be stored in chopped ice, the way they are in New York, the European pushcarts are outfitted with small refrigerators.</p>
        <p>Three carts had to be turned over to European inspectors for crash tests, to see how well vendors and customers would survive a traffic accident.</p>
        <p>Not even Sabrett's onions and sauerkraut could survive the European bureaucratic onslaught. Formaric acid used as a preservative in the American-prepared onions is banned in Europe and had to be replaced with citric acid. The Europeans also ban the use of sodium benzoid, a common preservative in sauerkraut, so a substitute had to be found.</p>
        <p>Clearly, the American Food Products investors are seeking to cash in on Europeans' unslaked appetite for fast food and on the continuing spread of restaurant franchising. But they are also seeking business among Europe's growing Islamic population, as immigrants from Muslim countries in Africa and the Middle East arrive in search of jobs.</p>
        <p>''As Europe grows more multi-ethnic,'' said Franco Pantaleoni, a food industry consultant who helped set up American Food, ''we are using more products that are pure beef.'' But he would not deny that the biggest market is children.</p>
        <p>The hot dogs sell at Gilda's for the equivalent of $2.50, well above the $1.50 typically charged by New York pushcart vendors. Yet Sergio Lorina, 52, who operates the pushcart at Gilda's, said price was no obstacle. ''Mainly kids eat them,'' he said, ''and the more daring adults.''</p>
        <p>Marina Ciaralli, whose children Matteo, 12, and Marta, 9, were munching on hot dogs with the works -- mustard and ketchup, relish and sauerkraut -- agreed. The slice of pizza she was eating cost about the same as her children's hot dogs, she said.</p>
        <p>Asked whether she had tried a hot dog, she replied hesitantly: ''Not today. Maybe tomorrow.''</p>
