        <p>After winning his first hardcourt title as an unseeded player in last year's Hamlet Cup, Magnus Norman reached the fourth round of the United States Open before a back injury forced him to withdraw. It was his best showing in a Grand Slam event to that point.</p>
        <p>''I was so confident coming from a win here, I was hitting so well, it was a shame I had to withdraw,'' Norman said yesterday after dispatching Jonas Bjorkman, 6-4, 6-1, in the Hamlet Cup in Commack, N.Y. ''But I think I'm a better player this year.''</p>

        <p>After winning his first hardcourt title as an unseeded player in last year's Hamlet Cup, Magnus Norman reached the fourth round of the United States Open before a back injury forced him to withdraw. It was his best showing in a Grand Slam event to that point.</p>
        <p>''I was so confident coming from a win here, I was hitting so well, it was a shame I had to withdraw,'' Norman said yesterday after dispatching Jonas Bjorkman, 6-4, 6-1, in the Hamlet Cup in Commack, N.Y. ''But I think I'm a better player this year.''</p>
        <p>Norman, a 24-year-old Swede who is ranked No. 3 in the world and seeded third for the Open, has won three titles this year: at Auckland, New Zealand, Rome, and Bastad, Sweden. He also reached the semifinals of the Australian Open and the final of the French Open, where he lost to Gustavo Kuerten.</p>
        <p>''I got off to a slow start in the French,'' Norman said. ''But after that I played well. I think my results this year have been the result of a lot of hard work.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday he took just 1 hour 12 minutes to get past Bjorkman, his fellow Swede, winning 20 of 24 first-serve points. ''It was my best match so far this year,'' Norman said. ''I'm moving good, feeling good. I'm going to work hard this weekend. I'm definitely ready.''</p>
        <p>The same could not be said of No. 2-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, who was eliminated in straight sets, 6-1, 6-3, by Karol Kucera of the Czech Republic in another second-round match.</p>
        <p>''It's impossible to win every match,'' Kafelnikov said. ''Maybe in the back of my mind I'm trying to save energy for the Grand Slam. I'm sure I'll be ready for the Open.''</p>
        <p>In the only other match completed before a rain delay, Fernando Meligeni, a qualifier from Brazil, upset ninth-seeded Albert Costa of Spain, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2. Arnaud Clement, seeded 15th, was leading George Bastl in the third set and No. 5 Cedric Pioline was down a set to Andrei Pavel before play was interrupted.</p>
