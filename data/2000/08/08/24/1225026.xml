        <p>Ray Lane, who abruptly resigned from the Oracle Corporation last month as president and chief operating officer, said today that he had joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, the leading Silicon Valley venture capital firm, as a general partner. Mr. Lane, who is 53, joined Oracle in 1991 from Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, where he headed the information technology consulting group. ''It's really a lifestyle change for me,'' Mr. Lane said in a telephone interview. ''It's a very individual decision in that for the last 20 years I've spent 75 percent of my life on airplanes, and sat through a lot of unproductive meetings. I loved being the president of Oracle, but if you look at the quantity of time you're stealing from your life and your family, it's huge,'' he said, adding that he has a 19-month-old son and a daughter on the way.</p>
