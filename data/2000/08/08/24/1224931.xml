        <p>Last night's two-hour finale of the CBS hit ''Survivor'' was the talk of City Hall all day yesterday. At a morning news conference on the City Hall steps, HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON was asked who she thought would be the last person on the South Pacific island.

        <p>Name Games At City Hall</p>
        <p>Last night's two-hour finale of the CBS hit ''Survivor'' was the talk of City Hall all day yesterday. At a morning news conference on the City Hall steps, HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON was asked who she thought would be the last person on the South Pacific island. ''I think we should take a vote,'' she said. The public advocate, MARK GREEN, piped up, ''I'm for Rudy!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Green was presumably referring to the contestant RUDY BOESCH, 72, a retired Navy Seal, and not to MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI, a longtime nemesis of Mr. Green. The crowd laughed.</p>
        <p>Later, at a news conference in the City Hall Blue Room, the other Rudy put on a ''Rudy'' cap and said, ''I'm rooting for Rudy.'' Then Mr. Giuliani admitted that he knew nothing else about the ''Survivor'' contestant. But he did say that his hat, which came from a 1993 movie called ''Rudy,'' had been worn by President Clinton. Asked if he would wear a hat that said ''Hillary,'' who would have been his opponent in the race for the United States Senate had he not dropped out, the mayor responded, ''Not unless I had a lot to drink the night before.''</p>
        <p>Tales of the Tapes In Custody Battle</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the witness and the lawyers in JUSTICE EILEEN C. BRANSTEN'S courtroom in State Supreme Court in Manhattan said, ''Let's go to the videotape.'' Or words to that effect.</p>
        <p>The witness was PATRICIA DUFF, who was being cross-examined by lawyers for her former husband, the makeup mogul RONALD O. PERELMAN, in their long-running custody case involving their 5-year-old daughter, CALEIGH. Mr. Perelman's lawyers repeatedly asked Ms. Duff about her practice of videotaping Caleigh after she visited Mr. Perelman. They mentioned a videotape made two years ago in which Caleigh yelled, ''No, mommy, no!'' and pleaded for Ms. Duff to put the camera down.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perelman's lawyers also asked if it was true that Caleigh had said she hated being videotaped. Ms. Duff first said she did not recall. Later, she said that she recalled two occasions when Caleigh had said she did not enjoy being videotaped.</p>
        <p>The questioning then turned to audio tapes Ms. Duff had made. She was questioned about one in which Caleigh, home with Ms. Duff after visiting Mr. Perelman, says she cannot say what she did at her father's house because it's a secret. Mr. Perelman's lawyers indicated that during a 10-minute tape, Ms. Duff asked Caleigh 25 times what the secret was. On another audio tape, made on a different day, Ms. Duff asked Caleigh 30 times what her father had told her. When asked if it was true that she had asked Caleigh dozens of times, Ms. Duff responded: ''I haven't counted. That sounds high.''</p>
        <p>For the Doormen, An Updated Look</p>
        <p>The fashion designer CHOMPOL SERIMONT remembers meeting IRA DRUKIER, the real estate developer who hired him to design the uniforms for employees at Chambers, a 77-room hotel at West 56th Street that is scheduled to open in the fall. Chambers, by the way, will have alpaca couches and leather-covered pillars in the lobby and original art by the likes of JOHN WATERS.</p>
        <p>''At first I was like, what am I going to do?'' Mr. Serimont said yesterday. ''Ira looks conservative.'' Yesterday, Mr. Serimont looked anything but: he was wearing what he described as ''sailor-cut pants.'' They had a jungle print, like an Hermes scarf without the beady-eyed beasts lurking at the edges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Serimont said he soon learned not to judge his client by appearances. The coat that Mr. Serimont designed for the doormen? ''He said it was too basic,'' Mr. Serimont said. ''He said I have to do something different. For me, I can put it on, and it's very fashionable. This is the doorman. He said, 'I don't want to look like the Plaza Hotel.' So I'm going to play with the color, and it's not going to be a one-piece sleeve anymore.''</p>
        <p>So what color will it be? ''The color's going to be wacky,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He mentioned aubergine with ''deep, deep orange'' for fall and winter, and ''peach mixed with deep indigo'' for spring and summer. He mentioned showing the uniforms during Fashion Week next month. And he mentioned giving the models hard hats. He pulled out a white one, but said he would prefer orange.</p>
