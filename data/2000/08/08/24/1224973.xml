        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Defense in the 21st Century'' (editorial, Aug. 21): As a former commander of the Air Force's Air Combat Command from 1996 to 1999, I saw firsthand the effects of a mismatch between the resources devoted to defense and the demands placed on our forces.</p>
        <p>The number of aircraft out of commission awaiting spare parts or maintenance nearly doubled. The number of airmen and officers choosing to make the Air Force a career declined. And the money needed to maintain the facilities where our people live and work nearly disappeared.</p>
        <p>All this during a ''procurement holiday'' that drove a steady increase in the average age of our weapon systems. Last year's modest increases in defense spending came too late and are not sufficient for the strategy they are meant to support.</p>
        <p>Readiness remains an issue and should be a part of the defense debate.</p>
        <p>RICHARD E. HAWLEY  Newport News, Va., Aug. 21, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a retired Air Force general.</p>
