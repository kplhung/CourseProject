        <p>For eight hours each day, in a desolate warehouse with stone walls, some 12 men and a couple of women in this village of squat adobe houses learn to build furniture with circular saws and power drills.</p>
        <p>The government pays for the training and gives each aspiring carpenter a small stipend, but the goal is not to prepare them for scarce and poorly paid jobs at home. It is to give them skills they can use when they migrate -- usually illegally -- to the United States.</p>
        <p>The program is one of many begun here in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato by the former governor,  Vicente Fox Quesada, who is making his first visit to Washington on Thursday since being elected president in a landmark victory in June.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox plans to use his informal meetings with President Clinton and the two American presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore and  Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, to encourage them to join in his vision of a sea change in relations along the 2,000-mile border, in particular one more open to the flow of Mexican laborers. As he does so, the voices of those workers he has helped train in his home state will echo in the background.</p>
        <p>''Mexico has many working hands and America has many jobs,'' said Claudio Torres Resendiz, 33, one of those being trained in Coroneo. ''We do the work they need, and they pay us the money we need to take care of our families. Both sides benefit.''</p>
        <p>American officials have so far been less than enthusiastic about Mr. Fox's idea. And his job-training programs, like the one here, have been criticized both within and outside Mexico as encouraging the exodus of Mexican laborers for menial jobs in the United States. About 340,000 already migrate each year, some legally, others illegally.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fox defends his initiatives -- which mostly offer training in low-skill jobs as landscapers, construction workers, factory workers and maids -- as a pragmatic way to increase the earning potential of workers that Mexico simply cannot sustain.</p>
        <p>A straight-talking son of ranchers and a former business executive who focuses on the bottom line, Mr. Fox considers the labor force one of his nation's proudest and most lucrative assets. His plans for the border, he says, would force the United States to face up to its need for Mexican workers, rather than treating the migrants' contributions to the American economy as a kind of dirty economic secret.</p>
        <p>''We have the people, and people are an asset'' Mr. Fox said in an interview at his family ranch in the state of Guanajuato before leaving for the United States. ''I know many people in the United States want to see people as a burden, as a problem, but people are an asset.''</p>
        <p>''That is why we are going to invest and invest heavily in people,'' the president-elect went on. ''If we have talented people, not only will Mexico progress, the United States will benefit and progress.''</p>
        <p>When asked to explain his visions for an open border and better working conditions for migrants, the typically practical Mr. Fox turned suddenly passionate and cast back to life here in his home state. It is the state with Mexico's third-highest rate of migration to the United States. During various seasons of the year, isolated villages are almost completely abandoned by able-bodied men and women as they go to the United States to work.</p>
        <p>The carpentry training program Mr. Fox began here is far from cutting edge. Students work primarily with outdated tools and learn the most rudimentary techniques while assembling tables and chairs.</p>
        <p>But for workers like Mr. Torres, who has worked illegally on peanut and cotton farms in Mississippi for the last 15 years, the workshop  means not only the possibility to make more money abroad, but also the chance to seek work with his head held high.</p>
        <p>''Working in the fields is very hard and the pay is getting worse,'' he said. ''But I did not have the chance to finish high school, I had to take whatever work I could get. I am trying to better myself so I do not have to take that humiliation anymore.''</p>
        <p>During his campaign for president, Mr. Fox was widely criticized for a private initiative that has sent some 300 men from Guanajuato to work legally as landscapers on golf courses in Michigan over the last three years.</p>
        <p>One of the more popular promises of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari as he negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada was that Mexico would strive to increase exports of products, not people. But the benefits of Nafta have been felt less among Mexico's 40 million poor, and the number of Mexican immigrants to the United States  has not significantly declined.</p>
        <p>Unlike many of his predecessors, Mr. Fox publicly accepts his country's inability to offer its workers the kinds of salaries and living conditions offered in the United States. Until his administration is able to begin narrowing the wage gap -- he has pledged annual economic growth of 7 percent and the creation of 1.35 million new jobs each year -- Mr. Fox wants more Mexican workers to be able to cross the border without violence and harassment. And he wants to make it easier for immigrants to invest more of their earnings from abroad back home.</p>
        <p>An example of that kind of economic return stands at the entrance of a village called Timbinal, where Napa Valley vineyard workers paid for the building of a small apparel factory to employ women who stay behind.</p>
        <p>One of the workers, Rosa Maria Sierra Lopez, 21, said her job at the plant was the first thing in her life that had made her feel useful. But she said it was not enough to make up for the pain that the northern migration inflicts on her town and her home.</p>
        <p>Most of the men in the village, she said, spend more time in the United States than they do at home. And each year her 52-year-old father risks his life by illegally crossing the United States border to work in apple orchards in the American Northwest. It is a journey he has made  since before she was born, Ms. Sierra said.</p>
        <p>''It's very hard for us to see him go,'' she said, pressing her eyes closed to hold back tears. ''It's hard for all of us.''</p>
        <p>As expected, Mr. Fox's talk of opening the border to increased legal migration has been met mostly with polite skepticism from officials in Washington.</p>
        <p>And while analysts consider Mr. Fox's trip to be the beginning of a long campaign -- one that he himself predicts could take 30 years -- none dismissed the president-elect's ideas as impossible. Labor groups as well as immigrant activists have joined together to support legislation proposed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, that would legalize some 1.1 million undocumented residents.</p>
        <p>''People in the U.S. hear open border and they panic,'' said Pamela Falk, a former staff director of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee in the House of Representatives. ''That's not what he's trying to do. He's trying to adjust the laws to fit the reality in a way that would be good for the American economy and for Mexican workers.''</p>
        <p>John Bailey, director of the Mexico Project at Georgetown University, said: ''At first I thought Fox was pushing a nonstarter. But my second reaction was that what he says is really interesting. And even though he may not get everything he wants, he will get a new conversation started.''</p>
        <p>Ismael Rojas, 65, doubts he will see the day when the men in his native La Calera will stop leaving their families to work in the United States. He did it for 25 years -- most of that time as an undocumented worker -- and his sinuses are still choked from his work at an Illinois lumber company.</p>
        <p>He has retired to the sprawling house he built with his life's earnings. Two cars and a tractor are parked inside a huge shed in the back and the garden is full of fruit trees.</p>
        <p>Everything he has, he said, comes from his labor in the United States. Now it is his sons who work up north. One was given legal status under a broad amnesty approved by Congress in 1986; the other has a seasonal permit to work at a golf course in Michigan. He is happy that his sons do not have to endure the insecurity and shame of living illegally in the United States. Still, Mr. Rojas said, the advances are bittersweet.</p>
        <p>''In Mexico,'' he said, ''you can either abandon your children to make money to take care of them, or you can stay with your children and watch them live in misery. Poverty makes us leave our families. I want President Fox to create jobs, jobs that are well paid, so that our families can stay together.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 26, 2000, Saturday  Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about proposals by Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox Quesada, to allow more Mexicans to work legally in the United States misstated the month he was elected. It was July, not June.</p>
