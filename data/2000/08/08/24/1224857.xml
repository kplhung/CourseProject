        <p>THEY won't beam fresh towels up to the room, but Palm handhelds that can send and receive infrared signals will soon function as check-in desks and even room keys for travelers who stay at some hotels.</p>
        <p>The system will beam room numbers and door lock codes from the computer network at the hotel's registration desk to a guest's Palm through infrared ports. When the guest gets to the room, the Palm will transmit an infrared signal to a chip in the door lock to open the room.</p>
        <p>The system was developed by Suite Technology System Network, based in Salt Lake City, and Micros Systems, in Columbia, Md.</p>
        <p>Technology is already an important part of the amenities offered by major hotels, many of which let guests use their television remote controls to do things like checking out. The next wave of technology is expected to let hotels offer many more services to guests and tailor those services to match personal needs and preferences.</p>
        <p>The first installation of the Palm-based communication system is at the Charles Hotel in Cambridge, Mass. The hotel's general manager, Michael Doyle, said each guest would also be able to choose the room temperature, the type of pillow and the time for a wake-up call through a keyboard wired to the hotel network and the Internet. A high-definition television acts as a monitor in each room.</p>
        <p>Guests will also be able to order room service and use their Internet accounts via the keyboards. Each guest's preferences will be stored, along with information like bookmarked Web sites, so they can be called up if the guest returns.</p>
        <p>''We'll be looking at how we can communicate with these devices and set the tone for a customer's arrival,'' Mr. Doyle said. The Palm system and network for rooms will be available at the Charles early next year.</p>
        <p>Palm-based door openers are also being used in the real estate industry. Last year, Palm Inc. and Supra Products, a company that makes electronic locks, introduced the eKEY, a devices that attaches to the Palm Vx to give a real estate agent access to a house (as well as access to market information through the device's wireless and cradle connections).</p>
        <p>Many hotels are working on ways to provide automated wireless services to their customers. Joe Lazlo, a senior analyst at Jupiter Communications, said the Charles Hotel was taking a small but innovative step toward wireless personalization, while much of the hotel industry seemed to be waiting for the widespread adoption of a single wireless platform.</p>
        <p>''Attempts to do these cool wireless applications have been somewhat limited,'' Mr. Lazlo said. ''Wireless communication is neat stuff, but deployment on a nationwide basis really begs a reliable standard that vendors in a whole bunch of different industries can agree on.''</p>
        <p>Many in the hotel industry say they believe that the winning platform will be Bluetooth, which is being developed by Intel, Nokia, Ericsson and other electronics and telecommunications companies and will connect cellular phones and handhelds with computers. The companies involved include 3Com, which recently spun off Palm Inc., and Microsoft, which makes Pocket PC software; not surprisingly, both Palm and Pocket PC devices are expected to become compatible with Bluetooth.</p>
        <p>Employees at the Sheraton New Orleans Hotel are using Pocket PC handheld computers that link wirelessly to the hotel network to enter housekeeping information.  W. J. Kitchen, chief executive of Amaranth Technology Systems, which makes the software to link the Pocket PC devices to the hotel network, said the system would ultimately run on Bluetooth.</p>
        <p>''We'll start to see Bluetooth-equipped handhelds and cell phones,'' he said, ''which will both automatically check in customers and transmit information to the hotel staff to let them greet returning customers by name or offer them a bottle of their favorite wine.''</p>
        <p>Hotel industry experts say wireless technology will let personalized customer service become more automated in the next few years.</p>
        <p>''The Palm application is somewhat dependent on the number of people who have a wireless Palm device,'' said David Moon, a partner in the hotel industry group at Arthur Andersen in Phoenix. ''But we think the wireless Web offers a very significant opportunity in terms of automating not only check-in, but services within the hotel, like authenticating entry into the health club.''  The challenge for hotels, Mr. Moon said, will be to integrate their current networks with the new wireless applications.</p>
        <p>He said there was also the question of how hotels with a high level of personal service would incorporate these technologies.</p>
        <p>''The higher-end hotels often rely on the front desk interaction as one of the most meaningful interactions with the guest,'' he said. ''And they don't want to lose that because it could dilute their brand identity.''</p>
        <p>That is a real concern, said Tim Harvey,  the chief information officer for the Hilton Hotels Corporation, based in Beverly Hills, Calif. ''We've tested things from check-in kiosks to curbside check-in to check-in on airport buses, and I think there needs to be a balance,'' he said. ''There are going to be customers for a long time who are going to want to walk up to the front desk and talk to a person. I think people are going to go toward a more expeditious check-in, but it's a long way out.''</p>
