        <p>Kevin McAuliffe, a speechwriter for three New York City mayors and the editor of a collection of comments by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani  published this year, died Saturday. He was 50 and lived in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The cause was a heart attack, his family said.</p>
        <p>Mr. McAuliffe worked as a speechwriter and press aide for Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. He also worked for a few months for Mr. Giuliani before being dismissed in 1994 as a holdover from Democratic administrations.</p>
        <p>Mr. McAuliffe compiled ''Sayings of Generalissimo Giuliani,'' quotations on subjects including crime and sending garbage to Virginia, assembled for comic effect.</p>
        <p>At his death, Mr. McAuliffe ran a communications consulting firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. McAuliffe, born in the Bronx, graduated from Fairfield University in Connecticut and received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University. He began his career as a journalist in New England. He also wrote ''The Great American Newspaper: The Rise and Fall of the Village Voice'' (1978).</p>
        <p>Mr. McAuliffe is survived by his wife, Paulette Theresa, whom he married in April; his mother, Ethel; a sister, Alice Callahan; two brothers, Daniel and Paul; and two nieces.</p>
