        <p>The top creative executive at the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, which is 49 percent owned by the B Com3  Group, is leaving to join the New York office of Wieden &amp; Kennedy, which is based in Portland, Ore. Ty Montague was named creative director at the New York office, succeeding Stacy Wall, who left earlier this month to join Hungry Man in New York, a commercial and TV production company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montague, 37, will team up with Amy Nicholson, who joined Wieden &amp; Kennedy this month, in overseeing all creative accounts out of the office. Those accounts include ESPN and Nike. Mr. Montague had been creative director for United States operations for Bartle Bogle, which is based in London. He helped set up the New York office when he joined in September 1998 and worked there for clients like Reebok and Johnny Walker.</p>
