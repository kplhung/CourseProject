        <p>Consumers received another dose of bad news on the energy front yesterday as an unexpected decline in crude oil inventories sent home heating oil prices to their highest in a decade.</p>
        <p>The surprising drop was reported in two surveys, one by the American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, and one by the United States Energy Information Administration, released yesterday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of crude oil for October delivery jumped 80 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $32.02 a barrel, while the price of heating oil for September delivery rose 5.26 cents, or 5.8 percent, to 95.61 cents a gallon.</p>

        <p>Consumers received another dose of bad news on the energy front yesterday as an unexpected decline in crude oil inventories sent home heating oil prices to their highest in a decade.</p>
        <p>The surprising drop was reported in two surveys, one by the American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, and one by the United States Energy Information Administration, released yesterday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of crude oil for October delivery jumped 80 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $32.02 a barrel, while the price of heating oil for September delivery rose 5.26 cents, or 5.8 percent, to 95.61 cents a gallon.</p>
        <p>What this means for this winter is still hard to predict. But the average price of home heating oil this month is 52.5 percent more than it was in August 1999 and 23 percent above the average for last fall and winter. And although last fall and winter were warm by historical standards, the average cost of home heating oil, based on the futures price, was the third-highest since the winter of 1989-90 and missed being second highest by less than 0.2 cent.</p>
        <p>By examining some of the factors that will affect the price of crude oil and home heating oil, one can, at the least, get a sense of what will make for a really bad winter or where some relief -- in addition to more OPEC oil -- can come from.</p>
        <p>One way to do this is to look at the winter of 1996-97. That was the last time that distillate oil stocks, from which home heating oil is made, were even tighter than they are now. According to the American Petroleum Institute, there were 106.1 million barrels of distillate in inventory at this time in August 1996, compared with the current inventory of 111.1 million barrels.</p>
        <p>At this time in August 1996, the price of home heating oil was around 60 cents a gallon and on its way to a peak of 76.49 cents a gallon in October. That price was not surpassed until last winter, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries curtailed its production to push crude oil prices back up from lows of less than $11 a barrel to their highest levels since the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>A very cold fall in 1996 helped keep the price of home heating oil bouncing up back near the October high. According to the Northeast Regional Climate Center in Ithaca, N.Y., that fall in the Northeast was the 15th coldest since 1895.</p>
        <p>But the pressure was let off as the actual winter turned out to be one of the warmest ever, the 11th warmest, according to the Northeast Regional Climate Center. By the end of January, when the weather pattern was becoming apparent, the price of home heating oil began to plunge, falling as low as 52.54 cents a gallon on March 5, 1997.</p>
        <p>Still, that fall and winter had the second-highest average home heating futures price since 1989.</p>
        <p>If it is cold this fall, ''the price can go very high,'' said Irene King, the senior markets analyst at J. P. Morgan &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>She also said that the high cost of natural gas, which jumped 8.5 cents yesterday, to $4.605 per million British thermal units, will probably lead many companies that have the ability to do so to switch to distillates. That would put more pressure on heating oil supplies and prices. Natural gas inventories themselves are near six-year lows.</p>
        <p>Beyond the fall and winter weather and what happens to inventories in that time, the politics of the United State presidential election and the politics and production problems within OPEC will be the other big factors affecting how much it will cost to keep warm this winter.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration is again mentioning the possibility of using oil from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help push prices lower. And the connections of the Republican ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney to the oil industry will sharpen the focus on the issue this fall, especially if it is cold.</p>
        <p>Within OPEC, the key player, in terms of possible relief, is still Saudi Arabia, which pretty much went out on its own to pump more oil as oil prices rose earlier this summer. So far, strong demand has kept oil inventories surprisingly tight, offsetting the benefit of that extra production.</p>
        <p>Many oil analysts think that the rising price of crude oil, which is just below its decade high of $34.13, and heating oil will put added pressure on the OPEC members to agree to pump more oil when they meet in Vienna in early September.</p>
        <p>The members have already agreed on an informal trigger for the pumping of more oil: if crude oil stays above $30 a barrel for West Texas intermediate for 20 consecutive trading days.</p>
        <p>But oil politics could make OPEC members ignore this mechanism or work to get the price just below the trigger level just long enough to force the beginning of another 20-day period. One reason that many OPEC members are not interested in approving an increase in production is that they are already pumping at full capacity. Only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, oil analysts say, have the ability to increase their current production levels of crude oil.</p>
        <p>President Clinton said yesterday that he would discuss the high oil price this weekend when he meets with President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, a member of OPEC. In comments to reporters in Washington, Mr. Clinton indicated that he understood that capacity restraints within OPEC were a problem. ''We have to look at where there is excess capacity,'' he said, adding that ''this is a question of whether the OPEC nations can increase their production.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, ''I'm going to do what I can to keep these prices moderated and to continue to argue to all the OPEC nations that if the price gets too high they will cause recession.''</p>
        <p>''The oil price,'' he said, ''needs to be, I think, in the low $20's somewhere.''</p>
