        <p>LEVI STRAUSS is introducing a multimedia campaign to promote its Silvertab line of clothing, part of a continuing effort to stimulate steeply declining sales.</p>
        <p>Directed at young adults 18 to 22, the new campaign -- ''Lost but not lost'' -- follows the adventures of three young Americans traveling through Morocco. Eye-catching and exotic, the ads show the travelers on camels, in a beaten-up bus and on the beach wearing the new Silvertab line, which is made of ''high-tech materials'' like bonded fleece and oily canvas, and using Sony electronic equipment like a portable CD player and digital video camera.</p>

        <p>LEVI STRAUSS is introducing a multimedia campaign to promote its Silvertab line of clothing, part of a continuing effort to stimulate steeply declining sales.</p>
        <p>Directed at young adults 18 to 22, the new campaign -- ''Lost but not lost'' -- follows the adventures of three young Americans traveling through Morocco. Eye-catching and exotic, the ads show the travelers on camels, in a beaten-up bus and on the beach wearing the new Silvertab line, which is made of ''high-tech materials'' like bonded fleece and oily canvas, and using Sony electronic equipment like a portable CD player and digital video camera.</p>
        <p>Photographed by Albert Watson, who has collaborated with Levi Strauss since 1990, the new Silvertab advertising replaces a two-year-old campaign focused on people 15 to 19. The former campaign used illustrations to depict what the company called ''youth tribes'' with a ''blending of ethnicities.''</p>
        <p>Morocco was chosen as the setting for the new campaign ''because it's a place where there's little technology,'' said Sean Dee, director of marketing for the Levi's brand. ''It was a great way to showcase our product and introduce our positioning, which is that Silvertab is equipment for modern living.''</p>
        <p>Sony equipment is also featured because it ''helps us deliver on that premise,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''One of the key things that differentiates Silvertab from the Levi's brand is its positioning,'' Mr. Dee added. ''Silvertab is not what you expect from an old, reliable pair of Levi's. It allows us to expand what we offer the consumer.''</p>
        <p>Levi Strauss is employing both traditional and new media to promote the new Silvertab line. Print ads will run through December in magazines like Rolling Stone, Source, Spin, Vibe, GQ, Maxim and Jane. Postcards that reproduce images from these ads  will be distributed through the fall and early winter in restaurants in 15 cities nationwide, as well as in stores like Saks Fifth Avenue, Dillard's and J. C. Penney. Outdoor ads will also appear in Manhattan through the fall.</p>
        <p>In addition, Levi Strauss will introduce the Internet component of the campaign next month. It will tell the ''Lost but not lost'' story through various Web sites, including www.lostbutnotlost.com and www.sony.com. It has also created 15-second commercials for movie theaters to promote the Web campaign. Levi Strauss has also joined forces with imoviestudio.com, a site that brings visitors behind the scenes when films are made; Shockwave .com, a game and entertainment site; and Omnipod.com, a new company that makes multifunctional desktop software, to promote Silvertab online.</p>
        <p>Levi Strauss executives would not disclose the budget for the new campaign but said it would exceed previous spending. According to Competitive Media Reporting, Levi Strauss spent $5 million to promote Silvertab last year, $2 million in 1998 and $1 million in 1997.</p>
        <p>Levis Strauss is counting on advertising to help reverse a decline in sales. Overall sales for the company, which is privately held, dropped to $5.1 billion last year, down 28.2 percent from a peak of $7.1 billion in 1996. Sales also declined 6.4 percent in the second quarter of this year, compared with results in the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The new Silvertab campaign was created by by the San Francisco office of TWBA/Chiat/Day, whose new campaign for Levi's Red Tab jeans was introduced late last month. The agency is part of the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>Analysts who cover the apparel industry and youth market gave the new campaign mixed reviews.</p>
        <p>Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, called the campaign part of a ''near-desperate attempt by Levi's to change its image from dowdy to with it.''</p>
        <p>''The traditional Levi's product has come on hard times, and they're now beginning to realize that their salvation lies in addressing a completely new audience, college students and younger,'' he added. ''That's who they're apparently addressing now.''</p>
        <p>Harry Bernard, a partner in Colton Bernard Inc., a fashion consulting firm based in San Francisco, said that if Levi Strauss could make Silvertab work, ''the line will become more important than ever.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''It will be the fulcrum that brings them up over the top, if it becomes a desirable brand for the younger individual.''</p>
        <p>The advertising ''does the right thing, in terms of getting the target audience's attention, but it doesn't tell me that this is something I have to have,'' Mr. Bernard said.</p>
        <p>''They've got to take it another step beyond sheer imagery, focus on the product itself,'' he said. ''If a line doesn't have its own raison d'etre and identifiable signature, it isn't working. They're just beginning that process.''</p>
        <p>Irma Zandl, who runs a research firm in New York that tracks spending by consumers younger than 30, said the advertising had ''a very European sensibility; it looks very sophisticated, arty, aloof.''</p>
        <p>''It's so aloof and unengaging,'' she said, ''I doubt it will really connect with American teens and young adults.''</p>
