        <p>Garrett Mitchell wanted to be outside helping his mother load up the car for the last family vacation before school began. Instead he was inside at his computer, trying to finish his schoolwork.</p>
        <p>Like a growing number of students  throughout the nation, Garrett, who is 12 and entering the seventh grade,  has to worry not only about an increasing load of homework during the school year but about assignments that are due when he returns to school just after Labor Day.</p>
        <p>This summer, Garrett's marching orders came in a six-page packet. The assignments included reading the Declaration of Independence and answering nine questions about it (Who is the audience for the document? What role does the audience play?) and writing his own declaration for his class at the Renaissance School, a public middle school here. He also had to read a biography of a famous person (he picked Geronimo), prepare a two-page report on it and assemble an Indian costume to wear during a presentation sometime during the first two weeks of school.</p>
        <p>''A certain amount of homework in the summertime is good, but I would like it more if it was a little bit less,'' said Garrett, a lanky redhead, as he labored at the computer. ''I like school 10 times more than I like homework, but that's life.''</p>
        <p>Officials in the Montclair School District say all their junior and senior high school students should receive some sort of assignment during the summer to help them bridge the academic years, but the district leaves it up to individual schools and teachers to determine what the assignments will be. The summer homework is generally assigned by school officials, then graded in the fall by each student's new teacher.</p>
        <p>''It's good to keep kids focused and engaged,'' said Dr. Jeanne Pryor, the district's assistant superintendent in charge of instruction. ''The more work students do in the summertime, the less time they will need to review and refresh at the beginning of the school year.''</p>
        <p>But some education experts and parents say that schools, in their zeal to show that they are setting higher standards, are assigning too much homework, especially during the school year -- sometimes upward of four hours a night. They fear that when students are spending every waking hour -- and sometimes even losing sleep -- on schoolwork, there is little time for anything else, including family activities or hobbies.</p>
        <p>A recent study by the University of Michigan found that grade-school students, on average, spent more than two hours a night on homework during the school year, compared with 85 minutes in 1981.</p>
        <p>''I worry that too much homework kills that intrinsic desire in kids to learn and explore the world,'' said Katherine Schultz, assistant professor of education at Pennsylvania State University. ''It's not going to make it more likely for them to get into Yale or Harvard when they get more homework.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Schultz, who was a first-grade teacher for many years, said homework should serve as a ''bridge between home and school in a positive way.'' But, she said, it should not be so consuming that it creates a tension between overburdened students and parents who feel it is their duty to nag children about their work.</p>
        <p>''I don't think that kind of anxiety is productive,'' Dr. Schultz said.</p>
        <p>Louis Whipple knows all about that anxiety, especially during the summer. In Ms. Whipple's home in Montclair, her son Nicholas, 11, who will be in the seventh grade at Glenfield Middle School, and her daughter, Risa, 17, who will be a senior at Montclair High School, both have summer homework.</p>
        <p>''It's irritating all around,'' Ms. Whipple said. ''You spend so much time nagging and then rebutting the rebuttals to the nagging.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Whipple, who is the director of the Montclair Fund for Education, a nonprofit group that supports the public school system, said her son was participating in a program that requires him to read, in one year, 25 books; at least 15 must be read during the school year. But, she said, teachers gave little guidance about which types of books would be best for her son at his reading level, so  ''it's hard for me to help him put a structure in place.''</p>
        <p>''On the other hand,'' she said, ''he does have a great sense of accomplishment at the end of the summer when he completes all his reading.''</p>
        <p>Her daughter, Risa, also has summer homework that each year is tied to researching and reading about a  focused topic -- this year's is civics and government.</p>
        <p>Reading lists seem to be the most common summer assignment for many schools. Maggie Porycki, who will be a senior at the Marymount School of New York, a parochial school in Manhattan, had to read Shakespeare's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' and then pick two other books from a long list of fiction choices. She said the school made sure the students completed the readings, either by testing them on the plots of the books, or asking that they write essays or reviews when they return to school.</p>
        <p>''It's good because, me, I don't have a lot of time to read during the school year,'' Maggie said, explaining that her school assigns an average of four hours of homework a night during the year. ''If I didn't have it required, I probably wouldn't be reading this. I think it's good if you have a good choice of books.''</p>
        <p>In Mamaroneck in Westchester County, all schools require summer reading from a long list of titles that local bookstores and the public libraries keep so that students can easily obtain the books.</p>
        <p>Meredith Turtis, 13, who is entering the eighth grade in Hommocks Middle School there, is reading ''A Separate Peace'' and has already finished ''The Chosen.''</p>
        <p>''I think that kids should have freedom over the summer, but you really have to stay grounded in your studies, too,'' Meredith said. ''You're out of school for two months. You can't just avoid work completely. There's plenty of time to read.''</p>
        <p>But like Garrett and Maggie and probably many other students with summer homework, Meredith was still working on hers with the start of school just a couple of weeks away.</p>
        <p>''I procrastinate about books and homework,'' she said, ''but I get it done.''</p>
