        <p>When Lily Met Iris</p>
        <p>Q. Last fall, I bought some Pardancanda (orchid iris) plants. They have thrived and are stunningly beautiful, but I can't find any more. The tags said ''Pardancanda 'Dazzler Series' Candylily.'' Are they still available? Can they be divided, and if so, when? Any information about them would be welcome.</p>
        <p>A. Pardancanda norrisii is an iris-family flower child: created in the 1960's, more colorful than either of its parents, developed by an avid home gardener named Samuel Norris, who did it all for love. It took him a great many tries, but he finally mated a hybrid version of belamcanda, the old-fashioned blackberry lily, which always has purple-spotted orange flowers, with a lavender-flowered plant called Iris dichotoma (Pardanthopsis). The offspring had flowers in a whole paintbox of colors: pink, purple, yellow, orange, white and red, many of them spotted or with multicolor petals.</p>

        <p>A. Pardancanda norrisii is an iris-family flower child: created in the 1960's, more colorful than either of its parents, developed by an avid home gardener named Samuel Norris, who did it all for love. It took him a great many tries, but he finally mated a hybrid version of belamcanda, the old-fashioned blackberry lily, which always has purple-spotted orange flowers, with a lavender-flowered plant called Iris dichotoma (Pardanthopsis). The offspring had flowers in a whole paintbox of colors: pink, purple, yellow, orange, white and red, many of them spotted or with multicolor petals.</p>
        <p>Like those of belamcanda, pardancanda's flowers last only one day, but each plant produces lots of them, so the show lasts a month or more. And you still get the pretty clusters of shiny fruits that gave blackberry lilies their name.</p>
        <p>Pardancandas do best in bright sunshine, enjoy fairly heavy feeding and will, where happy, gradually form large clumps. These can be divided in late summer, after the foliage has started to turn yellow, or in early spring before the new growth starts.</p>
        <p>You can also raise new P. norrisii plants from seed, and get all sorts of interesting surprises. Dazzler, a hybrid available only as plants, is uniformly 15 to 18 inches tall, with flowers that start and stop at more or less the same time. Seed-grown pardancandas will vary from 10 inches to 3 feet, and they will bloom over a longer season because they won't all be ready at once.</p>
        <p>P. norrisii seed is available from Park Seed, 1 Parkton Avenue, Greenwood, S.C. 29647; (800) 845-3369; free catalog. Dazzler plants are produced by a wholesale nursery called Bluebird. Retailers may be found at its Web site, www.bluebirdnursery.com, or by mail from P.O. Box 460, Clarkson, Neb. 68629.</p>
        <p>How Not to Be Bored</p>
        <p>Q. The bulbs of my iris are being eaten by fat, white grubs over one inch long. Is there anything I can do, or should I replace the plants?</p>
        <p>A. There is a lot that you can do, and if you don't do it, there's no point in replacing the plants. The grubs are iris borers, a special bane of bearded iris. They will invade in force unless you take action.</p>
        <p>And they don't just eat. Sooner or later, they will open the way for soft rot, a foul-smelling bacterial infection, which kills more plants than borers do.</p>
        <p>Start by digging up the rhizomes and cutting out the borers. Discard badly damaged rhizomes. Before replanting the ones that are left, cut back leaf fans to three inches. Rake the soil to remove those borers that have left the plants to pupate in the ground. After pupating, the grubs' next move is to emerge in autumn as nondescript brown moths. They lay their eggs in dead iris leaves and other debris. So your next move is to wait until hard frost kills the moths, then remove every scrap of material that might harbor eggs.</p>
        <p>You will miss some, no matter what. In spring, they will hatch into tiny larvae, climb up the new iris leaves, then eat their way down toward the rhizomes from inside the leaf tissue. Watch for ragged edges, browning tips and little tunnels. Squeeze firmly at the lower end of the tunnels.</p>
        <p>Some experts advise killing borers biologically (with the microscopic worms called beneficial nematodes) or chemically (with strong systemic insecticides), but both of these methods require near-perfect timing and ideal conditions.</p>
        <p>In practice, the best control is the simplest, cheapest and least toxic: just clean up.</p>
