        <p>AT&amp;T expanded its relationship with FCB Worldwide in New York by naming the agency to handle the print work for a new corporate image campaign. The overall theme of the campaign will be coordinated with Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising in New York, the agency that originated the theme, and the agency that is handling the broadcast ads for the corporate account. Billings for the new campaign were estimated at $50 million. FCB and Y.&amp; R. are the two main roster agencies for AT&amp;T.</p>

        <p>AT&amp;T has bought an estimated $50 million in print and broadcast advertising for the Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, but it has not been determined whether AT&amp;T will use the purchase for the new campaign, for existing advertisements or sell it.</p>
        <p>FCB, part of True North Communications, also handles wireless and consumer ads for AT&amp;T, with overall billings estimated at $340 million. Y.&amp; R. handles corporate advertising, which has been inactive more than a year, as well as long-distance and some multicultural ads, with billings estimated at $300 million to $325 million; Media Edge in New York, a sibling agency of Y.&amp; R., handles all the media buying.</p>
