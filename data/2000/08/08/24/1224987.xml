        <p>WHAT had been a routinely sedate news media session suddenly became a raucous and family-like reunion yesterday when Cynthia Cooper bounded out the runway at Madison Square Garden, like a blazing Houston Comet across the New York sky.</p>
        <p>First the woman they call Coop hugged Sue Wicks, the veteran Liberty forward, once with feeling, a second time at a brassy cameraman's request. Then she decided, ''I've got to see Spoon,'' and went looking for Teresa Weatherspoon, bumping into Vickie Johnson first.</p>
        <p>''Oh, it's going to be a mistake when you retire,'' Johnson said, pulling Cooper close with both arms.</p>
        <p>''At least I get a chance to come a last time to Madison,'' Cooper said.</p>
        <p>Finally, she and the equally mercurial Weatherspoon began pawing at each other, just as when they were roommates on national teams and they would conduct killer push-up contests on hotel room carpets until even they had exhausted themselves to the brink of sleep.</p>
        <p>''I love her,'' Weatherspoon said, her body language affirming that this was no case of preening for the purpose of promotion.</p>
        <p>What history these women share, and we don't just mean the last four summers of toiling in David Stern's gender equity annex, otherwise known as the Women's National Basketball Association. Cooper's three-time champion Comets are at the Garden tonight to play the Liberty in the league's two-of-three finals for the third time, but telling the story of the W.N.B.A.'s most dominant player from 1997 on would be like starting an American history text at World War II.</p>
        <p>Besides her long friendship with Weatherspoon, the braided Miss Liberty, Cooper played alongside Tari Phillips and against Wicks in the Italian league that so many American women had to call home, away from home. And while summer prime time in the big-boy arenas was much too long in coming, those were the days, Wicks could tell you, that Cynthia Cooper was a sight to behold.</p>
        <p>''She got all the points,'' said Wicks, going all the way back to the late-1980's. ''It was like Michael Jordan early on -- extraordinary, amazing. When I played against her, I would just stand in the back of the zone, waiting for her to blow by everyone, and just try to take a swipe at her. Take 10 swipes, maybe get one.</p>
        <p>''Now she's more efficient, good at getting everyone involved, saving her energy. She's more like Jordan at the end of his career.''</p>
        <p>Everyone finishes up sooner or later, but few could understand why the 5-foot-10-inch dynamo announced on July 4 that she had decided to retire after this season, while still one of the league's very best. She spent the ensuing days testily denying her decision was related to displeasure voiced earlier about losing shots to Sheryl Swoopes, among others.</p>
        <p>The pettiness exists even on teams that win the championship every season, not just those perennial also-rans with Patrick Ewing occupying the paint. The Comets, to their credit, managed to move past or adapt to their internal strife, and returned to the finals.</p>
        <p>''Whatever happens in the locker room doesn't matter,'' Weatherspoon argued. ''I've always said, 'You don't have to like me, just play basketball with me.' ''</p>
        <p>While that sounded like sensible advice in the event the Knicks can't unload the ever-alienated Ewing, Cooper was sticking with her own departure script yesterday, saying it didn't matter if anyone believed or understood her.</p>
        <p>''I've had four years here, the experience that passed over some others,'' she said. ''It didn't pass over me.''</p>
        <p>It is understandable why the American public and press might believe women's basketball began with Stern's hip marketing, with ''We Got Next.'' But Cooper is 37, has played professionally for as long as Ewing and has logged more trans-Atlantic miles than Lindbergh could have dreamed.</p>
        <p>''Maybe she feels it's time,'' Weatherspoon said. ''If I had to tell her, I would tell her it's not. But a lot of people have no idea what she's already put into it.''</p>
        <p>Cooper has made decent money and speaks four languages but along the way lost a brother to the streets, her mother to breast cancer and her teammate and close friend, Kim Perrot, to brain cancer last summer.</p>
        <p>She knows the difference between substance and show, though game and life do occasionally mix. A year ago this month, Cooper dedicated a night to Perrot, and scored 42 points. That's a flair for the dramatic we expected from another basketball great. If this really is Cooper's farewell, no one in her extended family will be shocked if she goes out the way Jordan did, too.</p>
