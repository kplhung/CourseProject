        <p>Yesterday's draw for the United States Open generated more speculation about the future than about the first round. Top-seeded Andre Agassi, the defending champion, and No. 4 Pete Sampras might meet in the semifinals; Serena Williams, the women's defending champion, and her sister Venus, the hottest player in the sport, are in opposite halves of the draw and could only meet in the final.</p>
        <p>But things could get interesting long before then. Pat Rafter, the two-time Open champion and the most dangerous unseeded player, might meet 15th-seeded Mark Philippoussis in the third round. Philippoussis could face Jan-Michael Gambill in the second round.</p>

        <p>Yesterday's draw for the United States Open generated more speculation about the future than about the first round. Top-seeded Andre Agassi, the defending champion, and No. 4 Pete Sampras might meet in the semifinals; Serena Williams, the women's defending champion, and her sister Venus, the hottest player in the sport, are in opposite halves of the draw and could only meet in the final.</p>
        <p>But things could get interesting long before then. Pat Rafter, the two-time Open champion and the most dangerous unseeded player, might meet 15th-seeded Mark Philippoussis in the third round. Philippoussis could face Jan-Michael Gambill in the second round.</p>
        <p>No. 11 Tim Henman could face the second-most feared floater, Richard Krajicek, in the third round. Agassi could face one of two talented players, Hicham Arazi or Wayne Ferreira, in the third round.</p>
        <p>A few-round matches are noteworthy. No. 7 Conchita Martinez will face Amy Frazier, a semifinalist at the Acura Classic near San Diego. Mary Pierce, the French Open champion now struggling with a shoulder injury, goes against Alexandra Stevenson, who reached the Wimbledon semifinals last year. Two rounds later, the winner of that match could face the the serve-and-volleyer Lisa Raymond, who should be motivated after being left off the United States Olympics team.</p>
        <p>No. 1 Martina Hingis and No. 3 Venus Williams anchor the top half of the women's draw. With Amelie Mauresmo out with an injury, 18th-ranked Chanda Rubin just missed being seeded and is a potential third-round opponent for Monica Seles, seeded sixth. Seles's projected fourth-round opponent is No. 15 Jennifer Capriati, the player she outlasted in an epic Open semifinal in 1991.</p>
        <p>In the bottom half, No. 2 Lindsay Davenport is seeded to meet No. 5 Serena Williams in the quarterfinals and Pierce in the semifinals.</p>
