        <p>A SOCCER game lasts 90 minutes, but the global passion for the sport is never governed by the clock. And it's a good thing, because watching a European match on American television usually means staying up very late or getting up very, very early.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the mainstream news media cover only the big events, like the men's and women's World Cup. Other than a pilgrimage to Old Trafford, the soccer stadium in Manchester, England, to see a Manchester United match or to Nou Camp in Spain to see F. C. Barcelona, perhaps the best way to slake the obsession for soccer is on the Internet.</p>

        <p>A SOCCER game lasts 90 minutes, but the global passion for the sport is never governed by the clock. And it's a good thing, because watching a European match on American television usually means staying up very late or getting up very, very early.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the mainstream news media cover only the big events, like the men's and women's World Cup. Other than a pilgrimage to Old Trafford, the soccer stadium in Manchester, England, to see a Manchester United match or to Nou Camp in Spain to see F. C. Barcelona, perhaps the best way to slake the obsession for soccer is on the Internet.</p>
        <p>The Internet is emerging as the talk radio of soccer, providing statistics, chat rooms and Web sites dedicated to individual players.</p>
        <p>Staying current with European and other results from around the world once meant tuning in the crackly and elusive signals of a shortwave radio. Now it is more likely that soccer aficionados marooned on these shores can tune to matches on the Internet via streaming audio.</p>
        <p>Broadcast.com from Yahoo offers live matches, but only from a handful of teams in Italy (A. C. Milan, Juventus and Parma) and Britain (Manchester United, Arsenal, Derby County and Glasgow Celtic). Internetsoccer.com takes a more local approach, broadcasting the regional World Cup qualifying matches now being played by the United States.</p>
        <p>Most European club teams have official (and many, many unofficial) Web sites, some of which, like Paris Saint-Germain (www.psg.fr), also offer an English version. In general, the sites have a club's history, schedules, news releases, player roster and, of course, merchandise (most European clubs have the nasty habit of changing their uniform style every season).</p>
        <p>Another excellent way to follow a match (whether it is a regular league game on the weekend or a match in continental cup competition) in real time is with the Match Tracker. It is used at the official Web sites of two of the most famous European clubs: Manchester United (manutd.com) and Barcelona (fcbarcelona.com).</p>
        <p>Launching Match Tracker calls up  a window on the screen that will give you a second-by-second, text-based play-by-play of the match, including statistics, lineups (with player pictures and information) and an audio link (if the match is being broadcast over the Internet). It is probably the closest you can get to the match without actually being there.</p>
        <p>A straight tickertape of scores can be found at Livescore.com. There, you can follow matches in 18 European countries as well as continental and international cup competitions like the European Champions League, the U.E.F.A. Cup and qualifying matches leading up to the 2002 World Cup finals in South Korea and Japan. Scores are updated every few minutes. A small flashing green square denotes a match in progress, and there is also a notation of how much time has elapsed in the match. When a match ends, the site provides a link to a news service report about the match.</p>
        <p>As more young American players like Landon Donovan (on the Bayer Leverkusen team in Germany), Joe-Max Moore (Everton in England) and Claudio Reyna (Glagow Rangers in Scotland) seek fame (but mostly fortune) playing soccer in Europe, the Internet has made it possible, even easy, to follow their weekly performances.</p>
        <p>The site with the most extensive information on Americans playing overseas is Soccerspot.com. The site's research is now being picked up and distributed by the United States Soccer Federation (on its Web site, www.us-soccer.com, and via e-mail messages) and ESPN.com.</p>
        <p>Video broadcasts on the Web are probably still a couple of years away, but soccer fans can use the Internet to find listings of soccer on TV (primarily satellite TV) by checking out the listings at Soccertv.com.</p>
