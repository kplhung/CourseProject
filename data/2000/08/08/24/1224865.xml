        <p>The story of Moses isn't usually sung and danced by a cast of African-Americans and Jews. Nor is it performed as a work in progress with new casts at every performance. Yet this has been one of the goals of Walter Robinson, a composer from Cambridge, Mass., who has spent the last four years piecing together ''Moses,'' which  through black music and dance tells the Old Testament story of the liberation of the Israelites from slavery.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of blacks and Jews, from professional singers to children in choirs, have contributed to ''Moses,'' which has had about two dozen performances in synagogues, churches and theaters along the East Coast. Question-and-answer sessions usually follow.</p>
        <p>On one recent evening in the basement of Temple Israel in Boston, a cantor in the show chanted a lament for the suffering of the Israelite slaves. Three gospel singers sang backup. Soon afterward an Israelite slave broke into a rap harangue.  Pharaoh's magicians engaged in a break-dance battle. By the time a jazz trio crooned a seductive entreaty to build a golden calf, the audience and performers were swaying  with the rhythms of a Southern Baptist church.</p>
        <p>''The story of Moses is a universal story, with the universal themes of freedom, liberation -- leaving the familiar and going toward the unknown,'' said Mr. Robinson. ''Yet there is also something universal about black music.''</p>
        <p>His audiences seem to enjoy and understand it. ''It was a real thrill to look out and see young people tapping their feet and clapping their hands,'' said Nancy K. Kaufman, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston, who has been both a narrator and fund-raiser for the show. True, the black teenagers in the audience were a little more zealous in their participation, she said, ''but the Jews were holding their own.''</p>
        <p>Betty Cohen, the cantor at Temple Emanu-El in Long Beach, N.Y., said the crowd that turned out for a show there in June was second only to attendance for the High Holy Days.</p>
        <p>The show rarely plays the same way twice. Those who saw it in March at the Emerson Majestic Theater in Boston witnessed it at its grandest, a musical spectacle with dancers, a full band and a 100-voice children's choir. More often the performances are pared down, with  street-clothes workshops for schools and community groups.</p>
        <p>Many of the principal performers are black, but children from local synagogues make up the choir and a female cantor usually plays Moses' wife, Zipporah. At a workshop performance in July, Rebecca Garfein, senior cantor at Congregation Rodeph Sholom in New York City, sang ''I Feel Love Here'' with Don Corey Washington, a professional singer from East Orange, N.J.</p>
        <p>There have been difficulties. Some people complained that there were not enough Hebrew lyrics in the show, or that the nonblack parts seemed more ''white'' than Jewish in their emphasis. Others said that all  the main characters should have been played by black performers and that Mr. Robinson played favorites in selecting performers instead of holding general auditions. In response Mr. Robinson has tweaked the script, although he points out that the show is intended to be a black retelling of the story of Moses, not an amalgam of Jewish and black music.  He says that casting will be less personal once he has a producer. ''That, I want to be a much wider process than myself,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson chooses his venues carefully to avoid neighborhoods where Jews or blacks might feel intimidated. ''Unfortunately, over time, everyone has become so separate, that they have built a sort of fear reference to certain communities,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The suggestion for a musical about Moses, Mr. Robinson said, came from Leonard Zakim, longtime regional director of the Anti-Defamation League in Boston. But it was a performance of the show ''Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk'' that inspired Mr. Robinson to create the format and feel of his show. What that show did with dance, he said, he knew he wanted to do with music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson credits his grandfather, who took him to Southern Baptist church services as a child, for acquainting him with the spiritual nature of music. ''Everyone would get on their knees when they prayed,'' he said. ''I would be there huddled next to my grandfather and all these big, sweaty people would be moaning in prayer, and all these wonderful melodies reaching out to God. It was just really, really powerful.''</p>
        <p>He went on to worship with a variety of Christian groups, from Baptists to Pentacostal to Charismatic Catholics, some of whom denounced other denominations in their prayers, leaving him pained, he said.</p>
        <p>After touring with Livingston Taylor as a bassist, he spent eight years as a fellow at the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute of African-American Research at Harvard, where he wrote an opera about a slave who bought his own freedom, ''Look What a Wonder Jesus Has Done.'' His folk song ''Harriet Tubman'' is a staple of school choirs.</p>
        <p>But it was a grant from the Meet the Composer Foundation and community sponsors in 1995 that set the ''Moses'' project rolling. To the gospel, jazz and choral pieces he wrote, Mr. Robinson added rap songs and break dancing by a troupe called the FloorLords. In the show, a cadre of step dancers portray midwives who defy the Pharaoh's orders to kill the first-born male Hebrew children. ''We will not do it!'' they sing, echoing their words with their stamping feet.</p>
        <p>The showman in Mr. Robinson longs to see his music make it to Broadway, with star-quality performers and perhaps a technologically dazzling burning bush. He has the ear of major black dance and theater companies who may help it get there, he said. In 1998 he received  a grant for $35,000 from Steven Spielberg's Righteous Persons Foundation and in December 1999, a matching grant from that organization for $50,000.</p>
        <p>When the Tanglewood Festival Chorus performed ''The Ten Commandments,'' a classical choral piece from the show, ''I was immensely impressed and grateful and felt proud,'' he said. ''But it's no less than when I go to a synagogue and see the kids struggle and miss a line. Right now I'm blessed with both opportunities.''</p>
        <p>And so he seemed as he scrutinized the jazz trio's rendering of ''Bring Your Gold Together,'' in which the wandering Israelites decide to hedge their bets with the old Egyptian gods by building an idol. ''You know, having a god we can see,'' they croon, ''eliminates anxiety.''</p>
