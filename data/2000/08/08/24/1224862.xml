        <p>Jennifer Dunning reviews performance by Daniel Gwirtzman, formerly known as Disco Danny, and troupe of 13 dancers in 10-piece program, at Flea Theater (S)</p>

        <p>Daniel Gwirtzman has an unusually long, supple body and the kind of infectious delight in performing one might expect from a former disco dancer. Mr. Gwirtzman, once known as Disco Danny, assembled a company of 13 engaging dancers for ''Summer Fever,'' performed on Friday night at the Flea Theater. But that was not enough to overcome the essential blandness of the program's 10 pieces, which often looked as if they had been created simply for the pleasure of making another dance and not because of an unignorable idea or piece of music.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem was the staging, which merged the pieces into one long flow of dance with interludes that served to get the dancers on and off the stage in ways that were sometimes ingenious but otherwise hokey. Mr. Gwirtzman used his 10 female dancers as a harem in too many of the pieces, but he is a much better comic performer than homme fatal.</p>

        <p>Daniel Gwirtzman has an unusually long, supple body and the kind of infectious delight in performing one might expect from a former disco dancer. Mr. Gwirtzman, once known as Disco Danny, assembled a company of 13 engaging dancers for ''Summer Fever,'' performed on Friday night at the Flea Theater. But that was not enough to overcome the essential blandness of the program's 10 pieces, which often looked as if they had been created simply for the pleasure of making another dance and not because of an unignorable idea or piece of music.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem was the staging, which merged the pieces into one long flow of dance with interludes that served to get the dancers on and off the stage in ways that were sometimes ingenious but otherwise hokey. Mr. Gwirtzman used his 10 female dancers as a harem in too many of the pieces, but he is a much better comic performer than homme fatal.</p>
        <p>The two most accomplished pieces of choreography were the new ''Go,'' set to music by Celia Cruz, and the recent ''Obsession,'' to music by Soledad. Both were performed by Mr. Gwirtzman and Cary McWilliam, a dancer of special warmth and graciousness. In ''Current'' the two moved in a cascade of fast, precise footwork, suggesting a latter-day interpretation of the formal art of ballroom dancing. ''Obsession'' looked, intriguingly, like deconstructed flamenco dancing.</p>
        <p>The company was completed by Satomi Shikata, Lindsey Dietz, Jason Marchant, Grissell Suhy, Gail Giovanniello, Oren Bar-Noy, Claire Malaquias, Sarah Galender, Malene Schjonning, Caron Eule and Melissa Edwards. ''Summer Fever'' will be performed through Saturday at the Flea (41 White Street, TriBeCa).</p>
