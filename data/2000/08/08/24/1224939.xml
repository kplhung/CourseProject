        <p>When Jason Sehorn is out with his fiancee, the television actress Angie Harmon, he knows what to expect when fans recognize the couple.</p>
        <p>''They'll run to her and start talking about 'Law and Order,' '' Sehorn said this week, referring to the weekly NBC drama in which Harmon stars. ''And eventually, they'll kind of look over at me and say: 'Oh, and there's that football guy.' ''</p>
        <p>Sehorn smiled as he told the story, understanding that there is almost something droll or paradoxical about such an anecdote, and not because his wife-to-be's celebrity exceeds his own.</p>
        <p>''If I'm going to take second fiddle to someone, I'm going to take second fiddle to my wife,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Sehorn met Harmon because his own mother, Nancy, was star-struck when she came upon Harmon standing outside Giants Stadium after the Giants' opening game last season. She approached Harmon, her son the cornerback in tow. Sehorn and Harmon began dating a week later.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to compete with my spouse,'' said Sehorn, who plans to marry Harmon next June. ''That's not the problem.''</p>
        <p>No, there's a more pertinent twist: if only Sehorn could get more people to think of him as ''that football guy.''</p>
        <p>To some, the omnipresent Sehorn, who is easily the Giants' most popular player, has become best known for everything but being a football player -- particularly since he sat out most of the last two seasons with three serious leg injuries.</p>
        <p>Telegenic, well-spoken and accessible, Sehorn has been a broadcaster, endorsed a host of prominent products and charities, performed a few cameos on television shows, posed for fashion magazines, and of course, proposed to Harmon in front of the nation on ''The Tonight Show.''</p>
        <p>That football guy, meanwhile, has played 10 games in the last 32 months. Preparing for his first season-opening game in three years, against Arizona on Sept. 3, Sehorn, who is 29 and in his seventh N.F.L. season, is approaching a crossroads, and knows it.</p>
        <p>''People have a lot of questions about me,'' Sehorn said. ''I want to help answer them. The facts are that my personal life, which was unsettled for quite a while, now makes me happier than I've ever been. I've been here working out with the team all winter, all spring and all summer. I can run as fast and jump as high as I used to. There are tests to measure that.</p>
        <p>''I'm not fooling myself and saying I'm the same player I was, because I'm not. I don't have that swagger I used to have. I used to walk out and say, 'You're not catching a pass today.' But everybody always wants to know if I'm going to be the same. I tell them, 'I hope so.' But what I want to say is, 'In time, I will be the same.' Because I feel it coming back.''</p>
        <p>Spend time with Sehorn and it becomes obvious just how regularly, hour by hour, day by day, he is confronted by the distinction of his football past. At the Giants' training camp in Albany earlier this month, Sehorn would spend 30 minutes to an hour daily signing autographs for fans -- many of them wearing his No. 31 jersey -- and every minute or so he would be asked: Are you going to get back to the way you were?</p>
        <p>When he was done with the fans, reporters would ask a similar question: Can you again be the player you were in 1997?</p>
        <p>That year finished a two-season sequence in which Sehorn had 4 1/2 sacks and 11 interceptions, elevating him to the ranks of elite cornerbacks.</p>
        <p>Standing in the shade outside the Giants' locker room after a recent practice -- that most fitting question probably still ringing in his ears after his usual autograph session -- Sehorn was reminded of his acrobatic interception and 36-yard return in the Giants' last game of the 1997 season, the heart-breaking playoff loss to Minnesota.</p>
        <p>The play is still shown often as a highlight on football broadcasts, a series of graceful yet athletic moves, ballet-like with a football gridiron for a stage, and it serves as an ensemble of the gifts Sehorn once displayed.</p>
        <p>Turning in midair to intercept the ball, Sehorn landed on one foot, then reached down to brace himself with one hand, all while purposely and completely eluding the intended receiver, Cris Carter, to avoid a pass interference penalty. Sehorn then gathered the ball in and instantly reversed direction to weave up the field through seven Vikings before he was finally tackled.</p>
        <p>With that play in mind, Sehorn was asked yet again: Will Giants fans ever see that Sehorn again?</p>
        <p>''I could still do it physically,'' he answered. ''But will I be in position to leap up and grab it? That's the question. When I did that, I was coming off four straight N.F.L. seasons with four straight training camps and hundreds of practices under my belt. I knew instinctively, without thinking about it, how to put myself in position to make that play.</p>
        <p>''That's the difference. I can still do it. But have I played enough football, practiced enough football, to be in the right position? It's getting there. I had something like 28 practices all of last season. I've gone way past 28 practices already this year.''</p>
        <p>As for the idea that he has been distracted by his off-the-field interests and activities, Sehorn called the notion weird.</p>
        <p>''Why the speculation about that?'' he asked. ''Where's the concern? Are you concerned or are you just bored and want to criticize someone? It's not like I missed one game or one practice or one rehab session. I didn't ask for time off, I had reconstructive knee surgery and a broken leg.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't play football and I took advantage of every opportunity. Football is an ability I have that is fleeting. I have other goals for my life.''</p>
        <p>Still, this spring, when the Giants convened for a three-day minicamp, Sehorn occasionally looked indifferent, or heedless in his coverage of Giants wide receivers. John Fox, the defensive coordinator, took him aside and reminded Sehorn that practice mattered, that the team's star cornerback could not set an example with less than his best at all times.</p>
        <p>Sehorn agreed and has had a far more impressive preseason, though he did give up a touchdown pass against the Jets last week.</p>
        <p>''Another mental lapse,'' Sehorn said of the touchdown. ''Exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about -- I needed to be in better position to make the right play.''</p>
        <p>Fox said he believes Sehorn will make it all the way back to his 1997 form. ''I was just starting to see that when he broke his leg last December,'' Fox said. ''I was just starting to tell people, 'Jason is back.' ''</p>
        <p>Sehorn broke his leg during a game against the Jets last December, ending his season. Sixteen months earlier in a preseason game against the Jets, he tore two knee ligaments returning a game-opening kickoff.</p>
        <p>Sehorn's absence has done little to stem his popularity with Giants fans. At the concession stands at Giants training camp, there were five uniform numbers for sale, but only one, No. 31, available in three colors: white, blue and red. And the combination of Sehorn jerseys outsold all others by more than 2-1. Sehorn shrugged when asked about why he is such a fan favorite.</p>
        <p>''Well, I just spent 35 or 40 minutes signing autographs and talking to people,'' he said. ''I talk to people all the time. I'm in no rush to get to the locker room. Why? There are 30 kids out there with my jersey on. I can't walk past them. I do the same thing on the street.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a bad guy. I stay clear of the law. I stay clear of bad things. Do I smile a lot? Yeah, I do. My mom taught me that being a good person is more important than a career. I remember that.''</p>
        <p>He concedes he is naturally comfortable in the spotlight, and with Harmon by his side many an evening, getting more and more exposed to it.</p>
        <p>''I have a privileged life,'' Sehorn said. ''But what am I apologizing for? I am spending time with the person I am most comfortable with and enjoy more than anyone else. But people should know that they can count on me when it comes time to compete.</p>
        <p>''Maybe a football player isn't who I am, but it's what I do. And in practice all week, in meetings and especially on Sunday, that's all I do.''</p>
