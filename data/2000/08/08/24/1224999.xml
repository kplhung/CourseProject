        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>One of the pleasures of belonging to a small, tech-minded Internet Service Provider is that the user usually has access to a much wider variety of services than the larger I.S.P.'s offer, like Unix shell access (''In Praise of the Mom-and-Pop I.S.P.,'' Aug. 17). The recent decision by Mindspring to take shell access away from its (formerly Netcom) customers has led to a stampede to the small I.S.P.'s that still offer Telnet access via a command-line interface.</p>

        <p>It would have been nice, in a New York paper, to see some references to local mom-and-pop I.S.P.'s, and New York is a good town for it. One of them, Panix.com, was one of the first companies to offer Internet services to the public. And Bway.net offers a variety of services, including shell access, to its customers. They may be a little more expensive than the ''six months free'' sales campaigns of AOL and MSN -- but then, you get what you pay for, don't you?</p>
