        <p>I AM looking for a piano lamp that has a long arm that you can adjust to cast really strong light on sheet music. The lamp has to be small enough to fit on a small shelf, and it should not tip over and fall onto the floor constantly like the last one (which broke). Also, it cannot be ugly.</p>

        <p>I AM looking for a piano lamp that has a long arm that you can adjust to cast really strong light on sheet music. The lamp has to be small enough to fit on a small shelf, and it should not tip over and fall onto the floor constantly like the last one (which broke). Also, it cannot be ugly.</p>
        <p>Is that too much to ask?</p>
        <p>For a long time, I thought the answer was yes.</p>
        <p>In search of leads, I scoured all my usual haunts, including lighting stores and antique stores, yard sales and thrift shops, and the home of some friends who were out of town. (Entry was legal; they had asked me to take in the mail.)</p>
        <p>I tried online search engines, too. But although you can quickly hunt down certain kinds of products on the Internet -- books and CD's, for example -- simply by entering a title in a query box, you are less likely to succeed with more idiosyncratic requests.</p>
        <p>My favorite search engine, Google, laughed at my request: ''Your search, 'small piano lamp that casts good light,' did not match any documents.'' And Ask Jeeves responded to my question as if it were one of my children trying to avoid telling me who left the car door open in the rain. (''Umm, Mom, I don't know, but would you like to look at this cool Web site that has information about the movie 'The Piano'?'')</p>
        <p>So after the old lamp broke, I just swept up the broken light bulb and told my daughters to squint through ''Fur Elise'' until further notice.</p>
        <p>Then one day last week I heard about a free shopping service called Respond.com, where shoppers can type in the most idiosyncratic, finicky words they can think of to describe the specific product or service they want (www.respond.com).</p>
        <p>''If you would have an easier time finding what you are looking for if you could say it in your own words to a lot of people all at once, then it could be helpful to use Respond,'' said Will Clemens, Respond.com's chief executive.</p>
        <p>Respond.com acts as a liaison between shoppers and merchants. It protects shoppers' anonymity while it forwards requests via e-mail messages to more than 70,000 merchants selling items in more than 4,000 categories, like bicycle components and fresh mussels.</p>
        <p>Respond.com is paid for leads by both big and small merchants, like Lands' End, Annie's Costume and Magic, and ABT Electronics.</p>
        <p>Sellers reply by e-mail message to Respond.com if they think they can fulfill a request, and Respond.com forwards the responses to the shopper. If a lead looks promising, the shopper can get in touch with a seller to ask questions, negotiate or make a purchase.</p>
        <p>The service was simple and easy to use. At the top of the home page was a query box that prompted me to finish the phrase ''I'm looking for . . .''</p>
        <p>For some reason, the suggestive ellipses made me think of the Miss America personality test, in which contestants are asked to reveal their deepest desires.</p>
        <p>Momentarily carried away, I tried to type, ''I'm looking for world peace, or at least a scholarship and free use of a convertible for the next year,'' but that turned out to be too many characters for the search function to handle.</p>
        <p>Luckily, ''I'm looking for a small piano lamp that casts good light,'' fit just fine. After I clicked on ''Go!'' the site offered me a choice of a couple of dozen categories to search, including Antique Lamps and Lights, Desk Lamps and Wall Lamps. I chose the Antique Lamps and Lights category, then typed a detailed description of my dream lamp and set a one-week deadline for replies.</p>
        <p>Just sending such a specific request made me feel so powerful that I started to remember other hard-to-find items that have eluded me. So I filed five more requests, for things like ''a hotel in Miami with a big, free-form swimming pool that will entertain children all day,'' ''a free-standing bamboo magazine rack to sit next to an armchair,'' ''old cookbooks from the first half of the 20th century'' and ''biographical information about the author Louise Dickinson Rich.''</p>
        <p>Within a day, I had received at least one response to each request (after three days, the most I received was three, from online travel agents who offered to help me book a trip to Miami).</p>
        <p>Some responses to queries for books, for instance, came from individual booksellers and turned out to be less comprehensive than if I had simply used a specialized search engine like Bookfinder.com to look for the same material.</p>
        <p>But responses to my quirkier requests offered good leads. Some of the best, in fact, came from Respond.com's customer service staff, which sends e-mail responses to queries in categories where Respond.com has fewer merchant partners (to ensure that shoppers get at least one response within 72 hours).</p>
        <p>The staff will hunt through databases of previous requests and, if necessary, conduct a Web search to find promising online retailers' sites. Although I could have done such a search myself, I was happy to sit back and let them do the work.</p>
        <p>That's how I learned about Tuthilllighting.com, the informational Internet site (www.Tuthilllighting .com) of a company that sells piano lamps, including a model that clips onto a music rack. On the company's Web site, I also happened to notice a battery-operated, wall-mounted picture lamp, which had no messy cord to dangle down behind a picture frame. That reminded me that I had been looking for months for two of those, too. Although Tuthilllighting.com doesn't sell products online, the Web site referred me to a local retailer, N &amp; S Dcor Fixture on Long Island.</p>
        <p>I phoned N &amp; S to get prices, discuss bulb requirements and ask what the finish ''statuary bronze'' could possibly look like. Over the phone, the clerk told me that the piano lamp had a cord (messy, now that I had seen the cordless picture lamp) and cost $240 (yechh).</p>
        <p>To make the visit to Respond.com worth the effort, I ordered the picture lamp. Downstairs, I heard someone stumbling over ''Ode to Joy'' in bad light.</p>
