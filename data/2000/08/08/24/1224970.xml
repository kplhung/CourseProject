        <p>A rotator-cuff injury once knocked out Lindsay Lee-Waters at the height of her career. She isn't about to let being nearly five months pregnant stop her.</p>
        <p>Lee-Waters, 23, is due to deliver a girl in early January, but she is squeezing in one last tournament. She was to have played Na Li yesterday in the first round of the United States Open qualifying, but rain washed away her match and several others at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Lee-Waters will play the match today, needing three rounds to advance to the Open, which begins Monday.</p>

        <p>A rotator-cuff injury once knocked out Lindsay Lee-Waters at the height of her career. She isn't about to let being nearly five months pregnant stop her.</p>
        <p>Lee-Waters, 23, is due to deliver a girl in early January, but she is squeezing in one last tournament. She was to have played Na Li yesterday in the first round of the United States Open qualifying, but rain washed away her match and several others at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Lee-Waters will play the match today, needing three rounds to advance to the Open, which begins Monday.</p>
        <p>Lee-Waters's playing at such an advanced stage of pregnancy is noteworthy but not precedent-setting. Tami Witlinger-Jones was three and a half months pregnant when she lost to Martina Hingis in the first round of the Open in 1997 and then retired.</p>
        <p>''It really affected my movement,'' Jones said by phone yesterday. ''I was substantially slower and my reaction to the ball was slower.''</p>
        <p>Lee-Waters has gained 10 pounds and expects her weight to increase rapidly in the coming months. She said she was feeling better and fitter now after taking time off back home in Atlanta because of morning sickness. This is the last competition that doctors have cleared her to play in before the birth.</p>
        <p>''I got in on my ranking and the money's good, and it's a good finishing to the year,'' Lee-Waters said. ''It's nothing really to prove. I can play and I want to play.''</p>
        <p>Ranked 243rd, Lee-Waters received $3,000 for making the qualifying and could earn up to $10,000 if she makes it to the Open.</p>
        <p>The pregnancy was not planned. Lee-Waters has been on a mission to return to her form in 1995, when she upset Pam Shriver in the first round of Wimbledon and then reached a career-high ranking of 36th in 1996.</p>
        <p>Shoulder problems and a biceps tendon injury have relegated her to satellite tournaments in recent years. Now fully healed, Lee-Waters was encouraged by her 19-6 match record this season.</p>
        <p>''This year would have been a really good year if this hadn't happened, but I think there's a reason for everything,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Lee-Waters, a 5-foot-7-inch right-hander with a two-fisted backhand, said her strokes have to be solid because of her decreased quickness. She will not dive for balls but she will stretch for them. And she will take more time between points to get her wind back.</p>
        <p>Lee-Waters doubted that her opponents would take it easy on her with a Grand Slam entry on the line. And she certainly will not go easy on herself. She plans to take a month off after the birth and then resume training.</p>
        <p>''I'm young enough and I can still do some damage on the tour,'' she said.</p>
