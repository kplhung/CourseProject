        <p>About 50 of the airline's 10,000 mechanics have been working overtime this week in Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington and Indianapolis to try to make sure that flights take off on time, said a United spokesman, Chris Brathwaite.

        <p>To help overcome delays and cancellations that have plagued it this summer, United Airlines has issued an order requiring mechanics at five airports to work overtime if asked.</p>
        <p>About 50 of the airline's 10,000 mechanics have been working overtime this week in Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington and Indianapolis to try to make sure that flights take off on time, said a United spokesman, Chris Brathwaite. An order, called an operational emergency, was also issued in Denver, but no mechanics have been asked to work overtime there, Mr. Brathwaite said.</p>
        <p>The contract between United's parent company, UAL Corporation, and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union allows management to declare an operational emergency when overtime hours are needed to keep the airline operating efficiently. United and union spokesmen said the airline does not often issue such an order.</p>
        <p>''We have planes backed up, we have out-of-service aircraft which are causing cancellations, and we're calling a few mechanics in to service the aircraft to keep them running on time,'' Mr. Brathwaite said, adding that those working overtime were the most junior mechanics. ''If it takes an extra hour for somebody to work to fix a doorknob or a broken seat, we need to make sure our planes are in good working order.''</p>
        <p>Frank Larkin, a spokesman for the machinists union, said United officials reported in a conference call today that ''they had as many as 40 aircraft out of service, grounded and they were going to be using mandatory overtime only as long as was needed to correct the situation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Larkin added: ''Emergency overtime is permitted in our contract. The concern now is that it does not go from an actual emergency to covering staffing needs. In this conference call the company said it would use it as little as possible. Nevertheless we feel it has the potential to do long-term damage.''</p>
        <p>United has been plagued by thousands of cancellations and delays since the contract with its pilots expired in April. Few of the pilots have been willing to work overtime and their contract does not allow United to require them to do so.</p>
        <p>Since July, when a contract with the mechanics expired, the airline has reported an increase in maintenance delays. United is seeking disciplinary action against 36 mechanics that it says participated in a sickout in Los Angeles on the eve of the Democratic National Convention this month.</p>
        <p>United has apologized for the scheduling problems and has canceled about 3 percent of its 2,400 daily flights through September and announced a reduced flight schedule for the fall.</p>
