        <p>KAREN FISHER has the usual New York apartment problems. Her home for more than 20 years is small, 500 square feet plus a terrace. Even worse, it's her office as well.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Fisher, who matches interior designers with clients for a living, has been in a singular position to do something about the situation. And she did, hiring designers to help transform the place on Gramercy Park four times in the course of two decades, as trends changed and so did her tastes and needs. In the process she discovered what endured and what eventually wore out its welcome. And through refining what worked in her apartment, she found out a great deal about herself.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fisher, 56, does not think repeated redecorating is that unusual. Yet, even with her knowledge and experience, she made the same mistakes as some of her clients, and like them, she found herself fretting about escalating costs. At one point she thought she needed to replace only a carpet and ended up redoing her whole apartment.</p>
        <p>''For me, it's like a busman's holiday,'' she said. ''I can't help myself. Every couple of years I need to do it. I mean, why would anyone want the same sofa forever?'' She did keep the same banquette through two renovations, because it was ideal for the layout and could be reupholstered. But she changed one item over and over until she got rid of it entirely -- the dining room table. ''I didn't need a dining table -- don't cook,'' she said. ''I do not do formal dining in this apartment.'' It took only three remodelings for her to realize that.</p>
        <p>As president of her own company, Designer Previews, she has 300 designers at the ready. Think of her as a dedicated follower of interior fashions, and this as her scrapbook.</p>
        <p>RENOVATION NO. 1: 1980 -- In May of 1980, Ms. Fisher returned from the Greek island of Hydra, where she had fallen in love with the architecture. She signed the lease on the penthouse she now has, with wraparound terrace and views. ''It was a real dump,'' she recalled. The rent, $800, seemed extravagant at the time.</p>
        <p>''I wanted a totally Greek apartment,'' Ms. Fisher said, laughing now at her fantasy of recreating the Mediterranean in a big-city apartment.</p>
        <p>She hired a decorator, Robert Hart, who has since died, to do the job. The floors were white. The walls were white. The ceiling was blue. She did no major construction work. Her superintendent did the paint job.</p>
        <p>The furniture was kept to a minimum: an inexpensive glass-top table from the Door Store and a giveaway sofa from a neighbor who was moving. She slipcovered the sofa and put it near the coffee table.</p>
        <p>That was it for the living room. ''Windows were bare, because I guess I thought I was going to be looking out at the Aegean,'' she said wistfully. Instead, she was looking at a chimney spewing soot. So she spent most of her time swabbing the white floor, which she soon realized was impractical.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, she ran her business from the bedroom where, over the next three years and aided by a basic desk and file cabinets, she wrote three books on home design.</p>
        <p>Since Ms. Fisher had no interest in cooking, Mr. Hart removed kitchen cabinets that were hanging on by a nail. The total cost for Ms. Fisher's decorating -- this was 1980, remember -- was $5,200, including $1,200 for Mr. Hart's design fee and $400 for fabric for the sofa. ''I was a writer back then, and $5,000 was a lot of money,'' she said. ''But I have always felt that living well was the greatest reward.''</p>
        <p>Yet, it was only five years before the apartment had to be done over. ''It was charming and personal, but not right for business to be conducted,'' she said.</p>
        <p>RENOVATION NO. 2: 1985 -- Ms. Fisher started over. She needed a place to see clients, a much more luxurious apartment with wall-to-wall carpeting. ''What had been sweet and dear to me about the first renovation just didn't feel that way anymore,'' she said. ''I wanted tailored and chic, as opposed to offbeat and charming.'' She went for a gorgeous sandblasted glass table and upgrades in lighting and art. She also wanted a comfortable place to read and a well-conceived seating arrangement for the living room.  She needed multitask furniture that would suit her multitask life. Thus, the sandblasted glass table would be both a dining table and a desk for meeting clients. And since the people she was meeting were designers, ''I needed a real showplace,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The design firm of Siskin Valls was hired to transport Ms. Fisher from the Greek Islands to Manhattan. ''We were both starting out back then,'' Paul Siskin said recently. ''She had just become my rep. I hardly knew her, so I really wanted it to be good.''</p>
        <p>He implored her to use some color, which she did, a soft blue-gray. But as the process went forward, and more options were presented, she became overwhelmed. ''I had been a design editor for 15 years, and suddenly there were so many decisions to be made,'' she said. ''It was harrowing.''</p>
        <p>There was also the problem of tearing out what had been done before.</p>
        <p>''When you are redoing what's already there, it is a struggle between the old and the new,'' Ms. Fisher said. She had assumed that there had to be a table in the kitchen. It was up to Mr. Siskin to convince her otherwise and to build in a banquette. (The next decorator would turn the same space into a closet. ''And that was better yet,'' Ms. Fisher said.)</p>
        <p>The budget was $22,000, which included a $4,500 fee for Siskin Valls's design, $2,500 to redo the floors and $1,400 for sofa fabric.</p>
        <p>RENOVATION NO. 3: 1992 -- This time it was a matter of style. The sandblasted glass table just screamed 1980's. Out it all went, except for one photo. The walls turned from blue-gray to a buttery Tuscan yellow over rough stucco.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fisher hired Clodagh. ''I was absolutely terrified,'' Clodagh said. ''I had high fear.'' But she also had strong opinions. One of them was that an office shouldn't be in the bedroom. ''There were files all over the bed,'' Clodagh said. ''It was not exactly erotic.'' The terrace and light were buried behind heavy drapes, she added. And there was worse: ''When you came into the apartment, you could see right into the bathroom,'' she said. ''Very bad feng shui.''</p>
        <p>Architectural changes were in order. Clodagh reshaped the entry to the living room with deep storage cabinets. Out went the window coverings to let the light in. Wooden blinds produced striking shadows. The home office was moved to the living room.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fisher at first found Clodagh's preference for overscale architectural touches hard to accept, because her apartment was so small. Then she learned not to judge any work at the halfway point. ''Until the cabinet in the kitchen was finished and painted, it looked horrible, gargantuan,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Clodagh remembers that Ms. Fisher was no different from any other client. There were moments of drama and tension, particularly over light fixtures, none of which Ms. Fisher liked. ''Karen's job drove me into designing lighting, because it was difficult to find fixtures that were subtle and sophisticated,'' Clodagh said.</p>
        <p>An Oriental rug for $6,500 (''pretty and practical,'' Ms. Fisher said) completed the job. The project budget was $86,000, which included $27,000 for construction and $20,000 for the designer, as well as $4,100 for upholstering that banquette in the living room.</p>
        <p>RENOVATION NO. 4: 2000 -- The millennium -- who could resist? Besides, the golden-hued Tuscan style apartment was no longer that alluring. ''I had lived with it long enough,'' Ms. Fisher said.</p>
        <p>She decided she wanted simple elegance, just as she had pared down her personal style. ''Now, I wanted pure New York City,'' Ms. Fisher said. ''A simple, clean space with less of everything.'' She hired Clodagh once more for what was supposed to be a just a cosmetic face-lift. It started with the sisal carpet, which was a goner and -- Ms. Fisher blames herself -- escalated from there.</p>
        <p>Clodagh turned the walls pale taupe. ''It created a heavenly feeling of peace here,'' Ms. Fisher said. What had once been a rough farmhouse texture on the walls became (thanks to four men working three weeks, at a cost of $11,000) an elegant polished plaster impregnated with paint. Ms. Fisher even sold her Oriental rug, and got back what she had paid for it.</p>
        <p>The most expensive part of this renovation was the kitchen, where beige metal cabinet doors were replaced with custom-made stainless steel; the original countertop became a thick slab of concrete. The kitchen alone cost $36,000. The ''cosmetic face-lift'' ended up costing $136,300 -- and yes, folks, she's still renting.</p>
        <p>EACH TRANSFORMATION -- had been predicated by particular needs. The whole process seemed disorienting. But over time, the challenges became lessons.</p>
        <p>''This process can be a nightmare, no matter who you are, or whom you know,'' Ms. Fisher said. ''Renovating is a democratizing and humbling experience, and it's enough to make you crazy.''</p>
        <p>But it's also a process of refining your ideas about yourself and the way you live. ''What I've learned is that anything that is beautiful isn't always wonderful when you live with it,'' she said. ''Only practical is pretty in the long run.''</p>
