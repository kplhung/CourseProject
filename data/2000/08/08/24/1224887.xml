        <p>RCA, which made its name in stereo equipment and televisions, wants to get its consumers reading again. To that end, the company is releasing two new electronic readers, or e-books.</p>
        <p>The two models RCA will begin selling this fall are, in effect, the next generation of the Rocket eBook and Softbook Reader.

        <p>RCA, which made its name in stereo equipment and televisions, wants to get its consumers reading again. To that end, the company is releasing two new electronic readers, or e-books.</p>
        <p>The two models RCA will begin selling this fall are, in effect, the next generation of the Rocket eBook and Softbook Reader. The companies that made those two devices, NuvoMedia and Softbook Press, were bought earlier this year by Gemstar International, which also owns TV Guide. Gemstar, in turn, has licensed the technology to Thomson Multimedia, RCA's owner.</p>
        <p>RCA's eBooks, like their ancestors, can handle  only electronic books and magazines produced in a special format that is also controlled by Gemstar. The REB1100 will hold about 20 novels with its standard 8 megabytes of memory, but a 64-megabyte memory expansion card will also be available. Its 5.5-inch black-and-white screen has about six times the resolution of screens on most monochrome personal digital assistants, according to Thomson. More muscular users might like the REB1200, with a full-color 8.5-inch display. The advantages of full color come at the expense of resolution, which is slightly lower.</p>
        <p>Both devices will feature built-in modems, and the REB1200 will also have a high-speed Ethernet connection for downloading reading material without a computer. ''The mass market is what RCA is good at doing,'' said Lou Lenzi, vice president for new-media business development at Thomson. ''To bring this to the masses, we need the experience to be as simple as possible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lenzi expects that the basic model will not cost more than $300.</p>
