        <p>SHEREEF MOUSTAFA has always been cautious about opening e-mail notes containing attachments because he worries about viruses, but when he received a video e-mail message about an Oracle conference, his curiosity got the better of him. He clicked on the e-mail's attachment, and a crisp video began to play almost immediately.</p>
        <p>The 30-second video invitation was so intriguing that Mr. Moustafa, a marketing manager for an e-business company based in Los Angeles, not only signed up for the advertised conference but also forwarded the message to several of his colleagues.</p>
        <p>''When I got it,'' Mr. Moustafa said, ''I was quite honestly blown away. It was tight, easy to watch and didn't waste my time. I really got a feeling for what the conference would be about in a short period of time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moustafa is not alone. Jay Stevens, marketing director for RadicalMail, the company in Marina Del Rey, Calif., that created and sent the conference video via e-mail, said the Oracle conference invitation had been sent to 27,000 people and had been opened 41,000 times.</p>
        <p>''Before we sent out the invitation, FirstConferences was getting 10 people signing up for the conference per day,'' Mr. Stevens said. ''After the video e-mail, they got 40 to 50 signups a day.''</p>
        <p>Video e-mail messages contain video clips or links to clips that have been created for an advertiser or an organization. Video e-mail can be used to send news and information to users who request it. Video e-mail is relatively new, but the Discovery Channel, the pop singer Britney Spears and Nissan automobile dealers in the Atlanta area have already jumped on the video bandwagon.</p>
        <p>The reason is simple: Video e-mail lets advertisers tell a story and gives consumers access to extra features that all-text e-mail  cannot provide. For example, Britney Spears's video e-mail, which was sent to members of her fan club, contains a short clip of the singer's latest single as well as a contest link, an e-commerce component that lets users order her latest CD and an automatic forwarding option.</p>
        <p>''We're really providing people with entertainment that they can use to educate themselves and gain access to things that they are really interested in,'' said Tom Blakeley, the co-chairman of MindArrow Systems, a company based in Aliso Viejo, Calif., that provided the technology behind the Britney Spears campaign. ''We create a way to deliver content that makes people say wow and gives them a reason to open their e-mail.''</p>
        <p>That factor is what Michele Slack, a senior analyst with Jupiter Communications, based in New York, says will add to the proliferation of video e-mail. ''We're seeing more and more companies utilizing e-mail for marketing,'' Ms. Slack said. ''With more than 268 billion e-mail messages being delivered in a year by 2005, any type of e-mail that can stand out and break through the clutter is going to be increasingly powerful.''</p>
        <p>But even with the wow factor, there are two potential problems with video e-mail. The first is the bandwidth required to view the videos. Today, more than 70 percent of consumers use a low-bandwidth, dial-up connection to the Web, according to Dataquest, a research firm in San Jose, Calif. Video e-mail, especially streaming e-mail, requires large chunks of bandwidth. High-quality video clips are often as large as 800 kilobytes. Trying to watch a video that large over a dial-up line can be difficult, if not impossible, depending on the speed of a connection.</p>
        <p>Although most Web-based video is optimized for people with high-speed connections, who are expected to be a minority for at least several years, Ms. Slack said, most people with dial-up connections will be willing to wait for videos to be downloaded, at least in the beginning.</p>
        <p>''On the forefront of any new technology there is an increased factor of tolerance,'' she said. ''Customers are willing to experiment more, and they are willing to be more accepting.''</p>
        <p>The companies that develop video e-mail -- like MindArrow Systems; RadicalMail; InChorus.com, in Santa Clara, Calif.; Media1st.com, in Atlanta; and helloNetwork in Las Vegas -- are trying to circumvent bandwidth limitations by pushing video only when a user opens a message. That helps advertisers avoid the possibility that large e-mail messages will be sent to people who do not want them. It also helps companies track when a video is viewed and for how long it is viewed, something that critics say could lead to privacy problems.</p>
        <p>Because companies can track who is watching, how long they stay with the message and to whom they forward the files, the companies can theoretically create databases containing preferences and personal information.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stevens, of Radical E-Mail, played down the threat of customer profiling, saying that most video e-mail companies send these messages only to consumers who ''opt in,'' or agree to accept them. ''If someone has opted in, they can just as easily opt out,'' Mr. Stevens said. ''In addition, they have already provided a great deal of demographic information to begin with.''</p>
        <p>Tom Dody, the chief executive of Media1st.com, agreed. ''We always tell consumers right up front that we're collecting the information that we do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And there is an upside to this type of business model, Ms. Slack said. Because most people getting video e-mail choose to do so, and because video messages are more expensive to produce than text messages, consumers will see little if any video e-mail spam, she said.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Moustafa, giving up a little bit of personal data is a small price to pay for compelling information that he actually wants. ''Video is definitely a differentiator,'' he said. ''It was totally like watching television. I would definitely want to see more of this kind of e-mail. It certainly beats spam any day.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 25, 2000, Friday  An article in Circuits yesterday about video e-mail messages misidentified the company that used the technology for a campaign promoting an Oracle Corporation conference. The campaign was created by MindArrow Systems of Aliso Viejo, Calif., not RadicalMail.</p>
