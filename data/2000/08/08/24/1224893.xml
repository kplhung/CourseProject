        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Two Visions of Government'' (editorial, Aug. 20) did a fine job of pointing out to Ralph Nader and his supporters the real differences between the positions of the two major parties.  But one further point should be noted.</p>
        <p>The next president will undoubtedly appoint at least one and possibly up to three new Supreme Court justices.  One of these two visions of government, when enacted into law, will come under the new court's scrutiny.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Two Visions of Government'' (editorial, Aug. 20) did a fine job of pointing out to Ralph Nader and his supporters the real differences between the positions of the two major parties.  But one further point should be noted.</p>
        <p>The next president will undoubtedly appoint at least one and possibly up to three new Supreme Court justices.  One of these two visions of government, when enacted into law, will come under the new court's scrutiny.</p>
        <p>Its decisions will freeze the prevailing view, particularly those items concerning social issues, the environment and campaign finance reform, in place not for the next four years but for the next generation.</p>
        <p>One thing both candidates do agree on is that this election is about the future of our children. Indeed it is, and our grandchildren's as well.</p>
        <p>PAUL H. ROHMANN  Putney, Vt., Aug. 21, 2000</p>
