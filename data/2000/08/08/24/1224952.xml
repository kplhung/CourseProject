        <p>''We think there is a parallel between federal involvement in education and the decline in profit over recent years.''</p>
        <p>-- Ronald Reagan in 1983</p>
        <p>For those who haven't noticed, American schools are becoming more and more crowded. The Department of Education reported this week that the nation's elementary and secondary schools would enroll a record 53 million students this fall. By the end of the century, student enrollment in the U.S. is expected to soar past 90 million, and could reach a phenomenal 100 million students.</p>
        <p>''We have a century of growth ahead of us, a crescendo of children,'' said Education Secretary Richard Riley. Americans would be wise, he said, ''to figure out where we will put these children and who will teach them.''</p>
        <p>Education is one of the hot issues in the presidential campaign. All the candidates are in favor of enhanced student achievement, tough standards, rigorous testing. And all agree that steps have to be taken to improve the performance of black and Latino students.</p>
        <p>No one wants school kids to grow up spelling like Dan Quayle.</p>
        <p>That being the case, the report this week from Mr. Riley's office is ominous. Overcrowded schools undermine two components critical to improving student performance -- smaller classes, especially in the early grades, and widespread access to pre-kindergarten programs.</p>
        <p>President Clinton made a stop in South Brunswick, N.J., yesterday to visit a school that will be holding some classes in portable trailers this fall. He was pushing his school construction initiative. If you want kids to do better, the president said, squeezing them into overcrowded classrooms is not the answer.</p>
        <p>The Republican Party has traditionally been absent on the issue of federal education assistance. Ronald Reagan wanted to abolish the Department of Education, and G.O.P. hostility to a federal role in education remained ferocious right through the Gingrich era. School lunch programs, Head Start -- you name it, top Republican politicians were against it.</p>
        <p>This year is supposed to be different. The ebullient George W. Bush wraps his arms around the education issue at every opportunity. Dick Cheney, who voted against funding for Head Start when he was in Congress, said this week that education was probably ''the single most important issue'' in the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>But when you look closely at the proposals that would help students most -- federal assistance in building and modernizing schools and putting more teachers into classrooms -- the enthusiasm for education aid among top Republicans evaporates.</p>
        <p>The Republican leadership in Congress is standing in the way of the initiative touted by Mr. Clinton yesterday -- a $25 billion tax proposal to help states finance the building of new schools and the renovation of old ones in need of repair. Such federal help is crucial if smaller classes are to become a widespread reality.</p>
        <p>There are 226 co-sponsors of the legislation, which means more than half the members of the House support it. But the Republican leadership is blocking a vote on the measure.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore strongly supports the legislation, but Governor Bush does not. He has derided it as a ''bricks and mortar'' approach to education reform.</p>
        <p>The G.O.P. leadership in Congress is also blocking Clinton administration efforts to provide federal funding for the hiring of 100,000 teachers. This is part of an effort by the administration to help reduce the average class size in grades one through three all across the country.</p>
        <p>The Republicans do not have a lot of credibility on the education issue. That will hardly improve if Governor Bush and Mr. Cheney travel the country claiming to be education champions while at the same time standing in the way of those programs that would help children most.</p>
        <p>''Overcrowding is not simply an issue of inconvenience,'' said Leonie Haimson, an education consultant and author of a recent report on class size reduction in New York City. ''We now know for certain how critical smaller classes are for improving achievement levels among kids, and specifically for reducing the achievement gap. We are just not giving a fair shake to the kids in these overcrowded and falling-apart schools.''</p>
