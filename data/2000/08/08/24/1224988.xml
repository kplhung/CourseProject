        <p>With parties being thrown to celebrate it, news organizations scheduling special coverage and viewers all over the nation waiting in near breathless anticipation, a summer television series ended last night accompanied by the kind of attention usually reserved for massive national events, on the scale of the Super Bowl or the Academy Awards.</p>
        <p>And all of it to learn that one contestant, Richard Hatch, 39, a corporate trainer from Newport, R.I., had managed to win a million dollars by enduring a made-for-television survival test on a island off the coast of Borneo.</p>
        <p>''Survivor,'' the CBS hit that built over a 13-week run to what was expected last night to be the biggest single television audience ever assembled for a summer television series, far eclipsed every expectation the network had when it acquired the rights to the show last year. Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television and the man who decided to put the show on the air, said, ''It has beaten our expectations by about double.''</p>
        <p>One indication of how big the show has been: even before last night's hugely anticipated finale, ''Survivor'' had already surpassed the ratings for other television events this year like the World Series, the N.B.A. finals, the N.C.A.A. men's basketball finals and the Grammy Awards.</p>
        <p>And unlike those events, for which networks pay huge fees -- in the case of sports usually hundreds of millions of dollars a year -- ''Survivor'' was acquired for what amounted to a bargain basement price. CBS executives did not disclose the cost, but when ABC was in the running to buy the show, it was priced at $700,000 an episode.</p>
        <p>For such a modest sum CBS acquired a show that has generated national discussions in homes and offices, endless reports on television news programs, cover articles in national magazines and front-page reports in dozens of newspapers.</p>
        <p>At the same time ''Survivor'' all but transformed CBS, long considered the stodgiest network, into, of all things, a haven for young-adult viewers. CBS, which was able to charge advertisers up to $600,000 for every commercial in last night's finale, is expected to capitalize financially even more spectacularly in  January, when a second edition of ''Survivor'' starts immediately following the Super Bowl, which will also be broadcast by CBS.</p>
        <p>But perhaps more significant, ''Survivor'' has demonstrated to network executives that they can still be in the business of reaching a truly mass audience. As they have faced increasingly dire predictions that the coming onslaught of technological advances in computers and new recording devices would put them out of the business, network executives have in recent years pointed more and more toward what they call ''event programming'' as their island of survival.</p>
        <p>None of them even imagined that perhaps the best example of event programming any of them could find would come from a show about surviving on an island.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moonves pointed out that many of network television's highest-rated shows are now events of a sort. From the departure of cast members like George Clooney from ''E.R.'' to the season finales of shows like ''Friends,'' networks have found themselves more and more compelled to turn weekly shows into events that viewers believe they cannot miss.</p>
        <p>''But this event evolved naturally,'' Mr. Moonves said. ''That's made it even more effective.''</p>
        <p>Asked why he believed the show managed to emerge as a national phenomenon, Mark Burnett, the executive producer of ''Survivor,'' pointed to how well it worked as ''unscripted drama,'' and said: ''I always believed it was going to generate strong water cooler conversation. Nobody could have predicted the ratings success. But I knew that the premise -- a group of people marooned on an island, where they had to survive by working together, and they had to work against each other to win a million-dollar prize -- I knew that premise was superior.''</p>
        <p>The premise had been put together  by a British production company that had never even sold the idea to television in Britain. Mr. Moonves said Mr. Burnett, who acquired the United States rights from the British company, produced the show so skillfully and cast it so well that it came together perfectly.</p>
        <p>''It worked because it's an adventure, it's a game show, and it's a great soap opera,'' Mr. Moonves said. ''And it may even have hit home with people because the good guys did not necessarily win.''</p>
        <p>The four remaining contestants in last night's finale had schemed together to eliminate the other contestants. ''The bad guys are often the most compelling characters,'' Mr. Moonves said. ''And people at home may have seen that and recognized what happens in their own lives, in corporate society or whatever. They have been thinking: 'That's why I haven't succeeded. The bad guys are to blame.' ''</p>
        <p>Crucial to the show's success of course has been the buildup of suspense every week about which contestant would be eliminated. But the suspense was almost entirely manufactured because the event itself was long over even before the show went on the air in June. It was taped in March. Still, despite all the avid interest, CBS managed to keep the big secret about who eventually survived the test until it was revealed last night.</p>
        <p>Partly CBS used a bit of scheming of its own to accomplish that feat. The network deliberately allowed false clues about the winner to circulate, most of which were exposed as wrong when suggested winners were eliminated one by one. That left viewers so confused they were unwilling to believe any supposed revelation of the true winner.</p>
        <p>None of the participants ever broke the honor code. All of them -- as well as the show's crew members -- had signed contracts threatening them with financial penalties if they leaked the news.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burnett said he had expected the formation of a voting alliance. ''It just seemed to be a very normal group-dynamic reaction. It happens every day on your job and my job.''</p>
        <p>As for the role played by Mr. Hatch, as leader of the alliance who spurred his little group to knock off his main competitors one by one, Mr. Burnett said: ''You can't predict that. There's no way to cast a person knowing he would do that. But demographically Mr. Hatch fit because he was on the wealthy side, he was highly educated, his job was corporate conflict management, plus he was a gay single parent. All very interesting. Why he reacted the way he reacted? Who knows?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burnett is already hard at work planning ''Survivor II,'' which will be set in the Australian outback. He is currently sorting through more than 49,000 applicants for that cast.</p>
