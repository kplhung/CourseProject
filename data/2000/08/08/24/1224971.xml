        <p>The onetime Jets quarterback Ken O'Brien, among a host of former players and a sellout gathering of 55,000 fans to pay homage to the retired Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino tonight, recalled one play in particular that defined the man who went on to be the most productive passer in National Football League history.</p>
        <p>It was 1985 at the Orange Bowl, where the Dolphins once played their home games, and the Jets had just scored to take a 17-14 lead with under a minute left. At the time Marino was a third-year pro.</p>
        <p>''Everybody thought we had the game won,'' O'Brien said. ''I'm on the sideline watching and all of a sudden I see Duper come up to the line of scrimmage all by himself in bump and run.</p>
        <p>''I hear Marino calling an audible, because he sees what I see. I start yelling at our defense, 'Get back, get back.' I look over at the coach. 'Call a timeout.' But it was too late.''</p>
        <p>The long touchdown pass, one of a record 420 Marino threw in 17 N.F.L. seasons, gave the Dolphins one of the 37 fourth-quarter comeback victories they achieved during No. 13's career.</p>
        <p>Marino retired after a largely acrimonious 1999 season with the then-Dolphins Coach Jimmy Johnson. Yet his impact on the franchise was so pervasive that the Dolphins organized tonight's tribute to give fans a chance to honor him. Never mind the possible threat of Tropical Storm Debby or tonight's conclusion of the television show ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>Pro Player Stadium, reduced to about 55,000 to accommodate a concert featuring Hootie and the Blowfish and large video screens, sold out in less than a week.</p>
        <p>Besides Marino, the other five quarterbacks from the distinguished class of 1983 -- John Elway, Jim Kelly, Todd Blackledge, Tony Eason and O'Brien -- were all here. So were the Hall of Fame quarterbacks Terry Bradshaw and Joe Namath (though he became ill and left), the Hall of Fame Coach Don Shula, some 50 former Dolphins and Marino's wife, Claire, their five children, and his parents, Dan Sr. and Veronica.</p>
        <p>It became impossible to keep track of the number of standing ovations that Marino received during a program that lasted two hours before the music began.</p>
        <p>At one point between songs, the crowd began chanting, ''One more year, one more year.''</p>
        <p>''Sorry,'' Marino said. Then, touched, he added, ''I would love to play one more year, but I can't.''</p>
        <p>Highlights of Marino's career were shown on the big screens early on, then the quarterbacks from '83 sat in chairs on the stage and talked informally among themselves.</p>
        <p>Blackledge noted it was rare in today's era of free agency for anyone to spend 17 seasons with one team. ''He's part of the old guard,'' Blackledge said. ''He committed himself to this town and this community and that's why you see so many people here.''</p>
        <p>Bradshaw inadvertently drew some scattered boos when he noted that if Marino had been drafted by his hometown Pittsburgh Steelers, he may well have won more and passed less. ''He wouldn't have thrown for as many yards, but that's O.K.,'' Bradshaw said. ''Winning Super Bowls is all right.''</p>
        <p>Marino's three favorite receivers -- Mark Duper, Mark Clayton and O. J. McDuffie -- were brought out. Before they left, Marino threw a football about 20 yards across the stage to each one.</p>
        <p>A local radio station had encouraged fans to write their personal thoughts about Marino on a giant card outside the stadium. It was filled well before sundown, mostly with an outpouring of emotion.</p>
        <p>A number of fans said they look forward to seeing Marino, who passed for a record 61,361 yards, in the Hall of Fame when he will be eligible for admission in five years.</p>
        <p>''I remember when Danny came in and sort of set the world on fire as a rookie,'' said Elway, the former Denver Broncos star. ''That set the bar awful high for the rest of us in the class. When Danny's around now, we don't even talk about stats. We change the subject.''</p>
        <p>Shula, the winningest coach in N.F.L. history, said he is proud that Marino was able to break most of the league passing records in 13 seasons under him that it took Fran Tarkenton 18 seasons to set.</p>
        <p>''He just felt that no matter what the defense was that he could somehow fit it in there,'' Shula said. ''He felt there was no defense for the perfect pass.''</p>
        <p>Marino now has eased into some television work, with more free time than he is accustomed to. He agreed with Kelly's assessment of retirement, ''You're always going to miss that little fight you had in you.''</p>
        <p>''Of course, I've had second thoughts,'' Marino said about his decision to retire. ''I've played football for more than 30 years. It's a tough thing to face, but I believe in my heart that I made the right decision.''</p>
