        <p>THE Gillmen in the Sega Dreamcast simulation Seaman do not seem to like me.</p>
        <p>I know that because they have told me so. ''You make me mad,'' said one that looked like Queen Victoria. Then it gave me a sidelong glance that could freeze lava as it swam languorously through the upper reaches of the virtual aquarium the Gillmen call home.</p>
        <p>Another, which looked like a soccer hooligan, was so incensed that it  could only growl at me as it passed. I felt properly chastised.</p>
        <p>The Gillmen -- fish with the gift of human speech, a biting sense of humor and disturbingly human faces -- are the stars of Seaman. This occasionally dark but wonderfully original simulation occasionally suggests a sophisticated turn on Eliza, a text-based exercise in artificial intelligence that began in the mid-1980's, but Seaman is also an exercise in sustained maintenance. The player becomes the Gillmen's custodian, their governess and their father-confessor as they evolve into an air-breathing, land-based life form.</p>
        <p>I have to feed the Gillmen regularly, but not too regularly, from a finite supply of food pellets. (A Gillman itself will eventually point the player to an additional food source.) I have to keep the tank clean by keeping up the flow of air. I must keep it warm (but not too warm) with a heater.</p>
        <p>And I must encourage the Gillmen's intellectual growth by speaking to them in simple phrases that the program can recognize. Symbols that appear on the screen of the Dreamcast's Visual Memory Unit, a piece of hardware required to play the game, indicate whether the Gillmen understand what I am saying. When they do understand, they often respond sensibly. The adults use a rather mannered male voice that suggests a cranky Dr. Frasier Crane.</p>
        <p>Another lesson from Seaman: nothing tears at the heart like a thankless child. The feedings, the belly tickles, the meticulous adjustments of their environment appear to have been for naught. The baby fish that once smiled at me and chimed, ''Play, play, play,'' have become cynical adults that appear to regard me as a necessary evil. Somehow, I have earned their contempt, and somehow, that matters.</p>
        <p>Their metamorphosis has been swift. By the second day, the infant Gillmen were responding (albeit in indecipherable baby burbles) to queries I had spoken into the microphone included with the program. By the third day, they were complaining in plain English about the lack of heat and their fear of the dark. On the fourth and fifth days, they were adults and had started to ask me questions.</p>
        <p>''You're 44?'' the fish asked. ''You're not going to go and have a midlife crisis on me, are you? I mean, I care, but I do have problems of my own.''</p>
        <p>In a real-world household like mine, with three dogs, two cats and three birds, five helpless Gillmen might seem like candidates ripe for neglect. But they have fit in to the morning routine. Right after the dogs bicker over which one is going to carry in the newspaper and before I feed the pigeons out front, I talk to the Gillmen. I ask if they want food. I ask if they are happy. I make the same kissing sounds to them that I make when I kiss the dogs on the ears. I figure that affection is a universal language and can't hurt.</p>
        <p>One morning a Gillman responded coldly: ''I'm not your dog.''</p>
        <p>How did it know about the dogs?</p>
        <p>This could be the anti-Pokemon. The odd creatures sometimes seem to have been assembled with an eye to horror movies. The hatchlings look like nothing so much as floating eyeballs. Watching the octopuslike creature that ingests the eyeballs, then dies convulsively as they mature into tiny Gillmen, it is hard not to think of the movie ''Alien.''</p>
        <p>And the stalk that erupts from the peak of a Gillman's forehead recalls the extended pineal gland of the protagonist in the 1986 movie ''From Beyond.'' The very placement of a human face on the front end of a fish suggests the conflation of a man and his dog in the 1978 remake of ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers.''</p>
        <p>And that's to say nothing of a penchant exhibited early in the Gillmen's career. As I chatted with one of the Gillmen, another swam up from behind and below and connected its forehead tentacle to the underside of the Gillman I was addressing.</p>
        <p>''Get off,'' the first Gillman protested. The aggressor would have none of it. The tentacle remained in place, the victim's mouth opened helplessly and the light went out of its eyes.</p>
        <p>My babies are cannibals.</p>
        <p>I learned from the narrator, the actor Leonard Nimoy, at the next session that this was simply survival of fittest. At the outset of each Seaman session, Mr. Nimoy brings the player up to date on events within the habitat (events that occur even without your participation), offers suggestions and notes the frequency of your visits. (''You visit often,'' Mr. Nimoy intoned on a day I had looked in on the Gillmen four times. ''If one didn't know better, one might assume you're quite obsessed -- or have nothing better to do.'')</p>
        <p>If you cut him off too precipitously, Mr. Nimoy responds with a cough or comment. The message is clear: even small actions carry consequences.</p>
        <p>The game bears that out. The Gillmen are children, and you must be careful what you say and do around children. After turning my initial brood into former life forms, I am being a cautious surrogate parent. I have been rewarded with a more elaborate dialogue with my two surviving adults.</p>
        <p>There are no intrinsically bad Seamen -- just inattentive owners. The Gillman is largely a reflection of its environment and the level of care it receives. It is particularly bad-tempered when it hasn't been fed. (''Hey,'' the soccer hooligan said. ''Food. Here. Now.'')</p>
        <p>That Gillman's current topic of inquiry is my wife (whom it sarcastically calls ''your sweetie''). It has read our horoscopes and asked if we planned to have children.</p>
        <p>''Children can bring great joy,'' the soccer hooligan said, ''if you don't wring their necks first.''</p>
        <p>That finally got to me. I really wanted to put the Gillman in its place -- not for the first time -- and started to do so.</p>
        <p>But I cut myself off. Seaman's central mystery for me has become engaging the Gillmen's affections, and I didn't want to jeopardize our fragile bond.</p>
        <p>The soccer hooligan acted as though it had not heard me. But the look of mingled mirth and impudence on its face spoke volumes.</p>
