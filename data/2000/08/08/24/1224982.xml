        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>CLINTON ELUDING THE LIMELIGHT -- President Clinton is working hard to leave the limelight to Vice President Al Gore, aides say. He scrapped plans to travel to Atlanta yesterday to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the welfare reform law. It seems the Gore campaign preferred that he not go, a message that William M. Daley, the campaign chairman, passed along to John D. Podesta, the president's chief of staff. Mr. Clinton did go to New Jersey yesterday for two low-key political fund-raisers. But he kept the focus on Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, saying that the most important thing was for the two ''to go out and spread the message, engage in the debate and make sure the American people know what the choices are before them.''</p>

        <p>THE INTEREST GROUPS</p>
        <p>LEWINSKY JOB OFFER -- The job offer generated publicity all right, but probably not the kind that the nonprofit organization wanted. American Women Presidents, a new group based in Sacramento, that advocates election of a woman as president and vice president, offered Monica Lewinsky a job on Tuesday as its corporate vice president. But hours later, the group rescinded the offer after protests from women's groups and others. In its job offer, the group said that it was disturbed that Ms. Lewinsky's career had been sidetracked since her relationship with President Clinton and hoped that she could use her name recognition to promote the election of women. But the group's founder, Mosemarie Boyd, said she later decided against risking her organization's credibility by offering a job to Ms. Lewinsky.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>RUNOFF IN SELMA -- For the first time in 36 years, Mayor Joe Smitherman of Selma, Ala., was forced on Tuesday into a runoff election, raising the serious possibility that the mostly black city, infamous in the 1960's for its bitter civil rights struggles, will be led next by a black mayor. Mr. Smitherman, 70, was first elected mayor in 1964 and has since always managed to win re-election the first time around, usually with the help of some black voters. He was challenged on Tuesday, for the third time, by James Perkins, a black businessman who got 43 percent of the vote, compared to Mr. Smitherman's 46 percent. Two other black candidates got the remainder of the vote. Mr. Smitherman will face Mr. Perkins in a Sept. 12 runoff.</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>DRAW, WIN OR LOSE -- The split in the national Reform Party left the Federal Election Commission in a big quandary: Which faction should get $12.5 million in federal campaign funding the original party had coming before the split? An answer is expected in about 10 days. But state election officials also face a big quandary: Which of two rival Reform Party candidates should appear on the ballot this fall. In at least two states, officials will hold a drawing today to answer that question. In Iowa, Secretary of State Chet Culver will select from two pieces of paper, one bearing the name of Patrick J. Buchanan, the hard-right conservative commentator, the other bearing the name of John Hagelin, a physicist. The winner will go on the ballot as the Reform Party candidate while the loser will appear as ''a candidate nominated by petition.'' In Montana, Secretary of State Mike Cooney will use a similar lottery system. But only the winner will go on the Montana ballot. The loser in both states is expected to go to court.</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>MAKING POWER AN ISSUE -- Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and Green Party presidential candidate, has been hammering hard on the theme that corporations have far too much power. So when he got to California this week, he saw major political opportunity in the skyrocketing cost of electricity, which has recently doubled and even quadrupled in some places following price deregulation by the state. In San Diego, the first city to feel the effects of free market prices, he charged that big corporations had dominated the deregulation process and called on Californians to seize back regulatory control of the electricity industry and demand their money back. State officials, he said, should push through a rate rollback law that does not include a provision to compensate utilities for any money that might cost them. ''Electricity deregulation really brings about a collision of interests,'' Mr. Nader said. ''It pits the interests of consumers, who are often unorganized and lack power, against the interests of suppliers, who are usually very organized, powerful and have a lot of money behind them.''</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>CHENEY IN CALIFORNIA -- Dick Cheney was also in California yesterday, but the issues he hit hardest had nothing to do with corporate or electric power. Rather he emphasized three themes that have become central to the Bush-Cheney campaign in recent days: bolstering education, the military and the nation's sense of honor and integrity, the latter almost always a none-too-subtle reference to President Clinton's conduct in the White House. In Bakersfield, Mr. Cheney told a group of high school students in the Junior Reserved Officers Training Corps that ''nothing is more essential to education than teaching character,'' and he suggested that permitting prayer in public schools would help accomplish the job. ''We want our children to learn to read and write, but we also want them to know right from wrong,'' he said. ''''My time as secretary of defense taught me the enormous importance, if you will, of character in terms of the functioning of the U.S. military. No military organization can survive without honor and integrity.''</p>
