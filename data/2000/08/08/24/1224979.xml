        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Defense in the 21st Century'' (editorial, Aug. 21) didn't mention yet another flaw in our military planning, one summarized in ''Global Arm Sales Swell to $30 Billion'' (news article, Aug. 21).</p>
        <p>Selling arms is a policy that is long overdue for change. Why do we find ourselves investing at the extremes of technology while official policy is to market that technology and thereby jeopardize the advantage our investment has earned us? Examples include missile technology exported to Iran through China and the American buildup of the Iraqi military to fight Iran in the 1980's.</p>

        <p>National gun control policy would attempt to reduce risky gun sales, but international weapons trafficking is an addiction at odds with risk management.</p>
