        <p>In 1998, Dick Cheney pulled off what was widely seen as a business coup. Ending years of fruitless talks, Mr. Cheney arranged a merger between Halliburton, the company he ran, and its chief rival, Dresser Industries, creating the world's largest oil field services and construction company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, the chief executive of Halliburton, initiated the deal while on a quail hunt with his counterpart from Dresser. The negotiations that followed were so amicable, the companies dispensed with the close scrutiny of each other's businesses that is usually part of a merger, a Dresser official said.</p>
        <p>Some key Dresser executives quickly came to regret that decision, present and former company officials say. They were startled to learn after the deal closed that several of the major projects negotiated by Mr. Cheney's management team were much less healthy than they appeared on Halliburton's books and were racking up significant losses.  The newly merged company was hit with several hundred million dollars of unexpected losses, including an estimated $100 million on a single pipeline project in South America begun on Mr. Cheney's watch, according to company insiders and others in the oil industry.</p>
        <p>The Dresser merger was the biggest deal of Mr. Cheney's five years at Halliburton and the losses that arose soon afterward were one of several missteps in a business record that has become part of his political resume since he was nominated to be the Republican candidate for vice president. The Bush campaign has defended his multimillion-dollar retirement payment from Halliburton as fair compensation for a job well done.</p>
        <p>''The American people should be pleased they have a vice-presidential nominee who has been successful in business,'' said Karen P. Hughes, communications director for the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>But just how successful Mr. Cheney was as a chief executive is a matter of considerable dispute, judging by a broad survey of his record that included interviews with present and former company executives.</p>
        <p>Some praised him for doubling the size of the company through mergers and a growing government business that has made Halliburton the nation's fifth-largest military contractor.</p>
        <p>Asked to assess Mr. Cheney's performance, Halliburton's vice chairman, Donald Vaughn, said he deserved a ''clearly superior'' grade. ''Mr. Cheney was anything but a status quo man,'' Mr. Vaughn said. ''He changed Halliburton and the popular judgment is he changed it for the better.''</p>
        <p>Other executives, however, said Mr. Cheney failed to keep a sufficiently tight rein on the company's aggressive pursuit of overseas energy projects and road-building work in the United States. Some Wall Street analysts, too, described Mr. Cheney's performance as little better than average.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Cheney declined to make him available for an interview and referred questions about his tenure at Halliburton to the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vaughn, the last president of Dresser, acknowledged in an interview that there had been ''overall surprise'' with the losses that emerged after the Dresser merger. Most of them, he said, came from contracts on the Halliburton side of the ledger.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vaughn blamed the reversals on an industry downturn caused by plummeting oil prices in late 1998 and on the complexity of the projects and said neither he nor his Dresser colleagues felt deceived. ''No one was flimflammed,'' he said. ''Absolutely not.''</p>
        <p>Halliburton's stock price, often regarded as a gauge of executive performance, rose sharply in Mr. Cheney's early years at the company, but it lagged its competitors in the final year and a half of his tenure.</p>
        <p>There is a presumption in business that a chief executive is broadly responsible for everything that happens in his company, for better or worse. Last year, the company's board of directors withheld bonuses from Mr. Cheney and his management team, which had failed to meet the board's financial targets for 1998 and 1999.</p>
        <p>David J. Lesar, the man Mr. Cheney picked to run the company's day-to-day operations, said his boss was ''hands off, very much a delegator'' whose main role at the company was cultivating clients and setting strategic direction. ''He and I talked almost every day,'' Mr. Lesar said. ''On major types of things, I would tell him what the decisions were.''</p>
        <p>In assessing Mr. Cheney's record at Halliburton, it is difficult to say -- as it would be with any large corporation -- what specific role the chief executive played in each initiative during his tenure. For example, it is not clear how much of a hand Mr. Cheney had in his management team's decision to start bidding more aggressively on smaller-scale highway projects. The company won a host of new contracts, but ran into difficulties in North Carolina and Mr. Bush's home state of Texas for failing to meet deadlines for completing the work. The projects were small by Halliburton standards, $20 million or less, but a company insider said the losses on several of them rose as high as $4 million to $5 million each.</p>
        <p>North Carolina and Texas fined the company for its tardiness and North Carolina officials went further, barring Halliburton from bidding on road work in the state. The company's travails in Texas are no secret: A partial list of the penalties, totaling $359,450, is on the Web site of the Bush administration's highway department.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lesar, now Halliburton's chief executive, said the setbacks in the road work were ''part and parcel'' of a business frequently punctuated by commercial disputes. ''It's absolutely not an embarrassment,'' he said. Mr. Lesar acknowledged, however, that the company, which expanded its road building under Mr. Cheney, is getting out of the business of doing such small-scale projects.</p>
        <p>Company executives said Mr. Cheney was frustrated in his desire to phase out another Halliburton business: its dealings with Libya through its British subsidiary.</p>
        <p>The company said the arrangements were within the law. The American embargo on Libya, imposed by President Ronald Reagan, allows subsidiaries of United States companies to earn money in Libya and send the profits home, provided the American parent company has no role in the operations and no Americans are involved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lesar said Mr. Cheney told executives soon after he arrived that he wanted to get out of Libya but was dissuaded by the argument that this would harm the company's long-term relationship with its customers. ''He had a fiduciary responsibility to his stockholders,'' Mr. Lesar said.</p>
        <p>Halliburton's subsidiary maintains smaller, similar business relationships in Iran and Iraq, Mr. Vaughn said.</p>
        <p>Company insiders said that some of Halliburton's woes under Mr. Cheney were common to corporate America in the late 1990's. The company has had difficulties creating a unified computer system across all of its diverse units. It is also still wrestling with a companywide initiative, begun at the behest of Mr. Cheney, to set up central management of purchasing, personnel and other administrative functions. Several executives said the results from this effort, which is costing several hundred million dollars,  have been disappointing thus far.</p>
        <p>The financial blemishes on Mr. Cheney's record at Halliburton are, in large measure, a matter of public record. The company's public financial reports disclosed its disappointing profits in the highway construction business, without providing specific numbers. And it said it had ''unusually high'' losses of nearly $180 million on ''technically complex'' projects in 1998 and 1999.</p>
        <p>Company's Beginnings</p>
        <p>Founded 81 years ago as an oil well service concern, Halliburton has grown into a wide-ranging energy technology and construction giant with revenues last year of $14.9 billion. Its 1962 merger with Brown &amp; Root, a Texas contracting company, brought in federal work that the company had won after financing the political career of Lyndon B. Johnson. ''Brown &amp; Root became an industrial colossus thanks to Lyndon Johnson,'' said Robert A. Caro, author of a multivolume biography of the president.</p>
        <p>By 1995, Halliburton was still rebounding from the previous decade's oil bust when its chairman, Thomas Cruikshank, went salmon fishing for five days with Mr. Cheney. The former secretary of defense had spent the previous two and a half years as a fellow with the Washington research organization, American Enterprise Institute, and had decided against a presidential bid. Mr. Cruikshank, who was retiring, championed Mr. Cheney as his successor.</p>
        <p>''I'm often asked why I left politics and went to Halliburton,'' Mr. Cheney said in a speech last November at the Institute of Petroleum in London, ''and I explain that I reached the point where I was mean-spirited, short-tempered and intolerant of those who disagreed with me and they said, 'Hell, you'd make a great C.E.O.,' so I went to Texas and joined the private sector.''</p>
        <p>Halliburton's fortunes were on the rebound in October 1995 when Mr. Cheney arrived as chief executive.</p>
        <p>Halliburton's stock had been an underperformer for much of the late 1980's and early 1990's, but what the company called a round of ''strategic actions,'' including payroll cuts and a restructuring of its basic businesses, substantially improved the company's results beginning in 1992. For the three and a half years before Mr. Cheney became chief executive on October 1, 1995, Halliburton's stock rose 82 percent, well above the 65 percent gain recorded by an index of companies in the oil service industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney moved to build on that success. He put Mr. Lesar, a top executive at Halliburton's biggest subsidiary, in charge of daily operations. Mr. Cheney was viewed, from the beginning, as a man who was to use his worldwide contacts to produce new business. ''When we brought Cheney in, it really wasn't to run operations, it was to make the proper strategic decisions, and to establish relationships,'' Mr. Cruikshank said.</p>
        <p>Among Mr. Cheney's first initiatives were well-regarded mergers that helped the company master the new technologies reshaping the energy industry. Halliburton acquired the Landmark Graphics Corporation, which develops software and data-management tools for the oil industry, and the Numar Corporation, which produces magnetic-resonance imaging instruments for energy exploration.</p>
        <p>The company also scored some victories in Washington under Mr. Cheney, winning a $1.1 billion Pentagon contract to provide a wide range of support for the military's  operations in the Balkans. A Pentagon official said there was no indication the former defense secretary had any role in sealing the deal, which expanded a contract Halliburton has held since 1992.</p>
        <p>New Road to Problems</p>
        <p>Halliburton's foray into road building went much less smoothly. The company's Brown &amp; Root unit had been doing road projects for most of the 20th century and as Mr. Cheney took the reins, it hoped to cash in on a nationwide boom in highway work.</p>
        <p>From November 1995 to November 1997, the company bid on 36 projects in North Carolina and won 9, totaling $100.9 million.</p>
        <p>''That was a pretty aggressive undertaking by them,'' said Terry Strickland, the contractual services engineer for the state Department of Transportation in Raleigh.</p>
        <p>State officials in North Carolina say that while they were pleased with the quality of Brown &amp; Root's work, they grew frustrated at chronic, substantial delays. Of the nine projects Brown &amp; Root took on in North Carolina, three failed to meet deadlines.</p>
        <p>When problems first developed, the state pressured Brown &amp; Root to work faster by imposing daily and even hourly penalties, and warned that it could be banned as a bidder. Finally, in a letter dated Aug. 3, 1998, the state banished Brown &amp; Root.</p>
        <p>''We have been unable to find any substantial reasons for the unsatisfactory progress on these projects except for the lack of effort that your company has put forth,'' wrote J. D. Goins, the state chief engineer for operations.</p>
        <p>The company's results in Texas have been mixed. It won an award from a nationwide industry group for the design of Interstate 75, the North Central Expressway, which it completed ahead of schedule. But state officials say they levied $677,000 in penalties on several road projects worth $143 million -- double the amount listed on the highway department's Web site.</p>
        <p>One of the projects on which Brown &amp; Root faces penalties is in the eastern Texas town of Lufkin, where the company is two months behind schedule on a $16 million overpass job begun in October 1997.</p>
        <p>But better late than never, state officials said. ''We're just hoping they finish this,'' said Cheryl Flood, the state Department of Transportation resident engineer at Lufkin who is overseeing the project.</p>
        <p>Faced with diminished profits and a string of headaches, Halliburton decided to phase out its smaller-scale road work, making it even harder to complete the remaining projects.</p>
        <p>Oscar Gutierrez, a project superintendent at Brown &amp; Root for the work in Lufkin, said  ''a lot of our key people left the company,''  when it decided to exit the business. Mr. Gutierrez said he has had to borrow managers from Halliburton's mining, pulp mill and petrochemical operations. ''All of our jobs are pushed back, mainly for lack of personnel, qualified people.''</p>
        <p>A New Alliance</p>
        <p>In early 1998, Mr. Cheney went quail hunting in South Texas with William E. Bradford, chairman and chief executive of  Dresser Industries. The two companies, industry leaders in oil services, had looked several times at the possibility of merging but had been unable to make a deal.</p>
        <p>Out hunting, the two men agreed to reopen talks. Within weeks, the two companies had plans to join forces, creating a company that would be headed by Mr. Cheney.</p>
        <p>Mergers typically include a process of what is known in the business world as ''due diligence,'' in which both companies look hard at each other's pending projects to make sure their assumptions about each other's value are based on solid numbers.</p>
        <p>In this case, however, the two chief executives felt so comfortable with each other they decided this would not be necessary, according to Mr. Vaughn, who was then Dresser's president.</p>
        <p>The deal closed in September 1998 and cultural clashes quickly emerged.</p>
        <p>One of the most jarring, present and former executives said, was over the arcane art of how to account for the profits produced by long-term projects. Dresser's Kellogg unit was known in the industry for its conservative approach and its executives prided themselves on never having to erase profits once they were entered in the ledgers. Halliburton officials, the executives said, were quicker to log the profits, relying on their ability to forecast how projects would turn out. This stirred resentment among Dresser managers who joined the new company. ''They would work you through the meat grinder,'' said one former executive. ''They would always opt for the most aggressive treatment.''</p>
        <p>Tensions between the two management teams deepened in the months after the merger with the discovery of large losses on some of the Halliburton projects.</p>
        <p>Dresser's construction unit had forecast a banner year for 1999, expecting profits of more than $200 million, including gains from the Halliburton contracts. But a spate of unexpected losses after the merger, mostly from Halliburton projects, shrunk those profits to roughly $100 million, a former company official said.</p>
        <p>Other losses flowed from Halliburton's overseas contracts, including a technically demanding project to build a natural gas pipeline from Bolivia to Brazil.</p>
        <p>Halliburton won a leading role in the $2 billion project in July 1997. The company said Mr. Cheney had no role in winning the contract or negotiating its terms.</p>
        <p>The project, which traversed a region of the Amazon known for its heavy rains, ran into unexpected difficulties. Poor weather, a  strike and construction problems sent the costs soaring, just as oil prices began to fall. Halliburton asked for more money but the Brazilian oil giant, Petrobras, declined to pay. Industry executives note that Halliburton's request for extra money came at an awkward moment, just as oil prices were reaching their lowest point in a decade.</p>
        <p>Halliburton says it is still negotiating with Petrobras over the contract. Mr. Lesar declined to discuss the amount of money at issue, but said all calculations of loss or profit on deals like the Brazil pipeline are estimates until such disputes are resolved.</p>
        <p>In December 1998, just three months after the merger, Halliburton declared in a public filing that ''extraordinary pressure'' from customers refusing to pay additional costs  had forced it to take $60 million in losses. Present and former company officials said the losses from overseas projects and the highway work have continued to mount, and now total more than $200 million.</p>
        <p>The merger stirred up bitterness, as mergers often do, prompting some Dresser executives to quit. At least three have sued the company, charging that Halliburton reneged on promises of a severance package.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lesar said the company met all its obligations to the executives whose jobs were eliminated or scaled back.</p>
        <p>But a lawsuit by Paul T. Butzberger, former president of Dresser Oil Tools, accuses Halliburton of repeatedly assuring him he would be able to keep his options for 60,000 shares of stock after his departure, and then refusing to honor those options.</p>
        <p>That decision stands in contrast to the board's treatment of Mr. Cheney. Halliburton's board voted last month to allow him to keep options for 400,000 shares, worth $6 million at yesterday's price, treating his departure as early retirement rather than a resignation. It also allowed him to keep 140,000 shares of stock, now worth $7.5 million, that it could have canceled.</p>
        <p>The Cheney Years</p>
        <p>Evaluating a chief executive's record is as much an art as a science. Mr. Vaughn, Halliburton's vice chairman, said Mr. Cheney should be judged on the performance of the company's stock, a standard benchmark. By that measure, Mr. Cheney's early years at Halliburton were more successful than his later ones, when the company performed less well than its peers.</p>
        <p>Over all, the Cheney years saw Halliburton stock underperform most stocks in its industry. From the time he became chief executive through the announcement he was leaving, Halliburton shares rose 110 percent, while the average oil service company share price rose 158 percent and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, an index of large company stocks, was up 151 percent.</p>
        <p>Arvind Sanger, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette said Mr. Cheney did ''an averagely decent job as C.E.O. I don't think he did an exceptional job.</p>
        <p>''He's much more comfortable talking about the big picture, not the nitty gritty of the business,'' said Mr. Sanger. ''Deep down inside, he's a politician at heart.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Cheney has a track record as chief executive that is mediocre against the backdrop of American business, his candidacy is nevertheless strongly supported by almost all of the executives who worked with him, even those who disagreed with how he led the company.</p>
        <p>''Dick Cheney is a great man, very focused, and he stands for a lot of the things I stand for,'' said one former executive who quit in frustration over the company's post-merger culture. ''I just couldn't stay in that environment,'' he said.''life is too short.''</p>
