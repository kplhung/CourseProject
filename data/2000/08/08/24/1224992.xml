        <p>The Republican National Committee has canceled plans to use a television commercial showing Vice President Al Gore saying in a 1994 interview with NBC that neither he nor President Clinton had lied in their political careers.</p>
        <p>The commercial was pulled, Republican officials said, because it did not make clear the date of the interview, nor did it explain that Mr. Gore was responding to questions about the United States Senate campaign of Oliver L. North in Virginia. There was also fear, they said, that swing voters would see the commercial as an unfair effort to saddle Mr. Gore with responsibility for Mr. Clinton's deceptive remarks about his affair with a White House intern.</p>

        <p>The Republican National Committee has canceled plans to use a television commercial showing Vice President Al Gore saying in a 1994 interview with NBC that neither he nor President Clinton had lied in their political careers.</p>
        <p>The commercial was pulled, Republican officials said, because it did not make clear the date of the interview, nor did it explain that Mr. Gore was responding to questions about the United States Senate campaign of Oliver L. North in Virginia. There was also fear, they said, that swing voters would see the commercial as an unfair effort to saddle Mr. Gore with responsibility for Mr. Clinton's deceptive remarks about his affair with a White House intern.</p>
        <p>''If there was confusion about when the interview was made, that would be a reason not to run the ad,'' a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Clifford May, said yesterday. ''We want to make things clearer for viewers and voters.''</p>
        <p>The Republican National Committee declined to release a tape or transcript of the advertisement or to say how many copies had been sent to television stations.</p>
        <p>But other Republicans said the commercial, produced by National Media, showed a television set on a kitchen table. The television is on, and the screen shows an excerpt from the 1994 interview by Lisa Meyers, who was asking Mr. Gore about his description of Mr. North as a ''pathological liar.''</p>
        <p>''Can you say that neither you nor President Clinton has told a lie in your political career?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>''Uh, none spring to mind, I'll tell you that,'' Mr. Gore replied.</p>
        <p>''And President Clinton has not uttered a single untruth in the last two years?'' she continued.</p>
        <p>''Not that I have heard. Absolutely not,'' Mr. Gore answered.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Gore's campaign headquarters in Nashville yesterday, some advisers professed disappointment that the advertisement was not shown as scheduled. They said they were certain that the advertisement would have backfired on the Bush campaign, angering voters because it did not make clear the time or context of the interview.</p>
        <p>''This is just the latest indication of disarray in the Bush campaign,''  said Mr. Gore's communications director, Mark Fabiani. 'Yesterday Bush failed to coherently defend his tax plan. Today Bush is mired in an indefensible ad debacle.''</p>
        <p>Mr. May said there had never been a decision to use the commercial, adding, ''If the Democrats want to make a big thing about an ad that didn't run, they can do so.''</p>
        <p>He and other Republicans also emphasized that Mr. Gore's character and integrity were likely to be the subject of future advertisements paid for by the Republican National Committee.</p>
        <p>''The issue of Al Gore's credibility remains to be discussed in this campaign,'' Mr. May said. ''But clearly we don't want to have an ad out that would confuse people in any way.''</p>
        <p>One adviser to the Bush campaign said yesterday that senior officials at the Republican National Committee first approached the Bush campaign on Wednesday with concerns about the advertisement.</p>
        <p>''We believe Al Gore's credibility is an issue, but to raise that issue, it  has to be done in a credible way,'' the adviser said. ''And this particular ad, with the date, might have been taken out of context.''</p>
        <p>Asked if there was concern that the ad could undercut Mr. Bush's pledge to raise the tenor of campaigning, the adviser replied: ''We think the tenor of the campaign is important, but it's also important to set the record straight. They've run $30 million worth of ads, the bulk of them being attack ads on Governor Bush's leadership in Texas.''</p>
