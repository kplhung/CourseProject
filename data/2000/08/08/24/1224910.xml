        <p>A panel of international experts recommended today that the United Nations peacekeeping department, under attack for a series of disasters in recent years, be enlarged and professionalized, with intelligence-gathering functions that were essentially forbidden during the cold war.</p>
        <p>The experts, appointed by Secretary General Kofi Annan, urged that more effort go into preventing situations from becoming crises -- not waiting for instructions from the Security Council. They also recommended that peacekeeping officials resist allowing larger countries to exert too much influence over their day-to-day activities. It is a vision certain to upset both American isolationists as well as some third world leaders who fear a that stronger, more independent organization would mean a new kind of colonialism.</p>

        <p>A panel of international experts recommended today that the United Nations peacekeeping department, under attack for a series of disasters in recent years, be enlarged and professionalized, with intelligence-gathering functions that were essentially forbidden during the cold war.</p>
        <p>The experts, appointed by Secretary General Kofi Annan, urged that more effort go into preventing situations from becoming crises -- not waiting for instructions from the Security Council. They also recommended that peacekeeping officials resist allowing larger countries to exert too much influence over their day-to-day activities. It is a vision certain to upset both American isolationists as well as some third world leaders who fear a that stronger, more independent organization would mean a new kind of colonialism.</p>
        <p>The experts' recommendations are contained in a report released just ahead of a summit meeting of world leaders in early September, when the issue of how much power the United Nations should have to intervene in nations torn by domestic crises is expected to be debated with some passion. Last year, Mr. Annan provoked a storm of protest by saying in a speech to the General Assembly that national borders should not be inviolate when rulers were abusing their populations.</p>
        <p>But even with a stronger peacekeeping department, the Security Council will still exercise considerable power over operations, and the whims of the most powerful five nations -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- will continue to be a factor.</p>
        <p>Even in a case like Rwanda, where up to 800,000 people died in genocidal attacks on the minority Tutsi population in 1994 and the United States prevented the deployment of an effective peacekeeping operation, experts argue that if the peacekeeping department had been better informed and more strongly staffed, a warning cable from the Canadian commander on the ground might not have been given short shrift by the big powers.</p>
        <p>In a case like Sierra Leone, where 500 ill-trained peacekeepers walked into ambushes in May, Secretary General Annan was left begging for military expertise -- finally provided by the British -- because the peacekeeping department did not have the people to do the job itself and did not have a roster of ready professionals on loan from governments to call on.</p>
        <p>The experts' recommendations follow nearly a decade in which the United Nations has drifted in trying to deal with peacekeeping problems. Their suggestions also call for speeding up response time, so that a simple peacekeeping operation could be launched in 30 days rather than several months, and sending expert advance teams to areas where very complex military and political situations prevail.</p>
        <p>Since the end of the cold war, all kinds of new assignments have been heaped on the peacekeeping department by the Security Council, free of the paralysis caused by the perpetual checkmating of initiatives by the Soviet Union or the United States when one camp or another was involved -- as in Vietnam in the 1960's or Afghanistan in the 1980's. Many of these assignments have not been practical, and the expert panel concluded that the United Nations must learn to ''just say no'' at times, rather than risk debacle.</p>
        <p>''There are many tasks which the United Nations peacekeeping forces should not be asked to undertake, and many places they should not go,'' the report said. ''But when the United Nations does send its forces to uphold the peace, they must be prepared to confront the lingering forces of war and violence with the ability and determination to defeat them.''</p>
        <p>The report, which concentrates heavily on practical measures to fix the shortcomings of an overstretched, outdated peacekeeping department, builds on specific earlier studies of the failures of the United Nations and its member countries to deal with disasters in Rwanda and Bosnia. The study paints a picture of an understaffed department with a perennially ad hoc air about it, whose every move is micromanaged by the 188-member General Assemby.</p>
        <p>Richard C. Holbrooke, the American ambassador to the United Nations, who has for months been advocating the strengthening of the peacekeeping department, the core function of the organization when its charter was adopted in 1945, welcomed the report as ''a big step forward.''</p>
        <p>''The United States doesn't agree with everything in this report,'' he said in an interview. ''But we are prepared to support it and to support a General Assembly resolution calling for its aggressive implementation.</p>
        <p>''There will always be people in the United States who view the U.N. as an invasive force that weakens our sovereignty,'' he said. ''But this administration's view is clear: the U.N. is flawed but it is indispensable. This report will, I hope, address some of its flaws.''</p>
        <p>The American expert on the review panel was J. Brian Atwood, former administrator of the United States Agency for International Development and now president of Citizens International, a private democracy-building organization. The panel's other experts included Colin Granderson of Trinidad and Tobago, who has directed missions in Haiti for the Organization of American States; Dame Anne Hercus, a New Zealander who headed a United Nations mission in Cyprus, and Richard Monk, a British police official who was commissioner of a United Nations police force in Bosnia.</p>
        <p>Also on the panel was Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany, former chairman of NATO's military committee; Hisako Shirmura of Japan, a former director of Latin American and European peacekeeping at the United Nations; Vladimir Shustov, a former Russian representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe; Gen. Philip Sibanda of Zimbabwe, a former United Nations commander in Angola, and Cornelia Sommaruga of Switzerland, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross from 1987 to 1998.</p>
        <p>The panel's chairman was Lakhdar Brahimi, a former foreign minister of Algeria who has served an international troubleshooter and envoy of the secretary general for nearly a decade in crises from Afghanistan to Haiti to Zaire, now Congo.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Brahimi drew on his own experiences to illustrate the weaknesses of the peacekeeping bureaucracy, which his report says needs to be transformed into a meritocracy -- not an easy task, he admits. For example, he said, in 1993, when he returned to New York from overseeing the end of apartheid in South Africa, he was asked to go immediately to Yemen, where a civil conflict had broken out.</p>
        <p>''The first thing I asked was, O.K., what do we have on Yemen?'' he said. ''The answer was, nothing. Not one thing.'' He had to buy his own research material, in Arabic, on the scene.</p>
        <p>One of the panel's central recommendations is the creation of a new information-gathering and analysis office within the United Nations to create databases and operate as a policy planning staff. In facing crises, the report recommends more honesty in assessing blame and less of a tendency to try to treat all sides of a dispute as equally responsible in an effort to appear impartial.</p>
        <p>Another core recommendation is the creation of an integrated task force for each mission that combines political analysis, military operations, civilian police, electoral assistance, aid to refugees and displaced people, public information, logistics, finance and recruitment. Mr. Brahimi said that the United Nations, with the help of member governments, needs to compile a roster of experts in many fields who are ready to go to places like Kosovo, Congo or East Timor to do development as well as peacekeeping work.</p>
