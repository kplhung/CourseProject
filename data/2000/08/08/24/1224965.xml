        <p>They used their best Yiddish, not just the Jew but the Southern Baptist as well. The band, a brassy if somewhat anemic quintet (you were expecting the Rolling Stones?), played a medley that ran from ''Rocky Top'' to ''Happy Days Are Here Again'' to ''Hava Nagila.'' And one adoring voter, a lady with silver hair and red lipstick, told America's first Jewish vice-presidential nominee that kissing his hand was ''like kissing the Torah.''</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, campaigned in southeast Florida for the first time today, setting off a frenzy at a largely Jewish community center and asserting that they would compete aggressively in this critical state.</p>
        <p>''I can't tell you how important Florida is,'' Mr. Lieberman told the crowd that filled an 800-seat auditorium in the Kings Point Community Center and flowed over into an adjacent room. ''I honestly believe that Al Gore and I are going to win Florida and as a result are going to win the election in November.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman were playing on long-established Democratic terrain today in a state that is by no means the Democratic stronghold it once was. But by traveling here -- Mr. Gore will be back in the state on Monday -- the new Democratic team was able to test its ability to excite party loyalists whose support will be vital in November.</p>
        <p>By all indications, they succeeded, with a pitch that emphasized their plans for a tax credit for long-term health care, for prescription drug benefits under Medicare, and for protecting Social Security. Their listeners rose to their feet with roars of approval several times, some leaning on walkers and canes, and mobbed the men after they finished.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Mr. Lieberman received an even warmer reception than Mr. Gore. Some wept with pride as they greeted him. Others called him a mensch. Sophie K. Gold, 72, said she was ''kvelling and ecstatic'' when Mr. Gore selected Mr. Lieberman. ''I felt 10 feet tall,'' she said, ''and very skinny.'' Representative Robert Wexler, who represents this area, said that Mr. Lieberman was regarded as ''a rock star, like Barbra Streisand'' in south Florida, and that his ability to turn out votes would make the Democrats surprisingly competitive as anybody could ever believe a Democratic ticket could be.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman did their best to speak the crowd's language. Mr. Lieberman introduced Mr. Gore as a ''Yiddishe neshoma,'' a Jewish soul. All the attention paid to his wife, Hadassah, and Mr. Gore's wife, Tipper, he said, made the candidates feel like ''nuchshleppers,'' or afterthoughts. Mr. Gore, for his part, greeted the crowd with a hearty ''shalom aleichem.''</p>
        <p>For the most part, the Democrats were playing to voters they had locked up before the Lieberman selection. And in any event, Jews comprised only 6 percent of the state's voters in 1996. The most recent public polls, taken before Mr. Gore's post-convention surge, showed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas with a double-digit lead in Florida.</p>
        <p>Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida, said she thought the state was in play but would give a slight edge to the Republicans. Mr. Gore, she said, is primarily ''coming to Florida to raise money and solidify his strongest supporters.'' David Colburn, a historian at the University of Florida, said Mr. Gore would have difficulty overcoming the popularity and organizational might of Mr. Bush's brother, Jeb, the state's governor, and in surmounting the state's business-oriented, antitax ethos.</p>
        <p>And yet, all indications are that Mr. Gore is making a serious play for Florida. His aides argue that the resources they are devoting to the state are too significant to be dismissed as a mere head fake aimed at seducing Mr. Bush into wasting time and money here. On Monday, Mr. Gore plans to travel to Tallahassee, where Jeb Bush sits as governor. Florida also is one of 17 key states where the campaign is broadcasting its first television advertisement, which began airing in three markets here on Tuesday. The ad is currently running in the Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach markets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush plans to visit Florida on Friday, and the advertisements he began broadcasting this week also are airing in Florida. ''We feel real good about our chances in Florida right now,'' said Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman.</p>
        <p>Florida is probably the largest state that both campaigns view as tightly contested. Mr. Gore holds an edge in California, a state with 54 electoral votes that President Clinton and Mr. Gore won in both 1992 and 1996. The same is true in New York, with 33 electoral votes, which has been won by Republicans only three times since 1960. Mr. Clinton won the state easily in the last two elections. Mr. Bush is expected to rout Mr. Gore in the governor's home state, Texas, which has 32 electoral votes. Two hundred and seventy electoral votes are needed to win.</p>
        <p>That leaves Florida, which has 25 electoral votes, and a history of fickleness in presidential elections. The Democrats won the state in 1996 and narrowly lost it in 1992. Once predominately Democratic, the state now has one United States senator from each party, and 15 Republicans and eight Democrats in its Congressional delegation.</p>
        <p>Some Florida Democrats worried that Mr. Gore had signaled his surrender in the state by not placing Senator Bob Graham on his short list of potential running mates. And Florida remains the locus of what is considered the vice president's most debilitating blunder -- his break with the White House in calling for permanent resident status for Elian Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>In a state where 18 percent of the population is 65 or older, the largest proportion of elderly in any state, Mr. Gore used today's appearance to promote his proposal for a $3,000 income tax credit for long-term care. The credit would go either to individuals whose disabilities or illnesses leave them unable to care for themselves, or to family members who pay for their relatives' care.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign estimates that up to five million Americans would be eligible for the credit. Aides to Mr. Gore project that the initiative would cost $27 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>The plan is one component of Mr. Gore's $500 billion menu of targeted tax cuts that would take effect over the next decade and would primarily benefit middle-class Americans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, by contrast, would cut taxes by $1.3 trillion over 10 years, primarily through an across-the-board reduction in income tax rates. The Bush plan includes a tax deduction for long-term care insurance premiums, at a cost of $5.1 billion over five years, and a new tax exemption, valued at $2,750, for each elderly spouse, parent or relative that a caregiver tends to in the home. That proposal would cost $2.3 billion over five years.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign released calculations today showing that the benefit for middle-income Americans, such as a couple earning $60,000 or a single mother earning $40,000, would be greater under Mr. Gore's plan than under Mr. Bush's plan.</p>
