        <p>As helicopters and rescue boats searched the Hudson River for two teenage boys from a state psychiatric center who were swept away Tuesday, investigators said today that a counselor who had been warned to keep them out of the water had led them down a steep, treacherous path to the river's edge.</p>
        <p>There, at a rocky outcropping where the Hudson and Croton Rivers converge -- a spot that local people said had been the site of many drownings over the years -- three of the six teenagers in the counselor's care suddenly leapt fully dressed into the treacherous crosscurrents, the police said.</p>
        <p>One boy managed to fight his way to shore right away, and the counselor, Lenox Gabriel, who had yelled for the boys to get out and then jumped in after them, was rescued by police officers. But as of late today, the two other boys,  Arimendi Lajara, 15, and Cedric Florence, 17, had still not been found. Mr. Gabriel told the police that they appeared to swim away from shore. Dozens of their relatives, some who came from as far away as Florida, gathered at the desolate site waiting for news. The Westchester County police said the boys' survival seemed unlikely.</p>
        <p>The police said the incident, in Croton Point Park, was being treated as an accident, although they wanted to speak again with Mr. Gabriel, 47, who was listed in stable condition tonight at Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in Sleepy Hollow. Officials there said he would not comment.</p>
        <p>''At this point they are not anticipating any criminal charges,'' Sgt. Donald F. McArthur said of detectives investigating the case. He said the detectives were interviewing the four other boys from the Brooklyn Children's Psychiatric Center, as well as three other counselors who were supervising them on the three-day trip.</p>
        <p>It is not clear, Sergeant McArthur said, where the other counselors were when the boys jumped into the river. He said Mr. Gabriel told investigators that he was the only adult with the six children at the time.</p>
        <p>One of the counselors called the park headquarters to report the emergency, and two police officers who had been in the park jumped in to rescue Mr. Gabriel.</p>
        <p>The State Office of Mental Health, which operates the Brooklyn psychiatric center and the group home on its grounds where the boys are temporarily living, is also investigating the incident, said Roger Klingman, a spokesman for the office. But those investigators had not yet interviewed Mr. Gabriel and had drawn no conclusions, Mr. Klingman said. ''We are still piecing this together.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gabriel told a detective late Tuesday that he had walked the boys down the near-vertical hill called Teller's Point at the southernmost tip of the park to take them on a hike, not to go swimming, the police said.</p>
        <p>The pathway is marked by rocks and tree roots that can be used as footholds. It is thickly wooded and takes great skill to navigate. ''No swimming'' signs are posted by the water, officials said, but the police said they were often removed by vandals. None were visible today.</p>
        <p>The counselors asked park officials if swimming was allowed, Sergeant McArthur said, and were told twice -- at check-in on Monday and earlier Tuesday -- that the water was off limits for bathing. Walking on the cliff, however, is not prohibited; anglers typically climb down to get a good fishing spot, he said.</p>
        <p>Today, helicopters buzzed overhead and a phalanx of boats scoured the violent waterway, until their blinking emergency lights were barely discernible through the gathering mist. Fog and rain shrouded the big state prison at Ossining, to the east, the Palisades cliffs to the west and the Tappan Zee Bridge to the south, landmarks that frame the triangular-shaped search area, 35 miles north of New York City.</p>
        <p>But with each passing hour, the prospect of a rescue looked less promising.</p>
        <p>''This is not a place for them,'' said Denise Peralta, 20, the cousin of Arimendi Lajara. She descended the cliff and peered into the one-foot swells to see the place where Arimendi vanished.</p>
        <p>She shook her head and said, ''He can't be alive.'' And then she began asking questions: How did the boys come to this spot? Why did they go into the water? Why was no permission sought for such a hike beforehand? Who was supervising?</p>
        <p>Carlise Florence, the mother of Cedric Florence, also walked to the river's edge with relatives, and  posed her own questions, specifically about the decision to bring such children to so remote and rugged a place as Croton Point Park. She said she asked Mr. Gabriel on Sunday not to allow her son on the trip because he did not want to go.</p>
        <p>''Think of supervision,'' said Maurice Patterson, Cedric's stepfather. ''There were four counselors here and there were six children. So that is enough to have two children to one counselor each and to have one counselor left over. How in the world did the counselor bring these children over there to the cliff, and how did they get down that cliff, to get in the water? They were not supervised.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Klingman, of the State Office of Mental Health, said the matter of proper supervision ''is a question we need to address in our investigation.'' But he would not speculate on whether any disciplinary action would be taken.</p>
        <p>The six boys on the outing are residents of an outpatient group home on the grounds of the psychiatric center, in Bedford-Stuvesant. The five-year-old home is a short-term or transitional center for emotionally troubled teenagers who require round-the-clock supervision rather than hospitalization, Mr. Klingman said. The children sometimes go home on weekends, and Arimendi  had been at a family barbecue Sunday.</p>
        <p>All of the counselors, who are state employees, must undergo background checks, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gabriel had been the manager of the residence for a little more than a year, and before that he was the manager of a nonprofit community residence, Mr. Klingman said.</p>
        <p>Cedric, one of the missing boys,  has dreams of becoming a United States marine, his mother said. The other boy, Arimendi, known as Ari,  enjoys playing basketball, handball and drawing Pokeman or Spiderman cartoons with colored pencils. He wants to become an artist, his brother Forito, 12, said.</p>
        <p>Cedric had been in the Brooklyn group home for eight months and was due to return home Sept. 8, Ms. Florence said. Arimendi was in the home for about four months and was also set to come home soon. By all accounts, both were doing well in the program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klingman said that he was not sure whether the Brooklyn home had made past trips to Croton Point Park, but that other group homes run by his agency had visited the park.  He said such outings were therapeutic for children, to involve them in ''normalizing activities.''</p>
        <p>Teller's Point, though, is anything but normal, said two local volunteer firefighters, Stephen Dominello, 34, and John O'Brien, 36, who monitored the search from the shore and told how they had recovered past victims from the waters, known as Crawbucky Bay.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't give you a second chance,'' said Mr. O'Brien, a diver who recovered the body of a 10-year-old boy from the same area in July 1995. ''It'll take you.''</p>
        <p>In a cabin where some of the boys had been staying, the two families hugged one another, cried, smoked cigarettes, paced and waited. The sound of the river lapping at the shore echoed through the cabin.</p>
