        <p>Umbria -- known as the green heart of Italy for its pastoral countryside and mountain wilderness -- is dotted with picturesque medieval hill towns like Perugia, Gubbio, Assisi, Todi and Spoleto. Perhaps the best way to experience Umbria is by exploring a town like Montone (large photo), where for the last 20 years an American artist and New York City resident, Daniel Lang, below, has spent half of his time. There will be an exhibition of his paintings at MB Modern, 41 East 57th Street, from Oct. 12 through 28, featuring Umbrian landscapes. Below, the view from his terrace in Montone.</p>
        <p>Better yet, spend five weeks taking drawing and painting classes, with the University of Tulsa School of Art. Next year's courses will run from mid-May to the end of June; enrollment is limited to 25; the cost is around $4,200, including airfare, room, dinner, six college credits and travel to Rome, Florence, Venice and Montone. Inquiries: (918) 631-2202 or by e-mail: stephen-sumner@utulsa.edu.</p>
