        <p>When the Mets lost by 15 runs on Tuesday and had to summon an outfielder to pitch, they knew their bullpen would be depleted the next day. Speaking after that game, Al Leiter seemed puzzled when asked if he would have to pitch any differently, to conserve pitches to last deep into the game.</p>
        <p>Leiter's expression seemed to ask if his questioner had noticed what he has done all year. Leiter, the Mets left-hander, has been consistently durable and effective; of course he would not deviate from that pattern.</p>
        <p>Leiter worked eight innings in a 4-1 victory over the San Diego Padres, allowing three hits and one run and matching a season high with 12 strikeouts. When the Qualcomm Stadium public-address system played The Cars' ''Just What I Needed'' in the seventh inning, it seemed an appropriate anthem for what Leiter had given the Mets.</p>
        <p>Leiter improved to 14-5, and he lasted long enough that the Mets had to use only one reliever, Armando Benitez, who recorded his 34th save. The Mets have an off-day today, and they should have a completely rested bullpen when they begin a three-game series with the Arizona Diamondbacks at Shea Stadium on Friday.</p>
        <p>Only one of Leiter's first seven pitches was a strike, and the eighth, to Damian Jackson, wound up over the fence in left-center for a home run. The bases were empty when he hit it, because Leiter had picked off the leadoff hitter, Eric Owens, after walking him. Leiter has nine pickoffs, tied with Arizona's Brian Anderson for the major league lead.</p>
        <p>After Jackson's home run, Leiter set down the next 14 Padres.</p>
        <p>The Mets were thin in the bullpen after Tuesday's 16-1 loss, which robbed them of their dignity -- outfielder Derek Bell gave up the final five runs -- and their bullpen depth. They considered promoting a pitcher as protection against a short start by Leiter, but they have only one reserve with options, Joe McEwing.</p>
        <p>Had the Mets sent McEwing down, they could not have brought him back for 10 days. ''McEwing is a pretty important part of the group,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said, but he added, ''Hopefully, I won't regret it.''</p>
        <p>He would not. In Leiter, the Mets had the right pitcher to give a lengthy outing. Leiter is third in the National League in pitches per start, averaging 112, and he is having a season that rivals that of any other pitcher in the league besides Randy Johnson.</p>
        <p>If only Leiter could hit. He is batting .063, and twice he came up with the bases loaded. In the fourth, he came up after Mike Bordick grounded a single under the glove of the diving third baseman, Phil Nevin, to drive in the Mets' first run. Had Leiter simply struck out, Lenny Harris would have come up. But Leiter bounced into a double play, ending the inning and keeping the score tied, 1-1.</p>
        <p>The Mets had started to get to Matt Clement, the 26-year-old right-hander who had baffled them twice this year. They went down in the fifth, one-two-three, but two of those outs came on highlight-worthy catches by Padres outfielders. And if the Mets were not hitting Clement, they were laying off his sharp breaking stuff.</p>
        <p>In the sixth, Mike Piazza and Darryl Hamilton drew leadoff walks. After an out, Benny Agbayani singled to load the bases, then Clement hit Bordick, the second batter he hit with a pitch in the game. The go-ahead run scored, and Leiter came up, chopping a bunt back to Clement, who flipped home for a forceout. Catcher Wiki Gonzalez threw to first and nearly doubled up Leiter, but the throw hit Leiter and another run scored.</p>
        <p>Harris singled in another run, putting the Mets ahead, 4-1, and Carlos Almanzar came in for Clement. He retired Bell on a pop-up, ending the inning and extending a lengthy slump by Bell. In 50 at-bats since his dramatic, game-tying homer at Houston on Aug. 7, Bell has five hits, a .100 average.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Mets second baseman EDGARDO ALFONZO missed his second game in a row tonight, this time with a stiff neck. Alfonzo's groin had given him problems on Tuesday. . . . The left-hander MIKE HAMPTON, who missed a start Tuesday because of the stress fracture in his right ribs, will throw in the bullpen Friday and could start Sunday, Manager BOBBY VALENTINE said. It is GLENDON RUSCH's turn to start on Sunday, and although Rusch's production has tailed off a bit lately, he will not be skipped if Hampton starts. . . . No players from the Mets organization were named to the United States Olympic team Wednesday, but one thought he had been. MARK JOHNSON, the Class AAA Norfolk first baseman, who spent time with the Mets this year, was surprised he was not chosen, especially after Norfolk issued a news release announcing that he had been. General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS said the Mets gave the Olympic Committee permission to select Johnson, but he understood that Johnson was not selected because of ''personal reasons.''</p>
