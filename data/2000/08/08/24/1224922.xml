        <p>The Clinton administration will soon unveil a revised approach to forest fires. Preliminary reports suggest that the policy will be smarter than past federal strategies, and much smarter than the recommendations flowing from President Clinton's opportunistic Republican critics.</p>
        <p>A great deal of nonsense has been spoken about the fires now raging across the Western United States. Emotional responses are inevitable when nearly five million acres are burning. But there is no cause for the political posturing in which some public figures have engaged.</p>
        <p>For example, the governor of Montana, the House speaker and the Republican candidate for president have all suggested that the administration's efforts to reduce logging on public lands have  made the forests more vulnerable to fire. They have also urged that Mr. Clinton's plan to ban road building in virtually all of the unprotected roadless areas of the national forests, about 43 million acres, be put on hold. Both arguments serve the timber industry and ignore reality. Some of the biggest fires are burning not in wilderness areas but on land that has been developed or logged.</p>
        <p>From what is known of the administration's deliberations, its revised strategy will concede past mistakes, though not those identified by its critics. It will recommend continuing the policy of prescribed fires, or deliberate burns. It will sound some cautionary notes about building subdivisions too close to nature. Finally, it will offer something new and expensive -- a plan to thin out the most fire-prone forests, maybe 40 million acres altogether, by removing underbrush and small trees while allowing mature, fire-resistant trees to remain.</p>
        <p>In general the policy makes sense, especially when set against the errors of the past. The main culprit for the present disaster is the Forest Service's policy of snuffing out fires on public lands as quickly as possible. This policy took root in 1910, after the so-called Big Burn in Idaho and Montana wiped out about three million acres, and in 1947 actually acquired a popular mascot, Smokey Bear.</p>
        <p>The policy's great flaw was that it disturbed the natural cycle in which fires periodically swept thorough forests, nourishing the soil and clearing out underbrush and small trees while sparing bigger trees. Suppressing these purgative blazes left forests choked with excess vegetation that provided vast amounts of fuel for future fires. Excessive logging had the same effect, removing the biggest and most fire-resistant trees and leaving crowded, fire-prone stands of young trees.</p>
        <p>The Smokey Bear approach was already losing credibility when a huge fire, fueled partly by dense underbrush, tore through almost half of Yellowstone National Park in 1988. Thereafter, and especially under the present Interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt, the government actually began setting fires in a pre-emptive effort to prevent bigger fires. Earlier this summer one planned fire, in Los Alamos, N.M., roared out of control. But the administration attributes the Los Alamos fire to poor execution, not the policy itself.</p>
        <p>The administration hopes that in time a combination of the new thinning-out strategy and the older prescribed-burn techniques will restore the nation's forests to less combustible levels of density. Thinning out the forests will require a lot of machinery, manpower and money. But it deserves reasoned debate, as far removed as possible from partisan sniping.</p>
