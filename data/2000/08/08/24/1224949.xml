        <p>President Clinton flew through the New Jersey suburbs today, shuttling from a horse farm here to a horse track in Cherry Hill -- with a stopover in Princeton that paralyzed the borough's streets at rush hour -- all to help a pair of Democrats facing uphill contests for the House of Representatives in two of the most closely watched races in the country.</p>
        <p>Mindful of his legacy, Mr. Clinton is eager for Democrats to retake control of Congress, and he spent much of the day with Representative Rush Holt, widely seen as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the House, before attending a fund-raiser in Cherry Hill for Susan Bass Levin, that town's mayor, who is giving Representative James H. Saxton, a 16-year incumbent, his first credible challenge.</p>
        <p>At a reception for Mr. Holt tonight, the president said the freshman congressman, a plasma physicist, was uniquely prepared to deal with issues of genetics, computer science and other emerging technologies. ''Even Republicans who may not agree with every vote he cast ought to think long and hard before they replace him,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''You need someone who really understands all these big, future issues.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Holt, who represents the wealthy, fast-growing 12th Congressional District in New Jersey's midsection, is in an unusual matchup: his opponent is Richard A. Zimmer, who held the seat for three terms until he gave it up to run for the Senate in 1996. It is difficult to say which man is enjoying an incumbent's traditional advantage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zimmer lost the Senate race to Robert G. Torricelli, but their acrimonious contest gave Mr. Zimmer a statewide profile, and he remains more familiar to residents in the Congressional district than Mr. Holt. According to one recent survey by the Holt campaign, nearly 70 percent of voters did not know who represented them, and a sizable number thought Mr. Zimmer still did.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zimmer now leads Mr. Holt by 6 to 12 points, depending on which candidate's internal polls are to be believed. Mr. Holt said he believed the gap was no reflection on his record. ''When I won in 1998, the other party just couldn't believe it, and they still can't accept it,'' he said in an interview. ''They are determined that this seat belonged to them, and that they are going to take it back.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Holt said his constituents had a rare opportunity to compare his record with Mr. Zimmer's. He pointed to accomplishments like securing $40 million in federal money for open-space preservation efforts, pushing to ban large trucks from two-lane roads, and lobbying for money to build schools and hire new teachers. ''I think I'm a good fit for this district,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The president appeared with Mr. Holt at a jazz and champagne reception for about 350 people in Hopewell, where Mr. Holt was introduced by Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic nominee for Senate. Mr. Holt, who gave an unusually spirited speech, began with a gibe at Mr. Corzine, who was little-known before his primary campaign.</p>
        <p>''The other day, Jon walked into a nursing home and asked, 'Do you know who I am?' '' Mr. Holt said. ''And they said, 'No, but if you go to the nurses' station over there, they'll tell you.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton later cautioned Mr. Holt, ''Rush, that joke you told was really funny, but really, I think it ought to be told by somebody like me who's not running again.''</p>
        <p>The reception was held on a 75-acre horse farm owned by Robert Stockman, a venture capitalist, and his wife, Lisa, who is involved in the Delaware and Raritan Canal Greenway, a land-preservation and water-quality advocacy group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holt's finance director, Neil Upmeyer, said the event would produce more than $250,000 for Mr. Holt's campaign, in addition to $1.8 million raised previously.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Holt is seen by both parties as one of the two most endangered Democratic incumbents in November, along with Michael Forbes of Long Island.</p>
        <p>Ms. Levin's campaign against Mr. Saxton in the Third Congressional District, meanwhile, is still seen as something of a long shot, even by New Jersey Democratic officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saxton has never faced a challenger with more than $1 million to spend, and Ms. Levin, a prominent fund-raiser for New Jersey Democrats, had raised more than $1.2 million for herself before tonight's event. The reception at the Garden State Park racetrack -- a reprise of a campaign stop Mr. Clinton made before his own election in 1992 -- was expected to draw 500 people and produce $200,000 for Ms. Levin, said Sallie Stohler, her campaign manager.</p>
        <p>Another measure of Ms. Levin's strength as a candidate came in June, when the New Jersey A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsed her after some debate, despite its predilection for backing incumbents.</p>
        <p>But David P. White, Mr. Saxton's campaign manager, said Mr. Saxton had received more in campaign contributions from union members than Ms. Levin had. And Mr. Saxton has also received the endorsements of the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters, which give him high marks for his record on water-quality issues. Moreover, Ms. Levin's campaign was shaken by a wholesale staff turnover a few weeks ago, in which her hard-driving personality was said to have played a part.</p>
        <p>''Levin's an incredible fund-raiser, and she's certainly proved her mettle, but Saxton's not inherently vulnerable,'' said Amy Walter, who analyzes House races for the Cook Political Report. ''He's been there a long time, and he hasn't done anything wrong. Incumbents have to help you. The district's trending Democratic, and if it were an open seat it'd be very competitive, but incumbents who lose to insurgent candidates are usually incumbents who don't take them seriously. And he's taking this one very seriously.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Holt, meanwhile, has stumbled already in his re-election campaign. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee last month began running advertisements in the district claiming that Mr. Zimmer had ''never voted for a single education funding bill. Not one.'' Mr. Holt defended the ads, but Mr. Zimmer's campaign persuaded a local cable system that they were inaccurate, and it refused to keep running them. A new ad began running this week stating that Mr. Zimmer ''voted over and over again to cut education funding.''</p>
