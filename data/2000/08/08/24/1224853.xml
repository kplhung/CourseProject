        <p>Gubbio, a TriBeCa restaurant named for the town in Umbria, is decorated with ceramic pitchers made since the 1800's by the Baffoni family of Umbria. The restaurant also sells the pitchers. The basic shapes date from the 15th century, when local monks used similar pitchers for wine, water and oil, said Giorgio Meriggi, an owner of Gubbio. The two-handled, 12-inch pitcher at left is made for wine ($250). Nine other designs range from 6 inches to 24 inches high, and from $75 to $500. All are available at the restaurant, serving specialties from Umbria at 223 West Broadway (White Street);(212) 334-8077.</p>
