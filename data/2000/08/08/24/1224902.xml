        <p>President Abdurrahman Wahid unveiled a revamped cabinet today in a move to revitalize his faltering administration and tackle acute social and economic woes that are threatening to tear Indonesia apart.</p>
        <p>The new lineup had been widely expected since Mr. Wahid promised an angry national assembly two weeks ago that he would make significant changes to improve his erratic performance and leadership style -- issues that had concerned some legislators so much that they had demanded that he step down.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid announced that he was cutting his cabinet to 26 ministers from 35 and that the group would include eight new people. Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri will supervise the new team and run the day-to-day business of the government, a move that legislators had also demanded. Mr. Wahid had said earlier that he wanted to concentrate on foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>Since taking office in October 1999, Mr. Wahid has been criticized for failing to turn around Indonesia's worst economic slide in decades. He was also blamed for failing to end corruption in his government, stop a violent religious war in the eastern Moluccan Islands and halt separatist movements in far-flung provinces.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem, Mr. Wahid said, was the larger cabinet; it had been made up of politicians from main factions of the People's Consultative Assembly, which put him into power. He said that the setup had immediately created disunity as political rivalries and self-interests paralyzed the government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid said in brief comments to reporters on Tuesday that his new team was mainly composed of professionals who would concentrate on  results, not politics. ''My consideration was that they must be experts in their fields,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, the appointment of Rizal Ramli, the head of Bulog, Indonesia's national food distribution agency, and Priyadi Praptosuharjo, a banker, to run Mr. Wahid's economic team raised concern among some analysts. Earlier this year Mr. Wahid had nominated Mr. Priyadi, the new finance minister, to run a state-owned bank, but he was ruled ineligible because of his earlier involvement with a bank that had failed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid defended his appointments, saying, ''I know exactly about Priyadi because I have had observations about him for 16 years.''</p>
        <p>The president did not reappoint his economic minister, Kwik Kian Gie, who resigned last week, or the finance minister, Bambang Sudibyo. He named Soesilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the current mines and energy minister, to the coveted post of coordinating minister for political and security affairs.</p>
