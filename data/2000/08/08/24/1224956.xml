        <p>The 500 life-size fiberglass cows that arrived on New York City streets in June have inspired impassioned opinions. Some people welcome the herd, with their imaginative designs by local artists. Others consider the whole cow parade just a hokey import from Chicago.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the cows inspired some old-fashioned rustling.</p>
        <p>''Cow Hands,'' one of the creatures in town for the parade, and apparently the ideal tool for a practical joke, was unfastened from its concrete base at West Houston Street and La Guardia Place early yesterday morning.</p>
        <p>The police arrived as ''Cow Hands'' was about to be loaded into a blue Jeep Cherokee. The officers found Patrick Kraft, 24, of East Windsor, N.J., and Michael Macisco, 23, of Stratford, Conn., clearing their Jeep, apparently to make way for the cow, the police said.</p>
        <p>''As I got closer to the Jeep, I could see that a statue of a cow'' was leaning against it, Detective Andrew McDermott said. While the two men were caught cow-handed, the police said, they initially denied having anything to do with the blue and purple stray, covered with white handprints. Detective McDermott said the two soon confessed to plotting a prank. They told the police that they were probably going to station ''Cow Hands'' in front of a friend's Manhattan home, he said.</p>
        <p>By yesterday afternoon, ''Cow Hands'' stood silently in the Sixth Precinct station house, on West 10th Street, where she was to be kept for 48 hours as evidence. Her green eyes pointed at the front desk, which she appeared poised to charge. A stolen-property invoice was fastened to her back with tape, in lieu of a brand.</p>
        <p>Snapping a Polaroid picture for the station house scrapbook, Officer Jon Goldin shook his head, saying that when he first saw the cow at the station house, he figured that it was a prop in a publicity stunt. ''Well, that's life in a big city,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The bounty for ''Cow Hands'' is quite hefty. Officials from the city and CowParade Holdings, the parade organizers, were hoping that ''Cow Hands'' would fetch $20,000 to $50,000 at an auction planned for Sept. 28, whose proceeds are to be donated to six charities.</p>
        <p>''Cow Hands'' was painted by the artist Edwina Sandys, who is Winston Churchill's granddaughter.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what the punishment should be for such a crime,'' Ms. Sandys mused after learning of the attempted theft. She suggested that the guilty parties do time ''working on a farm or something.''</p>
        <p>The police said the two men were charged with grand larceny, criminal possession of stolen property and criminal mischief.</p>
        <p>Since the cow parade began in June, about 50 of the 500 cows have been damaged, said Jerome Elbaum, president of CowParade Holdings. In late June, the police found that the colorful ''Moo-Stripa'' had been removed from her spot in Richmond Hill, Queens. ''Moo-Stripa'' has since been recovered.</p>
        <p>Last week, the police arrested three New York teenagers for a rural form of mischief: cow-tipping, in John Jay Park in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>At a news conference yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said, ''Given the fact that on any given day you have 11 million people in the city, the way in which the cows were treated was very respectful.''</p>
