        <p>An article on Aug. 10 about a slowing in the increase of the nation's prison population misstated the number of federal inmates sentenced on various types of charges in 1998. The article substituted 1990 figures from the Justice Department report. Actually, of the 108,925 inmates in federal prisons in 1998, 63,011 (not 30,470) were charged with drug crimes, 12,656 (not 7,557) were charged with violent offenses and 8,627 (not 7,935) were charged with property crimes.</p>
