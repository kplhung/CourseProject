        <p>The upper 22 floors of the Downtown Athletic Club building near Battery Park in Manhattan have been sold to a developer who intends to convert them into luxury condominiums, furthering the hectic makeover of the financial district to high-end residential use.</p>
        <p>The $21 million deal does not directly involve the financially struggling club, which occupies the bottom 13 floors of the 35-story building at 19 West Street. The structure is best known as the home of college football's Heisman Trophy, which the club awards each year to the sport's top player.</p>
        <p>Last year, in a complex agreement with the bankrupt club's creditors, the high-rise was sold for $16 million to a Connecticut real estate investment firm, which in turn sold 13 floors back to the nonprofit organization for $8 million.</p>
        <p>The upper floors included a boxing ring, but had been used mainly as overnight rooms for members, whose numbers have dropped drastically over the years. The arrangement allowed the club to pay its bills without going out of business or having the Art Deco building auctioned by the Bankruptcy Court.</p>
        <p>The firm, Cheslock, Bakker &amp; Associates of Stamford, had planned to convert the upper floors into a hotel. But Bill Jacobs, Cheslock's managing director, said the market for luxury condominiums became too lucrative to resist. Cheslock sold the 22 floors last Thursday to Jack Lefkowitz, a Brooklyn developer who specializes in residential conversions.</p>
        <p>''This building was a cultural icon and we saved it,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''We are not in the business to create monuments. We have sold it at a very handsome profit.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lefkowitz, who began work on the renovations Monday, said he planned to spend $20 million gutting the 22 floors and replacing them with 30 or so condominiums, some as large as 4,000 square feet. With views of the Statue of Liberty, the units are expected to sell for $1,000 per square foot.</p>
        <p>The city's Landmarks Preservation Commission is expected to designate the building a historic landmark this fall, which would protect the exterior from most alterations. Mr. Lefkowitz said that he supported the designation, and that his remodeling plans did not call for changes to the exterior.</p>
        <p>The building is between two luxury residential towers and faces Battery Park City, where a new Ritz-Carlton hotel and high-rise residential development are under way. Despite a recent resurgence in office rentals,  the area remains a residential hot spot, said Judy Duffy, assistant district manager for Community Board 1. In the last three years, she said,  there have been 5,800 residential conversions in the financial district, and the pace is not letting up.</p>
        <p>''For some reason, this particular corner is the latest trend for residential conversions,'' Ms. Duffy said. ''The offices are coming back -- we've had some reversals, residential going back to office -- but the area west of Broadway and south of the World Trade Center has all of a sudden become the next place for residential conversions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lefkowitz said he had no financial stake in the Downtown Athletic Club, but he expected to help spruce up the organization's historic but mostly worn quarters. The club has a large swimming pool, basketball and squash courts, exercise rooms and a restaurant and bar. It keeps the Heisman Trophy in the lobby.</p>
        <p>Joe Carnicelli, a spokesman for the club, said the organization was trying to get back on its feet after several tumultuous years. In the latest twist, it had to go to court to evict two businessmen who had been living in athletic club rooms on the 35th floor and refused to leave, he said.</p>
        <p>The club is looking for business partners to update and run the facilities and is trying to expand its membership beyond Wall Street to the district's new residents. There are now about 1,200 members, he said, down from 3,800 in the 1930's.</p>
        <p>''It is a constant battle,'' Mr. Carnicelli said. ''I don't think the battle is over. We keep fighting it.''</p>
