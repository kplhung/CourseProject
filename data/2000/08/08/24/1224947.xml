        <p>Reacting to the abrupt resignation of the city's acting buildings commissioner, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that there were ''substantive problems'' with the Buildings Department and that the commissioner had made ''the right decision.''</p>
        <p>The commissioner, Richard C. Visconti, quit on Tuesday after Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota phoned him at his home in Queens at 6:30 a.m. to complain about an article in that day's Daily News. The article reported that the facades of 68 buildings had been listed by the department as unsafe and in need of immediate repair. Last month, a tourist in Midtown Manhattan suffered a fractured skull when a 25-pound stucco ornament loosened from a Seventh Avenue office building and fell 14 stories.</p>
        <p>''We agreed that I would resign,'' Mr. Visconti said. ''I resigned.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Visconti met later on Tuesday morning with Mr. Lhota in City Hall, then submitted a two-sentence letter of resignation. He said yesterday that the Daily News article was not the reason for his departure. ''I was planning to leave because I was not going to be appointed commissioner,'' Mr. Visconti said. ''It was made clear to me by the administration.''</p>
        <p>The mayor, though, said: ''I don't think I would have fired him. He wanted to resign.'' He said that the resignation of Mr. Visconti ''was not something that I asked for.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Visconti, 53, a former partner at Beyer Blinder Belle, an architectural firm in Manhattan, was acting commissioner for 15 months, but was never close to Mr. Giuliani and had a tense relationship with City Hall. Yesterday, the mayor made no positive remarks about his tenure. Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Visconti's departure and the appointment of a new commissioner ''may be an opportunity to have the Buildings Department go through a complete reinvention and reform.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani cited problems with high turnover and ''persistent corruption'' in the agency. Over the years, the department has been plagued by numerous corruption scandals, particularly in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Under Mayor Giuliani, budget cuts have reduced the number of inspectors, forcing the agency to depend on a system in which engineers and architects hired by a building's owner certify the work on a building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Visconti said yesterday that although the 68 buildings had an unsafe status, the buildings' owners had in many cases erected sheds or scaffolding to shield pedestrians.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said he would move swiftly to name a commissioner.</p>
