        <p>The fire that burned right up to my house this year was different than those that leveled more than 65 of my neighbors' homes in recent days. I set it myself to give me a bit of buffer against summer's big fires.</p>
        <p>Still, as blankets of smoke stretch to every horizon line in my valley and a single afternoon's lightning sets 100 new fires in western Montana, I spend my days watching the ridges for bolts close to home and wondering if I have done enough.</p>
        <p>Through decades of research, ecologists have established that a century's worth of suppressing fires has left the West glutted in trees, which is to say fuel. That was certainly true of my own land, so I hired a man to log it. This would seem to place me in the camp of those haranguing the government to open the national forests to more logging. I am not. Despite what Montana's governor and his timber allies would have us believe, fires thrive on the sick and scrawny trees left behind by commercial loggers, who take the big, fat valuable logs. I did the opposite, keeping the big trees.</p>
        <p>There is a barely hidden agenda in the pro-logging harangue, having to do with President Clinton's decision last year to prevent logging on 50 million acres of the remaining unroaded public forest lands. Building roads and turning loggers loose in these wild places would be a disaster even greater than suppressing fires. Those lands are well away from houses, vast and buffered. We can restore these places with fire alone. The timber companies are using the fires as a wedge to gain access to wilderness.</p>
        <p>For the record, the Forest Service warned us not to line those timbered ridges with trophy houses, but we built them anyhow. For more than a decade, the agency's firefighters have been saying that in a drought year they would be powerless to stop the infernos.</p>
        <p>Years ago, because we believed we were sufficiently wise to rework nature, we began fighting forest fires, creating the bomb that now must be defused. Demanding now that fires be conducted in an orderly fashion is like ordering lions to become vegetarians.</p>
        <p>The 20 acres I burned around my house this spring are recovering now. The grand old ponderosa pines, evolved as they are to resist fire, were spared, clearing the way for a bloom of wildflowers and grasses. That happens after fires. I have done what I can to make my peace with my place. Now what happens will happen.</p>
