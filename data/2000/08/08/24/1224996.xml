        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Appliance With a Purpose'' (State of the Art, Aug. 17), about the iPAQ IA-1 Internet appliance, says the role model for such appliances is the television because it doesn't require ''a lot of technical hocus-pocus.'' I've been programming VCR's since the early 1980's, but at least 1 time out of 10, when I've finished programming, I forget to turn off the VCR so it can come on automatically at the specified time. I forget because it's easy to forget and, in any case, counterintuitive to turn off something so that it will work.</p>

        <p>When we refinished the hardwood in the living room the other week, I had to unplug the spaghetti of wiring behind the TV cart. Later, of course, I plugged things back in, but the setup -- which included three cables going into one connecting device -- didn't work correctly until I played around with the wiring and the connectors and the buttons and the on-screen setup. TV watching is too complicated! Give me computing!</p>
