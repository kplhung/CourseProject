        <p>The Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York announced yesterday that it had signed a letter of intent to sell its troubled Florida subsidiary to a group of health companies.</p>
        <p>Officials at HIP would not disclose the price. But business analysts estimated that HIP would recover only a fraction of the $80 million that it had invested in the subsidiary.</p>
        <p>HIP officials said they would use money from the sale to bolster their New York operation, which also faces financial problems.</p>
        <p>Florida regulators placed the subsidiary, HIP Health Plan of Florida, under special supervision last month. They also had given its New York parent until Aug. 15 to make up a $4.8 million shortfall in the subsidiary's reserves.</p>
        <p>The Florida operation had had trouble competing with larger H.M.O.'s. And regulators in New York recently told HIP that it could not send any more money to Florida to subsidize the losses.</p>
        <p>HIP said the buyer would be a group of health companies led by Dr. Steven C. Scott, who runs H.M.O.'s in Durham, N.C.; Miami; and Tallahassee, Fla. Under the deal, the reserves at the HIP subsidiary would be replenished, and there would be no change in its medical services.</p>
