        <p>Left wing Taylor Pyatt, the No. 8 overall pick in the 1999 draft, was signed by the Islanders yesterday to a three-year contract.</p>
        <p>We have him as a tall and good-skating winger we hope can become a power forward, General Manager Mike Milbury said.</p>
        <p>Pyatt, 6 feet 3 inches and 221 pounds, has spent the past three seasons in the Ontario Hockey League and was named a first-team all-star after scoring 40 goals and 89 points for the Sudbury Wolves this past season. The 18-year-old also scored 8 goals and 15 points in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>I think I'm ready for the N.H.L., Pyatt said from Calgary, where he is at the Team Canada evaluation camp for the World Junior Championships. The Islanders have set the table for me -- I want to be in the best shape I can for training camp.</p>
        <p>Milbury cautioned that there will be plenty of competition at left wing, naming Brad Isbister, Raffi Torres, Mats Lindgren, Mike Stapleton and Claude Lapointe as contenders.</p>
        <p>We see Taylor eventually as a top line offensive forward -- whether his time is now remains to be seen, said Milbury, who said the team was working on a deal with Branislav Mezei, the only remaining unsigned draft choice from 1999. He added the team has discontinued talks with Torres, the Islanders' second pick in the 2000 draft, until after training camp.</p>
        <p>Still unsigned are the restricted free agents Kenny Jonsson, Roman Hamrlik, Isbister, Zdeno Chara, Ray Giroux and Dmitiri Nabokov.</p>
