        <p>There is a faintly bittersweet atmosphere at the Santa Fe Opera this summer, the company's 44th season and its last under the directorship of its founder, John Crosby. Mr. Crosby, 74, has asked the company not to make too much of his retirement, and that wish is largely being honored. When the subject is mentioned, it is mostly in the context of plans for next season, to be directed by his successor, Richard Gaddes.</p>
        <p>Still, few opera companies have been so closely associated with a single person, and for so long. And it is not lost on anyone here that Mr. Crosby's vision has been the primary draw for the 60 percent of the company's audience that comes from outside New Mexico. Having built (and rebuilt and revamped) an attractive, acoustically superb open-air opera house in the mountains here, he has filled its stage with a careful balance of standard repertory, rarities and new operas, including nearly 50 world or American premieres.</p>

        <p>There is a faintly bittersweet atmosphere at the Santa Fe Opera this summer, the company's 44th season and its last under the directorship of its founder, John Crosby. Mr. Crosby, 74, has asked the company not to make too much of his retirement, and that wish is largely being honored. When the subject is mentioned, it is mostly in the context of plans for next season, to be directed by his successor, Richard Gaddes.</p>
        <p>Still, few opera companies have been so closely associated with a single person, and for so long. And it is not lost on anyone here that Mr. Crosby's vision has been the primary draw for the 60 percent of the company's audience that comes from outside New Mexico. Having built (and rebuilt and revamped) an attractive, acoustically superb open-air opera house in the mountains here, he has filled its stage with a careful balance of standard repertory, rarities and new operas, including nearly 50 world or American premieres.</p>
        <p>This summer the company adds Hans Werner Henze's ''Venus and Adonis'' to the American-premiere column of its ledger, where it joins five of Mr. Henze's earlier works. On Wednesday evening the company gave the second of three performances of the opera. The last is to be on Aug. 11.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the Shakespearean poem, Mr. Henze and his librettist, Hans-Ulrich Treichel, have expanded the story into an operatic psychodrama with an exquisitely ornate structure. Dance, operatic vocal writing and madrigals for a six-voice choir alternate in a series of 17 short scenes lasting 70 minutes.</p>
        <p>The opera's design calls to mind the masques of Purcell's time, although Mr. Henze's variegated score inhabits a different musical universe, with its dense layering, dreamlike textures and stretches of both gritty dissonance and touching lyricism.</p>
        <p>The work is set in several worlds. One describes a mythological triangle, evoked by dancers: Mars lusts after Venus, who rejects him in favor of Adonis. Adonis is too self-absorbed and free-spirited to notice, but when he finally responds, after encountering mating horses that awaken his own sexuality, he is killed by a wild boar.</p>
        <p>A parallel story, evoked in vocal music, shows three singers, Prima Donna, the Hero-Player and Clemente, rehearsing an opera about Venus, Mars and Adonis. The attractions and tensions between the mythological characters are mirrored in the singers' relationships, and at the moment the boar kills Adonis, the Hero-Player stabs Clemente. The libretto, in German, sometimes conveys the singers' thoughts and sometimes those of Venus, Mars and Adonis; emotionally, they are identical.</p>
        <p>The cast is equal to the work's complexities. Stephen West's solid bass-baritone drips with the Hero-Player's (and Mars') bitterness and frustration, just as Christopher Ventris's tenor evokes Clemente's (and Adonis') innocence. Both sing Mr. Henze's angular lines with an Expressionistic edge. Lauren Flanigan, as Prima Donna (and Venus), moves beyond that angularity, sometimes giving her music a Straussian gloss that suggests her characters' seductiveness.</p>
        <p>The principal dancers -- Peter Mantia as a mechanical, posing Mars; Brock vonDrehle Labrenz as a fluid, naturalistic Adonis; and Sarita Allen as a limber, predatory Venus -- executed Ron Thornhill's choreography with corresponding vividness.</p>
        <p>Alfred Kirchner's production is set in a spare, whitewashed rehearsal-room set by John Conklin, with eye-catching if slightly motley costumes by David C. Woolard. And Richard Bradshaw conducted an energetic reading of Mr. Henze's complex score.</p>
        <p>The friction between sexuality and innocence is also at the heart of Verdi's ''Rigoletto,'' which the company is offering in a new production by Mikael Melbye, a young Danish baritone who has taken up directing. Mr. Melbye's Mantua is clean, uncluttered and traditional, but what enlivened the performance on Monday evening was the degree to which Mr. Melbye had persuaded his singers to step beyond familiar characterizations.</p>
        <p>Kim Josephson's Rigoletto, for example, was less twisted and mean-spirited than most, and as a result his anguish was more sharply defined. In the scene in which he harassed the unfortunate Monterone, this Rigoletto knew immediately that he had gone too far. He was pierced by Monterone's curse the second it was uttered.</p>
