        <p>Larry Ruffner and his buddies live to lounge in the great outdoors. From April until October, Mr. Ruffner and his friends spend their days roasting weenies, drinking beer and swatting mosquitoes in a lushly forested campground near their western Pennsylvania home.</p>
        <p>''We don't let nothing get in the way of our camping,'' said Mr. Ruffner, 63, a retired truck driver from Mount Pleasant. ''This is what the good life is all about.''</p>
        <p>So when Mr. Ruffner's wife and some friends wanted to go to New York City for a marathon weekend of shopping and Broadway shows, there was no question where they would stay. The Ruffners and two other couples hitched up their trailers, headed north on the New Jersey Turnpike and set up house in what must be one of the world's most urbanized campgrounds, Liberty Harbor R.V. Park, a treeless patch of crab grass and concrete that sits across a small canal from Liberty State Park in the shadow of the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>As the setting sun set Manhattan's skyline ablaze one evening last month, Mr. Ruffner and his friends tried to ignore the wailing sirens, the roar of overhead planes and the acres of surrounding asphalt as they recovered from a harried day of sightseeing and stargazing (celebrities, not celestial bodies).</p>
        <p>''To be honest, I like to see some trees when I camp,'' said Buck Sinclair, a steel mill supervisor, as he sat on the AstroTurf spread amid the couples' small caravan of pop-up trailers. ''But at least there ain't any bugs here.''</p>
        <p>For the recreational vehicle set, that nomadic tribe of Americans who live to camp -- albeit with VCR, microwave and satellite dish in tow -- Liberty Harbor R.V. Park is one of the nation's best-kept secrets. For $50 a night per vehicle, as many bodies as can cram into a camper can sample overpriced New York and still end the day with a marshmallow roast and money in the pocket. Even with the steep price of gasoline -- most of the vehicles get only 7 to 10 miles a gallon -- a trip to New York can be a relative bargain.</p>
        <p>Wedged among acres of brown fields, a scrap metal plant and an expansive parking lot, the campground can accommodate 60 recreational vehicles and is often full during summer. Once their lumbering behemoths are safely parked, the inhabitants spend their days in Manhattan, getting there by PATH train or via a New York Waterways ferry that docks at the adjacent marina. It may lack the charm of Yellowstone and cost twice as much as most R.V. parks, but where else can a camper doze off while gazing at the Statue of Liberty's backside?</p>
        <p>Living on a minister's salary in Durham, N.C., Al Huffman thought he could never afford to bring his wife and three children to New York, what with air fare, $200-a-night hotel rooms and $7.59 hamburgers at the Hard Rock Cafe. Determined to see the city, Mr. Huffman bought a used Jayco pop-up camper and an old Chevy van and piled everyone in for the 14-hour drive. ''We decided to bring our own hotel,'' he said, showing off the fully equipped kitchen, the shower and the commode. ''We've seen two Broadway shows and the whole trip is only going to cost us $700. We feel like we're cheating.''</p>
        <p>Liberty R.V. Park's owners said that they never intended to open a motor home refuge on the Hudson.  Jeffrey Zak, a real estate executive whose company owns the 80-acre park, said the business was born five years ago when out-of-town boaters began showing up at the marina with trailers and tents.</p>
        <p>''We get a kick out of it,'' said Mr. Zak, who added that camping customers barely paid for the taxes on the property. But he said the Air Streams and pup tents were not long for this bit of earth. In the next three to five years, they will give way to Liberty Harbor North, a neo-traditional city of 6,000 apartments and a few million square feet of commercial space.</p>
        <p>''At the very least, it's shown us that there is a huge potential for tourism in New Jersey,'' he said. ''Because of them, we're thinking of building a hotel here.''</p>
        <p>The demise of the park will leave outdoorsmen with nowhere to pitch a tent in metropolitan New York. The closest campground is in Newburgh, N.Y., about 60 miles north of Manhattan. ''New York City just doesn't lend itself to R.V.-ing,'' said David Gorin, president of the National Association of R.V. Parks and Campgrounds. ''It's not like you can just drive into New York and expect to find two parking spaces next to each other.''</p>
        <p>Graceanne and Clark Keysor from Clearwater, Fla., would require more than two parking spaces for their 32-foot Winnebago, which pulled in one afternoon hauling two mountain bikes and a catamaran behind it. As Mr. Keysor hooked up the power and mounted a rooftop satellite dish for their two televisions, Mrs. Keysor talked about the joys of cross-country motoring, which keeps the couple busy seven months a year.</p>
        <p>''You never need to unpack, and when you visit friends, you don't have to sleep in their beds,'' she said. ''You park in their driveway, but after dessert, you can put your head on your own pillow.''</p>
        <p>Since they retired from the wholesale furniture business three years ago, the Keysors have driven 72,000 miles though 40 states, including Alaska. Her only complaint? ''I wish this thing had a washer and dryer,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Although retired Americans dominate the scene, Liberty R.V. Park draws its share of youthful foreign travelers who know a good deal when they see one. Some of them live out of trailers they rent through a local  service; the service delivers the trailers to Newark International Airport when the visitors arrive. (A fully equipped 23-foot Coachmen sleeping six costs about $1,000 per week.)</p>
        <p>The Hansen family of Denmark picked up a motor home in Chicago. Even after three weeks on the road, Kirsten Dyrholm Hansen, 42, seemed a bit overwhelmed by their rolling road house, a Chevrolet Flyer that comfortably sleeps six. ''I have never seen such a construction before,'' she said. ''I don't think they are allowed in Denmark.''</p>
        <p>Despite a few mishaps, including several unintended incursions onto restricted parkways, the Hansens and their two children, Lea, 18, and Lars, 16, were clearly enjoying their stay in New Jersey. They had already seen the stock exchange, taken the Staten Island ferry and strolled through the canyons of Lower Manhattan. But the highlight of their visit so far, they said, was arriving at the campground the previous night to find themselves in a storm of flashing strobes. They were the lights on a dozen emergency vehicles, drawn by the discovery of a body that had washed up in the marina. The victim was an apparent suicide, they were told.</p>
        <p>Erling Orskov Hansen, 43, an accountant, wondered aloud why all his campground neighbors were inside their trailers watching cable television. ''We don't have such sights in Denmark,'' he said. ''At least not the dead bodies.''</p>
