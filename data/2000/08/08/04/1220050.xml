        <p>Luis Polonia said it was the only at-bat of his 11-year career that he truly remembers. Paul O'Neill was panicked about whether he would catch the soaring line drive. Andy Pettitte put a towel over his head and prayed.</p>
        <p>And Joe Torre thought he was watching a movie.</p>
        <p>When Polonia returned to the Yankees for the third time yesterday, it was natural to reminisce about his amazing battle with John Wetteland during Game 5 of the 1996 World Series. Polonia wound up hitting a shot to right-center field, and O'Neill wound up making a terrific catch to preserve a 1-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.</p>
        <p>But there was so much more that happened on Oct. 24, 1996, a night when Wetteland would not stop throwing fastballs, when Polonia would not stop fouling them off and when the series between the Yankees and the Braves was reduced to a scintillating one-on-one matchup. It was Wetteland against Polonia, winner helps his team take the lead in the series. ''It was probably the greatest at-bat I've had in my career,'' said Polonia, who led off and played left field for the Yankees last night against Kansas City. ''Knowing who was pitching and the situation. I kept fouling balls off. I wanted to get a hit. I just kept fighting back.''</p>
        <p>With Chipper Jones on third and two out in the ninth, Torre made a daring move by intentionally walking Ryan Klesko to place the potential winning run on base. Bobby Cox countered by having Polonia pinch-hit for Jermaine Dye. That is when the excitement started. Pettitte, who had started and pitched brilliantly, could not even watch.</p>
        <p>''I had my head down, praying,'' Pettitte said. ''I just wanted Wetteland to get him out. It was a great at-bat, a feisty at-bat. I didn't care if he had to throw him a knuckleball. Just get him out.''</p>
        <p>Wetteland's strategy was to throw fastballs to Polonia, a great fastball hitter who has a small strike zone because he is 5 feet 8 inches. Polonia fouled off the first pitch and the second and the third. All the foul balls sailed straight back or over the third-base dugout, a sign that Polonia was probably not going to pull Wetteland's fastball to right or down the line.</p>
        <p>Jose Cardenal, the first-base coach and outfield instructor, jumped to the top step of the dugout and waved to O'Neill. Cardenal repositioned O'Neill about eight feet toward right-center. Those eight steps changed the outcome of the game, the series and Yankee history. O'Neill, Polonia and Torre mentioned Cardenal's name first when they were asked what they remembered about Polonia's duel with Wetteland. After O'Neill shifted, the duel continued. Wetteland fired a fourth and a fifth fastball to Polonia. His bat was still quick, and he flicked them for fouls balls.</p>
        <p>''That seemed like it lasted about 30 minutes,'' shortstop Derek Jeter said. ''When someone keeps fouling off pitches like that, you know he's going to hit it well. That could have turned the whole series around.''</p>
        <p>Torre sat in the third-base dugout at Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium for the final game at the ballpark and wondered: was this at-bat really happening? ''It was like a movie scene,'' he said. ''It was power against power, Bob Welch against Reggie Jackson. Who is going to win this thing? In essence, they both did. He hit it hard. That's all you can do.''</p>
        <p>Wetteland thought about trying to fool Polonia with a breaking pitch, but he quickly recalled how Mark Wohlers had thrown a slider to Jim Leyritz in Game 4. Leyritz had belted it for a three-run homer.</p>
        <p>Wetteland did not want to get beat with his second-best pitch, so he threw a sixth fastball and Polonia fouled that one off, too. Then Wetteland fired his seventh fastball and Polonia whacked it.</p>
        <p>''He hit a bullet,'' Pettitte said. ''I remember it like it was yesterday.''</p>
        <p>Polonia did hit a bullet. The ball zoomed toward right-center, and O'Neill, who had a severely strained left hamstring, took off with it. Initially, O'Neill thought he would catch it, but he said it ''took off on me and I panicked.''</p>
        <p>Polonia said he figured there was ''no way'' O'Neill would catch the liner, even though he had watched Cardenal shift him earlier. But O'Neill lunged and caught the ball in his outstretched glove near the warning track.</p>
        <p>O'Neill pounded his hand against the fence and screamed. Polonia was stunned.</p>
        <p>''That could have changed the complexion of the series,'' Jeter said. ''That could have changed the complexion of the future.''</p>
        <p>Indeed. Who knows if the Yankees would have won that World Series or two of the next three titles if O'Neill had not made that catch?</p>
        <p>Things changed for Polonia as well. He played in Mexico for the next two years. Polonia said he doubts he would have been without a job in the majors had O'Neill missed the liner and had the Braves won.</p>
        <p>''That at-bat sent me to Mexico,'' Polonia said. ''Thanks a lot, Paul.''</p>
