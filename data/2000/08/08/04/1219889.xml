        <p>''Elizabeth has a heart the size of a mountain,'' Gail says about one of her sisters in ''Better Living.'' In this movie, everyone has a heart the size of a mountain, and most of the characters make as much noise as a rock slide. If you've missed the kind of bellowing in a comedic context that disappeared with the Norman Lear sitcoms -- called scream theater in the 1970's -- then this is the movie for you.</p>
        <p>''Better Living'' is one of those comedy-dramas in which everyone is a little crazy in a way that is intended to be ingratiating until a horrible family secret is revealed. Skin-deep quirkiness is not always adorable, however, especially when everyone has been conceived as a ''character.''</p>

        <p>''Elizabeth has a heart the size of a mountain,'' Gail says about one of her sisters in ''Better Living.'' In this movie, everyone has a heart the size of a mountain, and most of the characters make as much noise as a rock slide. If you've missed the kind of bellowing in a comedic context that disappeared with the Norman Lear sitcoms -- called scream theater in the 1970's -- then this is the movie for you.</p>
        <p>''Better Living'' is one of those comedy-dramas in which everyone is a little crazy in a way that is intended to be ingratiating until a horrible family secret is revealed. Skin-deep quirkiness is not always adorable, however, especially when everyone has been conceived as a ''character.''</p>
        <p>Olympia Dukakis plays Nora, the delusional mother who is building some sort of structure under her house. Her daughters -- Gail (Wendy Hoopes), Elizabeth (Deborah Hedwall) and Maryann (Catherine Corpeny) -- holler at one another but love their nutty mom. When their dad, Tom (Roy Scheider), shows up at their mother's doorstep, it causes some confusion because Nora has been saying he is dead and doesn't quite recognize him. For whatever reason, he has been gone for 20 years.</p>
        <p>Gail is happy to see him come back. Tom left when she was very young, and she is looking for a father figure. She snuggles up to her uncle, Jack (Edward Herrmann), a priest, for encouragement and advice, but he feigns lack of interest. Elizabeth, a public defender, is full of rage about her father; she remembers how turbulent the house was when Tom and Nora were together. And that's saying something, since there's still plenty of china crashing into the walls.</p>
        <p>''Better Living'' is jam-packed with sarcasm and would-be eccentricity; the perpetually dazed Maryann has yet to name her 8-month-old daughter and has the free-floating neurosis of a character from a 40-year-old stage play. The picture feels like an early rehearsal for a play where all the movement is being coordinated but the underlying emotional notes have yet to be set. Any sense of reality is undermined by the shouting matches, which come across as actressy tantrums.</p>
        <p>Mr. Herrmann comes off best because he doesn't have to shriek his lines. He is the cynical priest who takes a snort or two from his flask whenever things get too weird, a condition that seems to be a constant here. Jack is mournful; a lot of wasted hope seems to be stored in his jowls. But Mr. Herrmann is fleet and smooth; he takes some pride in his performance. Ms. Hoopes has some fine moments. Ms. Hedwall has some powerful scenes; she could be Ms. Dukakis's daughter. It would help if she could take her foot off the gas.</p>
        <p>Nora keeps a snapshot of Tom, and it's a photo of Mr. Scheider from his role in ''Sorcerer,'' William Friedkin's remake of ''The Wages of Fear.'' It was chosen because Tom wears a narrow-brimmed hat similar to the chapeau Mr. Scheider wore in ''Sorcerer.'' One wonders if, after seeing ''Better Living,'' he fondly looks back on the days when he was in a movie about transporting nitroglycerine over the rugged back roads of South America in a truck without shock absorbers. The circumstances must have been much less volatile.</p>
