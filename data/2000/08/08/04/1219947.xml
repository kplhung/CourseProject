        <p>The Ford Motor Company said today that its next generation of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, scheduled to go on sale in January, would be extensively changed from current models so as to reduce the danger to other motorists during collisions and decrease the risk of deadly rollovers.</p>
        <p>The sturdy frame that runs the length of the Explorer, the nation's best-selling sport utility vehicle, will be as low at the front of the vehicle as that of Ford Taurus sedans, considerably reducing the risk that the sport utility vehicles will override cars' bumpers and door sills in crashes, Ford officials said. And the front foot or so of the frame will absorb more energy in a high-speed crash, reducing the risk of injury in both vehicles.</p>

        <p>The Ford Motor Company said today that its next generation of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, scheduled to go on sale in January, would be extensively changed from current models so as to reduce the danger to other motorists during collisions and decrease the risk of deadly rollovers.</p>
        <p>The sturdy frame that runs the length of the Explorer, the nation's best-selling sport utility vehicle, will be as low at the front of the vehicle as that of Ford Taurus sedans, considerably reducing the risk that the sport utility vehicles will override cars' bumpers and door sills in crashes, Ford officials said. And the front foot or so of the frame will absorb more energy in a high-speed crash, reducing the risk of injury in both vehicles.</p>
        <p>''If there is an impact, the vehicles can share the energy of the event, instead of the Explorer imparting it to the passenger vehicle,'' said Stephanie Sweeney, Ford's crash safety supervisor for Explorers.</p>
        <p>Dale E. Claudepierre, Ford's director of midsize sport utility vehicles, said the Explorer's design reflected a shift in the company's approach to safety. ''More so than in the past, we are concerned about the impact our vehicles have on other vehicles,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sweeney said Ford had also improved the safety of Explorer occupants by adding ceiling-mounted side air bags that protect them during rollovers, which are responsible for three-fifths of all deaths in sport utilities. The manufacturer also widened the distance between the front wheels and between the rear wheels by two and a half inches and lowered the entire vehicle slightly to make it more stable and less likely to tip over when it strikes curbs, guard rails and lower-riding vehicles.</p>
        <p>Ford made a point of saying that the changes would not compromise the vehicle's off-road performance. Indeed, thanks to suspension changes, Ford will increase ground clearance by an inch, to 9.2 inches, one of the highest clearances for any sport utility.</p>
        <p>Ford also improved the Explorer's brakes, to stop the vehicle in 135 feet when fully loaded and traveling 60 miles an hour -- similar to a car's stopping distance. The current Explorer needs 164 feet to stop. Sport utilities will not be required to meet brake standards for cars until 2002.</p>
        <p>Independent safety experts said Ford appeared to have made important progress toward improving the safety of motorists who share the road with Explorers, although they cautioned that they would like to study the new vehicles.</p>
        <p>Ford has not lowered the hood of its Explorer, choosing instead to mount lower in the vehicle the long, stiff ''frame rails'' that form the vehicle's skeleton. High hoods increase the risk of head and neck injuries when they strike cars in the side, experts said, although the low frame rails on the Explorer make it less likely that the new model will override cars' door sills and project its hood into cars' passenger compartments during crashes. With a new, optional third row of seats, the Explorer will also be 200 pounds heavier, which could also slightly increase damage to other vehicles in crashes.</p>
        <p>But Gerald Donaldson, senior research director at Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, a nonprofit group in Washington, said he was impressed that Ford was addressing rollovers and risks to other motorists even in the absence of government regulation in either area. ''I am amazed to see it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Ford Explorer has been the nation's best-selling sport utility by a wide margin every year since 1991, although its share of the sport utility market has steadily eroded, to 13.8 percent in the first seven months of this year, as manufacturers have introduced many more models. The Mercury Mountaineer, also redesigned for the new model year, shares a common underbody and other mechanical underpinnings with the Explorer but has different sheet metal, grille, headlights, taillights and interior. It had just 1.4 percent of the market in the first half of this year.</p>
        <p>Under Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive until his retirement at the end of 1998, the company contended that sport utility vehicles inevitably posed risks to other motorists and that nothing could be done about this. In an interview in 1997, Mr. Trotman said a collision between a sport utility vehicle and a car was like smashing two rocks together; the larger rock would be less likely to suffer damage.</p>
        <p>But most of Ford's top management turned over when Mr. Trotman retired, and the company's perspective has changed. Mr. Claudepierre said that by changing the frame rails the company had found a surprisingly simple and inexpensive solution to the problem of sport utility damage to other vehicles.</p>
        <p>Frame rails look like two railroad rails, only they curve up and down somewhat from the front to the back of the vehicle. They are connected by a series of cross bars, and form the vehicle's foundation, providing anchor points for the engine, transmission and suspension.</p>
        <p>The foot-long segments of the frame rails in front of the front cross bar are known as the frame horns. On most models, including current Explorers, the frame horns curve up slightly to just behind the bumper or the grille, a design that makes them prone to overriding cars' bumpers and door sills and spearing passenger compartments and their occupants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Claudepierre said Ford had found it could simply turn over the front segments and have them curve down instead. While this involved some engineering changes in the front end of the vehicle, he said, it is fairly easy to manufacture, because factory robots make roughly the same welds as before but with the front segments inverted.</p>
        <p>''We gave up nothing by flipping them upside down,'' he said. ''That really puts it at the height of a Taurus.''</p>
        <p>Ford installed energy-absorbing, horizontal steel bars last year below the bumpers of its immense Ford Excursion, which has very high frame rails. But Ms. Sweeney said that on the new Explorer, ''We don't need the Excursion blocker beam because we lowered the frame by over two and a half inches -- we didn't just lower the bumper, we lowered the frame.''</p>
        <p>General Motors disclosed last March that it was taking a smaller step in the same direction, using suspension changes to lower the frame rails on its new Chevrolet Blazers, GMC Envoys and Oldsmobile Bravadas by up to two inches as they are introduced this autumn.</p>
        <p>Ford also made the front ends of the new Explorer's frame rails less stiff, by drilling holes in them so that the rails will crumple slightly during high-speed crashes, absorbing some of the force of an impact. Such changes are possible partly because the new Explorer will no longer share a common frame with the Ranger pickup truck.</p>
        <p>In addition to the frame horns, the rest of the Explorer' frame rails are slightly lower than before, partly because of suspension changes that will also make the ride less bouncy and more carlike. Ford took the unusual step of mounting the rear suspension through holes in the frame rails. As a result, the new Explorer accommodates the optional third row of seats that is mounted low enough to allow ample headroom even for adults up to 6 feet 6 inches tall. The extra seats could lure families out of larger, far less fuel-efficient sport utilities.</p>
        <p>Ford has also introduced two more fuel-efficient engines, so that even with the additional weight of the optional row of seats the vehicle will get an extra mile per gallon on the highway.</p>
