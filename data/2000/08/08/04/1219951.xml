        <p>In the further adventures of the league that cried ''smash mouth!'' the XFL yesterday unveiled its official football. The red, silver and black ball will arrive in stores before games are first played next February.</p>
        <p>The ball is an attitudinal symbol of the tart and sassy league, a progeny of NBC and the attitude-engorged World Wrestling Federation.</p>
        <p>''The ball needed a point of view,'' said Eddie Bender, of Spalding, the XFL's first licensee.</p>
        <p>The XFL's New York/New Jersey franchise, one of eight in the league, also introduced its general manager, Drew Pearson, the former Dallas Cowboys receiver, who caught the first touchdown pass at Giants Stadium, the XFL's local ballpark.</p>
        <p>He is a successful owner of a headwear company but has no experience in player personnel, which may hurt him when he must choose his 38 players from a pool of about 1,000 being assembled, recruited, prodded and poked by XFL talent evaluators.</p>
        <p>''When I retired, I dreamed I'd be a general manager, but that wasn't afforded me,'' Pearson said.</p>
        <p>Mike Keller, the XFL's chief of football operations, said Pearson had been wrongly ignored. ''I'd stand Drew up against half the general managers in the N.F.L.,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Pearson's franchise -- which, like all the XFL teams, is still unnamed -- also has a lease to play five games a year at Giants Stadium, now a grass palace, a prerequisite for the XFL, which prides itself on its plan to return football to a snarling past without AstroToupees.</p>
        <p>''We have a long history of great events with Vince McMahon,'' said James DiEleuterio Jr., chairman of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, referring to the W.W.F. chairman and to happy smackdowns at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>DiEleuterio said he is unworried that the W.W.F.'s scripted misogyny and antisocial behavior will encroach upon the periphery of the XFL's avowed legitimate games. ''We're very familiar with how the W.W.F. operates,'' DiEleuterio said.</p>
        <p>Without lifting a finger, the Jets and the Giants will split all the XFL team's concession revenues and 50 percent of the net parking revenues.</p>
        <p>As the XFL's pre-opening business marches on, it insists that its credibility will increase and skeptics will discover its football to be an honest, more aggressive version of the N.F.L.'s, with such tweaks as: one foot inbounds for receptions, and no place-kicked extra points, fair catches or knees in the end zone for touchbacks. And, if you can believe it, no wrestler chorus lines.</p>
        <p>If the XFL were not serious about being taken semiseriously, would it hire Dick Butkus, from the N.F.L.'s manlier past, to coach the Chicago team?</p>
        <p>Even with no coaching experience, seeing the former Bear stalk Soldier Field should ease fears that Mankind would be calling the plays while wearing George Halas's pilfered fedora. Shouldn't it?</p>
        <p>Frazier's Side of the Story</p>
        <p>''It tells the truth,'' Marvis Frazier was saying Wednesday. ''It heals.''</p>
        <p>Frazier had just watched a screening of ''Ali-Frazier I: One Nation . . . Divisible,'' a revealing HBO documentary about the March 8, 1971, fight, the first between his father, Joe, then the heavyweight boxing champion, and Muhammad Ali.</p>
        <p>But the memory of his father's victory has always been tainted by Ali's taunting of his opponent as ''ugly'' and an ''Uncle Tom.''</p>
        <p>''Our family is now only just healing,'' Marvis Frazier said.</p>
        <p>The film should help, by detailing how Frazier helped Ali get a license to fight after his exile for refusing induction into the Army and gave Ali money when he was deprived of his livelihood.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the world knew how close we were,'' Joe Frazier said, also after the screening, ''or how I helped him.'' Once their bout was set, Ali turned on him, labeling Frazier the ''white man's champion.''</p>
        <p>Frazier's only retort was to insist on calling Ali ''Clay.''</p>
        <p>''Now the people will know what the deal was,'' Frazier said. ''We were friends until he got his license.'' In the documentary, Frazier said that ''if I have done anything wrong to him -- hey, man -- forgive me.''</p>
        <p>Frazier, overshadowed by Ali during their careers, tells his story of the bout; Ali, who has Parkinson's syndrome, was not interviewed.</p>
        <p>''To everything there is a season,'' Marvis Frazier said, ''and this is the season for my father to be heard.''</p>
        <p>Millen's New Career</p>
        <p>Matt Millen, the former linebacker and current Fox N.F.L. analyst, is in postgraduate school, learning to be an umpire. He has officiated at scrimmages at four training camps, and will play an umpire, with a tiny camera and microphone, at Fox's Aug. 20 New England-Tampa Bay preseason game.</p>
        <p>''The movement is easy, and seeing the big picture is easy, but what's difficult to remember are the mechanics of the position,'' he said. ''Like when we started, I kept forgetting to bring the ball in.''</p>
        <p>Nor has it been easy to coordinate seeing a penalty with throwing a flag.</p>
        <p>''The first time, I was watching the play, and I saw a guy holding right in front of me,'' he said. ''In my mind, I said, 'No question that's a hold,' and I didn't do anything. Ronnie Botchan, my mentor, said, 'Did you see that penalty?' I said, 'Yeah,' and he said, 'Then why didn't you throw the flag?' ''</p>
        <p>At San Francisco's camp, Fox's John Madden warned Millen that Coach Steve Mariucci would set him up.</p>
        <p>''So they ran a shallow cross underneath to pick off the umpire,'' Millen said. ''I moved up, saw Terrell Owens coming. I tried to duck under him, but he nailed me. Being compassionate, Mariucci said, 'Terrell, are you all right?' And John sat there, doubled over howling.''</p>
