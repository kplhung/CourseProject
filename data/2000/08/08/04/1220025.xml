        <p>Joshua L Hirschel letter replies to Charles W Kadlec's Aug 1 Op-Ed article on taxes, saying move toward a more regressive tax system would mean lower quality of life for the poor and middle class; says nation must invest in its collective future; cartoon</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''How Taxes Trickle Down'' (Op-Ed, Aug. 1), Charles W. Kadlec is right to assert that high-income individuals do not bear the entire burden of an increase in the top marginal tax rates. But what remains unsaid is one of the most obvious costs associated with moving toward a regressive tax system: significantly higher taxes for the poor and the middle class that would result in a lower quality of life.</p>

        <p>Our greatest concern should be taking advantage of our economic health by investing wisely in our collective future -- in education and health care or by paying down our debt -- instead of jeopardizing our shared success for the whims of a select few.</p>
