      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Prosecutors here have dropped charges against two men accused in separate rapes  inside the Newark Public Library in 1998, after DNA testing found that a third, unknown man had committed both crimes.</p>
        <p>The DNA tests, completed last month, exonerated Edwin Diaz, 25, of Parsippany and Jason Yantin, 20, of Newark, who had been identified by the victims from photographs.</p>
        <p>The arrests of the men two years ago led top Newark police officials to label them sexual predators, and  prompted Mayor Sharpe James to criticize security at the city's spacious, multichambered main library branch.</p>
        <p>The tests were delayed, in part  because Mr. Yantin's lawyer challenged their legal basis. But Mr. Diaz volunteered to undergo the DNA testing.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, he cringed at the memory of being labeled a predator, but was stoical in reviewing the disruption in his life as the rape charges hovered over him for the last two years. Sometimes, he said, ''bad things happen'' to people.</p>
        <p>''Now I just want to be normal,'' he said, pausing to add pensively, ''In the last two years I just haven't felt normal.''</p>
        <p>The two cases highlighted the increasing use of biological evidence in testing for unique DNA characteristics before trials. More commonly, such tests have been used to challenge old convictions or reopen long-closed cases.</p>
        <p>Robert Laurino, the head of the Essex County prosecutor's sex crime unit, said that as the tests became cheaper to perform they were becoming more routine, even though a backlog at the state police laboratory often delays results for months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Laurino said he had sought the DNA testing in the two library rape cases because they were so close in time -- May 12 and June 17 -- and similar in manner that it seemed likely that they were committed by one person.</p>
        <p>DNA testing is likely to be used even more, he said, because the state will go online later this month with its first database of DNA samples taken from convicted sex offenders, a catalog of some 4,000 samples that was authorized in 1994 by legislation known as Megan's Law.</p>
        <p>In addition, the State Legislature  approved measures in its last session requiring the taking and cataloging of blood and DNA samples from state prisoners convicted of everything from murder to endangering the welfare of a minor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Laurino said that he would resume investigating the two rape cases, first by comparing the DNA from the two crime scenes with the samples in the soon-to-be-ready database of sex offenders.</p>
        <p>Joseph Rotella, Mr. Diaz's lawyer, praised the prosecutor's office for its willingness to conduct the DNA comparisons. Mr. Yantin's public defenders, however, had fought the testing, delaying it for about six months before a judge ordered the tests.</p>
        <p>The public defender could not be reached for comment; Mr. Yantin has an unlisted telephone number.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rotella suggested that the different approaches highlighted the double-edged sword of DNA testing.</p>
        <p>''It is a very valuable tool for a defense attorney in that it can exonerate your client completely when he is innocent,'' he said. ''But it is a tremendous weapon for the prosecutor in that it can convict your client in the absence of any other evidence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Diaz said the picture that was used to identify him was one in a book of sexual offenders and was the result of a 1995 incident in which a former girlfriend charged him with criminal restraint and criminal sexual contact. He entered no plea in that case; he was accepted into a pretrial diversion program, which he  successfully completed. He could have had his record expunged, but he did not make the request.</p>
        <p>Today he said he regretted not having done that. He had put the 1995 incident behind him, he said, and was a law-abiding citizen. Mr. Rotella said that he would move to expunge the record and that he believed his client had grounds for a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>In the years in which he lived under the threat of the charges, Mr. Diaz said, he had withdrawn some. A former salesman with a Coca-Cola distributor, he had, with his employer's support and understanding, given up the high visibility of a sales route for a simple truck driving job.  He said he needed time to himself and had relied on the support of family, friends and co-workers to get through it all.</p>
