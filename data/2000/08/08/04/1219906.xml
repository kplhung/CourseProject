        <p>AMERICA'S best-selling sport utility, the Ford Explorer, is getting its first total redesign since it arrived on the market in 1990.</p>
        <p>Changes on the 2002 Explorer, which goes on sale early next year, have resulted in more room, an improved ride and more comfort and safety features.</p>
        <p>Styling changes are subtle: The headlamps and taillamps are larger and the body's lines are more defined. But its sibling S.U.V., the Mercury Mountaineer, looks significantly different from the current model and from the Explorer. It has sharper lines and brushed metal trim on the lights and grille.</p>

        <p>AMERICA'S best-selling sport utility, the Ford Explorer, is getting its first total redesign since it arrived on the market in 1990.</p>
        <p>Changes on the 2002 Explorer, which goes on sale early next year, have resulted in more room, an improved ride and more comfort and safety features.</p>
        <p>Styling changes are subtle: The headlamps and taillamps are larger and the body's lines are more defined. But its sibling S.U.V., the Mercury Mountaineer, looks significantly different from the current model and from the Explorer. It has sharper lines and brushed metal trim on the lights and grille.</p>
        <p>The revamped Explorer and Mountaineer no longer use the architecture of the Ford Ranger pickup. Instead, they share a new, stiffer chassis that uses suspension components, including an independent rear suspension, that are similar to those of cars. The changes should result in a smoother ride, and they allowed Ford engineers to lower the floor while increasing ground clearance, thus creating more interior space.</p>
        <p>With the additional space; lower, flat floor; and a new third-row seat, these are now seven-passenger vehicles.</p>
        <p>Ford has eliminated the old-fashioned pushrod engine offered in the 2000 Explorer. The base engine is an improved 4-liter overhead-cam V-6 rated at 210 horsepower; also available is a 4.6-liter, 240-horsepower V-8. Maximum towing capacity will rise to 7,400 pounds.</p>
        <p>Available equipment will include pedals that drivers can adjust to suit their stature, and an air-bag curtain that offers protection in side impacts. Later in 2001, sensors will be added that detect when the vehicle is about to roll over, deploy the air-bag curtain and fasten it down to keep occupants from being ejected.</p>
