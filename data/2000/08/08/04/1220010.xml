        <p>Growing up in Maine, Mike Bordick obeyed a simple rule for when to play baseball.</p>
        <p>''If there was a day that you could put a jacket on and it wasn't snowing, we'd be outside playing baseball,'' said Bordick, the Mets' new shortstop. ''For high school practices and stuff like that, if the wind was blowing and the snow was moving around a little bit, we'd be on a hardwood gym floor getting ground balls. But any time you could get outside, we'd be outside.''</p>

        <p>Growing up in Maine, Mike Bordick obeyed a simple rule for when to play baseball.</p>
        <p>''If there was a day that you could put a jacket on and it wasn't snowing, we'd be outside playing baseball,'' said Bordick, the Mets' new shortstop. ''For high school practices and stuff like that, if the wind was blowing and the snow was moving around a little bit, we'd be on a hardwood gym floor getting ground balls. But any time you could get outside, we'd be outside.''</p>
        <p>Bordick's father, Michael, was in the Air Force, and he moved frequently. Mike Bordick was born in Michigan and spent parts of his early childhood in Maine and in upstate New York before the family settled in Winterport, Me., while he was in high school. He remembers the thud of a hardball bouncing across a basketball court, the way it skipped unnaturally to him.</p>
        <p>Bordick's favorite sport was football, but he was scrawny and never grew to be very big. Baseball suited him better.</p>
        <p>Only one player born in Maine, Matt Kinney, a Minnesota Twins minor leaguer, was on a 40-man major league roster this spring. Bordick and the former pitchers Bill Swift and Jim Beattie are probably the most prominent Maine natives to make it big in the sport.</p>
        <p>Bordick has never been bigger than he is now, at 35, with his hair graying and a decade of major league experience. In July he earned his first All-Star Game selection. Since the Mets acquired him from Baltimore in a trade last Friday, Bordick has six hits in 19 at-bats and has played flawless defense. He is hitting .298 over all as the Mets enter a three-game series with the Diamondbacks in Phoenix tonight. Bordick is part of a lineup whose catcher, Mike Piazza, was not chosen until the 62nd round of the amateur draft. Bordick was not chosen at all.</p>
        <p>Bordick's high school, Hampden Academy, played only 12 baseball games a year. He did not attract any professional scouts, and laughed when asked if he had. ''You don't get that much exposure in Maine,'' Bordick said. ''Plus, I wasn't even close to being ready.''</p>
        <p>But he showed an uncommon quickness in the field to John Winkin, the coach at the University of Maine. Winkin offered Bordick a partial scholarship, installed him at shortstop and marveled at his professional disposition. Bordick was fun-loving and loose, Winkin said, but on the field he was serious. He worked hard, and never let an error or a bad at-bat affect his performance.</p>
        <p>When winter practice began, the campus was usually covered with snow. For Bordick, the indoor facilities were better than they had been in high school -- Maine's field house had a synthetic turf floor, two batting cages and a net around a makeshift infield -- and there was little infielders could do outside. The outfielders could take fly balls on a plowed parking lot, but when the snow covered the fields, Bordick was shut in.</p>
        <p>His first home game at Maine was played in a snowstorm, against Vermont in 1984, Bordick said, and he made four errors. ''I couldn't tell if it was a snowball or a baseball coming at me,'' he said. ''Crazy.''</p>
        <p>When the weather cleared, his skill in the field became obvious. ''Of all the kids I've ever coached, I've never had one who could react as quickly to the crack of the bat,'' Winkin said. ''He had amazing alertness and instincts, and that's made him the fielder he is today. Some guys may have greater arm strength, but Mike gets to the ball quickly and he's always had an accurate arm.''</p>
        <p>Bordick developed as a hitter, raising his average from .201 as a freshman to .364 as a junior, when the Black Bears made it to the College World Series. Seven players from that team were among the 982 players drafted in June 1986, but Bordick was not picked. The only scout who talked to him, he said, was J. P. Ricciardi of the Oakland Athletics.</p>
        <p>Ricciardi was in his first year as a scout, and he could not recommend the A's draft a player who might not sign. He spoke with Bordick, but was not sure he would leave school early to sign. Bordick, though, was disappointed when the draft was over.</p>
        <p>''I was just resigned to the fact that it wasn't going to happen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mostly for fun, Bordick decided to play in the summer Cape Cod League for college stars. Another college shortstop Oakland had drafted, Ken Bowen, was also playing there, and the A's scouting director came to see him. But negotiations stalled, and Ricciardi received permission to make an offer to the sure-handed, contact-hitting shortstop from Maine.</p>
        <p>''There's no one else that's here,'' Ricciardi said he told Bordick. ''If they liked you, they would be here. You didn't get drafted this year, and you've accomplished everything you can as a college player. Here's an opportunity to go to an organization that likes you, and here's $15,000.''</p>
        <p>Bordick accepted, though Ricciardi did not project him as more than a utility player in the majors. He worked his way steadily through the Oakland farm system, then joined the major league team briefly in 1990. Bordick was in the instructional league that October when he was summoned back; Walt Weiss had gotten hurt in the playoffs and Bordick was needed on the World Series roster.</p>
        <p>He made the playoffs once more in Oakland, and again in 1997 with the Orioles in Baltimore, where he signed as a free agent and bought a home.</p>
        <p>Before joining the Orioles, Bordick and his family spent their winters in Maine, and he worked out on his own. Since moving to Maryland, he has worked out with teammates, whose programs helped him add muscle. Bordick, 5 feet 11 inches and 175 pounds, hit five homers in three years in college, but has a career-high 17 home runs this season.</p>
        <p>His defense and his approach to the game stand out most. Since the Mets traded for him, baseball executives have told Mets General Manager Steve Phillips what a solid professional he acquired. It is common for people who have been around Bordick to call him one of their favorites.</p>
        <p>''He's a throwback, a regular guy who appreciates the game for what it is,'' Ricciardi said. ''One thing about New England people, and it's kind of corny, but there's a work ethic to people who are from here and play up here. Every day he puts on a uniform, he realizes he's fortunate to be playing. He doesn't take it for granted.''</p>
        <p>Winkin said he was always impressed by how much fun Bordick had in everything he did. Inside or outside, drills or games, Bordick loved it. He is the same way today.</p>
        <p>''I'm a firm believer in preparation, which means you work it,'' Bordick said. ''I take my job seriously. For me, that's the fun part. Some people, when they hear 'work,' tend to shy away from it. But I love going down to the batting cage and working on my swing. I love taking ground balls.</p>
        <p>''The most important thing is doing stuff the right way.''</p>
