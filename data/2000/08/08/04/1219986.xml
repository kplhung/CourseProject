        <p>After their lives were changed by a 14-year-old slayer, the parents of the three girls he killed in a school shooting here sued more than 50 people who they said shared responsibility for the deaths.</p>
        <p>They sued the killer and his parents, teachers, school officials, other teenagers, neighbors and the makers of violent video games, Web sites and movies.</p>
        <p>But by this week, after two judges had dismissed virtually all the claims, just one defendant remained: the killer himself, Michael Carneal, who is serving a life sentence after pleading guilty but mentally ill to murder. He is the only one the courts had said could be held liable for the deaths.</p>
        <p>Today, saying they would appeal all the rulings against them, the families of the three girls accepted a settlement of their claims against Mr. Carneal in which he acknowledged liability for the deaths and set damages at $42 million, an amount the families are never likely to collect.</p>
        <p>''It's symbolic,'' said Gwen Hadley, whose daughter Nichole was one of those killed. ''He is finally having to take some responsibility for what he did.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Carneal has no assets and his family's insurance company is already fighting claims, saying it is not responsible for criminal acts.</p>
        <p>The settlement was a punctuation mark in a long legal battle that has already produced one of the country's most extensive public records on a school shooting.</p>
        <p>The story of the legal battle shows how difficult it is to assign blame to the many people who, in retrospect, might have been able to prevent rampage killings, and it shows how hard it is to unravel what really happened in cases that are, by definition, unfathomable.</p>
        <p>In pretrial testimony and in hundreds of documents, the lawyer for the families of the three girls has put together a catalog of the mistakes, the missed warning signs and the provocations that often contribute to rampage killings. The families say their legal setbacks show that the courts are turning their backs on the schoolhouse tragedies.</p>
        <p>''They just want to be like an ostrich and pretend it will all go away,'' said Sabrina Steger, whose daughter Kayce was killed when Mr. Carneal fired into a prayer group at Heath High School on Dec. 1, 1997.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Carneal is the only one who killed the girls and injured five other students, said Judge William L. Shadoan of McCracken County Circuit Court, who has been handling the  case in which the settlement was reached.</p>
        <p>''This kid stole all the guns himself,'' Judge Shadoan said in an interview. ''He took them to school and he took the gun out of his backpack and he started shooting.''</p>
        <p>Whatever else happened, the judge said, no one else did that.</p>
        <p>Senior Judge Edward H. Johnstone of Federal District Court in Paducah reached a similar conclusion in April in dismissing a separate case the families had filed against what they contended was the influence of the violent media.</p>
        <p>''Reasonable people,'' Judge Johnstone wrote, ''would not conclude that it was foreseeable to defendants that Michael Carneal, a boy who played their games, watched their movies and viewed their Web site materials would murder his classmates.''</p>
        <p>Still, evidence gathered by the parents' lawyer shows that none of the many people who could have taken  action to stop Mr. Carneal or get him help did so. He was a boy, the court files show, who kept knives under his mattress, flashed guns at school and wrote homicidal and suicidal fantasies in school papers.</p>
        <p>Before the crime, the testimony of other teenagers shows that Mr. Carneal warned many people that ''something big'' was going to happen. But no matter what sinister possibilities others suspected, legal experts say, bedrock principles generally hold people responsible only when they play a role in placing someone in danger.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs' lawyer argued that the law was moving toward encouraging people to try to prevent mass tragedies. But, however the current cases end, they have already cast unusual light on the evolution of a school shooting.</p>
        <p>The Teenagers</p>
        <p>It was not hard for the plaintiffs' lawyer, Mike Breen, to prove that many of the teenagers at Heath High had been warned. Some said they had expected water balloons. Some said Michael had told them that Monday would be a ''day of reckoning.'' The court file contains a letter from one teenage girl to another that says, ''I knew Michael was bringing a gun and that he was going to shoot at the prayer circle Monday morning.''</p>
        <p>The teenagers' lawyers argued they had expected a prank. Judge Shadoan agreed.</p>
        <p>''There may have been a moral duty or Christian duty to do something,'' the judge said in court, ''but there was no legal duty.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the families' strongest claims were against a smaller group of teenagers the plaintiffs' lawyer called co-conspirators. None were  charged with a crime, but the sheriff here said publicly that he suspected that some had helped plan the shooting and then lost their nerve.</p>
        <p>But what had seemed to be evidence of collaboration had become muddied by the time of the testimony. Events that had seemed sinister were explained away.</p>
        <p>A police report showed that one boy said, ''Let me in on it,'' when Michael had warned a table full of teenagers. In a deposition this winter the young man was asked if he had said that. ''Jokingly,'' was the answer that was difficult to disprove.</p>
        <p>A larger problem for the plaintiffs was that the conspiracy theory was based in part on what Michael Carneal himself had said and later recanted. Shortly after the killings, Michael told an investigator he had planned the violence with other teenagers.</p>
        <p>''Carneal said that the plan was that he would start shooting, causing a distraction,'' a police report said, ''so that the other boys could pick up their guns and go to their points.''</p>
        <p>That morning, Michael took to school four long guns wrapped in a blanket in addition to the handgun in his backpack that he would use in the shooting.</p>
        <p>By February, when Mr. Carneal testified in a deposition, he was no longer the scrawny 5 foot 2 he was at the time of the crime. Now, he was 17, 6 foot 1 and 243 pounds, nearly an adult, who had had time to think about consequences.</p>
        <p>He gave the plaintiffs no help. No one else had been involved, he said. He said he had invented the conspiracy story to tell the police ''what they wanted to hear.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers following the case say appeals courts could well reverse  Judge Shadoan on the dismissals of the suit against these teenagers and hold that a jury should decide if there was enough evidence that others participated in the shooting.</p>
        <p>In the interview, the judge said he had not seen evidence that any of the teenagers other than Mr. Carneal  believed there was a plan. When the shooting started, he said, ''These kids ran, just like all the other kids.''</p>
        <p>The Parents</p>
        <p>Two days after the killings, John T. Carneal, a prominent Paducah lawyer, went to see the principal of the school where his son had committed murder.</p>
        <p>''I am the head of the house, I am responsible,'' the elder Carneal said, crying, the principal testified.</p>
        <p>The parents of the murdered girls came to agree. Michael was a ''ticking time bomb,'' Mrs. Hadley said.</p>
        <p>After the killings, Michael told psychiatrists that he had sometimes sobbed for no reason before the crime and was so fearful at home that he obsessively covered the vents in the bathroom to keep bad people from getting him and that he had sometimes walked from one piece of furniture to another at home so he would not risk having some imagined person cut off his feet.</p>
        <p>He once stabbed himself with a sewing needle, leaving a bruise the size of a silver dollar but told his parents he had been in a bike accident. He testified that he was suicidal, ''mad at the world,'' and hated being compared with his older sister, a model student. The year before the killings, his mother knew, he had been humiliated when a gossip column in the school newspaper speculated that he and another boy had feelings for each other.</p>
        <p>But his father testified, ''I saw no evidence that Mike had any problems.''</p>
        <p>The Carneals' lawyer, Michael D. Moore, said, ''Michael never did anything in front of them to indicate he had even the potential for violence.''</p>
        <p>The Teachers</p>
        <p>The picture of Michael at school is a chilling portrait of a boy unraveling. In one school paper he said other children ''mocked and slaughtered my self-esteem.'' In another he described a fantasy of mutilating ''preps'' and described a boy opening fire on a group of schoolmates. ''There was blood everywhere,'' it said.</p>
        <p>Michael's father testified that no one at the school had mentioned those troubling papers. The teachers were unaware that the boy had taken a gun to school and that he had courted attention by giving away stolen property and talking about taking over the school or a mall.</p>
        <p>But in Kentucky, as in many other  states, school officials are generally protected from suits by rules of sovereign immunity that shield government agencies.</p>
        <p>When he dismissed the cases against the teachers and school officials last year, Judge Shadoan cited those rules.</p>
        <p>''We cannot expect those teachers and administrators to be psychiatrists, lawyers, psychologists, or physicians,'' he wrote. ''They are to educate our children. Nothing more and nothing less.''</p>
        <p>Planning Appeals</p>
        <p>As the lawsuits have ground on, fury over them has grown here. Some people say the three families  have blamed too many people who had done nothing wrong. Nancy C. Holm, the mother of a boy who was injured in the shooting, wrote a letter to the editor of The Paducah Sun last year that drew widespread comment here. It suggested that the three families had been influenced by their lawyer in a search for dollars.</p>
        <p>''Things are getting out of hand,'' Mrs. Holm wrote.</p>
        <p>In recent interviews, all three sets of parents said they were too troubled by what they had learned about the missed chances to avoid the killings to drop their suits.</p>
        <p>''No amount of money could bring back our kids,'' said Judy James, whose daughter Jessica was killed, ''and we would rather have our kids back than any amount of money. All we're asking for is for people to be accountable and responsible for what happened.''</p>
