        <p>George W. Bush had an on-screen audition for the role of president last night, commandeering a chunk of prime time, as presidents do, to deliver an extended speech. In the surprise-free zone of this convention, the only question was how convincing a performance would he give.</p>
        <p>That is not a frivolous issue in a television-driven campaign, when a candidate's ability to act like a president on camera may go further than any number of issue-oriented appearances on ''Meet the Press'' (and reach a far larger audience). In those terms, Mr. Bush resembled an actor who had studied hard, learned his lines and was determined to give the best reading he could under circumstances that did not play to his strengths.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has always been and still is better in situations of casual intimacy, chatting with a friendly interviewer like Larry King. Last night, his brow was perpetually furrowed and he seemed to squint into the camera (blinding lights or an effort to read the Teleprompter seemed like plausible reasons), which made him look as if he were trying exceptionally hard to be taken seriously.</p>
        <p>Proving that he was substantial enough to be president was, of course, what all the commentators said he had to do. As Bob Schieffer said on CBS in the minutes leading up to the speech: ''The main message is: he's ready.'' And, as Peter Jennings said on ABC, ''It's a cliche for a reason: the most important speech of his life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was stiffest in his delivery when reciting lines that were all too conspicuously written to become sound bites, especially in the refrain, repeated three times: ''This administration had its chance. They have not led; we will.'' He seemed far more comfortable and convincing when he spoke emotionally, notably when acknowledging his parents.</p>
        <p>At that moment the emotion translated through the television screen; it didn't hurt that the camera went to the obviously moved George and Barbara Bush, beaming with the most universal sort of parental pride, sitting there as icons to nudge the emotion along.</p>
        <p>Anyone would have needed that visual aid, because speeches rarely make good television. That can be overcome if a candidate's delivery is dynamic enough to leap off the screen. Mr. Bush's wasn't. But at times he showed the flicker of a connection with the camera that suggested he was just beginning to master this part of the game.</p>
        <p>The networks and cable channels led up to the speech in different, and telling, ways. NBC and its cable channel, MSNBC, along with CNN and the Fox News Channel, ran the treacly video biography of Mr. Bush made for the Republican National Committee. In this gushy film, his Mom and Dad say he's great. He is seen as governor surrounded by schoolchildren.</p>
        <p>The film has the tone and picture-perfect quality of a storybook. ''Family, freedom, such a powerful part of the American spirit,'' Mr. Bush says in this hagiography of himself.</p>
        <p>But ABC and CBS created a far more intelligent context, presenting their own more balanced biographical features while the RNC's video was running elsewhere. These reports gave Mr. Bush full credit for his quick rise to political success, but also raised the tougher questions about him. As the CBS report put it, ''Is George W. Bush prepared to lead the most powerful nation on earth?'' While the Republican National Committee video had him extolling the virtues of freedom, the CBS and ABC reports included tape of the pop quiz in which he was unable to name world leaders.</p>
        <p>After all the carping about how this convention is nothing more than an infomercial, a little reporting was the least a network could do. The networks that simply labeled the video as a Republican National Committee production and let it run (there was no time to point out all its airbrushed details) seemed to be throwing up their hands in defeat, resigned to being led by the nose through the final night of the Republican-scripted show.</p>
