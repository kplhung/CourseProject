        <p>In high summer, when pleasure is at the prow, people who love looking at pictures often remember the art museum at Smith College in Northampton, Mass. Not only is the collection quite remarkable in itself, but it represents a collective effort over many generations by the faculty of the college, by the successive directors of the museum and by discerning, devoted and strong-minded alumnae.</p>
        <p>These three elements make a formidable combination. Anyone who studies the catalog of the collection will find that it is very difficult to guess at what age the donor in question came forward with this or that gift. The museum has never hewn to any specific line in the development of art. As the 21st century dawns, it is as alert to the multicultural input of Betye Saar and Jaune Quick-to-See-Smith as its founders were to the granitic severity that John Singleton Copley, in the 1770's, could give to the features of the Honorable John Erving, who had arrived in America as nobody and ended as one of the most powerful men in Boston.</p>

        <p>In high summer, when pleasure is at the prow, people who love looking at pictures often remember the art museum at Smith College in Northampton, Mass. Not only is the collection quite remarkable in itself, but it represents a collective effort over many generations by the faculty of the college, by the successive directors of the museum and by discerning, devoted and strong-minded alumnae.</p>
        <p>These three elements make a formidable combination. Anyone who studies the catalog of the collection will find that it is very difficult to guess at what age the donor in question came forward with this or that gift. The museum has never hewn to any specific line in the development of art. As the 21st century dawns, it is as alert to the multicultural input of Betye Saar and Jaune Quick-to-See-Smith as its founders were to the granitic severity that John Singleton Copley, in the 1770's, could give to the features of the Honorable John Erving, who had arrived in America as nobody and ended as one of the most powerful men in Boston.</p>
        <p>It is unfortunate, then, that the museum will be closed ''for renovation and expansion'' until 2002. The good news for New Yorkers, however, is that 74 of its paintings and sculptures are now on loan to the National Academy of Design museum.</p>
        <p>The Smith College Museum of Art cuts a swath of some 250 years in American art, and here and there in the show at the National Academy there is something particularly enticing. One such work is Edward Hopper's ''Pretty Penny,'' painted in 1939. It was given to the museum in 1964 by the actress Helen Hayes, who received an honorary doctorate from Smith in 1940.</p>
        <p>As is well known, Hopper was not one to seek out the brighter side of American life. Nor did he want to be commissioned to do portraits, whether of people or of houses. He saw it as a moral duty to dwell on the darker side of American architecture, and he was rather put out to be offered $2,500 to paint Helen Hayes's house. This was tradesman's work, and he had had enough of that in his earlier days.</p>
        <p>The Hayes house, in Nyack, N.Y., was joyous, carefree, light-inviting and altogether out of sync with Hopper. He agreed to go see it. But he and Hayes did not exactly hit it off. After his visit, she said: ''I had never met a more misanthropic, grumpy, grouchy individual in my life. He was like a big hellcat of anger and resentment at the whole thing.''</p>
        <p>But these problems were resolved when Hopper finally produced, after careful preliminary drawings, a painting that is direct, straightforward and almost ecstatic in its rendering of the Hayes house. It looks, in fact, like a real estate agent's dream. The famed loneliness and alienation that so often permeated Hopper's paintings of houses were banished, and all parties seem to have been pleased with the result.</p>
        <p>One of the more inventive directors of the Smith College museum was Henry-Russell Hitchcock. Though best known as an architectural historian, Hitchcock was fascinated by paintings that happened to tickle his fancy.</p>
        <p>One of these was Florine Stett heimer's portrait of Henry McBride, an art critic who wrote for some of the best American journals of the 1920's. The portrait is an anthology, and almost an alphabet, of McBride's looks, tastes and activities. When read closely, it reveals itself as a true document of its times. It also tells us why Marcel Duchamp organized a memorial retrospective for Stettheimer at the Museum of Modern Art in 1946.</p>
        <p>Exemplary as some of the museum directors have been, there is something particularly loving and persistent about the patience with which the alumnae of Smith College have helped to keep the collection apart from its contemporaries in other places.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, too, a major artist has stepped in, as Frank Stella did when he gave his ''Damascus Gate (Variation III)'' of 1969 to the college. Ten feet high and 40 feet wide, it fulfills the wishes and hopes of Smith's first president, L. Clark Seelye, who said in July 1875 that he wanted every Smith student to have direct access to ''the famous masterpieces.''</p>
        <p>When Seelye himself began to buy for the museum, he went straight to what we now see as the top, with paintings by Thomas Eakins (bought in 1879 for $100) and Albert Pinkham Ryder (bought, probably, from Ryder himself).</p>
        <p>Not only has the college's art museum had some remarkable directors over the last 125 years, but the level of gifts from grateful alumnae has been consistently high as well. The collection amounts, in fact, to a concise history of American art since 1880 that has been built up generation by generation.</p>
        <p>Here and there, a terrible poignancy strikes us among the Smith College paintings on display at the National Academy. One of the most haunting images in American painting is the ''Mourning Picture'' by Edwin Romanzo Elmer (1850-1923). It is a family portrait, with father, mother, a daughter who had died not long before and a pet sheep against the backdrop of a house of which the artist was clearly rather proud. When it was first shown in a post office in 1890, the local paper said that ''Mr. Elmer is quite an artist.''</p>
        <p>But it was not seen again until 1950, when the artist's niece showed it to Hitchcock, who saw at once that it was an astonishing achievement by an artist who had died unknown. From the moment that Smith College acquired the painting, it made its way into one magazine after another. Wherever it was shown, and not least in Europe -- Frankfurt, Rotterdam, Munich, Brussels -- its elegiac power was interpreted as expressly American. Familiar as it may now be in reproduction, it has kept its secrets, and the delicacy of its feelings, intact.</p>
        <p>The general tone of the show is, however, anything but elegiac. There is Charles Sheeler's famous ''Rolling Power'' (1939), the most glorious compliment ever paid in art to the steam locomotive at the height of its power and importance.</p>
        <p>There is also Winslow Homer's ''Shipyard at Gloucester'' (1871), which shows a fishing schooner on the stocks in its every least and last detail. Nothing escaped Homer's eye in such matters, and we can sense the prodigious speeds that these schooners could achieve. It is in paintings like these that American art could ''accentuate the positive'' and make us feel that in such a country anything was possible.</p>
        <p>''American Spectrum: Paintings and Sculpture From the Smith College Museum of Art'' remains at the National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, between 89th and 90th Streets, (212) 369-4880, through Sept. 10.</p>
