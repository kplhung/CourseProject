        <p>Through Sept. 9</p>
        <p>Certain young artists are always aspiring to the equivalent of rock star status. The members of the music collective called Sonic Youth -- Kim Gordon, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, and Steve Shelley -- are the real thing.</p>
        <p>During the postpunk years of the early 1980's, they formed an artists' band that was integral to the downtown club scene centered on and around the East Village. In addition to producing records, they turned out songs and poetry (many by Ms. Gordon), art and promotional graphics (often the same thing),  and books and self-published magazines, including Mr. Moore's remarkable Sonic Death and Killer.</p>
        <p>They also interacted with other media-straddling artists. And the big, dynamite gathering of Sonic Youth material, organized by Todd Alden at Printed Matter, includes an entire wall of album covers with designs by, among others, Barbara Ess, Dan Graham, Mike Kelley, Raymond Pettibon, Gerhard Richter and Jeff Wall.</p>
        <p>The band is alive and well. It released a new album, ''NYC Ghosts and Flowers,'' in May and kicked off a world tour this summer. And although the material in this show is largely archival, it still generates a charge of anarchic heat, of which the present rather staid local art scene could certainly use a dose.</p>
        <p>And Printed Matter could use a new home. This nonprofit bookstore-gallery began life around the same time Sonic Youth did, as a publisher and distributor of artists' books. (It just distributes now.) After decades in SoHo, its lease is up and it is looking to move, destination unknown. It is an invaluable resource, one of the largest distributors of its kind around. And who would do shows like this if it didn't? Let's hope it lands on its feet.</p>
