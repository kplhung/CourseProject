        <p>David Cone will depart from Tampa, Fla., with Orlando Hernandez, Allen Watson and the pitching instructor Billy Connors today and return to Yankee Stadium with several questions still hovering. Cone is scheduled to make his next start against the Seattle Mariners tomorrow and it is fair to wonder if it might be his last start of the season.</p>
        <p>Cone is in the midst of a horrendous season in which he has gone 1-10 with a 6.88 earned run average and has not won in his last 14 starts. George Steinbrenner ordered Cone to go to Tampa to work with Connors, who helped turn Dwight Gooden and Roger Clemens around, and Connors tutored Cone on improving his breaking pitches and, more than anything, regaining his confidence.</p>

        <p>David Cone will depart from Tampa, Fla., with Orlando Hernandez, Allen Watson and the pitching instructor Billy Connors today and return to Yankee Stadium with several questions still hovering. Cone is scheduled to make his next start against the Seattle Mariners tomorrow and it is fair to wonder if it might be his last start of the season.</p>
        <p>Cone is in the midst of a horrendous season in which he has gone 1-10 with a 6.88 earned run average and has not won in his last 14 starts. George Steinbrenner ordered Cone to go to Tampa to work with Connors, who helped turn Dwight Gooden and Roger Clemens around, and Connors tutored Cone on improving his breaking pitches and, more than anything, regaining his confidence.</p>
        <p>But throwing batting practice against some minor leaguers in a controlled environment is dramatically different from what Cone will encounter in his next start. The sand in the hourglass of Cone's superb career is dwindling, vanishing faster than he ever expected it to.</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre remained supportive of Cone, hoping that Cone ends his months of pitching misery.</p>
        <p>''I'm convinced that he has pitching ability left,'' Torre said. ''I don't think Coney is at the end of his career. This is bad luck. I'm not saying that he's pitched well. Don't get me wrong. He's done enough to warrant a win here.''</p>
        <p>Cone rebounded from aneurysm surgery to help the Yankees win a World Series championship in 1996, he won 20 games during the incredible 1998 season and he tossed a perfect game against Montreal on July 18, 1999 and then pitched well in the postseason a year ago.</p>
        <p>But Cone, who is 61-36 as a Yankee and is one of the premier pitchers of his era, has crumbled into a 37-year-old who is sputtering and searching. Cone's start will be heavily scrutinized because he is one poor start away from a very uncertain future.</p>
        <p>Gooden's improbable revival from being out of baseball to going 3-0 with a 1.86 E.R.A. has increased the possibility that Cone could be removed from the rotation. Gooden has displayed aggressiveness, consistency and confidence, traits that have been missing from Cone's starts this year. Cone has not won since he beat Toronto on April 28.</p>
        <p>Either Gooden or Hernandez is scheduled to start on Sunday and Torre said it is possible that he would use a six-man rotation for at least one turn, which would enable Gooden to remain in the rotation. Gooden reiterated his willingness to go to the bullpen, saying, ''I think we're a better team with me there, because that means Coney got back on track.''</p>
        <p>Cone has always been able to adjust, but his fastball has been sluggish and his slider has not had its usual bite. Still, Torre seemingly indicated that Cone, after one week in Tampa, would get more than one start to use what Connors has taught him and rectify his pitching.</p>
        <p>''David Cone is a starter,'' Torre said. ''There's no way I want to abandon what he's meant to this club. I still believe, if he's going to be straightened out, it's as a starter. Hopefully, Saturday, we'll see some results.''</p>
        <p>Torre does not have much time to allow Cone to fizzle because the Yankees went into last night with a three-game lead over the second-place Red Sox in the A.L. East. Cone has his next start and maybe one other to prove that he can still help the Yankees get to the postseason.</p>
        <p>''With what has happened, I want to see something positive,'' Torre said. ''Go get that first win over with.''</p>
