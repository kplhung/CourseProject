        <p>In another sign of Michael Ovitz's return to power as a Hollywood deal-maker, Mr. Ovitz has persuaded the best-selling thriller writer Tom Clancy to defect from his longtime agent Robert Gottlieb at the William Morris Agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gottlieb was irate at the news. He discovered Mr. Clancy's first manuscript, ''The Hunt for Red October,'' 18 years ago at a book fair. Mr. Gottlieb went on to negotiate contracts for 47 of his books, roughly 10 of them still be to published, along with film, television and other deals.</p>

        <p>In another sign of Michael Ovitz's return to power as a Hollywood deal-maker, Mr. Ovitz has persuaded the best-selling thriller writer Tom Clancy to defect from his longtime agent Robert Gottlieb at the William Morris Agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gottlieb was irate at the news. He discovered Mr. Clancy's first manuscript, ''The Hunt for Red October,'' 18 years ago at a book fair. Mr. Gottlieb went on to negotiate contracts for 47 of his books, roughly 10 of them still be to published, along with film, television and other deals.</p>
        <p>''Clancy was raided,'' Mr. Gottlieb said. ''What Mike Ovitz has done is put his company in an adversarial position with a major agency. I believe it is open season on him.'' Mr. Gottlieb said Mr. Ovitz had similarly alienated Creative Artists Agency, another major agency, by luring away the actor Robin Williams.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ovitz first rose to prominence in Hollywood as the founder of Creative Artists Agency but quit for a 14-month career as a studio executive at the Walt Disney Company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ovitz had previously advised Mr. Clancy on film and television deals but will now take over his representation completely, including negotiating book contracts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ovitz began managing Mr. Clancy's film and movie deals two years ago, when he returned to Hollywood to open Artists Management Group, a talent management firm with a sideline producing its own films and television shows.</p>
        <p>An agent represents a client, collecting generally 10 percent of his earnings and helps negotiates contracts. Managers do not negotiate contracts but oversee a client's career, often collecting 15 percent. In recent years the line between the two have become increasingly blurred.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clancy had said previously that he was unhappy that just four of his many thrillers had been made into films. Mr. Ovitz's firm recently began producing a film based on Mr. Clancy's novel ''Rainbow Six.''</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Ovitz nor Mr. Clancy were available for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gottlieb said that Mr. Ovitz's poaching would soon make him a ''pariah.''</p>
        <p>No agent would refer a client to Mr. Ovitz in his role as a Hollywood business manager if he began trying to steal their business as agents as well, Mr. Gottlieb said. ''He has made it clear that he is neither fish nor fowl, neither agent nor manager nor lawyer.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the William Morris Agency said Mr. Gottlieb spoke only for himself, not the agency.</p>
