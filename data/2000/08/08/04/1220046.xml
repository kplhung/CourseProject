        <p>Ken Johnson reviews exhibition of works by the German Conceptualist Hans-Peter Feldmann at 303 Gallery (M)</p>

        <p>303 Gallery</p>
        <p>525 West 22nd Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through next Friday</p>
        <p>The German Conceptualist Hans-Peter Feldmann earned an insider's reputation in Europe during the late 1960's and early 1970's for his understated play with books, photographs and found materials. This show of new and old works is not visually exciting but it has a dry, Dada-esque wit.</p>
        <p>''Photographs Taken From Hotel Room Windows While Traveling,'' a recently completed piece, clusters 108 nondescript, unframed snapshots of buildings, streets and parking lots. (Like other Feldmann projects, this calls to mind Ed Ruscha's photographic catalogs.) ''11 Left Shoes'' presents 11 shoes borrowed from 303 Gallery employees, in a row on the floor. ''Que Sera'' has the words of the song of that title handwritten on the wall. ''Bed With Photograph,'' the show's most physically substantial yet most oblique work, simulates part of a hotel room with a slept-in bed, a side table and a framed photograph of a woman in leopard-print pants.</p>

        <p>The German Conceptualist Hans-Peter Feldmann earned an insider's reputation in Europe during the late 1960's and early 1970's for his understated play with books, photographs and found materials. This show of new and old works is not visually exciting but it has a dry, Dada-esque wit.</p>
        <p>''Photographs Taken From Hotel Room Windows While Traveling,'' a recently completed piece, clusters 108 nondescript, unframed snapshots of buildings, streets and parking lots. (Like other Feldmann projects, this calls to mind Ed Ruscha's photographic catalogs.) ''11 Left Shoes'' presents 11 shoes borrowed from 303 Gallery employees, in a row on the floor. ''Que Sera'' has the words of the song of that title handwritten on the wall. ''Bed With Photograph,'' the show's most physically substantial yet most oblique work, simulates part of a hotel room with a slept-in bed, a side table and a framed photograph of a woman in leopard-print pants.</p>
        <p>Works from the early 1970's include 70 snapshots depicting ''All the Clothes of a Woman'' and four ''Time Series'' projects including, for example, a row of 36 pictures of a ship moving along a river. There is a mercurial, mildly amusing poetry in all this, but none of it is very startling at this point in history. Mr. Feldman's photographic essays might have a more intimate singularity in book form. The one book on view -- ''Secret Picturebook'' (1973) -- is a thick, densely printed, scholarly tome with little pictures of women's torsos in sexy underwear inserted at intervals. It most pointedly embodies the artist's mischievous relationship to high culture.</p>
