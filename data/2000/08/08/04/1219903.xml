        <p>AS far as I'm concerned, it can't be demonstrated too often that the aesthetic principles considered basic to modernism are neither very recent nor especially Western. It's as comforting as it is humbling, the idea that the 20th century didn't create modernism from scratch, that it's not a relatively local, possibly exhausted aberration whose death one may celebrate or mourn. Whatever it is, the desire for simplicity, directness and abstraction is part of our very humanity and repeatedly finds expression.</p>
        <p>The presence of what might be called the eternal modern can be felt in certain great examples of African, Egyptian and early Greek art and different kinds of Asian art. Right now this presence hovers like a beautiful mist over ''The Arts of Hon'ami Koetsu, Japanese Renaissance Master'' at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a small miracle of an exhibition that pays homage to a late-16th-century artist who has become known to scholars and admirers as the Leonardo of Japanese art.</p>
        <p>With 70 works in calligraphy, lacquer and ceramics, this is the first major show in the West devoted to Koetsu, who was born in 1558 and died in 1637. It comes with a sensitive installation; a catalog by an international team of scholars that details his achievement as never before and translates all the calligraphy; and some rarely lent work from Japanese museums, several important cultural properties among them. It is spread throughout three smallish galleries, where the low lighting required by its fragile works create an almost magical sense of time travel. (Fragility also dictates that nearly two-thirds of the show will be rotated starting on Sept. 19.)</p>
        <p>Like Leonardo, Koetsu was a polymath: versatile, erudite, technically adept and lastingly influential. As Leonardo was respected for his unparalleled draftsmanship, Koetsu was revered for his calligraphy, which he mastered in several styles, Chinese and Japanese. The show's spine is a progression of calligraphic works that range from early letters and a list of master swordsmiths -- Koetsu came from a family of prominent sword connoisseurs in Kyoto -- to Buddhist texts made at the end of his life, when he retreated with family and friends to Takagamine, a small village north of Kyoto built on land ceded to him by the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1615.</p>
        <p>The show's ethereal ambience is set by several examples of the works that Koetsu is perhaps most famous for, the poem scrolls and little poem cards on which he collaborated with the painter Tawaraya Sotatsu (who died circa 1640), sprinkling his flowing calligraphy over Sotatsu's equally effortless abbreviations of natural motifs -- a mountain slope, a stand of pines, a pair of deer, drifting chrysanthemums, clustered bellflowers or cherry blossoms.</p>
        <p>The opening work is one-half of a double six-fold seasonal screen whose lovely garden image was painted in the late 1600's in the manner of Sotatsu but whose small square poem cards are thought to be Sotatsu's and Koetsu's first collaboration. They punctuate the surface of the image like a series of elegant thought balloons or close-up views of nature's calendar. These complex little addenda of script and image (the labels translated) in particular attune the viewer to the exquisitely nuanced responses to nature that lie at the core of Japanese art.</p>
        <p>Nearby, the show's first gallery includes later, more dynamic poem-card collaborations between Koetsu and Sotatsu, mounted on hanging scrolls or displayed in an album, that are astounding for their offhand power and varieties of pictorial space and scale. In these seemingly minimal works Koetsu's calligraphy hovers above landscapes, floats beneath waves that dance with the reflections of trees or dangles among peach blossoms like tendrils of vine or moss. Here, the viewer can acquire an instant initiation into the splendors of calligraphy, an exceptionally accessible work.</p>
        <p>Also like Leonardo, Koetsu's achievement can have an elusive quicksilver quality, and his legacy of ideas, taste and design may be almost as important as anything he actually touched. An inveterate collaborator and, one suspects, something of a charismatic, he is also sometimes called the world's first ''art director.'' For example, it is thought that he never actually worked in lacquer, but excelled at its design and was responsible for the introduction of base metals, which set up a rich contrast with the more traditional silver and gold, as exemplified by a small writing box that features a reed boat in lead inlay.</p>
        <p>Koetsu's multifaceted career thrived during the brief, brilliant Momoyama period (1573-1615), which served as the glittering hinge between medieval and early modern Japan. This four-decade cultural renaissance ensued when the country was finally united under the authority of the successive warlords Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Tokugawa after more than 100 years of civil disorder and social fragmentation.</p>
        <p>It was an age of building, recovery and revival, extensive cultural patronage and competitive displays of ostentation. All the arts seem to have been called up for active duty. The castles being built at a rather frantic pace in and around Kyoto required lavish furnishings and decorations, especially painted screens and panels, and the more gold leaf the better.</p>
        <p>As a member of the mercantile elite of Kyoto, Koetsu was connected to artists and artisans of all kinds, and also trained in a discipline,  sword connoisseurship, that involved  a series of skills, effects and materials both decorative and practical. Swords and their sheaths involved fine forging, metalwork and lacquer. Even sword polishing, which was Koetsu's specialty until his late 40's, was close to an art form.</p>
        <p>But Koetsu had several pans on the fire. He was a respected practitioner of the tea ceremony, gatherings that served as artistic and literary salons in Momoyama Kyoto. He figured in the surge in book publishing that began in the late 16th century, working with a Kyoto-based publisher to produce high-quality editions of classical literature. (His calligraphy served as a model for the design of the woodblock typeface that made these books possible.)</p>
        <p>He was especially familiar with the aristocratic traditions of the Heian period (794-1185), Japan's first golden age, which saw the founding of its calligraphy and literature and exerted a refining influence over the frequent exuberance of Momoyama.</p>
        <p>He became both a connoisseur and master of calligraphy, possibly studying in his late 30's under Prince Soncho, less for the latter's calligraphic talents than his hereditary position as abbot of the Shoren-in monastery, an important repository of ancient Chinese and Japanese calligraphy. And although records are sketchy, he was involved enough with the production of lacquers, whether as a designer, adviser or influence, that the term Koetsu lacquerware continues to connote a certain boldness of shape and surface decoration.</p>
        <p>Finally, at Takagamine, where he spent more and more time after 1615, he devoted himself seriously to raku ceramics, then a relatively new form. (It had emerged in late 1570's, when Sen no Rikyu, the period's most influential tea ceremony master -- and thus an important arbiter of taste -- asked Chojiro, a maker of exceptionally handsome roof tiles, to  adapt his techniques to the making of tea bowls.)</p>
        <p>An unusual combination of hands-on technique and aestheticism came together in Koetsu, and it is reflected in this show, which is noticeably low on the technical fireworks and dazzling material display that were so central to the Momoyama period. Koetsu's art exemplifies some of the most essential elements of the Japanese sensibility, including its signal indifference to the distinction between art and craft, or the migration of similar motifs from one medium to another. Deer graze among the calligraphy in Koetsu and Sotatsu's famous Deer Scroll and also along the slender cylinder of a lacquer flute case. A rabbit thought to have been drawn by Koetsu appears on a fan and also hides among the grasses on a little salmon-colored incense container.</p>
        <p>But Koetsu also exemplifies what might be called the ''other'' Momoyama, which adhered more closely to the often rarefied ideals of the Heian period. Gold as used here is just one of several almost always transparent tones. The main metallic glow comes from the covers and pages of the printed books he was involved with, for example, Noh libretti decorated with faint natural motifs and patterns in mica, a Heian invention, that are most visible from a raking angle.</p>
        <p>Koetsu's achievement may have been to renew Heian otherworldliness by bringing it down to earth, giving it an understated but undeniable directness of touch. We do not gasp at the technical prowess of these works and wonder how they were made. Their making is always visible. In fact, it is the heart of the work: we can see the quick, unlabored strokes of the brush, the flow of ink and paint, the natural give and take between language and form with their unending spatial interactions.</p>
        <p>As if to underscore the tactility and intimacy of Koetsu's art, this exhibition includes two of the most ingenious uses of interactive computers yet to invade an art museum. These enable the viewer to virtually hold and manipulate a digital facsimile of the Crane Scroll, Koetsu's most famous collaboration with Sotatsu (which will be part of the September rotation) , and his black and rust raku ''Shichiri (Seven Leagues)'' tea bowl, feeling the textures and asymmetries of its surface while observing the pictorial subtleties of its glaze on a small screen.</p>
        <p>Nine of the 20 raku tea bowls attributed to Koetsu -- including the ''Shichiri'' -- conclude the exhibition, some with the more traditional rounded hip, others with the squarish one that he originated. Each has a shape and surface that is completely its own and, like so much else here, looks as if it were made yesterday.</p>
        <p>''The Arts of Hon'ami Koetsu, Japanese Renaissance Master'' will remain at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Benjamin Franklin Parkway at 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, through Oct. 29.</p>
