        <p>Nieves Pena watched in admiration a year and a half ago as her mother voted to unionize the garment district factory in which she worked, one that made handbags for Kate Spade.</p>
        <p>But when Ms. Pena tried to help start a union in June at her own factory, KC Accessories, which also happened to make Kate Spade bags,  she ran into a wall, she said. The owner, Kulwant Chouhan, pulled her aside and told her not to talk about a union, she said. Then, on June 30, he dismissed all 50 or so workers, most of them Latino immigrants, she said. Later, she said, he rehired about 20 who were not union sympathizers.</p>
        <p>''He can do anything he wants,'' said Ms. Pena, who came from the Dominican Republic in 1998. ''There's a reason why we want to join a union.''</p>
        <p>The Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing KC Accessories, at 22 West 32nd Street, of anti-union practices. Mr. Chouhan's lawyer has denied the allegations, and an investigation is pending. But yesterday, Ms. Pena joined two dozen protesters outside a Kate Spade boutique in SoHo to denounce her former employer and to ask Kate Spade to put pressure on Mr. Chouhan.</p>
        <p>The action against KC Accessories is the latest in a series of complaints against high-end designers and the contractors who do much of their manufacturing.</p>
        <p>Kate Spade has taken the stance that it has no control over the labor practices of its contractors. ''They're not our employees; it's not our business,'' said Elyce Cox, a partner at Kate Spade, which had more than $60 million in revenue last year.</p>
        <p>Steven Post, a lawyer who represents both KC Accessories and Kate Spade, denied the allegations against Mr. Chouhan. ''KC Accessories complies with all applicable labor laws and regulations,'' he said. ''We believe that KC Accessories will be vindicated by the National Labor Relations Board after the board has had the opportunity to review all of the circumstances and not just one side of the story, as it has now.''</p>
        <p>The workers said that in June, Mr. Chouhan began meeting with workers one by one to discourage them from forming a union. This came after some workers had already approached Unite about unionizing the shop, and had begun to collect signatures from their colleagues, Ms. Pena said. Then on June 30, hours after Unite representatives went to the shop to ask Mr. Chouhan to recognize the union, Mr. Chouhan dismissed his employees, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pena said she worked 40 to 50 hours a week and earned $6.50 an hour, but was never paid extra for working overtime or holidays. She said she also did not receive health benefits.</p>
        <p>Also on June 30, Unite filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board for the factory workers to hold a vote on whether to form a union. The election is scheduled for Tuesday, but union officials are asking the government to cancel the vote because they say that in mid-July, Mr. Chouhan rehired only those workers who are anti-union.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, garment workers and union officials marched outside the Kate Spade store while a well-dressed man stood inside the display window and thumbed his nose at them. Minutes later, he stormed outside and grabbed a stack of pamphlets from one woman and ran back into the store. Then he rushed back outside, slammed his elbow into the face of a photographer and walked quickly down the street, witnesses said. Police officers said the man was a Kate Spade employee.</p>
