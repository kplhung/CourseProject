        <p>The Clinton 2000 campaign dubbed it the Long Island tour, with the candidate pitching what she was calling the ''Long Island livability plan.''</p>
        <p>For three days, staid and sensible in cream and navy blue suits, Hillary Rodham Clinton trolled for support in the heart of her rival's home turf, stopping off to meet with local officials, offer succor to elderly residents, dine with fishermen on the far East End. Not only that, she spent that time confronting the very issues that her opponent for the United States Senate, Rick A. Lazio, the Republican congressman from Long Island, has seized upon: lower taxes one day, abortion rights another, the environment the next.</p>
        <p>Today was the environment's turn. With the Long Island Sound as her backdrop and the sun occasionally poking out of the clouds in the morning, Mrs. Clinton rattled off a laundry list of earth-friendly concerns, from the quality of drinking water in the state to suburban sprawl to the plight of the lobsters that have been dying off mysteriously in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>''A livable Long Island must be an environmentally sound Long Island,'' she said. ''It bothers me that lobsters have died off. What does that mean not only to the lobsters but to children and the rest of us. What also bothers me is Long Island has the highest rates of breast cancer.''</p>
        <p>And so it went today, with Mrs. Clinton touching on everything from the construction of a water filtration plant in the Bronx, which she opposes, to requiring municipalities to report water quality standards online, which she supports. She pointed to her own advocacy for financing breast cancer research. She lauded the vice president, Al Gore, for ''his foresight on the environment.'' And she attacked Mr. Lazio's environmental record.</p>
        <p>She declined to offer detailed criticism of his environmental positions. But she once again linked Mr. Lazio to the reign of Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, saying that as a deputy whip, Mr. Lazio had voted in favor of measures that would have weakened enforcement of federal environmental laws.</p>
        <p>Finding Where to Go</p>
        <p>The Long Island tour has been a combination of well-choreographed  visits with well-wishers and spontaneous sojourns along the way. Today, Mrs. Clinton solicited local reporters for ideas on where to go on the East End. (They suggested a park or two, spots to find fishermen, diverse crowds. Mrs. Clinton's advance team said they would consult their Hagstrom's guide to Long Island.)</p>
        <p>So Where's Chelsea?</p>
        <p>Today was the first time during Mrs. Clinton's Long Island jaunt that she was not joined by her daughter, Chelsea, 20, who is taking the fall semester off from college to help her mother campaign and spend the last few months of her father's tenure at the White House. Chelsea Clinton has turned out to be almost as much of a crowd-pleaser as her mother this week.</p>
        <p>Trailing the first lady Tuesday and Wednesday from park to senior center to luncheons with advocates and politicians, Ms. Clinton, predictably, was no shrinking violet. She had a fixed wide grin. She thanked her mother's well-wishers, addressed the men as ''Sir,'' attributing it to her Southern upbringing, signed autographs and posed readily for pictures, asking simply, ''Where would you like me to stand?''</p>
        <p>The only exception was the news media. Chelsea, fiercely protected from the press during the last seven and a half years of her father's presidency, said nothing to reporters. She has appeared at her mother's side only occasionally during Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign.</p>
        <p>Today, Mrs. Clinton said her daughter had returned to Washington to see some friends. ''I am a strong advocate for young people leading their own lives and not being taken advantage of by people in the public arena,'' she said. ''I'll be looking forward to having her back.''</p>
        <p>It was not clear whether Chelsea Clinton would rejoin her mother as she heads to Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard for the weekend. There will be a fund-raiser on Friday in Nantucket and another will be held on Sunday in Martha's Vineyard.</p>
        <p>The Lobster Issue</p>
        <p>During her Long Island trip, Mrs. Clinton has addressed some of Mr. Lazio's main issues. Towing the Republican Party line, he has long spoken of the need for tax breaks. He has described himself as being in favor of abortion rights but an opponent of using public money to pay for abortions for poor women. He has also called himself an environmentalist, and won endorsements from the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters in his Congressional races.</p>
        <p>Today, Mrs. Clinton also painted herself as the friend of Long Island lobstermen by noting that her opponent voted with the Republicans against an emergency appropriations bill that would have included money for the lobster industry.</p>
        <p>Lazio campaign aides swiftly put out an afternoon news release attacking the Clinton administration for ''arbitrarily small quotas'' on the number of fluke that New York fishermen are allowed to catch for sale. As for the lobstermen, they said Mr. Lazio had fought to include $8 million for lobstermen in the emergency spending bill but voted against it because it spun off into a bigger, far more expensive measure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio dismissed the very notion of the ''livability plan'' put forth by Mrs. Clinton. ''If she ever lived on Long Island,'' he told reporters, ''she would have some basis to talk about a livability plan.''</p>
