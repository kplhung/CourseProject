        <p>The New York Power Authority called upon seven of its biggest customers in New York City to voluntarily reduce their electrical load today in preparation for hot, muggy weather, but later canceled the request after the day remained overcast and cool.</p>
        <p>Those seven customers -- the Bank of New York, Chase Manhattan Bank, Citibank, J. P. Morgan, the New York City government, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- adopted energy-saving measures at 19 locations for what was supposed to be a six-hour period beginning at 11 a.m. today under a prearranged agreement with the power authority.</p>
        <p>The companies shut down some of their elevators, turned off lights and, in some cases, raised the air-conditioning settings slightly to ease the power authority's electrical load by a total of 16.2 megawatts. But by 2:30 p.m., the power had been fully restored at most of these companies with few, if any, complaints by workers or visitors.</p>
        <p>''People would barely notice these things,'' said Alan Reiss, director of the World Trade Center, which reduced its daily summer load of 75 megawatts by 2 megawatts. ''They'd see an elevator out of service while we'd take advantage of it and go in and do some maintenance. It's not a dramatic reduction.''</p>
        <p>Michael Saltzman, a spokesman for the power authority, said it had taken the precaution of asking for the reduction on Wednesday to prevent any disruption in service if the demand soared today. It was the second time it had called on those seven customers this year; the first time was during six hours in June when the temperature climbed into the 80's.</p>
        <p>The authority, which generates one-quarter of the state's electricity supply, sells to public and private utilities and companies.</p>
        <p>''I want to emphasize this is not an emergency situation that anyone has to be alarmed about,'' Mr. Saltzman said. ''What it has to do with is ensuring reliable electrical service for our customers during periods of high energy demand.''</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, California and other states around the country have been coping with shortages brought on by increasing demand for electricity during the summer months coupled with a limited supply, due in part to earlier deregulation of utilities industries that made it unprofitable to build more power plants.</p>
        <p>Ken Klapp, a spokesman for the New York Independent System Operator, which controls the state's power grid, said that energy use had been lower than expected so far because of the lower temperatures this summer. The group had predicted a peak load of 30,200 megawatts for the summer months, but it has not yet been reached. The highest load for July was 26,078 megawatts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klapp said the electrical load between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. today, which is typically the heaviest time, measured 25,400 megawatts. ''That's not unusual,'' he said. ''Everybody realizes that June and July have been mild.''</p>
        <p>Consolidated Edison, which supplies power to three million customers in New York City and Westchester, said it had not ordered any energy-saving measures today. Its electrical load was 10,188 megawatts this afternoon, much lower than its record peak load of 11,850 megawatts in July 1999. ''We realize that while reserves are tight, we still have enough energy to meet the load,'' said D. Joy Faber, a spokeswoman for Con Edison.</p>
