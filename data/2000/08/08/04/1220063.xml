        <p>In another victory for Donald J. Trump in a long-running legal battle, an appeals court yesterday upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit seeking to prevent him from building the world's tallest residential tower near the United Nations building.</p>
        <p>A coalition of neighborhood and civic groups sued the Buildings Department and the Board of Standards and Appeals in October, contending that a building permit should not have been issued for the 70-story Trump World Tower on First Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets.</p>

        <p>In another victory for Donald J. Trump in a long-running legal battle, an appeals court yesterday upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit seeking to prevent him from building the world's tallest residential tower near the United Nations building.</p>
        <p>A coalition of neighborhood and civic groups sued the Buildings Department and the Board of Standards and Appeals in October, contending that a building permit should not have been issued for the 70-story Trump World Tower on First Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets.</p>
        <p>In yesterday's ruling, a three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Manhattan agreed with Justice Nicholas Figueroa's Dec. 1 decision that the agencies had interpreted the complex and ambiguous zoning regulations rationally and were entitled to deference.</p>
        <p>Seymour Flug, the former chairman of the Diners Club and one of several prominent opponents of the building, said the group would seek a reversal from the Court of Appeals.  He and other residents say the 861-foot tower does not fit into the neighborhood.</p>
