        <p>Prosecutors broadened their case against a suspected teenage hacker today, adding dozens of charges that accuse the boy of paralyzing several of the  most popular Web sites in the United States beginning on Feb. 7.</p>
        <p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has evidence that the boy, who turned 16 on July 17, is responsible for attacks on the Web sites of Yahoo, Amazon, AtLaw, eBay and Dell, said Staff Sgt. Jean-Pierre Roy.</p>
        <p>In April, the prosecutor in the case, Louis Miville-Deschenes, charged the boy with three counts of criminal mischief related to attacks on the CNN Web site. Today, he added 64 criminal charges related to attacks on the other five sites.</p>
        <p>''We now have direct evidence that places him behind the computer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The suspect, who under Canadian law cannot be identified but who prosecutors say uses the online name Mafiaboy, made his first appearance in youth court today as his lawyer entered a plea of not guilty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miville-Deschenes said that he was ''prosecuting this case as a deterrent.''</p>
        <p>Sergeant Roy added that the police were now working on at least 20 other computer-related cases. Although more arrests are expected, he said that there was no evidence of accomplices in the Mafiaboy case.</p>
        <p>Earlier reports had linked the Mafiaboy name to a cybergang called TNT, some of whose members are accused of stealing credit card information belonging to Internet shoppers. But Sergeant Roy said no personal information about users of the victim sites was compromised. ''It was strictly denial of service,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miville-Deschenes acknowledged, however, that sealed court files contains information that could prove harmful to some of the corporations that it names.</p>
        <p>A distributed denial of service attack like the ones Mafiaboy is said to have committed involves bombarding a Web site's computers with thousands of useless messages a minute. The huge volume makes it impossible to serve legitimate users. The attacker does not do this directly. Rather, he uses telephone lines to gain access to large computers linked to the Internet and then programs these computers to send the deluge of useless data, multiplying the congestion and masking the source of the attack.</p>
        <p>Mafiaboy is suspected of using at least 54 computers to stage his attacks. Most belonged to universities, including the University of California at Santa Barbara. Sergeant Roy said the suspect also used at least two computers in Korea.</p>
        <p>If the event of a conviction, the maximum penalty the suspect could face as a juvenile under Canadian law is two years in custody and a fine of $1,000. In addition, the criminal record could be wiped clean five years after the sentence was served.</p>
        <p>''There could have been more than 100 charges,'' Sergeant Roy said. ''We decided to set a limit. We don't see why we should add more charges. There is no reason to go further to identify more attacks.''</p>
        <p>Both the prosecutor and the suspect's lawyer agreed that the trial could last three to four months. ''This will be the longest youth court trial ever,'' Mr. Miville-Deschenes said. He added that the police collected 50 days of digital and telephone wiretap evidence and that each day of wiretapping consumes 40 hours of testimony.</p>
        <p>The police questioned the boy about the attacks two months before arresting him in April, before the investigation was complete.</p>
        <p>The hacking trial is scheduled for Sept. 28. The suspect is free on bail but is prohibited from using a computer except at school, and then only for academic purposes with supervision. He may not connect to the Internet or go to any establishment that rents or sells computers. He is subject to a curfew of midnight to 7 a.m.  unless accompanied by a specified adult, except when he works a late shift at a local restaurant.</p>
