        <p>It will be 96 days before Republicans know if Gov. George W.

        <p>It will be 96 days before Republicans know if Gov. George W. Bush was right to bypass standard G.O.P. ideological fare and center this convention on the twin themes of inclusion and personal testimony. But in his well-crafted, highly autobiographical acceptance speech last night, Mr. Bush sought to incite a public appetite for change based on a claim of bringing a new style of leadership to the White House. With flashes of wit and biting ridicule, Mr. Bush derided Vice President Al Gore as the risk-averse partner in an administration that ''has coasted through prosperity.'' Ending his embargo on direct attacks, he said: ''They had their chance. They have not led. We will.'' The underlying invitation was for voters to take a leap of faith on the promise that Mr. Bush will develop into a more effective, resolute and likable leader and role model than Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>This presentation of an admittedly late-blooming candidate as a work in progress carries certain risks. Not since Jimmy Carter has there been a presidential candidate to whom the act of introducing himself to the American people -- of making himself known, trusted and familiar as well as simply famous -- was more important. The speech marked the toughest test the new nominee will face before the debates this fall.</p>
        <p>The irony of Mr. Bush's situation right now is that, despite the renowned father saluted in the speech, he is actually not very well known even to many supporters. He characterized his six-year stint as governor of Texas as one in which he learned to make tough decisions and work with Democrats. But serving in Austin and having many of his father's advisers around him now will probably have less meaning to the voters than Mr. Bush's attempt to define himself as a man from a different political culture than the one he said was epitomized by Mr. Gore and President Clinton.</p>
        <p>In raising two previously unmentionable issues,  he affirmed opposition to abortion and support for enforcement of existing gun laws. But in vowing fervently to ''tear down that wall'' that traps the poor and minorities in prisons and failed schools, he fleshed out more of what he has meant by ''compassionate conservatism,'' implying actual delivery on the ''kinder and gentler'' Republican policies promised some years ago by his father.</p>
        <p>Running a campaign for change is complicated by the fact that Americans are satisfied with the economy, and the polls show them broadly supporting the Democrats' approach on budget issues, as well as education, health care and Social Security. The oratorical doorway for Mr. Bush has been to speak from, and about, his heart as a way of suggesting a more expansive governance without really altering the ideological straitjacket that his party requires its nominees to wear.</p>
        <p>The glue that is supposed to hold all this together is his promise of personality suited to the office, yet free of historical baggage. In service of that theme, Mr. Bush invoked the values of Midland and boasted that he would come to Washington without inherited enemies and with ''no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years.'' He asserted that his would be an administration guided by convictions and character rather than polls and focus groups.</p>
        <p>A world of difference lies between Mr. Bush and Ronald Reagan, the last G.O.P. nominee to stir the kind of hope among Republicans that could be heard last night. But like Mr. Reagan, Mr. Bush promised that if given a chance he would rise above expectations, and like Mr. Reagan, he is attempting to create a market for change in the summer convention and then cash in this fall. Also like Mr. Reagan, he promised a regime of homespun values in place of the policy sophistication or taste for legislative maneuvering of Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>In reality, this down-home emphasis is sharply at odds with the privileged educational and financial background of Mr. Bush and many of the delegates here -- a condition that has led some to say this ought to be known as the illusion convention instead of the inclusion convention. But Democrats should make no mistake about the themes laid down here or the stump performance of George W. Bush and even that of his running mate, Richard B. Cheney. They represent a considerable danger for Mr. Gore and his party this fall.</p>
