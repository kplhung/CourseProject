        <p>There is no Steve in ''The Tao of Steve,'' the light-as-a-marshmallow romantic comedy directed by Jenniphr Goodman. But there is a universal ideal represented by a spiritual concept proposed by the main character, Dex: the pursuit of the perfection attained by all-American cool guys like Steve McQueen, Steve McGarrett (''Hawaii Five-0'') and Steve Austin (''The Six Million Dollar Man'').</p>
        <p>Dex (Donal Logue) never really explains why emulating McGarrett, a lawman who had roughly one romance a season and a propensity for chasing down hitmen from the mainland who had brought only one bullet with them, is a goal to which he aspires. (''Tao'' also may be a sleight-of-hand pun on the movie's setting, Santa Fe, N.M., near Taos.)</p>

        <p>There is no Steve in ''The Tao of Steve,'' the light-as-a-marshmallow romantic comedy directed by Jenniphr Goodman. But there is a universal ideal represented by a spiritual concept proposed by the main character, Dex: the pursuit of the perfection attained by all-American cool guys like Steve McQueen, Steve McGarrett (''Hawaii Five-0'') and Steve Austin (''The Six Million Dollar Man'').</p>
        <p>Dex (Donal Logue) never really explains why emulating McGarrett, a lawman who had roughly one romance a season and a propensity for chasing down hitmen from the mainland who had brought only one bullet with them, is a goal to which he aspires. (''Tao'' also may be a sleight-of-hand pun on the movie's setting, Santa Fe, N.M., near Taos.)</p>
        <p>Still, Dex is a likable guy, a walking epitome of the Peter Pan syndrome. Actually, he's more like a blobby epitome of that syndrome, a little boy unashamed of his rolls of flab. His size doesn't prevent him from scoring with the ladies, and his minor-league obsession with the Steves underscores his devotion to trivial matters.</p>
        <p>The movie is the story of Dex's infatuation with women and how he eventually has to deal with giving up his one-night stands to find spiritual truth with one woman, Syd (Greer Goodman, sister of the director, who worked on the screenplay with her and Duncan North). Dex's romping with his dog, a happy sun-colored Lab, and his ease with the preschoolers he teaches are part of what makes him so attractive to women. He explains himself to each potential conquest so that his lack of deviousness becomes part of his come-on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Logue's winning performance comes out of Dex's own amusement at the effort he puts into his pleasure-hunting, giving the lie to his apparent slacker vibe. He's very serious about not being serious. Dex's Taoism is fairly well worked out; he's a guy with too much time on his hands who has spent a lot of energy on his world view. He has quotes from ''Don Giovanni'' and Thomas Aquinas to rationalize his life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Logue's turn as Dex won him a deserved acting award at this year's Sundance Film Festival, and when he is onscreen the picture glides, in part because Dex has a cherub's glee over what he gets away with. Maybe too many movies celebrate extended adolescence, but Mr. Logue's breezy and innocent hedonism gives ''Tao'' a roughhouse affability. He is one of those actors you've probably caught out of the corner of your eye, the bad guy who gets one scene in a movie. (In ''The Patriot,'' he's the racist who quickly reforms.) If he has been biding his time and waiting for the chance to prove he can carry a movie, ''Tao'' shows he is up to the challenge.</p>
        <p>He plays off his avoirdupois, commenting on it before anyone else can and making it part of his arsenal. (At Sundance, he had a matinee-idol trimness as he accepted his award.) There's an ''if only he used his power for the good of mankind'' aspect here, as there almost always is in stories of unregenerate Lotharios. (''Tao'' does bring up ''Don Giovanni,'' after all.) It is evident that he is smart and wasting away -- well, intellectually, anyway -- and that all he needs is the right woman to bring things together.</p>
        <p>The movie bogs down when he starts to lavish the same attention on his courtship of Syd, who is still nursing a wound over having been one of his one-night stands. Ms. Goodman has to play the grown-up, and it's hard to tell if the writing for Syd is subpar or if she is stiff as an actress. Eventually, Dex's doughy sheepishness and his attempt to elevate his self-indulgent behavior by mixing in European philosophy along with Hollywood Boulevard icons feels a bit like a conceit. The cat-and-mouse game that he and Syd play stretches out because it's standard-issue plotting. ''The Tao of Steve'' can't redeem the moves toward its predictable happy ending. But the movie has a protagonist who has a great time getting there.</p>
        <p>''The Tao of Steve'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and profanity.</p>
