        <p>The hottest convention in town is perhaps not the obvious one made up of 15,000 journalists and an occasional Republican, but rather a more private one unfolding away from the television lights, one to which admission is based not on politics but on blood and marriage.</p>
        <p>''It is a family reunion,'' Laura Bush explained last month.</p>
        <p>Indeed, one of the conveniences of having a family active in presidential politics is that it offers a unique opportunity for quadrennial reunions with lots of balloons and confetti. Throngs of Bushes have been at all the Republican conventions since 1980, cheering one of their own at each one except for 1996, when they took a brief break.</p>
        <p>This time as well, scores of the extended Bush clan are on hand, and as George W. Bush gave his acceptance speech tonight, a spotlight illuminated his family: his parents, his twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna, as well as his sister and three brothers and all of their children.</p>
        <p>Most members of the extended family are staying at the Wyndham Hotel, along with the candidate himself. Security keeps the paparazzi away, but Karen P. Hughes, the candidate's chief spokeswoman, said the hall near her room was full of little Bushes charging up and down.</p>
        <p>The Bushes are, of course, less harassed by paparazzi than other prominent political families, like the Kennedys, but they are also more reticent, and George W.'s four siblings have mostly refused to give interviews about him this year.</p>
        <p>Still, perhaps sensing the friendly atmosphere, a few have emerged from the cocoon and one -- George P. Bush, the son of younger brother Jeb -- has become a hot media property, perhaps the most sought-after member of the clan among television producers after George W. himself.</p>
        <p>George P., 24, had a formal coming-out celebration of sorts when he addressed the convention tonight.</p>
        <p>Jeb and George P. together addressed a fund-raising luncheon on Wednesday for 3,000 people, offering a ''10-best'' list of reasons George W. should be elected president. These included ''will cut federal spending by using left-over 'From the desk of President Bush' note pads'' and ''I left a carry-on bag on Air Force One back in 1992, and I want it back.''</p>
        <p>The convention has seemed wary of giving too large a role to former President Bush, for fear of reinforcing public doubts about whether his son is his own man. But Barbara Bush was given the podium to introduce her son on Monday night when the candidate spoke briefly by satellite from Gettysburg, Pa., and the potential first lady, Laura, was given the chance to make a major speech on Monday.</p>
        <p>While George W. has stayed mostly in his hotel since coming to Philadelphia on Wednesday, watching the proceedings on television with family members and old friends -- several of his old fraternity pals from Yale are also staying at the Wyndham and hanging out with him and his family -- his parents have dutifully attended most convention sessions, logging more hours than many delegates. They sit in a family V.I.P. area just above the convention floor.</p>
        <p>Barbara Bush sits in the center, regularly leaping up to hug one relative or another straggling in to join the reunion, and is usually near her twin granddaughters. The girls have have resolutely stayed away from the mobs with microphones and notebooks, reflecting George and Laura Bush's efforts throughout their years in the Texas governor's mansion and on the campaign trail to retain their daughters' privacy. Early on, one of the girls was mortified when a television crew happened to be in the mansion and caught her father teasing her about a boy who was telephoning for her; ever since, the Bushes have generally kept the girls away from the cameras.</p>
        <p>One child who has been more public is Pierce Bush, the 14-year-old son of George W.'s younger brother Neil. This is already Pierce's third convention, and he appeared twice on CNN, praising his uncle the presidential candidate -- while disavowing his own interest in the job.</p>
        <p>''You don't really know,'' he said modestly in answer to a question about a political career, but he added: ''It runs in the family. What can I say?''</p>
        <p>Neil Bush, one of George W.'s younger brothers, has generally been the least inclined to talk to reporters in recent years, perhaps because of a general feeling in the clan that the news media treated him harshly when he was caught up in a savings-and-loan scandal in his father's administration. But he appeared briefly on Larry King Live on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>His younger brother Marvin, a management consultant in Texas, also gave a brief television interview. George W.'s sister, Dorothy, the youngest in the family, is here and, as a Maryland resident, cast her delegation's votes for her brother. And Jeb Bush tonight cast Florida's votes for his brother, as well.</p>
        <p>The family members declined to be interviewed and have generally been wary of the press, partly because of a feeling that reporters mistreated President Bush in 1992 and tend to be mocking George W. today.</p>
        <p>But the Bushes all have plenty of training and practice in looking like a loving, model family when the cameras are focused on the V.I.P. box (and probably when they are not, as well).</p>
        <p>In 1988, when President Bush was running for the White House, his advisers were worried that his Democratic rival, Michael S. Dukakis, came across as more lovey-dovey with his wife than President Bush did with his. ''I'm being advised to do that, reach out, hold Bar's hand,'' President Bush grumbled in a diary entry quoted in his memoirs, and he included a note that he wrote to his wife:</p>
        <p>''Sweetsie, Please look at how Mike and Kitty do it. Try to be closer in, more -- well er romantic -- on camera. I am practicing the loving look, and the creeping hand. Yours for better TV and more demonstrable affection. Your sweetie-pie coo-coo. Love 'ya. G.B.''</p>
