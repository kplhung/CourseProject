        <p>To beef up its contemporary-art holdings, the National Gallery of Art in Washington has acquired four early works by the installation artist James Turrell.</p>
        <p>And after hearing of the purchase, Mr. Turrell said he would give the gallery a fifth work.</p>
        <p>''He is certainly an artist whose work belongs in any museum,'' said Earl A. Powell 3rd, the gallery's director. ''We're beginning to focus on areas like Minimalism. We had no installation pieces in our collection.''</p>
        <p>The four projection pieces, bought with the help of the Brown Foundation in Houston, represent Mr. Turrell's early classic work from the 1960's. ''Royce'' and ''Artar'' are single-wall projections in which pure shapes are created with white light from a single projector. ''Amba'' and ''Orca,'' created with two projectors, are among the first of many works by the artist that fill an entire wall.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Weiss, head of the department of contemporary art, said that the work donated by Mr. Turrell could be an existing piece or a new one created specifically for the museum as part of his ''Space Division'' series, which, unlike the museum's other Turrell pieces, employs color. In this series, a single room is divided into two sections by a wall with an aperture. Each section has separate lighting, and the viewer stands in one space, looking through the opening into the other.</p>
        <p>The museum has not decided exactly when the Turrells will go on view, but is aiming for 2002, Mr. Weiss said. They are to be installed in the East Building, home to the gallery's collection of 20th-century art since it opened in 1978.</p>
        <p>New Market for Koons</p>
        <p>Jeff Koons has always gone for mass appeal. Every day this summer, hundreds of people have been paying homage to ''Puppy,'' the 43-foot-tall flower-covered topiary in the form of a West Highland terrier  displayed at Rockefeller Center. ''Split Rocker,'' a 40-foot tall topiary shaped like a rocking toy that is half pony, half dinosaur, has been on view in the Benoit XII Cloister in the Papal Palace in Avignon, France.</p>
        <p>In a similar spirit of accessibility (though with a price attached), Mr. Koons has signed a contract with eyestorm.com to sell photographic prints in editions of 1,000 of three of his 1999 paintings: ''Hair,'' ''Cut Out'' and ''Loopy.'' They will cost $500 each and be available at the end of the month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koons was traveling and could not be reached for comment, but Elizabeth Markevitch, the Internet company's vice president for content, said the prints ''will give the public the chance to own a Koons for $500.''</p>
        <p>''We're not targeting art-market people,'' she added, ''but rather consumers who find the art world intimidating or inaccessible.''</p>
        <p>A London-U.S. Merger</p>
        <p>Artemis Fine Arts, the London gallery that specializes in old master and 19th-century paintings, is joining forces with Lawrence Greenberg van Doren, which has galleries in New York and St. Louis offering a mixture of modern masters and emerging artists.</p>
        <p>The joint venture, to be called Artemis Greenberg van Doren, will focus mainly on modern American painters, like Sam Francis and Andy Warhol. ''Everyone can benefit from this,'' said Timothy Bathurst, a director of Artemis. ''It gives us a broader outreach and we're keen on the American market. We do a lot of business here.''</p>
        <p>A Boltanski for Boston</p>
        <p>The National Gallery of Art isn't the only encyclopedic museum finally paying attention to installation pieces.</p>
        <p>The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston commissioned the French Conceptualist Christian Boltanski to design a site-specific installation that will go on view on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The work, remaining through Nov. 9, is meant to complement another show, ''Charlotte Salomon: Life? Or Theater?'' which also opens on Wednesday; it runs through Oct. 29. Salomon, a Berlin-born artist, created a semi-autobiographical series of colorful gouaches before she died at Auschwitz at 26.</p>
        <p>Organized by the Royal Academy in London, the show was first exhibited in Amsterdam in 1961 and has been seen in Germany, France, Japan and England.</p>
        <p>''Having both works creates a great dialogue,'' said Cheryl Brutvan, curator of contemporary art at the Museum of Fine Arts. ''Both consider issues like memory in a different way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boltanski said he had agreed to make a site-specific piece for the museum because he admired Salomon's work and thought he could create a good complement to it. His work uses archival photographs of crimes from 14-year-old newspaper clippings. Half of the photographs show criminals and half show victims.</p>
        <p>They are illuminated on white fabric placed in the middle of a gallery. Black mirrors line the walls of the space.</p>
        <p>''It's about memory and faces and the issue of being guilty and not guilty,'' Mr. Boltanski said.</p>
        <p>The museum has other installation works on its schedule, including one by John Borofsky, most recently known for his large-scale sculptures, opening in the fall, and one by Sara Sze, the Manhattan-based installation artist, planned for next year.</p>
        <p>Hotelier to the Rescue</p>
        <p>With news that Christie's is contemplating building a hotel on the block it owns in St. James's, London, it may be fitting that the French-owned auction house has appointed an international chief operating officer with a background in hotel management.</p>
        <p>Jean-Claude Noel, 53, has worked at both Hilton International and TNT Post Group, a $9 billion leader in mail, communications and logistics.</p>
        <p>He will be based in New York, supervising the standard of client services and operational procedures for Christie's offices worldwide.</p>
        <p>INSIDE ART  Correction:  August 11, 2000, Friday  A brief report in the Inside Art column of Weekend last Friday about a joint venture agreement by two galleries misidentified the American partner of the London gallery Artemis Fine Arts Inc. The new venture, Artemis Greenberg Van Doren, is a partnership with the St. Louis gallery Greenberg Van Doren Inc. It does not involve Lawrence Rubin Greenberg Van Doren Fine Art of New York.</p>
