        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A July 28 letter writer suggested that ''the office of vice president is not needed'' since ''the office has no legal responsibilities other than to preside over the Senate,'' and ''those duties could easily be assumed by the Senate majority leader.'' Further, he writes, ''the senior member of the Senate from the president's party'' could assume the presidency if necessary.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A July 28 letter writer suggested that ''the office of vice president is not needed'' since ''the office has no legal responsibilities other than to preside over the Senate,'' and ''those duties could easily be assumed by the Senate majority leader.'' Further, he writes, ''the senior member of the Senate from the president's party'' could assume the presidency if necessary.</p>
        <p>Our recent experience has demonstrated the founding fathers' superior wisdom in designating the chief justice, rather than the vice president, to preside at a Senate trial after the House has impeached a president; the vice president suddenly becomes quite conflicted on this one issue. Of course, ''the senior member of the Senate from the president's party'' would then also be conflicted.</p>
