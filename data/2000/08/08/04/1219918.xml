        <p>AN offbeat new campaign embraces the philosophy of the comedian Jeff Foxworthy in declaring: ''No shirt. No shoes. . . . No problem!'' And what in the world are the shirtless hunks and hunkettes peddling in the ads? Shoes.</p>
        <p>The shoes in question are made by the Rockport Company, a division of Reebok International known for selling comfortable footwear that is, as the brand name implies, rock-solid, rock-steady -- and about as stylish as Plymouth Rock. The campaign, by AG Worldwide in New York, an agency that specializes in fashion advertising, seeks to change perceptions of the Rockport label as the company embarks on a redesign of its offerings to make them seem less stodgy.</p>

        <p>AN offbeat new campaign embraces the philosophy of the comedian Jeff Foxworthy in declaring: ''No shirt. No shoes. . . . No problem!'' And what in the world are the shirtless hunks and hunkettes peddling in the ads? Shoes.</p>
        <p>The shoes in question are made by the Rockport Company, a division of Reebok International known for selling comfortable footwear that is, as the brand name implies, rock-solid, rock-steady -- and about as stylish as Plymouth Rock. The campaign, by AG Worldwide in New York, an agency that specializes in fashion advertising, seeks to change perceptions of the Rockport label as the company embarks on a redesign of its offerings to make them seem less stodgy.</p>
        <p>The campaign begins with print advertisements, photographed in arty black and white, that depict bare feet being massaged, caressed and nuzzled by attractive nude young men and women. There will be outdoor posters in a similar vein, followed by a revamped Web site and television commercials.</p>
        <p>The Rockport account has been more peripatetic than a hiker climbing a mountain range in the company's shoes, moving in less than six years from Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London to the Leo Burnett unit of the B Com3 Group in Chicago to Kirshenbaum Bond &amp; Partners in New York to AG. The most recent previous campaign came from Kirshenbaum Bond, which handled the account for three years before resigning in September. Those ads, featuring personages ranging from Muhammad Ali to Ru Paul to Spalding Gray, carried this theme: ''Be comfortable. Uncompromise. Start with your feet.''</p>
        <p>''The idea of 'uncompromise' was a strong one,'' said Stefanie Lucas, recently named vice president for marketing at Rockport in Marlborough, Mass., ''because it talked about being uncompromising in the way you act and think.''</p>
        <p>''We did research showing consumers knew the brand was practical and well made, but there was really no emotional connection,'' she added. ''We knew that's what we needed to build and that's what drew us to AG and Peter Arnell.''</p>
        <p>Her reference was to Mr. Arnell, chairman and executive creative director at AG, which in March became part of the Draft Worldwide unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. AG, also known for developing and burnishing brand identities for marketers like Banana Republic, Hanes hosiery, Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan, Ray-Ban and Samsung, will introduce the theme ''Don't just walk'' to embody the new image of Rockport.</p>
        <p>''We're establishing a lifestyle versus pushing a shoe,'' said Mr. Arnell, who joined Ms. Lucas for a recent interview to offer a preview of the campaign, which is to be accompanied by a redesign by AG of the Rockport corporate identity including its logo, packages and stores.</p>
        <p>''The campaign is not driven by the seasons'' like other fashion-oriented advertising, Mr. Arnell said, ''but by a bigger idea, adoring the foot, expressing love for the foot.''</p>
        <p>The footwear category ''is getting a lot more crowded,'' he added, ''and the company felt it needed to break through.''</p>
        <p>In announcing its second-quarter earnings last week, Reebok reported that sales at Rockport fell 6.9 percent, to $96.8 million, compared with $104 million in the period a year earlier. In a statement, Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive of Reebok, directed the attention of analysts to Rockport's plans to introduce footwear that will ''comprise a significant portion of the Rockport product line and provide the consumer with new and refreshed looks while still adhering to Rockport's heritage of engineered comfort and fit.''</p>
        <p>Keeping customers who like Rockports for those features while attracting shoppers who buy footwear on looks is a trickier task than Sarah Jessica Parker faces when walking in high heels on ''Sex and the City.''</p>
        <p>''I would want people to say Rockport is modern but still comfortable,'' Ms. Lucas said.</p>
        <p>The budget for the campaign for the rest of 2000 is about $3 million; spending is to increase significantly next year, when four TV commercials featuring unclad and unshod models like the print ads and posters are to begin running.</p>
        <p>While the folks in the spots will be as barefoot as Robert Redford at the end of the Neil Simon film set around Washington Square Park, two will include shots of Rockport shoes.</p>
        <p>If one model in the Rockport campaign looks familiar, Mr. Arnell said, it is because he appeared in ads, posters and packages that Mr. Arnell designed and produced for Samsung. The model, Charles Andrews, was also shirtless then, toting a microwave oven.</p>
        <p>Maybe someday, Mr. Andrews will land a campaign for Arrow.</p>
