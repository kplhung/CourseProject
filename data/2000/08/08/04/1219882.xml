        <p>The rulers of Britain may have embarked on an aggressive campaign of modernization -- what with the Millennium Dome, the transformation of the House of Lords and all that throbbing techno music -- but a segment of the entertainment industry remains stubbornly wedded to ancient notions of the British character. The once-mighty empire remains, if recent movies are to be believed, a nation of absent-minded vicars, codgers and goosey, tea-swilling ladies who populate cozy crofts and seaside villages and manufacture eccentricity for the export market.</p>
        <p>''Saving Grace,'' which tries to do for marijuana-dealing what ''The Full Monty'' did for male striptease, is this summer's bait for the Anglophiles who keep shows like ''Mr. Bean'' and ''Keeping Up Appearances'' running on public television. Though it might be described as a BBC sitcom as imagined by Cheech and Chong, ''Saving Grace,'' directed by Nigel Cole, springs from the imagination of Craig Ferguson. Mr. Ferguson wrote the screenplay with Mark Crowdy and helped to produce the picture, in which he also stars.</p>

        <p>The rulers of Britain may have embarked on an aggressive campaign of modernization -- what with the Millennium Dome, the transformation of the House of Lords and all that throbbing techno music -- but a segment of the entertainment industry remains stubbornly wedded to ancient notions of the British character. The once-mighty empire remains, if recent movies are to be believed, a nation of absent-minded vicars, codgers and goosey, tea-swilling ladies who populate cozy crofts and seaside villages and manufacture eccentricity for the export market.</p>
        <p>''Saving Grace,'' which tries to do for marijuana-dealing what ''The Full Monty'' did for male striptease, is this summer's bait for the Anglophiles who keep shows like ''Mr. Bean'' and ''Keeping Up Appearances'' running on public television. Though it might be described as a BBC sitcom as imagined by Cheech and Chong, ''Saving Grace,'' directed by Nigel Cole, springs from the imagination of Craig Ferguson. Mr. Ferguson wrote the screenplay with Mark Crowdy and helped to produce the picture, in which he also stars.</p>
        <p>A regular on ''The Drew Carey Show'' on ABC and the writer and star of a recent big-screen hair-care comedy called ''The Big Tease,'' Mr. Ferguson is a leading contender for the title of World's Most Amusing Scot. Here he is fairly subdued in the role of Matthew, a transplanted Glaswegian working as a gardener in a picturesque town in Cornwall and enjoying, in addition to the traditional pint at the pub, a friendly toke or two with his pals, including the local doctor, played by the very amusing Martin Clunes.</p>
        <p>But then Matthew's employer, a local widow named Grace (Brenda Blethyn), encounters some serious money trouble, owing to the financial irresponsibility of her late husband, who has jumped from a plane, leaving her with a mountain of debt. Grace must raise $450,000 or lose her picturesque stone house, and so she and Matthew decide to clear the orchids from her greenhouse, install a bunch of hydroponic lights and set about growing some high-quality hemp.</p>
        <p>Mild complications bump the plot along. Some are farcical -- as when Grace goes to find a dealer in London, decked in an outfit inspired by either Barbara Cartland or ''American Pimp'' -- and some more serious, like the fact that Matthew's girlfriend, a local fisherwoman (Valerie Edmond), is pregnant. The movie has a gentle, silly vibe, and it would peter out in triviality if not for Ms. Blethyn's gift for finding the pain and frustration behind Grace's facade of housewifely capability.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, all the jokes exploit the same tired premise, which is the spectacle of variously dotty and stuffy Englishmen and women getting stoned, wittingly and not. A long set piece involving the two biddies who run the town convenience store, and who brew up a pot of tea from the plants they find in Grace's greenhouse, sets the tone. They giggle uncontrollably and then come down with the munchies, just like everybody else.</p>
        <p>That they're English and elderly apparently makes their antics screamingly funny to people who would turn up their noses at similar humor in a film like ''Scary Movie.'' But dopiness, as it were, transcends culture and nationality, though it is a bit annoying when it masquerades as good taste and sophistication.</p>
        <p>''Saving Grace'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some good-humored Anglo-Saxon profanity and a great deal of enthusiastic drug use.</p>
