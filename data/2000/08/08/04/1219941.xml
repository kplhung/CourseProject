        <p>Bond prices rose yesterday but ended well off their highs of the day after technology stocks recovered from an earlier slide and investors reversed a flight to quality into government securities.</p>
        <p>While sliding stock prices early in the session were the main catalyst in lifting Treasury prices, the Federal Reserve also bolstered prices by staging a coupon pass, in which the Fed buys Treasury securities and adds permanent reserves to the banking system. Yesterday the Fed bought maturities ranging from Aug. 15, 2020, through Nov. 15, 2028.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year bond, the onetime benchmark for Treasury rates, rose 11/32, to 107 9/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.74 percent from 5.76 percent on Wednesday. The closely followed 10-year note gained 5/32, to 103 31/32. Its yield dropped to 5.95 percent from 5.97 percent.</p>
        <p>The government reported yesterday that factory orders surged 5.5 percent in June, the largest increase since 7.3 percent in July 1991. The report helped to cap Treasury gains. But, excluding a record increase for aircraft and other transportation equipment, orders rose 0.3 percent.  The government also revised the gain in June durable goods orders down slightly, to 9.7 percent from the staggering 10 percent reported two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>The National Association of Purchasing Management said its July nonmanufacturing business index sank to 55.5 in July from 64 in June, while the Labor Department said jobless claims rose to a seasonally adjusted 276,000 in the week ended July 29, slightly less than forecast.</p>
        <p>Expectations are that today's July unemployment report will show little job and wage growth, providing the central bank with more information as the Federal Open Market Committee heads toward its next meeting on interest rates on Aug. 22.</p>
        <p>''The Federal Reserve is carefully perusing the continual flow of economic statistics in order to determine the best course of action at the upcoming F.O.M.C. meeting,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management. ''Using real G.D.P. as a yardstick, the year-over-year trend rate of economic growth now stands at a prodigious 6 percent, so obviously the expectation of a slowdown in the economy's pace is not a particularly heroic assumption.''</p>
        <p>''What really matters,'' he continued, ''is the extent, timing and sustainability of the slowdown, and most importantly, whether or not an impending slackening of economic growth will be enough to definitively forestall inflationary pressures in the eyes of the Fed.''</p>
        <p>In this regard, today's July labor market data will play a crucial role. Mr. Fine said that if the numbers were weak, the market would conclude that the Fed was finished raising rates, but if they were strong, the future course would be uncertain.</p>
