        <p>Japan Telecom, one of this country's largest telecommunications companies, plans to offer local phone service, which would put it into direct competition with the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, the former government phone monopoly.</p>
        <p>Japan Telecom joins a growing number of phone companies eager to offer local services in the wake of a new trade agreement with the United States that can significantly reduce the costs of doing business in a market that had long been dominated by N.T.T. DDI, Japan's second-largest telecommunications company, is also reported planning to offer local services, some time next year.</p>
        <p>Haruo Murakami, president of Japan Telecom, said at a news conference today that his company had applied to N.T.T. for the right to tap into its local network, which controls 98 percent of the lines connecting directly into homes and businesses. Depending on how quickly N.T.T. responds, Japan Telecom could offer the new service in 2001.</p>
        <p>Previously, connecting to those lines was expensive, consuming roughly 40 percent of most competitors' revenue and making local service an unprofitable business prospect for everyone but N.T.T.</p>
        <p>Under the new telecommunications agreement, those costs will be lowered by an average of 35 percent in two years and by at least 40 percent over the next three years, according to the United States trade representative's office, making it more feasible for competitors that previously limited their activities to long-distance or cellular phone services to expand into fixed-line local service.</p>
        <p>Until the agreement was signed, only the Tokyo Telecommunication Network Company offered local service in competition with N.T.T. The company, which sells three minutes of local phone service for 9 yen -- currently 8.3 cents -- has never said whether its local services were profitable, but the profitability of its business as a whole has declined since it began them.</p>
