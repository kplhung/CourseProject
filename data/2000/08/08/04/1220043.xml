        <p>3 Crosby Street, SoHo</p>
        <p>Through Aug. 31</p>
        <p>Judging from the offhand beauty of her first solo show in New York, Mari Eastman is a mixed-media artist whose heart belongs to a relatively old-fashioned form of picture-making. Ms. Eastman veers from painting to drawing to illustration and beyond, working on canvas, on paper and on the wall. She uses glitter, stencil and stain painting; she works from photographs, manages some crude embroidery and also paints on handmade clothes.</p>
        <p>Images don't always conform neatly to a single surface, but travel across several, most spectacularly in the case of a spray-painted mountain range that moves across the entire length of the gallery, figuring in most of the paintings and drawings that cross its path.</p>

        <p>Judging from the offhand beauty of her first solo show in New York, Mari Eastman is a mixed-media artist whose heart belongs to a relatively old-fashioned form of picture-making. Ms. Eastman veers from painting to drawing to illustration and beyond, working on canvas, on paper and on the wall. She uses glitter, stencil and stain painting; she works from photographs, manages some crude embroidery and also paints on handmade clothes.</p>
        <p>Images don't always conform neatly to a single surface, but travel across several, most spectacularly in the case of a spray-painted mountain range that moves across the entire length of the gallery, figuring in most of the paintings and drawings that cross its path.</p>
        <p>A result is a pictorial installation that mixes early 1980's appropriation with early 90's abject art, and has a light, improvisational touch of its own. Ms. Eastman's subjects, which range from fashion models to eagle's nests, lone wolves and Bambi-like deer, alternate nature with culture, urban with wild, but tend to conjure one kind of romance or another.</p>
        <p>A smallish drawing of a detail of a cowboy mounting up triggers a much larger extension onto the wall, and includes a syrupy monologue by a late-night radio DJ. (It's Richard Prince by way of Karen Kalimnik.) The canvas ''Deer in a Field'' includes the lyrics of a breakup song written in red beneath a coat of white paint that hides lots of other tantalizing pentimenti.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, two little nocturnes, the shimmering ''Copenhagen'' and the darker, New Yorkish ''Nighttime-Downtown'' have affinities with masters of nonchalance like Alex Katz and Tabboo.</p>
        <p>All this works, partly because nearly all of Ms. Eastman's paintings succeed as autonomous objects and mostly because she manages to make every mark count while appearing to do anything she pleases as soon as it occurs to her, no second thoughts.</p>
