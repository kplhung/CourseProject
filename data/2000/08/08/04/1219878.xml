        <p>* ''ALICE AND MARTIN,'' starring Juliet Binoche and Alexis Loret. Directed by Andre Techine (R, 123 minutes). Mr. Techine's sprawling, emotional love story is the kind of movie that makes you work a little. It takes time to figure out the relationships among the characters, to say nothing of their motives and feelings. But like so many of Mr. Techine's movies, ''Alice and Martin'' repays the effort. The unlikely, complicated passion between Martin, the troubled illegitimate son of a wealthy industrialist, and Alice, a brittle violinist, unfolds against an equally complicated and sometimes overcrowded background of family secrets and shifting domestic alliances. Ms. Binoche and Mr. Loret are superb in the title roles (A. O. Scott).</p>

        <p>* ''ALICE AND MARTIN,'' starring Juliet Binoche and Alexis Loret. Directed by Andre Techine (R, 123 minutes). Mr. Techine's sprawling, emotional love story is the kind of movie that makes you work a little. It takes time to figure out the relationships among the characters, to say nothing of their motives and feelings. But like so many of Mr. Techine's movies, ''Alice and Martin'' repays the effort. The unlikely, complicated passion between Martin, the troubled illegitimate son of a wealthy industrialist, and Alice, a brittle violinist, unfolds against an equally complicated and sometimes overcrowded background of family secrets and shifting domestic alliances. Ms. Binoche and Mr. Loret are superb in the title roles (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''BUTTERFLY,'' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano. Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes). This gentle, devastating film, based on short stories by the Spanish writer Manuel Rivas, tells the story of Moncho (Mr. Lozano), a sensitive young boy coming of age in the months before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. The movie touches on the usual excitements and mysteries of childhood, but Moncho's relationship with his teacher, the proudly Republican Don Gregorio, beautifully played by Mr. Fernan Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos and political complexity (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''CHICKEN RUN,'' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson and Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (G, 86 minutes). The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Mr. Park, who also directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Mr. Lord's continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority. ''Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ''Stalag 17'' to ''Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Mr. Gibson, the voice of Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the hens to fly. Finally it shows that the hens can save themselves through the pluck of Ginger (Ms. Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal of this. It's a great eggscape from banality (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''CHUCK AND BUCK,'' starring Chris Weitz and Mike White. Directed by Miguel Arteta (R, 95 minutes). At the center of Mr. Arteta's funny, creepy and poignant new film is Buck, a 27-year-old man who inhabits the mental world of a preadolescent boy. As played by Mr. White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive, an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend Charlie (Mr. Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed careerist. Mr. Arteta's visual sense, Mr. White's insightful script and strong supporting performances from Mr. Weitz and his brother Sam, as well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some time. ''Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore, magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this year (Scott).</p>
        <p>''DISNEY'S 'THE KID,' '' starring Bruce Willis, Spencer Breslin, Emily Mortimer, Lily Tomlin and Jean Smart. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 101 minutes). In this cloying throwback to Disney's modest live-action comedies of old, Mr. Willis plays a smarmy image consultant humanized by his encounter with his 8-year-old self (Spencer Breslin), who arrives in Los Angeles via a toy red prop plane. By rights the movie should be dreadful, and it is thick with therapeutic cliches, but it occasionally soars to heights of not bad, thanks to strong performances from Mr. Willis, Ms. Tomlin and Ms. Smart, and to Audrey Wells's surprisingly clever script (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE,'' directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (PG-13, 79 minutes). Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, the former wife of Jim Bakker, is that most American of stories, a figure of tragedy and a joke. This documentary walks us through her life, a veritable catalog of bad marriages, lost televangelist empires, squandered relationships with children and, despite it all, indomitable optimism. ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' cries out for a little more analysis of its subject. Instead, it joyfully wallows in the backdraft of her excesses. The directors are awfully quick to forgive Ms. Messner's lack of self-awareness, possibly because she has a heart as big as her hair. She was one of the first in the televangelist crowd to accept gay men with AIDS. The movie makes a case for her because she's a survivor; it's more of a mash note than a formal documentary, and there's nothing wrong with that (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''GROOVE,'' starring Hamish Linklater, Lola Glaudini, Mackenzie Firgens and Steve Van Wormer. Directed by Greg Harrison (R, 86 minutes). If you're nostalgic for chasing down a rave gig across the city and arriving to find a pair of 16-year-olds discussing the merits of drum and bass versus jungle, then this mostly knowing and funny comedy is just the film for you. Even if you're not, its seductive lack of pretension will win you over. ''Groove'' is a comedy of moments, tracking a crowd through the ups and downs of one night of pleasure at a rave. Mr. Harrison and his team don't try to pretend that raves are anything new or dangerous. Rather, they're an entrenched circuit with specific tribal complications, and this genial picture captures them (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''LOSER,'' starring Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari and Greg Kinnear. Directed by Amy Heckerling (PG-13, 93 minutes). Admirers of Ms. Heckerling's movies -- notably ''Clueless'' and ''Fast Times at Ridgmont High'' -- may be disappointed in her latest effort, a romantic comedy about two college students who overcome the snobbery and cruelty of their surroundings to find true love. The script could have used a few more drafts and a less perfunctory climax, but Ms. Heckerling's characteristic wit and intelligence are still in evidence. Fine performances by Mr. Biggs as the title character, Ms. Suvari as the girl of his dreams and Mr. Kinnear as a sleazy literature professor help make ''Loser'' more enjoyable than most recent youth-targeted date movies (Scott).</p>
        <p>''ME, MYSELF AND IRENE,'' starring Jim Carrey, Renee Zellweger and Robert Forster. Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly (R, 100 minutes). If ''There's Something About Mary'' offended you with its callous mockery of hair and pet care and its whimsical views of stalking and serial killing, then this latest festival of vulgarity from the Farrelly brothers will make you miserable. But ''Me, Myself and Irene'' shares with their earlier movies a kind of dopey boyish sincerity and a good-natured sympathy for the underdog that may prove capable of winning over even the dourest spirits. Mr. Carrey, in one -- or is it two? -- of his most charming and repellent performances, plays a Rhode Island state trooper with a split personality and a giant crush on Irene, played with winning moxie and plausible bewilderment by Ms. Zellweger (Scott).</p>
        <p>''NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS,'' starring Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson. Directed by Peter Segal (PG-13, 105 minutes). In this sequel, Mr. Murphy again displays enough agility to show that he deserves to be taken seriously. Parts of the film, a variation on the Jekyll and Hyde story, are tremendously funny. Every single scene in which Mr. Murphy, hidden away under millions of dollars' worth of transformative makeup, plays all the members of the Klump family -- all of them together in some scenes -- will knock the blues right out of you. But some of the cheap laughs to which the picture stoops will give you the blues. This makes ''Nutty Professor II'' half a movie at best. The broad humor  at times derails Mr. Murphy's performances,  but the film provides a vehicle for him to display his reach (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE PATRIOT,'' starring Mel Gibson and Chris Cooper. Directed by Roland Emmerich (R, 158 minutes). A grueling Revolutionary War epic that, at more than two and a half hours, seems to take place in real time. The brutality and sentimentality are effective, though the film will leave you feeling used as you exit the theater. This sort-of prequel to Mr. Emmerich's ''Independence Day'' stars Mr. Gibson as a gentle farmer who leads the Colonies in wresting freedom from the Brits, using counterintuitive methods alarmingly similar to terrorism. His anguished masculinity is brandished like a musket. The film's chief asset is his relationship with the young actors playing his children; it draws on the actor's real-life feeling about his own large brood, and his work with them is stirring (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE PERFECT STORM,'' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, John C. Reilly and Diane Lane. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (PG-13, 130 minutes). Impressive but monotonously redundant special effects smother the human drama in this true story (adapted from Sebastian Junger's best-selling book) of a group of swordfishermen battling ''the storm of the century'' off Massachusetts in 1991. Mr. Clooney is the ship's glowering, enigmatic captain, and Mr. Wahlberg and Ms. Lane are the appealing lovebirds who lend the movie its stingy quotient of warmth. The early scenes, which paint a romantic portrait of the fisherman's life in Gloucester, Mass., promise a great deal, but the movie becomes waterlogged once it leaves shore (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>''SCARY MOVIE,'' starring Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra and Shannon Elizabeth. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (R, 88 minutes). Mr. Wayans's latest genre-film spoof doesn't so much lampoon the ''Scream'' movies as offer the latest remake, this time as gross-out comedy. ''Scary Movie'' abounds in crude, often stale jokes involving male genitals, female pubic hair, flatulence and dismemberment. There are a few hilarious moments, and some that will provoke guilty laughter, but Mr. Wayans hasn't quite figured out how to parody movies -- like the wildly popular ''Scream'' series -- that already parody themselves (Scott).</p>
        <p>''SUNSHINE,'' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle, Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180 minutes). In Mr. Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history, Mr. Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family -- grandfather, father and son -- who endure the corruption of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the viciousness of Fascism and the brutality of Communism. Mr. Fiennes's performances and those of Ms. Ehle and Ms. Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life) help save the film from melodramatic excess. Even though much of the story is crudely told, ''Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated and painful historical experiences (Scott).</p>
        <p>''WHAT LIES BENEATH,'' starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (PG-13, 130 minutes). Mr. Zemeckis's film takes its time in laying out the story of high-strung Claire (Ms. Pfeiffer), who is dissolving into hysteria on a regular basis. Her daughter has just gone off to college, and Claire is still recovering from the trauma of a car accident. Then her house starts showing signs of being haunted. Her husband, Norman (Mr. Ford), is a driven research scientist with a secret. This thriller is as implausibly chilling as any ''X Files'' episode. By the last 10 minutes, your interest will have long vanished (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''THE WIND WILL CARRY US,'' starring Behzad Dourani. Directed by Abbas Kiarostami (not rated, 118 minutes). The latest film by the Iranian director -- widely considered one of the greatest living filmmakers -- is oblique, evocative and visually stunning. Mr. Kiarostami's views of hillsides, valleys and gnarled, solitary trees seem almost otherworldly in their clarity and depth, and his story, about a morose engineer who has come to a remote Kurdish village on an enigmatic mission, is as simple and mysterious as a folk tale. This is one of those rare movies that completely absorb your attention -- and demand your concentration -- while you're watching, and that stay in your thoughts, growing richer and more powerful, for a long time afterward (Scott).</p>
        <p>''X-MEN,'' starring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin. Directed by Bryan Singer (PG-13, 105 minutes). The long-awaited arrival of Marvel Comics' do-gooder mutants is mildly fun on a couple of levels: for one, the acting duel between Mr. Stewart (as the mutant telepath Professor X, the X-Men's leader) and Ian McKellen (as the mutant nemesis Magneto, who possesses the power of supermagnetism). As these two austere hams trill their vowels at each other you get the feeling you really are watching members of another species in action. And Mr. Jackman scores as the two-fisted, confrontational Wolverine, a mutant with superstrength, an ability to heal all wounds and metal-alloy claws that shoot out from his knuckles. He lives to fight, a boisterous tragic hero with no complications. Otherwise the movie is an earnest affair that is clumsy when it should be light on its feet; it takes itself even more seriously than the comic book does, though its fans may be overjoyed by that devotion (Mitchell).</p>
