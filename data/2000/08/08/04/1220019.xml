        <p>American Express and the Ventro Corporation announced that they would start an e-marketplace for business-to-business transactions. The joint venture, MarketMile, will promote online buying of products and services, a market that the two companies estimate at more than $1.4 trillion and one that is rapidly moving to the Internet. Since 1997, American Express, which will own 65 percent of the new company, has invested in an array of Internet start-ups, but MarketMile is the company's first standalone e-commerce start-up.</p>
