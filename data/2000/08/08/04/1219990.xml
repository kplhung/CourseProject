        <p>Jets Coach Al Groh all but held up an enormous stop sign this week. Stop, he nearly implored, making so much of the impressive debuts of the 2000 class of rookies.</p>
        <p>After all, the Jets had beaten the New Orleans Saints. The pass rush that sacked Saints quarterbacks five times? Do not get your hopes up for a repeat this week.</p>
        <p>If the rookies sent hopes racing after only one game, then Groh was determined to keep his foot firmly on the brake.</p>
        <p>When the Jets face the Packers Friday night, they will get a far truer measure of their progress than they did in their 24-20 victory over the Saints. The Jets will also get -- for at least a few series at least -- a glimpse of the team and the atmosphere they will face for the season opener Sept. 3 at Green Bay.</p>
        <p>Lambeau Field has been sold out since 1960, and last week, the Packers drew about 50,000 fans for a scrimmage.</p>
        <p>''We're dealing with a much stronger opponent than last week and a hostile environment,'' Groh said. ''This is a very good place to play a preseason game because it's one of the few places in the National Football League where the preseason environment comes close to the in season.''</p>
        <p>Still, Groh will not use this game to measure the Jets against the Packers so much as he will view it as Phase 2 of the Jets' self-evaluation. Groh has shaken up the rotation at several positions to get a better look at the competition at some positions.</p>
        <p>The rookie tight end Anthony Becht, who played well against the Saints, is likely to start. Groh did his best to tamp down a bit of the excitement generated by Becht's game, in which he caught a touchdown pass, made a spectacular catch on the sideline and bulldozed an unsuspecting cornerback after a third reception.</p>
        <p>''It's a pretty good break-in for a rookie player but he's got a bit to go,'' Groh said of Becht. ''He's not N.F.L. ready.''</p>
        <p>The team is also playing down the excitement about its pass rush.</p>
        <p>''They showed some flashes, but they went against a lot of second-teamers,'' safety Victor Green said of the pass rush. ''If they can pass rush like that all season, we'll have a great defense. I don't think you can game plan for that Favre. You've just got to put pressure on that guy. If you don't, he can eat you alive.''</p>
        <p>Defensive end Shaun Ellis has taken snaps with the first unit, and both he and linebacker John Abraham had sacks against New Orleans. But this game will be something else. Brett Favre has perfected the art of the short drop and quick pass.</p>
        <p>Last season, Green Bay allowed 36 sacks, fifth best in the National Football Conference. (New Orleans quarterbacks were sacked 41 times.) As a result, Groh will look less for sacks Friday than for the technique and pressure the rushers bring.</p>
        <p>''Favre is very quick away from the center and his identification of what he's looking for is very quick, so it's gone,'' Groh said.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of circumstances when you scrutinize the rush. There's a guy who, had it been a prolonged drop, is going to come free. But he never gets free enough to do damage because it's gone. So you might say Jack got no sacks in the game; he took a step back. But that's the nature of the system.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>VINNY TESTAVERDE will start, but AL GROH would not say Wednesday what his quarterback rotation would look like after that. Groh wasn't forthcoming about injuries either, although he did say that cornerback RAY MICKENS (hamstring) and linebacker MO LEWIS (strained muscle behind knee) would play. . . . Packers quarterback BRETT FAVRE has been intermittently plagued by tendinitis in his right elbow and blisters on his fingers, but he will play Friday -- albeit only for a few series.</p>
