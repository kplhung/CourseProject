        <p>A Manhattan development company is hoping to repeat the success it had in an office-to-rental conversion in the financial district with 88 Greenwich Street, an Art Deco former office tower built in 1929 that is being turned into 458 apartments that opened for leasing last month.</p>
        <p>One-third of the studio to two-bedroom apartments, with 539 to 1,138 square feet of space, have been leased at the 38-story building. Monthly rents range from $1,875 to $5,500, according to the World-Wide Group, the developer. Rents on some units have been raised by an average of 5 percent since leasing began.</p>

        <p>A Manhattan development company is hoping to repeat the success it had in an office-to-rental conversion in the financial district with 88 Greenwich Street, an Art Deco former office tower built in 1929 that is being turned into 458 apartments that opened for leasing last month.</p>
        <p>One-third of the studio to two-bedroom apartments, with 539 to 1,138 square feet of space, have been leased at the 38-story building. Monthly rents range from $1,875 to $5,500, according to the World-Wide Group, the developer. Rents on some units have been raised by an average of 5 percent since leasing began.</p>
        <p>As part of the conversion, the company will restore the building's facade and lobby to their original design. The $100 million project is to be completed by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>World-Wide's first conversion in the neighborhood was at 71 Broadway, which it bought in 1996 and has since carved into 238 rentals. Now, it also is planning to convert 110 and 120 Church Street and 53 Park Place into 550 apartments.</p>
        <p>Discussing his company's interest in the neighborhood, David Lowenfeld, executive vice president at World-Wide, said that initially the area was ''a field of dreams, but now there's a critical mass.'' Though the area is still emerging as a residential community, ''the biggest endorsement is that people are moving from other buildings and staying here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The conversion of 88 Greenwich Street is the latest in the financial district since city tax incentives led to the conversion of more old office buildings into housing in 1995. But the pace of such conversions is less frenetic than in recent years, real estate professionals said.</p>
        <p>With the city's resurgent office market, they said, some developers decided to keep their buildings for commercial use. Also, fewer buildings suitable for conversion are available.</p>
        <p>To date, 4,440 residences have been created and 1,182 more are in various stages of development, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business group. The area is home to 25,000 people, up from 15,000 in 1995.</p>
        <p>Carl Weisbrod, president of the alliance, said that as many as 10 buildings once scheduled for housing were being retained as offices. Speaking of the addition of new apartments, he said: ''We would have been far ahead of our projection of 7,000 units by 2002, but for the strength of the office market. But we're still on schedule.''</p>
        <p>The area also is expected to have more time to prove itself as a residential neighborhood, because the legislation extending tax incentives for the conversions for five years, to 2007, has passed both houses of the State Legislature. Mr. Weisbrod said Gov. George E. Pataki was expected to sign the legislation soon.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, some progress has been made to change the perception that the neighborhood lacks services. In recent months, two grocery stores joined the 7,500-square-foot Amish market at Cedar and Washington Streets, which developers helped subsidize. They are the 11,526-square-foot Jubilee Market, at 99 John Street, and the 3,000-square-foot grocery that is part of the Vine restaurant at 25 Broad Street. Also, a 16-screen movie theater recently opened at Battery Park City.</p>
        <p>The downtown rental market remains strong. Over the last year, there has been little tenant turnover, and rents that went into effect with new leases increased by 12 percent, said Douglas Wagner, president of Benjamin James Associates, a Manhattan residential brokerage. His firm put the average monthly rent for a typical 600-square-foot studio at $2,225, and $2,800 for a one-bedroom apartment with 722 to 825 square feet.</p>
        <p>World-Wide first got involved with 88 Greenwich Street in 1997, when it joined with the owner, the Graystone Group, to convert the building to housing. But Graystone decided instead to sell the building to another developer whose plan to turn it into condominiums was scotched because of lack of financing.</p>
        <p>Last year, World-Wide bought the building, then one-third occupied by office users, and proceeded alone. All but one of the commercial tenants has been relocated. The Department of Motor Vehicles will occupy the second floor for at least four more years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lowenfeld said the building's location west of Broadway put it ''away from the hustle and bustle.'' It is also close to three subway stops, making the target audience those people who want easy commuting to work, he added.</p>
        <p>That appealed to Elizabeth Bragdon. With time running short on the studio she is subletting on the Upper West Side, the 26-year-old account supervisor at a public relations firm signed on for a third-floor, 739-square-foot one-bedroom apartment at 88 Greenwich Street that she will share with a roommate for $2,325 a month. Her firm soon will move to TriBeCa and she intends to make the 15-minute walk to her job.</p>
        <p>More important, she said: ''This apartment was the most affordable. And I even get a concierge.''</p>
        <p>Among the other amenities planned at the building are a 4,000-square-foot health club and a 2,000-square-foot lounge on the 24th floor that leads to a sun deck.</p>
        <p>Under the conversion, designed by the Manhattan firm of Schuman Lichtenstein Claman &amp; Efron, there will be 100 different apartment layouts. All the units have ceilings that average 10 feet high and large windows, and some have terraces or Hudson River views. Occupancy is to start by the end of this month.</p>
