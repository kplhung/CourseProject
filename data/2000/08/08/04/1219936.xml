        <p>Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, said today that the island should begin considering new fighter aircraft purchases, warning that in five years China could threaten Taiwan's ability to control the skies over the Taiwan Strait, a key factor in repelling a mainland invasion.</p>
        <p>That Mr. Chen, who spoke during an inspection of Taiwan's air force headquarters in Taipei, would make the politically charged suggestion during the Republican Party's convention suggested to some analysts that he hoped to interject the issue into the American presidential campaign. The United States is the most likely supplier of any advanced fighter jets to Taiwan. But such a sale would be hotly contested by Beijing, which regards the island as a province separated from the mainland by civil war.</p>
        <p>''Chen may be trying to smoke out the United States and have some sort of bidding war on reassurances from both candidates,'' said Jonathan Pollack, a China specialist at the Rand Corporation in California.</p>
        <p>Support for Taiwan is always an emotional issue in the United States, but this year it became particularly so with Mr. Chen's election, which drew threats of war from Beijing. China distrusts Mr. Chen because of his past support for Taiwan's formal independence from the mainland.</p>
        <p>In the midst of the 1992 presidential campaign, President Bush decided to sell Taiwan 150 advanced F-16 fighter aircraft after it became clear that China had bought advanced Sukhoi-27 fighters from Russia. The F-16 sale, the last major American arms sale to Taiwan, infuriated Beijing and complicated already difficult relations between the United States and China.</p>
        <p>Under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the United States is obligated to help Taiwan maintain its defenses. But in a 1982 joint communique with Beijing, Washington pledged not to increase the quantity or quality of arms sold to Taiwan.</p>
        <p>More recently, though, China has ordered as many as 40 advanced Sukhoi-30 fighters from Russia as part of a steadily growing arms procurement program intended to give China an edge over Taiwan.</p>
        <p>One military official here said this week that air force personnel have been told to expect the first of the planes to arrive in China later this year. The Sukhoi-30 is capable of carrying air-to-surface guided anti-ship missiles and has a longer range than the Sukhoi-27.</p>
        <p>China has already fielded 48 of the Sukhoi-27 fighters at bases around the country and first deployed them over the Taiwan Strait during war games last year. It has plans to assemble as many as 200 more with help from Russia.</p>
        <p>Bates Gill, a military expert at the Brookings Institution, said it is natural that the reports of Sukhoi-30 purchases from Russia should inspire Taiwan's air force to look for a next generation aircraft itself.</p>
        <p>''Given the aging of the F-16 and the lead times needed to get next-generation aircraft in fighting shape, these decisions need to be made within the next three to five years at the latest,'' said Mr. Gill.</p>
        <p>Other analysts said Mr. Chen may simply be raising the issue generally to put the next American administration on notice that the shopping list will be longer than usual when the island makes its annual arms purchase requests in the spring.</p>
        <p>For the time being, Taiwan enjoys clear air superiority over the 100-mile-wide body of water separating the island from the mainland, thanks to its F-16's and 60 French-made Mirage 2000-5 fighters.</p>
        <p>While China has the largest air force in the world with about 6,000 planes, nearly half of those date from the 1950's and only a few dozen of the rest are viable machines for modern warfare. Even with its Russian purchases, military analysts say China is a long way from dominating the skies over Taiwan because few of its pilots have received aggressive training in the advanced fighter aircraft. China is believed to have lost several Sukhoi-27 jets in training exercises already and Beijing is reluctant to push harder training for fear of losing more of the expensive planes.</p>
        <p>The country also lacks the sophisticated battlefield command technology necessary to deploy its jets effectively. It had hoped to meet that need with help from Israel, which agreed to sell China a Phalcon advanced-warning and air-control system mounted atop a Russian jet. Israel canceled that sale last month in response to American pressure.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Chen warned that Taiwan must not be complacent and should start planning for the next generation of fighters. He said Taiwan should look into fighters for 2010 to 2020 and upgrade its weapons systems. China's modernization drive will ''dramatically boost the Communist Chinese Air Force's overall air combat capability, seriously affecting the military balance'' after 2005, Mr. Chen said today.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon evidently concurs. It told Congress in its annual report on the Chinese military this June that ''if projected trends continue, the balance of air power across the Taiwan Strait could begin to shift in China's favor'' after 2005, unless Taiwan enhances its air power.</p>
