        <p>Alaska Airlines decided late Thursday night to ground 18 of its 34 MD-80 aircraft, the same model as the plane that crashed off the California coast in January when a part in the tail broke.</p>
        <p>The airline's decision followed its discovery that a measurement tool that it makes to check wear in the tail mechanism was producing inconsistent readings and that as a result, parts might be unacceptably worn.</p>
        <p>The tool is used in hangar tests to immobilize the horizontal stabilizer, the movable horizontal portion of the tail that pilots use to point the nose of the plane up or down. While the stabilizer is immobilized, a second tool pushes on the control mechanism, called a jack screw, to check for movement, which indicates wear.</p>
        <p>Failure of the jack screw is suspected in the January crash, which killed 88 people. When that airplane had its last major overhaul, the previous year, one test showed that its jack-screw wear was at the limit allowed by the manufacturer, the Boeing Company, and a mechanic called for its replacement. But the airline retested the part and concluded that it was within acceptable tolerances.</p>
        <p>Now it appears that measurements of the part can be inconsistent.</p>
        <p>Jack Evans, a spokesman for the airline, said on Thursday night that it had several ''horizontal stabilizer restraining fixtures'' that it could use for the test, some made by Boeing and some that the airline produced itself.</p>
        <p>In recent side-by-side tests, Alaska discovered that measurements made with the Boeing restraining fixture showed the same amount of wear on the tail part no matter how the Boeing fixture was positioned; measurements made using Alaska's own restraining fixture varied, according to how that fixture was positioned.</p>
        <p>Therefore, Mr. Evans said, the airline is not certain that planes in service that were tested with the tool the airline made itself have wear that is within acceptable limits.</p>
        <p>The airline quickly determined that 16 of its MD-80's in service had been tested with the Boeing fixtures, but the status of an additional 18 is uncertain, he said.</p>
        <p>''We put these planes on the ground at 8 p.m., Pacific time,'' he said. ''We thought it was a good idea.''</p>
        <p>At the Federal Aviation Administration, Eliot Brenner, a spokesman, said, ''Alaska Airlines has done the right thing by deciding to double-check the jack-screw tolerances of the remainder of its MD-80's.''</p>
        <p>He said that the F.A.A. was asking other airlines that fly the MD-80, and the DC-9, a similar airplane, to check their own tools.</p>
        <p>''There are no indications of other problems, but in the interests of safety, the F.A.A. will direct that other carriers move quickly to make certain that is the case,'' he said.</p>
