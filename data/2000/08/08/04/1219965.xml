        <p>A seven-alarm fire gutted a Roman Catholic church here today, leaving two firefighters with minor injuries and about 3,000 families without a house of worship.</p>
        <p>The blaze started about 11:15 a.m. inside St. Edward the Confessor Roman Catholic Church when a power cord attached to electric prayer candles malfunctioned, fire officials said. A rug caught fire, and then the flames jumped to the curtains and swept over the wooden altar, said Chief Nick Favata of the Syosset Fire Department. Chief Favata said the church's 35-foot steeple created ''a chimney-like effect,'' feeding oxygen to the flames, which devoured the sanctuary, destroying everything but the pews.</p>

        <p>A seven-alarm fire gutted a Roman Catholic church here today, leaving two firefighters with minor injuries and about 3,000 families without a house of worship.</p>
        <p>The blaze started about 11:15 a.m. inside St. Edward the Confessor Roman Catholic Church when a power cord attached to electric prayer candles malfunctioned, fire officials said. A rug caught fire, and then the flames jumped to the curtains and swept over the wooden altar, said Chief Nick Favata of the Syosset Fire Department. Chief Favata said the church's 35-foot steeple created ''a chimney-like effect,'' feeding oxygen to the flames, which devoured the sanctuary, destroying everything but the pews.</p>
        <p>Flames and smoke could be seen from half a mile away, witnesses said, before the fire was brought under control about noon. Roughly 250 firefighters were called in to help. One fireman, Stephen Morris, was treated for heat exhaustion at North Shore University Hospital and later released, fire officials said. Another firefighter, William Magrino, was treated on the scene for heat exhaustion.</p>
        <p>When the fire broke out, the Rev. Joseph McComiskey and his staff of four were in the rectory, church officials said. Construction workers, who were working on the parish's elementary school, noticed flames coming from the steeple and alerted the priest and his staff. They all escaped unharmed.</p>
        <p>Firefighters were able to save the cross from the steeple and the tabernacle, which contained the gold chalices used for communion.</p>
        <p>''The entire main altar is destroyed,'' said Nunzio Cazzetta, a trustee at St. Edward's. ''The entire church is destroyed. The glass is all blown out.''</p>
        <p>The church of St. Edward the Confessor, built in 1952, is the only Roman Catholic church in the Village of Syosset. Staff members and parishioners fought back tears as firefighters knocked out the remnants of broken windows.</p>
        <p>''I tell you, I started to cry,'' said Mr. Cazzetta, who has been a parishioner here for 37 years. ''Our son, who was 11 years old, was buried from this church. My daughter was married here. Our grandchildren -- her children -- were all baptized in this church. It's like watching your own house burn down.''</p>
        <p>Barbara Sica, a member of St. Edward's for the last 35 years -- even after she moved to Manhattan -- had been visiting friends in the area when she heard the news of the fire. She drove to the church and stared at the ruined steeple. ''Even if they rebuild it, it's a different building,'' said Ms. Sica, who noted that her two daughters were christened, confirmed and married there. ''I can't help but being a little teary-eyed to see it. It's a part of my life.''</p>
        <p>Church officials said that they were discussing plans to rebuild, but that no final decision had been made. Local synagogues and churches have offered their sanctuaries for services. This weekend's services will be held at Our Lady of Mercy Academy in Syosset.</p>
