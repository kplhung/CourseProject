        <p>It is summer in New York, this year a season that jumps from muggy heat to damp chill without warning. There is relatively little dance in pleasantly climate-controlled theaters. So what do those mad creatures called dancers do?</p>
        <p>Forget about vacations or more trips to the office-temp center. Dancers dance. So they are taking to the city's parks, rooftops, gardens and empty buildings over the next four weeks in a surge of activity that truly offers something for just about everyone. Festivals and special events are everywhere, and many of them are free.</p>
        <p>The granddaddy of summer series is the free 30-year-old Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival, which opens tomorrow and runs through Aug. 27. This year's theme is ''Celebrate Good Times.'' Does this mean there will be nonstop partying spilling out across the plazas and into the band shell at Lincoln Center for the month? Jenneth Webster, the festival's irrepressible director, admits she did contemplate ''Let the Good Times Rule'' for this year's title.</p>
        <p>Good times, Ms. Webster said, are ''like the moment you're in, if it's a good moment. Everything from meditation to a conga line. So there's a whole spiritual slant to this festival.''</p>
        <p>The first artists to approach her about appearing in the festival this summer were the Drepung Loseling Monks of Tibet, who will perform chants and dances on Aug. 17 in ''Sacred Arts of Tibet.'' Ms. Webster built a week of mystical arts around them, with Ali Akbar Khan, the virtuoso sitar player on Aug. 13 at 8 p.m., and ''Pauline Oliveros's Deep Listening For-Tunes,'' a celebration of the mystical composer's 50th year in music, on Aug. 17 at 2 p.m.</p>
        <p>Ms. Oliveros's music is well known to audiences for avant-garde dance,  and Mr. Khan's concert promises to be a kind of performance event, given that Ms. Webster will build a tent and provide a rug for the musicians.  Purists will be heartened to know that Donald Byrd and his high-energy company, the Group, will be on hand that week to shake things up, to music by Duke Ellington performed by David Berger and the Sultans of Swing (Aug. 15 and 16).</p>
        <p>The festival's dance events begin tomorrow afternoon with an international family dance party featuring Estampas y Tradiciones of Mexico, Korean Masked Dancing and Reginald Yates's Bantaba of Africa. And that conga line may get going, at least impromptu-style, with ''Encuentros Dominicanos'' on Sunday afternoon. There will also be performances by established modern-dance troupes like the Parsons Dance Company (Tuesday ) and the Paul Taylor Dance Company, whose program will include ''Cascade'' (next Friday and Aug. 12).</p>
        <p>The festival is also a good place to see newer artists. Two promising programs this year are ''Subtle Changes: Speaking the Truth,'' an afternoon of choreography by Hope Boykin, Ayodele Casel, Kerri Edge, Cheryl Godineaux, Jamie Philbert and Laila Sales (Wednesday ) and a performance by the Pascal Rioult Dance Theater (Aug. 22).</p>
        <p>Is the experience of performing outdoors at all different from dancing inside the three walls of a traditional proscenium stage? Edward Morgan, a charismatic performer whose love for ballet finds expression in his small company's joyous classicism, once performed in the ultimate outdoor theater space, the  amphitheater in Athens while on tour with the Joffrey Ballet. And the MorganScott Ballet, founded in 1997 with Daniel Scott, has had its share of competing with urban distractions in outdoor performances in New York City.</p>
        <p>For their performance next Friday at ''Bryant Park Presents August Dance,'' Mr. Morgan and Mr. Scott have taken into account not only the expressiveness of their performers and the need to slightly rechoreograph for a stage without wing space but also the angle of the audience from the stage. They pick dancers with the extra personality or natural projection for outdoor performances and tailor the program for the casual observer. ''We normally start with classical work and then go into something more contemporary,'' Mr. Morgan said. ''But outdoors, if you start with something a little more contemporary, you may be able to draw the audience into the classical piece that comes next.''</p>
        <p>The same philosophy appears to govern the dizzyingly wide-ranging free new Bryant Park series, developed by Ethan Lercher of the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, who operates on the principle that the more dance the better for New York City. The series opens tonight with Nick Palumbo and the Flipped Fedoras and Dancers, a group of swing musicians and dancers who encourage the audience to join in, and continues on successive Fridays with modern dance by Nicholas Leichter (Aug. 18) and Hernando Cortez (Aug. 25).</p>
        <p>Despina Stamos, the producer and curator of the free ''Deli Dances in Times Square'' festival, chose five advisers known for their engagingly  oddball creativity in downtown dance and performance art. ''They do interesting work for people who don't see a lot of dance,'' Ms. Stamos said. ''We wanted to show that dance is colorful, bold and hopefully accessible.''</p>
        <p>The festival, which begins formally at 12:30 this afternoon, will present more than 40 individuals and groups in afternoon and evening performances through Aug. 18 at 135 West 42nd Street. The sponsoring organization is Chasama, which puts on performances in empty buildings managed by the Durst Organization. (The series got its name from the former delicatessen where it was held last year.)</p>
        <p>''Deli Dances'' aims for an audience new to dance. Ms. Stamos hopes that tourists and shoppers at the big theme stores in the neighborhood may wander into this ''no budget'' event, as she puts it. ''This is also an opportunity for choreographers to show their work in an area they normally don't,'' Ms. Stamos said. To whet audience appetites, a sample of dances was performed earlier in the week in a Times Square subway station. There will also be ''open stage'' nights on Tuesdays when anyone can sign up to perform.</p>
        <p>Six other far-flung festivals will present dance throughout the city. Dancers and musicians from the Djoniba School will perform on Wednesday in Summer in the Square 2000, a festival in Union Square that runs through Aug. 30. Other dance events include a program by performers from the Martha Graham Dance Company in works they or guests have choreographed, on Aug. 16.</p>
        <p>Central Park SummerStage and Celebrate Brooklyn! will go out on a limb with dance that is exciting and good-looking but also demands fully committed attention. The hard-driving, gutsy O Vertigo Danse from Canada will share the bill with the quietly thought-provoking Gina Gibney Dance from New York in Central Park next Friday.</p>
        <p>Down in Prospect Park on Aug. 12, Celebrate Brooklyn! will stage work by Hope Clark and Sarah East Johnson, the two choreographers this year in the festival's forward-looking residency program. The piece by Ms. Clark will blend voice, video, aerial movement and digital effects. Ms. Johnson's all-female company draws on acrobatic feats, trapeze work and even wrestling for what has been described as a mix of circus and dance. Mr. Byrd and his company follow on Aug. 18.</p>
        <p>''Swing Week,'' designated by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani from Aug. 14 to 20, will spill out through Manhattan, the Bronx, Hoboken, N.J., and on the Internet. This celebration of swing, a dance developed in the 1920's at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, has been organized by the producers of the Broadway musical ''Swing!'' But Marc Routh, one of those producers, makes a believable case for the festival's having as much to do with the sheer joy of swing dancing as with the show.</p>
        <p>''I think the dance in its simplest form has to do with that wonderful tangible thing of holding on to a partner and trusting another person,'' Mr. Routh said. Most swing dancers do not progress to the kind of complicated, airborne feats that the cast performs. But essentially swing is an uncomplicated matter of ''right, left, back step,'' he said. ''It's a lot of fun and offers the opportunity to hold another human being real close and laugh and enjoy yourself.''</p>
        <p>The events, some of them free, include demonstrations, lessons and performances, four of them outdoors in the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, in Bryant Park, at Orchard Beach and in Central Park. Archival videos will be shown on Aug. 16 in a salute to 75 years of swing at the Sandra Cameron Dance Center in Manhattan. There will also be six swing-club contests, with finalists competing on the stage of the St. James Theater during a ''Swing!'' intermission.</p>
        <p>Dance will also be performed this month at the Hudson River Festival and the 19th Annual Downtown Dance Festival, which opens on Aug. 27 with the exuberant foot-stompers known as the Vanaver Caravan.</p>
        <p>What should audiences get out of all this? ''What we always hope,'' Ms. Webster said, ''is that the audience will come and leave with a tolerance for the new and unexpected.''</p>
