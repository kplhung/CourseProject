        <p>Maine certainly fired the first shot. Under a law passed in May, it became the first state to threaten the pharmaceutical industry with price controls on prescription drugs, and it created a program to negotiate lower prices for about half its residents.</p>

SmithKline Beecham, the drug manufacturer, said today that concerns about the new law's potential effects were prompting it to shift its supply routes and that it would now ship its drugs directly only to wholesalers based in other states.</p>

        <p>Maine certainly fired the first shot. Under a law passed in May, it became the first state to threaten the pharmaceutical industry with price controls on prescription drugs, and it created a program to negotiate lower prices for about half its residents.</p>
        <p>But now, it appears, the pharmaceutical industry is beginning to fire back. SmithKline Beecham, the drug manufacturer, said today that concerns about the new law's potential effects were prompting it to shift its supply routes and that it would now ship its drugs directly only to wholesalers based in other states.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for SmithKline, Thomas Johnson, said that because the company already supplied Maine through ''multiple wholesalers,'' some in-state and some out-of-state, the shift in wholesalers would affect neither the availability nor the price of the company's drugs in Maine. Among its best-known products are Augmentin, an antibiotic; Paxil, for mood disorders; and Avandia, for diabetes.</p>
        <p>But Maine's commissioner of human services, Kevin W. Concannon, said SmithKline's decision could cause prices to rise for consumers in Maine because reshipping the drugs from other states would cost more, though he did not foresee any effect on availability.</p>
        <p>''On behalf of the people of Maine,'' he said in a statement, ''I am angered at today's actions by SmithKline Beecham because it looks like a purposeful attempt to avoid Maine law, and I intend to continue to put into place all the elements necessary to achieve lower prices for Maine people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson of SmithKline described the shift in supply as ''a business decision driven by the fact that this was a vague law and difficult to interpret.''</p>
        <p>He said he had no figures on the volume of sales that would be shifted or on the company's sales volume in Maine. He also said he did not know the names of the wholesalers affected.</p>
        <p>Asked about the anger Mr. Concannon expressed, Mr. Johnson said: ''Our intent is really not to punish anyone. We're just taking measures to make sure our products remain available as always while we have a chance to understand the implications of the law.''</p>
        <p>When Maine was still considering its drug-pricing law, pharmaceutical industry lobbyists had warned that price controls could chill research efforts, discourage the state's fledgling biotechnology industry and hinder Mainers' access to drugs.</p>
        <p>But SmithKline's decision appears to be the first concrete response from a drug company to the new law, which will take effect in January.</p>
        <p>''Many threats were made by the pharmaceutical industry as the Legislature deliberated on this issue,'' said Chellie Pingree, the Democratic majority leader of the state Senate, ''and now the citizens of Maine will see the results of a business putting profits before the health and welfare of our citizens.''</p>
        <p>Other legislatures, particularly those in New England, are considering laws similar to Maine's and are watching the situation closely.</p>
        <p>Top lawmakers and officials from the Northeastern states have been meeting regularly to plot strategies on banding together to bring down prices by various methods, including  laws like Maine's, the creation of regional drug-buying pools.</p>
        <p>The law created a program, Maine Rx, which is designed to negotiate lower drug prices for the 325,000 residents whose prescriptions are not covered by insurance, along with 200,000 people in Medicaid and in drug programs for the elderly. The state has a total population of 1.2 million.</p>
        <p>The law also created $100,000 ''profiteering'' penalties for manufacturers or distributors caught overcharging or restricting drug supplies. And if, by January 2003, drug prices have not dropped considerably, then the law allows the state to impose price controls the next July.</p>
