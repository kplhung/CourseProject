        <p>Ali Salem recently wrote the script for an unfinished 10-minute public service announcement that encourages his fellow Egyptians to shed their cynicism and vote in elections.</p>
        <p>The state now says that makes him a criminal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salem, a big, rumpled, chain-smoking, 64-year-old satirist who has 25 plays and 15 books to his name, was charged July 22 with threatening national security and harming the national interest. After handing over his identity card and being released, he still could not believe it. ''It's the first time I've ever heard my name used in this way,'' Mr. Salem said, sipping strong coffee in the hotel cafe where he holds court with his artist and actor friends each day. ''Not the Egyptian Ali Salem, not the playwright Ali Salem, not the columnist Ali Salem. But the accused Ali Salem.''</p>
        <p>In a country that has criminalized many forms of political criticism and debate, that sobriquet puts him in the company of Islamic militants, journalists, union officials, human rights activists and academics who have offended the status quo.</p>
        <p>Egypt boasts of having a Constitution and democratic accouterments like courts, elections, a lively private business sector and a Parliament. Even its internal critics acknowledge that it is freer -- and more mindful of its own laws -- than most of its neighbors in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>But in the last five years, the government of President Hosni Mubarak has also frozen the funds of nearly every professional union and trade organization in the country. It has rejected all petitions for new political parties. It has ignored appeals to end the 19-year state of emergency, which permits the authorities to restrict political activity and send adversaries to jail with no right of appeal.</p>
        <p>Since President Mubarak won re-election in a yes-or-no referendum last fall with more than 94 percent of the vote, his government has stepped up its campaign. It jailed rights activists last winter when their reports on Muslim-Christian violence were deemed to threaten national security, and it has continued to jail writers when their articles are found insulting to Egyptian institutions.</p>
        <p>In June, it closed a research institute, the Ibn Khaldoun Center, which was producing Mr. Salem's get-out-the-vote film as well as a conference on minority rights in the region.</p>
        <p>Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a sociologist who directed the center and holds an American passport, has been held without charge in Tora Prison outside of Cairo since June 30. His detention has spurred protests from human rights groups around the world as well as the Middle East Studies Association of North America and the United States Embassy in Cairo.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, a State Security Court judge extended his detention for another 15 days. Dr. Ibrahim's lawyers have said he is being accused of inciting sectarian strife through his seminars on religious relations and defaming Egypt by mentioning public apathy and past election fraud in the aborted film written by Mr. Salem about voting rights.</p>
        <p>The United States has called on Egypt to clarify the accusations against Dr. Ibrahim or release him.</p>
        <p>Many people active in public life in Cairo said that the offensive against the Ibn Khaldoun Center, and now Mr. Salem, is the latest example of how the Mubarak government's 10-year-long war on Islamic fundamentalists has eroded political life, making casualties of all independent political voices.</p>
        <p>''We have a kind of political stability, and we don't have the luxury of miscalculations,'' said Wahid Abdel Maguid, a political analyst with the governmental Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, who believes the limits on opposition political activity are justified by a continuing threat from Islamists. ''We have undemocratic forces here that are more undemocratic than the government.''</p>
        <p>Like other governments in the region, the Egyptian government faced an insurgency by fundamentalists beginning in the early 1990's. It began by imprisoning thousands of suspected militants and then turned its attention in the mid-1990's to trade unions it saw as infiltrated by fundamentalist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. Hundreds of leaders of the Brotherhood and various unions were tried in military courts and jailed. A third wave of arrests -- some 1,300 people so far this year, by Brotherhood estimates -- is now under way.</p>
        <p>Now the government is delaying scheduled union elections, effectively maintaining its freeze on associations that once were a forum for political activity. The Lawyers' Syndicate, for example, which represents nearly 300,000 attorneys, has had its elections postponed, prompting some lawyers to call for nationwide strikes last month.</p>
        <p>''They want no headaches, and every election brings with it a competition,'' said Dr. Essam Elerian, a Brotherhood activist in the nearly defunct doctors' syndicate who just completed five years in jail after being arrested in an earlier crackdown.</p>
        <p>To control charitable and nongovernmental organizations that could be used by fundamentalists, Mr. Mubarak also pushed a law through Parliament last year requiring each group to submit its board members' names and their funding sources to the government for approval.</p>
        <p>Rights groups vowed to ignore the new law, which they said was an attempt by the government to censor and silence them. The law was recently declared invalid by the Constitutional Court on the technical grounds that it had not been submitted to the proper legislative bodies.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people didn't pay attention because they said the government was only fighting fundamentalists, but that's not true,'' said Abou Elela Mady Abou Elela, a former Muslim Brotherhood official. ''Only now are others in civil society realizing how dangerous what the government is doing can be. It's only because of what happened to Saad Eddin Ibrahim.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Abou Elela, who has twice had his petition to form a new political party rejected by Mr. Mubarak's government, said he is not surprised that, as he put it, ''finally one liberal'' has run afoul of the regime.</p>
        <p>''He crossed the lines,'' he said of Dr. Ibrahim. ''He started dealing with sensitive issues like religious minorities, democracy and elections. The government goes wild over these issues.''</p>
        <p>In a message sent from prison and released last Saturday by his wife, Dr. Ibrahim said he is being detained because he planned to set up a monitoring group to observe the upcoming elections for the 444-seat Parliament. ''Certain forces,'' he said, ''are hoping to rig elections again in peace and quiet.''</p>
        <p>The ruling National Democratic Party now controls 97 percent of the seats, a dominance that it has maintained for decades.</p>
        <p>''The government is using Saad as a bogeyman to scare him and other organizations from intervening in the coming elections,'' said Tahseen Bashir, a former Egyptian diplomat and spokesman for President Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar el-Sadat.</p>
        <p>But the battle to suppress Muslim fundamentalists, he added, does not justify a scattershot crackdown on anyone who brings up potentially contentious social issues or tries to create political parties to challenge Mr. Mubarak's ruling party.</p>
        <p>''I'm not calling for chaos, but I'm calling for studied steps for change,'' Mr. Bashir said. ''Too much stability is deadness, a paralysis of the political system.''</p>
        <p>No member of the government would comment on Dr. Ibrahim's case, and prosecutors have not said they are investigating his vote-monitoring project. They have, however, summarily closed down a group related to the Ibn Khaldoun Center that was devoted to encouraging women's participation in elections, and indicated that the short film was the trigger for their investigation.</p>
        <p>The screenplay that Mr. Salem wrote for the film focuses on an Egyptian couple who reflect on how they can best assure themselves a bright future. In one scene, a group of men are sitting around a coffee shop in Cairo complaining. One says there is no good health care. Another says the education system is bad. Another grouses that there is no national dream.</p>
        <p>The couple ends up scolding them. ''You can become a partner in the future by participating in elections,'' they say.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salem said he tried in vain to explain to the prosecutors that the coffee shop complaints were a dramatic device to set up the theme of the film, which was meant to show that Egyptians should vote rather than just gripe to assure themselves a good future.</p>
        <p>But the government interrogators, he said, just kept asking him why he wrote all those bad things about Egypt.</p>
        <p>''To explain a joke is a miserable job,'' Mr. Salem lamented, adding that it reminded him of another joke from the 1960's, when President Gamal Abdel Nasser was in power and suppressed political debate.</p>
        <p>In the joke, a man is arrested by the police for carrying a bag of blank papers. When he asks the police why, they reply, ''Do you think we should wait until you write something bad on them?''</p>
