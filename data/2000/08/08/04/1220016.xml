        <p>There were developments yesterday involving two large reviews.</p>
        <p>The Kmart Corporation in Troy, Mich., named seven finalists in the review for its account, which has been handled for more than five years by Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Billings were estimated at $100 million.</p>
        <p>In addition to Campbell Mithun, the finalists are: the Chicago office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications; Grey Worldwide in New York, part of the Grey Global Group; J. Walter Thompson in New York, part of the WPP Group; Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic; Temerlin McClain in Irving, Tex., also part of True North; and an agency that was not being identified by mutual agreement.</p>
        <p>Final presentations will be made in early September, with a decision expected later that month.</p>
        <p>Also, Southeast Toyota Distributors in Deerfield Beach, Fla., owned and operated by JM Family Enterprises, reinstated an agency eliminated last week from the review for its consolidated account, with spending estimated at $70 million.</p>
        <p>Della Femina Rothschild Jeary &amp; Partners in New York was restored to the review, increasing the finalists to five from four. The change came, said Bob Wolf, managing partner at AAR/Bob Wolf Partners in Los Angeles, the consulting company that is managing the review, after Della Femina Rothschild agreed that if it won the assignment it would use the media buying capabilities of the Omnicom Group, the agency company that owns Della Femina Rothschild along with top management.</p>
        <p>The other finalists are: Gotham in New York, part of Interpublic; Grey Worldwide in New York; Omni Automotive in Birmingham, Ala., part of the Intermark Group; and West Wayne in Atlanta. A decision is expected in mid-September.</p>
