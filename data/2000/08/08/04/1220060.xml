        <p>TRACK AND FIELD</p>
        <p>Donovan Bailey's latest injury is so minor that the Olympic sprint champion guarantees he will compete in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>And he offered proof by starting light training yesterday.</p>
        <p>I've had a lot of obstacles in my career, he said in Toronto. This is just really a bump. I have total confidence everything will be fine.</p>
        <p>The Canadian, the gold medalist at 100 meters in 1996, started training only two days after suffering a small tear of his hamstring in a race in Stockholm.</p>
        <p>I expect a full recovery, said Dr. Tony Galea, a member of Bailey's medical team. It's a small injury in comparison to what he's had.</p>
        <p>Bailey has come back after tearing his Achilles' tendon in September 1998, a career-threatening injury.</p>
        <p>He also overcame an adductor muscle injury 10 days before the 1996 Games in Atlanta, coming back to win the gold medal in a world-record time of 9.84 seconds. (AP)</p>
        <p>HORSES LEFT BEHIND: Some of the biggest names stayed home at San Juan Capistrano, Calif., this week when the United States equestrian team sent its Olympic mounts to Sydney.</p>
        <p>Dropped at the last minute for veterinary reasons was Over the Limit, the promising mount of Kimberly Vinoski, who finished fourth in April at the four-star Rolex-Kentucky event, one of the world's toughest competitions.</p>
        <p>Also missing from the 12-horse team is Out and About, Kerry Millikin's individual bronze-medal ride in 1996. Out and About was unable to complete the Rolex-Kentucky event because of physical problems and did not start last month in the final outing for short-listed horses and alternates.</p>
        <p>A few weeks earlier, Regal Scot -- the former mount of two-time Olympic individual gold medalist Mark Todd of New Zealand -- was withdrawn after Australian officials ruled he broke quarantine.Regal Scot, now ridden by the 1996 U.S. team silver medalist Karen O'Connor, had to be shipped from quarantine at Foxhall Farm in Douglasville, Ga., to Auburn University's veterinary hospital to be treated for an ankle problem.</p>
        <p>We went to a huge amount of trouble with the shipping agent and U.S. Department of Agriculture to make sure the quarantine was maintained while off-site, said Mark Phillips, the United States team's technical adviser.</p>
        <p>But that did not satisfy Australian authorities, who decided the three-week quarantine would have to begin again when the horse left the hospital. The Americans' schedule for flying to Sydney made that impossible, and Phillips also noted the horse had lost so much training time because of his ankle that he would have been out of shape.</p>
        <p>Despite the dropouts, the United States is considered a key contender for the gold medal in Sydney, with the defending champion Australia, New Zealand and Britain. (AP)</p>
        <p>PEREC OUT: France's triple Olympic champion, Marie-Jose Perec, has pulled out of this weekend's national championships because of a painful tendon, her agent, Annick Avierinos, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Perec, 32, who had Epstein-Barr disease, has been trying to regain her form since winning gold medals in the 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Games in Atlanta. (Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>TORCH A SYMBOL OF HOPE: The scene of Australia's worst mass murder, in which 35 people were shot to death, was alight with the Olympic flame yesterday.</p>
        <p>Survivors of a man's shooting rampage four years ago joined in a special observance in Port Arthur before the torch continued a 100-day journey around Australia. The flame will be used Sept. 15 to ignite the cauldron during the opening ceremony for the Sydney Games at Stadium Australia.</p>
        <p>Wendy Scurr, who escaped the massacre, said the torch was a symbol of hope and peace.</p>
        <p>It's the best day of my life, she said after carrying the torch on the 57th day of the relay.The torch relay made a detour to visit Port Arthur, arriving from Hobart, the capital of the island state of Tasmania, by catamaran and departing by helicopter. The flame will return to the Australian mainland later this week to continue its journey to Sydney. (AP)</p>
        <p>RISE IN TV VIEWERSHIP ANTICIPATED: The International Olympic Committee said it expects worldwide television viewership for the Sydney Games to increase 23 percent over the 1996 Olympics, to 3.7 billion.</p>
        <p>Interest in the games, scheduled Sept. 15 through Oct. 1, is peaking in Japan, where 88 percent of respondents said they were very or somewhat interested in watching the games on TV, according to an I.O.C.-commissioned survey of 39 countries.</p>
        <p>In the United States, 72 percent expressed interest, while in Australia, the host country, 78 percent did. No margin of error was given for the survey, conducted by London-based Sports Marketing Surveys Ltd. and the Paris-based Ipsos SA.</p>
        <p>The rekindled interest in the Olympics follows recent scandals involving bribery and influence peddling concerning where the Games would be held.</p>
        <p>NBC paid a record $705 million for domestic broadcasting rights to the Games. The I.O.C. will make $1.3 billion in TV revenue from this year's Summer Olympics, a 48 percent increase from 1996.</p>
        <p>NBC has said it expects to sell as much as $900 million in Olympics advertising and turn a small profit on the Games, NBC Sports Chairman Dick Ebersol said.</p>
        <p>The network has estimated ratings for the Games in the 17.5 to 18.5 range, down from the 21.5 rating the Atlanta Games produced. It said the past Olympics drew more viewers because they were held in the U.S., and 40 percent of its programming was live. All of NBC's coverage of the Games will be on tape. (Bloomberg News)</p>
