        <p>In an escalating battle over the proposed construction of a $500 million shopping mall here, the City of New Haven and the mall's developer filed a  lawsuit today against the project's three main opponents: the neighboring town of Milford, its largest mall and the company that owns it.</p>
        <p>The suit, filed in State Superior Court, is the first of the 16 lawsuits filed over the project in the last two years to be submitted by the mall's  proponents. All the others have sought to block it.</p>

        <p>In an escalating battle over the proposed construction of a $500 million shopping mall here, the City of New Haven and the mall's developer filed a  lawsuit today against the project's three main opponents: the neighboring town of Milford, its largest mall and the company that owns it.</p>
        <p>The suit, filed in State Superior Court, is the first of the 16 lawsuits filed over the project in the last two years to be submitted by the mall's  proponents. All the others have sought to block it.</p>
        <p>In the suit, which seeks unspecified monetary damages, New Haven officials and executives of the New England Development Corporation, the mall's builder, claim that Milford officials and the competing mall owner, Westfield America, violated state antitrust laws by filing baseless suits against the project, a 1.4-million-square-foot center known as the Galleria at Long Wharf.</p>
        <p>Westfield America has spent more than $1 million to lobby Connecticut and federal legislators to repeal $28 million in state financing that has been approved for the mall developer, the suit says.</p>
        <p>''Westfield is bent on maintaining its market dominance at the expense of those who live, work and pay taxes in New Haven,'' Mayor John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven said.</p>
        <p>Ron Cohen, a lawyer for Westfield America, called the proponents' suit ''an act of desperation'' and said the mall project would result in unfair competition.</p>
