        <p>The United States and Russia have agreed to work together to draft and win support for expanded sanctions against Afghanistan, officials said today. The cooperation aims to force the ruling Taliban to end support of Islamic terrorists, the officials said.</p>
        <p>The pledge to expand United Nations sanctions against the Taliban, who control about 85 percent of Afghanistan, was among several measures endorsed in principle by a senior working group of American and Russian officials after two days of talks in Washington.</p>
        <p>According to a statement issued by the State Department, the talks focused not only on stemming the threat of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan and the Taliban's promotion of the production and trafficking of drugs but also on ways of creating ''conditions for Afghans to establish a broad-based government for their country.''</p>
        <p>While the statement did not provide details of the ''further measures'' that Moscow and Washington have endorsed, one American official said that diplomats of both countries favored what he called ''smart'' sanctions. That is a term for actions that could be directed against leaders and their entourages rather than against Afghanistan's beleaguered civilians.</p>
        <p>The official said that these were likely to include a ban on most international trade outside areas like food and medicines, air traffic to Afghanistan and perhaps an arms embargo.</p>
        <p>Last October, the United Nations Security Council, led by Russia and the United States, passed a resolution demanding that the Taliban stop providing refuge to terrorists and that they expel Osama bin Laden so that he could stand trial on terrorism charges stemming from his alleged planning of the bomb attacks that destroyed two American embassies in Africa in 1998.</p>
        <p>The resolution's sanctions, which took effect last November, curtailed international flights by the national airline, Ariana, and froze Taliban assets abroad until Mr. bin Laden and one of his chief aides were turned over.</p>
        <p>The Taliban have refused to expel Mr. bin Laden, who supported their successful effort to expel Soviet forces in the 1980's. But Taliban officials in New York and Islamabad say that he is being closely monitored, is not permitted to give interviews and no longer poses a threat.</p>
        <p>American diplomats said that Russian support of expanded sanctions is important to their winning acceptance within the Security Council, which is increasingly reluctant to impose sanctions that punish civilians for the misdeeds of their rulers.</p>
        <p>While Moscow and Washington disagree on the administration's endorsement of a missile-defense scheme for America and many other issues, they have found common ground in the need to curb terrorism fomented by militant Islamic groups in South Asia. While the administration is trying to stop Mr. bin Laden from planning and financing terror aimed at Americans, both in the United States and abroad, Russia wants to stop the Taliban from supporting Muslim militants fighting Russian forces in Chechnya and from destabilizing neighboring states in Central Asia.</p>
        <p>The talks this week grew out of a summit meeting in Moscow in June between President Clinton and the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. This week's meeting was led by Thomas R. Pickering, under secretary of state for political affairs, and Vyacheslav Trubnikov, Russia's first deputy foreign minister.</p>
