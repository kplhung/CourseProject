        <p>A chart yesterday tracing the decline in television viewing of Republican conventions since 1960 referred incompletely to the networks that were excluded from the ratings for this week. Monday's ratings did not reflect CBS and NBC, which both showed convention coverage as a part of regular programs. Tuesday's ratings did not include CBS. PBS, which does not report ratings overnight, was not the only network excluded from the ratings.</p>
