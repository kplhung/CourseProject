        <p>Editorial says new guidelines on exhibiting borrowed art adopted by Association of American Museums will give museums new ethical leverage in resisting undue pressure from lenders and corporate underwriters</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In its new ''Guidelines on Exhibiting Borrowed Objects,'' the Association of American Museums is intent both on creating a sense of ethical coherence in museum practices and reasserting the uniqueness of museums themselves. The guidelines, announced earlier this week, were written largely in response to questions about financing, undue influence and possible conflicts of interest in staging the ''Sensation'' exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art last year. The art in that show was owned by Charles Saatchi, who also contributed $160,000 anonymously to the Brooklyn Museum and stood to gain if the show increased the value of the artwork.</p>
        <p>''Sensation'' may have served as the immediate incentive for these guidelines, but in fact they address a set of basic conflicts that affect all museums. Museums are supposed to serve as cultural cathedrals, repositories of our most significant artifacts. Yet art makes its way to museums in ways that are often labyrinthine, closely caught up in the politics of power and money, the push and pull of international art markets, individual collectors and powerful patrons. The public has had no way of knowing whether an exhibition of borrowed objects represented the best artistic judgment of the professional curators, or was staged at the behest of hidden donors.</p>

        <p>In its new ''Guidelines on Exhibiting Borrowed Objects,'' the Association of American Museums is intent both on creating a sense of ethical coherence in museum practices and reasserting the uniqueness of museums themselves.

        <p>''Sensation'' may have served as the immediate incentive for these guidelines, but in fact they address a set of basic conflicts that affect all museums. Museums are supposed to serve as cultural cathedrals, repositories of our most significant artifacts. Yet art makes its way to museums in ways that are often labyrinthine, closely caught up in the politics of power and money, the push and pull of international art markets, individual collectors and powerful patrons. The public has had no way of knowing whether an exhibition of borrowed objects represented the best artistic judgment of the professional curators, or was staged at the behest of hidden donors.</p>
        <p>That is the value of these new guidelines. They codify the relations between lenders, exhibitors and financial supporters in a way that makes them transparent and as free as possible of conflicts of interest. When the lender of the artwork is a funder of the exhibition, the museum is to say so. Although the guidelines are voluntary for now, ultimately the accreditation of museums is expected to depend on adherence to these standards. The guidelines give museums new ethical leverage in their effort to resist undue pressure from lenders or corporate underwriters. They help define and protect the boundaries of these essential institutions.</p>
