        <p>As if two gray weeks of nearly nonstop rain were not grim enough, there was even grimmer news for sun worshipers this week. Heavy rains inundated waste treatment plants in three Westchester towns and a sewer main ruptured here in Greenwich, spewing more than two million gallons of mostly untreated sewage into Long Island Sound, forcing health officials to close at least 20 beaches.</p>
        <p>Beach closings, either from sewage overflows or high levels of bacteria in the water, have become something of an annual ritual. This week's spills were relatively small, and the Westchester beaches reopened yesterday. But the incidents in New York and Connecticut served as a reminder that sewage treatment systems remain vulnerable to heavy rain and mechanical problems, despite efforts to keep them up to date. And in some cases, antiquated systems are in need of upgrading and repair, officials said.</p>
        <p>Greenwich, like many towns in the region, has plans to improve its system, and officials had already approved a $2.8 million project to replace the sewer line that broke on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''Our plant will be upgrading,'' said Robert Farfaglia, who heads the town health department's environmental services unit. ''But when you have rain like we have had -- I think we probably had rain for the past 10 days -- sometimes the piping in the old systems becomes overloaded and you'll get these breaks or these overflows.''</p>
        <p>The Greenwich beaches, in Byram and on Greenwich Point, will remain closed for further testing, officials said.</p>
        <p>In Westchester, the heavy rains inundated the sewer system with so much water that five pumping stations, three in Larchmont, one in Mamaroneck and one in New Rochelle, simply could not handle the extra load over the weekend,, said Adam Zabinski, the county's director of waste water treatment. Instead of reaching a treatment plant to be broken down by micro-organisms and chemically disinfected before it was released into Long Island Sound, the raw sewage, a murky mix of fecal matter and other waste, flowed into Long Island Sound without being broken down. untreated</p>
        <p>Despite the limits of the treatment systems and occasional breakdowns, environmentalists and government regulators say the waters around the metropolitan region are far cleaner than a decade or more ago, when many municipalities, including New York City, routinely dumped untreated sewage.</p>
        <p>If beach closures seem increasingly common, experts say, it is because of more frequent testing and greater diligence on the part of local public health departments to prevent waterborne illnesses.</p>
        <p>''Now, fortunately, we know how to monitor and test a lot better,'' said John Atkin, president of Save the Sound, an environmental group in Stamford. ''So there are actually more closure days, but more closure days because we know more rather than the water being significantly worse.'' He added, ''In the 50's and 60's we were going into waters that were probably unhealthy but weren't closed.''</p>
        <p>The health officials' primary concern is that swimmers might ingest human fecal matter, which can cause viruses, gastrointestinal infections, hepatitis and other illnesses.</p>
        <p>Typically, water is safe for swimming within a day or two of most minor incidents, health and environmental officials said. Sewage is biodegradable, and the water and the sun act as a natural treatment and filtration system.</p>
        <p>''The natural ebb and flow of the tides and the waters dissipates the bacteria,'' said Valerie Goldstein, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County health department.</p>
        <p>Eight of Connecticut's 22 state-owned swimming areas were closed on Wednesday because elevated bacteria levels were found in weekly tests of water samples. Robert Smith, the chief of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection's water management bureau, said that none of those closings appeared to be linked to a sewage spill,  but rather to runoff from the rain.</p>
        <p>In some cases, the health risks are probably quite limited, he said.</p>
        <p>''Many of these bathing areas are out in very rural areas where there are no sewage treatment plants that could affect them,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Most of it is probably related to wildlife and geese. So it's a little frustrating because we are getting these high sample results probably related to these geese that are waddling around on the edge of the water. I don't think anybody's thinking there's too much risk associated with the bacteria from geese,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Monitoring of water quality varies from state to state. In its annual report on beach closings, released today, the Natural Resources Defense Council offered its highest praise to New Jersey as ''the only state to have a statewide mandatory beach protection program that includes a bacteria standard, a testing protocol, and mandatory closure requirements whenever the bacteria standard is exceeded.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut was also praised for its ''comprehensive monitoring program.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut monitors state-owned  beaches and provides free laboratory testing to municipalities, which are responsible for monitoring their own beaches.</p>
        <p>The study chastised New York State for not requiring counties to monitor their beaches and criticized New York City for not making greater efforts to warn people not to swim at certain beaches after heavy rainfall.</p>
