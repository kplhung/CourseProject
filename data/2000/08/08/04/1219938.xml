        <p>Editorial hails balloting in Kansas Republican primary that expelled State Board of Education members who gutted statewide science standards by eliminating evolution and Big Bang theory from curriculum; says vote is a triumph for common sense and resounding defeat for creationists whose religious zeal threatens to imperil children's education</p>

        <p>The earth is billions of years old, and will again be so in Kansas, despite reckless attempts by the State Board of Education to deprive its children of modern scientific thinking. Voters put an end to the madness by expelling conservative board members who had gutted statewide science standards last year to eliminate evolution as an explanation of the origin of species and the Big Bang theory to explain the start of the universe. The balloting was a triumph for common sense, and a resounding defeat for creationists whose religious zeal threatened to imperil their schoolchildren's education.</p>
        <p>Thanks to a 1987 United States Supreme Court decision, no state can compel the teaching of creationism in its public schools. But last year the Kansas board took the opposite tack -- banishing evolution from its standards and assessment tests, by a 6-to-4 vote.</p>

        <p>The earth is billions of years old, and will again be so in Kansas, despite reckless attempts by the State Board of Education to deprive its children of modern scientific thinking. Voters put an end to the madness by expelling conservative board members who had gutted statewide science standards last year to eliminate evolution as an explanation of the origin of species and the Big Bang theory to explain the start of the universe. The balloting was a triumph for common sense, and a resounding defeat for creationists whose religious zeal threatened to imperil their schoolchildren's education.</p>
        <p>Thanks to a 1987 United States Supreme Court decision, no state can compel the teaching of creationism in its public schools. But last year the Kansas board took the opposite tack -- banishing evolution from its standards and assessment tests, by a 6-to-4 vote.</p>
        <p>In Tuesday's Kansas Republican primary, three of the six conservatives responsible for that vote were defeated. The triumphant moderate Republican nominees and their Democratic opponents in the general election have pledged to return evolution and the Big Bang to the standards tests, and will have the votes to do so.</p>
        <p>The primary results send a strong message.  Voters in the nation's heartland will not stand to have their children's education hijacked by those who would repudiate modern science in the name of  religion. They know full well that in today's world, their children would be left behind. It is a matter of natural selection.</p>
