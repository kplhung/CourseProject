        <p>Frank Castillo won his seventh straight decision as the host Toronto Blue Jays ended their six-game losing streak, 3-1, over the Texas Rangers last night.</p>
        <p>Castillo (8-5) has not lost since June 1. The right-hander allowed just one run on four hits in seven innings. He struck out five and did not walk a batter.</p>
        <p>After allowing consecutive singles to lead off the sixth, Castillo turned a double play by making a sprawling catch in front of the mound on a ball hit by Dave Martinez. He then threw to second to double up Royce Clayton.</p>
        <p>Castillo, who barely made the club out of spring training, has been Toronto's second best starter this season.</p>
        <p>Chris Woodward, who entered the game hitting .188, hit a tie-breaking, two-out single off Kenny Rogers in the sixth to give Toronto a 2-1 lead.</p>
        <p>Rogers (10-9) allowed two runs on seven hits in six innings.</p>
        <p>The Jays went ahead 3-1 on Shannon Stewart's run-scoring infield single in the eighth off Jeff Zimmerman. (AP)</p>
        <p>INDIANS 5, DEVIL RAYS 1: Jason Bere pitched another strong game for Cleveland, giving up four hits in eight innings in St. Petersburg, Fla.</p>
        <p>Bere (2-0) has won both his starts since being acquired in a seven-player deal with the Milwaukee Brewers last Friday.</p>
        <p>Bere struck out eight and walked two. He benefited from strong defensive support, including two double plays started by first baseman Jim Thome.</p>

        <p>ROYALS SUSPEND BELTRAN: Carlos Beltran, last season's American League rookie of the year, was suspended without pay yesterday by the Kansas City Royals for refusing to report to the team's Florida training complex for rehabilitation of a knee injury.</p>
        <p>The players' association immediately promised to file a grievance today and a default notice if the 23-year-old center fielder does not receive his full paycheck on Aug. 15.</p>
        <p>Kansas City said that if the union acts, it would continue to pay Beltran. Otherwise, the team would risk having Beltran become a free agent if the arbitrator Shyam Das ruled in the union's favor.</p>
        <p>Royals general manager Allard Baird said the team has a policy that players on the disabled list don't travel with the major league club. Baird said Beltran would get back in shape to play quicker in Florida.</p>
        <p>The team cited a provision in each player's contract citing its right to determine where he is treated. The Royals said the suspension would last for 30 days or until Beltran reports to their Haines City, Fla., training camp, whichever is earlier.</p>
        <p>This is an assignment to the minor leagues, union lawyer Michael Weiner said, and you can't assign a player on the disabled list to the minor leagues other than a rehabilitation assignment, and he can't be put on a rehabilitation assignment without his consent.</p>
        <p>Beltran has been on the disabled list with a bruised right knee since July 5. (AP)</p>
        <p>RED SOX CLAIM BROGNA: Rico Brogna, who was injured and then lost his job as first baseman for the Philadelphia Phillies, was claimed off waivers yesterday by the Boston Red Sox.</p>
        <p>Brogna was batting .248 this year in 38 games with one home run and 13 runs batted in. He was hit by a pitch from Matt Blank on May 10 in Montreal, fracturing a bone in his left arm and keeping him out for more than two months.</p>
        <p>After he returned from the disabled list on June 21, Brogna lost his position to Pat Burrell.</p>
        <p>Brogna, 30, who can become a free agent after the season, has hit more than 20 homers and driven in over 100 runs in each of the last two seasons.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox have needed a first baseman since Mike Stanley was released in the midst of a slump. Jose Offerman, who was switched to first base because of defensive troubles at second, was placed on the 15-day disabled list on Tuesday. (AP)</p>
        <p>STANLEY GOING TO ATHLETICS: Mike Stanley, the former Boston Red Sox designated hitter and first baseman, has reached agreement on a contract with the Oakland Athletics, his agent said.</p>
        <p>Stanley, designated for assignment by Boston on July 23, signed with the Athletics on Wednesday night after clearing waivers, the agent Jim Bronner reported.</p>
        <p>Stanley, 37, was hitting .222 with 10 home runs and 28 R.B.I. for the Red Sox this season. He has 183 career home runs in parts of 15 seasons with Texas, the New York Yankees, Toronto and Boston.</p>
        <p>The Athletics were looking for a veteran right-handed hitter to replace John Jaha, who is out for the year with a shoulder injury. (Bloomberg News)</p>
