        <p>Former President Gerald R. Ford's doctors said today that they were ''very pleased'' with his medical progress since he was admitted to Hahnemann University Hospital on Wednesday because of a stroke, and they expressed confidence that he would make a full recovery.</p>
        <p>''The president's doing much better,'' Dr. Robert J. Schwartzman, the hospital's chief neurologist, reported at a midday briefing. ''He's walking, his balance is better, his left hand has returned to normal. He's still having some problems with his tongue and a little bit of slurred speech, but he's in good spirits and doing much better.''</p>

        <p>Former President Gerald R. Ford's doctors said today that they were ''very pleased'' with his medical progress since he was admitted to Hahnemann University Hospital on Wednesday because of a stroke, and they expressed confidence that he would make a full recovery.</p>
        <p>''The president's doing much better,'' Dr. Robert J. Schwartzman, the hospital's chief neurologist, reported at a midday briefing. ''He's walking, his balance is better, his left hand has returned to normal. He's still having some problems with his tongue and a little bit of slurred speech, but he's in good spirits and doing much better.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford was making such good progress that hospital officials permitted Gov. George W. Bush to visit him for 20 minutes shortly before noon.</p>
        <p>''He looked great, sounded good,'' Mr. Bush said as he left the hospital to prepare for his speech tonight accepting the presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention. ''He told me to practice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford, 87, was in Philadelphia to attend the convention when he became ill. He first went to Hahnemann Hospital around midnight on Tuesday, shortly after receiving a warm reception from delegates in the convention hall. After walking in on his own at the hospital, he told doctors he was suffering acute facial pain. He was told he probably had a bad sinus infection and was given some antibiotics and released.</p>
        <p>But after a sleepless night, Mr. Ford returned to the hospital about 9 a.m. Wednesday, again walking in on his own. The symptoms were worse, he told doctors, and besides pain included dizziness, numbness and an inability to speak without slurring words.</p>
        <p>Tests indicated that he had suffered at least one mild stroke in the rear portion of the brain that controls basic functions like balance, speech and swallowing. He was admitted to the neurological intensive care unit.</p>
