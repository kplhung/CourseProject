        <p>The American romance with sports champions may have started in the 1920's. ''In golf there was Bobby Jones, tennis had Bill Tilden, in boxing there was Jack Dempsey, horse racing had the great Man o' War, the Yankees had Ruth and Gehrig, and speedboat racing had Gar Wood,'' writes Anthony S. Mollica Jr. in ''Gar Wood Boats: Classics of a Golden Era'' (MBI Publishing, 1999).</p>
        <p>Garfield Arthur Wood, creator of the handsome Gar Wood mahogany runabout, was known as America's Speed King because he dominated speedboat racing for decades. ''He influenced the whole direction of motor boating,'' Mr. Mollica said.</p>
        <p>In fact, Gar Wood was an inventor and a very successful industrialist, but his passion was racing. He designed and built his boats in his own shop, and after beating his compatriots for several years running he successfully competed abroad. He branched out and manufactured hand-crafted runabouts, knockabouts, launches, commuter yachts and cruisers. Today, these antique Gar Woods are cherished and proudly paraded around the Thousand Islands and Lake George in New York, Harbor Springs, Mich., and Mount Dora, Fla.</p>
        <p>''It was Gar Wood's insistence on uncompromising quality, superior design and outstanding performance that attracts the classic boat collectors around the world,'' said Mr. Mollica, who took care of his family's Gar Wood on Oneida Lake in New York, beginning at age 13. ''The firm maintained its standards even in the worst of times, in the Depression.''</p>
        <p>Gar Woods, known as ''the aristocrats of motorboats,'' were costly. Their buyers included Gordon Hammersley, a New York tobacco mogul who was the first to name his boat a ''cigarette''; William Wrigley, John Dodge, William Randolph Hearst and Lord Louis Mountbatten. Gar Woods will be on parade during Wooden Boat Week in Tahoe City, Calif., from Thursday through Aug. 17. The Tahoe Yacht Club, which was founded in 1925, is sponsoring the 28th Concours d'Elegance, a show of hundreds of antique wooden boats. There will be boat restoration clinics, boat sales, dinner dances and picnics. Information: (530) 583-0447.</p>
        <p>Born in 1880, Garfield Arthur Wood was the third of eight sons of a ferryboat captain and staunch Iowa Republican. He was named after a successful Republican presidential ticket, James Garfield and Chester Arthur. One of 13 children, Wood grew up around boats and was piloting an early gas engine launch in Duluth, Minn., before he was 20.</p>
        <p>In 1910, after graduating from the Armour College of Technology in Chicago, Wood founded his own machine shop in Duluth. In 1911 he invented the hydraulic lift, automating the dumping of loose materials from trucks. He received a patent on the system, built a factory in Detroit and began supplying the lifts to the trucking industry.</p>
        <p>When World War I came, the War Department ordered trucks with his hoists. He also designed and built furnaces, tank bodies for trucks, bulldozers, cranes and tractor attachments. Totally self-made, he amassed $50 million before 1940.</p>
        <p>His first love, however, was speedboat racing. In 1914 he designed Little Leading Lady, a boat that was  hauled by horses on a wooden trailer, and he won every race he entered it in. In 1916 he bought a majority share in a boatyard in Algonac, Mich., north of Detroit, owned by Chris Smith, who in 1922 founded Chris Craft boats. Until 1922, Wood and Smith together built a series of streamlined and nearly unbeatable boats, which Wood personally piloted, beginning with the 1917 Gold Cup in Michigan.</p>
        <p>But style and competitiveness cannot explain all of Wood's successes. Wood, who went to bed by 10:30 p.m. and rose at 5:30 a.m., was an inveterate inventor. He decided to try airplane motors in boats. In 1918, he launched the first hydroplane successfully equipped with an aircraft engine and drove it to win the Thousand Islands Trophy and the 1918 Gold Cup. After the war, he purchased 4,500 government surplus Liberty aircraft engines and established the Detroit-Marine-Aero Engine Company to convert the lightweight engines to marine use.</p>
        <p>By 1920, Wood had piloted the Liberty-powered Miss America to victory at the World's Speedboat Championship in Cowes on the Isle of Wight, the One-Mile North American Championship, his fifth consecutive Gold Cup and the Express Cruiser Championships in Miami.</p>
        <p>He then challenged the Havana Special, the Miami-to-New York express train, to a race, and won the 1,260-mile trip in 47 hours and 23 minutes, beating the train by 21 minutes. The press ate it up.</p>
        <p>In 1925, he took on the 20th Century Limited in a race from Albany to New York City. ''Tens of thousands, perhaps even millions, who were unable to reach the river were kept in touch with the progress of the train and the boat by radio,'' Mr. Mollica writes. ''Half a dozen airplanes accompanied the boat, one of them broadcasting a minute-to-minute account.'' Again he won. He was a national hero.</p>
        <p>In the 1930's, Wood produced longer wooden boats for cruising, exploring and sport fishing. ''One long, narrow, 70-foot prototype had five Liberty engines in it,'' Mr. Mollica said. ''This was the precursor of the PT boat.''</p>
        <p>In World War II the Gar Wood plants converted to military production and churned out Navy boats by the hundreds. After the war, Wood retired; the company closed in 1947. He died in 1970 at age 90. He had built 3,300 Gar Woods between 1922 and 1947.</p>
        <p>James W. Ogilvie-Knowles and Justus Hayes, authors of ''Wood Through Water: Classic Power Boats'' (Michael Friedman Publishing, 1999), write that there are two kinds of antique wooden-boat owners today: the generation that grew up with them, for whom maintaining and operating them is a labor of love, and the younger school, for whom the woody represents a return to a simpler, more genuine way of life.</p>
        <p>Gar Woods attract both. Not that they are easy to buy. Only about 500 survive. The Gar Wood Society web site (www.garwood.com) lists five for sale. There are none from the 1920's, three from the 1930's and two from the 1940's. Each costs $18,000 to $45,000. ''These prices are modest compared to what you will see in Tahoe,'' Mr. Mollica said. ''A 28-foot Gar Wood is now $100,000. The 33-footers are $150,000 to $200,00 -- and you have to beg the owners to sell them.''</p>
        <p>Demand has increased strikingly. ''Gar Wood design and overall styling are recognized as the best of their day,'' Mr. Mollica said. ''Their materials, ride and performance are superior to all the boats of their era and equal to or better than many modern craft. They used real leather in every model as well as furniture-quality mahogany from Honduras.''</p>
        <p>In Tahoe, there is a perfect view of the festivities from a restaurant in Carnelian Bay on Lake Tahoe. Its name? Gar Woods: Home of the Wet Woody.</p>
