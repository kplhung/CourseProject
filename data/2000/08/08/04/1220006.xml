        <p>Three months after Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright declared herself ''humiliated'' by lax security at her department, manifested in one case by the loss of a laptop computer with classified information, officials there are seeking $300 million to upgrade headquarters and hire 900 new employees, most of them security agents.</p>
        <p>Those officials, in charge of the department's security, say the money is needed to protect intelligence and diplomatic secrets in a culture that has long resisted strict controls. They intend to ask for three annual $100 million increments, the first of them next year.</p>
        <p>Their plans include overhauling the electronic turnstiles at the main entrances, using ''biometric'' devices that scan human features like  the eyeball to control access to the most secret areas and raising the number of diplomatic security agents to 1,500, a 50 percent increase.</p>
        <p>The financing request, being drawn up by David G. Carpenter, the department's top security official, is a response to recent highly publicized breaches at headquarters. One was the disappearance in February of the laptop computer containing highly classified files. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is still looking into the loss of the laptop and has issued no finding as to whether it was misplaced or stolen.</p>
        <p>Two months before the laptop's disappearance, investigators discovered an electronic eavesdropping device in a conference room, prompting the Clinton administration to expel a Russian diplomat.</p>
        <p>''Let's face it,'' Mr. Carpenter said in an interview, ''we've been on fire with a couple of incidents. We see ourselves as a target'' of foreign adversaries, ''and we see it as prudent to go beyond what our fellow agencies are doing.''</p>
        <p>Although the security lapses stirred an outcry on Capitol Hill, administration and Congressional officials predict that the new financing  request will meet opposition from a number of Republican lawmakers. Some Republicans tend to resist any increased financing for the State Department, while others maintain that the solution to this particular problem may have more to do with altering attitudes about security than with replacing hardware.</p>
        <p>One Republican critic of the department, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, chairman of the House International Relations Committee, said he would ''carefully examine'' the proposal.</p>
        <p>''But I am not willing to just throw money at the problem,'' Mr. Gilman said. ''It will also take a change in the culture of indifference to security at our State Department and an end to the naive belief that there are no real enemies of our nation in the post-cold-war era.''</p>
        <p>Recommendations being made by  Mr. Carpenter stem from his review of department security practices, an effort that was assisted by experts from the Pentagon, the F.B.I. and the Secret Service, and included the long-term loan of an adviser from the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
        <p>After the laptop incident, Dr. Albright stripped her intelligence bureau of its right to police itself and said she would promote Mr. Carpenter, a former Secret Service agent, to a newly created post of under secretary for security. (Not yet elevated, he remains an assistant secretary.)  Since then, officials said, about 7,000 department employees have been freshly briefed on security procedures, uniformed guards have been assigned to patrol the halls in search of unescorted visitors, and employees have completed surveys to outline their need to handle classified information.</p>
        <p>Some diplomats have privately groused at the measures. Unlike many of their colleagues at the intelligence agencies, those involved in diplomatic work are necessarily in  regular contact with the outside world. The State Department's headquarters welcomes roughly 1,000 visitors a day.</p>
        <p>Within that stream of visitors, about one in seven represents a foreign government, officials say. Moreover, 97 foreign journalists have direct access to the building. Timothy D. Bereznay, an F.B.I. section chief, told lawmakers in May that some journalists were ''hostile intelligence officers.'' But Mr. Bereznay did not elaborate on that assertion, and Dr. Albright made light of it.</p>
        <p>In any event, the department recently tightened its escort policy to prevent visitors from roaming the building freely, and to restrict journalists to areas of the first two floors unless they have escorts as well.</p>
        <p>Further, officials have already allocated $5 million toward overhauling the building's turnstile entrances. The new system will require department employees to punch in a personal identification number, or PIN, in addition to swiping their identity cards past an electronic eye. Under the current system, a stolen card could be used to gain entry, since no PIN is required.</p>
        <p>Department experts have also been exploring the possibility of closing down streets adjacent to the building. In addition to providing a buffer against armed attack, a closed street would give security agents the space to search vehicles before they enter the building's underground parking garage for employees. Currently, only delivery vehicles are inspected.</p>
        <p>But, security officials said, the District of Columbia has e vigorously opposed shutting down streets in an  area where traffic is already commonly snarled by motorcades, bridge traffic and construction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carpenter said there was a crucial need for 500 more diplomatic security agents, in addition to the 400 new engineers, couriers and others he seeks, whose work would be security-related. The agents' duties --  everything from protecting foreign visitors to investigating passport fraud to guarding the secretary of state when she travels -- have already spread the corps, currently at 1,000 members, too thin, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carpenter maintained that the furor over the breaches had enhanced security consciousness at the department. But some lawmakers voice skepticism of any rapid turnaround. They note the department's record not only of allowing foreigners to roam the halls unescorted, but also of seeking confirmation of ambassadorial nominees who have previously committed numerous security violations and of hiring guards, cleaning crews and cafeteria workers who receive only the most rudimentary clearance.</p>
        <p>''The root problem for many in Congress is a cultural issue,'' said a Congressional aide involved in intelligence oversight. ''It's a disdain for security.''</p>
