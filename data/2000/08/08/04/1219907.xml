        <p>TWO of the nation's most popular new vehicles, the Chrysler PT Cruiser and Ford Focus ZX3, have fared badly in government crash tests.</p>
        <p>The PT Cruiser received what amounts to a poor rating -- two stars of a possible five -- for its ability to protect the head of a driver wearing a safety belt in a front collision, according to results released recently by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

        <p>TWO of the nation's most popular new vehicles, the Chrysler PT Cruiser and Ford Focus ZX3, have fared badly in government crash tests.</p>
        <p>The PT Cruiser received what amounts to a poor rating -- two stars of a possible five -- for its ability to protect the head of a driver wearing a safety belt in a front collision, according to results released recently by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The two-door Focus ZX3 got just one star -- the lowest possible rating -- for protecting a rear passenger in a side crash.</p>
        <p>The safety agency conducts crash tests on new or popular models. In the front test, vehicles are run at 35 miles an hour into a solid barrier, replicating a head-on crash between vehicles of the same size and weight. In the side test, a movable, crushable barrier -- designed to crumple like a car -- is rammed into the test vehicle at 38.5 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>For the front tests, a five-star rating indicates a 10 percent or less chance of serious injury. The two-star rating for the PT Cruiser's driver indicates a 36 to 45 percent chance of serious injury.</p>
        <p>The rating for the front passenger was four stars, meaning that there was only an 11 to 20 percent chance of serious injury.</p>
        <p>In side-impact testing, a five-star rating means the vehicle has a 5 percent or less chance of a life-threatening chest injury. The Focus coupe's one-star rating represents a 26 percent or greater chance of serious injury to a rear-seat passenger.</p>
        <p>Both the Focus coupe and PT Cruiser scored better at protecting other occupants.  The PT Cruiser get four stars for protecting the front passenger in a front crash, four stars for the driver in a side crash and five stars for a passenger behind the driver. The Focus ZX3 got five stars for both driver and passenger in a front crash and four stars for the front passenger in a side impact.</p>
        <p>The Focus sedan did better over all, with four stars for driver and front passenger in a front impact; four stars for the rear passenger in a side crash, and three stars for a front occupant in a side crash.</p>
        <p>''We were surprised by the one star,'' said Sara Tatchio, a Ford safety spokeswoman. ''We did closely look at the test itself, and we are not challenging it in any way. But it is not at all what our internal testing showed, so our work is ongoing to figure out what the differential is.''</p>
        <p>Nor is DaimlerChrysler satisfied with the PT Cruiser's score. ''We are clearly a little disappointed with our two-star rating,'' said Daniel Knott, director of vehicle development for small cars, who managed the development of the PT Cruiser.</p>
        <p>''I think it's important to note that if N.H.T.S.A. gave decimal points, we would be a 2.9 star,'' he said. If the head injury score had been 50 points lower, he said, ''it would have been a three star'' -- the rating suggested by the company's own testing.</p>
        <p>By measuring the forces on crash dummies, the agency comes up with scores indicating the severity of injuries. A head-injury score of 1,000 indicates the likelihood of serious trauma, like a skull fracture; the PT Cruiser's score was 1,080 for the driver and 467 for the front passenger.</p>
        <p>Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the safety agency, said that despite deployment of the Chrysler's air bag, the driver dummy's head appeared to hit the steering wheel hard enough to bend it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knott of DaimlerChrysler said that head-injury scores could vary by as much 100 points, and thus the PT Cruiser could have received three stars. But Mr. Hurd said his agency tries to remove any variability from testing. If there is any variation in results, he suggested, it could stem from how a car is manufactured.</p>
        <p>Crash tests use a standard test protocol and are ''very reproducable,'' said Julie Rochman of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which conducts its own tests but has not yet crashed either the Focus or PT Cruiser. ''If you do the same test you should see the same result,'' she said.</p>
        <p>R. David Pittle, senior vice president and technical director of Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said the PT Cruiser's score was a blow to a vehicle that has taken America by storm. ''I think consumers would be rightfully concerned about the safety of the driver position that only got a '2' in this frontal crash test,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For DaimlerChrysler, the poor showing was a second embarrassment from the testing. The company got unwanted publicity when the agency had to pay huge premiums to obtain two of the hot-selling PT Cruisers.</p>
        <p>The agency quietly buys from dealers. Although list prices range from $16,000 to $20,000, the agency had to pay $27,500 and $31,055, highlighting what consumers were calling price gouging by dealers.</p>
        <p>''This is a very popular vehicle,'' Mr. Hurd said. ''My wife says it's cute. My 16-year-old daughter says it's cute. Buyers are paying premiums, and we paid a premium.''</p>
