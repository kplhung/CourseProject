        <p>Pushed by globalization and a boom in corporate law involving mergers and acquisitions, law firms in Europe are undergoing some mergers and acquisitions of their own.</p>
        <p>The changes are also affecting law firms in the United States, as links are forged across the Atlantic. But they are confronting the firms with the challenges of bridging differences in culture, mentality and business practices.</p>
        <p>This year, at least six mergers have redefined some of the landscape for lawyers in Britain and Germany, most recently on Monday when Herbert Smith of London announced a strategic alliance with Gleiss Lutz Hootz Hirsch, of Stuttgart, Germany. At the same time, two mergers have been struck across the Atlantic. In January, Clifford Chance, a leading London law firm, merged with Rogers &amp; Wells in New York and Punder, Volhard, Weber &amp; Axster in Frankfurt, pooling 3,100 lawyers to form the world's largest firm. In June, Titmuss Sainer Dechert of London announced that it was merging, after a loose six-year alliance, with Dechert Price &amp; Rhoads of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>''More and more transactions are coming along that require capabilities in several jurisdictions,'' said Anthony Cann, senior partner at Linklaters, a leading London firm. Last month, Linklaters transformed an alliance with Oppenhoff &amp; Radler of Germany into a full merger.</p>
        <p>Initially, the Continental law firms feared what looked like a British invasion. Linklaters, for instance, expanded in France in 1998 by hiring the cream of a top Paris law firm, Gide Loyrette Nouel. Last year, Linklaters reaped the rewards, obtaining lucrative work in a hostile-takeover battle among three of France's biggest banks, the acquisition by the Total oil group of Fina of Belgium, and a shopping spree by the big retailer Carrefour.</p>
        <p>Developments at Linklaters also reflect the opening of Continental firms to British influence. In 1998, several European firms that had previously allied, including Oppenhoff &amp; Radler, offered Linklaters a place in the alliance in order to gain access to Britain. Linklaters, Mr. Cann said, insisted on a joint integrated partnership, meaning ''we brand together, we bill together, we work together.'' Last week, Linklaters announced the merger with Oppenhoff &amp; Radler. ''Germany is clearly a very strategic jurisdiction,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other partners are not sure what sort of relationship to pursue. Last year, a leading Italian firm, Gianni, Origoni &amp; Partners, joined the Linklaters alliance. But Gian Battista Origoni del Croce, a partner, said his firm was not prepared for a merger.</p>
        <p>The alliance has brought benefits, he said, ''certainly in terms of culture, in terms of methodology, international know-how.'' He added, ''Certain Anglo-Saxon practices are prevailing, and will prevail, so there's a lot to learn.''</p>
        <p>In Madrid, Uria &amp; Menendez, a leading firm, was among the original alliance partners, yet it dropped out last year, figuring that it could survive alone. With the Spanish market flourishing, notably in telecommunications and utilities, and big Spanish banks and industrial companies on buying sprees in Latin America, Uria &amp; Menendez is booming.</p>
        <p>The consolidation in Europe's legal industry partly reflects changes in several countries. In 1993, for instance, Britain dropped rules preventing British lawyers from practicing with lawyers not admitted in Britain. Three years earlier, Germany eliminated curbs on lawyers' practicing in more than one city.</p>
        <p>But the real push came with the wave of mergers and acquisitions encouraged by the single European currency, forcing European governments to sell nationalized industries to meet budgetary requirements and leading to the burgeoning of capital markets to finance increased corporate financial activity. American and British firms were helped by the role of New York and London as financial capitals and their experience in handling the legal work behind corporate finance.</p>
        <p>In part, the British offensive on the Continent was a reaction to the success of American law firms, which followed American investment banks into the lucrative new world of European privatization, mergers and acquisitions.</p>
        <p>In 1996, for instance, when Germany sold shares worth $13 billion in its phone monopoly, Deutsche Telekom, the transaction was handled by two New York law firms, Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Two years later, when Daimler-Benz merged with Chrysler, and the Frankfurt stock exchange began seeking a link with its London counterpart, much of the legal work went to Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. In Italy, when an investor group made a hostile bid for Telecom Italia, which helped set the wave of mergers and acquisitions in motion, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell got much of that work.</p>
        <p>In the process, British and American work habits are prevailing. Ward Bower, a principal at Altman Weil, legal consultants in Philadelphia, says anecdotal evidence indicates that while typical partners in an American firm put in about 1,800 billable hours a year, their British counterparts put in up to one-third fewer hours, and lawyers on the Continent still fewer. And while British firms pay partners based on seniority, many American law firms follow the principle of ''eat what you kill,'' compensating lawyers for the amount of fresh business they generate.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the boom has created a rush for talent throughout Europe, driving up lawyers' starting salaries, which have already been inflated by competition for law school graduates from banks, financial companies and dot-com startups.</p>
        <p>Still, American firms believe increasingly that they cannot stay away. ''If you are not able to serve clients all over the world, maybe someone else can,'' said Jason Kravitt, co-chairman of Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt in Chicago, one of many United States firms seeking to expand in Europe.</p>
        <p>Others, however, like Mr. Bower of Altman Weil, say that further trans-Atlantic mergers may take a while to come. ''I don't see it until the next recession,'' he said, when law firms are forced to muster their assets and economize. ''Right now, they are fat and happy.''</p>
        <p>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS  Correction:  August 15, 2000, Tuesday  An article in Business Day on Aug. 4 about mergers among law firms in Europe and about the success that American law firms have had in European mergers and acquisitions misidentified a United States firm that did much of the work on the merger between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler and on the possible link between the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges. It is Shearman &amp; Sterling, not Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.</p>
