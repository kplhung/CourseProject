        <p>Women aren't happy with their situations despite today's good times, Bob Herbert reports (column, July 31). Once again, politicians, if they pay attention to women at all, have to scratch their heads and say, ''What do women want this time?''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Women aren't happy with their situations despite today's good times, Bob Herbert reports (column, July 31). Once again, politicians, if they pay attention to women at all, have to scratch their heads and say, ''What do women want this time?''</p>
        <p>Perhaps women's dissatisfaction with the values they see around them would be lessened if our politicians were willing to address real security and work for a nonviolent society that truly puts its children first. Women like to imagine a society willing to pay the cost of programs like Head Start even if it means one less expensive new weapons program for the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>SAYRE SHELDON  Arlington, Mass., Aug. 1, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a former president of Women's Action for New Directions, a national peace organization.</p>
