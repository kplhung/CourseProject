        <p>WALTER INDUSTRIES INC., Tampa, Fla., which builds and finances houses and makes industrial products, said it would cut 5 percent of its work force, or about 375 employees. Robert G. Burton, chief executive, resigned after about three months in the post.</p>
        <p>MEDIACOM COMMUNICATIONS CORP., Middletown, N.Y., a provider of cable television in rural areas, will buy two cable franchises: one with 12,000 subscribers for $27.5 million near Sioux Falls, S.D., and the other, with 1,000 customers in northern Illinois, for $1.4 million.</p>
        <p>PACCAR INC., Bellevue, Wash., a truckmaker, is indefinitely laying off about 370 assembly workers, or about a third of the total at a plant in Madison, Tenn., and as many as 60 managers, which would be about a fifth of the salaried employees, as heavy-truck sales decline.</p>
        <p>DAIMLERCHRYSLER A.G., Stuttgart, Germany, said it would idle its Jeep assembly plant in Toledo, Ohio, next week because of a backlog of Cherokee and Wrangler sport utility vehicles. The idling would result in the temporary layoff of about 2,800 of the 5,200 workers at the plant.</p>
