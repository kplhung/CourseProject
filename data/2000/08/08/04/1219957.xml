        <p>For 40 years, more than half her life, Kitty Field nurtured her trees. There was one orange, one lime, one grapefruit, and the blossoms and fruit filled the yard with fragrance and color. It just looked like Florida somehow, and she and her husband, Ernest, grew old under their leaves.</p>
        <p>''The leaves are green,'' Mrs. Field said. ''The fruit is perfect.''</p>
        <p>What could be more harmless, she wonders, than her tiny grove?</p>
        <p>But recently, state inspectors searching for the dreaded citrus canker disease came into the Fields'  yard in North Miami Beach and painted a red ''X'' on all three trees, marking them for destruction.</p>
        <p>''These trees are like our children,'' Mrs. Field said. ''We have watched them grow.''</p>
        <p>Hundreds of thousands of citrus trees, mostly in commercial groves,  in South Florida have already been chopped down to stop the spread of canker, a disease that threatens Florida's citrus industry, which is second only to tourism in the money it takes in. But it is the house-by-house eradication of the canker that seems to be causing the most pain.</p>
        <p>Most people, like Catalina Leal, 86, of Miami and Elvia Perez, 69, of Hialeah, only wept in their yards as Florida Department of Agriculture workers chopped down old citrus trees. But others are more determined. Five times this year, South Floridians met state inspectors with guns or threats of guns.</p>
        <p>The most recent was on Tuesday. The police said Carl E. Lawson, 62, fired his shotgun after two state inspectors approached his home. No one was hurt, but Mr. Lawson was charged with two counts of attempted murder.</p>
        <p>The saddest case came in March, in the city of Tamarac in Broward County. State inspectors had already chopped down three of 95-year-old Nelson Edwards's grapefruit trees.</p>
        <p>When they came for the last one, Mr. Edwards, who can barely see and does not hear well, came to his door with a rifle. It was not loaded, but he worked the rifle's bolt, once, anyway, to try and scare them off.</p>
        <p>''I'm just an old man,'' said Mr. Edwards, when he was asked why he did that.</p>
        <p>It did not save his tree.</p>
        <p>''It's history,'' he said. ''It's gone.''</p>
        <p>Such cases are an extreme. Most people here fire off letters, instead. ''We have written our political representatives,'' Mrs. Field said. ''We will do what is necessary to keep our trees.''</p>
        <p>But yard by yard through South Florida, where citrus trees had stood for decades, there are just stumps now. ''They gave me shade,'' Mrs. Perez said of her trees. ''They gave me happiness. Every morning, I would throw the leftover coffee grounds around the trees. Now, I just throw it in the garbage.''</p>
        <p>There have been three outbreaks of canker in Florida since 1913, and the most recent was detected in 1995. ''That one tree has spread to 700,000,'' said Richard Miranda, public information director for the state's Citrus Canker Eradication Program.</p>
        <p>When state inspectors find a tree with canker, they condemn all trees within 1,900 feet. Trees that show no signs of the disease still must be destroyed.</p>
        <p>The state offers $100 to compensate the owners of the trees, to help offset the costs of planting new trees.</p>
        <p>But what good will it do, some of the elderly homeowners ask, to plant a new twig in the ground this late in their lives? It will be years before the trees bear fruit, and decades before they grow tall and full enough to provide shade.</p>
        <p>For people in their 70's and 80's, what good is that?</p>
        <p>''For them to plant a new tree now won't help them much,'' Mr. Miranda conceded. But, he said, ''if it actually gets into the groves, it can be crippling to the economy of the state.''</p>
        <p>Canker manifests itself on the fruit in raised, brown, corky lesions, surrounded by yellow rings. It attacks the immune system of a tree the same way that H.I.V. affects humans and eventually kills the tree.</p>
        <p>While those whose trees have signs of the disease hate to see them chopped down, those whose apparently healthy trees are within the 1,900-foot kill zone are livid.</p>
        <p>''The ones that were sick were next door, not mine,'' Mrs. Perez said. ''My daughter tells me, 'Mami, get over it, it's just plants,' but I can't.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Leal planted her trees, oranges and other citrus, 23 years ago. She pruned them with a machete, and used boards studded with nails to keep cats off them.</p>
        <p>There was nothing she could do to keep the inspectors away, though she  let them know how it hurt her.</p>
        <p>''I cried in front of them, because I felt very bad,'' Mrs. Leal said. ''But they went ahead and cut them down anyway. I figured I'd have to let them because they're the government.''</p>
        <p>She cannot get used to the sight of the stumps. Her trees were so giving, she said, of fruit, of shade. ''I grew to love them.''</p>
        <p>The thing that some here will miss most is the simple act of reaching up and plucking a fresh orange or grapefruit or lime, and the taste -- as different from a store-bought fruit as a made-from-scratch meal is from a microwave dinner.</p>
        <p>''In the mornings, we put on a pair of slippers and go out to pick oranges, and have them for breakfast,'' said Gil Muratori, 61, a pharmaceutical sales manager in Miami whose trees are under the state's death sentence.</p>
        <p>It is part of being in Florida, of being Floridian. Chopping them up, to many people here, is as wrong as setting fire to a flamingo.</p>
