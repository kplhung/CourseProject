        <p>''Space Cowboys'' begins in 1958, with jaunty western guitar music on the soundtrack and black-and-white vistas of the big sky and empty land around Edwards Air Force Base in the California desert. The first scenes follow the adventures of a group of reckless young pilots who crash their expensive military plane, bicker and fight among themselves and lose the chance to be the first Americans in space to a chimpanzee named Mary Ann and a new civilian agency called NASA.</p>
        <p>There is something odd about the four smooth-faced, jaunty young men who make up Team Daedalus, as the pilots are known. Their faces have the clean, generic good looks we've come to associate with the bygone days of the Eisenhower administration, but their voices have the rasp of hard experience, as well as an uncanny familiarity, since they belong to Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, James Garner and, most recognizably, Clint Eastwood, who also directed the picture.</p>

        <p>''Space Cowboys'' begins in 1958, with jaunty western guitar music on the soundtrack and black-and-white vistas of the big sky and empty land around Edwards Air Force Base in the California desert. The first scenes follow the adventures of a group of reckless young pilots who crash their expensive military plane, bicker and fight among themselves and lose the chance to be the first Americans in space to a chimpanzee named Mary Ann and a new civilian agency called NASA.</p>
        <p>There is something odd about the four smooth-faced, jaunty young men who make up Team Daedalus, as the pilots are known. Their faces have the clean, generic good looks we've come to associate with the bygone days of the Eisenhower administration, but their voices have the rasp of hard experience, as well as an uncanny familiarity, since they belong to Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, James Garner and, most recognizably, Clint Eastwood, who also directed the picture.</p>
        <p>The overdubbing of these craggy, worn voices is a kind of subliminal foreshadowing of the movie's theme, which is that while youth may be pretty to look at, ripeness is all. After the black-and-white prologue, the scene shifts to the colorful present, where the members of Team Daedalus, their voices rejoined to their aching, wizened bodies, reunite to settle scores with the oily officer who grounded them (James Cromwell) and haul their tired carcasses triumphantly into orbit. It seems that a Russian communications satellite outfitted with an operating system like the one Frank Corvin (Mr. Eastwood) designed for Skylab has run into trouble, and Frank is the only man alive who knows his way around such obsolete material.</p>
        <p>So Frank rounds up his old comrades, none of whom seem to have eased into graceful retirement. Tank (Mr. Garner) has become a Baptist minister, Hawk (Mr. Jones) gives stomach-turning thrill rides in an old crop duster, and Jerry (Mr. Sutherland) -- the only team member with a two-syllable name and without a Southwestern twang in his voice -- designs roller coasters and chases women half his age. Frank himself has devoted his golden years to fooling around in his garage.</p>
        <p>Somehow they endure the razzing of their cocky younger colleagues, the meddling of their bosses (Mr. Cromwell and William Devane) and the rigors of NASA's physical fitness program -- including a medical examination scene obviously filmed without body doubles -- and find themselves cleared for takeoff.</p>
        <p>By the time their space shuttle pierces the earth's atmosphere, ''Space Cowboys'' has already ascended to surprising heights of entertainment. The movie's release has been preceded by some derisive eye-rolling, since it appears to be an unlikely hybrid of two incompatible genres: the geezer ensemble comedy and the trouble-in-space action adventure -- ''Grumpy Old Astronauts,'' or ''The Sunshine Boys on the Moon.''</p>
        <p>But just as Tank, Hawk, Jerry and Frank school their arrogant, by-the-book young understudies (Loren Dean and Courtney B. Vance) in the low-key, seat-of-the-pants machismo of an earlier era, so do the scarred show business veterans who portray them knock some sense, and some manners, into a youth-besotted film industry. Back in the late 1950's, when the X-Men were still a gleam in Stan Lee's eye, Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Garner, both now in their early 70's, were rival television gunslingers -- on ''Rawhide'' and ''Maverick,'' respectively -- and they bring to their roles here the easygoing wisdom and humor of long experience.</p>
        <p>Along with Mr. Jones and Mr. Sutherland, who nearly sneaks off with the movie in his hip pocket, they seem to be in a contest to see who can give the most understated performance. Mr. Sutherland's reedy whisper delivers a stream of pickup lines that seem to come from the October 1958 issue of Playboy his younger self is seen perusing early in the movie.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones, nearly 20 years younger than Mr. Garner but with a face that says otherwise, has the most complex role, since Hawk is not only the hot-headed foil for Frank's glowering stoicism, but also the film's romantic lead and its tragic figure. A widower, Hawk falls in love with Sara Holland (Marcia Gay Harden), a NASA engineer who has sacrificed her own dreams of space flight. Ms. Harden, in spite of a credibly unflattering government-scientist haircut, performs with her usual intelligence and charm, while Mr. Jones gives his deepest, most controlled performance since ''Blue Sky,'' in which he also played a military pilot.</p>
        <p>Once the mission itself gets under way, ''Space Cowboys'' surrenders a little to convention. There's not a lot of fresh life to be breathed into the Houston-we-have-a-problem technical difficulty narrative, but the outer-space scenes have a welcome grandeur and luster and enough of a feeling of real danger to keep you interested.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eastwood is ordinarily a rather earthbound director, more interested in the efficient (and sometimes graceless) conveyance of story and character than in visual beauty, but here the special effects, by Industrial Light and Magic, add depth and richness to the movie without distracting from the greater pleasure of watching four great actors reclaim their prime.</p>
        <p>Over the course of his directing career, Mr. Eastwood has quietly advanced a revisionist notion of masculinity, a critique from within of the brutal individualism that made him famous as an actor. His films explore the possibility that the best parts of the old code of manly virtue -- loyalty, good humor, a certain reckless bravado -- might be retained even as its less attractive features are abandoned.</p>
        <p>This time, without succumbing to bitterness or nostalgia or overstating the case for one generation's virtues, he and his cohorts mount a vigorous and funny defense of maturity -- the last thing you might expect from a summer action picture, and one of the reasons ''Space Cowboys'' is one of the best entertainments this season has yet offered.</p>
        <p>''Space Cowboys'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes the kind of salty language and occasional fisticuffs you'd expect from cantankerous old flyboys.</p>
