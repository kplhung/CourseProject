        <p>Close your eyes and Gov. George W. Bush tonight could have been Bill Clinton without the punch -- or Al Gore without the precision.</p>
        <p>In fact, in his acceptance speech, the Texas governor and Republican presidential nominee sought to reorient his party to the center with passages that were strikingly similar to Mr. Clinton's speech at the 1992 Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>His address tonight capped a four-day political production in which Mr. Bush deftly elbowed aside ardent conservatives in an effort to convince America that his party was much like himself -- approachable and open -- and that he is a candidate who can be trusted to safely lead the nation.</p>
        <p>It was an ambitious attempt at re-introducing the Republican Party, akin to Richard M. Nixon's drive in 1968 to transform the once solid Democratic South into a Republican stronghold, or Ronald Reagan's ''Morning in America'' campaign for middle Americans in 1984.</p>
        <p>By stressing ''idealism and inclusion'' and the ''forgotten,'' Mr. Bush sought to give a gracious new twist to the Grand Old Party, moving beyond the battles over impeachment, abortion and culture that had given his party such a harsh face. Rather than invoke Newt Gingrich, Mr. Bush spoke of ''a bipartisan approach to governing.''</p>
        <p>''I don't have enemies to fight,'' he declared. ''And I have no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years. I want to change the tone of Washington to one of civility and respect.''</p>
        <p>Even Democrats conceded that Mr. Bush had mounted an impressive start in setting out a general election campaign that excises the demons that have haunted Republicans by offering a nominee who often sounds very much like his foes.</p>
        <p>And already, many Democrats expressed fear that the display here will force Vice President Gore -- whose campaign is entering a crucial phase with the selection of a running mate and then his own convention in Los Angeles -- to aggressively fire back and depict the convention as a masquerade that obscured the party's platform and rigidly rightward voting records.</p>
        <p>''Hundreds of jaws are dropping of Democratic members of Congress around the country who are hearing of a Republican commitment to their building of schools, hiring of teachers, commitment to the environment and diversity of government,'' said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Will it work? ''It has been skillfully done,'' Mr. Torricelli said. ''The Republicans have succeeded in projecting an image that is not only at total variance with their record but in contradiction of their own platform.''</p>
        <p>That may be exactly what the Bush campaign wants. The calculation -- or at least the hope -- among Republicans is that they will box Mr. Gore in: The more he tries to portray his opponents as insincere the more the vice president risks appearing mean-spirited and political. That is an important reason that Mr. Gore foundered when he tried to lambasteMr. Bush after the primaries.</p>
        <p>And that helps explain why a relentlessly upbeat Mr. Bush managed to topple a popular -- and increasingly defensive -- Gov. Ann Richards in 1994. ''The axis upon which a lot of this turns is Bush's experience against Ann Richards,'' said Richard N. Bond, a former chairman of the Republican Party. ''She got shriller and shriller and shriller -- and less believable. That's the experience in which Bush has based his strategy for this campaign and this convention.</p>
        <p>In this most formal moment for a determinedly informal man, Mr. Bush allowed as to how he possessed the qualities to reach beyond his own party and unite the nation. He tried to make this most political of speeches appear decidedly apolitical.</p>
        <p>''Now is the time,'' Mr. Bush said, ''for Republicans and Democrats to end the politics of fear and save Social Security, together.''</p>
        <p>Beyond echoing Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush went so far as to laud the president -- even as he was skewering him. ''Our current president embodied the potential of a generation,'' he said. ''So many talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But in the end, to what end?''</p>
        <p>As did Mr. Clinton in his acceptance speech eight years ago, Mr. Bush trumpeted themes of compassion and inclusion as he sought to appeal well beyond the Republicans in the hall.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Mr. Bush said that when he was growing up in Midland, Tex., ''our sense of community was just as strong as that sense of promise.'' It was from the playbook of Mr. Clinton, who said in 1992, ''We can restore our sense of unity and community.''</p>
        <p>And tonight, Mr. Bush said, ''Each of us is responsible to love and guide our children, and help a neighbor in need.'' It was an echo of Mr. Clinton, who implored his audience eight years ago, ''take responsibility for your children.''</p>
        <p>Beyond that his opponent sounds like a Democrat, there are other complications for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had the enviable luxury of neglecting conservatives -- and reaching out to independents and even Democrats -- because Republicans of all stripes have eagerly embraced his candidacy. But in addition to competing with Mr. Bush for the swing voters, Mr. Gore at his convention will have to tend to restive Democrats who are not altogether content with their candidate.</p>
        <p>Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said Mr. Gore faces a more perilous balancing act than Mr. Bush. ''He's got a more difficult line to walk,'' Mr. Breaux said. ''Our job is to make sure the base is comfortable and secure -- but be very aggressive in speaking to the moderate middle.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also has to contend with the shadow of Bill Clinton.</p>
        <p>In an interview on the eve of the convention, Mr. Bush went out of his way to say that there was little need to demonize Mr. Clinton. ''The opponent is not President Clinton,'' he said. ''The opponent is Vice President Gore.''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Clinton has been a subtext here all week. It started when Mr. Bush's wife, Laura, voiced the need for people ''to respect the president of the United States of America.'' And tonight, Mr. Bush, by underscoring that ''times of plenty'' are ''tests of American character,'' the governor left no doubt that he regards Mr. Clinton as a tantalizing villain -- and will truly (albeit subtly) try to make him an issue in this campaign.</p>
        <p>To further complicate matters, Mr. Gore also has an interest in seeing Mr. Clinton hover over this campaign. While Mr. Bush's loyalists will try to remind voters of Monica S. Lewinsky, Mr. Gore's will trot out Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary who helped the Clinton-Gore administration preside over the most sustained economic recovery in American history.</p>
        <p>While there was a dash of Mr. Clinton in Mr. Bush's address tonight, the Texas governor also capitalized on his opportunity to reach the largest audience that will likely hear him give a speech in this campaign to ply his charm on the public.</p>
        <p>Republicans said they were confident that their thoroughly unobjectionable, even warm-hearted, message was carried enough on the news to penetrate the hall, even though most of the proceedings were not even carried by the network.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's objective tonight was not entirely different from that of Ronald Reagan, who at his convention in Detroit in 1980 sought to convince Americans that beyond his affability, he was up to being commander in chief. Tonight, Mr. Bush remembered ''Ronald Reagan's optimism'' and -- not to neglect Democrats -- ''Harry Truman's integrity.''</p>
        <p>The thinking of Bush operatives is that if Mr. Bush, like Mr. Reagan, puts to rest worries about his capacity to be president, and reassures moderates that he feels their pain, he can gain the edge by trumping Mr. Gore in the likability category.</p>
        <p>''This is all about George Bush being, in essence, not a bad person and a well-meaning person,'' said William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman. ''Therefore he will do what's right and trust me. There's got to be more to it than that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Breaux put it this way, ''This cannot be a popularity contest.''</p>
        <p>Republicans do not see it that way. To them, it is all about presenting a likable, inclusive candidate and a likable, inclusive party.</p>
        <p>Perhaps they should update Mr. Reagan's wildly successful slogan from 1984, ''It's Morning Again in America.'' Again.</p>
