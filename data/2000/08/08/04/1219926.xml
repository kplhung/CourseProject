        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel met today with President Hosni Mubarak, saying he wanted to clarify for the Egyptian leader his desire to reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians once they show ''responsibility.''</p>
        <p>The meeting, in the port city of Alexandria, lasted about two hours. Mr. Mubarak had met with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, on Wednesday in Alexandria, which is his summer residence.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Barak's first trip outside Israel since returning from the peace talks at Camp David, Md., last week and then watching his governing coalition begin to crumble.</p>
        <p>The 15 days of negotiations ended without an accord, and Israel has blamed Mr. Arafat for their breakdown, an accusation that Arab leaders, including Mr. Mubarak, have rejected.</p>
        <p>''We found in Egypt a listening ear to the complexity of the problem,'' The Associated Press quoted Mr. Barak as saying after his meeting. ''I clarified that we are ready to do what is necessary to achieve an agreement, but we have important interests, and an agreement will only be achieved if the other side demonstrates openness, seriousness and responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Egypt has played a pivotal role in the last seven years as a mediator for the Palestinians and successive Israeli prime ministers. The first Arab nation to sign a peace treaty with Israel, in 1979, Egypt has also had the closest ties to the United States.</p>
        <p>The meeting at Camp David and its aftermath of recriminations have soured Mr. Mubarak's relations with both nations. Still, the Egyptian president has been meeting constantly with fellow Arab leaders since the talks broke down in an attempt to maintain some momentum in the peace effort.</p>
        <p>On the issue of Palestinian sovereignty over Arab East Jerusalem, which Egypt has supported and Israel has steadfastly rejected, Mr. Mubarak has given no indication that he will bend in consideration of Mr. Barak's domestic troubles.</p>
        <p>''Are we supposed to pressure President Arafat to make concessions on Jerusalem?'' Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said after today's meeting.</p>
        <p>''It is not our role to ask any side to accept, without discussion, a stand proposed by the other side,'' he said. ''Our role is to make the two sides reach a fair, reasonable and balanced stand.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, meanwhile, continued on his own peripatetic mission to explain his position around the world. He has already visited France, North African countries and several other Arab nations, and today he arrived in Johannesburg for a meeting with Nelson Mandela, the former South African president.</p>
        <p>''All these meetings between Arab leaders are preparing the Arab world for compromises on issues other than Jerusalem,'' said Mohammad Said Said, a researcher at Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies here, adding that ''Egypt is sending a very clear message to America'' that ''it will not change its stance over Jerusalem.''</p>
