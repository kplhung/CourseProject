        <p>Through Sunday</p>
        <p>This uneven, ecumenical grab-bag of a group show, the first in a funky ground-floor space that usually serves as an artist's studio, feels like the old East Village, which is in itself a startling and refreshing experience to have this late in the life of the SoHo art scene.</p>
        <p>On view are a drawing and painted chair back by Jean-Michel Basquiat along with works by relative old-timers like Taro Suzuki and the writer Edit DeAk (showing fuzzy photographs) and restless up-and-comers like Tom Sachs and Hiroshi Sunari. But most of the names are new.</p>

        <p>DNA Studios</p>
        <p>30 Howard Street, at Crosby Street</p>
        <p>SoHo</p>
        <p>Through Sunday</p>
        <p>This uneven, ecumenical grab-bag of a group show, the first in a funky ground-floor space that usually serves as an artist's studio, feels like the old East Village, which is in itself a startling and refreshing experience to have this late in the life of the SoHo art scene.</p>
        <p>On view are a drawing and painted chair back by Jean-Michel Basquiat along with works by relative old-timers like Taro Suzuki and the writer Edit DeAk (showing fuzzy photographs) and restless up-and-comers like Tom Sachs and Hiroshi Sunari. But most of the names are new.</p>
        <p>Things to watch out for include Seth Quankmeyer's ''Celibacy Pants,'' which shows fiber art going punk (and is the result of a performance, not a macrame class); an equally crazed map of the world by an artist who goes by the name of Bug; the lovingly made little paintings of Sari Carel; Roth Belgum's photo essay on dogs (mostly their teeth); the woozy Goldinesque photographs of Gabriella Bass; and an energetic drawing by David Greenburg about ''the moment when memory grooves into childhood.''</p>
        <p>The East Village-in-the-90's feeling is personified by a sculpture by Bob Partington: a conventional attache case rigged so that flicking a tiny lever enables its owner to surreptitiously ''tag'' any surface it rests on. These disparate efforts and others have been brought together by Alfredo Martinez and Jacob Williams.</p>
