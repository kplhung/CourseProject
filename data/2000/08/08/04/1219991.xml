        <p>Between the bleak, soggy weather here and the buildup for Sunday's Whitney Stakes, perhaps the best race of the summer for older horses, an important race for 3-year-olds on Saturday, has been overlooked. A field of seven is set for the Jim Dandy, and even though the entrants lack accomplishment in Triple Crown races, each has an opportunity to begin a championship run in a wide open division.</p>
        <p>With the Kentucky Derby champion, Fusaichi Pegasus, sidelined -- perhaps forever -- while his owner tries to negotiate his sale as a stallion, and with the Preakness winner, Red Bullet, still recovering from a viral infection and ulcers after running a sluggish third last month in the Dwyer, the 3-year-old championship will be decided in the second half, or summer season.</p>
        <p>Still, the field for Sunday's $1 million Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park in New Jersey, headed by the Belmont winner, Commendable, and More Than Ready, is getting more attention.</p>
        <p>This is the time of year for late bloomers, and one trainer here believes the Jim Dandy offers a saltier field of horses coming into their own. Carl Nafzger will saddle the Belmont's third-place finisher, Unshaded, in trying to meet the goal he set for the gelded son of Unbridled back in the spring.</p>
        <p>''I want to paint that canoe at Saratoga,'' he said then and repeated here, referring to the custom of painting the canoe in Saratoga's infield lake in the colors of the winner of the Travers. ''I was saying all along that he'd come to hand during the summer, and he has.''</p>
        <p>Unshaded is a long-striding late runner who gobbled up ground in the stretch of the Belmont despite an extremely slow pace. In the months since, Nafzger has worked on focusing his horse's charge as he lopes down the backstretch. ''He was waiting on horses and looking around in his races,'' Nafzger said.</p>
        <p>Another challenger making a bid for late summer dominance is Brave Quest, who is trained by John Ward Jr. and who did not even make his first start until March 17. The late start, however, has not kept him from winning four of five races at four different racetracks. His record might have been perfect if Milwaukee Brew, entered in the Haskell, had not caught him at the wire in the Ohio Derby last month. ''But it all starts now,'' Ward said. ''He's turned into a racehorse and he knows what his job is. I'll be very happy if he moves forward off the Ohio Derby and he's given me every indication that he will.''</p>
        <p>The most likely favorite for the Grade II $400,000 race is Albert the Great, trained by Nick Zito. Albert the Great is on a four-race winning streak, his latest an impressive gate-to-wire victory over More Than Ready, Red Bullet and Commendable in the Dwyer. Zito and his colt were invited to the richer Haskell, but the New York trainer opted to keep his runner here. Zito's real goal is the Travers Stakes on Aug. 26.</p>
        <p>''I believe you need to run over this strip to get used to it,'' Zito said.</p>
        <p>Of late, however, every trainer on the grounds, as well as New York Racing Association officials, have been frustrated by the dark skies and daily downpours, which have turned the racing strip into a bog. Several trainers have shipped horses back to Belmont Park for workouts. All have wrung their hands as nine races have already been taken off the turf.</p>
        <p>''It's everybody's undoing,'' said the trainer John Kimmel, who so far has entered horses in only five races. ''You got to take care of your animals and hope the weather clears and you get in some races.''</p>
        <p>Michael Lakow, the N.Y.R.A. racing secretary, would like to have three turf races a day because the usually full and competitive fields attract increased wagering. After eight days of racing, the meeting is averaging only two races, and it has been reflected in the handle. Last year, after eight racing days, the on-track handle was $22,535,447 and the total from all sources was $114,844,266. So far the numbers are off slightly: $20,447,800 on-track and $105,755,657 from all sources.</p>
        <p>''We were lucky we weren't knocked out of the box with the dark clouds that have hung over the area,'' said Bill Nader, N.Y.R.A.'s director of broadcast communications and promotions. ''But with the Jim Dandy and Whitney coming up, and if we get some sunshine, we'll be back on track.''</p>
        <p>With Lemon Drop Kid, Golden Missile and Behrens heading a star-studded field for the Whitney, N.Y.R.A. officials are looking for record attendance and over $19 million in handle, which was done four times last year and once so far this year. But Nafzger, for one, is expecting big things from the Jim Dandy as a mixed-up division begins to run its way back to order. ''This is an exciting group of 3-year-olds,'' he said. ''I'm glad I have a horse that can run in a race like this.''</p>
