        <p>Novartis A.G., one of the world's leading agricultural biotechnology companies, acknowledged yesterday that it had eliminated genetically engineered ingredients from all of its food products.</p>
        <p>The policy was disclosed in a letter sent by a company official to the environmental group Greenpeace and later confirmed by the company. Novartis, which makes Ovaltine, Gerber baby foods, Wasa crackers and various health foods, said in the letter that it had basically achieved its goal by June 30.</p>
        <p>Novartis is the first big food company to eliminate genetically modified ingredients from all its foods worldwide, Greenpeace said. Various companies, such as Frito-Lay and McDonald's, are dropping genetically modified corn or potatoes from some of their food in the United States. And many companies are eliminating them in food sold in Europe, where consumer resistance to such products is particularly strong.</p>
        <p>The move could put Novartis in a delicate spot because its agricultural division continues to sell genetically modified seeds, particularly corn seeds with bacterial genes that allow the corn plant to produce a toxin that kills the corn borer. Novartis is a member of a coalition of agricultural biotechnology companies that is spending $50 million to defend the safety of such crops.</p>
        <p>''It will be interesting to see what they are going to be telling farmers now when they're selling biotech seeds,'' said Charles Margulis, the leader of Greenpeace's American campaign against such foods.</p>
        <p>Novartis said last year that it would eliminate genetically modified ingredients from Gerber baby food, not because it had any doubt about the safety of the genetically engineered crops but because buyers seemed to be wary of them. But it had not been known that Novartis was going to take the same steps for its other foods, as well.</p>
        <p>The company said yesterday that its food division, Novartis Consumer Health, had always intended to make this move, so that Greenpeace's announcement was not new. ''For the past year,'' the company said in a statement from its Swiss headquarters, ''Novartis Consumer Health, in light of consumer sentiment toward genetically modified organisms, has taken practical steps to avoid the use of G.M.O. in its nutrition products throughout the world, taking account of local supply options and regulatory requirements.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Margulis of Greenpeace said the Novartis decision would put pressure on other food companies.</p>
        <p>But Gene Grabowski, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America, which represents brand-name food companies, said the Novartis move would have no effect because the company is not a big a food supplier in this country. ''We're talking about a minuscule amount of food,'' he said. ''Greenpeace has taken the letter and trumpeted it as if this is a big announcement.''</p>
        <p>Novartis's annual food sales in the United States total $1.2 billion, Mr. Grabowski said. More than half of that is in Gerber products, and much of the rest is in special diet food. So the only food affected by the policy with significant sales in the United States to the broad category of consumers is Ovaltine, he said.</p>
        <p>Novartis, principally a pharmaceutical company, plans to merge its agricultural business with that of AstraZeneca of Britain. The combined business will then be spun off into a new company called Syngenta.</p>
