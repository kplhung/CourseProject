        <p>After years of procrastination, Sri Lanka's governing coalition proposed today in Parliament that a new Constitution be adopted to give greater political autonomy to the minority Tamil population in an attempt to help end the 17-year-long war waged by separatist rebels for a Tamil homeland.</p>
        <p>But the measure faces a highly uncertain fate. Despite months of talks aimed at building bipartisan support for the new Constitution, the main opposition organization, the United National Party, decided recently to vote against it.</p>
        <p>In a demonstration that was typical of the rancorous highly partisan politics here -- especially with national elections scheduled for the fall -- opposition members of Parliament booed President Chandrika Kumaratunga today as she introduced the document and then tore the pages of the proposed Constitution to pieces.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kumaratunga is quite unlikely to win passage of the measure in the House without some defections from the United National Party, as well as support from small Tamil parties. The government needs a two-thirds vote to pass the Constitution, but has only a narrow majority in the House. If adopted by Parliament, the measure would then face a referendum.</p>
        <p>''This endeavor, in the final count, would be the only alternative to violence and murder in resolving the Tamil question and for peace in our land,'' the presidential secretariat said in a statement. It has been the lack of a clear-cut two-thirds majority that had discouraged Mrs. Kumaratunga from introducing the Constitution.</p>
