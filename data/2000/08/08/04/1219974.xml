        <p>On the first night of Giants training camp last month, the offensive coordinator, Sean Payton, handed out the diagrams of 45 new plays and told his players to memorize them. On just about every night since, Payton has tacked on 15 to 20 additional plays.</p>
        <p>''We're up over 200 plays now,'' said Payton, who has helped orchestrate the overhaul of the Giants' offense in the off-season. ''Maybe as many as 250.''</p>
        <p>Such a number would explain why Giants training camp practices are frequently interrupted by a whistle before some of the new plays are even run. Back in the huddle, Payton will shout when his players line up in the wrong formation.</p>
        <p>The confusion is understandable, but as the Giants prepare for their first preseason game against the Chicago Bears on Saturday night, it is of some concern to Coach Jim Fassel.</p>
        <p>''I don't want us to use up our three first-half timeouts in the first series of the game,'' Fassel joked earlier this week.</p>
        <p>In the last two days, the Giants have started using a 40-second play clock during practice to simulate game conditions. Perhaps sensing the need to improve, the offensive starters have appeared a little less overwrought. The players will have to keep up, because Payton and Fassel say they are determined to expand the complexity of the offense, week by week and day by day.</p>
        <p>In past seasons, Fassel wanted to keep putting new things into the offense, but pulled back when his players had trouble executing the basics. A year ago, in their first preseason game at Minnesota, the Giants scored 36 points. By the opening game of the regular season, things were considerably less freewheeling. The Giants offense had one field goal and just 107 net yards.</p>
        <p>For now at least, the Giants insist they will stay aggressive and won't scale back the offense.</p>
        <p>''This isn't a threat, but we aren't going to slow down for them,'' Payton said of his players. ''It's their job to pick this up and the right guys will pick it up. We'll get them up to speed. We're going to shove it down their throats rather than wait until they're ready.''</p>
        <p>Still, this morning, Fassel's entire practice was a dress rehearsal -- coaches call it a walk through -- of 15 scripted plays for the start of Saturday's game. And Payton acknowledges that some of his players are still floundering at times.</p>
        <p>''It's mostly the new guys who weren't around for the spring minicamps,'' Payton said. ''So I'm not as worried. I do get nervous when I see the first-teamers not sharp on some things, but that's diminished a lot as camp has gone on. I think we'll be fine Saturday.''</p>
        <p>To Giants fans getting their first glance at the Giants' new-look offense, expect a lot of players in motion before the snap of the ball, multiple shifts and a variety of running backs split wide of the formation. But Fassel won't reveal any of his best tricks. For one, it's the preseason and the Giants play the Bears Sept. 17.</p>
        <p>''There's no sense sharing it all to everybody,'' Fassel said. ''Not just Chicago but Arizona and Philadelphia, too.''</p>
        <p>The Giants open at home with Arizona Sept. 3 and are at Philadelphia Sept. 10.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Lightning struck a tree about 100 yards from a courtyard where a handful of Giants players and coaches were conducting news media interviews following lunch Thursday. Five members of the campus police at the State University at Albany who were standing near the tree were transported to nearby hospitals, examined and released. While thunder could be heard faintly in the distance, it was not raining and there had been no other warning of lightning in the area.</p>
        <p>Coach JIM FASSEL said he wasn't sure if running back JOE MONTGOMERY would play in Saturday night's preseason game. Montgomery has a deep cut inside his lip that the Giants are trying to let heal. Running back SEAN BENNETT, who missed practice last week because of back pain, will play.</p>
        <p>Fassel said that safety SAM GARNES, who left Wednesday's practice after being hit in the throat, would play. He wasn't sure if linebacker MIKE BARROW, who hyperextended his right knee when he collided with Garnes, would be ready. Defensive end MICHAEL STRAHAN, who has not practiced this week because of back stiffness, won't play Saturday, but the Pro Bowl linebacker JESSIE ARMSTEAD, who sat out last week's intrasquad scrimmage, will be a starter.</p>
