        <p>Officials at CBS News said yesterday that they would slightly revise their coverage plans for the first night of the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, after television critics and their own employees complained about the way the opening night of the Republican gathering in Philadelphia was handled.</p>
        <p>Sandra Genelius, a spokeswoman for CBS News, said that while the hours and structure of the coverage would not change for Los Angeles, the content of the news program ''48 Hours'' would be modified.</p>

        <p>Officials at CBS News said yesterday that they would slightly revise their coverage plans for the first night of the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, after television critics and their own employees complained about the way the opening night of the Republican gathering in Philadelphia was handled.</p>
        <p>Sandra Genelius, a spokeswoman for CBS News, said that while the hours and structure of the coverage would not change for Los Angeles, the content of the news program ''48 Hours'' would be modified.</p>
        <p>''We're going to do stuff that's more compatible with the convention programming,'' Ms. Genelius said.</p>
        <p>CBS's prime-time coverage on Monday was confined to a portion of ''48 Hours,'' from 10 to 11 p.m. The news division was taken to task by, among others, the anchor Dan Rather, for running a repeat of a piece on medical news that night, and for not covering the speech of Laura Bush, the wife of the presidential candidate, in its entirety.</p>
        <p>''I think the feeling is to make the flow of the hour feel a little smoother,'' Ms. Genelius said.</p>
