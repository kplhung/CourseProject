        <p>After the nominees had spoken and the themes of the Republican National Convention had coalesced on its final day -- we're not your grandma's Republican Party, let's wash the Clinton-Gore stain out of the White House, the sky's the limit -- the cable television pundits and Internet commentators seemed visibly relieved that they finally had a firm idea of the agenda they will be bickering about for the next three months.</p>
        <p>Or maybe they were just relieved that it was time for them to go.</p>
        <p>As the time approached last night for the acceptance speech of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and the twisting rivers of people on the convention floor began to slow and then build up -- ''It's kind of scary for the elderly people here in the Kansas delegation,'' one Fox floor reporter said -- the television cameras began to spend more time watching the stage and scanning the crowd. It was time for the big dog to sing.</p>
        <p>''George W. Bush, that's my final answer,'' a placard read.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, several television channels were cleaning out their stash of leftover features about the wonders of Philadelphia. (Jane Clayson of CBS's ''Early Show'' went rowing on the Schuylkill with octogenarians, for instance.) There were some lingering arguments about how well the vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney's throw-the-bums-out line would play with moderates or whether the convention had been specific enough on policy issues.</p>
        <p>''Look, the Democrats are going to say something about us,'' the Bush strategist Karl Rove told CNN. ''If we'd delivered a four-day economics lecture from the lectern, the Democrats would have said we're not fun.''</p>
        <p>As was widely reported throughout the day yesterday, people have not been watching the convention in droves, a subject of much concern to the people who paid a fortune to cover the event. While the major networks had chipped their prime-time coverage down to an hour or less, shifting the bulk of the work to cable, each of the cable all-news channels was attracting viewership numbers well under a million.</p>
        <p>This is mass media? Perhaps the crowds have moved to the Internet.</p>
        <p>Apparently not. One of the most interesting Web projects at the convention was the partnership between Speakout.com and MSNBC, which allowed viewers to rate the convention's major speakers, in real time, while listening to the speech. Afterward, compiled results were to be posted on the Internet, broken down by sex and by political preference.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday night, when Senator John McCain was the featured attraction, only 426 people bothered to take part, about the size of many high-school graduating classes. It  will never be known how many might have taken part on Wednesday night, when Mr. Cheney delivered his blast at the Democrats, because the whole thing went kaflooey.</p>
        <p>''Due to substantial network failure, we were unable to conduct the scheduled Instant Viewer Response on Wednesday,'' a notice on the Web page said.</p>
        <p>''The cause of the failure is currently under investigation,'' it added, ominously, before concluding with a more upbeat, ''However, full service has been restored and new results will be posted immediately following George W. Bush's speech on Thursday.''</p>
        <p>The demonstrations on Tuesday that resulted in mass arrests in downtown Philadelphia also seemed to have vaporized by yesterday, at least as far as television images were concerned. Perhaps it proved difficult to rally people to the barricades with the slogan, The whole world's not watching.</p>
        <p>Both CNN and Fox presented Generation X panels to talk about how young people were reacting to the convention.</p>
        <p>Meredith Bagby, author of ''We've Got Issues,'' said the whole thing seemed like a big pep rally.</p>
        <p>''I would give the Republicans an A in terms of the pep rally,'' Ms. Bagby said. ''In terms of talking about the issues affecting young people, they did a very cursory job.''</p>
        <p>Alison Fields of Rock the Vote, a voter registration initiative, said she was disappointed that Mr. McCain had not pushed his campaign finance reform message in his speech.</p>
        <p>''He wussed out big time,'' Ms. Fields decided.</p>
        <p>The National Journal decided to find out what the convention's official theme -- ''Renewing America's Purpose. Together.'' -- might possibly mean.</p>
        <p>''Say it four times quick,'' the article by Burt Solomon on the Journal's Web site said. ''Mean anything yet?''</p>
        <p>The Journal's reporter went onto the convention floor to ask people what the slogan meant to them.</p>
        <p>''Back to basics,'' decided Dan Crowley, an alternate delegate from Maryland.</p>
        <p>''Work together,'' said Pat Harvey, a volunteer from nearby Bucks County, Pa.</p>
        <p>''I am going to get spiritual on you,'' said Cindy Costa, a national committeewoman from South Carolina. ''America has a destiny, purposed by God Almighty, and we have gotten away from its precepts, starting in the 60s.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Clayson capped her week in Philadelphia with a montage of images from this, her first national political convention. Yes, a cheesesteak was involved. Did she have any lessons to take back to her co-host Bryant Gumbel in New York?</p>
        <p>''Even though this was a highly staged event,'' she said, ''the people behind it were still very passionate about their politics.''</p>
