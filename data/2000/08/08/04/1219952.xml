        <p>LITTLE did Dawn Ellerbe know, when they handed her a strange metal contraption featuring a ball and a chain, that they were giving her a chance to be an Olympian.</p>
        <p>Hold it this way, they said. Spin. Extend. Let it fly.</p>
        <p>''I got dizzy,'' Ellerbe recalled yesterday in Manhattan, on her way to Sydney. ''I fell down.''</p>
        <p>She doesn't fall down anymore. Ellerbe is the American champion who is very much a medal contender at the first Olympic women's hammer throw, next month in Australia.</p>
        <p>It has taken a while for women to gain the official Olympic license to fling the ancient device made popular by the Celtic hero Cuchulain, who heaved a chariot wheel by its axle, some 4,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>For a long time, the hammer was tossed mainly by hairy-legged, anvil-headed Gaelic, Scottish, Teutonic, Nordic and Anglo-Saxon behemoths in the ancient mists of northern Europe. In the modern Olympics, the event has been dominated by your basic Hungarians and Russians, but now it is also the province of female athletes like Dawn Ellerbe.</p>
        <p>In the Olympic movement, women are performing in more and more events, some of them previously judged too strenuous or esoteric. There was the first marathon in Los Angeles in 1984, soccer and softball in Atlanta in 1996, and now the pole vault and hammer throw in Sydney.</p>
        <p>''It's time,'' Ellerbe said. ''It's not that women weren't there. The first Olympics I remember was with Florence Griffith Joyner, but I wasn't that involved. I'd rather play with my Barbie dolls.''</p>
        <p>She was 14 years old when FloJo ran her victory lap in the Seoul Games in 1988, muscles and eyelashes and fingernails in motion. Ellerbe was already 6 feet 2 inches tall, with a body type that made her suspect she was not going to be the next FloJo.</p>
        <p>''I knew I was a large woman,'' said Ellerbe, now 240 pounds of grace and poise. ''But in the eighth grade, it wasn't fun.''</p>
        <p>She played basketball for a while but was more attuned to the individualism of the shot-put and the discus, how the responsibility was all on her own large shoulders. At Central Islip High on Long Island, she gained a scholarship to the University of South Carolina, where she was introduced to two foreign concepts, the first being training.</p>
        <p>''The first week, we went three hours every day with the weights and running,'' she said. ''I almost passed out. It was a totally different program.''</p>
        <p>The second oddity was the 8-pound-13-ounce hammer, with its steel handle, its clanking chain, and that circular weight, refined from the chariot wheels and axles.</p>
        <p>''The first time I tried it, I couldn't go 100 feet,'' Ellerbe recalled yesterday, ''but I found out I liked it. Some people are linear people and some people are rotational. I'm more rotational. I liked it better than the shot-put and discus.''</p>
        <p>Soon the hammer was her specialty, usually practiced and performed out on the fringe somewhere, so nobody will get skulled.</p>
        <p>''They introduce you, but usually it's only after the main events are over,'' Ellerbe said. ''You don't get to run a victory lap. Nobody throws teddy bears and flowers at you.''</p>
        <p>Blossoming under Coach Larry Judge, Ellerbe qualified for the 1996 nationals, where there was a rumor that the hammer might be included in the next Summer Games. This year she won the national trials in Sacramento, where the hammer was held right inside the main arena. ''People cheering for each of us, every throw,'' Ellerbe said.</p>
        <p>She is one of the 25 athletes who will represent the New York Athletic Club, but most of the year she is a long way from her parents, John and Constance, and her brother, Alan. Ellerbe is currently an assistant coach and trains at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, a college town of 26,000 persons, including the students -- ''one person for every square mile,'' she said with a smile.</p>
        <p>''I never realized there was so much undeveloped land in America,'' Ellerbe added. ''I come from Long Island, and South Carolina is not desolate, but Laramie is different, a great place for me right now, not many distractions. It's like the good old America you see on TV.''</p>
        <p>Ellerbe has earned a degree in advertising and a master's degree in media and communication, all of which comes through when she talks. Yesterday she seemed to relish the photo shoot, rearranging her large supple frame as well as her expressive features. She has come a long way, baby, from the eighth grader who wondered why she had to be the one who was 6 feet 2 inches tall.</p>
        <p>''I accept it,'' she said with a hearty laugh. ''I say, 'If you don't like it, don't look.' ''</p>
        <p>On Sept. 27 and 29, Ellerbe will escape the anonymous exterior fields. In a main event of the world arena, the ancient gadget from the northern bogs will be launched by women from all over the world, and the eye of the camera will like what it sees.</p>
