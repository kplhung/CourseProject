        <p>For four decades, Glen Sather has made this spectacular resort town his summer home. The Bull River flows lazily behind his backyard and the snow-capped Canadian Rockies try to touch a vast, blue sky that seems to have no horizon.</p>
        <p>It has been a place where he could sit back and enjoy the satisfaction of his greatest triumph -- a Stanley Cup dynasty he helped build in Edmonton with Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier, Jari Kurri and Grant Fuhr. Now it is a place from which Sather and his wife, Ann, are preparing to move nearly 2,000 miles to New York and step onto professional sports' brightest and most unforgiving stage.</p>
        <p>The moribund Rangers seem to be a curious challenge for the 56-year-old Sather, who spent the last 24 years with the Oilers as head coach, president and general manager, establishing himself as one of hockey's shrewdest architects.</p>
        <p>''It's an opportunity to win,'' he said, simply, about taking the Rangers' job.</p>
        <p>The Rangers have not qualified for the playoffs for the past three seasons, and have won one Stanley Cup since 1940 and four over all, one fewer than Sather's Oilers did from 1984-90. It is an organization that carried a record $61.2 million payroll last season and had nothing to show for it, except a legion of loyal but cynical fans.</p>
        <p>After three years of lackluster play, poor trades and unacceptable results, Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, fired Neil Smith on March 28 and later hired Sather as president and general manager. Armed with a seven-year contract, Sather was told by Checketts to fix the mess. ''Mr. Checketts told me he wants to build a team that can win,'' Sather said on a recent afternoon at his home, a blade of grass between his lips instead of his trademark cigar. ''He hasn't given me any restrictions on that. And in all the meetings I've been to so far, what has really been talked about is how New York is such a wonderful city, that the fans of the Rangers deserve a better team than they've had.''</p>
        <p>Since taking command on June 1, Sather has made three major decisions. First, he hired a coach, Ron Low, his former backup goaltender and head coach. Then he reached back to the Rangers' most glorious moment, 1994, and re-signed Mark Messier, the leader of that Stanley Cup winning team, to a two-year, $11 million contract.</p>
        <p>In an emotionally charged news conference on July 13, a teary-eyed Messier, who left New York for Vancouver in a bitter divorce in 1997, wore the Rangers' blue sweater with the familiar ''C'' stitched on the front. Last, Sather signed the enigmatic defenseman Vladimir Malakhov to a five-year contract worth at least $17.5 million, to help take the offensive burden off Brian Leetch, the former captain.</p>
        <p>Critics say Sather has picked up where Smith left off, hiring a mercenary army of 30-something players.</p>
        <p>''You spend more money to help the investment you've already got,'' said Sather, who had little money to spend on his Edmonton teams for almost a decade. ''It's like a guy who plants a beautiful garden. He spends $10,000 on it, on plants of all kinds of vegetation, on black topsoil. He waters it. But he never puts fertilizer on it. After the first month, he realizes his mistake and then spends more money for some fertilizer. And all of a sudden, the garden flourishes. It's a lot cheaper than tearing it all up and starting over. You have to work with what you have.''</p>
        <p>Last summer, Smith signed six free agents -- Theo Fleury, Valery Kamensky, Stephane Quintal, Sylvain Lefebrve, Tim Taylor and Kirk McLean -- and the results were disastrous.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe the year all those free agents had was an indication of what they can do,'' Sather said. ''Something happened there that really went wrong. They're all better players and have all had better years than what they had last year in New York.''</p>
        <p>Sather has already met with Fleury, who signed a four-year, $28 million contract, and told him that unless his work ethic improved, he would become the highest-paid player in the history of the American Hockey League.</p>
        <p>Sather also telephoned the veteran defenseman Rich Pilon and told him not to show up for training camp Sept. 8 unless his weight is down to 214 pounds.</p>
        <p>''I want to make everybody accountable,'' said Sather, who played with the Rangers over parts of four seasons in the 1970's. ''I want everyone to be proud of the New York Rangers.''</p>
        <p>Asked about specific rebuilding plans, Sather was evasive.</p>
        <p>''I still don't think it makes any sense to tell the world what I'm going to do until after I do it,'' he said. ''What advantage is there to letting everybody know what your plans are?''</p>
        <p>Still, it is clear that Sather wants an enforcer, someone the Rangers have sorely needed for years. He eventually wants to infuse the team with youth -- ''I still believe that the way to build a team is through the draft and through trades,'' he said -- and apparently is prepared to buy out the contracts of veterans who do not produce.</p>
        <p>''If 20 young guys came on and made the team out of camp, I'd keep five older guys to help lead and mature the other ones,'' Sather said.</p>
        <p>As for the veterans?</p>
        <p>''I'd trade them for draft picks,'' Sather said. ''But you want to see what you've got first.''</p>
        <p>This month, the Sathers will move from their summer home nestled in the spectacular peaks of Western Canada to a penthouse apartment in the granite canyons of Manhattan. Of course, they'll return here when the season is over. Lest anyone think that Sather, a small-market champion, caved in and succumbed to the lure of a long-term ''retirement'' contract, the goal in New York is the same as it was in Edmonton.</p>
        <p>''As far as I'm concerned, this project isn't over until we win the Stanley Cup,'' Sather said. ''Then the preparation starts all over again to win another cup. It's like putting on a Broadway show every night, except this takes longer.</p>
        <p>''But you can never be satisfied in this game. If you are, that's when you're all finished.''</p>
        <p>As far as Sather is concerned, he is far from that. ''I could have stayed in Edmonton and quit when I was 65, been very comfortable and lived a great lifestyle,'' Sather said. ''But who was I going to be fooling? I like challenges. I'm not going to spend the rest of my life doing something I don't believe in.''</p>
