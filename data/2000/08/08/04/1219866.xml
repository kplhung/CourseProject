      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>One encouraging element of ''The Tic Code,'' a small, sincere film with an educational agenda, is its refusal to make its plucky 11-year-old hero, Miles (Christopher George Marquette), a 100 percent adorable movie moppet. A stubborn, hypersensitive youth who knows how to throw a mean tantrum, Miles insists on playing a vaguely ghoulish question-and-answer game, ''Which would you rather,'' with his mother, Laura (Polly Draper), that gives her the creeps.</p>
        <p>''Which would you rather have: no feet or no hands?'' asks the boy, whose excruciating physical self-consciousness is a result of his suffering from the nervous ailment known as Tourette's syndrome. In addition to uncontrollable facial tics and jerky muscular spasms, Miles sometimes emits strange noises that people mistake for laughter. At moments of peak stress, he involuntarily babbles socially inappropriate words. In a challenging role, Mr. Marquette delivers a strong, dry-eyed performance utterly devoid of shameless heartstring-tugging gestures.</p>

        <p>One encouraging element of ''The Tic Code,'' a small, sincere film with an educational agenda, is its refusal to make its plucky 11-year-old hero, Miles (Christopher George Marquette), a 100 percent adorable movie moppet. A stubborn, hypersensitive youth who knows how to throw a mean tantrum, Miles insists on playing a vaguely ghoulish question-and-answer game, ''Which would you rather,'' with his mother, Laura (Polly Draper), that gives her the creeps.</p>
        <p>''Which would you rather have: no feet or no hands?'' asks the boy, whose excruciating physical self-consciousness is a result of his suffering from the nervous ailment known as Tourette's syndrome. In addition to uncontrollable facial tics and jerky muscular spasms, Miles sometimes emits strange noises that people mistake for laughter. At moments of peak stress, he involuntarily babbles socially inappropriate words. In a challenging role, Mr. Marquette delivers a strong, dry-eyed performance utterly devoid of shameless heartstring-tugging gestures.</p>
        <p>Like most movies that examine specific ailments, this gawky, occasionally touching film has the feel of a dramatized case history whose purpose is to educate as much as it is to tell a story. And like most such movies, ''The Tic Code,'' whose title refers to a strategy by which Miles fools the class bully into believing his facial tics are a secret code, is better at educating than at storytelling. Although the rites of passage Miles endures on his path toward fuller self-acceptance are believable, they are an overly contrived chain of events culminating in a melodramatic cliche.</p>
        <p>Miles is unusual in more ways than one. A jazz piano prodigy, he lives in Lower Manhattan with his divorced, fiercely protective mother, who works as a tailor to support the two of them. After school he hangs out at the legendary Village Vanguard, where he occasionally sits in with seasoned musicians. Miles's father (James McCaffery) is also a musician and is constantly on the road. Through overheard telephone conversations, the audience learns that he is in deep denial about his son's condition, which he believes to be neurotic rather than neurological. When he finally appears late in the film, he turns out to be such a monstrous narcissist that he becomes the movie's designated villain.</p>
        <p>At the club Miles develops a protege-mentor relationship with Tyrone (Gregory Hines), a successful jazz saxophonist who also has Tourette's (with much less pronounced symptoms) and who shares the boy's feelings of shame. When Tyrone begins dating Laura, her verbalized concern with her son's ailment brings out Tyrone's own buried rage and insecurity. Fiercely proud, he refuses to discuss the ailment. And when she persists, he accuses her of both exploiting and pitying him. Although Mr. Hines imbues Tyrone with a slouching, hooded-eye cool, his performance seems so detached it remains one step removed from the character.</p>
        <p>''The Tic Code'' is the brainchild of Ms. Draper, who wrote the screenplay and who is married to Michael Wolff, a successful jazz musician with Tourette's. (Mr. Wolff composed the effectively moody soundtrack.) If her screenplay adheres to well-worn dramatic formulas, it is a useful and informative guide to an ailment that is largely misunderstood. (As a sidelight, the movie suggests that Thelonious Monk's stage eccentricities may have been signs of undiagnosed Tourette's.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Draper's taut, self-effacing, extremely quiet performance is the best thing about the movie. She makes us feel the intense pain and devotion of a dedicated single mother who has choked her own desires to see her son through a difficult phase of his life. Without begging for sympathy, she shows the human cost of her self-sacrifice. When her romance with Tyrone rekindles her adult desires, she conveys the quaking insecurity and discomfort of a woman rediscovering a sexuality she had put aside so long ago she almost forgot it existed.</p>
        <p>''The Tic Code'' movie is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some strong language and sexual situations.</p>
