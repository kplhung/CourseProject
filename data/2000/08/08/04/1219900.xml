        <p>Rick Baker's makeup and animatronics studio is on a scruffy commercial strip at the foot of the back side of the Hollywood Hills, but inside it's all fantasy and artifice. A creepy mock graveyard includes headstones for many of the creatures created by Mr. Baker, a four-time Oscar winner, as well as some members of his current staff. Upstairs, the entrance to his office is down a tall, narrow corridor of Gothic arches, at the end of which stands a huge, hooded wraith. In the office, another Gothic marvel filled with antiques, skulls and other creepy artifacts, sits Mr. Baker, wearing a T-shirt and denim pants, his salt-and-pepper pony tail hanging over the back of a wood chair.</p>
        <p>At a time when the movie business is moving deeper into the virtual illusions of computer effects, Mr. Baker represents an older school of actors in rubber suits, robotic creatures and layer upon layer of face-altering makeup. ''I really don't think that computers are going to do away with the makeup side of my business,'' he said. ''But the animatronics? Maybe. I don't know. I do kind of hate to see the rubber monster business disappear.''</p>

        <p>Rick Baker's makeup and animatronics studio is on a scruffy commercial strip at the foot of the back side of the Hollywood Hills, but inside it's all fantasy and artifice. A creepy mock graveyard includes headstones for many of the creatures created by Mr. Baker, a four-time Oscar winner, as well as some members of his current staff. Upstairs, the entrance to his office is down a tall, narrow corridor of Gothic arches, at the end of which stands a huge, hooded wraith. In the office, another Gothic marvel filled with antiques, skulls and other creepy artifacts, sits Mr. Baker, wearing a T-shirt and denim pants, his salt-and-pepper pony tail hanging over the back of a wood chair.</p>
        <p>At a time when the movie business is moving deeper into the virtual illusions of computer effects, Mr. Baker represents an older school of actors in rubber suits, robotic creatures and layer upon layer of face-altering makeup. ''I really don't think that computers are going to do away with the makeup side of my business,'' he said. ''But the animatronics? Maybe. I don't know. I do kind of hate to see the rubber monster business disappear.''</p>
        <p>Normally, Mr. Baker takes on only one project at a time. At the moment,  he is working on Tim Burton's remake of ''The Planet of the Apes.'' Tim Roth, who will play one of the chief apes, was downstairs for a makeup test, and on a nearby table were sculptures of musclebound apes, looking a lot more ''Conan the Barbarian'' than the apes in the original 1968 Charlton Heston film.</p>
        <p>Last year, however, Mr. Baker said he had two offers he could not refuse: to transform Eddie Murphy into a half-dozen characters for ''Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps,'' in theaters now, and to transform Jim Carrey (and 90 other actors) for a big-screen version of ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' to be released this Thanksgiving.</p>
        <p>''I really like to do them one at a time, if I can,'' he said. ''I'm real hands-on. I don't like to spread myself too thin.''</p>
        <p>''Nutty Professor 2,'' a sequel to a remake, was a particular pleasure, he said, because Mr. Murphy is so adept at bringing Mr. Baker's creations to life. In the film, Mr. Murphy plays several members of the Klump family, and the various characters had to be designed to look as if they were related but still had their own distinctive personalities.</p>
        <p>''Not all actors do, but Eddie kind of likes being hidden,'' Mr. Baker said. ''He liked being someone else. It's fun to watch. What he does is he lets me do my thing, then he takes a look at the result in the mirror and decides what kind of voice should come out of it.''</p>
        <p>Also grueling was the process of applying makeup to so many actors for ''Grinch.'' A kind of assembly line, more complicated than anything he had attempted before, was set up on a Universal Studios stage. But the skills he learned doing that are likely to come in handy when he and his crew have to transform dozens of actors into apes, especially since 20th Century Fox is eager for the film to be ready for next summer.</p>
        <p>Basically, Mr. Baker said, he does not design for the camera; he designs for his own eye. ''I make stuff that looks as good as it can look,'' he said. ''No matter what.''</p>
        <p>Reefer Madness</p>
        <p>Brenda Blethyn's sense is that public attitudes toward marijuana and other illegal drugs are just about the same in Britain, where she lives, as in the United States. But she hopes that not too much emphasis is placed on the dope-smoking aspects of ''Saving Grace,'' the new comedy in which she stars as a Cornish housewife persuaded by her gardener to grow and sell pot as a means of saving her impoverished estate.</p>
        <p>''Personally, I believe that it's ridiculous that tobacco and alcohol are legal but marijuana is not,'' Ms. Blethyn said while relaxing before an incongruously raging fire (it was a scorching day outside) in the air-conditioned lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles. ''I don't condone drug use in any way, but perhaps we ought to think about legalizing it. I mean, what we're doing now doesn't seem to be working.''</p>
        <p>The film, which opens on Friday in New York and some other cities (review on Page 25), is the work of the first-time director Nigel Cole and was one of the hits at the Sundance Film Festival in January. Ms. Blethyn was drawn to it, she said, by the plight of her character, who suddenly discovers that her husband has lied to her for decades.</p>
        <p>''I did like it,'' she said. ''The idea: to wake up one morning and discover that 25 years of your life had been a fiction and to suddenly be left destitute.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Blethyn is probably best known for her Oscar-nominated role in Mike Leigh's ''Secrets and Lies.'' While she tends to do most of her work in independent films, in Britain and America, she said she had no aversion to working in a big studio film, if the part was right.</p>
        <p>At the moment, she is also awaiting the release of ''Sleeping Dictionary,'' in which she plays a not altogether sympathetic role as the wife of Bob Hoskins, marooned in the Sarawak jungles of Borneo. Her memories of that shoot are vivid, if not altogether pleasant.</p>
        <p>''It was fascinating, really,'' she said. ''We had a few snakes turn up, and iguanas sauntering onto the set. I mean, seven-foot ones. And there were bugs as big as tennis balls attacking you now and then.''</p>
        <p>She did an imitation of what it was like to try to shoo away a huge insect screeching toward her head. A few people in the lobby paused, looked over with mystification and gradually moved on.</p>
        <p>Jack Warden's Game</p>
        <p>The voice on the phone was unmistakable, stretching back over the years, from ''The Verdict'' in 1982, ''Shampoo'' in 1975, all the way to ''From Here to Eternity'' in 1953.</p>
        <p>''It's funny, but this was the first time I ever got to work with Gene Hackman,'' said Jack Warden, who plays a relatively small role in ''The Replacements,'' a comedy about the National Football League. ''We're friends, but I've never acted with him before. It's an amazing thing, you know. I stand there, and I can't see him acting. Some of these actors, you stand there and you can see them acting, but with him, he's just there. He just is. What better compliment can you pay an actor?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hackman plays a football coach hired by the team's owner (Mr. Warden) to recruit a squad of has-been players to take the place of striking superstars. Keanu Reeves stars as the team's new quarterback.</p>
        <p>''I enjoyed it, I think, because of the subject,'' Mr. Warden said. ''I was a fairly good athlete when I was younger, so I was very familiar with the game. I haven't seen the finished movie yet, just some of the rushes. A friend of mine saw some clips and he said it looked very funny. What else is he going to say? I guess we'll find out.''</p>
