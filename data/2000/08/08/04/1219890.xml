        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>ALLMAN BROTHERS, Jones Beach, Meadowbrook Parkway South, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000. This summer in a less than brotherly move, the career road dogs in this legendary jam band booted one of their own, the guitarist Dickey Betts, citing uncontrollably rowdy behavior. Mr. Betts is publicly denouncing his exclusion. Can the vibe still be good at this show? It's up to Jimmy Herring, the relative youngster (at 38) who is substituting for Mr. Betts, and the crowd that will undoubtledly be even rowdier in Mr. Betts's stead. Hot Tuna, another band that has been bending the blues since heaven knows when, shares the bill. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $40 and $48 (Ann Powers).</p>

        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>ALLMAN BROTHERS, Jones Beach, Meadowbrook Parkway South, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000. This summer in a less than brotherly move, the career road dogs in this legendary jam band booted one of their own, the guitarist Dickey Betts, citing uncontrollably rowdy behavior.

Hot Tuna, another band that has been bending the blues since heaven knows when, shares the bill. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $40 and $48 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>ANTIBALAS, DELE SOSIMI, the Cooler, 416 West 14th Street, West Village, (212) 229-0785. Antibalas brings Fela Kuti's Afro-Beat to New York, updating both its funk and its political messages. It shares a bill with Dele Sosimi, who played keyboards in Fela's Egypt 80. Tomorrow night at 10 p.m.; admission is $10 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>CINDY BLACKMAN QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. She's the drummer in all those Lenny Kravitz videos, but in the other part of her life she's been making tough, straight-ahead jazz records with touches of the harder stuff (rock) for the Muse label since the 80's, using revolving casts of New York City sidemen. Special guest tonight is the saxophonist Ravi Coltrane; tomorrow and Sunday, the former Living Color guitarist Vernon Reid joins the band. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $25 cover and a $10 drink minimum; Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with an $18 cover and a $10 drink minimum (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* CARAMOOR JAZZ FESTIVAL, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-1252. A strong, intelligently booked day of jazz that reconciles the music's aesthetic center with some of its semi-wild strains. The music starts tomorrow at 2 p.m. and ends at 10, with a dinner break. In order: the old-guard saxophone experimentalist Sam Rivers with his trio; the pianist Hilton Ruiz with his trio, which includes the remarkable young saxophonist Chris Potter; the long-running duet of the soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy and the pianist Mal Waldron; the outre sonic painting of the drummer Paul Motian, the saxophonist Joe Lovano and the pianist  Bill Frisell, a great trio that hasn't been performing locally in a while; and, finally, the great saxophonist James Moody, one of jazz's sublime virtuosos and an explosively funny man. Pack a meal and stroll around the pleasant gardens of the Westchester estate if you get restless. Tickets are $40 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* RAY CHARLES, BO DIDDLEY, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800. A double bill of soul and rock pioneers who happen to be wayward American archetypes. If Ray Charles isn't the greatest American singer, he is definitely one of the top contenders. His voice is full of pain and jubilation, cockiness and despair, wisdom and impulsiveness; he knows American music from the blues to Tin Pan Alley to gospel to jazz. With any luck, he'll let his piano playing come through the sound system. Bo Diddley's namesake beat echoes through rock 'n' roll, and the metaphysical boasts in songs like ''Who Do You Love'' are as exuberantly overblown as anything in hip-hop. Behind them both is a profound education in the blues. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $40 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>WILLIE COLON, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, (718) 855-7882, Extension 45. Willie Colon's trombone-driven bands have kept extending salsa's reach: into literary and political songs, into grooves from all over the Caribbean. He is the headliner for the all-day Boricua festival, with food and crafts reflecting Puerto Rican culture. It begins Sunday at noon; admission is free, though a $3 contribution is requested (Pareles).</p>
        <p>DAVE DAVIES, Don Hill's, 511 Greenwich Street, at Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2850, and Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Dave Davies, the lead guitarist and longtime second banana in the Kinks, has lately been touring on his own, telling tales of his long-running sibling rivalry with the Kinks' leader, Ray Davies. His music reminds listeners that he was the one who made early Kinks songs like ''You Really Got Me'' into power-chorded foretastes of heavy metal. He is more wistful in his new songs, but his sets also include well-loved older tunes like his solo hit, ''Death of a Clown.'' Tomorrow at 11 p.m. at Don Hill's; admission is $15. Sunday at 9 p.m. at Maxwell's; admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* KARL DENSON'S TINY UNIVERSE, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. You may not have heard of Karl Denson, but D'Angelo has. The constantly touring soul prince recently nabbed Mr. Denson, a saxophonist and flutist, and his band as an opening act. Jack DeJohnette, a former associate of Miles Davis, and Fred Wesley, pal of James Brown, also know Mr. Denson: they have both recorded with him. The hippie kids who like jam music know him, as do acid jazz fans, because his band draws big crowds from both scenes for their funky, vintage-soul, futuristic sets. Perhaps Mr. Denson's universe won't be so tiny for very long. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $18 (Powers).</p>
        <p>DR. ISRAEL, WILL CALHOUN QUARTET, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The deep, leisurely bass lines of dub reggae are the foundation of jungle, which layers jittery electronic drumbeats on top of those bass lines. Dr. Israel (alias Douglas Bennett), a reggae singer, reunites the two branches of reggae's family tree, singing uplifting messages over vertiginous grooves, which can also veer toward hard-rock and punk power chords. He's working with his new band, Seven. To open the show, Will Calhoun, who played drums in the rock band Living Colour, introduces his new quartet. Tonight at 9; admission is $10 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* ENCUENTROS DOMINICANOS, the plazas at Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5108 or (212) 572-1555. The Dominican Republic's galloping merengue beat is all over New York City clubs and radio stations, but the island's other styles are harder to hear in public. This Sunday afternoon showcase, presented by the Center for Traditional Music and Dance, brings out other, older Dominican styles. On the North Plaza, Coco Merenson plays the Dominican son, rhythm-charged love songs akin to the Cuban son, at 3 p.m.; Francia Reyes performs Afro-Dominican religious songs called palos and salves at 3:45 and 5:15 p.m., with a procession, and the guitarist Luis Diaz and his band play Latin rock with a deep Dominican groove. On Josie Robertson Plaza, the Conjunto Folklorico de la Alianza Dominicana performs traditional dances at 4 p.m.; Ms. Reyes performs at 4:30 p.m. David-David performs the accordion-driven traditional merengue style called perico ripiao at 5:30 p.m., and Bachata Pura plays the sparse, syncopated, broken-hearted ballads called bachatas at 6:15 p.m. Admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>FAUDEL, BRASS CONSTRUCTION, Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, mid-park at 72d Street, (212) 360-2777. Here's an unlikely double bill. The headliner is Faudel, who sings rai, the Algerian music that places impassioned, Arab-inflected singing atop increasingly cosmopolitan grooves. Sharing the bill is Brass Construction, a long-running funk band that had hits in the 1970's. Sunday at 3 p.m.; admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* HAMZA EL-DIN, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. Hamza el-Din, from Egypt, is a cosmopolitan musician -- he has lived in Rome, Tokyo and now the San Francisco Bay Area -- who has fully imagined his own roots. The Nubian songs he has reconstructed are as stark as music gets, often just a vocal line and an accompanying melody plucked on the oud. But his fusion of Nubian and Arabic traditions has a gentle approachability and a hypnotic dignity. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $15 in advance, $17 tomorrow (Pareles).</p>
        <p>DAVID HAZELTINE-JOE LOCKE QUARTET, Up Over Jazz Cafe, 351 Flatbush Avenue, at Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 398-5413. Two solid young mainstream players, on piano and vibraphone -- the sort of guys who you used to see at good old Bradley's, when it existed -- lead a quartet that includes the bassist Essiet Essiet and the drummer Tony Redus. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 10:30 and midnight; cover charge is $15; and there is a $5 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>IRON MAIDEN, QUEENSRYCHE, ROB HALFORD, Madison Square Garden, Seventh Avenue at 32nd Street, (212) 465-6741. Some say Metallica defines heavy music, many swear by Ozzy Osbourne, but there is something unmatchably pure about Iron Maiden's approach to the genre. Apocalyptic visions realized through crunching guitar riffs and ear-damaging drumbeats. Much leather. Long, unstyled hair. None of it has been foolishly updated. The singer Bruce Dickinson and his crew may be nearing retirement age, but they haven't stopped howling. The Maiden's strengths will certainly be matched, too, by this bill's opener, an unholy union between the biggest personality in heavy music (besides Ozzy!), the former Judas Priest singer Rob Halford and the 1980's heir to the style, Seattle's Queensryche. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.; tickets are $41 to $49 (Powers).</p>
        <p>JAZZ PASSENGERS, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. It's rare that these sly, squirrelly and resourceful players appear in a full-fledged New York jazz club. They were an important part of what downtown music was in the 80's, and they're soldiering on into their third decade; though they don't (according to the advertisement, anyway) have Debbie Harry with them this week, their book of compositions keeps swelling with surreal pop songs and archly hip jazz tunes. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 9,11 and 12:30; Sunday at 9 and 11 p.m.; cover charge is $20 tonight and tomorrow and $17.50 Sunday, with a $10 drink minimum both nights (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>KITCHRIE, Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5108. African slaves weren't the only people who came to the Caribbean as laborers; so did Indians, who put the curry into Trinidadian roti and who have forged their own Indo-Caribbean hybrids. The music and dance on this program, presented by the Caribbean Cultural Center, sometimes directly reflects Indian traditions and sometimes mixes them with other island material, as in the songs that use soca rhythms and Indian-style vocal lines; they're called chutneys. Sunday at 8 p.m., admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MARY LOU LORD, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, (212) 420-8392. A singer-songwriter tough enough to break out her guitar and busk for coins wherever she sees fit, Ms. Lord is also a delicate whisperer whose insights into love and limitation are always delightful. Plus, she has got excellent taste in other people's music: she covers Richard Thompson, Elliott Smith and the Bevis Frond, and has recently been slipping some Magnetic Fields songs into her sets. With Jen Wood. Sunday at 8 p.m.; admission is $8, and all ages are welcome (Powers).</p>
        <p>LOST BOYZ, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Rough-hewn, gruff-voiced gangsta rap by a group from Queens that lost a founding member, Freaky Tah, to murder. Tonight at 9; admission is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>NATALIE MERCHANT, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 72nd Street, Central Park, (212) 360-2777. American folk music gets some refreshment from a decidedly modern woman with a strong sense of tradition. Ms. Merchant applies her always intense focus to songs including ''Poor Wayfaring Stranger'' and ''Which Side Are You On,'' finding their idiosyncrasies and celebrating their comforting qualities. Ms. Merchant's faithful can be assured that they will also hear her own lovely, rambling compositions by the show's end. Tonight at 7; tickets: $24 and $28 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* EDDIE PALMIERI, DA LATA, BODY AND SOUL, Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, mid-park at 72d Street, (212) 360-2777. Eddie Palmieri's music is brilliantly volatile, leaping from fierce dance vamps to splashy, experimental modal jazz to deep traditional rumba percussion. He is an experimenter who knows how to carry listeners wherever he wants to go. Da Lata, led by the disc jockey Patrick Forge and featuring the Brazilian singer Liliana Chachian, tosses Brazilian pop and percussion into the international cross-currents of dance music. The event begins tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., with the disc jockeys Danny Krivit and Joe Claussell from Body and Soul; live music starts at 3 p.m. Admission is free. Da Lata also performs on Sunday at 11:30 p.m. at Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8777; admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>PINETOP PERKINS, B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, Midtown, (212) 997-4144. The grand old man of boogie-woogie can still rattle the rafters with his good-time blues; for these shows, he gets some assistance from George Kilbey Jr. and Saffire the Uppity Blues Women. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $20, with a two-drink or $10 minimum (Powers).</p>
        <p>CHRIS POTTER QUARTET, Iridium, 44 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. The young saxophonist Chris Potter is typical of the next crop of mainstream jazz players: he's a combiner. He knows that everything has been done, so he naturally gravitates toward mixtures, and his sets combine expected harmony and form with abstraction and foreign musical styles. He is a lovely player, warm and calm and rather inspired, so it all sounds natural. Sets through Sunday are at 8:45 and 10:45 p.m., with a midnight set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* SONNY ROLLINS, Lincoln Center Out of Doors Festival, Damrosch Park, 62nd Street between Amsterdam and Tenth Avenues, (212) 875-5108. It has been several years since the great tenor saxophonist's famous showdown concerts, in which Mr. Rollins sparred phrase for phrase with Wynton and Branford  and Terence. Not that he needed to, with his unflagging power in a long breath line, his towers of harmony; but they did raise the excitement level. Now his concerts are a bit more predictable: his fairly unpretentious small group plays show tunes, bop and calypso, anything for Mr. Rollins to expound at length upon. He is one of the greatest soloists jazz has ever had, and his appearances are sacred events for the jazz faithful. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; free (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* ALI FARKA TOURE, AFEL BOCOUM, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824. The modal, triple-time riffs Ali Farka Toure plays on his electric or acoustic guitars are kin to the patterns plucked on African instruments by griots; they also bear a family resemblance to the spiky riffs of bluesmen like John Lee Hooker, and they can achieve the same kind of drive and hypnotic power. After he won a Grammy Award for his 1994 collaboration with Ry Cooder, ''Talking Timbuktu,'' Mr. Toure left the international touring circuit to return to his farm in Niafunke, a village in Mali. He's making a rare appearance with his longtime collaborator, the guitarist Afel Bocoum. Tonight at 8; tickets are $35 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>CEDAR WALTON TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. With powerful hands and tidy arranging impulses, Mr. Walton has always been one of the best pianists in New York, and among the relatively few alive to have written a handful of tunes known by every fresh incoming class of jazz students. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., with a 1 a.m. set tomorrow; cover is $20 with a $10 drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* WARM-UP 2000, P.S. 1, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. The clever folks at this groovy art museum have figured out a way to beat the lack of heat this summer: they had the design team called SHoP install an ''urban beach,'' complete with wading pools and deck chairs, where crowds can gather to hear D.J.'s instead of the screaming kiddies and tanning studs one encounters in the Rockaways. Tomorrow afternoon's fare includes sets by Luke Vibert, the Cornish-born experimenter behind Wagon Christ and Plug, plus Miho from Cibo Matto and Sound Track. Tomorrow from 3 to 9 p.m.; suggested admission is $5, $2 for students (Powers).</p>
