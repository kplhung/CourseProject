        <p>William R. Steinberg, a retired union leader who represented ships' radio officers and helped organize a low-cost housing program for retired union members, died Tuesday in Miami Beach, where he lived. He was 87 and formerly had a home in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A native New Yorker, he was a radio officer in the United States Merchant Marine in World War II and became an official of the American Radio Association in New York in 1944. He was elected president four years later.</p>
        <p>He also served on the general executive board of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Its president, Philip Murray of the steelworkers' union, assigned him to join its general counsel, Arthur J. Goldberg, in the negotiations that led to the C.I.O.'s merger with the American Federation of Labor in 1955.</p>
        <p>In the Kennedy administration, Mr. Steinberg worked with federal housing officials and other larger unions to create a program called Four Freedoms to provide inexpensive homes for the elderly. As its founding president, he oversaw the construction of union-sponsored housing in Detroit, Miami Beach, Philadelphia, Paterson, N.J., and Seattle.</p>
        <p>The American Radio Association became Local 2057 of the International Longshoremen's Association in 1982. Now only about 150 strong, its members operate communications and electronics gear aboard the fleet of major American shipping lines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinberg retired as head of the union in 1984 but remained active in it until his death. After retiring, he was chief negotiator in contract talks, which Local 2057 conducts independently of the parent longshoremen's union.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinberg is survived by his wife of 42 years, Lucienne; a daughter, Michele Ammirata of Miami Beach; a son, Edwin A. of Manhattan; five grandchildren; and two great-grandsons.</p>
