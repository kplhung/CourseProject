        <p>Introducing himself to a nation that barely knows him, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas pledged tonight to ''confront the hard issues -- threats to our national security, threats to our health and retirement security'' that he said the Clinton administration had consistently ducked.</p>

        <p>Introducing himself to a nation that barely knows him, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas pledged tonight to ''confront the hard issues -- threats to our national security, threats to our health and retirement security'' that he said the Clinton administration had consistently ducked.</p>
        <p>At a jubilant final session of the Republican National Convention, Mr. Bush argued that ''times of plenty'' were times to solve major problems, not to relax. With that, he sought to cut the ground from beneath his Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore, whose strongest electoral argument is his association with the prosperity of the last eight years.</p>
        <p>His parents and many other members of his large family were in the V.I.P. seats to hear Mr. Bush offer this curt verdict on Bill Clinton's and Al Gore's time in the White House:</p>
        <p>''Our current president embodied the potential of a generation. So many talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But in the end, to what end? So much promise, to no great purpose.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush accused the vice president of indulging in ''the politics of the roadblock, the philosophy of the stop sign.'' He turned Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous first inaugural address around and aimed it squarely at Mr. Gore, charging that ''the only thing he has to offer is fear itself.'' [Transcript, Page A24.]</p>
        <p>He mocked Mr. Gore by saying, ''I do not need to take your pulse before I know my own mind. I do not reinvent myself at every turn. I am not running in borrowed clothes.'' Yet Mr. Bush has been successively moderate, conservative and moderate again, as the imperatives of the nominating campaign dictated.</p>
        <p>In a further, more indirect, thrust at the president he hopes to succeed, the Republican nominee quoted the poet Robert Frost, remembered by older Americans for his appearance at John F. Kennedy's inaugural four decades ago, on the need to ''occupy the land with character.'' Few if any of the thousands who filled the First Union Center here and few of those watching on television can have missed the allusion to Mr. Clinton's sexual involvement with an intern, which led to his impeachment.</p>
        <p>''This administration had its chance,'' Governor Bush asserted. ''They have not led. We will.''</p>
        <p>But as he had pledged, many of Mr. Bush's words were upbeat. ''Tonight we vow to our nation: We will seize this moment of American promise,'' he said. ''We will use these good times for great goals.''</p>
        <p>Except for tonight's gibes and Wednesday night's hard-edged speech by Dick Cheney, his running mate, Mr. Bush and his party have tried all week to avoid the kind of sniping -- to say nothing of the internal bickering -- they know the American electorate detests.</p>
        <p>They succeeded, but not without cost; lacking debate or drama, the convention experienced considerable trouble in attracting TV viewers. Many preferred Regis Philbin or ''Friends'' to the Republicans' voter-friendly show.</p>
        <p>Earlier sessions had had something of the tone of a sales meeting, long on team spirit and short on specifics. But tonight the governor spelled out, far more completely than any other speaker here, his agenda for legislative action.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush proposed major reforms in the public schools, in the Social Security system and in the federal tax code. He promised to abolish the inheritance tax and guaranteed that on his watch no one would have to pay more than a third of his income to the federal government -- considerably less than the 39 percent-plus some now pay.</p>
        <p>And while his delivery seemed at times to be mechanical, his words were often quite forceful.</p>
        <p>His remarks on Social Security, for instance, were unqualified; he said that ''President George W. Bush will keep the promise of Social Security -- no changes, no reductions, no way.'' It was eerily reminiscent of his father's pledge -- ''Read my lips, no new taxes'' -- which plunged then-President Bush into political trouble when he agreed to a tax increase.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush pledged to modernize Medicare, with prescription drugs ''for every senior who needs them,'' stressing the last item more than he had before. He vowed to rebuild the nation's military strength. He said the moment had come ''to make Head Start an early learning program, teach all of our children to read and renew the promise of America's public schools.''</p>
        <p>In a striking passage, he told the strongly conservative Republican gathering, hostile to most new government initiatives, that he intended ''to extend the promise of prosperity to every corner of the country.''</p>
        <p>Far too many in the United States, Mr. Bush said, felt left out and left behind; he called that a challenge ''to the very heart of America.''</p>
        <p>Speaking in much the same vein as Gen. Colin L. Powell had on the convention's opening night, and implicitly reminding his audience of his own doctrine of ''compassionate conservatism,'' Mr. Bush declared, ''We are their country, too, and each of us must share in its promise or that promise is diminished for us all.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''When these problems aren't confronted, it builds a wall within our nation. On one side are wealth and technology, education and ambition. On the other side of the wall are poverty and prison, addiction and despair. And, my fellow Americans, we must tear down that wall.''</p>
        <p>The point was underlined in a video that depicted Mr. Bush as a longtime friend of Hispanics and African-Americans in his home state.</p>
        <p>At 54, Mr. Bush has succeeded where many others have failed. He is only the second son of a former president ever nominated for president by a major party; the other was John Quincy Adams in 1824. Robert Todd Lincoln fell short twice and Robert A. Taft did so three times.</p>
        <p>Tonight's campaign-launching speech was a crucial moment for Mr. Bush, the speech of a lifetime for a politician whose time in elective office has been confined to a bare six years as governor of Texas. Not since Dwight D. Eisenhower, war hero and political neophyte, has a presidential nominee offered so sketchy a political resume.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush dealt candidly with that problem, as well as Mr. Gore's extensive experience on Capitol Hill and in the White House, and sought to turn his inexperience into an asset.</p>
        <p>His background, he conceded, ''may lack the polish of Washington.'' But he added, ''Then again, I don't have a lot of things that come with Washington. I don't have enemies to fight, and I have no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years. I want to change the tone of Washington to one of civility and respect.''</p>
        <p>It was a strong signal that Mr. Bush intends to run as an outsider -- a political tactic dating to Andrew Jackson, but one surprising in a man whose father was president and whose grandfather was a senator.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's acceptance speech was shorter and leaner than many in the past -- 52 minutes long. It had touches of humor -- he took the blame for his mother's white hair -- and a few emotional appeals, like a tribute to his father and other members of the World War II generation. But the nominee's delivery was mostly deadpan, with his lips compressed, with only a few smiles and almost no gestures.</p>
        <p>The delegates, Republican loyalists all, loved what they heard. Harold Fergus, from Pennsylvania, called it a ''leadership speech.''</p>
        <p>''Too often,'' Mr. Fergus said, ''it's 'I've got mine and I'm going to keep it.' He's different. He's trying to be inclusive.''</p>
        <p>Greg Cox, an alternate delegate from San Diego, acknowledged that Mr. Bush had taken ''a few swipes at Al Gore but that was to let people know it would be a down to the wire campaign.''</p>
        <p>Delegates stood and cheered for much of the evening, enveloped at the end in the now-obligatory falling balloons as spotlights swept the crowd, jammed shoulder-to-shoulder in the aisles.</p>
        <p>As for the impact of the speech on independents and other swing voters, on whom the outcome in November will probably depend, that remains to be seen -- not only whether they give him the customary ''bump'' in the polls but how much of it lasts once Mr. Gore gets his four days in the convention sun in Los Angeles later this month.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Bush, who would never claim to be in the same league as an orator with Mr. Clinton or with Ronald Reagan, gave a credible account of himself and made a start at convincing the country that his legs are long enough to reach the stirrups of leadership at home and abroad.</p>
        <p>Andrew H. Card Jr., the convention's major domo, said before tonight's session began that it, like the last three days, would ''be about the future, not about the past.''</p>
        <p>One manifestation of that was the marginalization or the outright absence of many important figures in the Republican party's recent past, including former Vice President Dan Quayle, former Speaker Newt Gingrich, Jack F. Kemp, Lamar Alexander, Steve Forbes and, of course, Patrick J. Buchanan, who is now contending for the Reform Party's presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>There was no place for any of them on tonight's four-hour program, which included several not-quite-hip singers, a former Miss America, four videos, a number of little-known politicians and non-politicians, the actress Bo Derek, several friends of the nominee and his 24-year-old nephew, George P., who delivered part of his speech in Spanish.</p>
        <p>In addition to George W. Bush, the only prominent politicians to speak were Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee and Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, both of whom Mr. Bush briefly considered as running mates.</p>
        <p>At 8:41 p.m., Representative Henry Bonilla of Texas proclaimed an end to the roll call, which had been spread over several nights, saying, ''The chair proudly announces the unanimous choice for president of United States: George W. Bush of Texas.'' Delegates who by this point were not already standing -- a very small number indeed -- rose to their feet as the band broke into its rendition of ''Rock This House.'' Many of those on the floor turned to watch former President George Bush, in the house for a fourth night in a row, as he enjoyed his son's moment.</p>
        <p>Unlike most in the crowd, the former president stayed seated when his son stated his opposition to abortion, a section of the speech that seemed to draw the some of the heartiest applause of the night. And unlike others in the Bush and Cheney families, he stayed off the crowded stage at the evening's close, as if to avoid any chance of upstaging the night's star performer.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush came onstage at 10:04 p.m.; the delegates started clapping and shouting and waving their big red foam-rubber batons, but he ended the demonstration after two minutes.</p>
        <p>Right at the start he called the year 2000 ''a remarkable moment in the history of our country.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Prosperity can be a tool in our hands, used to build and better our country. Or it can be a drug in our system, dulling our sense of urgency, of empathy, of duty. Our opportunities are too great, our lives too short, to waste this moment.''</p>
        <p>At the very end of his speech, Mr. Bush had reassuring words for the Republican faithful and others listening: ''The night is passing, and we are ready for the day to come.''</p>
