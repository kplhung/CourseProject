        <p>The Nets' quandary at shooting guard may soon escalate from bad to horrible. Kendall Gill, the club's most versatile player and obvious replacement for the injured Kerry Kittles, is close to joining the Los Angeles Lakers, an official with an Eastern Conference team said.</p>
        <p>Gill, a starter for the Nets at small forward and shooting guard for the past four and a half seasons, will sign for the $2.25 million midlevel exception or be moved in a sign-and-trade deal. The choice belongs to the Nets, who must decide whether to let one of their most respected players go without gaining anything in return.</p>

        <p>The Nets' quandary at shooting guard may soon escalate from bad to horrible. Kendall Gill, the club's most versatile player and obvious replacement for the injured Kerry Kittles, is close to joining the Los Angeles Lakers, an official with an Eastern Conference team said.</p>
        <p>Gill, a starter for the Nets at small forward and shooting guard for the past four and a half seasons, will sign for the $2.25 million midlevel exception or be moved in a sign-and-trade deal. The choice belongs to the Nets, who must decide whether to let one of their most respected players go without gaining anything in return.</p>
        <p>Two sign-and-trade scenarios have been discussed. One has the Nets sending Gill to Los Angeles for the small forward Rick Fox and the backup point guard Derek Fisher. Another has the Toronto Raptors dealing the shooting guard Doug Christie and possibly center Michael Stewart to the Nets. The Raptors would then receive Fox and Fisher.</p>
        <p>Gill refused to comment on his status with any team, but it is known that he was bothered by the Nets' recent offer of $4 million for one season. He made $5.6 million last season and was set on receiving a raise if he remained in New Jersey, where he believes he has sacrificed personal goals for the good of the team by playing small forward the past three seasons. Perhaps the only way Gill, who averaged 13.1 points last season, will remain with the Nets is in the unlikely event that they decide to pay him $7 million or $8 million for one season.</p>
        <p>Jerry West, the Lakers' executive vice president for basketball operations, could not be reached for comment. Rod Thorn, the Nets' president, said he had no knowledge of Gill's going to the Lakers and added that he hoped to re-sign him. Regarding sign-and-trades, Thorn said, ''We are not going to take anybody we don't think can help our team back in a sign-and-trade.''</p>
        <p>The Nets do not appear to need Fox. Their starting small forward will be the top draft pick, Kenyon Martin. The veteran Johnny Newman, who was signed to a multiyear deal yesterday, will receive most of the backup minutes. Newman, who averaged 10 points in 21.5 minutes a game last season, will be paid $1.5 million next season, and the Nets have an option to retain him.</p>
        <p>Weis's Deal Is News to Knicks</p>
        <p>This summer's Frederic Weis hide-and-seek saga came to its conclusion when the 7-foot-2-inch Frenchman signed to play for the Greek team PAOK Thessaloniki. The French newspaper L'Equipe reported the signing yesterday, indirectly informing the National Basketball Association, the Knicks and Frank Catapano, Weis's agent in the United States.</p>
        <p>''I heard about it from a wire story,'' Knicks General Manager Scott Layden said.</p>
        <p>''I'll give Didier Rose a call tomorrow to see if it's true,'' said Catapano, referring to Weis's French agent.</p>
        <p>The Knicks will retain Weis's rights after his contract expires because he signed with PAOK before Sept. 1. Weis was the 15th selection in the 1999 draft.</p>
        <p>Fortson Is Greeted</p>
        <p>The Knicks' courtship of Danny Fortson got off to a late start as the free-agent power forward arrived last night instead of yesterday morning. Fortson had dinner with Knicks officials.</p>
        <p>The Knicks hope to sign Fortson, one of the league's top offensive rebounders, for the $2.25 million exception.</p>
        <p>In other Knicks news, the club decided to return to South Carolina for training camp. After training at the College of Charleston since 1991, the Knicks observed the N.A.A.C.P.'s boycott of the state before last season's playoffs because the Confederate battle flag flew over the state Capitol.</p>
        <p>Hill and McGrady Join Magic</p>
        <p>After stating his intentions to join the Orlando Magic early last month, Grant Hill's move finally became official. The Magic completed a sign-and-trade deal with the Detroit Pistons that sent Hill to Orlando for the point guard Chucky Atkins and forward Ben Wallace.</p>
        <p>The Magic also completed a sign-and-trade deal for Toronto's Tracy McGrady. In exchange for McGrady, the Raptors received a conditional draft pick. Both Hill and McGrady will receive seven-year contracts worth $93 million from the Magic.</p>
