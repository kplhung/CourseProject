        <p>Dead birds testing positive for the West Nile virus were found in five more counties in upstate New York, indicating a statewide presence of the mosquito-borne virus, the State Health Department announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Traces of West Nile were found in dead birds found in Albany, Dutchess, Putnam, Warren and Washington Counties, some of which are far from New York City and the suburban counties hit hardest by the virus.</p>
        <p>According to the health department, the birds were too young or weak to have flown that far from the city, indicating that they probably contracted West Nile from local mosquitoes carrying the virus.</p>
        <p>''That news shouldn't result in unnecessary alarm,'' said Antonia Novello, the state health commissioner, adding that New Yorkers should take precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites.</p>
        <p>State officials said the threat of the virus was not great enough upstate to begin a pesticide spraying program similar to the one in the metropolitan region, but the health department has produced a public service announcement, for radio stations statewide, urging New Yorkers to get rid of stagnant water around their homes where mosquitoes can breed.</p>
        <p>As of yesterday, 119 birds and 38 samples of mosquitoes had been found infected with the West Nile virus, a slight increase from Wednesday, but officials said they have not confirmed the presence of the virus in any humans. Last year, the disease killed 7 people and seriously sickened 55 others. The elderly, young children and people with weakened immune systems are most at risk for a serious reaction to the virus.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, a dead crow infected with the virus was found in the town of Columbia, the first known case in eastern Connecticut. There were no immediate plans to spray the town, according to state officials, but the state's chief entomologist predicted that the virus would spread through the state and across New England.</p>
        <p>The findings come as New York  braces itself for another round of pesticide spraying tonight in northern Manhattan and parts of the Bronx and Queens. Central Park was scheduled to be sprayed again in the early morning hours today.</p>
        <p>Evidence of the virus continues to be concentrated in the New York City area, especially on Staten Island. So far, the city has ruled out 160 possible human cases of the virus, and is awaiting the results of tests on 40 other people, health officials said.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, state officials have referred six suspected cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The people who were ill showed symptoms of the disease and they lived in counties where dead birds infected with the virus have been found. The test results are expected sometime next week. About 50 people from New Jersey have been tested for the virus so far, but none have tested positive.</p>
        <p>Symptoms of the virus, which can cause encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, include high fever, muscle weakness, disorientation and signs of infection in spinal fluid.</p>
