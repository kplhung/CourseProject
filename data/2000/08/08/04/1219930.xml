        <p>Republicans have chosen a ticket that seems certain to win one state -- Texas -- almost effortlessly. But at the December balloting of the Electoral College, could the Texas electors really vote for both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney? They will have to ask themselves where Mr. Cheney is an ''inhabitant.''</p>
        <p>The 12th Amendment to the Constitution says the presidential electors shall ''vote by ballot for president and vice president, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.''</p>
        <p>For the past several years Mr. Cheney has lived in Dallas, where he became chief executive of an oil services company in 1995. Though two weeks ago he transferred his voter registration back to Wyoming, this scarcely seems sufficient to change his habitation. Could the electors vote for both Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney?</p>
        <p>They could abstain, but that could change the result. If neither vice presidential candidate had a majority in the Electoral College, the Senate would have to choose between them.</p>
        <p>Since President Clinton's attempt to parse words in answering charges that he lied under oath, Republicans have gotten political mileage from saying that only obfuscating lawyers could question the meaning of ''is.'' Is the meaning of ''inhabitant'' any more complicated? Most people -- whether nonlawyers or the constitutional law professors with whom I participate in a nationwide e-mail discussion -- have little trouble recognizing that Mr. Cheney's last-minute change of voting registration has almost literally nothing to do with what state he currently inhabits.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush appears to be confident in the assurances of his lawyers that the 12th Amendment will not be a problem. But if it is a mere technicality to be overcome by clever legal manipulation, then constitutional interpretation is a more complex exercise than the simpleminded reading of the text -- or dubious historical forays into recapturing the intentions of the founding fathers -- favored by two Supreme Court justices whom Mr. Bush says he admires: Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.</p>
        <p>One might well argue, of course, that no rational citizen should care which state Mr. Cheney lives in. But the framers no doubt thought they were doing something important in discouraging any all-New York or all-Virginia tickets and encouraging recognition that the country was made up of quite different states and regions.</p>
        <p>If they are strict constitutionalists, the Texas electors could find themselves required to abstain when asked their choice for the vice presidency.</p>
