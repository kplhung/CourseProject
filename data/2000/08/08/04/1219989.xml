        <p>When General Motors became the first corporation to voluntarily stop writing large checks to political parties in 1997, the automaker's executives sent a powerful message that they were disgusted by the political culture of cash and influence.</p>
        <p>''It's the principle,'' G.M.'s vice chairman, Harry J. Pearce, said after announcing the decision in May 1997.</p>
        <p>Since then, G.M. has stuck to its pledge to forswear soft money, the unrestricted gifts, after donating  $750,000 to political parties in 1996.</p>
        <p>But outside the convention hall and around town this week, G.M., the nation's largest automaker, demonstrated that it had hardly abandoned the campaign finance arena, finding different ways to curry favor with current -- and possibly future -- Republican leaders.</p>
        <p>G.M. provided 400 Cadillacs, sport utility vehicles and minivans for use by the organizers of the Republican National Convention, part of a package of ''in-kind contributions'' that the host committee here estimated was worth $1 million. The automaker is one of many companies that are providing in-kind donations at this convention, and at the Democratic gathering, as they have in the past.</p>
        <p>And today, G.M. sponsored two lunch receptions at different downtown locales -- one honored the speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, and the other saluted Lawrence B. Lindsey, the chief economic adviser to the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>Of the more than 30 corporations that have eschewed soft money, G.M. is not the only company here to play the political influence game without handing out checks.</p>
        <p>Time Warner, which stopped making soft money donations last year, was one of the sponsors of a gaudy packed party on Wednesday night at  the nightclub Shampoo to honor a group of House lawmakers.</p>
        <p>G.M.'s receptions were less flashy but attracted more high-powered political stars.</p>
        <p>At the lunch at the Philadelphia Naval Yard, G.M. designers showed off the newest prototypes, called concept cars, for Mr. Hastert, an unabashed automobile buff. The speaker was joined by members of the House Transportation Committee and was given a miniature replica of a vintage G.M. truck, a 1950 Chevrolet Bullnose pickup, that he is restoring at home in Illinois. The menu was seared tuna, red wine and strawberry souffle.</p>
        <p>After lunch, Mr. Hastert squeezed into several of the concept cars on display, including a voice-activated Buick.</p>
        <p>''You are leading the way and creating the transportation system that is leading the world,'' Mr. Hastert told G.M. executives. ''We salute you and your industry.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, across town, G.M. and G.M.A.C. Financial Services held a brunch honoring Mr. Lindsey, the lead economic adviser to Mr. Bush who is also a consultant to G.M.A.C. and a board member of its subsidiary, Escrow Bank U.S.A. of Salt Lake City.</p>
        <p>The brunch allowed G.M. to showcase its relationship with Mr. Lindsey. In his introduction, John Finnegan, the chairman of G.M.A.C., hailed Mr. Lindsey as ''one of the best economic minds in the nation.''</p>
        <p>After speaking to a group of 100 G.M. executives, lobbyists and a few House members, Mr. Lindsey seemed surprised when he was asked if it was appropriate for the automaker to sponsor the brunch.</p>
        <p>''I have had a three-year relationship with G.M.,'' Mr. Lindsey, 46, said. ''It's a natural thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Several G.M.A.C. vice presidents drew a distinction between the corporation's discarded practice of making soft-money donations and their current practice of holding receptions for consultants and lawmakers.</p>
        <p>''It's not the game we like to play,'' a G.M.A.C. senior vice president, Scott Rombach, said of the practice of giving soft money. ''But this is different.''</p>
        <p>Another G.M.A.C. vice president, Jim Farmer, said, ''This is just a kind gesture to Larry.''</p>
        <p>With much fanfare last November, Time Warner announced it would no longer make soft money donations. The company's chairman, Gerald M. Levin, said much of the soft money had been used for misleading and negative advertising that had cheapened political dialogue.</p>
        <p>Late on Wednesday night, Time Warner's raucous party was attended by about 1,000 lobbyists, House staff members and journalists. As thousands of free drinks were served and the singers Jon Secada and Celia Cruz performed, the attendees toasted Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida and the House Entertainment Industry Task Force, a loose coalition of House members whose decisions affect the media and entertainment industries.</p>
        <p>The party was also sponsored by News Corporation, Seagram's Universal Studios, the Recording Industry Association of America, the Motion Picture Association of America, Viacom and the Walt Disney Corporation.</p>
        <p>Edward Adler, a senior vice president at Time Warner, did not return telephone calls today.</p>
        <p>Another party sponsor, Viacom, the parent of CBS, gives virtually no soft money to political parties, but its political action committee contributes sizable sums to candidates.</p>
        <p>In recent months, several corporations have stopped giving soft money because their executives have said that they had found better uses for their resources, like lobbying, building political action committees and sponsoring fund-raising events. Some executives have complained that it is harder to justify the expense of large contributions to shareholders because the membership fees of the parties' most elite donor clubs have outpaced the rate of inflation, jumping this year to $250,000 from $100,000 .</p>
        <p>Executives at other corporations that sponsored parties and receptions this week said they believed the events were most effective at marketing the corporate brand names to conventiongoers.</p>
        <p>Providing 400 vehicles to the host committee is ''a great product exposure opportunity for us,'' said William Noack, a G.M. spokesman attending the convention. ''We also do it for the Olympics and events like that.''</p>
        <p>THE REPUBLICANS: THE MONEY  Correction:  August 5, 2000, Saturday  A picture caption yesterday about Bush family members at the Republican National Convention misidentified a sister-in-law of George W. Bush. She was Margaret Bush, the wife of Marvin Bush -- not Columba Bush, the wife of Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 8, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Friday about Bush family members who attended the Republican National Convention misstated the occupation of Marvin Bush, the former president's son, and the location of his business. He is a co-founder of an investment firm in McLean, Va., not a management consultant in Texas.</p>
