        <p>Visitors to Blockbuster stores on Sept. 1 may be startled to notice kiosks displaying DirecTV, which beams movies by satellite. Why would the country's largest provider of videocassettes open the door to a competing type of movie delivery? Several types, in fact.</p>
        <p>Late this year or early next, Blockbuster plans to dispense movies via TiVo, a digital service in California that can serve up films in the home through a device placed on television sets.

        <p>Visitors to Blockbuster stores on Sept. 1 may be startled to notice kiosks displaying DirecTV, which beams movies by satellite. Why would the country's largest provider of videocassettes open the door to a competing type of movie delivery? Several types, in fact.</p>
        <p>Late this year or early next, Blockbuster plans to dispense movies via TiVo, a digital service in California that can serve up films in the home through a device placed on television sets. Last month, Blockbuster announced a deal with Enron, a Houston company, to supply movies on a video-on-demand basis over fiber optic lines and high-speed digital subscriber lines, or D.S.L's.</p>
        <p>Moves like these could obviously be stirred into doomsday scenarios for the video store, which some analysts say will go the way of the dodo once people can get the movies they want with a click. John Antioco, Blockbuster's chairman, predicts no such disappearance for stores but said he did see a time eventually when customers could receive ''the full Blockbuster experience basically online without having to leave their home.''</p>
        <p>In the future, he said, stores will act as supplying agents, so to speak, for a mix of services in a vastly broadened video scene that will include traditional rental and sale of cassettes and especially DVD's (already approaching 10 percent of the video market), pay-per-view via satellite and digital cable, and video on demand from the Internet.</p>
        <p>TiVo and Enron are carriers. Blockbuster supplies content. It is not yet clear how extensive the new service will be. Mr. Antioco refers to ''Blockbuster on demand.'' And what is ''video on demand,'' beyond vague jargon? ''One minute you want to watch a movie and 15 seconds later you can be,'' Mr. Antioco said. Stores can't satisfy that, of course, nor can anyone else. Blockbuster's initial D.S.L. inventory will be about 200 films, he said. Later, greater broadband and Internet access will speed things considerably.</p>
        <p>But, he added, stores needn't be shut out. Blockbuster outlets, he said, will be selling products like DirecTV, high-speed D.S.L. connections and video-on-demand services connected to the Web. Much of that can be ordered from home, of course, but it seems you'll still be able to leave the house.</p>
        <p>Delayed Success</p>
        <p>Whatever new technology takes hold, studio accountants can't fault the videocassette. In its weekly list of 40 best renters, Video Business magazine compares movies' video revenue to their theater box-office take. For big theater titles like ''The Green Mile'' or ''American Beauty,'' the box office outstrips video rental, but when it comes to smaller films, especially those with some critical acclaim that may have been missed during their theater runs, the cassette takes over.</p>
        <p>For example, after 10 weeks in stores, ''Boys Don't Cry'' had taken in $17.5 million in rentals versus $3.7 million in theaters. After 11 weeks, ''Mystery, Alaska,'' a worthy sleeper, has taken in $9 million in theaters but almost $20 million on tape. And ''Girl, Interrupted'' took seven weeks on video to pass its theater run, $30 million to $29 million.</p>
