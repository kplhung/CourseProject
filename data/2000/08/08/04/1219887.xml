        <p>The beginning of ''Hollow Man'' is witty enough. An innocent rat skitters along the floor of an apparently empty steel cage toward a dish of water, only to be snatched up and devoured by an unseen predator, whose voracious maw is outlined in the hapless rodent's blood while the rest remains invisible. Cut to Kevin Bacon in his apartment, burning the midnight oil in front of his computer. He stops to do to a Hostess Twinkie what the spectral animal (who turns out to be a gorilla named Isabelle) has just done to the rat, and then his computer screen, which has been performing some kind of 3-D molecular modeling, flashes a dire warning: ''STATUS: UNSTABLE.''</p>
        <p>Yes indeed. In short order we discover that Mr. Bacon's character -- a scientist named Sebastian Caine, head of a top-secret, Pentagon-financed research project -- is a peeping tom, a self-pitying egomaniac and a very difficult co-worker. How Hollywood mad scientists have changed since the days of white lab coats and heavy black-rimmed glasses! Sebastian drives a sleek silver Porsche and wears a half-length black leather coat that would make Shaft jealous. Your tax dollars at work, folks.</p>

        <p>The beginning of ''Hollow Man'' is witty enough. An innocent rat skitters along the floor of an apparently empty steel cage toward a dish of water, only to be snatched up and devoured by an unseen predator, whose voracious maw is outlined in the hapless rodent's blood while the rest remains invisible. Cut to Kevin Bacon in his apartment, burning the midnight oil in front of his computer. He stops to do to a Hostess Twinkie what the spectral animal (who turns out to be a gorilla named Isabelle) has just done to the rat, and then his computer screen, which has been performing some kind of 3-D molecular modeling, flashes a dire warning: ''STATUS: UNSTABLE.''</p>
        <p>Yes indeed. In short order we discover that Mr. Bacon's character -- a scientist named Sebastian Caine, head of a top-secret, Pentagon-financed research project -- is a peeping tom, a self-pitying egomaniac and a very difficult co-worker. How Hollywood mad scientists have changed since the days of white lab coats and heavy black-rimmed glasses! Sebastian drives a sleek silver Porsche and wears a half-length black leather coat that would make Shaft jealous. Your tax dollars at work, folks.</p>
        <p>Dr. Caine and his team -- which includes his ex-girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and her current beau (Josh Brolin), as well as a movie-diverse assortment of specialists -- are at the cutting edge of a burgeoning new science making stuff invisible, or, more precisely, causing living creatures to ''phase shift out of quantum sync with the visible universe.'' This involves injecting the subjects with a bright blue serum, which first induces seizures and then the gradual disappearance of their bodies, one layer at a time.</p>
        <p>We first see the process in reverse with Isabelle, whose bones, organs, and muscles slowly come into view as she writhes on a gurney. Before long, in response to pressure from the doddering generals who control his financing, the impatient Sebastian decides to become the first human to undergo the process.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bacon, well known for his willingness to appear nude in films, strips down, quite literally, to nothing. Luckily the lab is well-stocked with infrared goggles, allowing the still-visible scientists to keep track of their elusive boss. Later on they whip up some latex to help him look almost human, or at least like a half-melted Kevin Bacon Halloween mask.</p>
        <p>A lot of work has clearly gone into the special effects in ''Hollow Man,'' which uses the latest computer-generated imagery to update the cinematic obsession with invisibility that dates at least to James Whale's ''Invisible Man'' in 1933. (It also uses some tried and true film techniques, including that scary movie staple, the bad guy's point-of-view shot.) Actually, according to the production notes, ''Hollow Man'' belongs to an even older tradition, since ''the theme of invisibility is familiar in premodern narrative,'' figuring prominently, for example, in the second book of Plato's ''Republic.'' And that's not all: ''From 'The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus' to H. G. Wells's 'The Invisible Man,' '' the notes elaborate, ''the idea of invisibility has been a source of wonder and curiosity, and will doubtless remain so until the day it becomes a reality.'' Doubtless.</p>
        <p>But if you're looking for wonder, or even passable entertainment, you'd do better to curl up with Plato -- or with the latest work of literary scholarship from Columbia's publicity department -- than to endure the long, slow, unraveling of this movie, which can't even muster the intelligence to be pretentious or the bravado to be amusingly bad. This is a shame, since the director, Paul Verhoeven, can usually be counted on for lurid thrills or for splashy special-effects sublimity.</p>
        <p>''Hollow Man'' has neither the ripe atmospherics of ''Basic Instinct'' or ''The Fourth Man'' (the kinky Dutch sex thriller that earned Mr. Verhoeven a ticket to Hollywood) nor the full-throttle excitement of ''Total Recall'' or the first ''Robocop.'' It even lacks the howling shamelessness that has turned ''Showgirls'' into a cult favorite among connoisseurs of guilty video pleasure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Verhoeven and the screenwriter, Andrew W. Marlowe, have taken what could have been a fascinating, creepy psychological thriller and turned it into a labored, implausible piece of action-movie hack work. Once nobody can see him -- and once he no longer has to look at himself in the mirror -- Sebastian becomes intoxicated with the power and freedom that his new state confers. The best part of the movie tracks his rapid slides from petulant narcissism into demented evil.</p>
        <p>He sneaks up on the high-strung veterinarian (Kim Dickens) and unbuttons her top while she sleeps and then quickly and with a minimum of soul-searching descends from hide-and-seek pranks to raping his neighbor, spying on Linda and taking out his frustrations on a helpless invisible dog.</p>
        <p>But instead of exploring the underside of Sebastian's personality, or the tantalizing liberty that invisibility might offer, ''Hollow Man'' quickly becomes a pallid retread of ''The Terminator'' crossed with a half-dozen second-rate horror movies, as his fellow scientists pursue Sebastian through their mazelike underground compound and he dispatches them in the most predictable order possible.</p>
        <p>Fire extinguishers, bags of human blood and a sprinkler system provide occasions for some show-offy effects as Mr. Bacon's unclothed frame is outlined by computer-enhanced mist and moisture. At the very end, for reasons doubtless having to do with the finer points of quantum synchronization, Mr. Bacon takes on the appearance of a very angry anatomical model, all veins and muscles and popping eyeballs, that has escaped from a medical school classroom to take revenge on humanity -- or to steal one last kiss from his old flame. Some things are better left unseen.</p>
        <p>''Hollow Man'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nudity -- -- some of it visible with the aid of infrared lenses -- graphic violence, and cruelty to invisible animals.</p>
