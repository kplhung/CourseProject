        <p>With the focus of the political world on Philadelphia, Representative Rick A. Lazio yesterday dined on kosher pizza in Brooklyn, did some radio interviews, raised some money, then planned to head home to Long Island.</p>
        <p>Around 10 p.m. (''hopefully back home by that time,'' he said) he expected to click on the television and watch Gov. George W. Bush of Texas accept the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>Such mundane plans on such a pivotal night for Republicans should not be construed as a slight, the Senate candidate said yesterday, as he has all week, in response to questions about his relative absence from the Republican National Convention.</p>
        <p>Never mind that the national convention tends to be the place to be seen, and most Congressional candidates eagerly sought speaking time, however brief or low-key. Mr. Lazio declined an invitation to make a short speech outside of prime-time television viewing hours. He spent just one day, Tuesday, at the convention; he drew a lot of attention -- some of it focused on his short stay -- and pronounced it enough.</p>
        <p>''I think it's terrific to be cheered by party faithful,'' Mr. Lazio said yesterday, referring to the 50 seconds of applause Tuesday night when William Powers, the chairman of the New York Republican Party, mentioned his name on the convention floor during a roll-call vote.</p>
        <p>''But I need to be on the streets of New York, I need to be reaching out,'' he said, ''talking to people, answering their questions. I have absolutely no regrets.''</p>
        <p>Advisers to Mr. Lazio were split on whether he should accept an invitation to speak -- outside of prime time -- or make a longer appearance than a day, given that many people still do not know who he is.</p>
        <p>But some analysts said Mr. Lazio made the most of it, given that he is a Republican running in a predominantly Democratic state.</p>
        <p>''This is a very different convention,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican political consultant. ''But still, if you want to transcend partisanship, you do not go to partisan activities. That said, if there was a convention to go to, this was it. This is the most gentle convention. I call this the politics of pleasantry. I don't think Lazio would be hurt by attending.''</p>
        <p>While conceding that Mr. Lazio ''possibly'' could have raised more money in Philadelphia, Dan McLagan, his chief spokesman, said he had no shortage of interviews. Mr. Lazio conducted more than 25 of them in recent days, Mr. McLagan said, including some with national outlets.</p>
        <p>In many of those interviews, however, Mr. Lazio was asked about his absence from the convention. He reiterated his position that he would garner more votes being in New York than in Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>He did keep a low-wattage schedule. In addition to the interviews with television and radio outlets, he attended several private fund-raisers.</p>
        <p>After visiting Amnon's Kosher Pizza in Borough Park, Brooklyn, yesterday to shake hands, be photographed eating pizza and speak to reporters, he met privately with Borough Park community leaders and did a round of radio interviews.</p>
        <p>Today, however, he makes a bid for a news media splash with his first campaign appearance with John McCain, the senator from Arizona who challenged Mr. Bush for the nomination. Some members of Mr. McCain's former staff, including Mike Murphy, now work for Mr. Lazio.</p>
