        <p>The unexpected race to replace the late Senator Paul Coverdell has become a contest between two of the best-known names from Georgia's political past, both of whom are nearing 70 years old.</p>
        <p>Late Wednesday, former Senator Mack Mattingly became the leading Republican in the race after Lewis Jordan, an airline executive, announced that he would not run. Mr. Mattingly, 69, will face former Gov. Zell Miller, 68, a Democrat who was recently appointed to fill Mr. Coverdell's seat until the Nov. 7 election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coverdell, 61, a Republican, died of a brain hemorrhage on July 18. Gov. Roy Barnes persuaded Mr. Miller to assume the seat last week, hoping that Mr. Miller's lingering popularity with voters would keep lesser-known Republicans from entering the race.</p>
        <p>The strategy worked -- a large group of the state's Republican congressmen spent 10 days wrestling with the risk of giving up safe seats  to challenge Mr. Miller, and none decided to make the race. Party leaders turned to Mr. Mattingly, hoping his name recognition would help raise money quickly to compete against Mr. Miller's head start.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mattingly, who served one term in the Senate before being defeated in 1986, was never as popular in the state as Mr. Miller. National Republican leaders urged the state party to hold out for a younger, more forceful candidate, which led to Mr. Jordan's brief interest.</p>
        <p>Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said earlier this week that Mr. Jordan was the stronger candidate because he was willing to spend $3 million on the race. In a television interview, he said Mr. Mattingly could not win, and would not get any financial help from the national party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jordan, 56, was the founder of ValuJet Airlines, which later changed its name to AirTran Airways. He has spent the week in Philadelphia at the Republican National Convention, hoping to win over Georgia's delegation. But given Mr. Mattingly's firm decision to run, Mr. Jordan was eventually convinced  that having two Republicans on the ballot would increase Mr. Miller's chances of winning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mattingly said in an interview today that he was persuaded to run by Republicans around the state who said Mr. Coverdell should have a  conservative successor. He acknowledged, however, that raising money and getting the national party to lend its support may be difficult because of the unplanned nature of the race.</p>
        <p>''This is a 50-yard dash, a three-month race, but you manage with the  cards that have been dealt,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The special election is technically nonpartisan, with no party affiliations listed on the ballot. Three other lesser-known candidates have also entered the race, and if no one gets more than half the vote, there will be a runoff between the top two candidates on Nov. 28.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mattingly, a member of the party's conservative wing, ran a lackluster re-election campaign in 1986, for which he apologized six years later in a letter to supporters. ''I am not a good politician,'' he said in the letter, written when he was briefly considering another run for the Senate.</p>
        <p>He decided not to run for the Senate that year, saying he did not feel committed to the race, and has otherwise kept a low political profile. In 1987, he was named NATO's assistant secretary general for defense support, and in 1992 President George Bush appointed him to be ambassador to the Republic of Seychelles. Last summer, he became a paid lobbyist for the defense contractor Lockheed Martin, urging former colleagues in the Senate to help preserve the company's $65 billion F-22 stealth fighter.</p>
        <p>Chuck Clay, the chairman of the state Republican Party, said he was relieved that the party had settled on a single candidate, but made it clear he was aware of the difficult road ahead for Mr. Mattingly.</p>
        <p>''Hey, there ain't no perfect candidate, but at least we're all behind one candidate now,'' Mr. Clay said.</p>
