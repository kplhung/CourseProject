        <p>Next Stop, Bratislava</p>
        <p>CARL SPIELVOGEL is going to Slovakia, but too late to see his wife's traveling exhibit. It is on the way to Milan.</p>
        <p>President Clinton named Mr. Spielvogel, an advertising executive, to be ambassador to Slovakia yesterday. His wife, BARBARALEE DIAMONSTEIN-SPIELVOGEL, is an author and the head of the private, nonprofit Historic Landmarks Preservation Center. Her exhibit (on New York and Chicago) began at the New-York Historical Society and went on to Chicago and Paris. Then, because Mr. Spielvogel had been nominated to the ambassadorship, the exhibit went to Slovakia.</p>

        <p>Next Stop, Bratislava</p>
        <p>CARL SPIELVOGEL is going to Slovakia, but too late to see his wife's traveling exhibit. It is on the way to Milan.</p>
        <p>President Clinton named Mr. Spielvogel, an advertising executive, to be ambassador to Slovakia yesterday. His wife, BARBARALEE DIAMONSTEIN-SPIELVOGEL, is an author and the head of the private, nonprofit Historic Landmarks Preservation Center. Her exhibit (on New York and Chicago) began at the New-York Historical Society and went on to Chicago and Paris. Then, because Mr. Spielvogel had been nominated to the ambassadorship, the exhibit went to Slovakia.</p>
        <p>But his nomination was tied up in Washington, and under State Department rules, he could not go to Slovakia until he was confirmed or appointed. That happened yesterday when the president used a recess appointment, which does not require confirmation by the Senate, to give him the job. That ended a year of waiting that began with a deal that released another hold, on the nomination of Richard C. Holbrooke as American ambassador to the United Nations. In return, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took Mr. Spielvogel and two other nominees ''hostage.'' At issue was an unrelated personnel dispute between SENATOR CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, an Iowa Republican, and the State Department that was settled last week.</p>
        <p>A Strip House That's Wholesome</p>
        <p>The Strip House is not a strip joint, the restaurateur PENNY GLAZIER says.</p>
        <p>With her husband, PETER, Mrs. Glazier bought Asti's, a restaurant at 13 East 12th Street that began as a speakeasy during Prohibition. Legend has it that Franklin D. Roosevelt drank illegal martinis there before he was governor of New York. The Glaziers decided to remodel (though the 1,200 photographs of opera singers will remain) and rename the restaurant.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the new neon sign went up. Mrs. Glazier, standing on the sidewalk, was amused by the questions from passers-by who thought it was being made into an X-rated establishment. When Mrs. Glazier told them that the name is a play on words because the chef, DAVID WALZOG, is known for strip sirloin, there were those who chuckled and those (men, she said) who seemed disappointed.</p>
        <p>''Early on,'' Mrs. Glazier said, ''I did a focus group with women of various ages who loved the name and thought it was fun and appropriate for a restaurant on 12th Street, so I decided, let's do it.''</p>
        <p>Singer Is Arrested</p>
        <p>CARLY SIMON posted $250,000 bail for one of her backup singers in a cocaine case, The Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>The backup singer, JOHN FORTE, was charged with conspiring to distribute cocaine. He was arrested at Newark International Airport last month. Prosecutors said that Mr. Forte, 25, referred to the cocaine as ''ice cream'' in telephone conversations they recorded. Federal agents arrested him after he was handed a suitcase by two women.</p>
        <p>'Stargazer' for Sale</p>
        <p>The gateway to the Hamptons is for sale.</p>
        <p>The artist LINDA SCOTT -- who built ''Stargazer,'' a 56-foot-tall sculpture that sits in a field alongside Route 111 in Manorville -- wants to sell her signature piece because she no longer has the time or money to keep it up. The price: $500,000.</p>
        <p>The red-metal sculpture was commissioned nine years ago as an entryway for the Animal Rescue Fund in East Hampton. But town officials decided it would distract pilots landing at the East Hampton Airport and declared it an illegal sign.</p>
        <p>Moving it cost Ms. Scott $20,000; building and maintaining ''Stargazer'' has cost her about $250,000 in personal funds and outside donations.  Four years ago it was vandalized, and she had to repair it. ''It's as if the guy who did the Statue of Liberty every few years had to go and paint and stucco it,'' Ms. Scott said. ''I'm its dedicated indentured servant. I just want to do some great work and not be a maintenance person.''</p>
