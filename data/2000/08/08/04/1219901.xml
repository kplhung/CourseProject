        <p>With each stop, the final destination of the M23 bus became clearer. Some passengers got on with golf clubs, others with hockey sticks, a few with bowling balls. We were trundling to Chelsea Piers, the once-crumbling Hudson River docks that in 1995 opened as a self-proclaimed athletic paradise.</p>
        <p>''This is like the bus to camp or something,'' said my son Roy, 12.</p>
        <p>My wife, Suzanne O'Keefe, and I had taken Roy and his brother, Guy, 9, to try a little bit of everything. The boys bubbled with happiness as they contemplated bowling, ice-skating, in-line skating, gymnastics, golf, baseball-batting and divinely greasy hamburgers. Suzanne struggled valiantly to be cheerful, although her plans to melt blissfully at the Origins Feel Good Spa while her male folk playfully perspired were not to be. The spa is booked months in advance.</p>
        <p>''Maybe for Christmas we can send Mom to the spa,'' chirped Guy in his typically sweet style.</p>
        <p>But immediately upon arriving, Suzanne, at least by brave appearances, had left her mud-wrap aspirations behind. As an architect, she was fascinated by the piers, which this newspaper called ''the most remarkable urban design achievement of their day'' when they opened in 1910. The new piers replaced a hodgepodge of run-down waterfront structures with a magnificent row of grand buildings embellished with pink granite facades. The original architect was Warren &amp; Wetmore, designers of Grand Central Terminal.</p>
        <p>Chelsea Piers was where the Titanic was going, and where the Lusitania left for the last time. Millions of immigrants came here to catch ferries to Ellis Island. Soldiers embarked here for the battlefields of World Wars I and II. It was a grand, historic place. Giant pictures on the wall show Jesse Owens leaving for the Olympics, politicians hyperbolizing, longshoremen praying and, best of all, Gloria Swanson, hands on hips, looking breathtakingly stunning.</p>
        <p>But cargo and passenger ships got bigger and went elsewhere, planes changed the very concept of oceanic crossings, and the once-proud Chelsea Piers slipped into a place for the Police Department to store barricades, the Traffic Department to impound stolen cars and the Sanitation Department to repair trucks. Wind whistled through broken windows.</p>
        <p>Then, in the 1990's, a group of businessmen identified the piers as a place where they could move the crowded Sky Rink, one of Manhattan's rare indoor ice rinks, from a nearby building. The state said it would issue a lease only for all of the expansive Chelsea Piers, not some fraction of it. There were many starts and stops, and not a few pitfalls, but the result was a 30-acre athletic complex, including a gleaming new Sky Rink, this one with two separate rinks.</p>
        <p>The new Chelsea Piers, for all its sporty polish and $120 million in costs, is not grand. The gorgeous granite was inexplicably removed in the 1960's to make way for a steel front. Suzanne thought the huge murals attached to the front were, at best, pedestrian. In general, it seemed that a shiny utilitarianism (the badge of the new century?) had trumped aesthetics.</p>
        <p>The concession is intended to help pay for a five-mile-long public park that is finally being built on Manhattan's western edge. Some park lovers thought that the public should pay in full for the park, not make perhaps Faustian deals with a developer who might walk away at the end of its lease. Others resented Chelsea Piers' expanding parking in areas where operators had promised to plant grass. Still others, and there are many, think the prices for the various recreations are simply too expensive for an amenity built by and for all New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>But some of the strongest park advocates insist that converting dilapidated warehouses into a sports mecca added up to powerful evidence that the tattered Hudson River waterfront could be something far better than the sinkhole it had become.</p>
        <p>''This was the camel's nose under the tent,'' said Tom Fox, who as head of the state-city agency that administered park planning in the early years negotiated the deal with Chelsea Piers.</p>
        <p>''Chelsea Piers gives a great push to the waterfront,'' agreed Albert Butzel, who led a coalition of citizens' groups to push for the park.</p>
        <p>Let the Games Begin</p>
        <p>The place feels throbbingly alive. You dodge bikes and baby strollers along the pedestrian path that slices through the complex. You can watch cases of wine being loaded onto the yachts moored to the piers. You can sunbathe on benches in the way-too-small public park area at the end of the northern pier.</p>
        <p>And yes, you can spend lots of money, not altogether unlike the drunken sailors who prowled these docks before they were parking lots. We bought four of the Chelsea Piers silver passports for $35 each. Each is good for admission to all attractions (except the Sports Center) and for a variety of discounts. For example, you get $15 worth of tee time at the Golf Club, skate rental for both ice and roller rinks, and so on. A gold passport, for $60 (for ages 16 and older only), includes all of the above and the Sports Center, too.</p>
        <p>But the passport has its limits. For example, at Chelsea Piers Lanes, the passport paid only for shoe rental. Each game was $7. Still, bowling was our first stop.</p>
        <p>''We're a good bowling family, right?'' Guy asked as we put on our shoes. Well, darned tooting! Particularly because we voted not to remove the bumpers that line the alleys, making it impossible to throw a gutter ball.</p>
        <p>At the adjacent alley, a group of teenagers in wheelchairs were bowling. We reasoned that they were better, or at least more confident, than we because they were using real gutters. We quickly learned that the correct word was better.</p>
        <p>Not to say we are not competitive among ourselves. With no possibility of throwing a gutter ball, I rolled a 93. The scores then trended downward to Roy's 89. ''I could have won,'' Roy sobbed. Guy stared at the ground sullenly, thinking about his own agony of not winning.</p>
        <p>Naturally, we played another game. Roy scored 100 and was very gracious. ''It's O.K., Guy,'' he said, in the insincere manner that comes so easily to victorious big brothers. ''Don't feel bad.''</p>
        <p>Guy clenched his little fists and growled: ''I'm not a sore loser. I could have won this game.''</p>
        <p>Virtual Reality Games</p>
        <p>We were then unable to escape the computer, pinball and virtual reality games that the bowling place had so thoughtfully provided. We were smart to have bowled first. ''Jake,'' the father next to us was pleading, ''they called us. Please, let's bowl.''</p>
        <p>Roy played a game called California Speed, a crazed fantasy of a car race that began with a bikini-clad beauty waving a green flag. Within seconds, he was careering down the wrong side of a busy highway and tearing through the aisles of a shopping mall where he cheerfully upended armies of screaming pedestrians. When he finished at 2:17.57 minutes, more bikini-clad women appeared to applaud. ''I told you I'm good at this game,'' Roy said.</p>
        <p>But did he feel no remorse at being the ultimate mall rat? ''How could I not kill them, Dad?'' he asked. ''They were just standing there, screaming! What am I supposed to do?''</p>
        <p>Oh. Before we could properly discuss what a cool idea it would be to buy a transparent bowling ball with a realistic-looking human skull inside, we were gone. Lunchtime.</p>
        <p>Other than snack bars, the two main places to eat at Chelsea Piers are a smoky brew pub called Chelsea Brewing Company and a diner known as Miss Rita's Burgers and Barbecue. We went with Miss Rita, which was attractively decorated with rusty license plates, steer skulls and pictures of scantily clad cowgirls.</p>
        <p>Good burgers cooked perfectly to order, beneath a sign decreeing, ''No cussin', lyin' or spillin'.'' Also a sassy waitress, who finally interrupted a man who asked a barrage of culinary and nutritional questions by shouting, ''Hey, this is a burger joint!''</p>
        <p>Properly fortified, we made our way to the Golf Club. Here is how the Chelsea Piers brochure describes the place: ''With 52 heated and weather-protected hitting stalls on four levels, a computerized automatic ball tee-up system and a 200-yard, net-enclosed artificial turf fairway, the Golf Club at Chelsea Piers is the most technologically advanced golf driving range and teaching center in the United States.''</p>
        <p>The miracle begins with being in a parking lot on Pier 59 and realizing you are looking at a quaint clapboard golf clubhouse. There is a large putting green and faux Victorian gas lamps. Inside are lush deep-green carpets and tasteful framed black-and-white pictures of great golfers. Roy and I planned to hit some balls. For $15 (the amount on our silver passports), you get 65 at busy times and 94 at nonpeak hours. Suzanne and Guy retired to the putting green.</p>
        <p>Tiger Woods, Beware</p>
        <p>The 52 stalls are heated and covered. They are stacked on four levels in the manner of a driving range in Japan, where land is dear and golf is king. What comes next is mind-boggling: you stick a card in a slot. Immediately, the little plastic tee in front of you disappears into the ground. A second later, it emerges with a ball on top. You don't even have to bend over to tee up!</p>
        <p>We both hit better than we thought we would. We stuck in another card. We were surrounded by the constant, surreal sound of balls falling through pipes so they could reunite with their tees. Roy and I thought this was really, really fun.</p>
        <p>We found Suzanne and Guy at the practice green. A chauffeur in a BMW was parked beside it. Guy was giggling and chasing the ball around like a chubby little polo pony. ''Isn't Guy doing well?'' his big brother inquired. Just then, Suzanne sank a 20-foot putt.</p>
        <p>Next we went to the Field House, an 80,000-square-foot building with the city's largest gymnastics training center, two hardwood basketball courts, two artificial-turf playing fields for indoor soccer and lacrosse, four batting cages, a dance studio and areas for martial arts and other sports. We first hit the batting cages. Roy did well, and I managed to get hit in the hand with a ball.</p>
        <p>Our next experience was the boys' favorite. Called recreational gymnastics, it is available several times each weekend. Kids roughly the age of ours were supervised as they tried a lot of gymnastic stuff and ended up climbing a 30-foot-high artificial-rock wall. A session divides into 40 minutes of warm-ups and gymnastics and 40 minutes of rock-climbing. To make sure of places, visitors can make reservations by calling (212) 336-6500.</p>
        <p>The instructor, Susan Edward, began the session by asking the children to run in a circle, then suddenly ordered them to freeze. They immediately dissolved into piles of laughter. ''I love how everyone is listening,'' Ms. Edward said. The funny thing was, she was right.</p>
        <p>The children took turns jumping from a trampoline into a pit filled with strips of plastic foam. They swung on a rope into another pit. Roy just lolled around in the foam after one rather spectacular fall, wearing an expression of pure joy. Then he burrowed underneath to hide. That, in essence, turned out to be the whole idea.</p>
        <p>''We want them to have a good time, so they maybe come back and learn the high-level stuff,'' Ms. Edward said.</p>
        <p>Guy worked like a beaver on the parallel bars, even though he was clearly afraid of the height. ''You're so strong, I can't believe it,'' the instructor said. Guy said, ''Thanks,'' and quickly added, ''I'm not doing it again.''</p>
        <p>Then, at Ms. Edward's suggestion and my kids' cheerleading, it was my turn to swing from the rope. ''You jump in the pit and, like, say goodbye to stress,'' she said. Boy, was she right. It worked the second time, too.</p>
        <p>Then came the wall. The boys were strapped into harnesses. Roy scampered almost to the top. ''No, it's not scary,'' he said. ''It's fun . . . yeah, it's fun.'' Guy worked hard but could barely get off the ground. ''I'm going to work out and come back and do better,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To me, it looked awfully difficult, not to mention high. I watched most respectfully.</p>
        <p>Where Falling Is Fun</p>
        <p>Back to the batting cages, just a few feet away in the field house. Roy really whacked the ball this time. I sneaked out for a minute to visit the Sports Center at Chelsea Piers, an expansive and daunting health club that boasts a quarter-mile running track and a 10,000-square-foot rock-climbing wall. This physical fitness citadel is as expensive as the other attractions: if you haven't bought a gold passport, a one-day pass is $50 on weekends, $40 on weekdays. And children are not welcome. (Models, movie stars and their look-alikes are obviously another story.)</p>
        <p>We watched a soccer game on the indoor field and concluded that it would be easier than an outdoor one because you could bounce the ball off the walls. Guy got to kick a ball around between games and was happy as a clam.</p>
        <p>Then something quite beautiful happened. We went ice-skating. Suzanne, Roy and Guy skate every week in the winter. I don't because I never learned, am miserable on skates and am a card-carrying party pooper, if my blood kin can be believed. But mainly, I am terrified.</p>
        <p>On shaking ankles, I edged onto the ice. I clenched the edge of the wall. ''Ready for this, Doug?'' Suzanne asked, almost as if she thought it were funny.</p>
        <p>''I could be hitting golf balls,'' I growled.</p>
        <p>Slowly I edged along, grimly gripping the side with both hands. As Roy and Suzanne skated off, Guy came over and wordlessly grabbed my hand. He went round and round with me, slowly. After a while, I was able to let go of the wall sometimes.</p>
        <p>I stopped. Before skating off, Guy said: ''Tell me when you've got enough rest. Don't go without me. I'm ready any time to take you around.''</p>
        <p>And he did. At the end, he asked, ''Did you have fun falling, Dad? I was just wondering if you had fun or were scared to death, or what?''</p>
        <p>Part of the answer was obvious. The other part was that it felt oddly comforting to be taken care of by my 9-year-old son. He helped me to a bench where I could remove my skates. Suddenly, Roy screamed the unmentionable: ''Dad! Are you ready for Rollerblading?''</p>
        <p>Next time, for sure. (Right.) I left thinking that as much as Chelsea Piers represents the suburbanization of my city, it is a great place for a day with the family. It was expensive, but this is, after all, New York City. And there is so much to do on those four piers.</p>
        <p>But enough is never enough for a tweenager. ''I think they should build at least three more piers,'' Roy said.</p>
