        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>GLIMMERGLASS OPERA. This is the weekend to see all four productions that Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown is offering during its 25th-anniversary summer season. Tomorrow afternoon there will be another performance of the much-anticipated production of John Philip Sousa's operetta ''The Glass Blowers,'' the first production of the complete Sousa work since its 1913 premiere. A new edition, based on original sources, has been prepared by Jerrold Fisher and William Martin. Running throughout the frothy score is, not surprisingly, a rousing march tune that keeps turning up in different guises. Christopher Alden is the director and John DeMain conducts. Tomorrow night you can take in Puccini's indestructible ''La Boheme.'' Tonight brings another performance of Strauss's ''Salome,'' directed by Leon Major, with the soprano Elizabeth Byrne in the daunting title role. And on Sunday afternoon there will be Handel's rarely staged ''Acis and Galatea,'' sung in English, directed by the always imaginative Mark Lamos. ''Salome,'' today at 8 p.m.; ''The Glass Blowers,'' tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.; ''La Boheme,'' tomorrow at 8 p.m.; ''Acis and Galatea,'' Sunday at 2 p.m. Alice Busch Theater, on Route 80 eight miles north of Cooperstown, N.Y. Tickets: $45 to $90 (50 percent youth discounts available). Information and tickets: (607) 547-2255 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>

        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>ASTON MAGNA. The early-music scene in the Northeast has long shifted between New York and Boston, and what better middle ground is there in the summer than the Berkshire Hills? (Just ask the Boston Symphony Orchestra and New York listeners, who meet annually at Tanglewood.) Although this festival needs no particular excuse to turn its attention to Bach, the composer died 250 years ago, and this final weekend is devoted entirely to his sacred and secular cantatas (Nos. 54, 118b, 201 and 203), featuring the delightful ''Singing Contest Between Phoebus and Pan.'' Daniel Stepner, a violinist and the artistic director, leads the small orchestra, and the singers include Jane Bryden and Jeffrey Gall. Tomorrow night at 6, St. James Church, off Main Street, Great Barrington, Mass., (413) 528-3595. Tickets: $20 at the door; $18.50 in advance; $16 for students and the elderly. The program is also to be presented tonight at 8 at Bard College, Route 9G, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (914) 758-7425. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and the elderly (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. There is no better place in New York City to experience chamber music with the proper intimacy than at the concerts presented by Bargemusic, the rewarding weekly series that takes place on an acoustically ideal and commodious barge in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge. And the performers are always first-rate. Tonight and tomorrow night the superb pianist Randall Hodgkinson plays a recital of works by Chopin and Prokofiev. On Sunday afternoon, the pianist Edward Auer, the violinist Christiaan Bor, the violist Marcus Thompson and the cellist Ronald Thomas play a program of Beethoven, Schumann and Dohnanyi. Enjoy the music with a spectacular view of Lower Manhattan. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, Brooklyn. Today at 7:30 p.m., tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m. Tickets: $27 regular admission; $25 senior citizens; $15 students. For reservations, call: (718) 624-4061, or 624-2083 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>BERKSHIRE CHORAL FESTIVAL. This attractive event gathers singers from around the country, even the world, to work on choral masterpieces with noted conductors and prepare a concert performance. Here the festival concludes its season with Jane Glover, the conductor of the London Choral Society and the Huddersfield Choral Society in England, leading the festival chorus and the Springfield Symphony Orchestra in Elgar's ''Dream of Gerontius.'' The vocal soloists are Marietta Simpson, Jon Garrison and John Cheek. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Berkshire School, Route 41, Sheffield, Mass., (413) 229-1999. Tickets: $20 to $28 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>BRIDGEHAMPTON CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL. Musicians generally seem to be drawn to the woods and the mountains when they want to combine music making and summer vacations, but the flutist Marya Martin gambled that her colleagues would be equally happy to perform in range of a beach. She has regularly attracted fine players to her festival in Bridgehampton, and her programs have been solid and sometimes inventive. That said, the program the festival is offering this weekend is staid if undeniably pleasant: it brings together Mendelssohn's exquisite Octet and the chamber version of Copland's ''Appalachian Spring.'' Sunday at 6:30 p.m., the Bridgehampton Presbyterian Church, Montauk Highway, Long Island, (631) 537-6368. Tickets: $25, $20 for the elderly. (Selections from the program are also being offered at a benefit concert to raise money for the festival, tomorrow evening at 6:30 at the Atlantic Golf Club. Tickets: $750 to $10,000, with various benefits) (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>CARAMOOR FESTIVAL. Tonight the popular guitarist Manuel Barrueco and Friends offer one of the most eclectic programs of the summer season at the Caramoor International Music Festival in Katonah, N.Y. The program includes nods to popular culture by two younger American composers: Aaron Jay Kernis's ''100 Greatest Dance Hits'' and Michael Daugherty's ''I Loved Lucy.'' There will also be works by Harrison, Robert Beaser and Chick Corea. Sunday afternoon the Vermeer String Quartet offers works by Haydn and Smetana and, joined by the pianist Vladimir Feltsman, the Brahms Piano Quintet in F minor. Tomorrow, all day and in the evening, will be another installment of the Caramoor Jazz Festival. Manuel Barrueco and Friends, tonight at 8, the Spanish Courtyard, tickets $25. Caramoor Jazz Festival, all day tomorrow starting at 2 p.m. in the Venetian Theater, tickets $40. Vermeer String Quartet and Vladimir Feltsman, Sunday at 4:30 p.m., the Venetian Theater, tickets $35 and $25. Caramoor International Music Festival, Katonah, N.Y. Directions and tickets: (914) 232-5035 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>DENNIS KEENE CHORAL FESTIVAL. Record buyers as well as New York concertgoers are familiar with Dennis Keene's impressive work as choral conductor of the Voices of Ascension. Here, in his third annual festival, Mr. Keene oversees an institute for singers and choral conductors from around the country, and some of the results are put on display in public concerts. Tomorrow the noted choral specialists Susanne Peck and Peter Bagley and conducting fellows of the institute lead the Charis Chamber Ensemble and the Keenefest Chamber Chorus in ''A Chamber Choir Celebration.'' On Sunday, Mr. Keene and conducting fellows lead the festival orchestra and chorus in a program of Mozart, including the Requiem and the ''Coronation'' Mass. Tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., St. Joseph's Chapel, Kent School, Route 341 West, Kent, Conn., (860) 927-5563. Tickets: tomorrow, $10; Sunday, $20 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>MARLBORO FESTIVAL. Part festival, part training camp for aspiring and accomplished young musicians from Curtis, Juilliard and other conservatories, Marlboro has a special atmosphere of collegiality and love of the art. The current season is its 50th, and it has a lot to celebrate, not least the stewardship of its new co-directors, the exceptional pianists Richard Goode and Mitsuko Uchida. In the public concerts, faculty and students share the stands in most of the ensembles. At the first of two concerts this weekend, Stephanie Houtzeel, a mezzo-soprano, will sing Ravel's exquisite ''Sheherazade,'' with the pianist Ken Noda and the flutist Paula Robison accompanying. Also on the bill are the string sextet version of Schoenberg's ''Verklarte Nacht'' and Brahms's Piano Quartet in G minor (Op. 25). The program on Sunday opens with Ravel's ''Chansons Madecasses,'' sung by James Martin, a bass, with Ms. Robison, the cellist Peter Wiley and Alain Planes, a pianist, as the accompanying ensemble. Janacek's Quartet No. 1 and Schubert's Octet round out the concert. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Marlboro Music Festival, Marlboro, Vt. (802) 254-2394. Tickets: $5-25 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>MAVERICK CONCERTS. This enterprising chamber music series, now in its 85th season, offers concerts in an open-sided barn where the sounds of nature and the music of man interact freely. This weekend's offerings include a piano recital by Ian Hobson and a concert by the Bachmann-Klibanoff-Fridman Trio. Mr. Hobson's program includes two big Sonatas -- Schubert's in C minor and Rachmaninoff's in B flat minor, played in its original version -- as well as works by Schumann and Benjamin Lees. The Bachmann-Klibanoff-Fridman Trio will play Haydn's Trio in C (XV:27), Mendelssohn's Trio in D minor (Op. 49), Turina's Trio in B minor (Op. 76) and Paul Schoenfield's ''Cafe Music.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m. (Mr. Hobson) and Sunday at 3 p.m. (the Bachmann-Klibanoff-Fridman Trio). Maverick Concerts, Maverick Road between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., just outside Woodstock, (914) 679-8217. Tickets: $15, $5 for students (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL. This event, popular since its inception 34 years ago, has evolved to supplement the familiar orchestral concerts with all manner of other programs. Tonight and tomorrow night it is the tried and usually true, as Gerard Schwarz, the music director, conducts the festival orchestra in works including Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 9, with Alicia de Larrocha as soloist, and Schoenberg's Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra, with the Tokyo String Quartet. As no small bonus, the Tokyo performs Shostakovich's First Quartet in a preconcert recital at 7. On Sunday, for something different, the violinist Itzhak Perlman oversees a program by students of the Perlman Music Program. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $28 to $48 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. In a nice festive gesture, the orchestra goes to the movies this weekend. Tonight, Takao Kanayama conducts a ''Salute to Hitchcock,'' with excerpts from films including ''To Catch a Thief'' and ''North by Northwest.'' Tomorrow, Hans Graf conducts Prokofiev's masterly score for Eisenstein's classic ''Alexander Nevsky'' to accompany a showing of the film. Here the orchestra is joined by Jill Grove, a mezzo-soprano, and the Choral Arts Society of Washington. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Wolf Trap, 1624 Trap Rd., Vienna, Va., (703) 218-6500. Tickets: $15 to $32 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. Attending the New York Philharmonic's free outdoor concerts has become a summer ritual, and since the advent of the Carlos Moseley Pavilion, with its updated sound system, listeners can appreciate the nuances of the performances, not just the sheer power. For the second of the orchestra's two programs, Delta David Gier is to conduct Bernstein's ''Candide'' Overture, Gershwin's ''American in Paris'' and Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite, and Philip Smith, the Philharmonic's principal trumpeter, is to be the soloist in the flashy Arutunian Trumpet Concerto. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Westchester Community College, Valhalla, N.Y., (212) 875-5709. Admission is free (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>NORFOLK CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL. The Yale Summer School of Music retreats north to this lovely spot, and the public reaps much of the benefit at concerts in the quaint Music Shed. This weekend presents a contrast in musical styles. Tonight the Barbara Carroll Duo plays jazz. Tomorrow the pianist John O'Conor and the Vermeer Quartet look for folkish roots of another sort in a program of Czech music: Dvorak's ''American'' Quartet and Second Piano Quintet, and Smetana's First String Quartet (''From My Life''). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860) 542-3000. Tickets: $12 to $30; $5 for ages 18 to 25; free to those under 18 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA. As part of its summer residency at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Charles Dutoit, will present a concert tomorrow night that includes the world premiere of a violin concerto titled ''Fool's Paradise'' by the American composer Richard Danielpour, with Chantal Juillet as soloist. Mr. Danielpour has won popularity with audiences for his lushly scored, harmonically accessible orchestral works, including a cello concerto written for and recorded by Yo-Yo Ma. Mr. Danielpour's brand of Neo-Romanticism has been less well received by some critics. That said, he writes effectively for instruments, and Ms. Juillet, a young Canadian, has been attracting attention. The program also includes the overture to Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' and Orff's ''Carmina Burana.'' Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Tomorrow at 8:15 p.m. Tickets are $20-50; $13 for lawn seats. Call SPAC phone charge: (518) 587-3330, or Ticketmaster: (518) 476-1000 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>PIANO SUMMER. The pianist Vladimir Feltsman directs this international institute and festival, with concerts, recitals and master classes. Here Mr. Feltsman turns a hand to conducting, leading the festival orchestra in the intermezzo from Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony and a performance by Oxana Mikhailova-Mackoff, the winner of a piano competition presented by the festival. Tonight at 8, McKenna Theater, State University College at New Paltz, 75 South Manheim Boulevard, (845) 257-3904. Tickets: $22 and $25 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>SKANEATELES FESTIVAL. As many of the other festivals wind down, it may be time to dig out the map and start exploring. Tucked away in Skaneateles, near Syracuse, this adventurous festival is directed by Diane Walsh, a pianist. In the first program of the season, Ms. Walsh plays Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, with Grant Cooper conducting the festival orchestra. The program also includes Grieg's delightful ''Holberg Suite.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Brook Farm, Route 41A, south of Skaneateles, (315) 685-7418. Tickets: $15 and $20; free to those under 13 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>TANGLEWOOD. Tonight at 8:30 Seiji Ozawa conducts an all-Tchaikovsky program: the ''Pathetique'' Symphony and the First Piano Concerto, with Van Cliburn. Tomorrow, also at 8:30, John Williams conducts an evening of film music, including Copland's score for ''The Red Pony.'' On Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Mr. Ozawa returns to the podium to lead a performance of Britten's ''War Requiem'' with an outstanding lineup of soloists: Christine Goerke, Anthony Dean Griffey and Thomas Quasthoff. In the evening, once more at 8:30, there is jazz with Andre Previn and friends. (888) 266-1200. Tickets: $13.50 to $85, Tanglewood, West Street, Lenox, Mass. (Paul Griffiths).</p>
