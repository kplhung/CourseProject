      <abstract>
        <p>Thomas L Friedman Op-Ed column says Vice Pres Al Gore is not going to be able to use Gov George W Bush's lack of knowledge about world affairs against him in this election since Bush has surrounded himself with team of foreign policy wise men and wisely separated himself from the true isolationists among Congressional Republicans (M) unilateralism and by playing on fact that Bush wise men are all wise in ways of a world gone by, but there are probably few voters who care (M)</p>

        <p>Give George W. Bush credit. He may still believe that the Greeks are Grecians.

        <p>That's over.

        <p>Give George W. Bush credit. He may still believe that the Greeks are Grecians. He may still leave the impression that he has not read the World section of the newspaper for the last 20 years. But it doesn't matter, and Al Gore is not going to be able to use W.'s global gap against him in this election.</p>
        <p>That's over. Because if the Bush team has been good at disguising the true, merciless underbelly of the Republican Party's domestic policies, it has been absolutely brilliant at disguising the fact that your average T.W.A. pilot knows more about the world than the Republican nominee for president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has overcome his global gap through two strategies. First, by cloaking himself in the A-team of Republican foreign policy wise men. It's hard for Mr. Gore to keep asking  ''Would you turn the nation's car keys over to this kid?'' when Mr. Bush has Dick Cheney as his nanny, Colin Powell riding shotgun and Brent Scowcroft, George Shultz and Henry Kissinger all advising from the back seat. True, Mr. Bush's likely national security adviser, Condi Rice, gave a cliche-ridden speech to the convention that declared, in the same breath, that America under Mr. Bush would not be the world's 911 or global cop and that America under Mr. Bush would lead the world in a way Bill Clinton did not. But hey, the A-team will sort that out by November.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has also deftly blunted Mr. Gore's attacks by separating himself from the true isolationists among Congressional Republicans. There is a hard core of Republicans in Congress whose motto on foreign policy could be summed up as ''Stupid and proud of it'' or ''Dumb as we wanna be.'' This is the crowd that favors everything from nonpayment of U.N. dues to further cuts in foreign aid to outright isolationism. But when Mr. Bush forcefully repudiated Republican Congressional efforts to fix a September 2001 deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Kosovo, it was the sort of adult, commander-in-chief-style move that nullifies Mr. Gore's charge that Mr. Bush's global gaps will be filled by ''the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership.''</p>
        <p>So is there any path left for Mr. Gore to gain traction on foreign policy? Well, if you assume that the public still cares a whit about foreign policy in this age of prosperity, then the most fruitful attack Mr. Gore might make on Mr. Bush would not be for his isolationism, but for his unilateralism. For instance, to listen to the Bush advisers, they are going to just tell Russia, China and the NATO allies they have to accept a scrapping of the ABM treaty and U.S. missile defense plans. Like it or lump it. Such unilateralism is either going to blow up the alliance, and trigger an arms race with Russia and China, or it is going to lead to an embarrassing backdown by the Bushies, if they get in office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore could also play on the fact that the Bush wise men are all wise in the ways of a world gone by. The Republicans like to stress that they are into power geopolitics -- issues with hair on them -- while Democrats are caught up in the soft stuff, the stuff that the first Bush administration labeled ''globaloney,'' such as the environment, AIDS, debt relief, population control. The truth is, this globaloney will probably kill us long before a North Korean missile does, but there isn't a single senior Bush adviser who has written anything interesting on the subject.</p>
        <p>But there probably aren't two voters who care. In which case, Mr. Gore might have to acknowledge that we live in an era when Americans are obsessed with personal opportunity, not national security. And the key to enhancing personal opportunity is keeping the Clinton economic expansion going, and stressing the biggest national security issue for people today -- which is education. Mr. Bush has smartly pressed the education button, but he's vulnerable on the economy. He has no reassuring economic wise men, and his tax-cut numbers don't add up.</p>
        <p>Maybe Mr. Gore should counter Bush-Cheney-Powell with his own triumvirate: Al Gore, Bob Rubin and whomever Mr. Gore chooses for V.P. In an age when people are more worried about the Nasdaq than NATO, one Rubin equals two Powells. If Mr. Gore has any hope, it's by projecting Mr. Bush as a man who hasn't been reading the business section of the paper, not the World section. That World section thing won't work anymore -- not when most Americans haven't been reading it either.</p>
