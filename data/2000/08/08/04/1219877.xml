        <p>Judy Chicago's ''Resolutions: A Stitch in Time,'' an installation at the American Craft Museum, is an excellent candidate for worst New York museum show of the year.

The spirit, unlike that of, say, Barbara Kruger, is not adversarial; rather, the mood is weirdly cheerful, like a visual art version of Up With People.

        <p>Judy Chicago's ''Resolutions: A Stitch in Time,'' an installation at the American Craft Museum, is an excellent candidate for worst New York museum show of the year. Ms. Chicago's first solo venture in New York since 1987 and first museum show since her famous ''Dinner Party'' installation was exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum 20 years ago, this show is aesthetically vacuous, conceptually inane and morally disingenuous.</p>
        <p>Like ''The Dinner Party,'' a vast, triangular table with place settings designed to memorialize great women of the past, ''Resolutions'' is the product of collaboration between Ms. Chicago and a group of craftswomen. This time it is mainly a picture show, and the focus has expanded to embrace a whole basket of liberal, humanist values. The spirit, unlike that of, say, Barbara Kruger, is not adversarial; rather, the mood is weirdly cheerful, like a visual art version of Up With People. The 19 easel-size compositions look like posters produced by a group of unimaginative but eager-to-please high school students for a small-town community center.</p>
        <p>The pictures are arranged in seven thematic groups: Family, Responsibility, Conservation, Tolerance, Human Rights, Hope and Change. Each combines a familiar verbal slogan and a bland, cartoonish illustration that calls to mind the deliberately generic style of Mark Kostabi but without any of his mordant cleverness. In the Family category, we have ''The hands that rock the cradle shape the world,'' with two mothers flanking a baby in a cradle; the image of a proud graduate in cap and gown rises up behind them like a prophetic dream. In Tolerance we have wolves and sheep reaching out to each other in peace and the slogan ''Live and let live.'' And Hope offers ''Hitch your wagon to a star,'' with the image of a family of hopeful African-Americans driving an old wooden wagon within the decorative framework of a star.</p>
        <p>The only thing that makes these works at all worth looking at is the embellishment added by Ms. Chicago's collaborators. For each piece, a woman skilled in some form of needlework enhanced Ms. Chicago's drawn and painted design through embroidery, needlepoint, macrame, petit point, applique, quilting or some other technique. At best, as in ''Home Sweet Home,'' in which all sorts of dwellings -- an igloo, a teepee, a wood-framed house, a high-rise apartment building -- encircle a globe, embroidery by Pamella Nesbit gives the otherwise vapid picture a satiny, jewel-like richness. (In a sidebar to the exhibition proper, a series of didactic text panels describes the various techniques used and includes enthusiastic comments from each of the collaborators.)</p>
        <p>The installation is set up as a spiral, the sequence of pictures ultimately leading to a life-size statue with a beige plastic surface. The figure is bald and has abstracted features, but its conical, dresslike lower half suggests it is female. She holds out muscular maternal arms and has an embroidered valentine heart embedded in her chest, gold at the center with a purple and red halo. Colorful embroidery spirals up around her dress parallel to words in different languages routed into the surface. In English the words say, ''Find it in your heart.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Chicago's project is not, after all, without a coherent and even audacious vision. Almost always when modern art has addressed social issues, it has done so negatively from the point of view of the romantically alienated individual, seldom offering an image or a program to inspire communities of optimism and good will. Against this background it may be radical to promote a message of love, peace and understanding, and to do so through collaboration with nonartists using popular crafts.</p>
        <p>But it is hard to imagine an intelligent viewer taking seriously the bromides asserted by Ms. Chicago's glorified posters. Of course, she knows she is dealing with cliches, and part of her purpose is to bring back to life certain basic human values that Postmodern-style irony has lost sight of. Nothing she does, however, gives exhortations like ''Get into the swing of things'' or ''Do a good turn'' any social, political or moral urgency. You have to wonder if Ms. Chicago herself really believes in these sentiments. There is a feeling of condescension, like that of an insensitive schoolteacher talking down to children.</p>
        <p>And then there is the feminism. Though not specifically feminist in its general aims, the ''Resolutions'' project emerges from the same feminist thinking that gave rise to ''The Dinner Party'': against patriarchal privileging of high art and masculine genius it pits domestic, traditionally female crafts and shared labor (with Ms. Chicago nevertheless receiving star billing). Nonhierarchical, cooperative and noncompetitive effort is put forth as the way to make a better world.</p>
        <p>Some people may still like this 1970's-style feminism, while others will find it old-fashioned and naive. In any event, the actual dispiriting experience of the ''Resolutions'' project does not make a good case for the theory's practical viability.</p>
        <p>Long ago Ms. Chicago made some beautiful airbrushed mandala paintings, and some of the dishes she designed for ''The Dinner Party,'' whether or not you liked the gynecological iconography, were seductively lush. But her messianic ambitions have taken her far beyond the limits of her real artistic competence.</p>
        <p>''Resolutions: A Stitch in Time'' will remain at the American Craft Museum, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, through Sept. 3.</p>
