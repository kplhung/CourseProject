      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The singer Daryl Sherman and the pianist Dave McKenna have a lot more in common than the fact both happen to come from Woonsocket, R.I. Both are staunch jazz traditionalists whose music looks back to 1930's and 40's prototypes. In their new show at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, the pair (but especially Ms. Sherman) project a kind of willful innocence.</p>
        <p>The emotional essence of much traditional jazz is a pure, untrammeled happiness and faith that life's greatest joys reside in simple pleasures. And in their delightful but too-long show, the two bring this philosophy to life.</p>

        <p>The singer Daryl Sherman and the pianist Dave McKenna have a lot more in common than the fact both happen to come from Woonsocket, R.I. Both are staunch jazz traditionalists whose music looks back to 1930's and 40's prototypes. In their new show at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, the pair (but especially Ms. Sherman) project a kind of willful innocence.</p>
        <p>The emotional essence of much traditional jazz is a pure, untrammeled happiness and faith that life's greatest joys reside in simple pleasures. And in their delightful but too-long show, the two bring this philosophy to life.</p>
        <p>A devoted and erudite student of jazz history, Ms. Sherman is a stylistic compendium of Billie Holiday (the sultry, lingering phrasing), Blossom Dearie (the wispy little-girl tone) and Mildred Bailey (the steady swing underpinnings and aura of unshakable optimism). Even when singing a sad song she allows the pleasure of the music to outweigh the pain of the lyrics, and you sense a silver lining just ahead.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenna isn't quite as sunny. An emphatic, no-frills technician, he takes his time to build up a head of rhythm. But when his musical engine is going full throttle, his bedrock blues-based pianism conveys a spare, rumbling majesty.</p>
        <p>The duo's show, which runs through Aug. 12, focuses on the many composers and performers who celebrated their centennials this year and last. In his solo segment, Mr. McKenna concentrates on the music of Duke Ellington, emphasizing its blues roots. The high point of Ms. Sherman's set is a sweetly swinging ''Memphis in June,'' a bucolic dream of Southern languor by Hoagy Carmichael and Paul Francis Webster that she entwines with the vocal equivalent of honeysuckle.</p>
