        <p>There is plenty of laughter in Marc Maron's ''Jerusalem Syndrome,'' but this unusual theatrical concoction by one of the leading practitioners of alternative comedy in New York City is not a joke. Ambiguity is expected of Mr. Maron: one reason he and a few like-minded comics adopted the label alternative in the mid-1990's was to signal audiences that they were not quick-laugh artists like most stand-up comics. Mr. Maron in particular has often explored fairly sophisticated ideas in sizzling exchanges with his audience. But ''Jerusalem Syndrome'' takes his approach into very different territory.</p>
        <p>He performed an early version of this work last year at P.S. 122 as part of a citywide comedy festival. It involved stringing together several riffs he had first tried in comedy clubs into a unified story. He and his director, Kirsten Ames, have continued working on it, and the Off Broadway production by the Westbeth Theater Center is clearly meant to invite recognition of it as a new form of alternative theater. Whether as comfort to him or as reassurance to his fans, Westbeth has kept a hint of the club setting, with viewers drinking at crowded tables and brain-shattering music preceding the show. But this show is a long way from the stand-up clubs and even from Mr. Maron's favorite haunt, the Luna Lounge.</p>

        <p>There is plenty of laughter in Marc Maron's ''Jerusalem Syndrome,'' but this unusual theatrical concoction by one of the leading practitioners of alternative comedy in New York City is not a joke. Ambiguity is expected of Mr. Maron: one reason he and a few like-minded comics adopted the label alternative in the mid-1990's was to signal audiences that they were not quick-laugh artists like most stand-up comics. Mr. Maron in particular has often explored fairly sophisticated ideas in sizzling exchanges with his audience. But ''Jerusalem Syndrome'' takes his approach into very different territory.</p>
        <p>He performed an early version of this work last year at P.S. 122 as part of a citywide comedy festival. It involved stringing together several riffs he had first tried in comedy clubs into a unified story. He and his director, Kirsten Ames, have continued working on it, and the Off Broadway production by the Westbeth Theater Center is clearly meant to invite recognition of it as a new form of alternative theater. Whether as comfort to him or as reassurance to his fans, Westbeth has kept a hint of the club setting, with viewers drinking at crowded tables and brain-shattering music preceding the show. But this show is a long way from the stand-up clubs and even from Mr. Maron's favorite haunt, the Luna Lounge.</p>
        <p>The title is a name given by psychiatrists to a delusion of some visitors to the Holy Land that they are biblical prophets or divine emissaries. On the face of it, the thought of God acting through Mr. Maron -- who for years has trumpeted a respect for religion that is decidedly inferior to his knowledge of it, which is nil -- is funny enough to get a laugh without being mentioned. And the show's theme, the spiritual journey of a radical materialist, is a good framework for Mr. Maron's fanciful recollection of his life, beginning with a college flirtation with a beatnik cult.</p>
        <p>His examination of the Beat phenomenon as religion, with sacred texts, established rituals and even pilgrimages (''any car ride with music and no destination'') is not only good comedy but also astute criticism, and a poem about visiting Jack Kerouac's grave is excellent parody. And if cocaine addiction in Hollywood seems a detour on his journey, he does get a real spiritual insight from it: ''When you hear voices, it is never one, but many, and you spend a lot of time getting them to pick a leader.''</p>
        <p>The high point of his quest is a visit to a cigarette factory. Mr. Maron's reflection on brand loyalty as a commitment of faith leads to a hilarious litany of corporate emblems enshrined in the modern pantheon of stuff. But real revelation comes in the tobacco works, where workers all along the assembly line smoke the product of their craft, as does Mr. Maron onstage throughout this show. In most religions heaven is an eternal life of fulfillment of people's deepest desires, and to Mr. Maron the factory is paradisical: ''This is what socialism should have been!''</p>
        <p>But the search disintegrates in Israel, in part because his conceit of merging with a camcorder is awkwardly intrusive, but in part by design. His vision of ending a hopeless peace process and inviting the Disney Company to turn Jerusalem into the peaceful heart of a heavenly kingdom is vintage Maron. But his confrontations with extremely religious Jews at the Western Wall is a jolt. He says he grew up in a Jewish family in which religion was almost never mentioned, and through his life it never touched him. In Israel it cannot be avoided, and he seems nervous about that. He does not express distaste for the practices of some of the people he mimics at prayer; he says, ''I don't like them.'' Every glance and gesture telegraph his discomfort and suggest he is talking about a part of himself he does not want to recognize.</p>
        <p>In club acts this man was the specialist in alienation; his ferocious assaults on assertive audience members, driven by a formidable intellect, can spread waves of discomfort all around him. Suddenly he is the alien, facing himself as an alien. He is clever enough to make this hapless self-awareness amusing, but under it is a murmur of sadness that makes the audience restless. Throughout the performance there is a slightly unnerving suggestion that he would like some understanding, and in the last segment that he could use some warmth. A warm hug was never his metier unless he had a stiletto up his sleeve, and this new persona is a bit alarming.</p>
        <p>It is as if in his search for a new form he has returned to the old Italian idea of commedia, as Dante used it or as Pirandello did: life is ridiculous, but not always to those living it. If ''Jerusalem Syndrome'' falters as theater, it is because Mr. Maron has not created a clearly defined character for him to inhabit and be transformed by. Audiences as well as actors are brought to life by roles, which they cooperate in endowing with a soul. If he can ever step outside himself far enough to invent such a role, or if he can find a collaborator who can write one, he and his audience will find out at once if he is an actor. Here he has taken a step that makes me hope he will take the leap.</p>
        <p>JERUSALEM SYNDROME</p>
        <p>A one-man show written and performed by Marc Maron; directed and developed by Kirsten Ames; sets by Jessica Krause; lighting by Roy Trejo; sound by Gregory Kostroff. Presented by Westbeth Theater Center, Arnold Engelman, producing director. At 151 Bank Street, West Village.</p>
