        <p>The cost to the Pentagon for sending an array of weapons and other military equipment for an exclusive viewing by members of Congress and their guests as they were gathering for the Republican National Convention is in at more than half a million dollars.</p>
        <p>A decision by Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen to approve the display of military might -- despite a Pentagon policy forbidding military involvement in partisan politics -- prompted criticism from Democrats and even some within the military.</p>
        <p>The display -- including a Marine V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft, an Army unmanned aerial vehicle and a tank from the Pennsylvania National Guard -- spent three days at the Philadelphia Naval Yard. The display came down on Monday, but even today some Navy personnel were still breaking down the show.</p>
        <p>The Army spent the most: $280,000.</p>
        <p>The Air Force estimated its costs at $100,000, while the Marine Corps said it had spent only $35,000. The Navy, which sent the least equipment, reported an unusually precise estimate of $246,796.</p>
        <p>Was it worth the costs? Because the shipyard was closed to the public, the services reported relatively few people saw the display -- as few as 25 delegates, according to Air Force estimates. As luck would have it, though, there was a convention of firefighters at the shipyard last weekend, and they made up most of the visitors.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 5, 2000, Saturday  An article yesterday about the Pentagon's costs for shipping military equipment to a display near the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia misstated the amount spent by the Navy. It was $146,796, not $246,796.</p>
