        <p>For 14 months after Amy Watkins died with a knife in her back on a tree-shaded sidewalk in Brooklyn, David Jamison managed to escape the notice of dozens of detectives hunting for her killer.</p>
        <p>He cut off his dreadlocks. He apparently spoke little about the crime. He spent nine months in Pennsylvania until returning to Prospect Heights, the neighborhood in Brooklyn where, the police say, he killed Ms. Watkins in a botched robbery in 1999, leaving behind the $8 in her pocket.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jamison's undoing began in May, with the arrest of a 37-year-old woman -- identified by investigators as his sister -- in two bodega robberies in Sheepshead Bay, law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>While the woman, Geneva Jamison, said nothing to the authorities about her younger brother, the officials said her arrest set in motion a series of events that led detectives to arrest Mr. Jamison on Wednesday, accusing him of plunging a large carving knife into Ms. Watkins's back on March 8, 1999.</p>
        <p>After Geneva Jamison's arrest, the officials said, someone who knows her and her brother made a remark about the killing of Ms. Watkins within earshot of an informer for the police.</p>
        <p>The informer eventually persuaded the person to whom the remark was made to go to the police with the information. That information, coupled with a call to the police Crime Stoppers line, prompted the detectives to focus on Mr. Jamison.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Jamison, 27, who the police said admitted to his role in the killing and told investigators he bought the knife in Chinatown, was arraigned in Criminal Court in Brooklyn on a charge of first-degree murder, for which he could face the death penalty. He was also charged with first-degree robbery and weapons possession. Judge Joseph McKay ordered him held until a bail hearing on Aug. 10.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Jamison standing before the judge in an oversize white T-shirt and baggy black pants, Michael Vecchione, the first deputy assistant in the office of the Brooklyn district attorney, said the killing was a ''crime of opportunity.''</p>
        <p>''Amy Watkins was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' said Mr. Vecchione, adding that Mr. Jamison and his co-defendant, Felix Rodriguez, 20, set upon her ''to satisfy their need for a small amount of money, stabbing her with a knife that went virtually all the way through her body.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Watkins, 26, had come from Kansas to attend the Hunter College Graduate School of Social Work. In court yesterday, Mr. Vecchione called her ''an angel among us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez, whose sister is Mr. Jamison's girlfriend and the mother of his 3-year-old daughter, was also held pending an Aug. 10 hearing. He was arraigned before Judge John Carter in a separate courtroom on charges of second-degree murder, first- and second-degree robbery and weapons possession.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jamison's lawyer, Jonathan D. Sims, acknowledged that his client had had brushes with the law, but said they resulted in a single misdemeanor drug conviction, for which Mr. Jamison completed his probation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sims said he planned to ''vigorously challenge the authenticity'' of Mr. Jamison's confession, especially ''how the confession was elicited by the police,'' but he would not elaborate.</p>
        <p>Since his probation on the drug charge, Mr. Sims said, his client ''had been on the right track.'' Outside the courtroom after the arraignment, Mr. Vecchione said, ''He certainly didn't take the right track that night.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jamison and Mr. Rodriguez and a third suspect, Pierre Antoine, 26, met at least five years ago when two of Mr. Rodriguez's sisters were dating the other two men, some of their friends and family members said. Mr. Jamison lives with Tanya Rodriguez, together with their child.</p>
        <p>The men's friendship blossomed as Mr. Jamison -- who friends said was known as Sinister or Sin -- and Mr. Antoine played basketball in the Dean Street Park, not far from where Ms. Watkins was killed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Antoine, who, according to Mr. Jamison's statement to police, fled after the robbery with the purse Ms. Watkins was carrying, was released yesterday to officials of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, who said they would begin proceedings to deport him, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Antoine, who was held on an old petty larceny warrant from Schenectady, N.Y., and was questioned in the killing for about 24 hours, was born in Haiti, family members said. He grew up in Brooklyn, graduating from high school there and winning a basketball scholarship to Schenectady County Community College, but he dropped out after a conviction on drug charges, family members said.</p>
        <p>Detectives said they believed that Mr. Antoine served as a lookout in the attack, but the only evidence they have against him is from the other men, and under New York State law, that is not enough to win a conviction, authorities said. After he completed a six-month shock-incarceration sentence for his drug conviction, immigration authorities could have moved to deport Mr. Antoine, but state parole officials and his family said they did not.</p>
        <p>At the arraignments yesterday afternoon, Ms. Watkins's father and stepmother -- Lawrence and Gail Watkins -- watched and maintained their composure, until they spoke with reporters outside the courtroom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins said of watching the two men in court: ''My first feeling was breaking down. I realized I was looking at the last men to see my daughter. They don't even seem to be men at all -- they looked like boys.'' He was crying.</p>
