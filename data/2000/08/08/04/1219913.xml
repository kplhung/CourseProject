        <p>Letter from Frank, Tom and Kate Lowenstein, children of Allard K Lowenstein, says July 31 article on the conditional release of his killer did not do justice to the case for retaining his in-patient status</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your July 31 front-page article ''Voices in His Head Muted, a Killer Rejoins the World,'' about the man who killed our father, former Representative Allard K. Lowenstein, in 1980, was unfair.</p>
        <p>It did not mention that the New York State commissioner of mental health as well as the Manhattan district attorney opposed conditional release of the killer, and that significant testimony was offered by two psychiatrists who supported the retention of his in-patient status.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your July 31 front-page article ''Voices in His Head Muted, a Killer Rejoins the World,'' about the man who killed our father, former Representative Allard K. Lowenstein, in 1980, was unfair.</p>
        <p>It did not mention that the New York State commissioner of mental health as well as the Manhattan district attorney opposed conditional release of the killer, and that significant testimony was offered by two psychiatrists who supported the retention of his in-patient status.</p>
        <p>Indeed, given the strong case presented for retention, and the fact that all agree that there are no guarantees with this condition, it seems only logical that every effort should be made to ensure that continued oversight and monitoring can be fully enforced.</p>
        <p>Further, the article included irrelevant allegations about our father's personal life. Given that there has been no mention of this in the court record in the last 20 years, and that it served no purpose in the article's overall focus, the inclusion of such gossip was inappropriate.</p>
        <p>It is a shame that the article made no attempt to present our father as a human being. It is important to remember that, beyond being a public figure involved in the civil-rights and antiwar movements, he was a person who cherished life and gave his family immeasurable gifts of love, wit and wisdom, and that his loss came at an unfathomable cost to him and those who loved and cared about him.</p>
