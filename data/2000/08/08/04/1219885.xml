        <p>If nothing else, the television movie ''One Kill'' offers the most unusual language of love.</p>
        <p>''The day I enlisted my life fell into place,'' whispers a Marine captain, an attractive blond woman, as she kisses a male superior officer. As the captain becomes more aroused, she moans, ''I had something to aim for. Duty, honor weren't words, but something I could do.''</p>
        <p>The major sighs, ''I used to dream about girls like you -- in high school.''</p>
        <p>Alas, this seemingly perfect match ends up with him dead and her defending herself against a murder charge and a military conspiracy (of course). Viewers must defend against unconvincing characters, murky storytelling and a barrage of cliches. Yes, a pack of reporters thrusts microphones in the captain's face when she goes to trial. Yes, the night before she testifies, she sits at a table and downs a glass of whiskey.</p>
        <p>Anne Heche does what she can (not much) with the part of Mary Jane O'Malley, the captain. Shelley Evans has written a character who may be morally and maternally impeccable. (Her children, by a former husband, frolic with her and cutely call her Captain.) But she is also impenetrable. It's hard to imagine what lies behind her Mona Lisa smiles and self-righteous pronouncements. (''I don't make deals with my principles,'' she says.)</p>
        <p>She isn't popular with the men under her command, though it's hard to understand why, exactly, from this scenario (except that they, too, may find her obnoxiously smug). She seems to be the only woman doing actual soldier's work on the base. The only other military women are a clerk and the prosecutor.</p>
        <p>The movie wants to make a feminist stand, about the unfair treatment of women in the military, but seems too tired to put up much of a fight. It also capitalizes in an unseemly way, given its message, on Ms. Heche's body, with many peeks at her wearing her underwear and less, during a sex scene. The movie, based on a real case, makes Captain O'Malley the victim of an anti-female cover-up, by a Marine establishment bent on protecting the dignity of her dead lover, a Vietnam veteran with 35 years of service. But the filmmakers unwittingly created a dramatic obstacle to their polemic by casting Sam Shepard as the major whom O'Malley kills in self-defense. Unlike Ms. Heche, who seems trapped within the narrow confines of her character, Mr. Shepard has a craggy charisma that implies depth where there may not be any. You feel some sympathy for him, another middle-aged man unhinged by hot sex with a younger woman, even as his behavior becomes erratic and then dangerous toward Captain O'Malley.</p>
        <p>The movie is billed as a thriller, but its pulse is weak. It does have one astute line, uttered by Eric Stoltz, playing Captain O'Malley's lawyer: ''This case doesn't have any heroes, captain. Nobody likes it.''</p>
        <p>INFLUENCES  Bravo, Sunday night at 7:30</p>
        <p>It's difficult to pin down the genesis of creativity, but that's the ambition of ''Influences,'' a new half-hour series on Bravo. Each week, after an ingratiating introduction by Alan Alda, television writers, directors, actors and comedians discuss what motivated them. The program is also produced by the Museum of Television and Radio, so television shows are the dominant source of inspiration. Parents, however, aren't ignored. (''All it would have taken is one hug from my father and I'd be an accountant,'' says Ray Romano, the comedian and star of ''Everybody Loves Raymond.'')</p>
        <p>In the premiere, the least interesting of the first few shows in the series, Tracey Ullmann pays homage to -- not surprisingly -- Lucille Ball, Mary Tyler Moore and Lily Tomlin, from her ''Laugh-In'' days. Ted Danson reveals that he grew up in a house without television.</p>
        <p>But the old television clips are fun to watch, especially unfamiliar shows like ''Price of Tomatoes,'' a 1962 television play starring Peter Falk, that was momentous for the actress Tyne Daly. ''He just leaped out of the television set and grabbed me,'' she says of Mr. Falk's performance.</p>
        <p>John Lithgow gives credit to Shakespeare and Milton Berle, whereas Susan Lucci, who has spent most of her life playing the duplicitous Erica Kane on ''All My Children,'' found ''The Donna Reed Show'' important. ''I saw that things were too polite,'' she says, preferring ''I Love Lucy.''</p>
        <p>''That seemed better to me,'' Ms. Lucci says. ''They weren't so polite to each other.''</p>
        <p>ONE KILL  Showtime, Sunday night at 8</p>
        <p>Written by Shelley Evans; directed by Christopher Menaul; music by Eric Allaman; Matthew Herath and Wendy Wilson, co-producers; Michael Storey, director of photography; Jacques Michel Bradette, production designer; Joel S. Rice, executive producer.</p>
        <p>WITH: Anne Heche (Mary Jane O'Malley), Sam Shepard (Maj. Nelson Gray), Eric Stoltz (Capt. Walker Randall), Kate McNeil (Maj. Leslie Nesbitt), Bill MacDonald (Col. Sam Doran), Sean Bell (Lt. Tim Macey), Carl Marotte (Hap O'Malley), Max Morrow (Harry O'Malley) and Charlotte Arnold (Callie O'Malley).</p>
