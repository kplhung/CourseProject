        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your Aug. 1 news item about a judge's delay of the demolition of a house once occupied by Edgar Allan Poe:</p>
        <p>New York University can do nothing without the shrill voices of Greenwich Village community activists hurting my ears. A case in point is the litigation a few gadflies have pursued against the university for plans to demolish a house where Poe lived for about two years, probably less.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your Aug. 1 news item about a judge's delay of the demolition of a house once occupied by Edgar Allan Poe:</p>
        <p>New York University can do nothing without the shrill voices of Greenwich Village community activists hurting my ears. A case in point is the litigation a few gadflies have pursued against the university for plans to demolish a house where Poe lived for about two years, probably less.</p>
        <p>The historic value of the building has already been demolished. It has undergone major renovations since the mid-19th century. If Poe went back there today, he wouldn't recognize his own home.</p>
        <p>Maybe N.Y.U. is too big and faceless. But the activists try to thwart even modest accommodations the university tries to make for its students. They relish their role as spoilers even when the merits of the issue are not on their side.</p>
        <p>MIKE AMON  Brooklyn, Aug. 2, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is editor in chief of Washington Square News, N.Y.U.'s daily student newspaper.</p>
