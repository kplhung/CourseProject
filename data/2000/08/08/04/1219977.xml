        <p>One of the oldest firms in the business of managing money for wealthy families, the Bessemer Trust Company, will announce today that it is buying the private-client and institutional-equity groups of a rival, Brundage, Story &amp; Rose, executives of the firms said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Neither of the firms, which are privately held, would disclose the terms of the deal. But executives of the firms said the deal would add $4.5 billion in assets under management and about 800 clients to Bessemer, which has $33 billion under management and 1,300 clients.</p>
        <p>Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette said yesterday that it was buying the other of Brundage, Story's three units, its institutional fixed-income division with $3.3 billion in assets under management. The terms of that deal were also not disclosed.</p>
        <p>With the transactions, the Brundage name will disappear from Wall Street 68 years after the firm was founded.</p>
        <p>''This transaction is significant in that it allows Bessemer to gain size and scale,'' said Henry McVey, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst.</p>
        <p>''The reality,'' he said, ''is that many of the large commercial and investment banks are now pushing into this market, and the independent players need to bulk up.''</p>
        <p>In January, Charles Schwab &amp; Company said it would buy the U.S. Trust Company, and just last month Alliance Capital Management, which is controlled by the French financial services holding company AXA Group, bought Sanford C. Bernstein.</p>
        <p>Guy Moszkowski, a financial analyst at Salomon Smith Barney said, ''This is another manifestation of the need to be at a certain minimum scale to maximize your economics in an environment where more technology investment is needed every day.''</p>
        <p>Francis S. Branin, the chief executive of Brundage, Story, acknowledged that size was an issue. ''We felt that longer term, it was probably going to be more and more difficult for medium-size firms like ours to compete across a broad range of services,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Besides investing its clients' money in blue-chip stocks like General Electric, Intel and Home Depot, Bessemer also offers investments in leveraged buyouts, venture capital and real estate limited partnership funds. It also provides estate-  and tax-planning services.</p>
        <p>''Wealthy individuals want the services Bessemer has,'' said Mr. Branin, who will join the larger firm along with seven partners. Apart from managing the affairs of his former clients, Mr. Branin said, his position, and those of his old partners, in Bessemer have not been determined.</p>
        <p>For Bessemer, the transaction was ''an opportunity for us to add some very talented private-client services and investment professionals,'' said Donald J. Herrema, the chief executive of the larger firm.</p>
        <p>Business has been booming at Bessemer, and it needed more employees quickly. Its assets under management have more than tripled over the last five years.</p>
        <p>Bessemer was founded in 1907 as the family office of Henry Phipps, a partner of Andrew Carnegie in the Carnegie Steel Company. Its purpose was to invest the $50 million Mr. Phipps received in the sale of the steel business to J. P. Morgan. In 1974, the family decided to take on outside clients.</p>
        <p>Bessemer added Miami to its New York and Palm Beach offices in 1981 and now does business in eight cities. It opened an Atlanta office last year and expects to open one in Silicon Valley in the next few months.</p>
        <p>The minimum investment with Bessemer is $5 million. The average client's portfolio is worth $22 million, executives said, and there are several dozen with investments of more than $100 million. Brundage, Story's minimum was $1 million and the average portfolio was worth $5 million to $10 million.</p>
