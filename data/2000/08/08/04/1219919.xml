        <p>Salomon Smith Barney offered yesterday to buy $94.5 billion worth of the interest portion of Treasury securities, known as strips, from institutional and retail owners.</p>
        <p>Salomon said it wanted to combine the interest portions with bond principal to create whole bonds that would be eligible for sale back to the Treasury as part of the government's buyback program.</p>
        <p>This year, the Treasury is expected to buy back as much as $30 billion of Treasury bonds with  maturities of 10 years to 25 years remaining. The government is reducing borrowing amid growing budget surpluses.</p>
        <p>Wall Street firms often break up the interest and the principal portions of a bond and sell them separately as zero-coupon bonds.</p>
        <p>Salomon has an oversupply of the principal portions of existing bonds but a shortage of the interest-rate portion. And if the firm wants to take advantage of the premium prices the Treasury is paying to buy back existing bonds, it needs to reconstitute the two portions into whole bonds.</p>
        <p>''This offer will allow us to continue to be actively involved in the Treasury buyback program,'' said Charles Parkhurst, co-head of the United States government bond department at Salomon.</p>
        <p>The $94.5 billion is the face value of the interest portion of the bonds. But the bonds would be purchased at a discount to the price so that the total cost would be less than $94.5 billion. Salomon is offering investors cash for the interest portions of the bond, or would swap them for a principal portion.</p>
