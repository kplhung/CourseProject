        <p>''Raging Bull'' is not simply the greatest boxing movie ever made; Martin Scorsese's 1980 masterpiece is arguably the finest American film released in a decade when Hollywood retreated from the tragic realist vision of American life enshrined in Francis Ford Coppola's first two ''Godfather'' films.</p>
        <p>It may also have been the last movie to embody an ascendant cinematic vision that stretched neo-realist aesthetics to fit epic Hollywood ambitions. If ''Raging Bull'' is much closer in look and spirit to Rossellini than Mr. Coppola's films are, it is also an extremely self-conscious masterwork that forces us to feel the metaphorical weight of every bead of sweat, hallway shadow and camera angle.</p>

        <p>''Raging Bull'' is not simply the greatest boxing movie ever made; Martin Scorsese's 1980 masterpiece is arguably the finest American film released in a decade when Hollywood retreated from the tragic realist vision of American life enshrined in Francis Ford Coppola's first two ''Godfather'' films.</p>
        <p>It may also have been the last movie to embody an ascendant cinematic vision that stretched neo-realist aesthetics to fit epic Hollywood ambitions. If ''Raging Bull'' is much closer in look and spirit to Rossellini than Mr. Coppola's films are, it is also an extremely self-conscious masterwork that forces us to feel the metaphorical weight of every bead of sweat, hallway shadow and camera angle.</p>
        <p>On one level, the black-and-white film (augmented with a short, grainy color home movie sequence), which Film Forum is showing to celebrate the picture's 20th anniversary, is a grim, realistic biography of the boxing legend Jake La Motta. But the 1940's middleweight champion who is its real-life antihero is also emblematic of larger forces. He is the ultimate screen embodiment of raw Italian-American machismo at a certain moment in the ever-shifting melting pot of New York City. Blindly fighting his way to the top, then falling and stumbling into a shabby middle age, undone by the same forces by which he rose, he is a potent tribal symbol who ultimately embarrasses his tribe.</p>
        <p>The wonder of Mr. Scorsese's vision and of Robert De Niro's Academy Award-winning portrayal of Jake is that we feel any compassion for this flailing, instinctual beast who abuses his wife and, in a fit of paranoia, beats up his brother. Yet by the end of the movie, when Jake is a bloated, chest-puffing stand-up comic pathetically mouthing off in a dive for a few extra dollars, the character has achieved a certain embattled nobility. Encased in rolls of flesh (Mr. De Niro put on 50 pounds to play the older Jake) and flashing an ugly, porcine grin, he is still lunging and punching at life as aggressively (and as blindly) as ever.</p>
        <p>''Raging Bull,'' like no movie before, personalizes the ''Godfather'' films' Darwinian vision of an immigrant urban culture muscling its way up the lower rungs of the social ladder. But where Mr. Coppola celebrated a shadow aristocracy with its own grand, quasi-royal pecking order, rituals and traditions, Mr. Scorsese imagined a world unencumbered by majesty. Even the Copacabana, the legendary Manhattan nightclub, is remembered as a boisterous roughneck dive peopled with fight promoters and Mafiosi dolled up in their Saturday night best. Few movies have so indelibly captured the gritty squall of New York's mean streets in the 1940's and 50's, a world of streetwise men in sweat-stained undershirts in un-air-conditioned tenements.</p>
        <p>The boxing sequences, with their gorgeous images of sweat and blood flying from smashed heads and the thuds of body blows (made by squashing melons and tomatoes) echoing in a concentrated silence, are among the most visceral fight scenes ever filmed. They are matched in intensity by an unforgettable scene in which Jake, finally forced into a corner, turns on himself as he would on an opponent. Dragged into a prison cell after being convicted of selling alcohol to minors in his nightclub, he violently butts his head  against the wall and howls and screams in pain and frustration.</p>
        <p>''Raging Bull'' brought Joe Pesci to the screen in what remains his greatest role as Jake's devoted, protective brother, who nurtures the fighter until Jake turns on him. As Jake's teenage wife, Vickie, who stoically endures his pathologically jealous tirades and brutal manhandling until the lid blows off, Cathy Moriarty is the essence of sullen, smoldering sexuality. Think of Lana Turner in ''The Postman Always Rings Twice,'' stripped of genteel Hollywood airs and with a tough New York accent.</p>
        <p>''Raging Bull'' is showing in a glistening new 35-millimeter print. It should be seen in a theater. It's one American classic without a misstep.</p>
        <p>''Raging Bull'' is at the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village, through Thursday. Tickets: $9; $5 for members. Box office: (212) 727-8110.</p>
