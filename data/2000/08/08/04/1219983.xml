        <p>Winding up a weeklong vacation by the sea, Vice President Al Gore said today that he had narrowed his list of potential running mates to six plus one ''wild card.''</p>
        <p>The list, Democratic officials said, consists of Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, John Edwards of North Carolina and Evan Bayh of Indiana, as well as Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Winding up a weeklong vacation by the sea, Vice President Al Gore said today that he had narrowed his list of potential running mates to six plus one ''wild card.''</p>
        <p>The list, Democratic officials said, consists of Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, John Edwards of North Carolina and Evan Bayh of Indiana, as well as Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>''It's down to six, with one wild card that I haven't completely eliminated,'' Mr. Gore told reporters on the beach here, with his wife, Tipper.</p>
        <p>Some of the six are believed to be on the list for strategic purposes -- that is, to suggest that Mr. Gore is looking at a woman, for example, when in fact he is not. Both Governor Shaheen and Mr. Gephardt have said they are not interested in the job.</p>
        <p>Officials close to the campaign said that all six had spoken with Warren Christopher, who is heading Mr. Gore's search process, and had been vetted.</p>
        <p>The officials also said that clearly off the list at this point were former Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. All three are in their 60's, and the selection of any one would run counter to the campaign's assertion that it wants to present an energetic ticket that is oriented toward the future.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has been hashing over his possibilities and looking for political feedback from his family, Mr. Christopher, Bill Daley, his new campaign chairman, and Alexis M. Herman, the secretary of labor. It is not clear how much actual winnowing he has done while on vacation, since he said on the way here that his list had fewer than 10 people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley said in an interview that there would be no surprises and that ''nobody's sneaking under the radar.''</p>
        <p>Another Democratic official suggested that the purpose of mentioning a wild card was to allow Mr. Gore to ''keep his options open.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley said he expected Mr. Gore, who is to leave North Carolina on Friday morning for a campaign stop in Chicago before heading back to Washington, was close to making up his mind.</p>
        <p>''He's going to come back Friday,'' Mr. Daley said, ''and, in my opinion, if he's not 100 percent there, he'll be 80 percent there.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I know he hasn't'' made a decision. The announcement is scheduled for noon Tuesday in Nashville.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley also dismissed a plea by Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, to steer clear of naming a Democratic senator whose replacement would then be picked by a Republican governor.</p>
        <p>''It will not stop him from going with somebody who he thinks he's comfortable with and is the best candidate,'' Mr. Daley said of Mr. Daschle's entreaty. ''Be great if he could pick somebody from a Democratic state, but as you know, there aren't a hell of a lot of Democratic states out there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley shrugged off the daily boomlets of different names, attributing those to lobbying done on their behalf.</p>
        <p>''They're not based upon anything that's coming from Gore, O.K.?'' Mr. Daley said. ''Those of us who are involved in this sort of suck it in and analyze it and pass it on to him and say, 'Here are three people who called saying they really think the Bob Kerrey idea is a great idea, here's why, so if you're still open to people, figure this in.'</p>
        <p>''So it bounces within him, but this boomlet is not coming from him or coming from us.''</p>
        <p>One of those with an edge in the lobbying department is Senator Edwards. A number of his advisers in his 1998 Senate race, in which he ousted the incumbent Republican, Lauch Faircloth, are among Mr. Gore's top campaign officials.</p>
        <p>The Edwards supporters say that the senator, a 47-year-old trial lawyer, is the candidate who would most reinforce Mr. Gore's message against the Republican ''old guard.'' Mr. Edwards also happens to come from a state with a Democratic governor.</p>
        <p>The major drawback to selecting  Mr. Edwards is his relative inexperience. He has been in the Senate only two years, and his selection could undermine Mr. Gore's repeated assertion that the most important criterion in a running mate is that the person be ready to take over from day one.</p>
        <p>Still, Gore operatives are working on a way to sell Mr. Edwards instantly to voters as someone who is capable of becoming president. One suggestion is that immediately upon the announcement, several long-time Democratic senators make testimonials to Mr. Edwards's brilliance and how he represents a once-in-a-generation talent.</p>
