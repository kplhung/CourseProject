        <p>It was not raining when the Yankees and the Royals were supposed to start playing at 7:05 last night. But it started raining an hour later and kept pouring for two and a half more hours, turning Yankee Stadium into a quagmire, sending hundreds of unhappy fans home and forcing Roger Clemens to be another bystander who had to wait and hope for baseball.</p>
        <p>The Yankees did not start the game on time because they knew the rain was coming and that proved to be the proper decision. The Yankees did not postpone the game as the rain persisted because it was the last time Kansas City would visit the Bronx this year and that proved to be an interesting decision.

        <p>It was not raining when the Yankees and the Royals were supposed to start playing at 7:05 last night. But it started raining an hour later and kept pouring for two and a half more hours, turning Yankee Stadium into a quagmire, sending hundreds of unhappy fans home and forcing Roger Clemens to be another bystander who had to wait and hope for baseball.</p>
        <p>The Yankees did not start the game on time because they knew the rain was coming and that proved to be the proper decision. The Yankees did not postpone the game as the rain persisted because it was the last time Kansas City would visit the Bronx this year and that proved to be an interesting decision. Clemens did not throw the first pitch until 10:38 p.m.</p>
        <p>On a dry night, the game would have already ended by the time it started last night. But the Yankees did not really care that it was almost 2 a.m. when Paul O'Neill looped a single to left field off Jerry Spradlin in the bottom of the ninth inning to knock in Luis Polonia from second base and carry them to a 3-2 victory.</p>
        <p>Polonia, who was playing his first game with the Yankees after clearing waivers yesterday, opened the ninth with a walk, raced to second on a groundout by Derek Jeter and was mobbed at home by his new teammates after he scored.</p>
        <p>Glenallen Hill's towering pop-up into the rain glanced off second baseman Carlos Febles's glove in the eighth inning and enabled Scott Brosius to scamper home from first and even the score, 2-2.</p>
        <p>Spradlin walked Brosius with two out and obviously thought he was out of the inning when Hill hit a ball into shallow right field. Instead, the Yankees had some life and Clemens had a no-decision and not a loss.</p>
        <p>With the Yankees leading, 1-0, in the sixth, Mark Quinn singled to center and reached third on Jermaine Dye's single to right.</p>
        <p>Clemens induced Joe Randa to hit a chopping grounder, but it bounced past Clemens and past Jeter to score Quinn. David McCarty followed with a single to left that put Kansas City ahead, 2-1.</p>
        <p>Tino Martinez, who blasted a right-field upper-deck homer off Makoto Suzuki in the second, also had a one-out double in the sixth. But the Yankees could not deliver him in as Jose Vizcaino grounded out with runners on first and third. Suzuki stranded two more runners in the seventh and the Yankees were 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position against Suzuki.</p>
        <p>Clemens was 37 years old when he started this game and he was 38 when it ended. Today is his birthday. He pitched as if he were much younger for most of the night, giving up two runs and five hits in seven innings while striking out nine and walking one. After the no-decision, he is 5-0 with a 2.01 earned run average in his last seven starts since being activated.</p>
        <p>''I've seen a more aggressive pitcher who is not afraid to throw strikes and is not afraid to throw inside,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ''He seems calmer. I know that sounds like an oxymoron. But he's got that look in his eyes. There's a look of confidence.''</p>
        <p>Johnny Damon opened the game by smacking a grounder to shortstop, which Jeter fielded before floating a high throw to first. No problem. Clemens quickly retired the next three hitters. Randa singled to start the second and Jeter had McCarty's grounder glance off his arm. Again, no problem. Clemens zipped through three batters to save Jeter a second time.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Pittsburgh Pirates designated LUIS SOJO for assignment yesterday, but General Manager BRIAN CASHMAN said he was unsure if the Yankees would pursue the utility infielder. Sojo played with the Yankees from 1996 to 1999, but they did not re-sign him and figured they could save money by using the rookie D'ANGELO JIMENEZ in that role. Jimenez fractured his neck in a car accident, and the Yankees used CLAY BELLINGER and WILSON DELGADO, who was designated for assignment to open a roster spot for LUIS POLONIA, as reserve infielders. Sojo is a better defensive infielder and is more experienced than Bellinger, but Bellinger can play the outfield and is a better base runner.</p>
