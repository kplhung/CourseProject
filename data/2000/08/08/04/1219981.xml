        <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has struck down New York State's century-old kosher food laws, saying that their requirement that such food be prepared according to Orthodox Jewish law violated the Constitution's First Amendment prohibition on religious involvement by the state.</p>
        <p>''The entanglements involved here between religion and the state are not only excessive in themselves, but they have the unconstitutional effect of endorsing and advancing religion,'' Judge Nina Gershon declared in a 27-page ruling issued last week and reported yesterday in The New York Jewish Week.</p>

        <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has struck down New York State's century-old kosher food laws, saying that their requirement that such food be prepared according to Orthodox Jewish law violated the Constitution's First Amendment prohibition on religious involvement by the state.</p>
        <p>''The entanglements involved here between religion and the state are not only excessive in themselves, but they have the unconstitutional effect of endorsing and advancing religion,'' Judge Nina Gershon declared in a 27-page ruling issued last week and reported yesterday in The New York Jewish Week.</p>
        <p>Under the kosher food laws, state market inspectors for decades have visited kosher retailers across the state to see that meat, poultry, seafood and dairy products marked ''kosher'' have been processed in accordance with what the statutes call ''Orthodox Hebrew religious requirements.'' Violators are subject to criminal penalties.</p>
        <p>Conservative and Reform Jewish groups generally hailed the court's decision, saying that it pointed up the need for a new consensus on the definition of kosher. State officials and lawyers for several national Orthodox Jewish groups who had defended the statutes in the case said that appeals were very likely, and that the laws might ultimately be rewritten to meet the judicial objections.</p>
        <p>While the New York laws, written in the late 19th century, define kosher as Orthodox, many Jews -- Orthodox, Conservative and Reform -- do not agree on what constitutes kosher, and many contend that the state laws are unevenly enforced. Nevertheless, proponents say the laws are needed to protect consumers from unscrupulous retailers or other food processors who might try to cut corners in preparing and distributing products that are often sold at a premium under a kosher label.</p>
        <p>Saying that the statutes ''require the state to affirmatively assume ongoing obligations of enforcement of purely religious laws, inevitably requiring the state to rely on religious authority and interpretation to properly enforce them,'' the judge also issued an injunction barring the state's Department of Agriculture and Markets from enforcing the laws in hundreds of retail outlets in the state where kosher foods are sold.</p>
        <p>The decision was the latest of several losses for kosher food laws, including a New Jersey statute overturned in 1992 and a Baltimore ordinance struck down in 1995. It came in a lawsuit filed in 1996 by two Commack, N.Y., butchers, who contended that the state laws were promoting Orthodox Judaism and depriving non-Orthodox consumers of constitutional rights to equal protection of the law.</p>
        <p>Robert J. Dinerstein, the lawyer who represented the plaintiffs, Brian and Jeffrey Yarmeisch, the owners of Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats, hailed the ruling, but offered an olive branch to Orthodox groups and state legislators who have supported the kosher laws.</p>
        <p>''We regret that the intransigence of some people forced us to seek such a drastic solution to a problem which should have been resolved among the various denominations of Judaism,'' Mr. Dinerstein said. ''We hope that a new law is enacted to protect the kosher consumer, which will be sensitive to the fact that there is no unanimity as to what constitutes kosher.''</p>
        <p>Jessica Chittenden, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Agriculture and Markets, would not comment on the ruling and said she was unable to provide information yesterday on the standards and methods that the Division of Kosher Law Enforcement uses to implement the laws. Rabbi Luzer Weiss, the director of the division, which employs the state's kosher inspection force, was reportedly not taking calls on the matter.</p>
        <p>Darren Dopp, a spokesman for Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, whose office defended the state, said that an appeal was very likely, although no decision had been made. ''We are committed to protecting kosher consumers,'' he said. ''Without these laws, there is no guarantee that products are kosher.''</p>
        <p>Nathan Lewin, a Washington lawyer who represented a group of mostly Orthodox national organizations and individuals who intervened in the case on behalf of the state, also said an appeal was very likely. ''The word kosher is a symbol for something that has a common accepted meaning, and has for hundreds of years,'' he said. ''We're just trying to protect the consumer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewin said the state kosher laws, which may date back 118 years, were challenged in a 1925 lawsuit, Hygrade Provision v. Sherman, on the ground that the term ''kosher'' was too vague. The case went to the United States Supreme Court, which concluded, he said, that ''the term kosher has a meaning well-enough defined to enable one engaged in the trade to correctly apply it.''</p>
        <p>The state is not imposing the use of the word kosher, Mr. Lewin said, and he insisted that for all the contentiousness over definitions, nearly all Jews -- 99.9 percent, as he put it -- generally agreed on whether food was kosher. ''It's never been a problem,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat and an Orthodox Jew who supported the state's case, called the judge's decision wrong. ''Accommodation of religion is not establishment of religion,'' he said. ''I also think the state has a definite interest in making sure that if something is advertised as kosher, it is kosher, just as if eggs are advertised as Grade A they are not Grade B.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Jerome Epstein, executive vice president of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, which represents nearly 800 Conservative congregations in the United States and Canada, said he thought the judge had ruled properly. ''Ideally, it would be great if we could come to a massive consensus as to what kosher is,'' he said. But lacking that, he added, ''the state should not be involved.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Epstein, who had no role in the case, said there were different criteria of kosher even within Orthodox Judaism, which he said helped explain why, within that branch, there were ''so many different rabbis who certify what is kosher.''</p>
        <p>In general, kosher meats and other foods must be prepared in accordance with kashrut, the dietary laws set out in the Old Testament and reinterpreted over the centuries by various rabbis, including Rabbi Joseph Caro, who codified Jewish law in 16th-century Safed.</p>
        <p>Under such interpretations, beef is said to be made kosher after slaughter by draining the blood in a process of salting and soaking. While inspectors do not usually visit slaughterhouses, tags are applied to guarantee that kosher meat has been salted and soaked, and inspectors at retail outlets look for the tags. In addition, they see to it that meat and dairy products are not mixed. Under the laws, violators are subject to misdemeanor or felony penalties, depending on the seriousness of the case.</p>
