        <p>Editorial on new eponymous restaurant opened by acclaimed chef Alain Ducasse in Essex Hotel on Central Park South in Manhattan notes guilty pleasures of the truly expensive and luxurious</p>

        <p>What was the name of the best restaurant in ancient Epicurean Rome? How were the prices? And the waiters, did they understand the meaning of service or did they thumb the plates unmercifully on the way to the table? Somehow these questions arise at the thought of the new, eponymous restaurant run by the acclaimed chef Alain Ducasse in the Essex Hotel on Central Park South in Manhattan, a place that also brings to mind J. Pierpont Morgan's advice about the cost of keeping a yacht. The prix fixe dinner at Alain Ducasse is $160, with a la carte appetizers in the $50 range and entrees that reach $74. At these prices, it's tempting to say that it's only a meal, after all. But it's also tempting to say that it's only money.</p>
        <p>At Alain Ducasse the food obviously matters, but what matters just as much is the service. Alain Ducasse seats only 65 diners a night. It has 55 waiters. Most of us learned to tip in restaurants where one sore-footed waiter served several tables. But 55 waiters must spend most of their time trying to stay out of each other's way, and it's hard to know how to tip for that. It sounds as though a meal at Alain Ducasse is like being fitted for an expensive suit, which is a test not only of composure but also of the depths of one's self-importance.</p>

        <p>New York is full of places that make you feel like your prim maiden aunt from Cedar Rapids. That's what makes it New York. Secretly, we all feel that way from time to time, suddenly aware of the strangeness to which we've become accustomed, momentarily shocked at the prices we take for granted, the customs we glibly embrace. Alain Ducasse may be a restaurant for the imaginary identities that lurk within a lucky few of us -- the well-heeled gourmet who enjoys having a harem of waiters, the oenophile who can actually taste the restaurant's surcharge. But it may also be for the prim maiden aunt within us. There is no thrill like the thrill a puritan gets in the thick of sin.</p>
