        <p>A mother backing up her car in a town house complex here struck her 16-month-old baby Wednesday in an accident that seemed to turn on a bizarre confluence of missteps, the police said today.</p>
        <p>The baby, Danielle Kunak, suffered injuries to her liver and lung but was listed in stable condition today at Yale-New Haven Hospital. A neighbor in this Putnam County town said doctors told the baby's parents, Lynn and Jeffrey Kunak, that they expected a full recovery.</p>
        <p>At about 3 p.m. Wednesday, Ms. Kunak placed Danielle on the front passenger seat of her Ford Escort station wagon -- without strapping her into a car seat or fastening the seat belt. Ms. Kunak was about to move the car from the parking space in front of her town house to her garage, a distance of about 40 feet, said Sgt. David R. Claytor of the New York State Police in Brewster.</p>
        <p>But as Ms. Kunak waited, with the gear shift in reverse and her foot on the brake, for pedestrians to pass behind her, a 5-year-old girl who lives in the next town house suddenly opened the passenger door. Sergeant  Claytor said it was not clear whether the girl wanted to see the baby or was about to warn the mother of the approach of boys on scooters.</p>
        <p>When the door opened, Danielle tumbled out of the car. As Ms. Kunak lunged toward the baby in an unsuccessful attempt to grab her, her foot came off the brake pedal, causing the car to roll backward. The wheels were turned at an angle, and the right front tire struck the baby, Sergeant Claytor said, but did not roll over her.</p>
        <p>''I heard the scream,'' said Debra West, a friend and neighbor of Ms. Kunak's and a freelance reporter for The New York Times. ''It was horrible. The baby was as white as a ghost, but she was conscious.''</p>
        <p>The baby was taken to Danbury Hospital in Danbury, Conn., then transferred to Yale-New Haven.</p>
        <p>In New York State, children under the age of 4 being transported in a vehicle must be restrained in specially designed seats that meet federal safety guidelines. All 50 states and the District of Columbia now have child restraint laws.</p>
        <p>But the state police said they did not plan to charge Ms. Kunak. ''Technically, we could cite her, but it was a freakish thing,'' Sergeant Claytor said. ''It was several bad things happening at once.''</p>
