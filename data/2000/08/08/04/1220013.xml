        <p>Helped by improved efficiency at its mines and a decline in the value of the South African rand, Gold Fields Ltd., the world's third-largest producer of gold, reported that quarterly profits more than tripled to 370 million rand, or $53 million. The performance was considered especially strong in light of the languishing price of gold. Gold Fields has agreed to merge with the Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation of Canada and move its primary stock listing from Johannesburg to Toronto, but the merger has yet to be approved by South Africa.</p>
