        <p>Adam Vinatieri's 28-yard field goal with two seconds remaining lifted visiting New England to a 13-10 victory over Detroit last night in a preseason game.</p>
        <p>The rookie quarterback Tom Brady set up the winning kick with an 47-yard pass to Sean Morey, who carried it to the Lions' 10. Brady completed 10 of 15 attempts for 129 yards.</p>
        <p>Vinatieri, who also had a 50-yarder, capped the 4-play, 59-yard drive on the next play for the Patriots.</p>
        <p>Defensive tackle Willie McGinest returned an interception 49 yards for a touchdown for New England, which beat San Francisco, 21-0, on Monday night.</p>
        <p>Sedrick Irvin scored on a 2-yard run and Jason Hanson kicked a 33-yard field goal for Detroit.</p>
        <p>BILLS BLOCK BENGALS' LAST CHANCE: The rookie linebacker Corey Moore blocked Doug Pelfrey's 29-yard field-goal attempt as time ran out, and host Buffalo held on for a 21-20 preseason victory over Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>Shawn Bryson's 73-yard reception off a screen pass 1 minute 13 seconds into the fourth quarter stood up as the game-winner in the preseason opener for both teams.</p>
        <p>Receiver Avion Black had a 34-yard touchdown reception, and running back Antowain Smith a 16-yard scoring run for the Bills.</p>
        <p>The second-year running back Nick Williams scored both Cincinnati touchdowns -- both on 1-yard plunges -- as the Bengals lost their sixth straight preseason game, dating from Aug. 22, 1998. Cincinnati also got two field goals -- a 26-yarder in the first quarter by Pelfrey, and a 20-yarder by the rookie Neil Rackers late in the third.</p>
        <p>JAGUARS' BACKUPS ROLL PAST PANTHERS: Jacksonville's backups combined for three scores, including two touchdowns from the seldom-used running back Stacey Mack, in a 34-14 victory over host Carolina in a preseason opener. Mack, who carried the ball just seven times during his rookie season, scored on a 5-yard touchdown run and returned the second-half kickoff 94 yards for another score.</p>
        <p>Jacksonville also got a touchdown from the third-team running back Chris Howard and field goals of 42 and 22 yards from Mike Hollis.</p>
        <p>Mark Brunell started Jacksonville's scoring with a 39-yard pass to Jimmy Smith on the only series the first-team offense played. Brunell finished 3 for 3 for 64 yards.</p>
        <p>Carolina did not play Reggie White, Eric Swann and Chuck Smith, its three big off-season acquisitions.</p>
        <p>TAMPA BAY OFFENSE DOES THE JOB: Shaun King was nearly perfect in throwing the ball, and the rookie Joe Hamilton tossed a 12-yard touchdown pass to Todd Yoder with 1:43 remaining to give the host Buccaneers a 13-12 preseason victory over Washington.</p>
        <p>King completed 10 of 11 passes for 104 yards in what was a modest debut for the offense the Bucs are installing after failing to score a touchdown in last season's National Football Conference championship game.</p>
        <p>Keyshawn Johnson had 3 receptions for 33 yards in his first action for the Bucs, who acquired the two-time Pro Bowl receiver from the Jets for a pair of first-round draft picks this spring.</p>
        <p>The rookies LaVar Arrington and Chris Samuels, the second and third picks in the draft, made their debuts for Washington. Deion Sanders made a brief appearance, too, as part of the defense the Redskins revamped.</p>
        <p>N.F.L. TO TEST NOISE EXTERMINATORS: As part of an N.F.L. experiment, five players each from the New Orleans Saints and the Minnesota Vikings will wear high-tech hearing aids called noise exterminators during their exhibition game at the Metrodome tonight. N.F.L. officials say the tiny device, worn like a hearing aid, will help players hear quarterback snap counts over the fan noise. The aids have been in use for two years but are just now being tried in sports. They cost from $1,000 to $1,500 each.</p>
        <p>MOBLEY MAY MISS OPENER: Linebacker John Mobley could miss the Denver Broncos' regular-season opener after doctors found a bone chip in his right knee during surgery for torn cartilage yesterday. Mobley, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee in Denver's second game last season, is not expected to begin practicing for at least three weeks.</p>
        <p>FIEDLER FEELING BETTER: Miami Dolphins quarterback Jay Fiedler's hip surgery was successful and he might be able to play in the team's final exhibition game. Fiedler had the surgery late Thursday for an injury that has bothered him since the start of training camp. He had been battling Damon Huard for the team's starting quarterback spot. While the Dolphins hope he can return for the final exhibition on Aug. 25, he may be sidelined until early in the regular season.</p>
