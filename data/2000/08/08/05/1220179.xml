        <p>A 78-year-old Staten Island man has the unlucky distinction of having the nation's first known case of West Nile encephalitis this year, health officials said today. Meanwhile, birds found dead from the disease from the Atlantic almost to Lake Erie led the state health commissioner to declare the first statewide outbreak of the virus.</p>
        <p>The Staten Island patient, whose name was not made public, is at home after a weeklong hospital stay for treatment, said Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city health commissioner. Dr. Cohen said the man first complained of symptoms on July 20. This timing means that, taking into account the 5- to 15-day incubation period, he was infected before New York City began spraying pesticides to kill the mosquitoes that carry the virus.</p>
        <p>''This is the first evidence that we've had this year of a human case, either in New York City or anywhere else,'' said Dr. Steven M. Ostroff, the West Nile coordinator for the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who joined Dr. Cohen at a news conference.</p>
        <p>A few hours earlier, the state health commissioner, Dr. Antonia C. Novello, announced that in the last two days, tests had confirmed the presence of the virus in dead birds found in nine upstate counties where it had never been seen before, a region stretching from the Hudson Valley to the Adirondack Mountains to a suburb of Buffalo.</p>
        <p>Infected birds had already been found in New York City and all of the downstate suburban counties, and one was discovered in central New York State. Dr. Novello said the findings made it safe to assume that virtually every part of the state was affected, even where no infected birds had been found.</p>
        <p>This year's outbreak far exceeds the reach of last year's. The virus has been found as far north and east as Boston, in northern New Jersey and in Connecticut. Last year, the outbreak was limited to New York City and its nearest suburbs.</p>
        <p>So far this year, 123 infected birds have been found in New York State, almost matching last year's total of 130, with nearly three months left in the mosquito season.</p>
        <p>News of the virus's spread has surfaced at the height of the outdoor season, when people camp in the woods, tramp through marshes and spend balmy evenings in their rain-dampened yards, exposing themselves to mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>''We believe that New Yorkers, whatever county, and whether there are positive birds or not, must be taking common-sense protections,'' Dr. Novello said, ''such as wearing long-sleeve shirts, socks, shoes and, if necessary, try to apply an insect repellent that contains DEET,'' a chemical.</p>
        <p>Last year, when the disease appeared for the first time in the Western Hemisphere, 62 people in the metropolitan area were confirmed to have been sickened by the virus, and 7 of them died. Hundreds of Queens residents tested positive for the virus, but had no symptoms.</p>
        <p>Because the virus survived over the winter -- in mosquito populations in storm drains, perhaps, or damp basements -- and has gone much farther afield this summer, health officials fear that it may have become a longterm, even permanent, part of the American landscape of disease.</p>
        <p>Health officials stressed that they were calling for vigilance, not alarm, noting that only a tiny minority of the people infected become ill enough to require medical care, and most of those who are treated recover. People who are infected may never know it because they show no noticeable ill effects, or only mild symptoms that can be mistaken for a flu. The greatest risk is to the elderly, to very young children and to people whose immune systems are already suppressed, who can develop high fevers and encephalitis, a potentially fatal brain inflammation.</p>
        <p>Dr. Novello pleaded with New Yorkers to take precautions against the disease, to wear protective clothing when going outside and in particular to drain the stagnant water where mosquitoes breed.</p>
        <p>''Dispose of any tin can, plastic container, ceramic pots or anything similar that holds water on the outside of your house,'' she said at a news conference here. ''Remove old discarded tires on your property. This is the place most liked by mosquitoes for breeding. Clean any clogged rain gutters and any wading pool that is not in use, and turn every wheelbarrow that is in your neighborhood. Change the water in birdbaths at least twice a week.''</p>
        <p>She said the state would broadcast advertisements carrying that message on television and radio, and have them shown in movie theaters.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki's office said today that the governor would apply to the Clinton administration for disaster relief, to obtain federal aid to cover the cost of the state's intensive West Nile monitoring program. A similar request by Mr. Pataki for last year's expenses was denied in January, and state officials complained today that of almost $8 million in federal aid to states for combating the West Nile outbreak, New York State, where most of the cases have been, has received just $355,000. It was not clear today why more money went to other states.</p>
        <p>Dr. Novello said the state spent $14 million on dealing with the virus last year, and is likely to exceed that amount this year.</p>
        <p>The virus turned up recently in dead birds near Syracuse. In the last two days, tests confirmed infections in dead birds in Erie County; in Washington and Warren Counties in the southern Adirondacks; in Schenectady County, northeast of Albany; and in Albany, Rensselaer, Columbia, Putnam and Dutchess Counties in the Hudson Valley.</p>
        <p>Mosquitoes carry the virus and infect animals with it. Birds, especially crows, are particularly susceptible to West Nile, so sudden die-offs of birds are an important harbinger of the disease. Birds also appear to play the leading role in transporting the virus and the mosquitoes from one region to another.</p>
        <p>The state has left it up to counties to decide whether to spray pesticides, a decision that has proved highly contentious in and around New York City. Last month, the outbreak struck at the symbolic heart of the city, with the discovery of infected mosquitoes in Central Park, and the city closed the park overnight in order to spray there. Spraying is scheduled in the park again early Saturday morning, as well as in northern Manhattan and in parts of the Bronx and Queens.</p>
        <p>While Dr. Novello stressed that it was a local decision, she made her support for spraying plain, saying that the state would grant permission for it to any county that requests it. ''Good prevention and good common sense is better than looking back and saying, 'I should have sprayed,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Novello also noted that people should take precautions throughout the day, not just after dark. Last year, the virus was found in just one species of mosquito, Culex pipiens, which bites mostly at dusk and during the night. This year, she said, it has also been detected in another species, Aedes japonicus, which bites during the day.</p>
        <p>The virus appears to have entered the United States last summer through New York City, possibly in a mosquito aboard a ship or airplane, and spread from there.</p>
        <p>It moved farther afield this year for two reasons, officials say. First, last year's outbreak began in August, with the mosquito-breeding season half over, while this year it will have the entire span from May to October to spread. Second, this year's heavy rains in the Northeast have promoted more mosquito breeding than usual, although they may have flushed out standing water and had the opposite effect in some places.</p>
