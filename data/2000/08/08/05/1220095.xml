        <p>In a vast and utilitarian exhibition center, 7,000 people have assembled in what is probably one of the most ethnically diverse, but purposefully homogenous, encampments on earth.</p>
        <p>Temporarily living inside the Jaarbeurs Exposition Center, a warehouse-like space within sight of the Utrecht train station, are people from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, Latin America, the South Pacific and the United States.

        <p>In a vast and utilitarian exhibition center, 7,000 people have assembled in what is probably one of the most ethnically diverse, but purposefully homogenous, encampments on earth.</p>
        <p>Temporarily living inside the Jaarbeurs Exposition Center, a warehouse-like space within sight of the Utrecht train station, are people from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, Latin America, the South Pacific and the United States. Two hundred nations and territories are represented, and dozens of languages are spoken. But everyone here is a Christian evangelist.</p>
        <p>They sleep in bunk beds, dine at long tables and form groups each morning at 7 to board chartered trains for the half-hour ride and a conference arranged by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, which -- at the cost of millions of dollars -- is paying for their transportation and housing here. The nine-day event, also attended by 3,000 others flush enough to stay in hotels, concludes on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The organizational scope is close to breathtaking.</p>
        <p>''We're building a city inside a building,'' said John Drake, the Graham association's man in charge here, who works the rest of the year as an official with the Y.M.C.A. in England. ''For some people who come here, we've built a city bigger than their hometown -- and that includes some of the Americans.''</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Drake is a crew of 700 volunteers, themselves an international group, who wear bright blue vests identifying them as ''stewards'' at the event, called Amsterdam 2000, and sometimes cruise the vast expanse of Jaarbeurs on roller skates.</p>
        <p>The Graham organization has divided the evangelists in residence into five groups, with each assigned a color -- blue, green, gray, purple or red. The color determines their dining table and train for Amsterdam and the colored carpet that leads to their double-deck bunk beds -- carefully identified by number -- at night. The sleeping quarters for the overwhelmingly male population of this temporary global village are strictly segregated by sex.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the measure of the quiet logistical efficiency here is that the worst problem for the director of security -- Ted E. Cornell, a graduate of the Julliard School of Music who directs choirs at events led by Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's eldest son -- was some cash that was misplaced until ''the guy found it.''</p>
        <p>With security apparently assured and at least 7 doctors and 40 nurses on hand to deal with any medical problems, delegates have been able to concentrate on one of the purposes of the gathering: meeting other evangelists from around the world.</p>
        <p>Of course, some of the mingling unites compatriots long separated by distance. Louis Girardin, 33, an evangelist from the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, sat across the breakfast table one morning from Gregory Toussaint, 26, a Haitian-born resident of New York City and a student, who was exulting in finding 50 or so Haitians here.</p>
        <p>''It's a wonderful place,'' Mr. Girardin said. ''We are one spirit, the spirit of the Lord.''</p>
        <p>For others, the sheer internationalism of this gathering impels them to reach out to any new face and nationality, albeit with smiles and gestures if a language barrier precludes more intense conversation.</p>
        <p>''When I meet people, I talk,'' said Taher Abu S. Chowdury, 43, who came here from Chittagong in his native Bangladesh, and marveled at being surrounded by hundreds of Europeans, Africans and Americans. ''When I think someone is smiling at me, I try to talk with them.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Edward J. Enim, 44, director of an organization called Coast for Christ Baptist Ministries in Ghana, said that in his sleeping area alone, he had met people from Madagascar, India and the United States. ''We've been exchanging ideas, we've been exchanging strategies for ministries,'' he said, conceding that, at first, the Jaarbeurs center did not strike him as particularly impressive. ''But when you're inside, it's like a city. It's unbelievable!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Enim was among the few visitors to remark on the Dutch hosts of the meeting, whom he praised for their efficiency and friendliness, but admonished for spiritual laxity. Visiting Amsterdam, he said, ''has given me more of a burden to pray for Holland,'' adding, ''People have so much, they don't know what they need.''</p>
        <p>Back in history, he said, ''the Netherlands were a launching pad for missions.'' But, Mr. Enim said, the country appears since to have strayed from its historic faith. ''They need to come back,'' he said. ''But they are lovely people.''</p>
        <p>Some Americans spoke of quite specific cross-cultural experiences. ''There are no walls to encase the noise,'' said William B. Petree, 28, a student at Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary in San Francisco. ''You know, a lot of people sing themselves to sleep.''</p>
        <p>Are they singing hymns? ''It's not in English, so you don't know,'' he said. ''But this morning, one person was singing, 'His eye is on the sparrow, so I know he watches me,' and people chimed in.''</p>
        <p>Stanley R. Kolbert, 43, another student at Golden Gate, noted that the sense of religious purpose transcended any differences here.</p>
        <p>''We may not speak the same languages,'' he said, ''but we have Jesus in our hearts.''</p>
