        <p>Finding the apartment was the easy part. The problems started when the fellows moved in.</p>
        <p>After two weeks of searching, Tom Kim signed a lease for a place in a prewar building on East 53rd Street and First Avenue with a garden courtyard.  Apartment 4E had two bedrooms, hardwood floors, high ceilings, a fresh paint job, lots of windows and unencumbered rays of sunlight. With the exception of the four flights of stairs Mr. Kim would have to climb each day, it was everything he thought he and his future roommates would want, and, at $2,100 a month split three ways, dirt cheap.</p>

        <p>Finding the apartment was the easy part. The problems started when the fellows moved in.</p>
        <p>After two weeks of searching, Tom Kim signed a lease for a place in a prewar building on East 53rd Street and First Avenue with a garden courtyard.  Apartment 4E had two bedrooms, hardwood floors, high ceilings, a fresh paint job, lots of windows and unencumbered rays of sunlight. With the exception of the four flights of stairs Mr. Kim would have to climb each day, it was everything he thought he and his future roommates would want, and, at $2,100 a month split three ways, dirt cheap.</p>
        <p>The apartment was a crucial part of a plan to recreate the atmosphere of the dormitory he had shared with Charles Divak and Daniel Powell at Dartmouth College. Mr. Kim thought he and his friends, all recent college graduates, were well on the way to realizing their dream of living and working in Manhattan. But they were in for a surprise.</p>
        <p>Their fantasy apartment had no telephone jack. Water dripped from the ceiling when it rained. And their fan, once perched on the windowsill, nearly plunged to its death because there were no window screens.</p>
        <p>Welcome to New York City. Despite the congestion and the fabled difficulties in securing affordable housing, the moving vans just keep coming -- especially in the summer. Although specific numbers are elusive, those in the moving business say this is the peak season for college graduates and families -- with children out of school -- to pack their bags and head here. But if finding a home can be difficult, just wait until they try to move. This is a city that keeps its welcome mats tightly furled.</p>
        <p>''I just wanted to be surrounded by people who feel passionate about what they do,'' said Mr. Kim, who moved to avoid a two-hour commute from his parents' house on Long Island. ''I figured we would just suck it up and go here. We planned to be really cheap about it.''</p>
        <p>Within a week, Mr. Powell and Mr. Kim claimed the apartment's two bedrooms. Mr. Divak got a space for his air mattress on the floor of the common area. The three friends were happily crammed into the small apartment. Now they had to find jobs. But their apartment was not cooperating.</p>
        <p>''We didn't see the phone jack, and I said 'O.K., we're just not seeing it,' '' said Mr. Kim, 22, who smiled sheepishly when he recalled the frantic search for an outgoing line.</p>
        <p>He learned that his landlord had removed the phone jacks when the apartment was renovated and had failed to replace them. So the roommates had to wait seven days for the phone company to install a phone jack -- an eternity, since they were already well into their job searches. Two pay phones on the corner of 53rd Street and First Avenue became their office.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of rough to do phone interviews,'' Mr. Divak said. ''I was talking to a company and the operator cut in and said if I didn't deposit five cents they were going to cut me off. I couldn't find the money anywhere.''</p>
        <p>The men soon learned to cope. They balanced their note pads and telephone books on the ledge of the telephone booth and valiantly faced the angry stares of people waiting in line to use the phone. And Mr. Kim, who still carries extra quarters, mastered the art of ducking into the booth as far as he could and plugging one ear so that he could hear.</p>
        <p>Kathy Braddock, a partner in Intrepid New Yorker, a corporate relocation service, said that the city is difficult for newcomers to navigate. For example, she said, some people do not realize that many neighborhoods differ greatly from day to night. ''That's why a lot of relocations in this area fail,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Other newcomers underestimate the city's size. Jennifer Boggs, 24, and her fiance, Michael Wagner, moved to Staten Island from New Orleans last November. They chose Staten Island because Mr. Wagner was working there and the apartments would be larger and less expensive than those in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>With amenities like a backyard, garage and driveway, the couple thought Meirers Corners near Castleton Corners would be perfect. The best part of the deal was that their home was close to an express bus stop, which Ms. Boggs thought would provide her a quick commute to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Before she moved, she took the bus to a job interview near the World Trade Center. She arrived within 20 minutes. The job she accepted, however, was on 37th Street, and Ms. Boggs thought the difference in commuting time would be minimal.</p>
        <p>''Every day it would take so long,'' she said of the one-way trip that ended up taking two hours. ''I'd have to get up really early, and I never knew if I would get to work on time. It was such a miserable commute.''</p>
        <p>After six months of standing on the bus, she had had enough. The couple moved again on Staten Island to St. George, where Ms. Boggs, who works for Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., could walk to the Staten Island Ferry and get to work in one hour.</p>
        <p>''I like it a lot more,'' she said. ''We're more interested in Manhattan and being part of the city.''</p>
        <p>Many people who move to New York are drawn by the city's culture, museums, shopping and incessant activity. Holly Hargrave, 32, liked the trappings of Manhattan, but she did not want to make it her home.</p>
        <p>''It was just hot, and it didn't smell very good,'' she said. ''It was expensive, and it was crowded.''</p>
        <p>So when her husband, Brian, got a job on Wall Street, they moved to Brooklyn Heights from Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>When the Hargraves moved into their $3,500-a-month two-level brownstone apartment in June, they thought it would be clean and safe -- so safe that Ms. Hargrave asked her husband to take the bars off the windows. She thought they made the place look like Fort Knox. Her attitude soon changed.</p>
        <p>The Hargraves spent the second day in their new building unpacking and cleaning a mess that had been left by the previous tenants. While in the basement, they opened the outside door to circulate fresh air.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hargrave heard a noise in the next room and walked a few steps to investigate. He saw a man running up the stairs with his wife's bike. He chased him, but the thief jumped onto the bicycle and sped away. It was enough to make Ms. Hargrave want to jump in the car and go back to Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>''You get to a place and you're paying a fortune and it's filthy and you're trying to clean and unpack, and someone steals from you while you're home,'' Ms. Hargrave said. ''It's just a little much.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Hargrave believes the experience made her more savvy.</p>
        <p>''I should be glad,'' she said, ''that I learned that lesson because I probably wouldn't be cautious.''</p>
        <p>Although the Hargraves' nasty welcome came as they were unpacking, some people have trouble even before the boxes are out of the moving van. Ronna Brown, president of the New York City Metropolitan Better Business Bureau, said that the average American moved 11 times in a lifetime. ''It is worth the time and effort to do a little research before you decide which stranger you're going to let take your goods,'' she said.</p>
        <p>According to Ms. Brown, the bureau handled 517 complaints and 20,000 inquiries last year about moving companies. She suggests that those who move research and carefully plan the transfer.</p>
        <p>Well-prepared movers, she says, will obtain estimates from three moving companies that have inspected their goods, research the driving records of moving companies and read contracts thoroughly before signing them. She also advises that people insure furniture and check it once it is delivered.</p>
        <p>For Michael and Harriet Botwinick, those tips have long been the rules of the road. After moving 11 times, the couple seem to have the task down pat.</p>
        <p>When they moved to Brooklyn from California last year, the driver of their moving truck was from San Antonio and did not know the city's alternate-side-of-the-street parking rules or how narrow the streets could be in some neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>The truck started coming up a one-way street in Brooklyn Heights at 7:30 a.m. but got stuck when trying to make a turn. So the driver started backing up, one inch at a time. ''It took five hours to back the truck out of the street,'' Mr. Botwinick said.</p>
        <p>Although the truck created a small traffic jam, Mr. Botwinick said, the driver was meticulous and managed to squeeze through the street without damaging any cars.</p>
        <p>The horrific ordeal finally ended at 2 a.m., after the moving company brought in a van and started transferring the Botwinicks' belongings from the truck. The van easily slithered up the street several times to deliver the boxes to their new home.</p>
        <p>This year the Botwinicks are moving again, to Murray Hill. And their new movers were doing a praiseworthy job, they said.</p>
        <p>''A year ago on this day, I was beside myself,'' said Ms. Botwinick, who sat calmly in a rocking chair as movers strained and lifted boxes around her last month. ''The best thing to do with moving, if they seem to have it under control, is to let it be. Let them worry about it.''</p>
