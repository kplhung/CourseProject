        <p>Ever since More Than Ready took his first step onto a racetrack, friends and relatives of the horse's owner, James Scatuorchio, have been asking: ''When can we see him run here in New Jersey?''</p>
        <p>Scatuorchio, a retired Wall Street executive who describes his home as being 15 minutes from the eighth pole at Monmouth Park, traveled last season to Churchill Downs, Belmont Park and Saratoga to watch More Than Ready put together a five-race winning streak as a 2-year-old.</p>
        <p>This year, the dark bay colt's 3-year-old campaign began at Gulfstream Park, where he finished in a dead heat for first in the Hutcheson. He also raced at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans, Keeneland and then back in Louisville, Ky., where he finished fourth in the Kentucky Derby behind Fusaichi Pegasus.</p>
        <p>More Than Ready took a two-month break before finishing second in the Dwyer Stakes at Belmont last month. Now Scatuorchio finally has an answer for his friends in New Jersey: More Than Ready is the 5-2  favorite over eight 3-year-olds, including the Belmont Stakes winner, Commendable, in the $1 million Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''We considered running him here last year, but it didn't work out,'' Scatuorchio said. ''A lot of people wanted to see him run, so it's really a thrill that he's running in this. Outside of the Derby, the Haskell is the race I want to win.''</p>
        <p>Although favorites have won the last half-dozen editions of the Haskell, Sunday's mile-and-an-eighth race is not an easy spot for More Than Ready, who has yet to win beyond seven furlongs. Along with Commendable, the Haskell drew two other Triple Crown veterans: Captain Steve, who rebounded from his eighth-place finish in the Derby and fourth-place finish in the Preakness to win the Iowa Derby and the Swaps in California two weeks ago, and Impeachment, who finished fifth in the Belmont after running third in the Derby and the Preakness.</p>
        <p>Captain Steve is scheduled to be ridden by Corey Nakatani, who is recovering from a fractured thumb and who had yet to return by the draw for post positions here today.</p>
        <p>Captain Steve, who is the 3-1 second choice, and Commendable, who is coupled with Impeachment at 4-1, are the only Grade I winners in the field. Scatuorchio is hoping More Than Ready will join them Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I think he deserves to be in that category,'' Scatuorchio said of the Todd Pletcher-trained colt, who has six victories, three seconds and a third in 12 career starts.</p>
        <p>Also entered were Thistyranthasclass, winner of four straight at Monmouth; Dixie Union, who was one of the top 2-year-olds last year before sustaining a chipped knee in the Breeders Cup Juvenile; Kiss a Native; Mercaldo; and Milwaukee Brew, winner of the Ohio Derby.</p>
        <p>Dixie Union, trained by Richard Mandella, won four of his six starts last year. After undergoing surgery to remove the chip, he made a successful return in an allowance race last May, then finished second in his next two starts.</p>
        <p>''I am optimistic he will fulfill the promise he showed last year, but I've been around long enough to know these things don't always work out the way you'd like,'' Mandella said.</p>
