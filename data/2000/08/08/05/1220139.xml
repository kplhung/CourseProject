        <p>Pentagon officials today rebutted Gov. George W. Bush's assertion that 2 of the Army's 10 active divisions were not able to report for duty.</p>
        <p>In accepting the Republican presidential nomination in Philadelphia on Thursday, Mr. Bush sharply criticized the Clinton administration's stewardship of the military and specifically cited the inability of two Army divisions to be ready for war if needed.</p>
        <p>''If called on by the commander in chief today, two entire divisions of the Army would have to report, 'Not ready for duty, sir,' '' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>The Army released a statement today disputing the assertion, although without citing the governor by name. ''The Army affirmed today that all 10 of its divisions are combat ready and able to answer the nation's call,'' it said.</p>
        <p>Army officials said that last fall two divisions were classified in the war plans as unable to fulfill their missions. They said that did not reflect shortages in equipment or training, even though the military has shrunk by more than a third since the end of the cold war, but rather that they were deployed to the peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo.</p>
        <p>Since then the Pentagon has altered the war plans to give divisions more time to withdraw and redeploy if war breaks out.</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also disputed Mr. Bush's assertion. But he said the armed services still faced budget shortages in some areas even after the Clinton administration approved a $112 billion increase in defense spending over six years.</p>
        <p>''We haven't solved all the issues that we've got,'' General Shelton said. ''That was a good down payment, so to speak, but we're going to have to continue to fund the readiness accounts.''</p>
