        <p>The police arrested a homeless panhandler yesterday in the killings of six women in Brooklyn whose deaths stirred fear among residents of Williamsburg and nearby areas that a serial killer was in their midst.</p>
        <p>An investigator familiar with the case said DNA evidence had linked the panhandler, Vincent Johnson, 31, to the slayings, which began last summer and occurred on rooftops, in vacant lots and in apartments.</p>
        <p>Detectives from the Brooklyn North homicide task force arrested Mr. Johnson about 6:45 p.m. as he was heading across the Williamsburg Bridge from Manhattan to Brooklyn, police officials said. The arrest came less than an hour after the police held a news conference to release Mr. Johnson's picture, warn the public about him and ask for help in capturing him.</p>
        <p>In all of the killings, the women were strangled, apparently with whatever the killer had found at hand: two with their own sneaker laces, one with the drawstring from a pair of sweat pants, two with electrical cord and one with a piece of cloth, the police said. Most had arrest records for prostitution or drug-related offenses and all were found nude or partly clothed, a senior law enforcement official said.</p>
        <p>The detectives spotted Mr. Johnson while they were canvassing the Lower East Side of Manhattan and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, areas where the police said Mr. Johnson had frequented. A police official said Mr. Johnson had recently been questioned by detectives investigating the killing.</p>
        <p>A senior law enforcement official said the detectives in recent weeks had been obtaining DNA samples from possible suspects, and an investigator said DNA had conclusively linked Mr. Johnson to the crimes.</p>
        <p>By late last night, detectives were still questioning Mr. Johnson and he had not been formally charged. But the police official said the suspect ''won't be going home.''</p>
        <p>At the news conference at Police Headquarters before Mr. Johnson was arrested, Deputy Chief Joseph Cuneen said, ''A connection was made through forensic evidence, witness accounts and the modus operandi of the victims that were killed.''</p>
        <p>He called Mr. Johnson, who weighs 130 pounds and is 5 foot 3 inches tall, ''extremely dangerous,'' but could not say how the man had overpowered the victims, most of whose bodies showed no signs of a struggle.</p>
        <p>The first killing occurred on Aug. 26, 1999, and the most recent on June 22, the police said. The victims ranged in age from 21 to 48.</p>
        <p>In two cases, the bodies were found on rooftops in Williamsburg, and in two others, they were found inside apartments in Bedford-Stuyvesant. One woman was found slain in a utility room beneath the Brooklyn approach to the Williamsburg Bridge, and in the most recent case, the victim was found on a mattress in a vacant lot in Williamsburg.</p>
        <p>At the news conference yesterday afternoon, Chief Cuneen said Mr. Johnson, who also uses the name Vinceny, had frequented homeless shelters on the Lower East Side and had also spent time in the two Brooklyn neighborhoods where the killings had occurred.</p>
        <p>''He seems to panhandle a lot, he is homeless, he moves around, he uses the trains,'' Chief Cuneen said. He said Mr. Johnson had seven previous arrests on minor charges including low-level drug offenses, criminal trespassing and subway fare beating. Most recently, he was arrested twice in March on drug charges, spending five days in jail in the first case and eight in the second, according to city Correction Department officials.</p>
        <p>Last October, the police confirmed that they were investigating a string of murders in northern Brooklyn. But Williamsburg residents had concluded weeks before that the first two murders in their neighborhood had been committed by the same man. Alerted by word of mouth and frightened, neighbors adjusted their lives to avoid a killer they believed was stalking their streets.</p>
        <p>Many women stopped leaving their apartments at night. Some began to walk only in pairs or groups, even by day. Others kept their children cooped up.</p>
        <p>The first of the six women to be slain was Vivian Caraballo, 26,  whose body was found on Aug. 26 lying face down in the elevator room on the roof of 237 South Second Street in Williamsburg. She had been strangled with a piece of cloth. Less than a month later, on Sept. 16, the body of Joanna Feliciano was found on the roof of 171 South Fourth Street in Williamsburg. Ms. Feliciano, 35, was lying face up on the roof and had been strangled with speaker wire and sneaker laces.</p>
        <p>The next victim, Rhonda Tucker, 21, was found dead inside her apartment on Park Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant just nine days later. She had been strangled with the drawstring from her pants.</p>
        <p>The fourth victim, Katrina Niles, 34, was found after another nine-day interval. Ms. Niles was discovered in her apartment on Marcy Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. She had been strangled with an electrical cord and her throat had been slashed.</p>
        <p>The fifth victim, who has not been identified, was found in a large storage room underneath the Williamsburg Bridge approach ramp by firefighters responding to a small rubbish fire that had apparently been set by homeless people. The victim had been strangled with an electrical cord. The police are unsure when she was killed.</p>
        <p>The last victim, Patricia Sullivan, 48, was found strangled with her sneaker laces June 22 in a vacant lot on Marcy Avenue in Williamsburg.</p>
