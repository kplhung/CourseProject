      <abstract>
        <p>Gary Maranga letter urges city not to push through proposed park on Brooklyn waterfront (July 29 article) without a lot more consultation with the community</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Without question, the once legendary and since neglected Brooklyn waterfront deserves transformation into a world-class park (editorial, July 29). But there is warranted concern by community residents who would like to see a realistic analysis of the costs, specific information on what kinds of recreational uses are envisioned, and a plan to ensure equitable access to the park.</p>
        <p>There has not been sufficient contextual and historical analysis of the proposal -- in part, I realize, to preserve political and financial momentum. More detailed information would allow the community to decide, for example, whether it would like to have a central pedestrian bridge for access.</p>

        <p>Brooklyn deserves the best park money can buy without aspects of its design being compromised by political timetables.</p>
