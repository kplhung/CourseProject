        <p>The Republican Party signaled a shift in attitude toward cities when it chose Philadelphia for this week's national convention. The party in recent years has used big urban centers as metaphors of moral decay and examples of faulty Democratic stewardship. But the choice of Philadelphia revealed the G.O.P.'s intent to abandon an anti-urban rhetoric that had proved alienating to moderate suburban voters.</p>
        <p>It also reflects a growing awareness among Republicans like Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey that urban centers are crucial to state economies and must be recovered, even if the up-front costs are great. In attempting to rebuild crucial city centers, Mr. Ridge and Mrs. Whitman have both moved beyond the traditional Republican gospel that views local control as sacred and intervention from above as political heresy.</p>
        <p>The need for strong, state-level intervention has become especially apparent to Governor Ridge, who has been faced with some of the most stubborn redevelopment problems in the country -- not just in Philadelphia, which is rebounding after 40 years of decline, but also in the neighboring city of Chester, an industrial powerhouse in the 1950's and 60's that has gone largely untouched by the recovery and was until recently in danger of becoming a ghost town. I grew up in Chester during the boom years and went back to visit during this week's convention. The city has begun to inch forward, with new roads, housing and infrastructure, but only after heavy, heavy lifting by the state government in Harrisburg.</p>
        <p>Chester was the site of William Penn's first landing in the new colony of Pennsylvania in 1682, and became a successful mill town soon afterward. It boomed in the 1940's, when the war-stoked economy spawned steel mills, shipyards, textile mills and a range of heavy industries that made Chester a magnet for the great migration of black people moving into the industrial North from the rural South. Chester's Sun Shipyard employed 40,000 people from around the region, in a city whose population totaled a mere 66,000. But the yard lost roughly 10,000 jobs per decade and then closed in the 1980's, with catastrophic effect on Chester and its surrounding municipalities. Skilled laborers fled as quickly as they could, leaving behind the poor, who turned in great numbers to the drug trade.</p>
        <p>The decay was worsened by a corrupt and long-lived Republican machine that brought graft and administrative ineptitude to new lows. The machine's founder was the legendary Republican boss John J. McClure, a natty dresser in a vest and high buttoned shoes whose power in Chester and surrounding Delaware County rivaled Boss Richard Daley's in Chicago. McClure was a Republican kingmaker who helped to choose Pennsylvania governors and to whom even Richard Nixon paid homage as an aspiring president. McClure ruled, through patronage and punishment, from 1930 to his death in 1965.</p>
        <p>His successor was Jack Nacrelli, a tough machine politician who led Chester as mayor from 1968 to 1979, when he was convicted of racketeering. He returned from jail to dominate the city into the 1980's. According to a 1991 report from the Pennsylvania State Crime Commission, which investigated organized crime throughout the state, Mr. Nacrelli exercised his most intensive patronage efforts through the school board, which quickly deteriorated.</p>
        <p>The Republican machine was impervious to state intervention into the 1990's. But faced with enormous decay, mounting crime and a corrupt school system that has consistently ranked at or near the bottom in the state, Governor Ridge has led state intervention on several fronts. Once Chester was declared in distress, the state took over its fiscal affairs, including economic development, and has overseen everything from rebuilding city sewer systems to housing redevelopment to building new roads to actually buying a building for the Police Department and replacing its rundown cars.</p>
        <p>Public housing projects have been torn down and replaced with the first new housing built in the city in decades. Chester has seen the first glimmers of post-industrial business, with one new high-tech park just opened and others on the drawing board.</p>
        <p>The hollowed-out school system poses the steepest challenge of all. At the governor's instigation, the legislature has passed a radical new plan that allows the state to dissolve the school system if it wishes, replacing it with a charter system or any other system of its choosing. Results from the new legislation have yet to be seen. But the system is coming under close fiscal scrutiny for the first time in at least 50 years.</p>
        <p>The giant cranes over the long-dead shipyard still stand rusting and unmanned, a testament to prosperity gone by. But redevelopment plans are under way for the first time in memory and there are other encouraging signs of revival -- police cars that actually run, sewers that drain the streets, and street signs in vast stretches of the city that had none.  The irony of the moment is that the rebuilding effort in this city and others has fallen to Republicans, who have historically shunned this kind of intervention, leaving fallen cities like Chester to the mercy of the market.</p>
