        <p>Lynne Taylor-Corbett admits that her first reaction was ''No!'' when she was asked to create a new version of Carl Orff's ''Carmina Burana'' for the Carolina Ballet in Raleigh, N.C., where she was recently named to a five-year term as principal guest choreographer. In the 1950's and 60's, monks seemed to thunder across just about every ballet stage in Europe and the United States to the immensely popular Orff setting of racy Latin songs from a German monastery. But that was the choice of Raleigh audiences surveyed by the Carolina troupe.</p>
        <p>Robert Weiss, the director of the two-year-old Carolina Ballet, and the choreographer once envisioned ''Carmina Burana'' as ''sort of a live 'Fantasia,' '' he said. No longer interested in that idea, Ms. Taylor-Corbett will create a version that takes place today on Wall Street.</p>

        <p>Lynne Taylor-Corbett admits that her first reaction was ''No!'' when she was asked to create a new version of Carl Orff's ''Carmina Burana'' for the Carolina Ballet in Raleigh, N.C., where she was recently named to a five-year term as principal guest choreographer. In the 1950's and 60's, monks seemed to thunder across just about every ballet stage in Europe and the United States to the immensely popular Orff setting of racy Latin songs from a German monastery. But that was the choice of Raleigh audiences surveyed by the Carolina troupe.</p>
        <p>Robert Weiss, the director of the two-year-old Carolina Ballet, and the choreographer once envisioned ''Carmina Burana'' as ''sort of a live 'Fantasia,' '' he said. No longer interested in that idea, Ms. Taylor-Corbett will create a version that takes place today on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>''I read the text and it was so general,'' said Ms. Taylor-Corbett, the creator of the Broadway musical ''Swing!'' ''Not specific, just human. I began to think of Wall Street, homelessness, issues of greed. I am going to attempt a kind of linear story about two brothers who go different ways.'' There will be live music. Mr. Weiss is insistent on that and has forged relationships with several orchestral and chamber groups in the area.''</p>
        <p>As she did in ''Swing!,'' Ms. Taylor-Corbett will incorporate some soloists into the story as characters. ''If a wonderful singer is singing, I like to see the face,'' she said. Her ''Carmina Burana'' will close a full evening of her choreography to be presented in April, an exciting first for her, she said. Ms. Taylor-Corbett heads south next week to begin work on the ballet with the company's 28 dancers. ''This is an amazing opportunity to write a play within an existing piece of great music,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Long Runs Are Ending</p>
        <p>Andrew Asnes and Francie Huber, two of Paul Taylor's most engaging and gifted dancers, will leave the company this month after a final performance next Saturday at Lincoln Center Out of Doors. ''I just hope I don't cry so much that I screw the whole thing up,'' said Ms. Huber, who is 39 and has performed with the company for 13 years.</p>
        <p>It was time, she said, to spend more time with her husband, Emile Mourad, a businessman: ''We've both had a great 13 years with Paul Taylor. But it's one of those things you can't do forever.'' Ms. Huber has ''a million plans and no plans'' for the future, she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Asnes, who is 35 and has been dancing for Mr. Taylor for 11 years, has a few short films he wants to make ''in the style of music videos, which is a great way to start directing.'' Friends in Hollywood are primed, he said, to help if the films are any good. He'd like to try his hand at Broadway performing, too. Mr. Asnes will also choreograph and perform in a piece with John Selya in September at Pace Downtown Theater in a program called ''In the Company of Men.''</p>
        <p>''Why am I leaving?'' Mr. Asnes said. ''I just got to the point where I felt I've been doing this long enough and needed to move on. I love the dancing. But the traveling has got to the point where I didn't want that to be my lifestyle. If you put it all together, we tour 20 weeks a year.'' Dancing with Mr. Taylor may have prepared Mr. Asnes well for the future. ''The great thing about dancing for Paul is that his best works take you on a journey as a performer,'' Mr. Asnes said. ''You start one place, you end a different place.''</p>
        <p>Liturgical Ecstasy</p>
        <p>It is too late to register for the workshops in liturgical dance that will be a large part of ''Dance the Vision and Make It Plain,'' a four-day conference that opens on Wednesday at the Rev. Dr. Floyd Flake's Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in Jamaica, Queens. The workshops are full, having drawn more than 600 participants from across the nation. But those interested in watching liturgical dance, a form that incorporates increasingly sophisticated choreography with a kind of selfless ecstasy rarely seen on concert dance stages, will find plenty to see at worship services at 7:45 each evening.
