        <p>Randy Johnson is everything Rick Reed is not. Scraggly curls dangle from Johnson's Arizona Diamondbacks cap and fastballs sizzle from his left arm. The right-handed Reed closely crops what little hair he has, and his fastballs have none of Johnson's zip.</p>
        <p>Tonight at Bank One Ballpark, there was another difference: Johnson was battered and Reed was brilliant. With seven and two-third innings of numbing precision, Reed pitched the Mets to a 6-1 victory. The Mets have won nine of their last 10 games, and have beaten Johnson the last three times he has faced them.</p>

        <p>Randy Johnson is everything Rick Reed is not. Scraggly curls dangle from Johnson's Arizona Diamondbacks cap and fastballs sizzle from his left arm. The right-handed Reed closely crops what little hair he has, and his fastballs have none of Johnson's zip.</p>
        <p>Tonight at Bank One Ballpark, there was another difference: Johnson was battered and Reed was brilliant. With seven and two-third innings of numbing precision, Reed pitched the Mets to a 6-1 victory. The Mets have won nine of their last 10 games, and have beaten Johnson the last three times he has faced them.</p>
        <p>Reed (6-2) carried a three-hit shutout into the eighth inning, and he had set down 11 hitters in a row when Kelly Stinnett singled in the eighth. Two more singles gave the Diamondbacks a run and knocked Reed from the game, but by then the Mets led comfortably.</p>
        <p>Johnson has terrorized opposing teams for years, and he is at the peak of his effectiveness. In 45 starts since last May 30, when he beat the Mets at Shea Stadium, he has a 2.14 earned run average against all other teams. But in three starts against the Mets, including the opener of last year's first playoff round, Johnson has a 6.75 E.R.A., and Arizona has lost all three games.</p>
        <p>Asked before the game why his team has had success against Johnson, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine gave a sportsmanlike answer. ''Our hits have fallen in, I guess,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The biggest reason may be the Mets' aggressiveness as a team, which runs counter to their usual approach. The Mets are among the most patient teams in the league, letting pitchers work deep counts and drawing the fourth-most walks in the National League.</p>
        <p>But when teams let Johnson get ahead in the count with his fastball, they face the task of trying to hit his slider, which is considered his best pitch. When the Mets beat Johnson in May, the Diamondbacks' catcher, Damian Miller, said he was surprised at the way the Mets swung early. But, Miller had to admit, that is how he would approach Johnson, too. Tonight, the first four Mets who put the ball in play did so on the first or second pitch they faced. All it produced was a single, pop out and two ground outs.</p>
        <p>With the bases empty and two outs in the second, Johnson fell behind Jay Payton, 2-0. The count evened at 2-2, Payton hit two foul balls, then Johnson threw another ball. On the full-count pitch, Johnson jammed Payton, breaking his bat as Payton looped a double to shallow left.</p>
        <p>It was troublesome, because it brought up Joe McEwing, who has become a nemesis of Johnson's. Reserve players like McEwing sometimes succeed against Johnson; they fill in for starters who take a well-timed day off against the dominating left-hander. Jeff Reboluet filled this role with Baltimore, when Johnson pitched for Seattle.</p>
        <p>McEwing got his first career hit off Johnson, in 1998, and had two doubles and a homer off him this May. With the pitcher on deck, Johnson pitched carefully to McEwing, and fell behind, 3-0. His 3-1 pitch was a fastball down in the zone -- a good pitch, it seemed, but McEwing drilled it to the gap in right-center for a run-scoring double that put the Mets ahead, 1-0.</p>
        <p>The Mets singled twice off Johnson in the third until Todd Zeile, who is 0 for 10 in his career against Johnson, saw three pitches and fanned on a slider to end the inning.</p>
        <p>But in the fourth, the bottom of the Mets' order bedeviled Johnson again. Benny Agbayani smoked a slider into the left-field corner for a double. Payton swung at a first-pitch slider and drove it to right field for a single, putting runners at the corners.</p>
        <p>McEwing stood in, and again Johnson suffered. His first two pitches were balls, and McEwing drove the third to right field for a sacrifice fly, putting the Mets ahead, 2-0. Payton took second on a sacrifice and third on a wild pitch, and Mike Bordick walked.</p>
        <p>That brought up Derek Bell, who looked utterly helpless while striking out in his first two at-bats off Johnson. This was Johnson's escape hatch, but he could not take it. He fell behind Bell, and when the count evened at 2-2, he missed badly with a high fastball to run the count full. Bell hung tough, fouling off three pitches before bouncing a routine grounder to short that should have ended the inning.</p>
        <p>Tony Womack bobbled the ball, and by the time he recovered and threw to first, Bell had crossed the bag and Payton had scored. Johnson was clearly shaken -- he missed inside on four straight pitches to Edgardo Alfonzo, bringing up Mike Piazza with the bases loaded and inviting disaster.</p>
        <p>Piazza has been lethal with the bases loaded, and this time was no different. He fouled off two pitches with two strikes, then lashed a two-run single to right that gave the Mets a 5-0 lead. Johnson had thrown 89 pitches, and he would throw no more: Russ Springer came in from the bullpen and the Diamondbacks finally got out of the inning.</p>
        <p>For Johnson, it was his shortest start since May 19, 1998, when he lasted three innings in a start for the Mariners.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>BENNY AGBAYANI left the game with a contusion on his left triceps muscle after being hit by a pitch from RUSS SPRINGER in the fifth inning. Agbayani was hit in the same spot three weeks ago, but he did not need X-rays and is listed as day-to-day. . . . MIKE PIAZZA improved his career average with the bases loaded to .407.</p>
