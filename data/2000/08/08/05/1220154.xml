        <p>Trumped by Rio Tinto's counteroffer, Anglo American P.L.C. ended its bid to acquire North Ltd., the Australian mining company that is one of the world's biggest producers of iron ore. Anglo, the South African mining conglomerate, bid $1.8 billion last month, topping Rio Tinto's original offer for North and setting the stage for what would have been an important acquisition for Anglo as it seeks to expand outside South Africa. But this week, Rio Tinto countered with an offer that was nearly 11 percent higher and Anglo's board decided the company could not justify raising the price further.</p>
