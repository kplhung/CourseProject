        <p>Surrounded by three generations of the royal family, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother celebrated her 100th birthday today waving to cheering well-wishers from the Buckingham Palace balcony where she had marked the end of World War II and helped lead national rejoicing on other occasions.</p>
        <p>More than 40,000 people thronged the Mall as she rode by in a horse-drawn carriage garlanded with flowers in the gold and blue colors of her stable. Clutching small Union Jacks, many of them took up vantage points on the pedestal of the Victoria Memorial, which honors the woman who was queen on Aug. 4, 1900, when Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was born in Glamis Castle in Scotland.</p>

        <p>Surrounded by three generations of the royal family, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother celebrated her 100th birthday today waving to cheering well-wishers from the Buckingham Palace balcony where she had marked the end of World War II and helped lead national rejoicing on other occasions.</p>
        <p>More than 40,000 people thronged the Mall as she rode by in a horse-drawn carriage garlanded with flowers in the gold and blue colors of her stable. Clutching small Union Jacks, many of them took up vantage points on the pedestal of the Victoria Memorial, which honors the woman who was queen on Aug. 4, 1900, when Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was born in Glamis Castle in Scotland.</p>
        <p>Her grandson, Charles, the Prince of Wales, 51, sat by her side as the coach entered the palace grounds to the sound of a 41-gun salute and the strains of ''God Save the Queen.''</p>
        <p>Minutes later the band of the Coldstream Guards struck up ''Happy Birthday to You,'' and she emerged from the darkness of the curtained doorway onto the sunny balcony hung with gold and burgundy draping with her daughters Queen Elizabeth II, 74, and Princess Margaret, 69, and 25 other members of her immediate family, including her two great-grandsons, Princes William, 18, and Harry, 15.</p>
        <p>Her day had begun with the arrival of a royal postman at her Clarence House residence just off the Mall bearing a ceremonial card that the queen daily sends to her subjects who are turning 100. One of 12 such cards delivered across the country today, the queen mother's was the only one to carry a personal greeting and to be signed not with the formal ''Elizabeth R'' but with ''Lilibet,'' the queen's family name since childhood.</p>
        <p>The festivities capped weeks of commemorations that have included full dress parades, Royal Air Force flyovers, pageant-filled church services, and ''God Bless You Ma'am'' tabloid headlines. Editorials have credited her with having saved the monarchy from perils ranging from the abdication of her brother-in-law Edward VIII in 1936 to the bombing of Buckingham Palace during World War II to the dysfunctional family behavior of modern-day Windsors.</p>
        <p>Her first duty as queen was taming the stammering rages of her husband, the newly crowned King George VI, and it set the tone for her job ever since -- steadying the pulse of the crisis-prone royal family.</p>
        <p>She is generally regarded as the most popular royal, and it is difficult to imagine the image-makers who have been hard at work combating the declining popularity of the other family members spinning any better presentation of the queen mother than the one she herself created over 75 years of being in the public eye.</p>
        <p>There is no more endearing sight to tradition-minded Britons than her tilted head, ready smile and girlish waves. She is seen as a favorite grandmother, surrounded by her pet corgis, open and approachable, with a love of the blustery British outdoors, a knowing eye for the daily racing form and a famous fancy for gin and mischievous dinner party chatter.</p>
        <p>She lives in high style in Clarence House with a staff of 50, and while her spending habits have provoked some grousing, they have continued unchecked. ''Who would want to be the Coutts bank manager who forecloses on a centenarian national institution?'' explained Andrew Roberts, an author of political histories.</p>
        <p>While she never gave interviews or otherwise let the outside world into her life, she became a figure the public embraced, particularly during the blitz when she visited London's East End to observe the damage for herself and to try to lift the spirits of besieged Londoners. In an oft-cited comment, she inspected the debris of some Buckingham Palace buildings that had been hit by Nazi planes and said: ''I'm glad we have been bombed. It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.''</p>
        <p>The king and queen became symbols of the resistance, she negotiating the rubble in high heels and pearls, and he dauntingly military in his navy officer's uniform. She proclaimed the family's intention to ride out the war in Britain, and she let the palace information minister put out word that she was practicing shooting a revolver. Today she remains a living link to a time that is legendary in British history.</p>
        <p>George VI died of lung cancer in 1952 at age 56, and Elizabeth, then 51, had to adjust to becoming the mother of a monarch rather than the wife of one. A steely traditionalist, she forcefully moved to end the love affair between Princess Margaret and Group Capt. Peter Townsend, a palace equerry who was in the process of divorce. More recently, she sided with Charles in his marital dispute with Princess Diana. Diana retaliated for the queen mother's disdain by telling a biographer that she was ''the chief leper in the leper colony.''</p>
        <p>Elizabeth was born to wealth and privilege, daughter of the 14th Earl of Strathmore, and the medieval family castle in Scotland is the setting for much of Macbeth. She was married in 1923 to Albert, known as ''Bertie,'' and the couple became the Duke and Duchess of York. His older brother David was the heir to the throne and would become the future Edward VIII. Though the brothers lived strikingly different lives -- one at home with his wife and two daughters, the other out on the town in silken evening wear -- they were close friends until the arrival of Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee who was to cause the soon-to-be King Edward to abdicate 11 months into his reign in 1936.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth was never to forgive Wallis Simpson, years later frostily referring to her as ''the lowest of the low,'' and insisting that she and her husband, by then the Duke of Windsor, spend the rest of their lives in exile. But her primary preoccupation was restoring the good name of the monarchy and shoring up her husband after he became king, helping him overcome his crippling stutter and gain the confidence to make public addresses.</p>
        <p>The queen mother is credited with trying to associate the royal family with the common British family, laying the foundation for the current effort to make the monarchy less remote and more personable. She was the first royal to stroll up to crowd barriers and greet the public in what has now become the common practice called ''walkabout.''</p>
        <p>She moved gingerly through today's ceremonies, helping herself along with two walking sticks, beaming her signature smile and continually waving at the festive crowds.</p>
        <p>As at so many occasions involving British royalty, many of the most enthusiastic celebrators today were Americans. One of them, Connie Missinger, 47, a librarian from St. Louis, said: ''I came here especially for the birthday. I came here last year and had such a wonderful time that I thought I would love to come again. She is a very special person.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 9, 2000, Wednesday  A picture caption on Saturday about the 100th birthday of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother misidentified three members of the British royal family. It reversed the identifications of Prince Andrew's daughters Eugenie, who was third from left, and Beatrice, fourth from left, who was standing in front of her father. And the woman at the far right was Princess Michael of Kent, not the Duchess of Kent.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 12, 2000, Saturday  An article on Aug. 5 about the 100th birthday of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother misspelled the surname of a woman from St. Louis who was visiting London and praised the celebrations. She is Connie Nisinger, not Missinger.</p>
