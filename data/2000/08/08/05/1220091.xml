        <p>Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer, reported a 17 percent drop in second-quarter profits yesterday as more people sought increasingly costlier treatment. But it said it was moving along on sweeping changes aimed at improving business.</p>
        <p>''We recognize that we must remake our model to better serve employers and consumers and improve relationships with physicians and hospitals,'' said William H. Donaldson, Aetna's chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donaldson said Aetna had begun increasing prices for managed care coverage and giving regional managers greater authority in dealing with costs and pricing. For consumers, he said, Aetna was trying to make its services easier to use.</p>
        <p>''The intent,'' Mr. Donaldson said, ''is to eliminate those policies and procedures that may have no positive effect in terms of either monitoring quality or managing costs -- the so-called hassle factor.''</p>
        <p>The earnings for the second quarter, excluding charges, fell to $134 million, or 94 cents a share, down from $160.9 million, or $1.03 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Aetna attributed the decline mainly to higher-than-expected costs for treating patients.</p>
        <p>The results were better than the lowered average profit predictions by analysts of 88 cents a share, but far worse than the original consensus estimate of $1.20 before Aetna said in mid-July that it would not meet that target.</p>
        <p>Investors responded by bidding the share price up by $1.187, to $59.50. But whether Aetna, which last month sold its financial services and international units, can pull itself together and prosper over the long run in an extremely competitive business is a matter of debate among those who follow the company.</p>
        <p>Todd B. Richter, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, says Aetna is doing too little, too late.</p>
        <p>''They are starting to do things now that other people in the business have been doing over a long period of time,'' Mr. Richter said. ''And doing this stuff today is much more difficult than it was several years ago.''</p>
        <p>Industry experts say that Aetna is relying heavily on increases in prices to turn the company around.</p>
        <p>''The business needs to be shrunk and then rebuilt,'' Mr. Richter said. ''Trying to fix a business with price increases is not a panacea.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, he said, price increases poorly executed can be self-defeating. ''Unless price increases are implemented with surgical precision,'' he said, ''they can destroy the risk pool of an insurer, meaning in any book of insurance business you've got customers that are very profitable and customers that lose money for you. If you raise prices too aggressively on those profitable customers, they will leave and you will be left with only the unprofitable customers.''</p>
        <p>Studying the same data, Tom Burnett, the president of Merger Insight, a financial research firm in New York, reaches a far different conclusion. ''The way we see it,'' he said, ''Aetna is beginning to get its arms around the problem.''</p>
        <p>A big part of the problem has been the integration of three big health insurance companies -- U.S. Healthcare, Nylcare and Prudential Health Care -- into one smoothly running machine. With investors angry about the company's poor results and lagging share price, Richard L. Huber, the architect of the acquisition strategy, stepped down in February.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donaldson, one of the founding partners of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, has been overseeing the company since. He acknowledges that he is no health care expert. But he negotiated the sale of the nonhealth-care units to the big Dutch banking and insurance company, ING, and he is leading the search for a chief operating officer.</p>
        <p>''They recognize their problems,'' Mr. Burnett said. And, having sold the businesses that have nothing to do with health insurance, he said, ''they're going to be able to mount a dedicated, focused effort toward improving their health care operations.''</p>
        <p>In a conference call with analysts yesterday, Aetna said it had narrowed its search for a chief executive. One person under consideration, according to people close to the search, is John W. Rowe, the president and chief executive of Mount Sinai NYU Health.</p>
