        <p>New Jersey health investigators have been unable to pinpoint the source of E. coli bacteria that fatally poisoned a 20-month-old boy from Parsippany this week, officials said  yesterday.</p>
        <p>The baby, Nicolaus Brayton, died Tuesday of hemolytic uremic syndrome, or H.U.S., a rare and virulent effect of E. coli infection that causes severe diarrhea, inflammation of the blood vessels and kidney failure, said Dennis McGowan, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services.</p>

        <p>New Jersey health investigators have been unable to pinpoint the source of E. coli bacteria that fatally poisoned a 20-month-old boy from Parsippany this week, officials said  yesterday.</p>
        <p>The baby, Nicolaus Brayton, died Tuesday of hemolytic uremic syndrome, or H.U.S., a rare and virulent effect of E. coli infection that causes severe diarrhea, inflammation of the blood vessels and kidney failure, said Dennis McGowan, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services.</p>
        <p>The syndrome is caused in a small percentage of infections by a toxin emitted from a potentially deadly strain of E. coli known as O157:H7, said Thomas Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>But officials do not know how the child was infected. ''At present, we haven't found any evidence to link this case to any product, any particular restaurant, or any other cases in the state,'' Mr. McGowan said.</p>
        <p>After his son's wake yesterday, Thomas Brayton, Nicolaus's father, said he; his wife, Lorraine; Nicolaus; and Nicolaus's twin sister, Samantha, all came down with gastrointestinal disorders within days of a meal at a restaurant on July 23.</p>
        <p>He declined to say where the family had eaten before they became sick, or what they had eaten, but said Nicolaus ate the biggest portion of the food that all family members had sampled. He declined to identify it. ''I don't want to cause any panic that is unjustified,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Only Nicolaus was stricken with H.U.S., Mr. McGowan said. Mr. Brayton said he, his wife and Samantha were all recovering.</p>
        <p>After some diarrhea within days of the meal, Nicolaus, too, appeared to be feeling better, his father said. ''Last Thursday, he was perfectly healthy, a skipping, fun-loving little boy running around,'' he recalled. On Friday, July 28, Nicolaus became irritable and lost his appetite, and by Saturday his health had begun a rapid deterioration, Mr. Brayton said.</p>
        <p>Samantha was treated at Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park, N.Y., and tested positive for E. coli yesterday, but she is home now,  Mr. Brayton said.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, officials are investigating a recent outbreak of E. coli infection in Wisconsin. In the last two weeks, more than 50 people became ill after eating at two Sizzler restaurants in the Milwaukee area. One victim, a 3-year-old girl, died, and Gabrielle Cetta, a 4-year-old girl from Long Island who was visiting grandparents, became seriously ill.</p>
        <p>Gabrielle was admitted in critical condition this week to Schneider Children's Hospital, a division of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center. Elaine Wohl, a hospital spokeswoman, said yesterday that Gabrielle was stable and improving.</p>
        <p>Health experts say there is no apparent link in any of the cases to a recall on July 29 of about 347,000 pounds of ground beef packaged and distributed July 11 by the Moyer Packing Company, of Souderton, Pa.  About two weeks after the shipment, federal meat inspectors reported some of the meat might have been contaminated by E. coli O157:H7, the department said. Moyer Packing issued the recall four days later.</p>
        <p>The meat was shipped to wholesalers in 11 states, including New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, and was possibly reground and repackaged by retailers, the United States Department of Agriculture said last weekend. While some of the meat was shipped to Wisconsin, Carol Blake, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department, said that the department knew of no cases of E. coli poisoning related to the meat.</p>
        <p>In another development involving E. coli, the State Health Department Thursday advised residents of Schuylerville, N.Y., about 40 miles north of Albany, to boil their tap water after a sample of the town's drinking water tested positive for the bacteria. The particular strain has not been identified, and no illnesses have been reported, said Claire Pospisil, a department spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Schuylerville's water supply comes from streams that flow through the surrounding countryside into a catchment area, Ms. Pospisil said. The water is chlorinated, but Schuylerville is under state orders to improve purification by installing a filtration system, she said.</p>
        <p>Schuylerville is about five miles west of the Washington County Fairgrounds, where two people died and hundreds were made ill by E. coli last August and September in the worst outbreak of the disease in New York State history. The state believes that runoff from cow manure or sewage from a leaking septic tank contaminated ground water in the fairgrounds' eight wells. The water was used last year, untreated, for food preparation and drinking.</p>
        <p>The Washington County Fairgrounds and those in six other counties have now installed new systems providing treated water, Ms. Pospisil said.</p>
