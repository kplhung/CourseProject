        <p>There is always a new player or two making his debut in a team's first preseason game, and this year the Giants are hardly being furtive about who will be in the showcase during tonight's game against the Chicago Bears at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>Asked whom he was eager to see perform tonight, Giants Coach Jim Fassel did not hesitate with his answer.</p>
        <p>''Ron Dayne,'' Fassel said. ''Getting Ron the ball a lot is a priority.''</p>
        <p>Dayne, the team's first-round draft pick at running back, will play regularly with the first-team offense and remain in the game even after most of the starters leave after the first quarter. Fassel said he had no set number of times he wants Dayne to carry the ball, but he estimated that 10 rushing attempts would be ideal.</p>
        <p>As a matter of protocol, rookies are not supposed to be handed starting jobs, so Dayne may not start the game. With the second-year running back Joe Montgomery probably out with a badly cut lip, Tiki Barber may get the starting nod. But Dayne will not be on the sideline for long.</p>
        <p>''We just need to get Ron the experience,'' Fassel said of last year's Heisman Trophy winner. ''We need to give him a feel for things and let him get comfortable. He's doing well, and I'm excited to see him play, along with some of the other younger guys like Ron Dixon. And I want to see how our offensive line plays together, too.''</p>
        <p>Dixon is the wide receiver from Lambuth University. The third-round draft pick has had such a good camp he has already vaulted over the third-year wide receiver Brian Alford on the depth chart. Dixon is the fourth receiver behind Amani Toomer, Ike Hilliard and Joe Jurevicius, who has also been impressive in training camp.</p>
        <p>The Giants' offensive line has been remade with three veteran free-agent signings -- center Dusty Zeigler, left guard Glenn Parker and left tackle Lomas Brown -- and with Luke Petitgout having moved to right tackle from left guard.</p>
        <p>Dayne's patient running style -- he tends to pause in the backfield before choosing his angle of attack -- is predicated on a familiarity with his blockers' styles and techniques. Dayne has been working with the first and second units in training camp, but he seems more comfortable with the starters than with the second unit, which is inexperienced and young.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking forward to my first game in Giants Stadium,'' Dayne said. ''I always look forward to every football game. That's the fun of football. But it'll be especially good to go against another team, too.''</p>
        <p>Fassel said quarterback Kerry Collins would not play much more than the first quarter, with the new backup Jason Garrett playing the second and third quarters. The third-string quarterback Mike Cherry will probably play most of the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Fassel said defensive tackle Keith Hamilton (hamstring strain), defensive end Michael Strahan (back stiffness), safety Shaun Williams (toe sprain) and offensive guard-tackle Mike Rosenthal (sore shoulder) would not play tonight. Fassel said he would decide before the game whether linebacker Mike Barrow, who sprained his right knee Wednesday, would dress for the game.</p>
