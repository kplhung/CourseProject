        <p>Shukria Akhtar wants to be a doctor when she grows up. Tidy in the loose tunic, slacks and scarf prescribed by her Muslim religion, she seems temperamentally well suited for the job. She is gentle, caring and patient. There is one hitch: she is 10 years old, going into fifth grade, but  still reading and calculating at kindergarten level.</p>
        <p>So in this monsoon summer in New York City, Shukria is spending most of her days in a second-floor classroom at Public School 19 in the East Village. Between stealing glances out the window to check on prospects for swimming, she haltingly sounds out double vowels and adds 6 plus 3. Shukria might save lives some day. But only, her teacher says, if her life can be turned around first.</p>
        <p>Shukria, who came to the United States from Pakistan three years ago, is among 327,000 New York City public school children in kindergarten through 12th grade who are so far behind in their studies this year that their teachers have either urged or ordered them to go to summer school. Many of those in elementary school and middle school are at risk of being held back, in one of the most radical efforts to end the system's traditional policy of automatically promoting students.</p>
        <p>Shukria's class is a mix of immigrant children still shaky in their new language -- some after being illiterate in their old language -- and  native-born classmates hobbled by poverty, by broken families, by emotional problems, by parents who are too drained after work to take them to the library or help with homework.</p>
        <p>Their teacher has five weeks -- from July 6 to Aug. 10 -- to reverse or at least slow down the runaway train to becoming a dropout that Shukria and many of her summer school classmates are on. When the summer session began, the chances of success seemed as remote as Shukria's were of realizing her dream of being a doctor. But as the days have gone by, there have been signs of progress: Leonda's sudden grasp, after nine months of trying, of how to round off numbers; Ting's carefully written autobiography; Cecily's increasing awareness of the ''ed'' endings on words in the past tense.</p>
        <p>Part of the reason for the progress is the small number of students -- 15 -- in the class, a result of the otherwise troublingly high truancy rate in summer school.</p>
        <p>The class started out with all the drawbacks of a school in a poor urban neighborhood. Their teacher, Greta Bouterse, is fairly new to the profession and has only provisional state certification. Tests administered on the first day of summer school showed reading levels ranging from kindergarten to fifth grade, yet one teacher working with a single curriculum was expected to reach them all.</p>
        <p>Miss Bouterse had previously taught only 4 of the 15 children attending her class. Normally, she said, it takes from September to December to win the trust of her students; this time, she would have to do it within days.</p>
        <p>Before summer school opened, Harold O. Levy, the schools chancellor, warned that teachers could not be expected to make up for a year of failure in five weeks. Making his rounds at P.S. 19 one day, the principal, Ivan Kushner, wondered if Mr. Levy had been wrong. Mr. Kushner marveled at how calm and focused the children were. ''This is the answer,'' he said. ''You don't need Sylvan Learning and all that other stuff. This is like a private school.''</p>
        <p>Discovering the Children</p>
        <p>On the first day of summer school, Miss Bouterse arrived in room 4-205 to find an ethnic panoply. There was Ting Ting Chen, the elegant, birdlike Chinese girl, whose comprehension and abstract thinking far outstrips her ability to express herself in English. Across from Ting sat Sayyid Choudhury, who emigrated from Bangladesh 10 months ago and has become addicted to the stock ticker of the Financial News Network on television.</p>
        <p>There was Stephen Williams, who travels 45 minutes on the No. 4 train and the L train to school, because his father believes that P.S. 19 is better than schools in the South Bronx, where they live. Stephen spent much of the day with his head on his desk, barely able to stay awake. Later, his father told Miss Bouterse that Stephen takes seizure medication, which makes him drowsy.</p>
        <p>Trying to discover something about the children besides their test scores, Miss Bouterse asked them to write down three wishes. When some children wrote down only one, she concluded that they had trouble following directions.</p>
        <p>Some, like Rahman Mohibur, revealed a strong drive to succeed. ''I wish I stayed in my country. I wish I could be president. I wish I could buy a building,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Jesenia Gomez, a quiet girl who failed fourth grade, wished for a baby. Leonda Turner showed hints of the spunky attitude and complex emotional life that would become clearer in the days ahead: ''I want to be rich. I want my family to be together.''</p>
        <p>Justin Pertuz had written: ''I like to sing.'' Looking in his direction, Miss Bouterse giggled when she found him mouthing the words to a song while dancing in his chair.</p>
        <p>By all appearances, they were ordinary children. What brought them together was that they had scored in either Level 1, the lowest level on the state reading test, or Level 2, still below standards.</p>
        <p>Using the techniques she is learning at Hunter College, where she is studying for a master's degree in education, Miss Bouterse gave the students a sight-reading test. Their ability to recognize words ranged from kindergarten level (''big, did, funny'') to fifth grade (''bracket, shred, yonder''). Sayyid was reading at the fifth-grade level, but did not understand the words he was pronouncing. His problem, Miss Bouterse concluded, was his lack of vocabulary.</p>
        <p>The math test confirmed that Sayyid's problem was verbal. He breezed through the multiple choice questions, getting all the calculations right. But on an item that asked whether minus-4 was a negative or a positive number, he confidently picked positive.  Numbers less than zero are positive, he said, and those greater than zero are negative.</p>
        <p>''If someone said, 'You're a good boy,' is that a positive or negative statement?'' Sayyid was asked. ''Negative,'' he replied.</p>
        <p>In the time that Ting took to solve more than 30 problems, showing her work in exacting detail, Brittany Aldea shaded the answer bubbles for four questions, showing no work. Confronted with dollar signs, fractions and decimal points, Shukria was completely stumped.</p>
        <p>How was Miss Bouterse going to deal with this mishmash of abilities in the days ahead? ''That's the challenge,'' she said.</p>
        <p>'Those Crazy Body Counts'</p>
        <p>On the first day of school, Mr. Kushner reported 95 out of about 150 students attending, roughly the same as the 60 percent attendance rate citywide. As elsewhere, some students at P.S. 19 are required to attend, or they will be held back; and some  have been encouraged to attend, but will be promoted anyway.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kushner was puzzled by the chancellor's embarrassment in trying to explain the low numbers citywide to the news media. But he was not surprised by the numbers themselves. The letter urging students to attend summer school was ''kind of an invitation,'' he said. He had known since June which students would not be there.</p>
        <p>''This reminds me of Vietnam,'' said Mr. Kushner, summer casual in a Hawaiian shirt. ''All those crazy body counts.''</p>
        <p>Better attendance would cause problems. If the no-shows in Miss Bouterse's class suddenly appeared, she would have 25 students instead of 15. ''This is how we planned it,'' Mr. Kushner said.</p>
        <p>Miss Bouterse was delighted by her small class. It was about half the size of her regular fourth-grade class, and she got to know the children more quickly and intimately than she had expected. The children seemed more motivated, too. Even the habitual latecomers, like Brittany, usually arrived on time.</p>
        <p>By the end of the first week, Miss Bouterse knew the abilities and quirks of every child, and could tailor the curriculum to fit. She gave Shukria handwritten sheets of double-digit addition and subtraction problems, telling her to ignore the story problems that everyone else was doing. During writing sessions, Miss Bouterse had time to give instant feedback, reading and correcting almost everyone's essay on the spot.</p>
        <p>In a class of 30, Miss Bouterse said, some children are so distracting that they cheat the other children of attention, and some children are so quiet that you forget they are there.</p>
        <p>The day lasted just four and a half hours, from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., broken into segments for math, phonics, grammar, reading and writing. The Board of Education did not provide snacks, so Miss Bouterse bought pretzels and oatmeal cookies on her own. As they ate, the children colored cardboard scraps to make a patchwork quilt about their families, the theme of the curriculum.</p>
        <p>Often, the classroom was so hushed that it sounded like a library. Only the air-conditioner blasting in one window marred the peace. During literature discussions, Miss Bouterse got in the habit of switching it off so the children could hear one another.</p>
        <p>The first time she did this, the silence was deafening. ''AaaaahhhCHOOOO!'' Leonda said, playfully feigning a sneeze to break the tension.</p>
        <p>''Clown,'' Miss Bouterse teased back.</p>
        <p>Out of a Soap Opera</p>
        <p>At the end of each day, Miss Bouterse hands out little happy-face stickers to those who have behaved, and Leonda is as eager for hers as anyone. On the first day of class, the children made up nicknames for everyone, and Miss Bouterse wrote them in colored marker on a poster that she clipped to one of several clotheslines stretched across the room. As the days go by, posters accumulate like clean laundry.</p>
        <p>Leonda's nickname, Loving Leonda, turns out to be uncannily apt. A compact, restless girl with tightly braided hair, she is always smiling or laughing. Miss Bouterse has to separate her from Justin, the would-be singer, who likes to gossip with the girls.</p>
        <p>During listening time, Miss Bouterse is reading ''Jenny Archer, Author,'' to the class. When Jenny Archer talks about watching soap operas, Leonda is the only child who can describe a soap opera with precision: ''People get sick. Car accidents. Airplane accidents,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, it seems that Leonda's life is a soap opera. For her quilt square, she colors a picture of herself as a baby, sitting in a walker, next to a tall man. ''This is my father,'' she says. ''He died.''</p>
        <p>Miss Bouterse is impressed by how absorbed the children are in Jenny Archer's story. She departs from the prescribed curriculum to propose that the children write their autobiographies, as Jenny Archer does in the book. Miss Bouterse wants them to write their real life story and then what she calls their ''unreal'' life story, just like Jenny.</p>
        <p>''Yes!'' Leonda exclaims. Fantasy books are her favorite kind, she says.</p>
        <p>She already knows what she is going to write about in her unreal autobiography. ''How my father raised from the dead.''</p>
        <p>The Substitute</p>
        <p>For her 30th birthday, Miss Bouterse, her sister and their friends spend a long weekend in Las Vegas. Miss Bouterse will miss class on Monday, and Mr. Kushner assigns Matty Billig, the reading teacher, to substitute. She knows most of the children already, Mr. Kushner explains, so she will be able to handle the class better than a complete stranger.</p>
        <p>Miss Bouterse has left behind a blow by blow schedule, written out by hand, with the comment, ''They're a good group!''</p>
        <p>Ms. Billig starts with choral reading, something that Miss Bouterse does not do. The children enjoy it, but become increasingly rowdy. Leonda blows kisses to an imaginary audience. Cecily Darby takes on the sour-mouthed, squinty-eyed expression she gets when she is thinking about being held back. Ms. Billig, who has emerald green eyes and bright red hair, keeps smiling, but her tone does not match her expression.</p>
        <p>Every time the children misbehave, Ms. Billig orders them to check the list of responsibilities hanging on the laundry line and to recite the relevant rule. They check the list, forgotten until now, a lot.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Billig hands out the graham crackers Miss Bouterse has left in her desk drawer, Stephen takes snack time as his cue to rush excitedly across the room to fetch markers, for the patchwork quilt. Ms. Billig stops him cold. ''Stephen. Can I ask a question?'' she demands. ''Why are you over there?'' As the children eat, the substitute patrols for crumbs, fretting about roaches and mice.</p>
        <p>When it's time for the math problem of the day, Sayyid writes his solution on the chalkboard. As usual, his calculations are meticulously correct, written in his ornate, Arabic-looking script. ''Are you sure you put everything in there?'' Ms. Billig asks. ''Are you sure?'' She tells the class that she was one of the graders on the state math test. Sayyid's mistake, she says, is that he put just one vertical slash through the dollar sign, when he should have put two.</p>
        <p>To Leonda, she says: ''You knew how to explain it, you just couldn't do the math right. So you should have explained it, and gotten points off for math.'' Leonda looks bemused.</p>
        <p>At noon, with just an hour to go, the class is barely under control, like a pot boiling while the lid rattles. Ms. Billig looks over at Leonda and sees that she has been washing her hands under her desk in white, sticky Elmer's glue. Leonda explains that Brittany Aldea dared her to do it. ''I believe it,'' Ms. Billig says.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, six children do not get happy-face stickers, more than ever before.</p>
        <p>The Teacher Comes Back</p>
        <p>Miss Bouterse returns from Las Vegas at 4:30 in the morning on Tuesday and barely has time to wash her face before arriving in class. She is in a good mood. Instead of the usual baby pink, she has painted her toenails a wilder shade of fuchsia. Today's ''Literacy Warmup,'' in which the children must correct grammar, spelling and punctuation, is: ''who is you're favrite entertainer i like billy crystal, RoBin Williams, and nathan LaNe, I like the People who make me lagh.''</p>
        <p>Miss Bouterse grew up in Plainview, N.J., the youngest of three sisters. She took dance lessons growing up, and she still takes classes at Chelsea Piers. Sometimes, she will pirouette while handing a child a pencil or a piece of chalk. When Leonda mastered estimation, Miss Bouterse waved her arms like Goldie Hawn in a go-go dance for joy.</p>
        <p>She realized by the time she went to college at Rutgers that she was not going to dance professionally. She came to P.S. 19 to teach an after-school program in computers and the arts, and Mr. Kushner spotted something special in her. ''I grabbed her,'' he says now, and put her in charge of a third-grade class.</p>
        <p>She acknowledges that her teaching has improved during her three years in the classroom. ''I look back at things I did my first year. . . .'' she starts to say, then stops, perhaps thinking better of confessing too much.</p>
        <p>Still Reading Below Standards</p>
        <p>One of the sore spots in Miss Bouterse's career is Cecily, whom Miss Bouterse taught as a first-year teacher. In third grade, Cecily scored below the 10th percentile in reading and in math, after accumulating weeks of absences, partly because of asthma. Miss Bouterse believed she had no choice but to hold her back, and recommended testing for special education.</p>
        <p>Cecily's mother, Linda Darby, was furious and refused to allow her to be tested. Ms. Darby recalled that she did not want her daughter to be ''labeled.'' Miss Bouterse says she was baffled by Cecily's low achievement and hoped that the testing might shed some light on how to help.</p>
        <p>Cecily repeated third grade. But two years later, she is still reading below standards, a low Level 2, on the state test.</p>
        <p>Linda Darby is a single mother working two jobs, one in the city morgue and the other at Bellevue Hospital Center. She lives in a Harlem housing project. Cecily's small room is as neat as a museum, with her toys arranged on the floor and magazine pictures of Britney Spears, Destiny's Child and other teen idols taped to the walls.</p>
        <p>But Cecily is rarely there. During the week, she stays with her grandmother on the Lower East Side, near P.S. 19; she goes home on weekends.</p>
        <p>Among her classmates, Cecily stands out like Gulliver among the Lilliputians. She was big at birth, 12 pounds, her mother says. Now 11, she could pass for 16. When Cecily was held back, ''Me and her talk,'' Ms. Darby said. ''I told her, 'Cecily, you're a strong young lady. You'll be all right with it.' And she was all right.''</p>
        <p>The High Achievers</p>
        <p>Sayyid Choudhury and Ting Ting Chen seem out of place in a summer school program that is designed to be remedial. Sayyid's father was a philosophy professor at a community college in Bangladesh, and Sayyid was a top student in his country. He keeps his awards for scholarship proudly taped to the wall of his family's two-room tenement on East 11th Street.</p>
        <p>Below the awards stands a rickety table, covered in a plastic cloth, where he and his younger sister, Zerin, take turns doing their homework. Sayyid has checked out a paperback copy of ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' from the Tompkins Square library. ''Some words is hard, so you can look in the dictionary,'' he says earnestly, gesturing toward his Bengali-English dictionary.</p>
        <p>His uncle, Raz, shares the apartment with the family. Raz, 28, has been running a convenience store on 14th Street with an older brother for seven years. Amadou Diallo peddled his wares outside the shop. Raz dabbles in day-trading, and has taught Sayyid about the stock market. ''In Bangladesh, we were rich,'' Raz says. ''We had two houses, a Jeep.'' Here, they are poor. But Sayyid's strong education in his home country gives him a strong foundation at P.S. 19.</p>
        <p>With only 10 months in the United States, Sayyid was exempt from the standardized tests. But Ting, a Chinese immigrant, scored a 1, the lowest level, on the reading test.</p>
        <p>Miss Bouterse suspects that the graders could not see past Ting's broken English and idiosyncratic grammar to her high level of thinking. ''The test does not reflect what my little Ting can do,'' she says.</p>
        <p>'This Is My Life'</p>
        <p>In late July, the students in Miss Bouterse's class turned in their ''real'' autobiographies.</p>
        <p>Sayyid's brims with masculine bravado. ''When I was five years I learned to play soccer. Seven and a half years old I learned to play cricket. . . . We got many trophies,'' he wrote. ''Now I attend summer school at Mrs. Bouterse class because I like school and I don't like to stay at home.''</p>
        <p>Cecily's exudes vulnerability. ''Then I meet new friends like Crystal but they wasn't good because I got lefted back in the third grade and they went to fourth and they acted like they didn't know me,'' she wrote breathlessly.</p>
        <p>Leonda's, scribbled on the back of another homework sheet, is full of the impish brio that so irked the substitute teacher. ''My life is just like any other child's life,'' she began. ''My brother is nice, he keeps a lot of my secrets. . . . My sister says I have big feet. My mom and brother say I have a apple head. My little sister just bother me and my teacher is the best. I know this is a boring story but this is my life.''</p>
        <p>Ting wrote four chapters, beginning with her birth by Caesarean section in China and ending with a disaster that turned out to be just a bad dream. ''One day I went to sleep. I was dreaming. I dream that I fell of the stair. It scary to me. I was felling, felling and felling.</p>
        <p>''Then when I fell at the end of the stair. My body is hurting so much.</p>
        <p>''When it hurt so much then I say ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. The I wake up and it only a dream. I went back to sleep.''</p>
        <p>Shukria's autobiography is nearly indecipherable (although her spoken English is good). She came to the United States in 1997, entering third grade in Queens, and it is not clear whether she was literate in Urdu, the language she still speaks at home. She came to P.S. 19 in the fall of 1998, and repeated fourth grade this year.</p>
        <p>Yet Shukria has learned more math in three weeks of summer school than in three years before that. She no longer gets 0 when she adds 0 to a bigger number. She has been weaned from counting on her fingers, to counting with colored tiles, to memorizing most addition combinations up to 12. She has perfected borrowing and carrying to the hundreds place.</p>
        <p>Maybe, Ms. Bouterse ventures, Shukria will go to medical school after all.</p>
