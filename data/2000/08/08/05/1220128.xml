        <p>Clyde Haberman NYC column suggests bringing back some dignity to names of those wanting to live at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue; two candidates are now known, perhaps too familiarly, as Al and W, trend that began with Jimmy Carter and could end up with candidates being known by their computer log-ons (M)</p>

        <p>IF you were among the 11 New Yorkers who watched the Republican National Convention gavel to gavel, you no doubt noticed that a running theme was the need to restore dignity to the White House.</p>
        <p>Whether the White House indeed cries out for such restoration is for you to decide. The only thought on the subject here is that one way to begin might be to bring back some dignity to the names of those wanting to live at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>

        <p>IF you were among the 11 New Yorkers who watched the Republican National Convention gavel to gavel, you no doubt noticed that a running theme was the need to restore dignity to the White House.</p>
        <p>Whether the White House indeed cries out for such restoration is for you to decide. The only thought on the subject here is that one way to begin might be to bring back some dignity to the names of those wanting to live at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
        <p>We have been reduced to a choice between a fellow who calls himself Al and a guy who is known far and wide by an initial. W. sounds like a character in a James Bond movie.</p>
        <p>Time was, not so long ago, when it was practically required that candidates at the top have names to match the gravitas of the office they sought. The major parties filled their national tickets with men who wore three names as if they were three-piece suits:</p>
        <p>Lyndon Baines Johnson. John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Dwight David Eisenhower. Richard Milhous Nixon. Hubert Horatio Humphrey. Henry Cabot Lodge. And, of course, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the only president named after a Manhattan highway.</p>
        <p>Sure, there were nicknames in that bunch. But the country was not about to be glad-handed by a Lyn Johnson or a Hank Lodge, let alone a Frankie Roosevelt. Their names were so substantial that even the initials had weight.</p>
        <p>''It was so important to Johnson that he be known as L.B.J.,'' said the historian Robert A. Caro, who is at work on the third book of his biography of the 36th president. In his new book, Mr. Caro said, he will recount what he learned from Horace Busby Jr., a longtime Johnson associate who died two months ago.</p>
        <p>As far back as 1948, while still a congressman, Johnson said, ''F.D.R.-L.B.J., F.D.R.-L.B.J. -- do you get it? What I want is for them to start thinking of me in terms of initials.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Busby told Mr. Caro: ''He was just so determined that some day he would be known as L.B.J.''</p>
        <p>And then we got Jimmy-fied.</p>
        <p>That was in the 1970's, when James Earl Carter left his peanut farm for Washington. Now, we are drenched in enough folksiness to fill a hundred cracker barrels.</p>
        <p>WE have had Bill Clinton and Al Gore and Bill Bradley and Bob Dole and Jack Kemp and Dan Quayle and Dick Cheney, to name but a few. Did you ever see anyone who screams out Richard more than somber Dick Cheney? Or who looks more like a Malcolm Stevenson Forbes Jr. than the plutocrat who presents himself as just Steve Forbes? (Not that a Clyde is about to blame anyone for ditching a name like Malcolm.)</p>
        <p>To the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., it is all part of ''a dumbing-down process'' that strips modern politics of dignity.</p>
        <p>''There was a phrase of my youth called the 'mucker pose,' '' Mr. Schlesinger said, ''and this is part of the mucker pose. You try to win people over by showing that you're one of the boys.''</p>
        <p>''And it's spreading,'' he said. ''It's contagious. Tony Blair.''</p>
        <p>Joel Silbey, a history professor at Cornell University, also takes a dim view of the just-plain-folks affect. ''I think there should be some gravitas to our leaders,'' he said. ''We should not pull them down to our level and then expect them to do great things.''</p>
        <p>You could argue that a name like George W. Bush is a throwback. But not really. That W. is not for ballast but rather to set the candidate apart from Papa.</p>
        <p>There seems to be no way out of this modern trend. ''The whole burden of trying to get elected,'' said the historian Michael Beschloss, ''is to make yourself seem open, accessible and friendly to the average voter. It's hard to see how that is done by calling yourself Albert Arnold Gore Jr.''</p>
        <p>Somehow, New York has bucked the tide a bit. The mayor holds office as Rudolph W. Giuliani, not Rudy. The Bronx borough president is Fernando Ferrer, not Freddie, his nickname. No one has yet been heard calling the city comptroller Al Hevesi.</p>
        <p>Ah, but even New York cannot escape Jimmy-itis. We have a Senate candidate who entered this world as Enrico Lazio but goes by Rick. Enrico is a fine Old Country name, ringing of Fermi and Caruso. Rick is ''Ozzie and Harriet.''</p>
        <p>And who is Rick's opponent? Hillary. That's what her campaign literature calls her. No Clinton (too much of the husband there). No Rodham (too much feminism). Just Hillary. Like Cher.</p>
        <p>So we're down to single names and single initials. Just you wait. Before long, candidates for office will be going by their computer log-ons. You heard it here first.</p>
