        <p>Todd Wichmann and Richard Owen barreled into the Procter &amp; Gamble headquarters last month and were about to head upstairs when the security guard stopped them.</p>
        <p>Waiting for permission to enter a place they had worked almost all their adult lives felt ''bizarre, weird,'' Mr. Wichmann (pronounced WICK-man) said as he fiddled with his red visitor's badge.</p>
        <p>He and Mr. Owen had just quit their jobs at P.&amp; G. to form Redox Brands Inc., a company that specializes in buying once-famous laundry and cleaning brands that giants like their former employer are discarding. Their first -- and so far only -- purchase was Procter &amp; Gamble's Oxydol laundry detergent brand, in a deal that calls for P.&amp; G. to continue to be involved in the product. The financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.</p>
        <p>In some ways, Redox's timing could not be better: behemoths like P.&amp; G., hoping to assuage Wall Street's anxiety over sagging earnings, are becoming more aggressive in dropping brands that are no longer among the market leaders.</p>
        <p>But building a strong company out of a collection of jilted labels is tough going. Other companies, notably in the food industry, have tried; few have succeeded.</p>
        <p>''Buying an orphaned brand isn't necessarily a challenge,'' said David A. Goldman, director of equity research at SunTrust Equitable Securities. ''Consolidating them into one entity that makes sense, has operational efficiencies, and has critical mass, well, that's another matter.''</p>
        <p>Besides, many industry experts say, giants like Procter &amp; Gamble do not shed brands unless they have a good reason to do so.</p>
        <p>Although P.&amp; G. would not comment on its relationship with Redox or the specifics of the deal, it said in a prepared statement that Oxydol, which represented a minute portion of company sales, ''no longer provided a strategic fit.''</p>
        <p>Oxydol was P.&amp; G.'s oldest brand of laundry detergent, introduced in 1927. While it has a long history -- it sponsored the ''Ma Perkins'' radio show, the first so-called soap opera, in 1933 -- naysayers doubt that a rich heritage convinces consumers to buy a detergent.</p>
        <p>''The question is: Is Oxydol such an ancient brand that it is valueless and not worth it to revive it?'' said Clive Chajet of Chajet Consultancy, a branding consultant in New York.  ''As far as I'm concerned, they're starting from scratch in a category where it's hard to differentiate one brand from another.''</p>
        <p>Sales of Oxydol have been sinking over the decade and are dwarfed by those of the market leader, P.&amp; G.'s Tide.</p>
        <p>Despite all this, Mr. Wichmann, 30, and Mr. Owen, 31, are convinced they will succeed. Their aim is to increase Oxydol's share of the $6 billion market for liquid and powdered detergent to 2 percent in the next five years from its current one-tenth of a percent. (By comparison, Mr. Wichmann said, Tide now has around 35 percent of the market.)</p>
        <p>Though they are dealing in an old- economy business, they say, they are helped by some new-economy factors. The expansion of contract sales makes it easier for them to hire a company to sell their products. Internet technology allows them to hold ''virtual'' meetings with business contacts, slashing travel costs.</p>
        <p>And as companies like Proctor &amp; Gamble and Unilever scramble to shed old brands, Mr. Wichmann and Mr. Owen have a steady stream of product offerings from which to choose. In addition to Oxydol, for example, P.&amp; G. recently put Biz, a bleach detergent, up for sale. (The men would not comment on whether Redox was considering acquiring it.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Wichmann, the Redox president, and Mr. Owen, the chief operating officer, also say they have two distinct tactical advantages.</p>
        <p>First, instead of buying the leader in small markets -- a model exemplified by Aurora Foods Inc., which has bought brands including Duncan Hines, Log Cabin and Van de Kamp's, with some success -- they will buy small brands in large markets. That way, they can focus on competing for customers rather than trying to expand a market.</p>
        <p>Second, they can tailor their packaging and pricing to fit the needs of smaller retailers, something that larger, bureaucratized companies cannot do.</p>
        <p>''Twenty years ago or even five years ago, there was no way to do what we're doing,'' Mr. Wichmann said. ''We want to be a virtual organization. We don't want any plants. We don't want any money going to fixed assets.''</p>
        <p>He can make such a bold statement in part because he has P.&amp; G. in his corner.</p>
        <p>Under the deal, Procter &amp; Gamble, arguably the American consumer products company with the greatest influence among retailers, will still take care of the ordering, shipping and billing systems used for Oxydol, which will continue to be made at a P.&amp; G. plant. It also has an undisclosed minority stake in the company. Redox, based in the Cincinnati suburb of West Chester, Ohio, will be making the strategic decisions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wichmann and Mr. Owen acknowledge that their former employer influences their decisions. ''Our relationship with P.&amp; G. is very important and we do live by their rules,'' Mr. Wichmann said.</p>
        <p>Though bitten by the entrepreneurial bug early on, the men were, after all, trained by the company whose employees are widely known as ''Proctoids,'' distinguished by their efficiency and obedience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Owen and Mr. Wichmann met as interns at the company in the summer of 1991, both researching laundry detergents. They cemented their relationship when they returned after graduating the next year. Though both started at P.&amp; G. as chemical engineers, Mr. Wichmann, who worked on Oxydol early on, later went into marketing while Mr. Owen joined the sales and finance side.</p>
        <p>They started business school together in 1994, attending Xavier University at night. For their final project, the pair designed the American Detergent Corporation, a hypothetical company that bought Oxydol from Procter &amp; Gamble -- a brand they said they chose somewhat randomly.</p>
        <p>Their professor, Sandy Eustis, was impressed by their enthusiasm but did not like their business plan. He voiced concerns that have since been echoed by Redox's critics.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Why would you want to go into a business that's dominated by huge players?' '' recalled Dr. Eustis, who is now executive director of the Center for Adaptive Management, a nonprofit research group in Cincinnati. ''It's a slow-growth, mature industry dominated by large players who spend huge sums of money on consumer marketing and advertising, and that presents real difficulties for a smaller, entrepreneurial company.''</p>
        <p>The men were not deterred. When the announcement of the Oxydol sale popped up on the office intranet in March, Mr. Wichmann knew he had to talk to Mr. Owen.</p>
        <p>P.&amp; G. had long neglected Oxydol; the detergent did not even have the company's fixture of a brand manager to babysit the product. Though P.&amp; G. did not see much of a future for the brand, the two men did.</p>
        <p>While he drove home the night of the announcement, Mr. Wichmann called Mr. Owen from his cell phone. All he needed to say was, ''Hey, Rich, American Detergent Corporation might be in business.''</p>
        <p>As they hatched their plans over the weekend, Mr. Wichmann said, they found themselves in a chicken-and-egg situation.</p>
        <p>They had to persuade P. &amp;G. to sell the brand to them instead of to an established company with deep pockets. ''We knew we needed to have a big angle for Procter &amp; Gamble to want to do this,'' Mr. Owen said. ''This thing had to be much bigger than just Oxydol.''</p>
        <p>To do that, they needed to assure P. &amp;G. that they had strong backers. But to get those backers, they had to convince venture capitalists that P.&amp; G. was intent on completing the sale. They also needed to keep their identity a secret so that if the deal did not go through, they would still have their jobs.</p>
        <p>''There really was this covert operation going on,'' Mr. Owen said. Mr. Wichmann decided they needed some outside help, so he called Dr. Eustis, who referred him to Robert Buechner, a childhood basketball buddy and Cincinnati lawyer.</p>
        <p>The lawyer was intrigued with their idea. He helped them write an anonymous bid and began introducing them to venture capitalists, bankers and accountants.</p>
        <p>During their lunch breaks and before and after work, Mr. Wichmann and Mr. Owen would meet with potential backers. They decided to wear khakis and shirts, the unofficial Procter &amp; Gamble uniform, to those meetings.</p>
        <p>''If you wear a suit at Procter and Gamble, that's a sign you're interviewing,'' Mr. Wichmann said. ''I didn't want to tip my hand.''</p>
        <p>After two months of sub rosa maneuvering they had to reveal that they were the anonymous bidders for Oxydol at P.&amp; G.'s demand. The men made a point of telling their respective bosses on the same day.</p>
        <p>''I actually had one of my bosses say, 'Rich, have you thought this through?'' Mr. Owen said. '' 'What happens if Procter &amp; Gamble considers you a competitor?' I thought, I've got my family and my resume.''</p>
        <p>P.&amp; G. was impressed by their plan. Company officials even spoke to venture capitalists on their behalf, the pair said, and a group of investors led by the Meriwether Capital Corporation in New York agreed to finance Redox. The deal for Oxydol was completed in a month, and both men were allowed to keep their jobs until it was done.</p>
        <p>Lately, Mr. Owen and Mr. Wichmann have been busy preparing Oxydol for the first Redox ship date this September. And in a recent conference call, they discovered some of the difficulties of being so closely tied to Procter &amp; Gamble. For every 600 boxes sold, the men want to give retailers 300 boxes free. P.&amp; G.'s system is not configured to handle free boxes, so they have to find another way to distribute them. They are also working on formulating a liquid detergent, and preparing a radio campaign.</p>
        <p>They are trying hard, meantime, to establish their own identity, separate from Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>
        <p>Their first trip back to P.&amp; G. went well. Former colleagues kept dropping by, curious how Mr. Owen and Mr. Wichmann were making out in what they call ''the real world.''</p>
        <p>While they were getting ready to leave their meeting, Mr. Owen noticed a small green packet of Oxydol on the shelf. ''You guys were supposed to turn over all of the product!'' he teased the P.&amp; G. representative. She and the partners shared a laugh.</p>
        <p>As he walked toward the elevator, Mr. Owen slipped the Oxydol packet into his back pocket.</p>
