        <p>With the Democratic National Convention just a few days off, Vice President Al Gore spent part of his beach vacation in North Carolina writing his own speech accepting the presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore told reporters on Thursday that he had spent several hours a day writing the address.</p>
        <p>''I've been drafted to tell him he should show it to other people sooner rather than later,'' said Martin Peretz, Mr. Gore's onetime Harvard professor and longtime friend. ''And I dread saying it because I dread his response.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Peretz, who is better known as the editor in chief of The New Republic, declined to say who had drafted him for the job, though he hinted it was Karenna Gore Schiff, Mr. Gore's oldest daughter and one of his closest advisers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schiff did not say whether she had asked Mr. Peretz to prod her father into involving the professionals, but said that her father was hard at work on the address that he will deliver at the convention, which begins Aug. 14.</p>
        <p>One night, Ms. Schiff said, the entire family was at the dinner table until nearly 10 p.m., nibbling on the remains of her dad's favorite Chinese dish, Szechwan beef, and ''listening to him talk through some of the paragraphs he had written.''</p>
        <p>After returning to New York, Ms. Schiff said, she spoke with her father on the phone on Thursday. ''He read me a few new paragraphs, which I thought were the best yet,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For a candidate to write a speech of this importance by himself is virtually unheard of in presidential politics. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, put his speechwriters through a number of drafts, but like most candidates did not do any writing himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, though, is a former newspaper reporter who by all accounts wrote every word of his 1992 book, ''Earth in the Balance.'' The eulogy he wrote for his father's funeral in 1998 was widely considered the best speech he ever gave.</p>
        <p>And it is hardly out of character for Mr. Gore, who has been known to totally rework the speeches written by his staff, to have taken on the speechwriting duties.</p>
        <p>He was heavily involved in the writing of his addresses to the 1992 and 1996 Democratic conventions. He also often does things on his own; this is the candidate, after all, who designed his own ''Gore 2000'' campaign logo.</p>
        <p>Because this speech is considered crucial for Mr. Gore's election effort, it is not surprising, either, that there might be concern about making sure the vice president hears from the professionals.</p>
        <p>But, even if the pros have not seen a draft of Mr. Gore's speech, he has at least talked to them about it. Last Saturday, Bob Shrum and Carter Eskew, his top consultants, met Mr. Gore in North Carolina to discuss the address.</p>
        <p>While on vacation, Ms. Schiff not only critiqued her father's efforts but also worked on the nominating speech she is to give. ''It feels like a really important toast at a wedding,'' she said, ''and I have to dig through my head for anecdotes.''</p>
