        <p>China Objects to U.S. Visa  China criticized the United States for giving Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, a visa to stop in Los Angeles on his way to the Caribbean, and it also expressed indignation at Taiwan's annual effort to join the United Nations. Still, Beijing's reaction in both cases was moderate compared with the diatribes that similar actions by Taiwan, considered a renegade province by China, have drawn in the past.</p>

        <p>Clinton to Visit Colombia  The White House said President Clinton would make a one-day trip to Colombia this month to lend support to that country's struggle against illegal narcotics and to spotlight the $1.3 billion aid package that Congress approved last month.</p>

        <p>Concern for Milosevic Plans  Clinton administration officials said the United States was increasingly worried that President Slobodan Milosevic would move militarily against Montenegro, the junior republic in Yugoslavia. The issue was discussed at a White House meeting this week and at NATO headquarters 10 days ago, officials said.</p>

        <p>Findings in Concorde Inquiry  Investigators of the Concorde crash said they had found a 16-inch strip of metal on the runway that did not belong to the plane, and that they had also found a large gash in a piece of tire debris. The statement suggested that investigators might be considering the possibility that a problem that had nothing to do with the plane's mechanics could have caused the crash last week.</p>

        <p>The Queen Mother Turns 100  Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by three generations of the royal family and waving to cheering well-wishers from the Buckingham Palace balcony where she marked the end of World War II and helped lead national rejoicing on other notable occasions.</p>

        <p>Gore Returns G.O.P. Fire, Citing Years of Prosperity  Vice President Al Gore, campaigning in Chicago, accused the Republicans of running a showy but insubstantial convention, and he strongly claimed credit for having helped create the nation's roaring economy.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is drafting his own acceptance speech for the Democratic National Convention this month, though supporters close to him want him to involve professional writers.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>Bush Seeks to Build Momentum  Gov. George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, campaigned by plane, train and automobile in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, swing states the Democrats carried in the last two presidential elections.</p>
        <p>A11</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush got a clear bump upward from his acceptance speech and the Republican convention generally, but its dimensions and duration were uncertain. One overnight poll, conducted for NBC News, indicated that Mr. Bush's lead over Vice President Al Gore had gone from 6 percentage points to 11, but some pollsters said attacks on Mr. Gore had played badly among independent voters.</p>
        <p>A11</p>
        <p>Protesters' Bail Challenged  Defense and civil liberties lawyers questioned whether high bail for protesters arrested in Philadelphia was a punitive measure intended to discourage the next round of civil disobedience, planned for the Democrats' convention in Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>Drive Aims at Black Voters  The N.A.A.C.P. is planning a $7 million campaign to mobilize and register black voters through television, radio and newspaper advertising, direct mailings, phone banks, pamphlets, faxes and other means.</p>

        <p>Inspections Cancel Flights  Alaska Airlines said it had canceled 48 flights in the past two days after grounding 17 of its 34 MD-80 aircraft for tail inspections. All 17 planes returned to service. The planes are the same model as the one that crashed off California in January, killing 88 people, when a part in the tail section malfunctioned.</p>

        <p>Sinatra Statue Plan Draws Fire in Times Square  City Hall is backing a proposal to erect a statue of Frank Sinatra in Times Square, where he caused a sensation performing at the Paramount in the 1940's, but opposition is quietly growing among the local community board, some area developers and theater moguls. A leading objection is that Sinatra is associated far more with Hollywood and Las Vegas than with Broadway.</p>

        <p>Arrest in Women's Slayings  Vincent Johnson, 31, a homeless panhandler, was arrested in the killings of six women in or near the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.</p>

        <p>Man Infected With Nile Virus  Health officials said a 78-year-old Staten Island man, whose name they withheld, had become the first person in the nation known to have contracted West Nile encephalitis this year. The state health commissioner declared the first statewide outbreak of the virus, citing birds found dead from the disease from the Atlantic almost to Lake Erie. Officials said the man was at home recovering and was probably infected before mosquito spraying began.</p>

        <p>No Bail for Bookkeeper  A judge refused to grant bail to Fidela Caparas, 54, a former head bookkeeper awaiting trial on charges of using phony paychecks to steal more than $10 million from her employer, Harris Publications, a publisher of magazines on hunting and weapons. Prosecutors say that while much of the money went to charity in the Philippines, Ms. Caparas was most generous to herself.</p>

        <p>For Parkgoer, Twice Bitten  The National Park Service sent notice of a $50 fine to a man hospitalized after he was bitten by a rattlesnake and had an allergic reaction to the antivenin. The man, Nathan A. Schomber, 26, picked up the snake at the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area although signs and officials warn people not to.</p>

        <p>A Sign Economy Is Slowing  American companies added 138,000 jobs in July, about half of what had been expected, lessening chances that the Fed will raise interest rates when it meets later this month.</p>

        <p>Effort to Avoid Phone Strike  Verizon Communications moved to avoid a strike tomorrow by more than 86,000 telephone workers from Maine to Virginia by submitting a proposal addressing some of its unions' main contract concerns. Verizon, the nation's largest wireless and local phone company, is the new name of the company formed when Bell Atlantic acquired GTE.</p>
        <p>C1</p>
        <p>Aetna Profits Decline  The largest health insurer in the nation reported a 17 percent drop in second-quarter profits, as more people sought increasingly costlier treatment. But the company said it was pressing on with changes intended to improve business by increasing prices for managed care coverage and giving regional managers greater authority.</p>

        <p>Shake-Up at Unilever  The global consumer goods giant, which has been on a buying spree, announced a reorganization of top management. The move would split the company into two divisions, one focused on food brands and the other on consumer products.</p>
