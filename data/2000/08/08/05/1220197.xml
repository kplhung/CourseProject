        <p>Maurice Vanegas is precisely the kind of person Gov. George W. Bush has been straining to speak to this past week. He is Latino and a small-business owner, he hews to the political center, and he is undecided about his vote this November. But after watching the Republican convention, Mr. Vanegas is also a skeptic.</p>
        <p>''I think Mr. Bush is very noble and he wants to do the right thing,'' said Mr. Vanegas, who is 31 and operates transportation and real estate businesses. ''But as far as making me want to vote for him, I'm still not there. As a Latino immigrant, being a bigger superpower isn't something that appeals to me, and I don't mind paying taxes or worry about a big tax cut. We just want opportunity and a country with a big heart.''</p>

        <p>Maurice Vanegas is precisely the kind of person Gov. George W. Bush has been straining to speak to this past week. He is Latino and a small-business owner, he hews to the political center, and he is undecided about his vote this November. But after watching the Republican convention, Mr. Vanegas is also a skeptic.</p>
        <p>''I think Mr. Bush is very noble and he wants to do the right thing,'' said Mr. Vanegas, who is 31 and operates transportation and real estate businesses. ''But as far as making me want to vote for him, I'm still not there. As a Latino immigrant, being a bigger superpower isn't something that appeals to me, and I don't mind paying taxes or worry about a big tax cut. We just want opportunity and a country with a big heart.''</p>
        <p>When Condoleezza Rice, a foreign policy expert, spoke on Tuesday night, Mr. Vanegas said, he found her engaging but peripheral. ''How much stronger do we need to be as a superpower?'' he asked. ''As a Latino and an immigrant, that isn't something appeals to me.''</p>
        <p>When Dick Cheney was introduced by his wife, Lynne, who mentioned his interest in fly fishing, Mr. Vanegas was turned off.</p>
        <p>''How many of us even thought about going fly fishing?'' he asked. ''I don't think many of us have the luxury of thinking about that. I'm interested in work.''</p>
        <p>Another immigrant, Mario Matute, 40, who is voting in his first presidential election, said he was impressed that Mr. Bush spoke some Spanish and was at least interested in wooing Latinos. Mr. Matute emigrated from El Salvador and runs a job development program.</p>
        <p>But after the convention appearances of two black speakers, Gen. Colin L. Powell on Tuesday and Ms. Rice on Wednesday, Mr. Matute said, he paid more attention to the color of the faces of the delegates.</p>
        <p>''Powell sounded mainly on the side of the Democrats by addressing education and the racism that still exists in the country,'' Mr. Matute said. ''They scored high with that. I think he spoke from the heart, but if you looked at the faces there, it didn't match. That was a disappointment for me.''</p>
        <p>At the end of the convention, which he described as generally impressive, he said: ''I want to believe that they are a new party and more inclusive, but it didn't look real to me, especially when it came to policies. I wanted to hear more about immigration policy and jobs, not tax cuts.''</p>
        <p>With its white majority long gone, a soaring immigrant population and a heavy reliance on small businesses, Los Angeles is the kind of nascent metropolis of the future that both parties need to capture to win the White House. Conversations with a handful of residents found that most of them, even ardent Democrats, had been impressed by Mr. Bush's sense of optimism. But there were also questions about how new the party could be with its conservative core intact -- a core that is still perceived by many people here to be less sympathetic than the Democrats to immigrants and the poor.</p>
        <p>Ann Inouye, a mortgage banker, said that she had been turned off by what she perceived to be a lack of moral rectitude in the Clinton White House and that she had found much to like in the Republican platform, even though she supports abortion rights. But in response to Mr. Cheney's sometimes harsh speech, she said that some of the attacks had been inappropriate.</p>
        <p>''Politics shouldn't be so polarized,'' Ms. Inouye said. ''Bush was confident and optimistic, not negative. That may be his edge.''</p>
        <p>The convention itself was a spectacle that left many cold. Some people who work in Hollywood, of course, saw it as a cynical act of manipulation, and they had their own suggestions for appealing to a broader audience.</p>
        <p>''I think they should lock everybody in the convention hall like 'Survivor,' '' said Robin Schiff, a television producer and screenwriter. ''The last person alive is the candidate. It's 'Republican Survivor.' Now that's a convention I would watch.''</p>
        <p>Jim O'Doherty, a television producer, is that rarity in Hollywood, an avowed Republican. His views evolved throughout the week. Early on, he expressed concerns about his party's chances. He said he had been very impressed by Senator John McCain's speech, but that it had only emphasized what he perceived as a lack of talent elsewhere in the party.</p>
        <p>''I'm very frustrated because we have some real problems with our image,'' he said. ''There's a charisma problem. We don't have the most exciting A-list talent pool.''</p>
        <p>By week's end, however, Mr. O'Doherty expressed enthusiasm for the convention as a successful show. He said he felt that Mr. Cheney's speech had energized the convention for the first time. He applauded Mr. Bush as a leader with good ideas in his speech, and he said the party had focused on the positive with a high moral tone.</p>
        <p>''He did exactly what his mission was,'' Mr. O'Doherty said of Mr. Bush's speech on Thursday night. ''He had to convince the swing voters to come over, and that's what he did.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Doherty's writing partner, David Israel, is a Democrat, but he found some common ground.</p>
        <p>''I think the biggest thing he had to do was to not appear smug, and he did that,'' Mr. Israel said. ''I think he's a likable guy, and he didn't say anything you could disagree with. But I still don't know what he's really going to do.''</p>
