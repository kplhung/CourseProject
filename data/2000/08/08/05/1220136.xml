        <p>Tamara Allen wanted to like what she saw. She was in the market for a president. She voted for Bill Clinton in two elections, and for Ronald Reagan before that. But she reacted to the Republican National Convention with disappointed venom.</p>
        <p>''I was astounded at the falsity, the facade of it all,'' said Ms. Allen, an executive assistant for Hands On Atlanta, a nonprofit service organization.</p>
        <p>Watching from her home in Grant Park, a predominantly black, gentrifying neighborhood of Atlanta, Ms. Allen, who is black, was heartened at first by the number of women and blacks and Hispanics on stage in Philadelphia. But then, she said, she went ''from being disappointed to being angry.''</p>
        <p>If the Republican Party hoped that assembling a festival of diversity on the convention podium would convince voters that its party had a grand new diverse face, conversations with voters in four places in America this week indicated that it was not entirely succeeding.</p>
        <p>Voters interviewed here and in New York, Milwaukee and Los Angeles had a wide array of reactions to the convention. Some found things to approve of, like the gathering's patriotic fervor or what they saw as Gov. George W. Bush's ''presidential stature.''</p>
        <p>But the one theme that ran consistently through many of their observations was that they did not necessarily accept at face value the rainbow image the Republicans were projecting.</p>
        <p>''It's like this mega-infomercial, but not nearly as entertaining,'' Ms. Allen said. ''Give me Ginzu knives.''</p>
        <p>Here, over four days of intermittent convention viewing in their homes, Ms. Allen and two other women undecided about their votes were less than sold on Mr. Bush and were waiting to see whether the Democrats in Los Angeles would be more captivating.</p>
        <p>One of the women, Latara Jackson, 19, who will vote for president this year for the first time, was at the end leaning, however slightly, in the Democrats' direction. An intern with the United States Department of Labor, Ms. Jackson is a student who describes herself as having conservative views. But after watching the convention's opening night, she found herself leaning away from the Republican ticket.</p>
        <p>''It was kind of a last attempt to basically come out as just very tolerant,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''It was like they were trying too hard.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jackson, an admirer of Gen. Colin L. Powell, was disappointed by his speech, which she found insincere.</p>
        <p>''It was like a last-ditch effort, and I was kind of disappointed that he would be a part of that,'' said Ms. Jackson, who, like General Powell, is black.  She also did not appreciate what she described as Mr. Bush's rude remarks about Vice President Al Gore's personality and character: ''He kind of made personal jabs at him. I think he did that to kind of get away from the issues.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's vow to prohibit the kind of late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion left Ms. Jackson feeling his stance had been watered down. ''In reality, we know he thinks all abortion is wrong,'' she said. (Mr. Bush has said he is not against abortion in cases of rape or incest or when a woman's life is in danger.)</p>
        <p>''I think the whole convention dealt with no issues at all,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''Any attempt to deal with any issues was very weak, just terrible.''</p>
        <p>While she believed Mr. Bush appeared presidential, if she had to vote tomorrow, Ms. Jackson would select Mr. Gore for what she saw as his sincerity and his drive to try to do what he thinks is best.</p>
        <p>''I would define myself more as a Republican than a Democrat,'' she said. ''But I just couldn't vote for this Republican,'' mostly because of the remarks he made against his opponent, but also because of the Philadelphia celebration's efforts to include minorities.</p>
        <p>''It was really late, like at the last minute,'' she said. ''It was a really bad attempt.''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Jane Kruzan, 72, a retired director of a volunteer placement agency, said she was beginning to think she could forget about some of the issues she felt strongly about, in order to vote Republican, as she often does.</p>
        <p>''The environment, gun control and campaign finance are certainly not being answered in these three days, but I'm impressed with the types of people promoting Governor Bush,'' Ms. Kruzan said.</p>
        <p>''I'm really looking forward to the debates,'' said Ms. Kruzan, who is white and lives in Decatur, an Atlanta suburb. ''I'm not ready for the ballot box. I would not feel comfortable going tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>She felt the same after hearing Mr. Bush's acceptance speech, which she found comprehensive and impressive.</p>
        <p>''I think he certainly articulated his views very well,'' she said, ''but I will have to admit that the truth is in the details.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kruzan said she was glad he mentioned the environment, though it was too low on his priority list for her, and she was not impressed by his plan to enforce existing gun-control laws rather than push for stronger ones.</p>
        <p>In all, she said, her opinion of the candidate rose during the convention, particularly after she saw people who might serve in a Bush cabinet.</p>
        <p>Late Tuesday night, Ms. Allen sat back from the television and played with her hair pensively. ''Today I'm just sad about my choices,'' she said. ''I'm concerned now. Yesterday I was still kind of waffling, but today I'm really sad. I don't know who I'm going to vote for, and I love voting.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday, when Mr. Bush vowed to support a ban on the abortion procedure, Ms. Allen, who is in her mid-30's, said he lost her vote.</p>
        <p>''There you go,'' she said. ''O.K., so, it's over for me. He just told me I don't control me. He just told me that I don't count.''</p>
        <p>''I guess I'll wait and I'll see what Gore has to say,'' Ms. Allen said Thursday. ''He better be honest. I mean just real stuff, not all of this kind of 'rockets' red glare,' lyrics from the anthem, fields of waving grass and grain.''</p>
        <p>She said the convention had pushed her away from voting for Ralph Nader, whom she admires.</p>
        <p>''I would have voted for Nader before I saw this, but seeing Cheney made me so afraid,'' she said. ''He doesn't represent half the people or a quarter; he represents the upper echelon.''</p>
        <p>''If I came out of this with anything, it's that I want a debate. Bad. I can taste it I want it so bad,'' she said.</p>
