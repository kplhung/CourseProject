        <p>Keyshawn Johnson must be cringing. Two games into the preseason, the Jets' starting offense seems unstoppable.</p>
        <p>Tonight it motored down Lambeau Field, scoring on each possession of the first half. The starting quarterback, Vinny Testaverde, spread his passes around -- to his favorite receiver, Wayne Chrebet, Curtis Martin, the rookie Laveranues Coles, Fred Baxter and Dedric Ward.</p>
        <p>Of course, if Johnson were here and not playing for the Tampa Bay Bucs, he could not have helped the Jets' defense. The offense gained 286 yards in the first half to help the Jets take a 7-point halftime lead, but the defense could not stop the Packers, who scored 17 points in the fourth quarter, and the Jets lost, 37-24.</p>
        <p>''I certainly expected the defense to play a lot better,'' said Coach Al Groh. ''There are a lot of guys that have to play a lot better when we come back here in three weeks.''</p>
        <p>The Jets will open the regular season here against the Packers on Sept. 3.</p>
        <p>Testaverde, who has still not been touched by a defender, is 10-of-18 passing for 234 yards in the first two games. He was 5 of 9 tonight and led the Jets on two drives -- one of 54 yards, the other of 85 yards -- which produced 10 points, a 33-yard field goal by John Hall and a 5-yard touchdown run by Martin. It's safe to put away the medical textbooks. Testaverde appears to be fully healed from his Achilles' injury.</p>
        <p>When the rookie Chad Pennington came in during the second quarter -- shook up the rotation with new players at several positions -- the Jets kept moving the ball. Pennington, who completed 7 of 11 passes for 136 yards tonight, has shown terrific poise in his first two games, even as he tries to figure out the scribble of plays written on his wristband.</p>
        <p>Against New Orleans last Saturday, he was 10 of 13 for 87 yards and tonight he led two second-quarter drives that ended in Richie Anderson touchdowns. The second drive, 10 plays for 84 yards and much of it done in the no-huddle, two-minute offense, was sprung by two passes, one of 15 yards to Coles and the other for 22 yards to Windrell Hayes. The only real blemishes were a fourth-quarter interception of Ray Lucas by Tod McBride, who returned the pickoff for a 41-yard touchdown, and two glaring drops by Coles.</p>
        <p>''I let Vinny's good work go down the drain,'' said Lucas, who was 7 of 14 for 51 yards and two interceptions. ''I let Chad's good work go down the drain. I singlehandedly lost this game.''</p>
        <p>If the offense has at least made blurry all the images of futility predicted for it with the departure of Johnson, the future of the defense did not appear so reassuring. Although Shaun Ellis and John Abraham -- the two top draft picks -- got significant time early in the game, the Jets still did not expect to get the sort of pass rush they had against New Orleans while facing the Packers' Brett Favre, the master of the quick drop and release.</p>
        <p>But how to explain the success of Favre's backup Matt Hasselbeck, who completed his first eight passes and shredded the Jets for 162 yards and two touchdowns on 11 of 15 passing?</p>
        <p>On his second touchdown pass, Hasselbeck stung cornerback Marcus Coleman, who was beaten by the backup receiver Charles Lee in the left corner of the end zone for a 31-yard touchdown.</p>
        <p>Abraham had a sack -- his second in two games -- but the Packers still gained 409 yards, including 196 yards rushing.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>ERIC OGBOGU, the starting right defensive end entering camp, was waived by the Jets on Friday. The procedural move means Ogbogu will be placed on the Jets' injured reserve list when he clears waivers. He will have surgery to repair a tear in his right shoulder Tuesday and is out for the season. Ogbogu, who was a sixth-round pick in 1998, missed 15 of the last 17 practices and also the first preseason game because of the injury, which does not involve the rotator cuff. He returned to practice last Monday and did nothing to endear himself to Coach AL GROH, who threw him out of practice after he got into a fight. Although it is unclear whether Ogbogu aggravated the injury in the scuffle, he was unable to practice after that. . . . Tight end ANTHONY BECHT, who got his first start after catching three passes against New Orleans, did not catch a pass Friday. . . . The experiment with the rookie WINDRELL HAYES at punt returner was short-lived, although Groh said he was committed to Hayes after he muffed a punt against New Orleans.</p>
