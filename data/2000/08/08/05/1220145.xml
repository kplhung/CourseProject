        <p>Alaska Airlines said today that it had canceled 48 flights in the past two days after grounding 17 of its 34 MD-80 aircraft for inspections.

        <p>Alaska Airlines said today that it had canceled 48 flights in the past two days after grounding 17 of its 34 MD-80 aircraft for inspections. Those planes are the same model as the one that crashed off the Southern California coast in January, killing 88 people, when a part in the tail section malfunctioned.</p>
        <p>Alaska said it acted after finding that a measurement tool made by the airline to monitor wear on the tail part had produced inconsistent readings, meaning that it might have failed to detect unacceptable wear in a control mechanism called a jackscrew. A factor in the January crash is believed to be problems with the plane's jackscrew, which had been checked with a tool made by the airline.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Alaska, Dave Marriott, said that as of late this afternoon, the airline had checked all 17 of the grounded planes with a measurement tool made by Boeing, the plane's manufacturer, and had found the tail parts to be within acceptable tolerances. The planes were returned to service by this evening, he said.</p>
        <p>Alaska had said on Thursday night that it was grounding 18 aircraft, but changed that to 17 after learning that one jet had been checked with a Boeing tool.</p>
        <p>The airline canceled 19 flights on Thursday night and 29 today, and rebooked passengers on other flights or other airlines. Alaska, based in Seattle, averages 500 flights a day and is a major carrier between the Pacific Northwest and cities in California.</p>
        <p>The airline has 92 aircraft, 34 of which are MD-80's. Another Alaska spokesman, Jack Evans, said half of the MD-80's had been recently inspected using tools made by Boeing, and were not grounded. The MD-80 maintenance manual says that motion in the jackscrew should be measured using a tool made by the aircraft manufacturer or an ''equivalent substitute.'' Alaska mechanics had inspected several of the other MD-80's using a tool made in the carrier's machine shop.</p>
        <p>''The airline found that the measurements could vary if the carrier's tool was improperly positioned,'' Alaska said today in a news release. The airline said it had notified the Federal Aviation Administration and had begun ''reinspecting the jackscrews on the affected aircraft using the tool made by the aircraft manufacturer.'' The airline suggested there was uncertainty as to whether its tool was considered an ''equivalent substitute.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman at the agency, Diane Spitalieri, said that checks had determined that other airlines were using a mix of tools, some built by the McDonnell Douglas division of Boeing, and others made by the airlines.</p>
        <p>Boeing assumed production of the MD-80, a more recent variant of the DC-9, after it took over McDonnell Douglas three years ago in a $16.3 billion merger. There are roughly 2,000 MD-80's and DC-9's in service globally.</p>
