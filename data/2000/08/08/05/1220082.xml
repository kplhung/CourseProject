        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Pupils Prosper From an Investment'' (news article, Aug. 2):</p>
        <p>Not to rain on Merrill Lynch's parade -- it ought to be lauded for making college a financially viable option for hundreds of students -- but isn't it a sad commentary on our society that it takes such extraordinary efforts to make college a reality for aspiring high school graduates?</p>
        <p>Economic barriers impede the paths of far too many qualified, motivated high school graduates. With an economy that increasingly demands a college degree for so many jobs, we cannot afford to limit college admission only to those from well-to-do families who can bear the costs of tuition or to the lucky few who receive generous scholarships.</p>
        <p>Whether through increased scholarship money, enhanced tax credits or other creative solutions, we must not cap the life opportunities of our young people, who so enthusiastically want, and so desperately need, a college education.</p>
        <p>ROBERT RUBIN  Legal Director, Lawyers'  Committee for Civil Rights  San Francisco, Aug. 3, 2000</p>
