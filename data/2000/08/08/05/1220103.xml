        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Putin, Exerting His Authority, Meets With Russia's Tycoons'' (news article, July 29), you report that the oligarchs had won President Vladimir V. Putin's ''assurance that their purchases of state property during the post-Soviet privatizations would not be overturned.''</p>
        <p>Does this mean that Mr. Putin will try to stop the work of the courts? In the last four years, the regional courts have tried 3,000 cases of illegal privatization, and decided in more than 1,000 of them that the property was illegally privatized.</p>

        <p>Mr. Putin cannot both uphold the rule of law and grant amnesty to those who took part in illegal privatization, which has contributed to the failure of thousands of companies and the poverty of millions of people. Such an act would shake the faith of his constituents and risk destabilizing the country.</p>
