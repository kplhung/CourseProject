        <p>With Senator John McCain at his side, Representative Rick A. Lazio pledged yesterday that he would pick up the senator's signature issue, campaign finance reform, and refuse the largely unregulated campaign contributions known as soft money -- if Hillary Rodham Clinton, his opponent, made the same pledge beforehand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, took particular issue with soft money used by independent groups to finance attack advertising against him, but found himself accused of hypocrisy by Democrats because similar groups have sponsored advertising for him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio called on Mrs. Clinton to abolish four accounts that he said had raised millions of dollars in soft money contributions. Such contributions have been criticized because it is often difficult to detect their sources and they effectively allow candidates to circumvent legal limits on contributions by individuals.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign, which laid claim to only two such accounts, immediately responded by noting that Mrs. Clinton had extended a similar pledge to Mr. Lazio months ago, but was rebuffed. She also accused Mr. Lazio of hypocrisy by complaining of soft money while deriving benefit from it through independent groups supporting his campaign.</p>
        <p>Soft money by law is not supposed to be used to advocate a candidacy directly; the funds are to be used for such things as party building and voter registration drives. But critics, notably Senator McCain, have criticized the limitations as so loosely interpreted that organizations do manage to influence campaigns and promote candidates. Congress recently passed legislation -- sponsored by Mr. McCain and backed by  Mr. Lazio -- requiring certain political organizations employing soft money to disclose their donors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said he was loath to refuse the help of soft money unilaterally because Mrs. Clinton and her supporters have raised much more of it than he could hope to. He said his campaign had not directly accepted any such contributions but would not refuse them, either, until Mrs. Clinton made the pledge.</p>
        <p>''I will not open any accounts of my own,'' Mr. Lazio said after touring a low-income housing complex in Hempstead with Mr. McCain, who championed campaign finance reform when he was running for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain, who joined Mr. Lazio at a hotel here for a fund-raiser for Joan Johnson, a Republican candidate for Mr. Lazio's congressional seat in Suffolk County, backed up the congressman's position. ''You can't expect him to unilaterally disarm,'' Mr. McCain said.</p>
        <p>Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, said only two of the four accounts Mr. Lazio named accept soft money in a joint fund-raising account the campaign maintains with independent organizations. Of the other two, one is an account under the control of the state Democratic Party and not the campaign, and the other is a campaign account that does not accept soft money contributions, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfson ridiculed Mr. Lazio for not disavowing independent groups that have benefited his campaign with advertising. ''Just because you don't have a joint account,'' Mr. Wolfson said, ''does not mean an organization is not spending on your behalf.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, sent a letter to Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, last night saying Mrs. Clinton had made similar pledges to refuse soft money, to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and to Mr. Lazio himself, but had been rebuffed.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately your campaign refused our offer, calling it a 'political gimmick,' '' Mr. de Blasio said. ''Since Congressman Lazio's refusal, so-called independent organizations have spent more than $652,000 on television advertising in support of your campaign.''</p>
        <p>''If you are now interested in discussing this, I would be eager to sit down with you,'' Mr. de Blasio said.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Blasio cited one such group, the Republican Leadership Council, which is running an advertisement featuring, against his wishes, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who called it ''soft money fakery.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has said he had no control over the advertisement because it was produced by an unrelated political group, but yesterday he said he saw no contradiction in calling on Mrs. Clinton to pull attack advertising sponsored by the state Democratic Party, using soft money. By law, neither candidate is supposed to have involvement in the spending of such money.</p>
        <p>The state Conservative Party has also run a soft money advertisement that features the congressman but does not specifically mention his candidacy. A campaign finance reform group at New York University has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission saying it in fact advocated Mr. Lazio's Senate candidacy.</p>
