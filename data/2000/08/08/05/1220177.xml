        <p>The idea formed within the imagination of the bench coach Don Zimmer. He and Manager Joe Torre and the hitting coach Chris Chambliss gathered outside Torre's office and discussed the framework of the Yankees' lineup last night, and determined Derek Jeter would lead off. They were not sure who would bat second.</p>
        <p>Zimmer suggested Jorge Posada -- something the catcher had not done since he was in Class AAA -- and they all nodded and smiled, figuring that the change might help Posada out of his slump.</p>
        <p>Zimmer possesses bragging rights now, for Posada had four hits and four runs batted in, inciting a couple of early rallies before driving in the go-ahead run in the seventh, as the Yankees went on to crush Seattle, 13-6.</p>
        <p>''The change helped, I think,'' Posada said.</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill had four hits, as well, and Bernie Williams slammed a three-run homer, leaving him one R.B.I. short of 100 for the season, and 31 shy of a switch-hitters' record shared by Mickey Mantle.</p>
        <p>If the playoffs were to begin today, the Yankees (59-45) and Seattle (62-46) would meet in the first round. Posada would probably not bat second. Chuck Knoblauch usually serves as the lead-off hitter and Jeter bats second, but Knoblauch's sore right elbow is not improving and Torre wants him to throw pain-free before Knoblauch is restored to the regular lineup.</p>
        <p>So Posada climbed high in the batting order -- so high, in fact, that when he first glanced at the batting order posted on the inside of the door to the Yankees' clubhouse, he didn't think he was playing at all. Posada couldn't find his name at the bottom half of the order and for an instant assumed he had been benched.</p>
        <p>Posada eventually discovered his name. Other than a 4-for-4 outburst against Baltimore on July 28, he had only two hits in his last 35 at-bats going into last night's game.</p>
        <p>Jeter and Posada stood in the on-deck circle together before the first inning. ''Get ready,'' Jeter told Posada, a reference to the fact that Jeter's at-bats often last one or two pitches.</p>
        <p>Seattle had scored three runs in the first inning against Andy Pettitte (12-6). Jeter flied out, and Posada walked to the plate, determined to be more aggressive, to look for pitches to drive. He was hitting in front of O'Neill, Williams and David Justice and assumed Jamie Moyer, the Seattle pitcher, would throw him strikes.</p>
        <p>''I just needed him to throw the ball where I was swinging,'' Posada said later, smiling.</p>
        <p>After Jeter flied out, Posada pulled a double to left field. O'Neill lined a single off the glove of third baseman Carlos Guillen, with Posada scampering to third when he saw the ball roll. Williams was next, and he posed a big-time problem for Moyer. Williams came into the game with 25 hits in 52 at-bats in his career against the left-hander, a .481 average.</p>
        <p>With a three-run lead, Moyer was obligated to throw strikes to Williams, and when the count reached three balls and two strikes, Williams drove one of those pitches into the left-field stands, tying the game. It was a huge hit for the Yankees, Torre noted later, an immediate response to Seattle's first inning.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had two on and two out in the second inning, and Posada dumped a single to score Tino Martinez; the Yankees led by a run, and then by two after O'Neill doubled.</p>
        <p>Posada's professional relationship with Pettitte is a work in progress, with occasional disagreements over pitch selection. They were at odds a couple of times during the fifth inning, and after the inning ended, Posada moved toward Pettitte in front of the dugout and raised both arms as if to question him. As Pettitte pulled on his jacket, he appeared to snap back at the catcher, jawing as he passed. Posada offered some response.</p>
        <p>Pettitte said afterward that the exchange had much less bite than it appeared. Pettitte said he was complaining how he could never get out Edgar Martinez, and when Posada tried pumping him up, Pettitte reacted.</p>
        <p>''He's the shoulder I cry on,'' said Pettitte, who was getting pats on the shoulder from Posada the very next inning.</p>
        <p>The Mariners tied the game at 5-5 in the top of the seventh. Clay Bellinger hit an easy roller to shortstop to open the bottom of the seventh, but Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez fumbled the ball.</p>
        <p>One out later, Posada smashed a line drive to left-center field, far out of the reach of Rickey Henderson, and Bellinger got a good jump and scored easily, moving the Yankees ahead, 6-5. The Yankees would add four more runs in the inning, the last on Glenallen Hill's two-run homer off the reliever Jose Mesa.</p>
        <p>The Yankees piled on in the eighth, scoring three more runs that they did not need.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch could be back in the lineup today, and Posada will probably fall back down to the lowest third of the batting order. But for one night, the brainchild of the bench coach was a success.</p>
