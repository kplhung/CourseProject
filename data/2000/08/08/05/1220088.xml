        <p>Stocks ended higher yesterday after the Labor Department reported that private job growth had been slower than expected last month.</p>
        <p>The data appears to make an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve later this month less likely. And the restrained job growth helps confirm the belief of some analysts that the central bank will not need any more rate increases later this year to slow economic growth to a noninflationary pace.</p>
        <p>''I said one more rate hike,'' Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig &amp; Company in Rye Brook, N.Y., said. ''These numbers make me look wrong.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, there is some concern about corporate earnings. Second-quarter earnings have been stronger than expected, increasing 21.2 percent so far, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. But a lot of companies have announced that they do not expect to meet earnings forecasts for the rest of the year.</p>
        <p>''We are still in a period of trying to rationalize very high earnings expectations,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. ''If you think that the economy is going to grow at 3.5 percent instead of 4.5 percent, you are too high. You've got to do something.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Federal Reserve policy makers have other important July economic data to review before they meet on Aug. 22, including retail sales and the Consumer Price Index. If retail sales are unexpectedly strong, which would signal a rebound in spending, rate-increase fears would presumably revive.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, stock prices moved up and down all day. Early on, the Nasdaq composite index was up 87 points, or 2.3 percent. But it reversed and at one time was down 8 points. The Nasdaq finished the day up 27.48 points, or 0.73 percent, at 3,787.36.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.17 points, or 0.57 percent, to 10,767.75. Early in the day, the Dow was off 41 points. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 10.37 points, or 0.71 percent, to 1,462.93. Market breadth was positive.</p>
        <p>The performance of Dow industrial stocks showed how the optimistic outlook for interest rates versus the concern about earnings, especially in technology, played out yesterday. The Dow was led higher by financial stocks including J. P. Morgan and American Express, which would be hurt by higher rates. Drags on the Dow included the technology giants Intel and Microsoft, as well as Eastman Kodak, which told investors in July that it was losing market share.</p>
        <p>Bond prices and yields also bounced around yesterday as investors tried to understand the import of the new jobs data. By late afternoon, the price of the 10-year Treasury note had climbed 13/32, to 104 12/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.89 percent from 5.95 percent on Thursday, the lowest since April. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.71 percent from 5.74 percent. Next week, the Treasury will sell $25 billion in new securities.</p>
        <p>The employment data showed that private-sector jobs rose by 138,000 in July, less than in June and less than the 182,000 average for the first six months of the year. Analysts said the 291,000 increase in the pool of available workers indicated there might be some slack developing in a very tight labor market.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barbera of Hoenig said that the most important matter facing investors is not whether there will be one more interest rate increase by the Fed. What is more important, he maintained, is that corporate earnings are probably going to slow more than even worried investors expect.</p>
        <p>The strong earnings growth in the first and second quarters, he argued, was the peak. He said investors were focusing more on the positive expectation that the Fed could guide the economy to a soft landing, avoiding recession, than the effect that a slowdown in growth would presumably have on corporate earnings.</p>
