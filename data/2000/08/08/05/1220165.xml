        <p>In search of fun and pots of gold, three jolly Englishmen have traveled to France, Germany, Dubai and Hong Kong, as well as Massachusetts, Kentucky and New York. They fly, of course, but it is a horse that leads them to these locales. His name is Running Stag, and he has logged more miles than many heads of state, hitting new soil with ground-burning speed.</p>
        <p>He has clocked more than 35,000 miles in the past year alone and, for the third time in that span, has made the journey from his base in Epsom in England to the United States, this time to take on the country's best older horses in the Whitney Handicap on Sunday.</p>

        <p>In search of fun and pots of gold, three jolly Englishmen have traveled to France, Germany, Dubai and Hong Kong, as well as Massachusetts, Kentucky and New York. They fly, of course, but it is a horse that leads them to these locales. His name is Running Stag, and he has logged more miles than many heads of state, hitting new soil with ground-burning speed.</p>
        <p>He has clocked more than 35,000 miles in the past year alone and, for the third time in that span, has made the journey from his base in Epsom in England to the United States, this time to take on the country's best older horses in the Whitney Handicap on Sunday.</p>
        <p>According to his owner, Richard Cohen, and his trainer, Philip Mitchell, their 6-year-old colt gets terribly bored galloping on the soft grass in his native land. In fact, in 19 races on turf, he has won only once.</p>
        <p>Reaching for a way for Running Stag to find the winner's circle as a 3-year-old, Mitchell put him in a maiden race on the dirt at Lingfield, England. He won by seven lengths.</p>
        <p>''He is the best dirt horse in Europe,'' Mitchell told Cohen, which was akin to the trainer declaring himself the best cricket player in New York -- turf racing dominates the Continent.</p>
        <p>Mitchell had a plan. Just as Running Stag took flight on the dirt, he and his horse were going to take to the air in search of what he called ''pots of gold,'' or richer races on his preferred surface.</p>
        <p>Cohen's reply was simple: Why not? ''I like having fun for starters and was game to see a bit of the world,'' said Cohen, 64, who is enjoying his first week of retirement from his international furniture, carpet and electrical company.</p>
        <p>So Mitchell sent Running Stag and an assistant trainer, Roger Teal, to Belmont Park for the 1998 Woodward Stakes. The invader finished a surprising third to the marquee horses of that day, Skip Away and Gentleman. By 1999, Running Stag had become a respected foe in the older-horse handicap division with a loss by a nose to Behrens -- one of his rivals Sunday -- in the Massachusetts Handicap.</p>
        <p>He followed that with victories in the Brooklyn at Belmont and the Grade II Saratoga Breeders' Cup here. Over all, he has earned more than $1.5 million in his career.</p>
        <p>The cost and mechanics of shipping Running Stag back and forth was a tiny investment, given the far bigger payoff of winning bigger purses. How do they ship and for how much?</p>
        <p>''We take the first six seats out of first class,'' said a deadpan Cohen.</p>
        <p>Not quite.</p>
        <p>For an $8,000 round-trip ticket, Teal walks Running Stag into a cargo plane, stands and holds him during takeoffs and landings, then sits in a chair nearby. ''He drinks and eats and naps just like any other international passenger,'' Teal said. ''It's really remarkable how calm he is.''</p>
        <p>There are other reasons for running in the United States. The races in America set up better for Running Stag's front-running style. In Europe, horses tend to lope during the early part of the race to preserve themselves for a late dash. And the constant pounding on dirt can take its toll.</p>
        <p>''In Europe, we have to do too much up front in races,'' Mitchell said. ''But to train over here all the time is too much.</p>
        <p>''We can gallop him through woods back home, work him on grass. American racing is hard on a horse.''</p>
        <p>In 38 races, Running Stag has demonstrated he is far from fragile. On his last trip to the United States, in May, he ran three races in two weeks -- winning an allowance race at Belmont and capturing the Grade II Massachusetts Handicap the next week before tiring in blistering June heat to finish sixth behind the Whitney's morning-line favorite, Lemon Drop Kid, in the Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Odds-makers have made Running Stag a 6-1 outsider in the $750,000 Grade I Whitney. Mitchell and Cohen hardly care. They were sent off at 25-1 last December when Running Stag finished second in the Hong Kong Cup.</p>
        <p>It was after that race, as well as a few pints, that Running Stag's rider, Shane Sellers, urged them to try the mile-and-one-eighth Whitney. ''He staggered up to me with a big glass in his hand and said the race set up for us,'' Mitchell said.</p>
        <p>So they're here trying to wring out the last of the big times in their equine odyssey. Cohen had to miss the last jaunt to the United States because he had because he was having angioplasty surgery. ''They told me it was important,'' he said with a wry smile. ''Both of us are getting old. Running Stag will go to stud soon and I'll sit back and watch his progeny run. At home, we all have wives and children who'd like to see us more.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>The sprinter Personal First upset the highly regarded Trippi to win the Grade 3 Amsterdam Stakes and give the trainer DAVID PAULUS his first victory with the first horse he ever saddled here. Under PAT DAY, Personal First dispatched Trippi at the top of the turn in the 6-furlong race, then ran down the front-running Disco Rico. . . . The starting times for the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes will be pushed back a half hour to 6:04 p.m. next year as NBC begins the first year in a five-year contract to cover the races. By moving the post times, the network hopes to attract a greater national television audience and keep the Triple Crown events from competing with its own coverage of the National Basketball Association playoffs.</p>
