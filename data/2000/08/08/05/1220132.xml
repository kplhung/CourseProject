        <p>On the face of it, Arab support for the Palestinian position has never been so unified. One after another, Arab kings and presidents have said they stand behind Yasir Arafat's claim to East Jerusalem and the right of return for Palestinian refugees.</p>
        <p>But behind the uncompromising public statements, more pragmatic approaches to those thorniest of issues are being discussed seriously among Arab leaders for the first time.</p>
        <p>There have even been signs of subtle shifts in the once monolithic Arab public opinion that Arab Muslims should have exclusive sovereignty over East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>In the 10 days since the Camp David talks broke down, on this and other previously taboo issues, Arab leaders have been absorbed in their most intense consultations ever on how to find a swift, workable deal that would combine both symbol and substance for both sides.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader, has shuttled around the region. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has received a string of Arab leaders at his summer palace in Alexandria, where Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel arrived on Thursday for talks.</p>
        <p>And Edward S. Walker Jr., a former American ambassador to Egypt and Israel and now an assistant secretary of state, has gone to Saudi Arabia as part of his tour of Arab nations that rely to some degree on United States money or military backing.</p>
        <p>A new Arab consensus on these issues could ultimately make an agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians possible, analysts and diplomats say, if Israel also compromises at least in symbolic ways on viewing Jerusalem as its eternal undivided capital and on Palestinian refugees as a resettlement problem for the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>''The Jews and Muslims are in a Catholic marriage with no possibility of divorce,'' said Kamel Abu Jaber, a former Jordanian foreign minister who led the first joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to the Madrid peace conference in 1991. ''Everyone realizes that the problem now is how to engineer arrangements to satisfy at least the minimum requirements of both sides to live together.''</p>
        <p>The concept of making ''arrangements'' along the way to peace is relatively new in the last 52 years of Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>
        <p>For seven years since direct talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians began in earnest, negotiations have focused almost exclusively on step-by-step details that have allowed most Arab leaders to remain on the sidelines, talking of a comprehensive peace settlement in absolute terms.</p>
        <p>But with the rush of expectation that came with the 15-day Camp David talks last month, Arab leaders are facing internal and external pressure to play a role in forging a final settlement. One reason is that both of the most contentious issues on the table -- Jerusalem and refugees -- carry implications for leaders other than Mr. Arafat and for peoples other than the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Jordan is home to more Palestinian refugees than any other Arab country. Egypt is a leading American ally in the region and is the only Arab state to have reached a peace agreement with Israel.</p>
        <p>And the approval of Saudi Arabia, as the keeper of Islam's two holiest sites, is essential to any shift, no matter how subtle, in the Arab position on Jerusalem, which contains the third-holiest site.</p>
        <p>''When Arafat is alone negotiating with the Israelis, he is too weak to make concessions,'' said Labib Kamhawi, a Palestinian-Jordanian political analyst. ''But if a third party is involved, the third party is like a facilitator. So I think, ultimately, an Arab umbrella will be given to Arafat.''</p>
        <p>Another reason is that most Arab nations, if not impatient for a settlement, have become at least used to the idea that a settlement would bring needed economic benefits.</p>
        <p>''There is a growing linkage in the region between having conditions of peace and the possibility of development,'' said Abdel Moneim Said, director of Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo. ''In addition, there is no one in the Arab world, except for some fundamentalists, who would deny any more the legitimacy of Israel. So we are all transferring from an existential conflict of 'us or them' to how we are going to be living with them.''</p>
        <p>Before the Camp David peace negotiations, reflections on how to finesse issues like Jerusalem were never seriously broached in Arab countries. But proposals for dividing administrative and religious control of the city, made at Camp David by Prime Minister Barak and President Clinton, have lifted a curtain.</p>
        <p>''There are ways of dealing with it without saying that Israel is sovereign over East Jerusalem,'' Dr. Said said. ''Certain things could happen de facto, if we have an agreement that settles the issue of East Jerusalem and left aside the question of the Old City.''</p>
        <p>Arab control over the Haram al Sharif, the man-made plateau in the Old City known to Jews as the Temple Mount that is the site of two of the holiest mosques in Islam, remains a fixed demand. It cannot be relinquished, Arab officials have said, without stirring the wrath of Muslim militants in the region and Muslims all over the world.</p>
        <p>But a number of Arab officials and commentators, even in the most religiously conservative country of Saudi Arabia, have recently talked of the need to cool tempers over Jerusalem and of making a distinction between political and religious sovereignty.</p>
        <p>''Jerusalem has a very important religious value, but its political importance is just as great,'' a Saudi official said. ''Maybe both sides could agree on joint administration according to certain arrangements.'' Postponing either Jerusalem or further negotiations is not an option, he added.</p>
        <p>''We have already wasted 52 years, and we do not need to waste more time,'' the official said. ''We have to take what we can now -- anything that is possible or is the remnant of the possible.''</p>
        <p>From another quarter, Fahmi Howeidi, an Egyptian commentator with close ties to the Islamic fundamentalist movement, also suggested that Arabs were focusing too much attention on the mosques. Instead, he wrote recently in the Cairo newspaper Al Ahram, they should emphasize the refugee issue.</p>
        <p>''The importance of the human being is more important than a place, even if this place is the Haram al Sharif,'' Mr. Howeidi wrote, adding that God would protect the Jerusalem mosques.</p>
        <p>On the issue of the return of refugees, a number of Arab officials have also said an arrangement is possible if Israel accepts the principle that Palestinians have a right to return if they fled or were forced from their homes in 1948.</p>
        <p>Until now, Israel has said only that it might accept some 100,000 refugees under a family reunification plan. About 3.2 million Palestinians are registered with the United Nations as refugees who fled or were forced from their homes at the time of Israel's creation in 1948 or are descendants of those who met that fate.</p>
        <p>Another 300,000 are considered displaced persons from the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in 1967. Some of the more flexible statements have come from Jordan, where officials and others of Palestinian descent say they doubt that many people will take advantage of a right to return, which would mean accepting Israeli citizenship.</p>
        <p>''Say you agree to theoretical language that refugees have the possibility of the right of return,'' said Marwan Dudin, a Jordanian senator who was born in Beersheba, in what is now Israel, and represented Jordan in multilateral talks with Israel about Palestinian refugees. ''It could take two to three generations to implement. But you at least make something that smells like an acknowledgment of the right of return.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Kamhawi, the Jordanian political analyst, agreed. ''At a minimum, Israel should uphold this right and then sit down and see if it's practical or not,'' he said. ''First the principle, then the details.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 8, 2000, Tuesday  Because of editing errors, an article on Saturday about an effort by Arab leaders to find a consensus on outstanding differences between the Palestinians and the Israelis misstated the Arab position on the issue of refugees. The Arab nations have long contended that Palestinian refugees are the responsibility of Israel, not of the rest of the world. The article also misstated the number of peace agreements signed by Israel with Arab countries. It is two -- not just with Egypt but also with Jordan.</p>
