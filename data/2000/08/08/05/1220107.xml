        <p>Nearly 18 million people watched the coverage of George W. Bush's acceptance speech on ABC, CBS and NBC on Thursday night, compared with the 17.8 million who watched the coverage of Bob Dole's on the major networks on the final night of the 1996 Republican convention, according to Nielsen Media Research data.</p>
        <p>Viewership was bolstered by a particularly strong showing by ABC, which ran an episode of ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' before its coverage began and scored the highest ratings of the night among the major broadcasters.</p>
        <p>On cable television, CNN, with 2.3 million viewrs, saw its final-night audience drop 22 percent from  the level of 1996. Some of those viewers clearly went to its new competitors. Fox News Channel, which was not in existence during the last convention, was watched by 1.7 million viewers. MSNBC, which was too small to be rated in the summer of 1996, was watched by 579,000 people.</p>
        <p>Despite the stronger showing on its last night, the  average television audience over the convention's four nights was down, compared with the audience in 1996, statisticians say. Nielsen experts said that it was difficult to compare the size of the audience for the two conventions because of the varying amounts of coverage and the new 24-hour cable channels. But, based on a rough analysis, they said they believed that the audience possibly dropped as much as 12 percent.</p>
