        <p>China criticized the United States today for giving Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, a visa to stop in Los Angeles next week on his way to the Caribbean and expressed indignation at the island's annual effort to join the United Nations.</p>
        <p>But Beijing's reaction in both cases was moderate compared with the diatribes that similar actions by Taiwan have drawn in the past. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province.</p>
        <p>The Chinese government urged the United States to reverse its decision to allow Mr. Chen the transit stop on Aug. 13, saying the ''comfortable treatment'' sends the wrong signal to pro-independence forces in Taiwan.</p>
        <p>''Even if these transit stops have happened many times before, it does not mean we like that,'' a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said. ''We are sure that this will be used by the Taiwan side to promote their agenda.''</p>
        <p>When former President Lee Teng-hui visited Cornell University in 1995, Beijing broke off semiofficial contacts with the United States and began conducting war games that culminated in firing missiles into the sea near Taiwan. Beijing's temper flared again when the United States granted Mr. Lee a transit visa in 1997.</p>
        <p>A State Department spokesman said granting Mr. Chen's stopover is part of a longstanding United States policy toward Taiwan's leaders. He said Mr. Chen would not meet any American officials, although he will meet Richard Bush, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, which handles unofficial United States ties with the island.</p>
        <p>Taiwan also angered China by making a fresh attempt to join the United Nations, saying 12 allies had submitted a proposal asking the United Nations to grant membership. Taiwan makes the attempt every year and is each year defeated.  Although this is the first such effort under Mr. Chen's administration, there is no reason to expect this bid to succeed.</p>
        <p>''The move constitutes a flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, a distortion of the nature of the U.N. and a gross interference in China's internal affairs,'' a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhu Bangzao, said in a statement carried by the state-run New China News Agency.</p>
