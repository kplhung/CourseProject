        <p>The Rangers got tougher yesterday, acquiring the physical right wing Sandy McCarthy from the Carolina Hurricanes for Rob DiMaio and Darren Langdon. The Rangers also received a fourth-round pick in 2001.</p>
        <p>McCarthy, 28, had 120 penalty minutes in 71 games last season for the Philadelphia Flyers and Hurricanes. The Flyers traded him to Carolina last March, and he re-signed with the Hurricanes as a restricted free agent last Tuesday.</p>

        <p>The Rangers got tougher yesterday, acquiring the physical right wing Sandy McCarthy from the Carolina Hurricanes for Rob DiMaio and Darren Langdon. The Rangers also received a fourth-round pick in 2001.</p>
        <p>McCarthy, 28, had 120 penalty minutes in 71 games last season for the Philadelphia Flyers and Hurricanes. The Flyers traded him to Carolina last March, and he re-signed with the Hurricanes as a restricted free agent last Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''Toughness starts with the entire team, not just one player,'' said Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, ''but I think McCarthy will help quite a bit in that area and that's why we acquired him.''</p>
        <p>McCarthy had six goals and five assists last season, all with the Flyers. He has 1,081 penalty minutes in 441 games in seven National Hockey League seasons for Calgary, Tampa Bay, Philadelphia and Carolina.</p>
        <p>DiMaio, 32, a 12-year N.H.L. veteran, split last season with the Rangers and the Boston Bruins, and had six goals and 19 assists in 62 games.</p>
        <p>Langdon, 29, who had spent his entire six-year career with the Rangers, played 21 games last season with an assist and 26 penalty minutes before an abdominal strain ended his season on Feb. 23.</p>
