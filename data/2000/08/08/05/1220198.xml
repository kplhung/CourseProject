        <p>Political science students at New York University recognize obscure de Toqueville quotations and argue the merits of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty vs. the Strategic Defense Initiative. So when the Republican National Convention rolled around, they were an astute audience, eager to analyze what George W. Bush set out to accomplish and how well he succeeded.</p>
        <p>The three doctoral candidates and four students from the undergraduate honors program differed on whether the convention was ''brilliant marketing,'' in the words of one, or ''insulting propaganda,'' in the words of another. But all agreed it was a textbook example of ''median voter theory'' and ''triangulation,'' jargon for capturing swing voters by adopting the popular issues of the opposition and burying the unpopular issues of its own fringe, as Bill Clinton's Democrats did in 1992.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, the theme of inclusion is a blatant plea to nontraditional Republican voters,'' said Ramsey J. Green, 20, as he watched a rainbow coalition of speakers cross the podium in Philadelphia. ''It seems as though they have finally realized that their reputation as white, wealthy and Christian will not appeal to socially liberal suburban voters and therefore prevent them from enjoying the policies of a Republican president.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Green, who said he would most likely cast his first presidential vote for Vice President Al Gore, veered between calling the tactic a ''sick Republican scheme'' and saying that the convention had ''gone extremely well'' for the party. He argued with himself about whether the Republicans were ''trying to pull the wool over my eyes'' or ''making a serious attempt to change the party's traditional ethnic and financial makeup.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Green said that the tone of the convention was a healthy development for the party and the nation.</p>
        <p>From the other side of the aisle, Costas Panagopolous, a doctoral student who ran unsuccessfully for the Massachusetts Legislature while a Harvard undergraduate, also saw the Republican show of inclusion as a plus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Panagopolous, 28, who ran as a Republican but has since re-registered as an independent, said, ''I do think it's a strategy -- for now. But if they win the election, they'll know it works, and this will have been a first step. It has to start somewhere. And there comes a point where perception becomes reality.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Panagopolous, with his experience as a candidate and a resume filled with jobs in marketing, seemed to unnerve other students with his unabashed admiration for the ''re-branding'' by the Republican party.</p>
        <p>''It's no different than re-positioning Hush Puppy shoes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sona Nadenicheck, a doctoral candidate devoted to academic research not the hurly-burly of politics, gasped, ''But that's not who they really are!''</p>
        <p>Ms. Nadenicheck's husband and fellow graduate student, Matt Golder, jumped in.</p>
        <p>''The goal is to get elected,'' Mr. Golder said, soothingly, comparing the Republicans to the Labor Party in his British homeland. ''It took the Labor Party 10 years to change their image.''</p>
        <p>The students, interviewed over the course of the four-day convention, were not equally engaged by the proceedings. Alissa Elliott, a 20-year-old with a bent for international relations, watched hours of C-Span each night, as she cooked dinner, ironed and answered e-mail and took detailed exception to the foreign policy positions of several speakers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Panagopolous, also a nightly devotee, dissected the ramifications of Mr. Bush's proposed tax cuts and lamented the candidate's silence on international trade and  domestic economic trends. Mr. Green seemed to have seen virtually every speaker, Republican National Committee video and mariachi or Motown band.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Martin Wolf, 19, skipped the first night because a broken fish tank had shorted out his television set, and he considered Mr. Bush's speech, which he grudgingly watched, a ''waste of my time.'' Ms. Nadenichek, 28, said she would have ignored the Bush speech and worked on a conference paper were it not for her husband.</p>
        <p>''Matt had the TV on and we have a small one-bedroom apartment,'' Ms. Nadenichek said. She said the convention was more interesting than it might have been because Mr. Golder brought a fresh eye to this American spectacle.</p>
        <p>All of the students noted, admiringly, the Republicans finesse at highlighting the improprieties, sexual and otherwise, of the Clinton White House and tarnishing Mr. Gore in the process. They also thought it deft to call attention to the nation's prosperity, the Democrat's crowning achievement in the past eight years, while characterizing it as an opportunity wasted.</p>
        <p>''Bush tried to point out what is morally wrong with the executive administration today while pointing out what is right with the economy,'' Mr. Green said. ''Theoretically, I guess this means all Bush has to do is win the election, move into the White House, do no harm to the economy and remain faithful to his wife. Sounds like a pretty easy job.''</p>
