        <p>The Writers Guild has announced that the writing credits on 14 films released from 1951 to 1964 will be corrected to include the names of several screenwriters blacklisted by Hollywood studios. The current credits on the films either omitted a blacklisted writer's name or used a pseudonym.</p>
        <p>In recent years the Writers Guild of America, West, has corrected the writing credits on 95 such films.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of writers as well as actors, directors, agents and producers found themselves blacklisted in the 1950's following efforts by the House Committee on Un-American Activities to find suspected Communists in the entertainment industry. Many of those on the blacklist refused to name names, declined to discuss their political beliefs, were singled out by informers or were simply liberals who were friendly with Communists. Many of the blacklisted writers started using ''fronts'' or pseudonyms, while others fled to Europe to find work. Careers were damaged, if not shattered.</p>
        <p>''The Hollywood blacklist destroyed the careers and lives of numerous Americans -- not only artists but also those in government, in academia and the unions,'' the Writers Guild said on Thursday. The Guild said that ''because of the unchecked zealousness of H.U.A.C, the list also managed to include non-Communist liberals and even victims of mistaken identity.''</p>
        <p>Among the films whose credits will be revised are ''He Ran All the Way,'' a 1951 drama. The corrected credit reads Dalton Trumbo and Hugh Butler, both blacklisted writers.</p>
        <p>Other blacklisted writers whose names have been added to films included Carl Foreman (''Born for Trouble,'' 1955), Ben Barzman (''Stranger on the Prowl,'' 1952, and ''It Happened in Paris,'' 1953), Cyril Endfield (''The Master Plan,'' 1954), Bernard Gordon (''Circus World,'' 1964) and Paul Jarrico (''The Man Who Watched  Trains Go By,'' 1952).</p>
        <p>Mr. Trumbo, a well-known screenwriter in the 1950's, whose films included ''Exodus'' and ''Spartacus,'' was given new credits on a handful of other the Writers Guild said.</p>
        <p>These included ''The Green-Eyed Blonde,'' 1958; ''Terror in a Texas Town,'' 1958; ''The Brave One,'' 1956, in which Mr. Trumbo shared credit with Harry S. Franklin and Merrill G. White; ''The Boss,'' 1956; ''Cowboy,'' 1958, sharing credit with Edmond H. North, and ''The Prowler,'' 1951. That film, also known as ''The High Cost of Living,'' is also credited to Hugo Butler.</p>
