        <p>Orlando Hernandez said yesterday that there are Yankees coaches who doubted the severity of his injuries when he was placed on the disabled list last month.</p>
        <p>''Some coaches mentioned behind people's back that maybe I wasn't as hurt as I thought,'' Hernandez said, without prompting, through an interpreter. Hernandez, who appeared to be near tears, added that it hurt him very much.</p>
        <p>''A lot of it is because they didn't come to my face and say it to me,'' he said. ''I don't play around with my work.''</p>
        <p>On the disabled list because of elbow and back trouble, Hernandez was asked whom he was referring to. ''Don't ask,'' he replied. ''I am a man.''</p>
        <p>Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, was surprised by Hernandez's comments. ''One of the things that we don't do, and I can speak for the staff, is that we never have doubts about when people are hurt,'' Stottlemyre said. ''We've always gone the extra mile to make sure people are O.K. There's nothing there.</p>
        <p>''I think that's something that's self-inflicted. I'm sorry he feels that way. It's his wrong thinking, not anything that we've done to lead to that. I'm very surprised. I'll probably address that.''</p>
        <p>Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, spoke with Hernandez just before last night's game against Seattle and said El Duque would not elaborate or offer more insight into his complaints. ''I kind of feel powerless to deal with it,'' Cashman said, ''because I don't know anything about it. Normally you deal with things straight up -- if you have a problem with someone, you speak to them directly about it.''</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, said: ''I'm not going to touch that. You guys can play with that like you want.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez is scheduled to be activated tomorrow to pitch against the Mariners.</p>
