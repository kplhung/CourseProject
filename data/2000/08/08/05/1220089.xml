        <p>Watching Greg, the Ivy League graduate, earnestly pretend a coconut is his cell phone in the middle of the jungle, or Richard, the scheming corporate consultant, strip naked in honor of his birthday; watching Mega, the black nationalist, sarcastically tell one-legged Eddie that he supports ''cripple rights,'' or Karen, the troubled housewife, confess her affair with her stepfather's nephew -- watching these ''real life'' moments from the television shows ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother'' (or the latter's 24-hour-a-day live Web site), I felt an all too familiar twinge.</p>
        <p>Plato described it as the contradictory feelings of repulsion and fascination that arise when a dead body is viewed by the living. Corpses must have caused an ancient form of rubbernecking. Now television does it. I watch in gruesome embarrassment.</p>
        <p>''Survivor,'' of course, stranded 11 people on a South Seas island, where they have to manage to survive the elements and one another; ''Big Brother''  stranded 10 people in a bourgeois house, where they have to survive one another and a very tiny refrigerator. Once they enter these worlds they abandon all hope of privacy; cameramen invisibly stalk the islanders; cameras noisily swerve throughout the house. And lest everything become too dull, much effort is expended to ensure discomfort and conflict. There are limited rations, unpleasant sleeping conditions, contests to teasingly create group loyalty and others to shatter it. Presumably the veneer of ordinary public manners will gradually fall away, revealing the private self in all its unsettling nakedness.</p>
        <p>The concept behind these shows is not unfamiliar. Take a group of types -- figures who, in their occupations or views, are recognizably representative personalities -- and throw them together in an isolating setting. Eugene O'Neill tossed his social emblems together in a bar for ''The Iceman Cometh.'' Katherine Anne Porter put them to sea for ''Ship of Fools.'' ''Gilligan's Island'' turned the gathering into slight farce, Sartre's ''No Exit'' into pretentious nightmare. All are meant to be microcosms of a society in which various public roles collide, revealing hypocrisy or crudity or sterility or venality. Names become irrelevant.</p>
        <p>The types are part of these shows as well. On the island: the single mother of two, the clueless doctor, the leather-skinned Navy Seal; in the house: the middle-aged dad, the exotic dancer, the eccentric virgin, the quiet beauty queen. And much of the drama is how, once pulled away from the society that defines those roles, figures like these manage to fend for themselves, supposedly becoming more ''real'' in their isolation, unveiling private truths.</p>
        <p>But what bizarre truths they are! The real is actually the world being left behind; the artificial is the world being created. Soap operas take ''fake'' people and put them in ''real'' situations; these shows take real people and put them in fake situations. Despite the trappings of primitivism -- the gongs, torches and rituals -- the participants in ''Survivor'' are at summer camp, a ''Lord of the Flies'' summer camp to be sure, but one complete with relay races and obstacle courses. The house of ''Big Brother'' is unlike any ever designed; the main lights never turn off; the hot water is rationed; there are weekly activities including mask-making, domino mazes and jump-rope contests. While creating supposedly Darwinian struggles, these settings actually infantilize their inhabitants: like children, if they are good, they get to play; if uncooperative, their elementary school friends cast them off into oblivion. And the hosts of these shows are two of the most smarmy and coy on television, adults who don't really know how to talk to children. Big Brother isn't frightening; he's creepily chummy.</p>
        <p>The climax of each show is the banishment of one of its citizens. But what qualities are being bred for success? ''Survivor'' boasts that many of its participants have wilderness skills; ''Big Brother'' has its share of more domestically oriented talents. But it isn't the most skillful who survive. Naked aggression is condemned, not rewarded. Mega, the first to be voted off ''Big Brother,'' seemed to relish creating conflict and demonstrating his superiority. Sense and maturity, as demonstrated by Gretchen on ''Survivor'' may have made her a threat and accelerated her banishment. I would wager that Rich, the most scheming of the Survivors, is doomed not to be one. Aggression must be hidden behind comradely socializing. ''I love her to death,'' says one islander after voting off a friend. ''This is no reflection on the type of person she is.'' Residents of the house often say they are voting off their house mates for their own good, because it would be better for them to head home.</p>
        <p>So it isn't the brutal truth that is shown, but something more like office politics with an exotic setting and bizarre comrades, complete with alliances and betrayals, friendships and rivalries and aggression cloaked by phony good feeling. ''Survivor'' even has a consulting psychologist, Dr. Gene Ondrusek, who provides the show's moral on CBS's Web site: ''Research overwhelmingly confirms that success in the workaday jungle depends more on your interpersonal skills and ability to get along with people than your technical competence.'' These shows don't break with their social surroundings; they incorporate them.</p>
        <p>In such a confusing universe, which at once resembles ordinary life while having nothing whatsoever to do with it, the moments of real emotion become all the more disturbing; it is as if someone's mask fell in the midst of a drama. Infantilism and adulthood, fakery and feeling, public and private swirl together in some eerie melange. The sensation recalls the queasiness caused by seeing tapes of President Clinton testifying about his sexual activities, or of Bill Gates squirmily claiming a poor memory in his testimony in the Microsoft antitrust trial. These public figures failed to contain their private selves; in the television shows, private figures eagerly court the public glance.</p>
        <p>It may be that at the heart of these shows is a cultural confusion about just what the private and public realms are. Culture is, to a great extent, about the relationship between the public and the private. But here, all coherence is gone. Public authority is fake ritual and the voice of Big Brother. Private feeling is pop psychology and confession. It's all very depressing. But riveting.</p>
