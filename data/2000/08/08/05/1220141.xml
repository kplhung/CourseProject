        <p>Who says the G.O.P. is against welfare? The show it put on here was nothing if not a bountiful assistance program, providing food, drink and shelter for 15,000 journalists who found themselves seriously underemployed at a political convention without fisticuffs. In keeping with Republican orthodoxy, the bill for this welfare program was picked up by the private sector -- the journalists' employers -- and not the taxpayer. What is compassionate conservatism if not life on an expense account?</p>
        <p>Alas, not all the recipients of this largess were grateful. Some journalists drifted into a kind of catatonia in which they said over and over to anyone who would listen how boring the G.O.P. infomercial was and how they longed for that happy time when Pat Buchanan would give a Nazi speech and all three major networks would leap to broadcast it. But not many were listening to this nostalgic reverie -- or anything else emanating from the city of brotherly inclusion. On Tuesday night, lowest-rated MSNBC had only 390,000 viewers -- a national audience slightly exceeding the population of Wichita.</p>

        <p>Who says the G.O.P. is against welfare? The show it put on here was nothing if not a bountiful assistance program, providing food, drink and shelter for 15,000 journalists who found themselves seriously underemployed at a political convention without fisticuffs.

        <p>Alas, not all the recipients of this largess were grateful. Some journalists drifted into a kind of catatonia in which they said over and over to anyone who would listen how boring the G.O.P. infomercial was and how they longed for that happy time when Pat Buchanan would give a Nazi speech and all three major networks would leap to broadcast it. But not many were listening to this nostalgic reverie -- or anything else emanating from the city of brotherly inclusion. On Tuesday night, lowest-rated MSNBC had only 390,000 viewers -- a national audience slightly exceeding the population of Wichita.</p>
        <p>As such grim reports from the outside world infiltrated the media bubble, there was much public and private soul-searching. Are the political parties killing democracy by staging canned pageants that TV networks don't want to broadcast and Americans don't want to watch? Or is the press itself the culprit? Should the underemployed masses of journalists at a convention be forced to work no matter what -- call it welfare reform -- and provide prime-time wall-to-wall coverage like the good old days, even if nothing is happening and no one is tuning in? Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News, found himself almost pilloried for cutting back his convention programming to a bare minimum, anticipating the day when the networks cover the presidential candidates' acceptance speeches and little else.</p>
        <p>I'm with Mr. Heyward. The political parties have the right to stage any kind of convention they choose to sell their candidate, and the networks have every right not to broadcast it in its entirety. As this Republican Convention illustrated more clearly than any other to date, political parties are in step with the rest of the branding-crazed American corporate culture. They roll out their homogenized products just as Gap introduces its new line of khakis or Hollywood its summer blockbusters. Elections -- the primaries and the general -- are still spontaneous and do demand full journalistic employment. But as long as conventions are tightly scripted exercises in friction-free salesmanship, they no more merit a full media army than an auto show. They are chapters in the history of American merchandising, not democracy.</p>
        <p>Even so, there were some real stories here that, for all the excessive size of the press contingent, did not always get the attention lavished on George P.'s looks, Gerald Ford's health, the rise of Internet journalism and the latest image makeover of Arianna Huffington.</p>
        <p>The true shadow convention in Philadelphia (as it will be at the Democratic Convention) was the one almost impossible for the media to penetrate -- the one put on by big money. ''Democracy is now lobbyists and fund-raisers,'' as a Republican operative put it to me. Instead of providing wall-to-wall coverage of the official doings in the First Union Center, some enterprising cable network or Web site might have more aptly set up a hidden 24/7 camera in the lobby of the new Ritz-Carlton Hotel, situated in what used to be the Girard-Mellon Bank buildings, if only to keep track of the fat cats hoping to buy influence.</p>
        <p>The efforts of ABC News's Brian Ross to infiltrate corporate festivities here -- which usually led to his and his cameraman's being body-blocked -- were more revealing than anything that happened on the convention floor. A front-page Times story by Don Van Natta and John Broder reporting that a mere 739 contributors are responsible for two-thirds of the $137 million in soft-money contributions to the G.O.P. gave new, if unsavory, meaning to the heretofore empty slogan ''prosperity with a purpose.''</p>
        <p>Another shadow convention -- or perhaps more correctly, closet convention -- began when Dick Cheney's perennially angry wife, Lynne, predictably became the only big-name Republican in the entire convention to go off-script. That moment occurred last Sunday morning when, in an interview on ABC, Cokie Roberts said to her, ''You have a daughter who has now declared that she is openly gay.'' Lynne Cheney snapped back, ''Mary has never declared such a thing,'' and then chastised Ms. Roberts for bringing the subject up. ''I simply am not going to talk about [my daughters'] personal lives,'' Mrs. Cheney barked, cowing Ms. Roberts into retreat.</p>
        <p>In tone and language, Mrs. Cheney thus conveyed that (a) her daughter is not openly gay; (b) to be gay is a frightful ''thing''; and (c) Ms. Roberts was revealing a Cheney family secret. In fact, Mary Cheney, who is 31, has by many media accounts been openly gay for close to a decade, lives with a partner, and until this spring worked as the corporate-relations representative from Coors Brewing Company to the gay and lesbian market, often appearing as Coors's spokeswoman for its gay philanthropy and promotional events. So it was preposterous to insinuate, as Lynne Cheney did, that Ms. Roberts had outed Mary Cheney. It was equally preposterous for Mrs. Cheney to claim that she would not be talking about her family in the campaign. She dragged her daughters into her speech introducing her husband to the convention just three days later, and throughout the week here wielded her heterosexual daughter's young child as a political prop.</p>
        <p>So what made Lynne Cheney lose it? The fact is that for all the minorities paraded across the convention stage, homosexuals are still at best seen and not heard in the G.O.P. At a reception for gay Republicans here, the honoree was Mary Matalin, an honorary lesbian, in the words of her jokey introducer, rather than, God forbid, an actual lesbian. The obligatory AIDS speaker at the convention itself was not gay, while the one openly gay speaker to appear, Congressman Jim Kolbe of Arizona, was permitted to talk about anything except being gay.</p>
        <p>Though George W. Bush was able to soften or remove the traditional hard-line G.O.P. platform boilerplate on almost every issue -- he even got rid of the plank calling for the abolition of the National Endowment for the Arts -- he let stand the party's draconian positions on both gay civil rights and abortion rights. Had he really wanted those stances altered, they certainly would have been.</p>
        <p>Which leads to the most important story here -- the political prowess of Mr. Bush. For all the ridicule lavished on this touchy-feely, pseudo-multicultural, neo-Clintonesque convention -- exactly the lockstep exercise in political correctness the right professes to abhor -- the medium really was the message. That message is not the official one, that the G.O.P. has overnight transformed itself into a haven for minorities. It hasn't. The real message is simply that Governor Bush had the iron-fist skills, the team and the imagination to persuade his party to convey that benign image, however synthetic some of it was. Everyone from pro-choice Republican women in pearls to Pat Robertson devotees to the most rabid Clinton-haters bit their tongues rather than frighten any of those few independents or Democrats watching. There were no mentions of impeachment; no ''it takes a village'' cracks about Hillary Clinton. Republican heavies from Richard Nixon to Newt Gingrich to Henry Hyde were erased from history with Stalinist efficiency.</p>
        <p>It was all so lulling -- except for Mr. Bush's ingeniously crafted acceptance speech -- that it looked easy. But it couldn't have been. The big news here, and it's far from boring, is that the G.O.P. nominee proved, as neither his father nor Bob Dole could, that he is capable of taming, uniting and, if you will, leading what has been for a decade a notoriously unruly and obstreperous party. Democrats are kidding themselves if they deny that Mr. Bush is far closer than he was a week ago to making the sale that he can govern the country as well.</p>
