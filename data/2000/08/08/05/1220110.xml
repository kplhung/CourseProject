        <p>When executives of Inside Broadway, a nonprofit arts education program, learned that the New York City Board of Education planned to turn some of the city's worst-performing schools over to private hands, they decided to take a chance.</p>
        <p>That was until yesterday, when school officials mapped out the requirements for prospective bidders. Applicants must have experience in running schools with more than 450 students and budgets of at least $1.5 million, among other things.</p>
        <p>Inside Broadway worked with 150 schools last year, producing shows, distributing Broadway tickets to schools and bringing actors into classrooms.</p>
        <p>''I don't think those are bad qualifications,'' said Paul Naish, executive business manager of Inside Broadway. ''But the newspaper ad didn't specify what experience we needed. I have never run a school. I've run arts programs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Naish was among about 100 vendors from across the city and the nation, including Fort Lauderdale, Fla., New Jersey, Boston and Providence, R.I., who crammed into a hearing room at the Board of Education headquarters in Brooklyn to learn of the requirements.</p>
        <p>But only a handful of vendors -- like Edison Schools, the largest commercial school management company in the country, and its competitors Victory Schools and Advantage Schools -- had the experience to qualify.</p>
        <p>Some of the smaller vendors complained about the requirement that bidders have experience in running schools with more than 450 students. But Judith A. Rizzo, the deputy chancellor for instruction, was unapologetic.</p>
        <p>''Here's what I'm looking for,'' Dr. Rizzo said. ''I want to know that you can run a school the size of a school in the Chancellor's District. I want to see if you can do the deal.'' The Chancellor's District is the special school district that the Board of Education established for struggling schools.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy issued a request for proposals to help the board convert the failing schools into charter schools in the fall of 2001. The move would release the schools from many of the state and local regulations that now govern them. If the schools' conversions to charter status are approved by the State Board of Regents, the schools' new managers will be able to renegotiate some union contracts.</p>
        <p>The plan does not specify how many or which schools would be turned over to private management. But officials said it was likely to focus on about 7 schools and could include as many as 20 in its first year, depending on the number and quality of applications.</p>
        <p>About 50 schools qualify for the program -- about 40 of which are elementary and middle schools and the rest high schools. They are on the state's list of ''schools under registration review'' because of their poor performance and are in the Chancellor's District.</p>
        <p>The requirements also call, among other things, for applicants to do a significant amount of community outreach, and for parents of 51 percent of the students in a school to vote for a charter conversion, in a process that would take months.</p>
        <p>The Board of Education would pay the management company on a per-student basis to operate a school. State law requires an allocation of only about $6,630 a student, not including money for federal benefits and other special programs.</p>
        <p>While Advantage Schools expressed concerns about the condition of the buildings, it planned to bid to operate some of the schools. It operates schools in Philadelphia, Washington, Newark and Phoenix.</p>
