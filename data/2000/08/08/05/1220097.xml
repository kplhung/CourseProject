        <p>Joel Conarroe Op-Ed article says cell phones are this millennium's addiction, just as cigarettes were the last's</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>While sitting in a coffee shop the other day, I had an epiphany.  Surrounded by men and women cuddling their cell phones, it struck me that these little metallic instruments are this millennium's cigarette.</p>
        <p>Just a few years ago my fellow coffee drinkers would have been smoking. Back then, too, Manhattanites would have strolled through the city holding cigarettes. Now they are clutching phones. Between courses, and at the end of a meal, folks used to light up. Now it is their little machines that light up. Before the cell phone, theatergoers rushed to the lobby during intermissions simply for a quick smoke. Now they hurry out to shout (the ''cell yell,'' it's called) into their indispensable gadgets.</p>

        <p>While sitting in a coffee shop the other day, I had an epiphany.  Surrounded by men and women cuddling their cell phones, it struck me that these little metallic instruments are this millennium's cigarette.</p>
        <p>Just a few years ago my fellow coffee drinkers would have been smoking. Back then, too, Manhattanites would have strolled through the city holding cigarettes. Now they are clutching phones. Between courses, and at the end of a meal, folks used to light up. Now it is their little machines that light up. Before the cell phone, theatergoers rushed to the lobby during intermissions simply for a quick smoke. Now they hurry out to shout (the ''cell yell,'' it's called) into their indispensable gadgets.</p>
        <p>What is it that makes these tiny devices so irresistible?</p>
        <p>It may be that, like cigarettes, cell phones provide something to do with one's hands. Needless to say, like nicotine, the machines are addictive. There is also the unfortunate matter of pollution -- loud talk -- less lethal than second-hand smoke, but a toxic irritant nonetheless. (''Hell,'' Sartre famously wrote, ''is other people.'')  And there are those periodic reports that the radiation the cell phones emit  may be hazardous to your physical health as well. Since, however, wireless companies offer hundreds of free minutes, there is abundant motivation to go ahead and chatter away, whatever the risks.</p>
        <p>It is possible, of course, that these ubiquitous toys are a passing fad, like leisure suits, the macarena and cigar bars. Remember when kids used to inflict their boom boxes on bystanders in public places? Eventually a code of etiquette (coupled with city ordinances) caught up with the technology, and it is rare now for anyone not in a car to ''share'' his or her music.</p>
        <p>Perhaps at some point soon it will be generally acknowledged that rehearsing one's thoughts over the phone, like flossing one's teeth or clipping one's nails (or, some would maintain, blowing smoke), is more appropriately attended to in private.</p>
        <p>Such a humane development, at least to these aggravated ears, would ring a gloriously welcome bell.</p>
