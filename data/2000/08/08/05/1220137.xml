        <p>The posturings and hypocrisies of the Republican Convention were pushed aside, in my mind, by the news that President Ford had suffered a small stroke. It made all the talk in Philadelphia seem even emptier.</p>
        <p>One of my greatest regrets as a newspaper columnist is how I underrated Gerald Ford when he was in the White House. It is time, past time, to say what a model of decency and respect for law he has been.</p>
        <p>''Our long national nightmare is over,'' he said when he took office after Richard Nixon's resignation on Aug. 9, 1974. ''Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men.''</p>
        <p>Those too young to have experienced Watergate may find it hard to understand how much those few simple words meant. Here was a president who trusted our system instead of conniving against it. And not just Mr. Ford's words but the plain sincerity of the man who uttered them. We needed someone we could believe.</p>
        <p>Belief was wounded when President Ford pardoned Mr. Nixon a month later. I was harshly critical of the pardon. So it is only right to say that I am less sure now. I believed  him in 1998 when he wrote, on The New York Times Op-Ed page: ''In the end I listened to only one voice, that of my conscience. I didn't issue the pardon for Nixon's sake, but for the country's.''</p>
        <p>Years ago, as a former president, Mr. Ford took part in one of those constitutional seminars that Fred Friendly put on, in which panelists played roles in prickly scenarios. The issue at one point was whether a president should take an action he deemed vital for national security even though Congress had forbidden it.</p>
        <p>The president's lawyer, on the panel, urged him to ignore the Congressional restriction. But Mr. Ford rejected the advice. A president, he said, has to follow the law, however inconvenient.</p>
        <p>When he entered the White House,  two of President Nixon's attorneys general had been sentenced for crimes. The Justice Department, crucial to the legal climate of the country, was in a terrible state.</p>
        <p>President Ford had to choose a new attorney general. He appointed Edward Levi, president of the University of Chicago, who was revered by lawyers across the country. When Mr. Levi died earlier this year, Mr. Ford spoke at his memorial service.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know his politics when I appointed him,'' Mr. Ford said. ''All I knew was that he shared my reverence for the Constitution. . . .</p>
        <p>''Thanks to Ed Levi, American citizens protesting the policies of their government no longer had to fear illegal surveillance, improper wiretaps or outright harassment. . . . In recommending John Paul Stevens for the Supreme Court, Ed . . . promoted one of the nation's most distinguished jurists. . . .''</p>
        <p>But of course Edward Levi could not have done what he did without a president secure enough in his own character to have such an independent-minded attorney general. How many presidents would appoint an attorney general without knowing his politics, and resolutely support him whatever the political cost? That takes real courage.</p>
        <p>Remembering what Gerald Ford did as president takes us back to Philadelphia. For the convention made clear, despite its papered-over unity, what a hard time George W. Bush would have dealing with his party if he was elected president -- how much he would need the courage and independence of Gerald Ford.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush speaks of wanting to carry on the fight against racism in this country. What would he do about the Republican senators who have refused to confirm a single black nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which has more black citizens than any other circuit?</p>
        <p>Is it the Republican Party of Gen. Colin Powell? Or is it the party of Senator Trent Lott and Representative Tom DeLay? When Republicans push through environmental ripper bills drafted by polluting companies, would George W. Bush have the courage to veto them as President Clinton did?</p>
        <p>Most important, would Mr. Bush be ready to do what he has not done as governor of Texas -- think seriously about the American legal tradition and what it demands? Would he follow Gerald Ford in putting politics second to respect for law?</p>
