        <p>When the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association planned a conference here this week for evangelists from around the world, it signed up a raft of prominent speakers, many of them very well known among evangelical Protestants.</p>
        <p>But not everyone who took the podium came from the sort of religious background that Mr. Graham represents, the itinerant evangelist of Baptist background. In fact, one of the more interesting and nuanced speeches came from the leader of a hierarchical and liturgical church -- the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, spiritual leader of the Church of England and first among equals among bishops of Anglican churches worldwide, a group that includes the Episcopal Church in the United States.</p>
        <p>He came to talk about effective Christian preaching in a ''broken'' and sinful world. And he began by praising some words of the French existentialist Albert Camus -- not the sort of figure one would expect to hear quoted at an evangelists' conference. Yet, the archbishop said, Camus, in his book ''The Fall,'' which is set in Amsterdam, had given a moving appraisal of human sinfulness. He called the book a great one.</p>
        <p>The archbishop urged that churches preach a ''committed faith in Christ'' as the singular Savior, an argument for the uniqueness of Christianity's claims in a world increasingly conscious of religious pluralism. But he also said -- twice, in fact -- that he held no brief for fundamentalism.</p>
        <p>''The Christ whom we follow is one who allows people to think, argue, dispute and doubt,'' Archbishop Carey said. ''Authentic Christian faith is not afraid of scholarship or the critical study of the Scriptures.''</p>
        <p>He also called on evangelicals to embrace an ecumenical spirit in the name of presenting a common faith, and to be involved in society to combat social evils. In supporting ecumenism, he was endorsing both the example set by Mr. Graham, who has long tried to bring together as many different churches as he can at his preaching events, and also the various Anglican churches, which have lately entered into formal alliances with other denominations, as Episcopalians have with Evangelical Lutherans in the United States.</p>
        <p>Archbishop Carey's speech to the conference, which concludes on Sunday, was reported and favorably commented upon in the British press. But much of the focus was on a limited part of it, in particular, his criticism of human attempts to replace religious faith with total reliance on therapy, education or the pursuit of wealth. He had good things to say about therapy and education, but indicated that he worried that too many sermons had adopted a therapeutic message and missed ''an appeal to a holy God and his call to us to turn to him in repentance and faith.''</p>
        <p>What some reports on his speech overlooked, too, was the note of optimism he struck, unlike those who would preach doom and gloom. The archbishop called the world a good place, even wonderful. ''No true Christian ever despises the world,'' he said. ''We love it, we exalt it, we cherish it. And we love humanity made in God's image. Fallen, yes -- but always loved by Almighty God and therefore loved by us.''</p>
        <p>Before the conference began, its organizers predicted it would be attended by 10,000 evangelists from 190 nations and territories. The estimates turned out to be very close to right. After the event began, Mr. Graham's association reported that 10,287 people, representing 209 nations and territories, had registered for it.</p>
        <p>Half those attending came from either North America or Africa. After the United States, with 2,767 people, the largest delegations came from India (495 people), Ghana (249), Kenya (204) and South Africa (182).</p>
        <p>Many brought pamphlets with them, to spread the word about their particular efforts. Thus, one information table carried stacks of fliers describing groups probably little heard outside their immediate regions: India Youth for Christ, the Evangelical Alliance of Sri Lanka, Christ Total Gospel Ministries International, of Nigeria, and many, many others.</p>
        <p>Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's eldest son and designated successor as head of the Graham organization, was also among the conference's speakers, taking the podium Thursday after flying from Philadelphia, where he had offered a prayer at the Republican National Convention.</p>
        <p>His stated theme was evangelism and compassion, but he seemed more inclined to offer his audience a lesson about preaching to win converts. Make sure, he told the crowd, that people know in advance that you are going to make an altar call, so the unconverted know they will have the opportunity to come down to the front of the event and declare a born-again faith in Jesus.</p>
        <p>Like Archbishop Carey, Mr. Graham spoke about sin, but from the perspective of one who wants to tell people just what it is. ''People today, especially in Western society, don't even know what sin is,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To clear up the ignorance, he said, he often goes to the Ten Commandments. ''Telling a lie is a sin, sex outside of marriage is a sin,'' Mr. Graham said. ''But I'm very careful to say God loves you.''</p>
