        <p>Stocks ended higher after the Department of Labor reported that private job growth had been slower than expected last month. The data appears to make an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve later this month less likely. [Page C3.]</p>
        <p>Aetna Reports 17% Drop in Profits  Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer, reported a 17 percent decrease in second-quarter profits as more people sought increasingly costlier treatment. But it said it was moving along on sweeping changes aimed at improving business. [C2.]</p>
        <p>8 Wall St. Firms Settle Charges  Banc One Capital Markets and seven other securities dealers have agreed to pay a total of $13.5 million to settle the latest federal case accusing firms of overcharging municipalities for Treasury securities in a practice known as yield burning. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Unilever to Split Into 2 Divisions  Unilever, the global consumer goods giant that has been on a buying spree in the United States, announced a major reorganization of top management. The move would reorganize the company into two divisions, one focused on food brands like Lipton Tea and Ragu spaghetti sauce and the other on consumer products like Dove soap and Elizabeth Arden cosmetics. The news revived speculation that the company planned a full split in two. [C2.]</p>

Grasso, on a popular Internet message board. In the suit, lodged in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the exchange contends that the John Does, using aliases like RichAGrasso, impersonated Mr. Grasso on the Ragingbull.com Web site.

        <p>Role Seems to Remain for Concorde  The July 25 crash of the Air France supersonic Concorde brought down a plane that by common measurements can hardly be profitable, given its high maintenance costs, daunting fuel bills, little passenger space and no cargo. Yet any decision to ground the Concorde permanently could have deep financial implications for Air France and British Airways, the two airlines that run it. Its loss would divert high-end corporate travelers to other airlines, notably in the United States, or to corporate jet travel. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Alcoa in Deal to Expand in Europe  Alcoa said it had bought Baco Consumer Products of London for an undisclosed price to increase its sale of household plastic wrap and aluminum foil in Europe. The company is Britain's biggest seller of aluminum foil and plastic bags. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Rio Tinto Wins Battle for North  Anglo American ended its bid to acquire North, the Australian mining company that is one of the world's biggest producers of iron ore. A rival, Rio Tinto, countered Anglo American's $1.8 billion bid with one that was 11 percent higher. [C2.]</p>
        <p>G.E. to Get Air Force Contract  Lockheed Martin said it had selected General Electric to provide engines for an updated version of its Galaxy transport aircraft for the Air Force, a contract that could be valued at up to $2.6 billion. [C4.]</p>
