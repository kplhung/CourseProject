        <p>Verizon Communications, the nation's largest wireless and local phone company, moved yesterday to avoid a strike by more than 86,000 telephone workers from Maine to Virginia by submitting a proposal addressing some of its unions' main contract concerns.</p>
        <p>Still, the possibility of a walkout may have increased after Verizon skirted other important issues like union organizing attempts among its wireless work force, the contracting out of some labor, and the loss or migration of jobs as a result of mergers in the last several years.</p>
        <p>Unless the company and the unions agree on issues by 12:01 a.m. Sunday or extend discussions, leaders of 72,000 members of the Communications Workers of America and 14,700 members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers have promised a walkout at Verizon, the new name of the company formed when Bell Atlantic acquired GTE.</p>
        <p>Efforts to win assurances from Verizon that would make it easier to organize employees in the wireless businesses into unions are at the heart of the dispute. Unlike their counterparts in traditional areas of the telecommunications industry, wireless workers are generally not union members.</p>
        <p>Only a few dozen of the 32,000 employees in Verizon's wireless division are unionized, compared with nearly 80 percent of the 120,000 employees in the local phone operations. Labor leaders are concerned that the wireless division is growing much faster than the rest of the company.</p>
        <p>If the unions do strike, the telephone network would probably not be disrupted, the company says. But about 25 million businesses and households in the East could be inconvenienced by delays in requests to repair or install phone service, make operator-assisted calls and have questions answered about phone bills.</p>
        <p>Emergency services like 911 would not be disrupted in the event of a walkout, according to Verizon officials. The company also said it would give priority to communications for hospitals and other health care operations. It said it did not yet know if it would create hot lines or special telephone numbers for customers inconvenienced by any work stoppage.</p>
        <p>Seeking to prevent a strike, Verizon made its proposal yesterday morning addressing wages, pensions and job security. Representatives from the two unions and Verizon discussed the proposal at length in Washington.</p>
        <p>Under the proposal, Verizon would increase wages by 3 to 4 percent a year for union employees, improve pension plans for active workers and offer some job security, according to Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon. The details about job security, though, were not clear last night.</p>
        <p>In addition, the company plans to offer increased funds for day care programs, improved medical benefits for new employees and an adoption reimbursement.</p>
        <p>But, according to the communications workers union, the proposal did not address concerns about forced overtime, the movement of work locations as a result of the merger, or the contracting out of some services to nonunion companies in areas including the installation of high-speed Internet lines.</p>
        <p>''Because the company would rather farm out work,'' said Ed McGowan, a Verizon employee who installs digital service lines in Midtown Manhattan, ''this means one company installs the line on the outside of the building, which is us, and another on the inside, which is them. This results in a big headache for the customer, who has to be at home for two days instead of one, and a loss of income to a nonunion company.''</p>
        <p>Neither side appeared optimistic about the chances of reaching an agreement before the strike deadline early Sunday, people close to the talks said. The involvement of senior company and union officials in negotiations, which could change their direction, is expected only on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>The results of the talks between the unions and Verizon are likely to have repercussions throughout the wireless communications industry. Verizon Wireless, which Verizon owns in an alliance with Vodafone AirTouch of Britain, is the nation's largest wireless company, with 26 million subscribers.</p>
        <p>Although the wireless industry is generally not organized into unions, some companies, like SBC Communications and BellSouth, which together operate the nation's second-largest wireless carrier, make organizing efforts easier by allowing employees to join a union if a majority at a given site agree to do so.</p>
        <p>''If unions can tap into a key area like wireless,'' said Stanley Aronowitz, a sociology professor at the City University of New York, ''it means much more than simple wage increases or better pensions. This is about questioning who benefits from wealth creation in the new economy.''</p>
        <p>Based on figures before the company became Verizon this spring, Bell Atlantic's wireless division outstripped its traditional land-line operations in generating revenue, according to the communications workers union.</p>
        <p>For example, each wireless employee generates $325,000 a year in revenue, or 230 percent more than counterparts in regular telephone operations. And the company's wireless operations generate $532 a year in revenue from each customer, compared with $324 a year for each telephone company customer.</p>
        <p>A Verizon spokesman said the company was wary of discussing the organization of its wireless work force into a union because Verizon Wireless operates as a separate company from Verizon Communications.</p>
