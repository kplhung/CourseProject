        <p>Ira Berkow Sport of The Times column discusses swimmer Adolph Kiefer who, as member of 1936 United States swimming team, recalls meeting Adolph Hitler; Kiefer says Olympics movement has lost its way, that there should be return to purer form of amateurism and to sports for sake of fitness, not just money; photo (M)</p>

        <p>THERE had been a commotion, Adolph Kiefer remembers, and everyone stopped what he was doing and looked around.

        <p>Kiefer, then 17, was already a record-holding backstroke champion and a cover boy on many magazines. At 6 feet 1 inch, 175 pounds, he was strong and, with dark hair and blue eyes, handsome enough to have later been asked to audition to play Tarzan in a movie. But now Kiefer climbed out of the Olympic pool, soaking wet, and shook hands with Hitler.</p>

        <p>THERE had been a commotion, Adolph Kiefer remembers, and everyone stopped what he was doing and looked around. There were German soldiers and an entourage surrounding Adolf Hitler entering the training-pool area in the Olympic village in Berlin. This was shortly before the start of the Games in 1936. Kiefer recalls Hitler taking a seat at poolside and watching some of the training session, and then the German Fuhrer asked to meet him and two other swimmers.</p>
        <p>Kiefer, then 17, was already a record-holding backstroke champion and a cover boy on many magazines. At 6 feet 1 inch, 175 pounds, he was strong and, with dark hair and blue eyes, handsome enough to have later been asked to audition to play Tarzan in a movie. But now Kiefer climbed out of the Olympic pool, soaking wet, and shook hands with Hitler.</p>
        <p>''I remember him being a small man with a small hand,'' Kiefer said, ''and his handshake wasn't a firm one. Then he spoke to the interpreter, and I was told he said something like, 'This young man is the perfect example of the true Aryan.' ''</p>
        <p>Kiefer wasn't sure, at that time, what Hitler was referring to. After all, he was an American -- born and raised in Chicago. Yes, his parents, Otto and Emma, had immigrated to the United States from Germany some 20 years earlier, but there were no other ties to their homeland, or its new theories. ''At the time, I was honored to meet this important head of state,'' Kiefer said. ''But if I knew then what I know now about Hitler, I should have thrown him into the pool and drowned him. I even can't stand the name Adolph now. But I'm stuck with it.''</p>
        <p>Kiefer continued to make a name for himself. He won the gold medal in the 100-meter backstroke in the Berlin Games, setting the Olympic record of 1 minute 5.9 seconds, though he didn't break his own world record of 1:04.8. The Olympic record stood for 20 years and the world record for 25. In his career, racing the backstroke from 50 feet to 1,500 meters, Kiefer lost just two races in 2,000 meets from 1935 to 1944, setting 17 world records. Last January, he was voted one of the 25 greatest male swimmers of the 20th century by a panel for Swimming World Magazine.</p>
        <p>He joined the Navy in World War II. When he learned that more sailors died from drowning -- because they couldn't swim -- than from enemy fire, he was allowed to implement new safety guidelines and a training program to teach seamen how to stay alive in the water.</p>
        <p>Kiefer now sits about 40 miles north of Chicago in a crowded, unpretentious office in the expansive setting of Adolph Kiefer &amp; Associates, an aquatic supply company that he founded in 1947 and which bears the motto: ''We supply everything but the water.''</p>
        <p>He is 82 years old, bespectacled, broad-chested, the father of 4 and the grandfather of 14. Though he still swims every day in the pool in his home, he uses a walker since a nerve affliction several years ago left his feet with no feeling. He remains committed to the Olympic ideal, he said, though he laments the ''politics, the profiteering, the professionalism'' that much of it has turned into.</p>
        <p>''I thought things began to change from amateurism to something else in Berlin, which was called the first 'big' Olympics,'' he said. ''It was Hitler trying to show through sports that his nation could create a superior athlete, a superior being. And from this tried to show the world how mighty his nation was. It was appalling. Then the Russians and East Europeans followed to take the Olympics to another level of professionalism. And it became a race to see which country wins the most medals, which ones break the most records.''</p>
        <p>Commenting on a 90's development, he added: ''I didn't even like those Dream Team basketball players we had. They lived separately from the Olympic Village, rode around with chauffeurs. The Olympics should be athletes from different countries getting to know each other.''</p>
        <p>Kiefer has often attended the Summer Olympic Games. But it's getting harder for him to get around, and he won't be in Sydney, Australia, for the 2000 Games. ''I still enjoy the athletic performances,'' he said, ''but I think the Olympics movement has lost its way. There has to be a way to return to a purer form of amateurism, to sports for the sake of promoting fitness and health -- not just money.''</p>
        <p>In retrospect, is it not odd that so rich a life was built on swimming upside down and without looking where you're going? ''Not really,'' Kiefer said. ''It began when I was a kid. I didn't like to get water up my nose.''</p>
