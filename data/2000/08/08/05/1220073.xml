        <p>Growing up in Uganda, Moses Isegawa was an insatiable reader, savoring books by writers as diverse as Philip Roth, V. S. Naipaul, Timothy Mo and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. From the age of 14, he dreamed about becoming a novelist himself. ''I thought it must be magical to be a writer,'' he said recently. ''To tell a story and somebody deep in a village in Uganda reads it and can identify with the place and the characters -- I never lost that idea of the magic and the excitement of literature.''</p>

        <p>Growing up in Uganda, Moses Isegawa was an insatiable reader, savoring books by writers as diverse as Philip Roth, V. S. Naipaul, Timothy Mo and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. From the age of 14, he dreamed about becoming a novelist himself. ''I thought it must be magical to be a writer,'' he said recently. ''To tell a story and somebody deep in a village in Uganda reads it and can identify with the place and the characters -- I never lost that idea of the magic and the excitement of literature.''</p>
        <p>It took many years, but at 37 Mr. Isegawa is a novelist, with an increasing international reputation. His first novel, ''Abyssinian Chronicles,'' was recently published by Alfred A. Knopf, having already been published in the Netherlands (where the author now lives) and in Finland and Germany.</p>
        <p>The book is both a coming of age novel with a cast of evocative African characters and an account of the political turbulence under Idi Amin, the former Ugandan dictator. During his first visit to New York, Mr. Isegawa said the book was 90 percent fiction and 10 percent memoir. But throughout, it resonates with the knowledge of first-hand experience.</p>
        <p>''The skeleton'' of the novel, he said, came from his life: his move from the country to the city of Kampala, his years studying in a Roman Catholic seminary and his eventual departure for the Netherlands. He fleshed out the book by cross-pollinating characters, ''working up'' incidents and imagining dramatic events. At the heart is an Isegawa-like protagonist named Mugezi.</p>
        <p>From the first sentence of the novel, it is clear that this fictional world is not so distant from magic realism: Mugezi's father is consumed by a ''colossal crocodile.'' Then the book moves into a flashback. Mr. Isegawa's father and mother live in Uganda, and they have not yet read their son's book, he said. They may be surprised by the unflattering portraits of Mugezi's parents, especially of the mother, who is emotionally and physically abusive of her son. If his parents are upset, Mr. Isegawa said, so be it: ''I think Philip Roth said, if a family gets a writer in its midst, there's going to be trouble -- and it's going to be on my address, on my doorstep.''</p>
        <p>Mugezi has his own strong streak of malice, often pitting his parents against each other. This is not a portrait of a hero as a young man. Instead, in the author's words, Mugezi is closer to a villain. ''I tried to get away from the love-me kind of book,'' he said. ''I wanted to treat everybody the same way. I was not going to be soft on myself and then go out and start punching people below the belt. I wanted to write a challenging book, challenging to myself and to other people.''</p>
        <p>He stressed the fictive elements in his protagonist. ''If I had written a book about myself,'' he said, ''it would have been the most boring book ever written.'' In contrast to the aggressive Mugezi, Mr. Isegawa seems soft-spoken and genteel. Mugezi may be a case of wish fulfillment: ''He became my cowboy, my outer ego, who is not afraid to get in trouble: to hit and also get hit.''</p>
        <p>In contrast with the family story, the portrait of Idi Amin is drawn directly from life. When Amin leads a coup d'etat in 1971 to overthrow the corrupt Obote administration, Mugezi -- in common with other Ugandans -- greets him as a savior. At first, Mr. Isegawa said, ''he did everything people wanted him to,'' and announced political and social reform.</p>
        <p>''It was only afterward that reports started coming in that people had been kidnapped and killed,'' he continued. In one of several harrowing scenes in the book, soldiers rape one of Mugezi's aunts. In the end, Mr. Isegawa said,Amin also ''destroyed the physical structure of the economy'' and culture, as publishers left the country and books disappeared from bookstores.</p>
        <p>At the time, Mr. Isegawa knew little about Amin. Politics was a taboo subject at home. In his family, his grandfather, a lawyer, was the most communicative, and it was from him that he gathered family stories.</p>
        <p>While at the seminary, Mr. Isegawa began writing short stories. He sent some to a pen pal friend in the Netherlands who passed them on to a Dutch missionary magazine, which published them, and then asked Mr. Isegawa to write a monthly column.</p>
        <p>Emboldened by this encouragement, he decided at 26 to leave Uganda. ''It was like stealing away,'' he said. He told only a few people, and simply got on a plane and flew to the Netherlands. An aunt and a cousin saw him off at the airport: ''They didn't even know that I was going to be a writer. They thought I was going to do what other young people do'' -- leave the country to make money and send it back home.</p>
        <p>He had something entirely different in mind. ''I had burned all my bridges,'' he said. ''I think writers need a shock. In Amsterdam, I had to begin at zero level. I had to learn the language, and find my own feet. When people would ask what are you doing, I would say I was a bookkeeper.'' In fact, that was one of his occupations. In secret he became a book writer.</p>
        <p>Over the years his book grew larger and more personal, and by the time he was 30 he was more confident about his talent. When he finished the novel, he made four copies and sent them at random to four Dutch publishers. Two immediately returned the manuscript, but the third publisher accepted it and commissioned a Dutch translation of the English. The author was jubilant, and the subsequent rejection of the fourth copy did not discourage him.</p>
        <p>In 1997, eight months before the book was published, he was interviewed on Dutch radio, and that set off a series of other interviews. By the time the book came out, he was already a celebrity in the Netherlands. Favorable reviews sparked sales. Acting as intermediary, his Dutch editor helped findpublishers in other countries.</p>
        <p>Explaining the curious title, Mr. Isegawa said he wanted to find a word that would encapsulate the desperate situation in Uganda, and hit upon ''abyss,'' then expanded it to ''Abyssinia.'' As the father says in the book, ''Uganda was a land of false bottoms where under every abyss there was another one waiting to ensnare people.'' For him, it was Uganda, not Ethiopia, that was really Abyssinia.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Isegawa could call himself a writer, a feeling that was underscored during his visit to the United States. In New York he shared an evening's reading with the critic Stanley Crouch, who told him he had been at a birthday party for Saul Bellow and had recommended that Mr. Bellow, Mr. Roth and William Kennedy read ''Abyssinian Chronicles.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Isegawa heard that, he said he thought: ''Wow! Incredible stuff. I can't imagine those writers taking the time to read my book. I would be honored to be in their company, but, for me, I'm still the wannabe. I have one book. I'm just saying this is the way I want to go.''</p>
        <p>In the book, the name Mugezi is defined as meaning brilliant in Ugandan. Asked what Moses means, he said, ''taken out,'' which seems relevant: he was taken out of Uganda. But as Mugezi says, ''I carried the village with me and it would remain so the rest of my life.''</p>
        <p>''I'm still part of it,'' Mr. Isegawa said of Uganda. ''When you leave, you leave with all the images. I planted that tiny village in the book and now it has grown to this big thing in the world. You leave a situation but you can't leave it psychologically.''</p>
        <p>This summer the British edition will go on sale in Uganda. His parents will have a chance to read it, and the author will return home, for the first time. And in some small outlying village, other young men may read the book and be inspired by the magic of Mr. Isegawa's story.</p>
