        <p>Two men were seriously injured and three others were slashed by a knife-wielding attacker in a crowded Queens nightclub described by the police as a trouble spot, the authorities said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The police arrested Nick Gambino, 19, of 2155 71st Street, Brooklyn, in connection with the attack. The charges against him include attempted murder and assault.</p>
        <p>The stabbings occurred about 2 a.m. yesterday at the Metropolis nightclub in the College Point section of Queens, the police said. Investigators said that Mr. Gambino, armed with a folding knife with a five-inch blade, attacked the men after a dispute, possibly over a woman. The police said that they had recovered the knife from the roof of the club, and that Mr. Gambino had apparently thrown it there to dispose of the evidence.</p>
        <p>Two victims, James Mastronardi, 19, and Anthony Federici, 18, were in critical condition yesterday at New York Hospital in Queens. Mr. Mastronardi had been stabbed in the neck and Mr. Federici in the stomach, the police said. The other three victims were treated and released.</p>
        <p>Police officials said that Metropolis, at 31-99 123rd Street, had been the scene of a variety of crimes and  disorderly conduct incidents in the last several years.</p>
        <p>Last August, a gunman opened fire on a van in the club's parking lot, killing a 29-year-old man and wounding three other people, two of them critically.</p>
        <p>Police officials said that hours before the recent violence erupted, the police had been at the club doing inspections as part of their continuing surveillance there.</p>
        <p>No summonses were issued as a result of that inspection, but the police said they had issued 15 summonses to the club since February for a range of violations, including underage drinking and locked exits.</p>
        <p>The club ownership has changed  this year. The new owner, Michael Diaz, will not be penalized for violations that occurred under the previous ownership, an official said.</p>
