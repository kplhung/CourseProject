        <p>Slobodan Milosevic is running for another term as Yugoslavia's president in an unfair election that he will most likely win by any means necessary. Nevertheless, the opposition should run against him. No one believes that Mr. Milosevic will leave office simply because voters tell him to. But if the opposition can unite on a single presidential candidate for the elections, in late September, it can at least revitalize its popular support and shake some of the apathy that is paralyzing Serbia.</p>
        <p>The opposition will certainly run candidates in local elections. Anti-Milosevic candidates won in more than 30 municipalities in 1996, although protesters had to occupy the streets for months in order to get Mr. Milosevic to recognize the victories.  These local officials give the opposition control of some funds and broadcast media, in addition to political stature and a base for organizing. The posts are crucial to keep. The opposition should also run candidates in the federal Parliament to reduce Mr. Milosevic's near-total control.</p>

        <p>Slobodan Milosevic is running for another term as Yugoslavia's president in an unfair election that he will most likely win by any means necessary. Nevertheless, the opposition should run against him. No one believes that Mr. Milosevic will leave office simply because voters tell him to. But if the opposition can unite on a single presidential candidate for the elections, in late September, it can at least revitalize its popular support and shake some of the apathy that is paralyzing Serbia.</p>
        <p>The opposition will certainly run candidates in local elections. Anti-Milosevic candidates won in more than 30 municipalities in 1996, although protesters had to occupy the streets for months in order to get Mr. Milosevic to recognize the victories.  These local officials give the opposition control of some funds and broadcast media, in addition to political stature and a base for organizing. The posts are crucial to keep. The opposition should also run candidates in the federal Parliament to reduce Mr. Milosevic's near-total control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic has taken no chances with his own re-election. Recently he has shut down many of the remaining independent media in Serbia, and has been intimidating opposition politicians and independent activists through violence and abuse of the courts. His ubiquitous propaganda allows him to remain the most popular politician in Serbia. But he is helped by a petty and ineffectual opposition. Polls, however, show that if the opposition united around a single candidate, that person could win. Even if there is little chance the winner would be allowed to take office, this would energize the opposition.</p>
        <p>This weekend there is a convention of the Serbian Renewal Movement, whose leader, Vuk Draskovic, is the main obstacle to a united opposition. Mr. Draskovic has in the past cut deals with Mr. Milosevic and sabotaged opposition unity, acts that should disqualify him as a candidate this time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic has said that his party will not participate in the elections if Milo Djukanovic, the president of Serbia's tiny sister republic of Montenegro, stays out as well. But Mr. Djukanovic, who has led his republic in a mutiny against the Yugoslav president, has a better reason for boycotting. He is already under the constant threat of attack from the Yugoslav army stationed in Montenegro -- an attack that Washington fears may come soon. The presidential election will be staged with new rules that are part of a recent constitutional coup by Mr. Milosevic, which greatly reduced Montenegro's influence in the presidential election and over all.</p>
        <p>If the opposition does contest the election and Mr. Milosevic wins, countries such as Russia, Greece and Italy should not use his ''victory'' as a pretext to improve their relations with Serbia. They well know he keeps power through repression. Nor should Mr. Milosevic look forward to a change in American policy if Gov. George W. Bush becomes president. The Republican platform says there should be no negotiations with indicted war criminals such as Mr. Milosevic, and that Washington should seek their arrest, trial and imprisonment.</p>
        <p>Contesting Mr. Milosevic for the presidency requires opposition unity. Democratic opposition parties were able to beat Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia and Franjo Tudjman's party in Croatia only when they overcame their internal squabbles. Mr. Milosevic is more malignant, but that only makes unity even more necessary.</p>
