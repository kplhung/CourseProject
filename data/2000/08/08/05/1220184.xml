        <p>BrandDirect Marketing Inc., a large telemarketing company here that operates numerous discount shopping clubs, has agreed to pay $1.9 million to the states of Connecticut and Washington and to credit customers with $11 million in club membership fees, settling a federal lawsuit over allegations that it violated consumer protection laws, the state attorney general said today.</p>
        <p>The attorneys general's offices in Washington and Connecticut began investigating BrandDirect in April 1999 after consumers in Washington complained that their credit cards had been billed for club memberships that they did not think they had ordered, since they never provided their credit card information to the company.</p>

        <p>BrandDirect Marketing Inc., a large telemarketing company here that operates numerous discount shopping clubs, has agreed to pay $1.9 million to the states of Connecticut and Washington and to credit customers with $11 million in club membership fees, settling a federal lawsuit over allegations that it violated consumer protection laws, the state attorney general said today.</p>
        <p>The attorneys general's offices in Washington and Connecticut began investigating BrandDirect in April 1999 after consumers in Washington complained that their credit cards had been billed for club memberships that they did not think they had ordered, since they never provided their credit card information to the company.</p>
        <p>But BrandDirect had already legally obtained from credit card issuers the information needed to process the charges.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for BrandDirect, Tom Drohan, denied any wrongdoing but declined to specifically discuss the company's sales tactics.</p>
        <p>Under the settlement, BrandDirect must tell potential customers that the company has their credit card information and that it is being used and give all 2.7 million members of its various clubs three weeks of free membership, worth about $11 million, the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said today.</p>
