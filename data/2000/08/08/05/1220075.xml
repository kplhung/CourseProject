        <p>Farce, as Moliere knew, is a very serious business, and anyone attempting to ''adapt'' the French master with modern gimmickry will find a lot of bumps along the way. Keith Reddin, who has reworked ''The Imaginary Invalid'' into an extended skit called ''The Perpetual Patient,'' hits just about every pothole.</p>
        <p>Anything resembling nuance of character, so important to Moliere, who believed real comedy depended on language and acting rather than on props, is jettisoned in favor of shtick.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reddin, a playwright whose credits include ''Rum and Coke,'' ''Nebraska,'' ''Life During Wartime'' and ''The Innocents' Crusade,'' has moved the play to the United States in the early 1900's. It is a venue with possibilities, and an opening tableau in which eight cast members rush onstage pitching patent cures for a catalog of unpleasant ailments is promising.</p>
        <p>But the promise fades quickly. Argan, the hypochondriac of the title, goes over his medical bills like an H.M.O. accountant (''$2 for an enema? I'll only pay $1.29''), and the cast begins to expound the plot: Argan wants to marry his daughter to a doctor so he can have 24-hour health care, but she is in love with another. Then Mr. Reddin begins to interject bits of adaptation. These include a maid who spouts Marx and is trying to organize the domestic help into a union and more impromptu commercials for miracle cures. (After two or three, one begins to wonder if Mr. Reddin also writes pharmaceutical advertisements for late-night television.)</p>
        <p>A lot of ''The Perpetual Patient'' relies on tired and familiar sight gags, vaudeville routines, sophomoric references to bodily functions and old-fashioned mugging to get an odd chuckle. For example, at one point the maid starts hauling chairs into Argan's sitting room a la Ionesco; Argan is given an ''and don't call me Shirley'' line from ''Airplane!''; there's a ''walk this way'' routine; and the following chestnut is actually presented twice:</p>
        <p>DOCTOR: Have you been eating red meat?</p>
        <p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>
        <p>DOCTOR: Was it tender?</p>
        <p>PATIENT: Yes.</p>
        <p>DOCTOR: Who's your butcher?</p>
        <p>Moliere, meet Henny Youngman.</p>
        <p>Under the direction of Billy Hopkins, once with the Ensemble Studio Theater and now a Hollywood casting director, the actors can't seem to decide whether to go purely for the clowning or to make an occasional stab at real farce. There are a couple of scenes in which there is a glimmer of a comedy lurking among all the silly business. But it's never more than a flicker, and ''The Perpetual Patient'' ends up more as a spoof of Moliere than an adaptation.</p>
        <p>David Thornton's Argan seems genuinely more interested in his bowels than in his daughter's happiness. Leslie Lyles gets the most out of Bridget the Red maid, while Matthew Newton has a good turn as Cleatis, the beloved of Argan's daughter, and Ean Sheehy is credible as Bernard, Argan's brother. Anna Thomson, as Argan's wife, at least brings some energy to an often listless production, and Linda Halaska has a moment of fun playing Dr. Flea as an S-and-M dominatrix.</p>
        <p>THE PERPETUAL PATIENT  By Keith Reddin, an adaptation of Moliere's ''Imaginary Invalid''; directed by Billy Hopkins; set by Jason Kirschner; lighting by Matthew Staniec; costumes by Sarah Edwards; original songs by Jeffrey Lunden and Art Perlman. Presented by Cold Productions, Pat Blake and David Elliott; New York Performance Works, Andrew McTiernan; All Season Theater Group, John McCormack and Karen Hauser.
