        <p>Investigators looking into last week's crash of an Air France Concorde said today that they had found a 16-inch strip of metal on the runway that did not belong to the plane, and that they have also found a large gash in a piece of tire debris.</p>
        <p>The investigators have so far been unable to explain why the jet caught fire on takeoff and crashed into a small wooden hotel just north of Paris, killing 114.</p>
        <p>Without any theories, French transportation officials have continued to keep Air France's remaining Concordes out of service.</p>
        <p>But a statement released today by the B.E.A, the French agency that investigates air crashes, suggested that investigators might be considering the possibility that a problem that had nothing to do with the plane's mechanics could have caused the crash.</p>
        <p>Since the disaster on July 25, speculation has largely focused on the possibility that a tire suffered a blowout and debris from it or a wheel sliced through fuel lines or fuel tanks, triggering a fire. But investigators have yet to offer their opinion.</p>
        <p>The metal strip could explain how the tire was damaged. But in their statement, the investigators continued to steer clear of explanations. They offered a smattering of new facts without explaining how any of them might fit together. They have said that a preliminary report will not be ready before the end of the month and a final report could take 18 months to complete.</p>
        <p>The investigators said that one of the plane's left-side tires was changed before takeoff and survived the crash intact. Debris from another tire on the left side was found on the runway.</p>
        <p>Tire marks on the runway also showed that the plane had veered to the left before taking off. Traces of soot, pieces of water deflectors above the tire and debris from a fuel tank were also on the runway.</p>
        <p>In 1993, a water deflector on a British Airways Concorde broke off and punctured a fuel tank. The British airline later modified the deflector so this would not happen again. But Air France officials have said that they did not install the same modifications.</p>
        <p>Today, some Air France employees sent an open letter to the airline to organize a special Concorde test flight to show that they still had confidence in the plane.</p>
        <p>''There is no reason to keep it on the ground,'' said Gilles Belliard, spokesman for the National Union of Civil Aviation Mechanics. Mr. Belliard said that mechanics and other employees would volunteer to board the special flight.</p>
        <p>But Air France officials said no such flight would take place before the Transportation Ministry ruled that the French Concordes could fly again.</p>
        <p>British Airways briefly suspended its Concorde flights, but went back to regular service the day after the crash, which killed all 100 passengers, 9 members of the crew aboard and 5 people who were on the ground in the town of Gonesse, where the plane crashed in a ball of fire.</p>
