        <p>Some early music ensembles are rather self-righteous about using only historically authentic instruments. But the most gratifying of such ensembles are those that enable you to forget that period instruments are being used at all, because the playing is itself so musical and interesting. That's what happened during Thursday night's concert by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment at Alice Tully Hall, part of the Mostly Mozart Festival.</p>
        <p>Since its founding in 1986, this acclaimed early music orchestra from Britain has been self-governed by the players. They regularly engage fine conductors to work with but just as often play by themselves, as on this occasion when the violinist Catherine Mackintosh, in the concertmaster's seat, served as the leader.</p>

        <p>Some early music ensembles are rather self-righteous about using only historically authentic instruments. But the most gratifying of such ensembles are those that enable you to forget that period instruments are being used at all, because the playing is itself so musical and interesting. That's what happened during Thursday night's concert by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment at Alice Tully Hall, part of the Mostly Mozart Festival.</p>
        <p>Since its founding in 1986, this acclaimed early music orchestra from Britain has been self-governed by the players. They regularly engage fine conductors to work with but just as often play by themselves, as on this occasion when the violinist Catherine Mackintosh, in the concertmaster's seat, served as the leader.</p>
        <p>Still, only long rehearsals and camaraderie can produce the kind of in-sync coordination, lucid phrasing, rhythmic incisiveness and expressivity that these players demonstrated, starting with their buoyant performance of a beguiling rarity, the short Symphony No. 8 by the 18th-century British composer William Boyce.</p>
        <p>The countertenor David Daniels, making his Mostly Mozart Festival debut, was the orchestra's guest, a most appropriate one, for, like the ensemble's use of period instruments, Mr. Daniels's utterly natural singing enables you to forget that he is a supposedly rarefied kind of vocal specialist. In four demanding arias from Handel operas, he was in excellent voice.</p>
        <p>On the long high note that begins the first phrase of ''Aure, deh, per pieta,'' from ''Giulio Cesare,'' he presented a textbook demonstration of ''messa di voce,'' the vocal technique in which a sustained tone begins softly, builds in sound and diminishes to the original soft dynamic. This was no feat of vocal gymnastics, but a heart-stopping expressive touch, one among many. Later, Mr. Daniels sang ''Venti, turbini'' from ''Rinaldo,'' an aria in which the brilliant, lickety-split coloratura passages for singer are often doubled by bassoon.</p>
        <p>And Andrew Watts, the orchestra's impressive bassoonist, matched Mr. Daniels note for note, earning a well-deserved ovation of his own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels concluded with two arias from ''Partenope,'' giving a dramatically urgent performance of ''Sento amor,'' then a deeply poignant account of the sublime ''Ch'io parta,'' which was nearly ruined by a coughing fit in Row N.</p>
        <p>Still, only an encore would satisfy the cheering audience. Mr. Daniels sang Handel's most familiar aria, ''Ombra mai fu,'' but with a dignity and simplicity that made it fresh.</p>
        <p>''Baroque England and the Spell of Italian Music'' was the title of the preconcert lecture and the theme of the program.</p>
        <p>Besides presenting a supple performance of Handel's Concerto Grosso, Op. 6, No. 8, and an engaging account of a suite from Purcell's music for ''The Virtuous Wife,'' the orchestra played a little-known Concerto Grosso in D Minor by Pietro Castrucci, a composer Handel discovered on a trip to Italy in 1715 and promptly brought back to London with him to serve as the concertmaster of his opera orchestra.</p>
        <p>This year the Mostly Mozart Festival has more guest ensembles participating than ever. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment has set a high standard for subsequent artists to meet.</p>
