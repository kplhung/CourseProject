        <p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, seeking to play a more active role in the presidential elections this year, is planning to mount a multimillion-dollar campaign to mobilize and register black voters.</p>

        <p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, seeking to play a more active role in the presidential elections this year, is planning to mount a multimillion-dollar campaign to mobilize and register black voters.</p>
        <p>The association plans to spend about $7 million on a wide-ranging campaign that is likely to include television, radio and newspaper advertising, direct mailings, phone banks, pamphlets, faxes and other tactics, officials said.</p>
        <p>The amount earmarked for the effort is relatively small compared with the costly standards of today's political campaigns. But it is a significant sum for an organization like the N.A.A.C.P., with an annual budget of $19 million. Its previous efforts have been largely limited to grass-roots voter education and registration, officials said.</p>
        <p>Andrea Pringle, a spokeswoman for the N.A.A.C.P.'s National Voter Fund, said the group would not endorse candidates in its drive to increase black voter participation.</p>
        <p>But she said the effort would highlight the records of presidential and Congressional candidates on issues that are important to blacks, Hispanics and other racial and ethnic minorities. Those issues, she said, include education, health care, civil rights and gun control.</p>
        <p>''There is a lot at stake'' in the November elections, Ms. Pringle said, adding: ''This is based on the N.A.A.C.P.'s belief that an informed voter is an empowered voter.'' The drive, she said, will be kicked off in the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>The N.A.A.C.P.'s campaign comes as some of its members have warned that the outcome of the presidential election in November could have a major impact on the course of civil rights. In particular, the members have voiced concern that another conservative member on the Supreme Court could be a major setback for that cause.</p>
        <p>Black voters now make up 15 percent of the electorate, and they usually provide overwhelming support for Democrats. But Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee, has been campaigning in black and Hispanic communities, in an effort to underscore his message of inclusiveness.</p>
