        <p>Fidela Caparas, 54, was driven to generosity. She was the head bookkeeper for a Manhattan magazine publisher, and she managed to wire millions to her native land, the Philippines, to help hospitals, churches and others in need. But prosecutors say she was most generous to herself, using phony paychecks to steal more than $10 million from her employer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Caparas worked 30 years for Harris Publications, a publisher of magazines on hunting and weaponry. At some point, she began to write herself a few company checks, a habit that escalated in recent years, according to Manhattan prosecutors and Harris.</p>
        <p>Since she stopped collecting paychecks in April, when she was fired, her luck has gone steadily downhill. She was indicted in May for grand larceny, and she is being held on Rikers Island without bail.</p>
        <p>And worse, while she is a beloved figure in her hometown of Cavitenos, prosecutors contend that her generosity was simply a quick way to dispose of ill-gotten gain.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a Manhattan judge refused to reconsider her bail application, even though she surrendered her American passport and argued that despite the ''palatial home'' prosecutors say she is building in the Philippines, her ties are now here. She denies the charges against her.</p>
        <p>Her bail was initially set at $750,000 after her arrest in May. But the judge withdrew the bail offer after prosecutors said that she had a Philippine passport that she had failed to mention, and that she might have stolen $9 million more than they had originally thought.</p>
        <p>Ms. Caparas's lawyer, Stephen Zissou, said that prosecutors had  grossly exaggerated the amount of money she gave away. He argued that the court had been unfair in its refusal to release her on bail, pointing out that she had been charged with a nonviolent offense and had no prior criminal record. And as for the contention that Ms. Caparas was a flight risk because she had ties to a foreign country, he said, ''Like 180 million Americans do.''</p>
        <p>Hers was an immigrant success story. With only a college degree in commerce from Far Eastern University in Manila, she made her way to New Jersey, became a citizen and worked her way up in classic fashion, her two sons attending college here.</p>
        <p>By 1970, she had joined Harris Publications, which produces magazines that dwell largely on security concerns. There, she eventually oversaw the payroll and expenses for all employees. She earned $150,000 a year and was soon dabbling in philanthropy.</p>
        <p>''It would be fair to say that she has engaged in substantial philanthropic endeavors,'' said her lawyer, Mr. Zissou.</p>
        <p>But, according to prosecutors, a preliminary audit found that she had inserted her name on the payee line of more than 50 checks that ranged from $15,000 to $75,000.</p>
        <p>She spent the money on cars, antiques and expensive homes in New Jersey, California and Florida, as well as real estate in the Philippines, prosecutors said. She also used it for an entertainment and production company that she headed, they said.</p>
        <p>When her employer confronted her, she admitted to stealing $800,000, prosecutors said. But the day after she was arrested, they said, she diverted $120,000 from her bank account through wire transfers to relatives in the Philippines.</p>
        <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation helped assess the damage to Harris, and the first estimate that $800,000 had been stolen was soon revised.</p>
        <p>Lillian Llambelis, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, told a judge that bank records that had been subpoenaed ''reveal that the amount of theft is far, far greater than was previously estimated.''</p>
        <p>The latest estimate came to more than $10 million.</p>
        <p>Harris executives could not be reached for comment, but prosecutors said that it was very unlikely that the company could recover its money. Ms. Llambelis told a judge: ''She knows what she stole. She knows where she's hidden it.''</p>
        <p>Some 100 community members wrote letters to the judge, pleading for leniency. Most cited Ms. Caparas's outstanding generosity.</p>
        <p>Her son Jeremy Jason Caparas wrote: ''One time, she even rented out a whole church and hall on Christmas for the mentally disabled home, bought all of them presents, and gave them a party with Santa and made them feel loved. No matter the cost, she was there for anyone.''</p>
        <p>The letters, of course, could backfire.</p>
