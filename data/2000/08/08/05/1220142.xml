        <p>The Rev. Francis Patrick Duffy got a spot in Times Square in 1936 for his heroics on the battlefield and the streets of Hell's Kitchen. George M. Cohan followed in 1959 as a tribute to one of show business's greatest song and dance men.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani says there is room for one more famous bronze guy out there on the crossroads of the world. The mayor and his office have taken a shine to Frank Sinatra, whose signature songs included, in 1980, ''New York, New York.'' The late entertainer's daughter, Nancy Sinatra, who first suggested the idea, has found a sculptor and promises to come up with the money. There is even talk of an interactive Sinatra, who would croon on command.</p>
        <p>''Nancy Sinatra is thrilled; this is her dream,'' said Charlotte Cohen of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, who has been involved in the plans. ''Everyone would love to see it done quickly.''</p>
        <p>But the hushed refrain playing around Times Square is not so gushing or welcoming. Start spreading the news, it goes. Not Here, Not Here.</p>
        <p>No one really wants to say so, at least not loudly enough to irk Mr. Giuliani or offend the Sinatra family, but the plan to erect a statue of Ol' Blue Eyes on a traffic island at 44th Street and Broadway (across the street from the site of the old Paramount Theater, where Sinatra made his first real splash in 1942) has acquired some enemies.</p>
        <p>The local community board, along with some Times Square developers, is not crazy about the idea of a new tourist attraction in a place where the sidewalks are already overwhelmed by crowds. And the theater moguls say the square's 100-year-old theatrical tradition would be shortchanged by showcasing a singer and film actor who started in Hoboken, N.J., made a quick sensation at the Paramount Theater and then followed fame and fortune west of the Hudson.</p>
        <p>Most everyone bristles at the thought of Mr. Giuliani as arbiter of Broadway celebrity. After stewing for months, the community board and other local groups decided to write a letter to the mayor asking for a meeting. They hope, at least, to get the statue moved to a less central location.</p>
        <p>''The real issue for a lot of us is, what is the association with Broadway?'' said Michael Presser, executive director of Inside Broadway, the theater industry's educational program with city schools. ''We see an extremely popular artist and legend, a man of great achievement, but we don't necessarily see someone who has been closely associated with New York theater. We feel he is due an honor, but we also question this particular spot in this particular neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>Sinatra fancied himself top of the heap in the city that doesn't sleep, but if the grumbling around Times Square is to be believed, New Yorkers would like less Las Vegas and Hollywood in their traffic-island idols. Times Square may be the center of the universe, but it is also a stronghold of Midtown provincialism: on the Great White Way, Sinatra, real or cast, is regarded as decidedly off Broadway.</p>
        <p>The mayor's office won't hear of it. Indeed, Anthony Carbonetti, Mr. Giuliani's chief of staff, says they have not heard of it.</p>
        <p>Any opposition to Sinatra?</p>
        <p>''That hasn't come up,'' Mr. Carbonetti replied.</p>
        <p>Does Sinatra deserve to be front and center in Times Square?</p>
        <p>''I definitely think so,'' he said. ''But I am an Italian-American who grew up listening to Frank Sinatra, and my father would disown me if I said anything to the contrary.''</p>
        <p>That the Sinatra insurrection is being staged largely in whispers and behind closed doors is not entirely surprising.</p>
        <p>At one level, it is downright embarrassing for naysayers to confess their misgivings in public. It is not easy to explain objections to a 10-foot monument to one of America's greatest pop singers, regardless of his New York pedigree, when Times Square is already home to a pro-wrestling restaurant and when the retailer Toys ''R'' Us is to build a 60-foot-tall indoor Ferris wheel across the street.</p>
        <p>''This particular community, which is now enjoying a very important renaissance period, should find a way to preserve a little history and culture but also make it interesting and attractive,'' Mr. Presser offered.</p>
        <p>There is also the problem of City Hall and a mayor who, as one Times Square community leader put it, is easy to make cranky.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sinatra went to Mr. Giuliani with the statue proposal shortly after her father died in Los Angeles in May 1998, city officials said. Mr. Carbonetti said she had apparently made the suggestion years earlier, but was encouraged to come back when her father was no longer living. Statues in New York, unlike street names in Sinatra's desert haunt of Palm Springs, Calif., are the exclusive domain of the departed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani loved the idea and, as he is sometimes inclined to do, gave the seal of approval without consulting particularly far and wide.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sinatra initiated a design competition last August, settling in December on Neil Estern, an accomplished Brooklyn Heights sculptor.</p>
        <p>The Sinatra-Giuliani plan was cast in stone before most anyone around Times Square got wind of it. Official notice to Times Square businesses came in January as a fait accompli from the City Department of Transportation, which owns the concrete swath of Broadway and Seventh Avenue that Sinatra will share with the armed forces recruiting booth.</p>
        <p>With big egos involved, both dead and alive, those with strong opinions are voicing them delicately.</p>
        <p>''I have been involved with the rehabilitation of Times Square with the Shubert for 25 years, from the beginning when it was a dirt heap going into the sewer,'' said Lee Silver, director of corporate relations at the Shubert Organization. ''We found along the way that hip shooting doesn't solve any problems and airing opinions before there is any real information is not the way to get things done. I have nothing to say about that statue.''</p>
        <p>A community meeting with city officials, and possibly Ms. Sinatra, is in the making. The session was proposed in May by the leaders of three of the area's most influential organizations: Community Board 5, the Times Square Business Improvement District and the Mayor's Midtown Citizens Committee.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Mr. Giuliani, the three community groups stayed away from questioning Sinatra's New York bona fides. Instead, they raised fears that another attraction in Times Square, already the human equivalent of an overrun anthill, would lock up the last piece of open space in the theater district.</p>
        <p>Most notably, the recruiting booth island doubles as Dick Clark's New Year's Eve stage, and it is also used to present Broadway on Broadway and numerous other public events. It amounts to little more than a Gotham-sized slice of concrete pizza, but it is all Times Square has got.</p>
        <p>''I don't necessarily think any statue would be appropriate for Times Square because we probably have enough going on,'' said David Diamond, executive director of the Stage Directors and Choreographers Foundation, who heads the community board's committee on Times Square. ''But I don't want to discount the possibility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Diamond's suggestion: Put Sinatra's statue in Hoboken and place a plaque honoring him at 1501 Broadway, the former Paramount Theater and now a World Wrestling Federation restaurant. It was there that thousands of screaming bobby-soxers -- 30,000 of them on Oct. 12, 1944 -- turned Sinatra into solo music's greatest pop sensation.</p>
        <p>And who should stand in for Sinatra on the recruiting booth island?</p>
        <p>''I don't want to be quoted on any name,'' Mr. Diamond said. ''I don't want to leave anyone out and offend someone.''</p>
        <p>But aren't they are all dead anyway?</p>
        <p>''They all have estates,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The mayor's office says it has already solved the overcrowding quandary by instructing Mr. Estern to come up with a design that would allow Sinatra to be carted off for special occasions. The Department of Transportation also has plans to restrict pedestrian access to the island to keep fans from spilling into the street and disrupting traffic.</p>
        <p>The city is still undecided about whether the statue should sing, reserving judgment until the implications for traffic and office workers can be studied. Mr. Estern says no one has talked to him about adapting his art into ''an elaborate juke box,'' as he called it, but he is clearly not enamored of the suggestion.</p>
        <p>''It has to have a public debate, after all this is a democracy,'' Mr. Presser said. ''This is a very public piece of land.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cohen, director of the Percent for Art program in the Department of Cultural Affairs, said the statue, as a privately financed project, has not received the intense scrutiny required when public money is expended. Nonetheless, she said, the statue must still be reviewed by the City Art Commission for design approval and by the Department of Transportation for traffic and safety considerations. It is unclear, however, whether either agency will hold a public hearing, she said.</p>
        <p>''I think if it is something the mayor wants, then I think there will be a statue,'' said a Midtown developer unwilling to speak if he were named. ''Is there support? There is support, I guess, official support.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Estern, an avid fan of Sinatra who regards the singer as the perfect fit for Times Square, also thinks the resilient showman will prevail. Look no further than Sinatra's own ode to the city, he said.</p>
        <p>''If I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere,'' Mr. Estern recited. ''It's up to you -- New York, New York.''</p>
