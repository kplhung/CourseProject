        <p>Watching the Republican National Convention from his living room, James Greer, a 54-year-old lawyer and an independent, found himself awash in pleasantness.</p>
        <p>It was Laura Bush, the wife of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who set the tone. ''She has a softer way,'' Mr. Greer said. ''She's really a plus.''</p>
        <p>Like movie critics, or perhaps Olympic judges, Mr. Greer and five other Milwaukee residents watched the convention, giving marks for style and substance, ready to catch any stumbles.</p>
        <p>In the end, all of them -- a die-hard Republican, a devoted Democrat and varying shades of independents -- agreed that while the convention was lacking in suspense, it was also free of missteps.</p>
        <p>On Monday night, one resident, Brian Colon, 27, a computer programmer, found comfort in Gen. Colin L. Powell's message that many Americans deserved help.</p>
        <p>Another resident, Chiquita Lee, a 63-year-old homemaker and a Republican, who is black, found it pleasing to watch Republicans ''of different colors -- this convention was really reaching out.''</p>
        <p>Paris Wright, a 36-year-old computer systems analyst, also expressed approval that Republicans ''realize that demographics are changing, and that they need to widen the umbrella.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Kathleen Wyman, a 59-year-old real estate agent, found the efforts at racial diversity a bit forced. ''Are these people really representative of the new Republicans?'' Ms. Wyman asked, muffling a chuckle. ''Of course they're not.''</p>
        <p>And for Carolyn Castore, 47, who works for a nonprofit organization, the feel-good tenor of the opening night was lacking in substance. ''It's like baby food,'' Ms. Castore, a Democrat, said, ''no flavor, no texture and designed to be easily swallowed.''</p>
        <p>On the convention's second night, Mr. Greer offered praise as he listened to speeches by Senator John McCain of Arizona and Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's chief international affairs adviser.</p>
        <p>''One thing Republicans do well is patriotism,'' Mr. Greer said. ''They have a knack for waving the flag.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Colon, so impressed by Mr. McCain, exclaimed, ''I wish I had this on tape!''</p>
        <p>But others were not convinced that Mr. McCain was speaking from his heart. ''McCain gives a very good speech,'' Ms. Wyman said, ''but I would bet that in his heart of hearts, he doesn't believe what he says about Bush.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lee was taken with Lynne Cheney, the wife of Dick Cheney, the vice-presidential candidate. ''She showed her devotion and love for her husband,'' she said, ''while still showing that she was her own person.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Wright, it was the tribute to past presidents, especially Ronald Reagan, that rang bells. ''It was really very moving,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday night, when Mr. Cheney  introduced himself to voters, the reviews from the Milwaukee residents were mostly favorable but hardly inspired.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lee found Mr. Cheney's speech to be a bit heavy on cliches. ''I think he has to grow on you,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Colon said, ''It was just a speech, not so good, not so bad.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Wyman found Mr. Cheney's talk to be ''rational and to the point.'' ''I can see this ticket being very attractive,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Castore said Mr. Cheney's speech was intended to shore up the conservative base. ''Until he spoke, the messages had been so progressive, that I was starting to feel sorry for the Republicans,'' she said. ''But Cheney, with the whole morality issue, seemed to be bringing back the base.''</p>
        <p>The Milwaukee residents paid most attention, not surprisingly, to the speech by Mr. Bush on Thursday night. Most considered the speech a success.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush ''looked presidential,'' Ms. Wyman said, and he ''comes across better than his father ever did.''</p>
        <p>In some places, she said, it was almost Reaganesque, ''the way he talked about real people and made things very clear.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greer noted that Mr. Bush ''didn't have his smirk,'' and said the candidate scored points by presenting himself ''as a human,'' especially when making references to his mother.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lee remarked at Mr. Bush's ''charisma, the friend-next-door appeal,'' and applauded his plans on education.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Castore, the praise was grudging. ''As a speech it was O.K., but I thought his attacks on Gore fell flat,'' she said, referring to Vice President Al Gore. ''A lot of what he said, it sounded good. But I don't know what it means. It lacked so many specifics.''</p>
        <p>But for Mr. Colon, who had started the week not certain whether he would vote for Mr. Bush or not, the speech was a clincher.</p>
        <p>''I just loved it,'' Mr. Colon said. ''I'm ready to march right out and vote for him.''</p>
