        <p>Gov. George W. Bush came roaring out of the Republican National Convention today by plane, train and automobile, intent on sustaining whatever momentum he had seized from the four-day extravaganza in Philadelphia, and focused on a group of swing states the Democrats won in the last two presidential elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, now officially the Republican presidential nominee, traveled from Pennsylvania to Michigan, with several stops in Ohio in between, to reiterate his vow to bring a new harmony and integrity to Washington, rejoice in the unity that he said the Republican Party had achieved and just plain grin. It was clear he was pleased with the convention, and with his own performance there.</p>
        <p>''I can't tell you how energized I am,'' he told a crowd of hundreds along a stretch of train tracks near downtown Pittsburgh, where he began a westward whistle-stop tour that consumed the bulk of his day. In a classic campaign tableau, he stood on a platform draped in red-white-and-blue bunting at the back of a rear railway car.</p>
        <p>''It won't be long now,'' Mr. Bush said, repeating a line from his convention speech that forecast the ouster of the Clinton-Gore team and the arrival of a Republican administration in its stead. ''Give us a chance to change America for the better, and it won't be long now.''</p>
        <p>For this post-convention tour, Mr. Bush introduced a new slogan, ''Change the Tone,'' reflecting his pledge to purge Washington of its partisan acrimony.</p>
        <p>But like parts of the remarks that both he and his running mate, Dick Cheney, delivered at the convention, their comments together on the campaign trail today occasionally amounted to partisan appeals. At a rally in Akron, Ohio, tonight, Mr. Cheney said he wanted ''to give our kids and our grandkids the kind of White House they can be proud of.''</p>
        <p>''We've all gotten a little tired of the Clinton-Gore operation,'' Mr. Cheney said. Then, taking a line from his convention speech, he added, ''Help is on the way.''</p>
        <p>And at the earlier stop in Pittsburgh, the crowd chanted: ''No more Gore! No more Gore!''</p>
        <p>The dissonance in Mr. Bush's day extended not just to tone in general but also to the specific topic of inclusion. At a prayer breakfast this morning in Philadelphia, he made a point of saying that ''the gateway to heaven has many different paths.''  But one of the invited guests, Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, archbishop of Philadelphia, explicitly condemned abortion and implicitly indicted marriage between homosexuals. The cardinal said that ''millions of children have been slaughtered'' and, in the context of what he saw as a trend toward redefining marriage, maintained that society was plagued by ''sexually unbridled permissiveness.''</p>
        <p>On his campaign plane today, Mr. Bush said he was not indulging in negative campaigning, against either President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>''When I say I'm going to bring honor and dignity to the White House,'' Mr. Bush said, ''that's what I'm going to do. And if people draw conclusions other than that, so be it.''</p>
        <p>Referring to some pointed jokes he made about Mr. Gore in his convention speech, he added: ''The idea of needling the opponent with good humor, that's what American politics should be about, as opposed to trying to tear people down and distort. And I'm going to continue pointing up differences, and I will do so in a respectful way and occasionally put a needle out there.''</p>
        <p>Several polls taken toward the end of the convention suggested that Mr. Bush was getting a good ''bounce'' from the event. For instance, a survey conducted by Voter.com found a 10-point bounce for the new nominee,  leaving him with 49 percent and Mr.  Gore with 31 percent. Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, had 6 percent, and Patrick J. Buchanan, the likely Reform Party nominee,  had 2 percent.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because those polls seemed so promising, the Bush campaign soft-pedaled them, so that Republicans would not be lulled into an outsized optimism about the governor's prospects, and to try to keep the inevitable tightening of the race from being portrayed as a downturn for him.</p>
        <p>''Listen,'' Mr. Bush said, ''there's going to be all kinds of polls and speculation between now and Election Day. And I understand that, and that's why I think it's so important for us to be patient and keep our eye on the finish line.''</p>
        <p>To help hold on to the sense of moment leading from the convention, Mr. Bush traveled today with his wife, Laura; Mr. Cheney; Mr. Cheney's wife, Lynne, and a larger group of his senior advisers than is typical. And he hit more than half a dozen cities on the train, whose route started in Pittsburgh and ended in Akron.</p>
        <p>The stops came as frequently as every 15 or 20 minutes, and Mr. Bush kept his remarks extremely brief, choosing general expressions of emotion rather than specific references to policy. Time and again, he said his favorite part of the convention was the speech by Laura Bush on Monday night, and he remarked on what a beautiful smile she had.</p>
