        <p>NOOTER-Eric. On August 3, age 50. Devoted and cherished husband of Patty Dann; adoring and delighted father of Jacob; beloved brother of Marjon, Eva and Nine, of Holland. Family, friends and colleagues at the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee mourn the untimely loss of a brilliant, athletic, passionate and charming Dutchman who called pinecones pineapples, and who crossed the globe as a husband and returned a father. ''Rust in vrede,'' dear friend. Services will be held at Plaza Memorial Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Ave., at 91st St., on Sunday, August 6, at 9:30AM.</p>
