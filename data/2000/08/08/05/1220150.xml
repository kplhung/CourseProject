        <p>A Queens man who was interviewed by television stations this week after his 81-year-old neighbor was slain outside her apartment door has been arrested in the killing, the authorities said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Eric Burton, 31, of 54-30 Beach Channel Drive in Far Rockaway, was charged with five counts of first- and second-degree murder, two counts of robbery and burglary and tampering with physical evidence in the killing last Tuesday of his neighbor, Maggie Stewart, officials said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart, who was known affectionately as Miss Maggie in the neighborhood where she had lived for 40 years, was stabbed to death and robbed in the fourth-floor hallway of the building where both she and the suspect lived, just steps from the door of her apartment.</p>
        <p>Neighborhood residents said that detectives had told them that Ms. Stewart had been stabbed 13 times. The police said that Mr. Burton followed his victim in the building and rode up in the elevator with her and attacked her in the hallway. After stabbing her, he took her keys and went into her apartment, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The police say they believe that he took money from her monthly Social Security payment.</p>
        <p>After the killing, at least two local television stations that covered the killing interviewed Mr. Burton, who lived in his mother's apartment a few doors away from Ms. Stewart.</p>
        <p>Asked about his neighbor, Mr. Burton told a reporter from WNYW, Channel 5, ''She doesn't bother anyone.'' When the reporter asked why anyone might kill Ms. Stewart, he said, ''I have no idea.''</p>
