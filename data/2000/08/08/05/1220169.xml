        <p>Danny Fortson got to ride in a black limousine, but that was about it. There was no star-studded video presentation as there was for Grant Hill, no yachting excursion as there was for Brian Grant, and no promise of a major role on the team.</p>

        <p>Danny Fortson got to ride in a black limousine, but that was about it. There was no star-studded video presentation as there was for Grant Hill, no yachting excursion as there was for Brian Grant, and no promise of a major role on the team.</p>
        <p>What Fortson, a 6-foot-7-inch power forward for the Boston Celtics, received yesterday was a tour of the Knicks' practice facility at SUNY-Purchase and this offer: If you work hard and play well, court time alongside Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson and Kurt Thomas might -- just might -- await you.</p>
        <p>''Right now, they're not making any promises or anything,'' Fortson said yesterday before touring Westchester County with General Manager Scott Layden and Coach Jeff Van Gundy. ''They've just discussed with me what the team needs and kind of left it at that.''</p>
        <p>While the Knicks may not have made Fortson feel like the league's most coveted player, they are interested in acquiring his services. They offered him the $2.25 million mid level salary-cap exception earlier this week, but Fortson and his agent, Raymond Brothers, turned it down.</p>
        <p>Fortson said he has narrowed his choices to the Knicks and the Golden State Warriors, who also are offering the midlevel exception, and that he hopes to decide next week. The Knicks may welcome the extra time because, while still a long shot, there is a possibility that they could obtain Grant, the Portland Trail Blazers forward.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, Grant turned down a seven-year, $90 million sign-and-trade offer that would have sent him to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Shawn Kemp. Having opted out of the final four years -- worth $40 million -- of his seven-year, $63 million contract with Portland, his decision leaves him with few options. One of them, besides returning to Portland, is to accept a midlevel exception from another team, perhaps the Miami Heat, Los Angeles Lakers or the Knicks.</p>
        <p>Miami will be significantly under the salary cap next season. So after playing for $2.25 million this year, Grant could receive a big payday from the Heat next season. It is doubtful that he would sign with the Lakers or the Knicks because they could not give him much of a pay raise.</p>
        <p>In all likelihood, Grant, who averaged 7.3 points and 5.5 rebounds last season, will return to Portland.</p>
        <p>The Knicks' best hope is that Cleveland, desperate to trade Kemp, will be forced into taking the best deal available, and will accept Marcus Camby and Chris Childs from the Knicks in a deal that would send Kemp to Portland and Grant to New York. Mark Bartelstein, Grant's agent, has been pushing for that deal, and the Knicks spoke with him yesterday after learning that Grant had balked at going to Cleveland.</p>
        <p>''We're going to continue to talk to Brian and see if there's a possibility of him coming to New York,'' Layden said. ''We're going to continue to work and try to get something done.''</p>
        <p>Fortson hopes the Knicks or Warriors can work a sign-and-trade deal with the Celtics so he could receive more money. He said much of his decision will come down to playing time. That would favor the Warriors, who would start him at power forward or play him roughly 30 minutes a game off the bench.</p>
        <p>''This decision is going to have a lot to do with my role on the team,'' said the 24-year-old Fortson. ''I have a good opportunity at Golden State to go in there and play as many minutes as I want. I definitely have to take that into consideration. I'm not getting any younger. I need to go out and do some damage while I can do it.''</p>
        <p>When given the opportunity, Fortson has done plenty of damage. Two years ago, he averaged 11 points and 11.6 rebounds in just 28 minutes per game for Denver. And he led the league in offensive rebounds, a category in which the Knicks ranked last in the National Basketball Association this past season. Last year, he averaged 6.7 rebounds in just 15.6 minutes per game for Boston. Despite his rebounding prowess, his stock has been limited by his lack of mobility and his tendency to foul.</p>
        <p>If the Knicks' top frontcourt players remain healthy, Fortson's minutes could remain sparse if he joined the team. In his eyes, that could override their ability to contend for the Eastern Conference championship.</p>
        <p>''I like to win, so that has something to do with it,'' Fortson said. ''But at the same time, I care about myself as far as developing into a good player, so I have to always keep that in the back of my mind -- where I'm going to go and become the best I can be.''</p>
        <p>Nets Sign Williams</p>
        <p>Aaron Williams, a 6-foot-9-inch journeyman forward, agreed to sign with the Nets for the $2.25 million midlevel exception last night, his agent, Mark Bartelstein, said. The details were being worked out, but Williams was expected to receive a six-year contract worth $17 million.</p>
        <p>The Nets will be the seventh team Williams, 28, has played for in seven N.B.A. seasons. After stints with Utah, Milwaukee, Denver, Vancouver and Seattle, Williams averaged career highs of 7.6 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.14 blocks and 19.1 minutes a game for Washington last season. He also shot 52.2 percent from the field.</p>
        <p>Williams, who chose the Nets over the Knicks, will back up Keith Van Horn at power forward.</p>
