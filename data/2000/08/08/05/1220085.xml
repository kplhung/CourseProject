        <p>Maurizio Pollini's reputation for hard thought can easily divert attention from the sheer sonic beauty of his pianism, rather as Debussy's reputation for misty drift can obscure the rigor and the intellectual adventurousness of his music. The two -- player and composer -- are well matched in a recording of the first book of the Debussy preludes (Deutsche Grammophon 289 445 187), on which Mr. Pollini produces captivating poetry that always has a mind to it.</p>
        <p>Right from the opening chords of the first prelude, ''Danseuses de Delphes,'' Mr. Pollini shows a keen appreciation of the risk Debussy was taking when, as he told his conservatory professor, he decided the only harmonic rule he would follow would be that of his pleasure. This was no soft option, for pleasure can be cruel. The harmonies here seem as troublesome as they are beautiful. They could go anywhere or nowhere. To travel to the particular somewhere Debussy wants, a certain effort against reluctance is needed.</p>

        <p>Maurizio Pollini's reputation for hard thought can easily divert attention from the sheer sonic beauty of his pianism, rather as Debussy's reputation for misty drift can obscure the rigor and the intellectual adventurousness of his music. The two -- player and composer -- are well matched in a recording of the first book of the Debussy preludes (Deutsche Grammophon 289 445 187), on which Mr. Pollini produces captivating poetry that always has a mind to it.</p>
        <p>Right from the opening chords of the first prelude, ''Danseuses de Delphes,'' Mr. Pollini shows a keen appreciation of the risk Debussy was taking when, as he told his conservatory professor, he decided the only harmonic rule he would follow would be that of his pleasure. This was no soft option, for pleasure can be cruel. The harmonies here seem as troublesome as they are beautiful. They could go anywhere or nowhere. To travel to the particular somewhere Debussy wants, a certain effort against reluctance is needed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollini registers this in the way he very subtly gives a separate weight to each chord and also in the buildup of violence he finds not just in this piece but also in many of its companions as well. It is as if the force going into making this strange and wonderful music had to erupt somewhere. Right in the middle of a picture of ancient Grecian priestesses or of undulating transparent surfaces in the ensuing ''Voiles'' comes a moment of anger and frustration that is the extreme end point of the beauty all around, beauty that Mr. Pollini renders with choice coloring in addition to his rhythmic care.</p>
        <p>Where the image of the music is already forceful, in ''Ce Qu'A Vu le Vent de l'Ouest,'' Mr. Pollini whirls up a fury. ''What the West Wind Saw'' in this case is a gale, with high Atlantic waves breaking at night over the rugged Breton shore and storm bells ringing. The virtuosity is immense and keeps the performance just this side of exaggeration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollini can also be charming, as in his high-speed, exhilarated ''Les Collines d'Anacapri'' or his nervily brilliant ''La Danse de Puck,'' and he puts all his sophistication at the service of simplicity in ''La Fille aux Cheveux de Lin.'' One of his most poignant moments comes near the end of ''La Serenade Interrompue,'' where -- after all the broken-off and jumbled Spanish patterns, which he makes at once funny and dark with low-register resonances -- a melody snakes up, sounding completely uncertain about where to go.</p>
        <p>After his disappointing recording of the ''Etudes,'' Mr. Pollini offers amends in pieces that he makes sound just as extraordinary as the later set. The intensity of his commitment and the range of his passion come across strongly. The occasional grunt confirms them. ''Minstrels,'' with its ragtime comedy vigorously projected, makes a splendid finale. ''L'Isle Joyeuse'' is added as an encore piece.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollini's Chopin collection (Deutsche Grammophon 289 459 683) also shows his impatience with being merely beautiful and a surprising vehemence, even harshness. In the Ballades, where good musical form is so strained and stretched and the expressive moment is valued almost as much as it is in Debussy, Mr. Pollini is right at home. The primary material of the First Ballade rushes and relaxes in its searching progress, creating the conditions for the secondary theme, which is finely sung. But tension rises all through, and the final measures have terror in them.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Pollini never forgets what a remarkable contrapuntalist the composer was. Bass lines are expectedly strong, and the middle parts are given voices. Along with the Ballades, Mr. Pollini offers a magical account of the nocturnal Prelude in C sharp minor, Opus 45, and a tumultuous one of the F minor Fantasy.</p>
