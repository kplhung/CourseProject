        <p>Coach Richie Adubato of the Liberty did not need added incentive to motivate his players last night. They entered their game against the Orlando Miracle with an 11-game winning streak and a spot in the Women's National Basketball Association playoffs.</p>
        <p>But Adubato, who likes to play all the angles, pasted an article from The Orlando Sentinel to the chalkboard in the Liberty locker room at Madison Square Garden. In the article, several Miracle players said the Liberty played a zone against them last month ''because they couldn't play man-to-man.''</p>
        <p>With a devilish grin, Adubato said his players did indeed play a zone defense in that loss to the Miracle. Last night, the Liberty didn't have to. Not for long anyway.</p>
        <p>The Miracle (14-15) was no match for the newly inspired Liberty (19-10). Neither trash-talk nor the sight of the All-Star Teresa Weatherspoon being carried off the court with a broken nose could break the Liberty's poise or determination.</p>
        <p>The Liberty staved off a second-half rally by the Miracle and won, 70-57, mostly because of their All-Star center, Tari Phillips, who used to play for the Miracle.</p>
        <p>Phillips, who was selected by the Portland Fire in the expansion draft only to be traded to the Liberty at the start of the season, showed her former teammates what they lost when their team chose to leave her unprotected. She finished the game with 18 points, 5 steals and 7 rebounds.</p>
        <p>''When you're an athlete and there is a lot of talk going on, the real talk comes on the court,'' Phillips said.</p>
        <p>One of the best matchups was between Phillips and Taj McWilliams, who had 13 points and a game-high 14 rebounds for Orlando.</p>
        <p>''It was a terrific battle between two of the premier players in the league in the low-post position,'' Adubato said.</p>
        <p>The Liberty needs to win one of its remaining three games to clinch the Eastern Conference title, and last night's victory may have come at a cost. With 7 minutes 32 seconds remaining, Weatherspoon, the Liberty's floor leader, tripped over guard Shannon Johnson's foot while driving to the basket and was hurled headfirst into a cameraman. She fractured her nose and was on the floor for three minutes before she was helped off the court.</p>
        <p>The sight of Weatherspoon at courtside with less than two minutes remaining brought the crowd to its feet. By then the Miracle was within five points. The Liberty responded with a 10-0 run in the final two minutes to seal the victory. Weatherspoon was taken to a hospital and held overnight for observation.</p>
        <p>''We won't know anything until tomorrow,'' Adubato said. ''She hit something on the camera when she landed out of bounds.''</p>
