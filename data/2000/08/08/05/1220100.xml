      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas got a clear bump upward from his acceptance speech and the Republican convention generally, but its dimensions and duration were uncertain.</p>
        <p>Politicians around the nation said Mr. Bush had succeeded in his most immediate task, using his first big-audience national appearance to begin the task of showing himself to be a serious, plausible national leader.</p>
        <p>''He looked and sounded like a leader, a potential president,'' said Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster.</p>
        <p>One Republican stalwart, former Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, said after watching the convention on television: ''I feel better about my party than I have in a long, long time. It had just the right tone. It's remarkable that Republicans staked out significant issues that were the preserve of the Democrats, like Social Security and education.''</p>
        <p>One overnight poll, conducted for NBC News, indicated that Mr. Bush's lead over Vice President Al Gore had gone from 6 percentage points to 11. Candidates almost always gain after a convention, and Mr. Teeter, who conducted this poll with Peter Hart, a Democrat, called it ''a normal, an average bounce.'' Another poll, by the Tarrance Group, said the margin had gone from 8 points to 18.</p>
        <p>While the Tarrance poll showed an especially big gain among independents, there were indications in some focus-group studies that Mr. Bush's attacks on Mr. Gore had played badly among such voters. Frank Luntz, who conducted a conventionlong focus group of 36 uncommitted voters for MSNBC, said, ''Virtually every criticism received a negative reaction.''</p>
        <p>That was a point hit hard for the Gore campaign by Bob Shrum, a consultant who works on major speeches and television advertisements. ''I don't think the speech will wear well,'' Mr. Shrum said, ''because he engaged in the kind of personal attacks that don't work with independent voters and don't work with undecided voters.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shrum also struck a major Democratic theme when he said, ''Ultimately, people are going to come to the issues.'' Then, he said, they will reject Mr. Bush's tax plan, which ''gives $50,000 a year to a millionaire and a dollar a day to the working man.''</p>
        <p>''I think their whole convention was an effort to mention issues without debating them or explaining their real positions,'' Mr. Shrum said.</p>
        <p>That will be a major theme of the Democratic convention, contending that the Bush proposals on issues like Social Security, taxes, education and health will not work and will favor only the rich. Democrats will also strongly criticize his record in Texas on the environment and health.</p>
        <p>But that tack, Mr. Luntz warned, carries risks. The universal anti-attack mode of his focus group suggested, he said, that ''we live in an age of pleasantry'' when attacks function like an inward-facing ''circular firing squad'' and wound the attackers.</p>
        <p>Neither poll was able to pinpoint states where the convention had most helped Mr. Bush. G. Terry Madonna, a pollster at Millersville University in Pennsylvania, said that in his state, which is a crucial swing state, ''I don't really know that it moved a lot of suburban voters, and in Pennsylvania, I am absolutely convinced that the election depends on the suburbs.''</p>
        <p>The NBC poll gave Mr. Bush 47 percent to 36 percent for Mr. Gore, 6 percent for Ralph Nader and 1 percent for Patrick J. Buchanan. Before the convention, it had 44 percent for Mr. Bush, 38 percent for Mr. Gore, 6 percent for Mr. Nader and 2 percent for Mr. Buchanan.</p>
        <p>The Tarrance Group poll, a two-day survey completed on Thursday with only a few interviews after the governor's acceptance speech, gave Mr. Bush 49 percent, Mr. Gore 31 percent, Mr. Nader 6 percent and Mr. Buchanan 2 percent. When the convention began, the numbers were 46 percent for Mr. Bush, 38 percent for Mr. Gore, 3 percent for Mr. Nader and 2 percent for Mr. Buchanan. Ed Goeas of the Tarrance Group said that Mr. Bush's gains were widespread among various demographic groups, and that Mr. Gore lost strength among Democrats.</p>
        <p>Whatever the extent of Mr. Bush's  gain, it is unclear whether it will be lasting. Andrew Kohut, a pollster and director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, said, ''Is it a blip or a bounce? There are as many blips in recent elections as there are booms.''</p>
        <p>In 1996, for example, President Clinton got no spurt in popularity after his convention and Bob Dole, the Republican candidate, did gain, but it was brief.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, convention week was the best week of Mr. Dole's campaign, but Republicans in Philadelphia were insisting this week that they had held out no real hopes then, while this time they expected to win.</p>
        <p>Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania called the 1996 session in San Diego ''a very respectful convention,'' where delegates loved Mr. Dole and his running mate, Jack F. Kemp, because of their efforts to campaign for Republicans over the year. But, he continued, the delegates knew ''they had one hell of a steep climb'' to defeat Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Many Republicans said the best comparison to a past convention was to 1980 in Detroit. Michael K. Deaver, who worked on Ronald Reagan's staff, said the task back then was to show the seriousness of a ''governor from the West with no foreign policy experience, who seemed maybe a little light, read from speech cards, maybe didn't have an independent thought.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's situation, Mr. Deaver said, was similar to Mr. Reagan's in 1980. Then, he said, there were ''people not wanting to vote for Carter, but not being quite sure that Reagan was up to the job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan's effective convention speech was a beginning for that reassurance, which was capped when Mr. Reagan debated Mr. Carter in October.</p>
        <p>The one convention that no one here wanted to remember was the last one in that city, where Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, favored in the polls, strengthened his ticket with a widely hailed running mate, Gov. Earl Warren of California. Mr. Dewey spoke confidently of unity in an acceptance speech characterized by his biographer, Richard Norton Smith, in ''Thomas E. Dewey and His Times,'' as short, dignified and ''the speech of a man already elected.''</p>
        <p>On June 25, 1948, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin's front-page, end-of-convention headline proclaimed, ''Dewey Leaves, Sure He'll Win.''</p>
