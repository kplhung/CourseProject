        <p>After suffering days of Republican barbs in silence, Vice President Al Gore returned from vacation today swinging back hard, accusing the Republicans of running a showy, but insubstantial convention and strongly claiming credit for having helped create the nation's roaring economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore had spent the week with his family on a North Carolina beach while the newly minted Republican ticket of Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney used the stage in Philadelphia to portray the Clinton administration as timid, ineffectual and lacking vision.</p>
        <p>The Republican nominees left Philadelphia today for a day filled with campaign stops in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio. Mr. Bush  showed a post-convention lift of his own while speaking to a crowd of  hundreds along downtown train tracks in Pittsburgh. ''I can't tell you how energized I am,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Chicago, Mr. Gore answered the Republican criticisms today by slinging arrows of his own. Without mentioning Mr. Bush or Mr. Cheney by name, he accused the Republicans of trying to paper over empty promises and harsh policies with a feel-good, slickly choreographed convention that offered little more than ''confetti and klieg lights.''</p>
        <p>''When it comes to political pageantry, I've got to hand it to the other side,'' Mr. Gore told more than 3,000 members of the International Association of Fire Fighters. ''But you and I both know that a slogan never put out a raging fire. A sound bite never saved a child from a burning building. And political positioning will never heal sick children who don't have health care.''</p>
        <p>Playing the role he seems most comfortable with, the counterpuncher, Mr. Gore appeared to relish reusing one of his own lines from the 1992 campaign that Mr. Cheney had appropriated in Philadelphia: ''It's time for them to go.''</p>
        <p>''Two nights ago at the convention, we heard their view of what time it is,'' Mr. Gore told the firefighters. ''That was a familiar line wasn't it? I remember that one. Well let me tell you what time it's not. It's not time to give in to the big drug companies. It is not time to give in to big insurance companies.''</p>
        <p>''And our opponents may not like to hear it, but it is not recession time in America like it was back in 1992,'' he continued. ''It's not deficit time in America like it was in 1992.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore entered a Chicago hotel this morning looking like a gladiator on an adrenaline high, pumping his fists as he led a group of chanting firefighters dressed in yellow T-shirts emblazoned with the words, ''Fire Fighters for Gore.''</p>
        <p>Inside, he spent nearly 10 minutes wending his way through the crowded aisle toward the stage, slapping high-fives, grabbing every outstretched hand, cradling an infant.</p>
        <p>''I know we're starting out behind,'' he said. ''I'm here today to serve notice: this is Day 1 of the fight for working families. And with your help, we're going to win it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers are hoping to fill the next 10 days with events like the one today, first to dampen any post-convention bounce in the polls that the Republicans are likely to receive, and then to build enthusiasm for Mr. Gore's own triumphal entrance into the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles on Aug. 16.</p>
        <p>Later today, Mr. Gore spoke here before more than 8,000 letter carriers, and on Saturday he will address a convention of the National Association of Police Organizations in Washington.</p>
        <p>Today's speeches offered a preview of the themes Mr. Gore will emphasize in the coming week and at the convention.</p>
        <p>He fired populist attacks against the Republicans, describing their convention as ''a masquerade ball for special interests'' and repeating the refrain, ''They're for the powerful, and we're for the people.''</p>
        <p>He pledged to oppose tax cuts for the rich, bolster Social Security, improve public schools, provide tax breaks for the middle class, raise the minimum wage by a dollar and make it easier for workers to form unions.</p>
        <p>And, as if to answer critics within his own party who contend that he has not done enough to reveal his personal side to voters, he salted his speech with more biography than usual, saying, ''I also want the American people to know me for who I am.''</p>
        <p>He then dwelt heavily on his time in Vietnam as an journalist in the Army, offering an implicit contrast to Mr. Bush, who served in the Texas Air National Guard, never leaving the country.</p>
        <p>''When I was in Vietnam, I didn't do the most or run the greatest danger,'' Mr. Gore said. ''But I volunteered and enlisted because I loved my country, and I knew that if I didn't go, I knew that someone else from my home town of Carthage, Tenn., would have to go in my place.''</p>
        <p>Left out of that explanation are two other possible reasons for his decision to volunteer: his desire to help insulate his father, an antiwar senator from Tennessee, from Republican criticism, and his own interest in broadening his resume for a possible career in politics.</p>
        <p>The vice president was accompanied by his wife, Tipper, who was expected to spend significantly more time campaigning for her husband in the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>Responding to one of Mr. Bush's harsher attacks -- that the Clinton administration had coasted through eight years of prosperity, choosing ''the path of least resistance'' -- Mr. Gore said: ''What planet have they been on?''</p>
        <p>He then claimed partial credit for starting the nation's economic recovery by casting a tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the president's 1993 economic stimulus plan.</p>
        <p>And he recalled the efforts of the Republican-controlled Congress, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, to shut down the government in 1995, which polls showed to be highly unpopular with voters.</p>
        <p>''I wish there had been less resistance,'' he said. ''I broke the tie when every Republican voted no on the economic change that has brought about this prosperity. I wish there had been less resistance and that they didn't shut down the government twice.''</p>
