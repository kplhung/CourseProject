        <p>Even though he has driven 8,493 winners, Dave Magee has never had a horse fast enough to compete in the Hambletonian. As the pilot of Dreamaster, the early-line favorite, Magee will try to capture the ultimate event in harness racing in his first attempt on Saturday afternoon at the Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>''I'm really excited about this,'' Magee said at the draw for the post positions, where his horse was assigned the No. 3 spot. ''I've been dreaming about this ever since I was a little boy.''</p>
        <p>Dreamaster is the season's only unbeaten horse and heads the field of 10 in the 75th edition of the $1 million Hambletonian, the richest event in harness racing. He has won all six starts, but at 3-1 odds, he is not considered an overwhelming favorite. In all but one of the last seven Hambletonians, the favorite for the final went off at odds lower than even money.</p>
        <p>After Dreamaster, the second choice is Uhadadream at 7-2, with Yankee Paco the third choice at 4-1. Legendary Lover K, who finished second to Dreamaster in the eliminations, is the fourth choice at 6-1.</p>
