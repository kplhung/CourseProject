        <p>Twenty-four delightful and exhausting hours later, Darrell Waltrip's right hand was killing him. Waltrip, flexing his hand and balling it into a fist again and again, said he could deal with the pain that only politicians on whistle-stop tours can really know.</p>
        <p>So many people were so happy for Waltrip after he made the front row for Saturday's Brickyard 400 with a surprisingly speedy qualifying run that they offered jubilant, hearty handshakes deep into Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the handshakes were a little too hearty. The popular, self-deprecating, high-voltage veteran said he was actually tired when he showed up for work this morning, and he joked that he thought his hand would fall off if one more person shook it.</p>
        <p>And yet, in a way, he had not felt this invigorated in a long time.</p>
        <p>When his qualifying run was over Thursday, Waltrip stood in front of the main grandstand at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and did a crowd-pleasing reprise of the dance he borrowed from Ickey Woods, the former Cincinnati Bengals running back, when he won the Daytona 500 in 1989.</p>
        <p>Now Waltrip, 53, midway through a discouraging final season on the Nascar Winston Cup circuit, has a chance to start a race at the front of the pack, not the back. This was how his ''Victory Tour'' was supposed to work.</p>
        <p>He has not won a race in eight years and has not finished better than 22nd in any Winston Cup race this year, but he has vowed to do the most with this chance to win, because this chance might be his last.</p>
        <p>''Like they say, a blind hog should be able to find an acorn every once in a while, and I thought this old blind hog would be able to find an acorn or two,'' Waltrip said as he sat on a jack in his garage this afternoon.</p>
        <p>''I didn't think we'd be great,'' he said, ''but I didn't think we'd be as bad as we've been sometimes. But I don't think we'll go back to the same place and make the same mistakes now.''</p>
        <p>By earning a starting spot next to Ricky Rudd, the pole-sitter, Waltrip has given the seventh Brickyard 400 some extra sizzle.</p>
        <p>Jeremy Mayfield, who was leading the July 23 race at Long Pond, Pa., until he blew a tire midway through the last lap, slammed the wall during practice this morning and sustained a concussion that was serious enough to keep him out of the race. His place is to be taken by Kyle Petty, who failed to qualify in his own car.</p>
        <p>The chase for the Winston Cup championship is on low boil. Dale Jarrett has climbed over Dale Earnhardt into second place in the Winston Cup standing and is just 53 points behind the leader, Bobby Labonte. But Earnhardt, hungry for his eighth Winston Cup championship, has sounded particularly eager to win this race.</p>
        <p>Earnhardt even found time to tease his nemesis Jeff Gordon, the one-time wonderboy and two-time Brickyard 400 champion from nearby Pittsboro, Ind.</p>
        <p>Gordon turned 29 today, and Earnhardt said, ''He's finally become a man.''</p>
        <p>''He knows I'll get him back some time,'' Gordon said in response.</p>
        <p>Waltrip, who plans to join the Fox network next year as a racing commentator, does not have the benefit of time.</p>
        <p>That made his 180.923-miles-an-hour qualifying run Thursday electrifying. Rudd sounded somewhat disappointed that he took the pole position away 24 minutes later. Waltrip has not sat on the pole for a race since 1995.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt that Darrell had one of the best runs he's had in many, many years,'' Rudd said today.</p>
        <p>The run was encouraging enough for Waltrip's young team. He says he considers himself to be a teacher for his team, which includes Larry Carter, a first-year crew chief. The lessons have mostly been unpleasant.</p>
        <p>Waltrip has not qualified for three races this year and is 38th in the points standing.</p>
        <p>Carter said today that one of his goals was simply to get Waltrip through his final season without serious incident.</p>
        <p>''We'd love to win one for him now,'' Carter said. ''We've just got to get everything right for him.''</p>
        <p>Rather than worrying about merely making the race in the final round of qualifying -- as Waltrip has had to do in all but three races this year -- Carter and Waltrip used a two-hour practice this morning to get ready for the race. That, Waltrip said, was a luxury.</p>
        <p>But to those who have said he has stuck around too long, becoming sort of a Willie Mays with horsepower, Waltrip offers a tart reply.</p>
        <p>''It's hard for me to do what I do on Sundays,'' he said. ''And it'd be very easy for me to say: 'O.K., I'm not competitive anymore. I quit.' ''</p>
        <p>He will be quitting soon enough. He has one more chance to win one more race, which would be his 85th and would put him ahead of Bobby Allison alone in third place among Winston Cup drivers.</p>
        <p>Waltrip loves this place, loves its rich history, loves driving here. He will not guarantee victory, but he said he does not plan to embarrass himself, either.</p>
        <p>''I just don't want to fall back to last place,'' he said, smiling.</p>
