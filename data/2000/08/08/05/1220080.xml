        <p>The crash of the Air France supersonic Concorde brought down a plane that by common measurements can hardly be profitable, given its high maintenance costs, daunting fuel bills, little passenger space, and no cargo.

        <p>The crash of the Air France supersonic Concorde brought down a plane that by common measurements can hardly be profitable, given its high maintenance costs, daunting fuel bills, little passenger space, and no cargo. Yet any decision to permanently ground the Concorde could have deep financial implications for the two airlines that run it.</p>
        <p>Airline industry analysts say the Concorde is part of a strategy, particularly by British Airways, to lure high-end corporate travelers, the favored target of airlines, to the Concorde's speedy flights between the financial capitals of London and New York, and to connecting flights on slower aircraft beyond. Its loss, they say, would divert these customers to other airlines, notably in the United States, or to corporate jet travel.</p>
        <p>''It helps to tie in your very high- end customers,'' said Damien Horth, an analyst at ABN-Amro in London.</p>
        <p>Neither airline has suggested it would quit flying the Concorde because of the crash, the first deadly accident in the plane's 25-year history. But talk that the Concorde has outlived its usefulness has persisted, and no other supersonic jetliners are in development.</p>
        <p>In Paris today, Air France employees called on the airline to resume flying the remaining six Concordes, which were grounded by the French transport ministry until experts could clarify the cause of the crash July 25 that killed 113 people.</p>
        <p>British Airways resumed its Concorde flights the day after the crash, but the planes have been flying half empty, and mechanical and safety issues have haunted nearly every flight. On Tuesday, for instance, the London-New York flight was delayed 75 minutes because of an engine problem and the passengers had to board a second Concorde, losing most of the time they would have gained from the plane's high speed.</p>
        <p>Revenue from the Concorde is estimated to account for only 1 percent to 2 percent of the total at Air France, and slightly more at British Airways. Yet Robin Horne, an analyst at HSBC Securities in London, says neither airline is entirely open about the Concorde's financial performance, and he believes that the planes ''don't make much money.''</p>
        <p>Depreciation -- the decreased value of something because of wear and tear -- has never been a factor in accounting for the operating cost of the Concorde, as it is for other aircraft. The reason is that the planes were in effect given to the airlines by the British and French governments, which footed the bill for their development.</p>
        <p>Yet almost alone among commercial jetliners, the Concorde carries a cockpit crew of three instead of two, and it lacks cargo capacity. Crew members work fewer hours than on subsonic planes and their training is almost twice as long as that of other pilots, and hence more costly.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the Concorde is more expensive to maintain. British Airways says its seven Concordes get up to 57 hours of maintenance for every hour in the air, far more than what is accorded subsonic aircraft. Fuel consumption, too, makes them expensive to run. The Concorde burns about 4,670 gallons of kerosene for every hour of flight, compared with 2,340 gallons for the Boeing 747-400, Boeing's biggest aircraft. Yet the 747 carries roughly 400 passengers, four times that of the Concorde.</p>
        <p>Thus, many analysts believe that a modern Boeing 747 or 777, with several dozen first-class passengers, who pay only about 20 percent less than on the Concorde, easily earns as much as or more than a Concorde.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure how profitable they are,'' said Matthew Stainer, an analyst at SG Securities. Given its fuel-guzzling habits, he added, the Concorde has felt the brunt of recent increases in airline fuel prices ''more than most of the fleet.''</p>
        <p>And yet, despite its marginal profitability, analysts say the Concorde more than earns its keep, at least for British Airways, by its ability to draw large numbers of first-class and business-class travelers, who pay high premiums. Cutting the Concorde out of the fleet, said Daniel Solon, director of Avmark International, a London airline consulting firm, would expose the airlines to a ''double hazard.''</p>
        <p>Though it is hard to quantify, as economies globalize and New York and London have emerged as the world's principal financial centers, British Airways has capitalized on increased traffic between Wall Street and the City, London's financial district -- effectively using the Concorde to lure what some analysts call the ''Goldman Sachs crowd.''</p>
        <p>Particularly on westbound traffic, analysts said, the Concorde is attractive to corporate executives and investment bankers since it enables them to cheat the clock, arriving in New York at an earlier local hour than they left London or Paris.</p>
        <p>A further inducement to the premium traveler has been the Concorde service's preferential treatment of passengers that expedites them through customs, passport control and baggage checking, and offers them a traveling environment closer to that of a corporate jet, yet at supersonic speed.</p>
        <p>But both British Airways and Air France have also been able to attract premium travelers from farther afield, enabling customers from, say, Dubai or Moscow, to travel to London or Paris, then take the Concorde on to New York. ''Concorde is a fantastic marketing tool for B.A.,'' said Mr. Horne of HSBC.</p>
        <p>Without the Concorde, to be sure, some of these travelers would shift to subsonic flights offered by British Airways or Air France. But experts like Mr. Solon believe many would instead use corporate jets. Others, particularly Americans, would desert British Airways and Air France, preferring to fly their customary United States airline, they said.</p>
