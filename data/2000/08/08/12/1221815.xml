        <p>Some 3,000 players began 10 days of play here today in the American Contract Bridge League's Summer National Championships, but the focus of attention was on the final stages of the Grand National Teams (Flight A).</p>
        <p>This began at the grass-roots level nine months ago, and it is the only event in the calendar in which teams represent a geographical zone.</p>
        <p>In one semifinal today, Florida faces Chicago, and in the other Northern California opposes Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>In the diagramed deal from an earlier round, the West player missed a rare opportunity for brilliance. He was defending against four spades, reached after his partner had opened one diamond and South had overcalled one spade. North's double of three diamonds was responsive, showing moderate values with length in the unbid suits.</p>
        <p>West led his singleton club, which was ducked to the declarer's nine. Two trump winners were cashed, leaving this position:</p>
        <p>[Diagram]</p>
        <p>South desperately needed an entry to the dummy to take a club finesse. The bidding made it virtually certain that the heart ace was on his right, but he could hope for the queen to be on his left. A routine lead of the heart jack was likely to fail, for East would no doubt hold up the ace.</p>
        <p>So South led the heart six and finessed dummy's ten. He now had the entry he needed for the club finesse and made his game.</p>
        <p>Too late, West discovered that he should have put up the heart queen, blocking South out of the dummy and defeating the game. This rare move is often noted in post-mortems but seldom made at the table.</p>
        <p>In the replay North-South reached four hearts, a five-two fit instead of a six-two.</p>
        <p>Curiously, this proved to be an easier contract, for North was able to establish the spades by ruffing. He lost two heart tricks and a diamond trick, and neither team gained on the deal.</p>
