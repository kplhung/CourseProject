      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Daily Soup Company, one of the city's better-known high-end soup operations, has sold eight of its nine stores, has shut the ninth and plans to offer its fare at less costly kiosks and other small sites as well as through food markets.</p>
        <p>The Aug. 1 sale and the shutdown, necessitated by a bankruptcy reorganization, highlight the financial difficulties that have befallen many of the soup stores that appeared to pop up everywhere in the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>Their operators have found that it can be hard to pay the rent year round when the main product is as highly seasonal as it is highly seasoned. Soup sales sag in summer, and charging up to $7 for 12 ounces of steamy brew is often not enough to make up for the hot-weather dips in patronage and revenue -- a problem aggravated when overexpansion causes too much money to be spent on opening too many shops.</p>
        <p>Many of the soup operations have closed, shrunk, or, like the Hale and Hearty Soups chain, stayed afloat by adding substantial offerings of salads, sandwiches and other items.</p>
        <p>Although the Daily Soup outlets have been under new ownership since the start of the month, and other kitchens are producing the soups ladeled out there, the Daily Soup signs remain on the shops.</p>
        <p>The new owner of the eight outlets in Midtown and Lower Manhattan is the food-shop chain Devon &amp; Blakely. It has the right to use the Daily Soup name at the shops and is continuing to do so, even as the shop's former owners have retained the right to use the name at the smaller sites they plan and on the refrigerated product they sell through supermarkets.</p>
        <p>Devon &amp; Blakely will also continue operating its own five food shops in Manhattan, which the company's operations director, James Turner, described as purveying ''high-end fast food.'' He said that his company would ''introduce our salad bar and some other food offerings'' in the Daily Soup shops and that the nonsoup offerings there would go well beyond the limited salads and sandwiches that the former owners had added. As for the soups, ''We're not selling their soup,'' he said. ''We have other manufacturers that are providing specialty soups.''</p>
        <p>Under the former owners, the soups were made at the Daily Soup Company's kitchen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The new owners will generally keep the old owner's prices ''for the time being,'' Mr. Turner said.</p>
        <p>The Daily Soup site that has been closed is on Eighth Avenue near 43rd Street.</p>
        <p>Rich O'Donnell, president of the Daily Soup Company, which is being phased out, and of BCD Foods, a new company that has bought all of Daily Soup's nonstore assets -- including the kitchen and sole rights to the recipes -- declined to give the sales price for the eight other stores.</p>
        <p>Aside from Mr. O'Donnell, the new company's owners are two of the people who founded the Daily Soup Company in 1995, Carla Ruben and Robert Spiegel, and that company's chef, Leslie Kaul, who will also continue as chef under the BCD operation.</p>
        <p>The operation will not only include the sales of the BCD company's Daily Soup at general food stores and at the smaller soup-only outlets  planned ''throughout the metropolitan area'' in the next year, Mr. O'Donnell said. It will also include an expansion of the nonsoup items, like pot pies and Asian noodle salads, that the Daily Soup Company began producing last year for supermarket sales under the stores' labels.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Donnell, who joined the Daily Soup Company in 1998, said that the ''stores themselves were always profitable'' but that ''overzealous expansion'' had put the company in bankruptcy court.</p>
        <p>In an e-mail message sent to Daily Soup patrons on Thursday, Mr. O'Donnell said that ''from the comments I have been hearing, most of you have already realized'' that the soup now being sold at the Daily Soup shops is not ''Leslie's soup.''</p>
        <p>But at the shop on West 54th Street near Broadway yesterday -- where the offerings included Atlantic seafood chowder and something called Italian-style wedding soup -- one patron who had often lunched on soup there before the ownership change did not mind.</p>
        <p>''It tastes good,'' Julia Ulrich, 27, said as she perched on a stool and spooned her wedding soup.</p>
