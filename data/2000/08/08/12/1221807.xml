        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The religious summit meeting that you refer to in an Aug. 7 editorial is an event organized by people outside of the United Nations. The United Nations did not extend the invitations, and so cannot ''reverse itself'' and invite the Dalai Lama, as you propose. Invitations were extended by the organizers, in consultation with an interfaith advisory council of religious leaders, scholars and theologians.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The religious summit meeting that you refer to in an Aug. 7 editorial is an event organized by people outside of the United Nations. The United Nations did not extend the invitations, and so cannot ''reverse itself'' and invite the Dalai Lama, as you propose. Invitations were extended by the organizers, in consultation with an interfaith advisory council of religious leaders, scholars and theologians.</p>
        <p>The meeting, which will be attended by more than 1,000 religious leaders from around the world, is being organized and paid for by an independent group of people active with interfaith nonprofit, nongovernment organizations. The three-day event will take place at the United Nations and the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel this month.</p>
        <p>Some 75 different faiths, including Tibetan Buddhism, will be represented by spiritual leaders.</p>
