        <p>So righteous, so brave, so bold. The verdict is in: Al Gore is the best thing to happen to the Jews since Oskar Schindler.</p>
        <p>Such has been the ecstatic cry of the media bloviators once the vice president showed the guts, the courage and, yes (all together now!), the chutzpah to select a Jew -- an Orthodox Jew, yet -- as his running mate. Never mind that Alan Greenspan and Robert Rubin have been far more powerful than any vice president, Jewish or not, will ever be. Never mind that the also-rans on Mr. Gore's uninspiring list of potential running mates were of unambiguously lesser caliber than Joseph Lieberman.</p>

        <p>So righteous, so brave, so bold. The verdict is in: Al Gore is the best thing to happen to the Jews since Oskar Schindler.</p>
        <p>Such has been the ecstatic cry of the media bloviators once the vice president showed the guts, the courage and, yes (all together now!), the chutzpah to select a Jew -- an Orthodox Jew, yet -- as his running mate. Never mind that Alan Greenspan and Robert Rubin have been far more powerful than any vice president, Jewish or not, will ever be. Never mind that the also-rans on Mr. Gore's uninspiring list of potential running mates were of unambiguously lesser caliber than Joseph Lieberman.</p>
        <p>No matter. For a political press desperate for a new story line, here it is: The Republicans may have Charlton Heston, but in the newly daring Mr. Gore the Democrats at last have their own Moses, who just might lead them to the Promised Land in November after all. According to one account, a presidential candidate considered ''dull, cautious and incapable of stirring emotional loyalty even among his own supporters'' has with this surprise pick jump-started his idling campaign. (Actually, the quote comes from The Times in July 1984, after Walter Mondale anointed Geraldine Ferraro, but it can stand for the collective wisdom of August 2000.)</p>
        <p>Yes, Mr. Gore made his choice in defiance of lethal anti-Jewish bigots on the American fringe, from Sacramento to Crown Heights to cyberspace. And yes, polls say that 12 percent of the country is still anti-Semitic. But doesn't Pat Buchanan have those votes sewed up anyway?</p>
        <p>I defer to a recent Hebrew school grad in my household, 16-year-old Simon: ''Gore gets to prove himself risky by doing something completely unrisky -- picking a middle-of-the-road candidate like himself.'' His opinion was echoed by another Jew I canvassed, Woody Allen, who finds the fact that ''people are knocked out of their chairs'' by Mr. Lieberman's nomination ''ridiculous.'' He adds: ''It's an embarrassment for the country that it took to the year 2000'' for a Jew to be on the ticket. ''Everyone is saying how tolerant the country is -- they settle for so little!''</p>
        <p>If anything, all the self-congratulatory talk this week about the tolerance of Jews is more unsettling than cheering, once it becomes clear how little many non-Jews know about us. The constant refrain -- ''Could a Jewish vice president wage war on his Sabbath?'' -- has never been asked so vociferously of devout Christians who might have to leave church if bombs dropped on a Sunday. ''I go to an Orthodox synagogue, and do you know how many beepers go off?'' says a laughing Abraham Foxman of B'nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation League, noting all the Jewish doctors who, apparently unbeknownst to most Americans, actually do whip off their prayer shawls when called upon to save lives.</p>
        <p>Conservative Republicans, meanwhile, seem to think that one size yarmulke fits all -- that all Orthodox Jews, Mr. Lieberman included, can be patronizingly stereotyped as cultural reactionaries with views closer to Jerry Falwell's than Mr. Gore's. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Peggy Noonan celebrated Mr. Lieberman as a blood brother to such right-wing Orthodox Jews as Dr. Laura Schlessinger. Yet the Connecticut senator shares few of the views of the anti-gay, pro-life Dr. Laura (or others named by Ms. Noonan) and is in fact to the left of the Clinton-Gore administration on ''don't ask, don't tell,'' which he feels should be scrapped so that gays can serve openly in the military. Mr. Lieberman's cultural conservatism mainly consists of throwing occasional self-promotional press conferences with William Bennett to rail impotently against Jerry Springer.</p>
        <p>The beauty of the Lieberman nomination for Democrats is that it calls the Republicans' bluff on their new ''inclusiveness.'' George W. Bush may have put minorities onstage in Philadelphia, but Mr. Gore put one on the ticket. Better still for the Democrats, compassionate conservatism has such a strict code of political correctness that the Bush forces, already criticized by Jewish groups for the governor's official declaration of a ''Jesus Day'' in Texas this year, will never dare pick on a Jewish candidate. When Mr. Lieberman eloquently defended a woman's right to choose a so-called partial birth abortion on ''Larry King Live'' this week, you didn't hear any of the usual Republican cries of ''infanticide.'' Instead the G.O.P. tried to argue that Mr. Lieberman, who had a 95 percent voting record with the liberal Americans for Democratic Action last year, was a closet Republican. Now that's chutzpah.</p>
        <p>But just as the press gives Mr. Gore excessively high marks for doing the politically expedient thing in picking Mr. Lieberman, so it oversells Mr. Lieberman's value to Mr. Gore. The conventional media wisdom that the first Democratic senator to moralize against Monicagate will now inoculate Mr. Gore from Clinton fatigue and Clinton sleaze is beside the point, even if it were true.</p>
        <p>''We're not choosing a preacher, we're choosing a president,'' said Mr. Gore in 1988, when deflecting Jesse Jackson in the primaries. Despite the biblical pandering by both tickets this year, the same still holds. If puritanical preaching against Bill Clinton's sins is such a sure winner, why did the Bush campaign lock Henry Hyde in an attic in Philadelphia last week? Why, at the height of G.O.P. moralizing against Monicagate in 1998, did the Democrats gain seats in the election? The same Washington geniuses who predicted -- with stunning unanimity and inaccuracy -- that voters would punish Mr. Clinton's party in '98 predict the same fate for Mr. Gore this year. And they're probably wrong again. Now, as then, voters dislike sanctimonious public scolds, regardless of faith or party, as much as they dislike public scoundrels. Now, as then, they know when Mr. Clinton is on the ballot and when he is not, and don't regard all Democrats as his surrogates.</p>
        <p>The real problem for Mr. Gore this year isn't Clinton fatigue -- it's Gore fatigue. And you feel it almost every time he opens his mouth. Whether in small groups or large, on the record or off, the hyper-cautious vice president has trouble speaking plainly and candidly when trying to further his views or his candidacy. Most Americans recognize that he is both far more experienced in and knowledgeable about government than Governor Bush. Few confuse his private life with Bill Clinton's. Polls show that Americans agree with Mr. Gore's positions on most issues and love the economy. But it all may be for naught for a candidate who not only tells you how to build a watch when you ask what time it is but is still talking after you've nodded off.</p>
        <p>A classic example was Mr. Gore's appearance on ''Meet the Press'' last month. Asked by Tim Russert for his visceral reaction to the photo of Elian Gonzalez at gunpoint, the vice president fudged (''I wasn't there, I didn't see exactly what happened'') and droned on in the impersonal legalese of Michael Dukakis's legendary debate flub. Simple requests for his judgments of Ralph Nader and Viktor Chernomyrdin yielded evasions like ''I don't really know him personally'' and ''I have no idea.'' Did Mr. Gore agree with the Supreme Court Boy Scouts decision handed down more than two weeks earlier? ''I haven't read the opinion.'' Worse, each of these non-answers was surrounded by yards of scripted boilerplate, obfuscation or equivocation, occasionally interrupted by attempts (thankfully foiled by Mr. Russert) to introduce charts. It's not good news for Democrats that Mr. Gore is said to be writing his own acceptance speech for next week.</p>
        <p>Joseph Lieberman, himself something of a droning orator and equivocator (including on impeachment), couldn't solve this problem even were he Sammy Davis Jr. The best any vice-presidential candidate can do is no harm. Yet Abraham Foxman says that already some worried Jews are calling the Anti-Defamation League with ''what if'' questions, as in, ''What if the ticket loses? Will Jews be the scapegoat?''</p>
        <p>I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. If Mr. Gore loses, it's not going to be Mr. Lieberman's fault or Mr. Clinton's fault or some anti-Semitic cabal's fault but Mr. Gore's fault. And Mr. Lieberman will have proven himself the wisest guy on the ticket anyway, by not having given up his day job in the Senate to make the race.</p>
