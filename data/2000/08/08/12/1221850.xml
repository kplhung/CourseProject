        <p>After starting the day in first place, Woody Austin played well enough to stay there.</p>
        <p>Shooting a five-under-par 67 and hoping to end a five-year victory drought, Austin entered the weekend with a two-stroke lead after today's second round of the Buick Open. He was 14 under par for the tournament (63-67, 130), two strokes ahead of Rocco Mediate (12 under par), who shot a 64, and four strokes ahead of Hal Sutton (10 under par, 67-67), who was in third place.</p>

        <p>After starting the day in first place, Woody Austin played well enough to stay there.</p>
        <p>Shooting a five-under-par 67 and hoping to end a five-year victory drought, Austin entered the weekend with a two-stroke lead after today's second round of the Buick Open. He was 14 under par for the tournament (63-67, 130), two strokes ahead of Rocco Mediate (12 under par), who shot a 64, and four strokes ahead of Hal Sutton (10 under par, 67-67), who was in third place.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the enormous crowd that followed Tiger Woods around Warwick Hills Golf &amp; Country Club saw him struggle to his second consecutive 70, leaving him four under par, 10 strokes behind Austin.</p>
        <p>Woods, of course, still believed he could win. But Austin still believed in himself.</p>
        <p>''It was very important for me to play aggressive and not be happy where I was,'' said Austin, who started the day with a two-stroke lead after blistering the course with an opening-round 63. ''My wedge game has been absolutely perfect this week. Every chance I got with a wedge, I hit a really good shot.''</p>
        <p>Austin did not putt as well as he did Thursday, needing 29 putts today compared with just 21 putts in the first round. But Austin's ball-striking remained excellent, in a round that included six birdies and just one bogey. Instead of looking uncomfortable with the lead, Austin looked confident.</p>
        <p>As for Woods, it was clear that he was not as sharp as he intends to be for next week's P.G.A. Championship. Woods drove the ball fairly well, but his approach shots lacked their usual accuracy. For Woods, the goal is to peak next week. But on a course where birdies have been plentiful, Woods still had time to get himself in contention.</p>
        <p>''I've done it before,'' Woods said of his ability to come back, before he headed to the practice range. ''I'm hitting the ball well, just not as well as I'd like to.''</p>
        <p>It would be difficult for Austin to play any better. His only victory on the PGA Tour came at the 1995 Buick Open. Currently 108th on the Tour money list, Austin could use a title, or at least a strong finish, to help restore his confidence. After 36 holes, and with his best chance to win in a long time, Austin was eager to see how he would react this weekend.</p>
        <p>''I will probably be shaking in my shoes when I tee it up tomorrow,'' Austin said. ''But if you're nervous and you're playing well, it's easier to overcome. If you're nervous and you're playing like a dog, you're going to play like a dog. I think I will be fine.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>A number of prominent players missed the two-under-par cut, including DAVIS LOVE III (one under par), LEE JANZEN (one over), BOB TWAY (one over), ANDREW MAGEE (one over), JUSTIN LEONARD (two over), DENNIS PAULSON (two over), MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ (six over), SHIGEKI MARUYAMA (six over), STEWART CINK (seven over), and JOSE MARIA OLAZABAL (nine over). . . . Count TIGER WOODS among those players who find it curious that the PGA of America decided to hold this year's P.G.A. Championship at Valhalla Golf &amp; Country Club in Louisville, Ky. ''We've played the other three majors in the year 2000 at three very historic sites -- Augusta, Pebble Beach and St. Andrews,'' Woods said. ''If we were going somewhere like Baltusrol, or somewhere more historic, it would be a better fit.'' Baltusrol, in northern New Jersey, has played host to seven United States Opens.</p>
