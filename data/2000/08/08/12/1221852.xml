        <p>Much has now been written about how the selection of Joseph Lieberman as a vice presidential candidate breaks the last taboo and shows how we Jews are now full members of the American mainstream. To me, it has proved something quite different: just how vulnerable and insecure we remain. And, depending on how things play out in November, it may show how insecure and vigilant we still should be.</p>
        <p>Take the initial reaction to the news. Jews everywhere were instantly on their telephones, friends calling friends, parents calling children, children calling parents, all prompted by the same reactions: joy, yes, but also disbelief. We had been assuming that Mr. Lieberman was, like another member of Mr. Gore's ''short list,'' Gov. Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire, mere window dressing to humor a key Democratic constituency. Even younger Jews had accepted that a Jew on a national political ticket was something they would never see. Our amazement at finding we had been wrong was a reminder -- a surprising, telling reminder -- that for all of our successes, we still felt like outsiders.</p>

        <p>Much has now been written about how the selection of Joseph Lieberman as a vice presidential candidate breaks the last taboo and shows how we Jews are now full members of the American mainstream. To me, it has proved something quite different: just how vulnerable and insecure we remain. And, depending on how things play out in November, it may show how insecure and vigilant we still should be.</p>
        <p>Take the initial reaction to the news. Jews everywhere were instantly on their telephones, friends calling friends, parents calling children, children calling parents, all prompted by the same reactions: joy, yes, but also disbelief. We had been assuming that Mr. Lieberman was, like another member of Mr. Gore's ''short list,'' Gov. Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire, mere window dressing to humor a key Democratic constituency. Even younger Jews had accepted that a Jew on a national political ticket was something they would never see. Our amazement at finding we had been wrong was a reminder -- a surprising, telling reminder -- that for all of our successes, we still felt like outsiders.</p>
        <p>The first incredulity was quickly followed by two equally revealing phenomena: an almost servile gratitude and a kind of tribal, uncritical chauvinism. Many American Jews find Mr. Lieberman vaguely discomfiting. We squirm at his conspicuous religiosity, his constant references to God, which sound so, well, Christian to less observant Jews. Besides, any friend of William Bennett and Jerry Falwell is not a friend of ours (though of course the very public piety we find so distasteful in them we are suddenly willing to accept from Mr. Lieberman). But given our own deep-seated, atavistic insecurity, we are willing to overlook these differences. Long ago, a much more politically primitive and powerless Jewish community loudly applauded when both the famously progressive Louis D. Brandeis and the more conservative Felix Frankfurter joined the Supreme Court; philosophy mattered less than raw ethnic identity and pride. The reaction to Mr. Lieberman suggests that things have not really changed that much.</p>
        <p>Along with what Jews think of themselves, there is the matter of what others think of us.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, spoke of her mother's time in Auschwitz and Dachau and her father's experiences in a Nazi labor camp, a large part of me choked up with pride. In one generation, we have emerged from unspeakable degradation and approached the threshold of the White House. But the old fears die hard; at the same time, I couldn't help but wonder whether other Americans really wanted to hear what she was saying. How many were thinking, ''Enough already with the Holocaust,'' or even something worse?</p>
        <p>Tolerance is in; both parties talk endlessly of ''inclusion.'' But American tolerance is about to be put to a  momentous political test. I'm worried less about the white supremacists whose anti-Semitic rhetoric now fills the chat rooms. They probably don't vote in any case, or don't vote Democratic, or don't vote in the crucial swing states. I'm thinking of the apparently reasonable, upstanding, ostensibly open-minded and tolerant men and women who, in the privacy of the voting booth might suddenly realize they can't abide a Jew just a heartbeat away from the presidency.</p>
        <p>America has been good to the Jews. But more than ever before, Jews are about to learn just how high America's beautiful and spacious skies really reach, and we may not like what we learn. The selection of Mr. Lieberman is not only a moment of triumph for American Jews. It is also a moment of truth.</p>
