        <p>Kendall Gill was in Los Angeles, ready to sign with the Lakers, when he entertained dozens of advice-filled phone calls. Shaquille O'Neal was a frequent recruiter, but ultimately, Gill listened to the man in charge.</p>
        <p>Lewis Katz, the principal owner of the Nets, placed an emergency call to Gill, determined to change his mind. Katz got Gill to doubt his decision to sign with the Lakers for a $4.75 million pay cut and a promise of a championship. By Wednesday night, Katz had convinced Gill to take the $7 million windfall waiting for him in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''If it wasn't for Lewis,'' Gill said, ''I wouldn't be talking with you now. He was the one who persuaded me to come back. My mind was made up.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Gill, 32, was at the Champion Center yesterday re-signing with the Nets for one year. ''In the end, my ego was telling me championship, but I'm the one that has always made sound business decisions,'' said Gill, who will be the starting shooting guard the Nets desperately need now that Kerry Kittles may miss the season following knee surgery.</p>
        <p>''This was just too good of an opportunity for me to pass up. After my conversations, I checked my ego, and after that, it was a no-brainer.''</p>
        <p>Katz had already authorized the Nets to increase their original offer from $4 million to $7 million and had had some heart-to-heart talks with Gill before he turned down the Nets' final offer last Friday.</p>
        <p>Even as Gill went to Los Angeles, though, he said he was still ''sitting around,'' hoping the Nets could pull of a sign-and-trade deal, which would make him a Laker for more than the $2.25 million salary cap exception they could pay him. But Rod Thorn, the Nets' president, exhausted trade possibilities with the Lakers, and Gill realized he could either take the pay cut -- he made $5.6 million with the Nets last season -- to play with the defending champions of the National Basketball Association or take the $7 million to stay with the Nets.</p>
        <p>''If a sign and trade wouldn't work out, Lewis just didn't want me to take the exception when so much money was on the table,'' Gill said. ''He said he wanted me on the team.''</p>
        <p>Katz was trying to reassure Gill, who was said to feel slighted when the Nets pursued free-agent shooting guards like Ron Mercer and Jon Barry. Gill laughed, pleased with his deal. ''When they give you that much money, of course you feel wanted,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Gill said he was virtually locked in as a Laker. ''When a championship team calls and they want you and especially when it's Los Angeles, it was not a very easy decision to make,'' Gill said, feeling the need to add that the Nets were not a ''dog team'' and that they would make progress next season with Kenyon Martin, the first overall pick in the draft.</p>
        <p>Thorn said the team would most likely sign Martin next week, after Martin returned from his honeymoon. He is expected to sign for the rookie maximum of $11.4 million for three years. Thorn was relieved to have Gill signed. It was the team's third transaction in the last week. The Nets came to terms with the veteran Johnny Newman and signed forward Aaron Williams.</p>
        <p>''It was a long and winding road, and it took some different turns, but the end result is that Kendall will be back with us,'' Thorn said.</p>
        <p>Gill averaged 13.1 points last season primarily playing small forward, but Thorn said Gill would be a better scoring threat at shooting guard, his natural position.</p>
