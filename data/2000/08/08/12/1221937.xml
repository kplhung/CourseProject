        <p>BRODSKY-Edward, 70. Beloved husband of Cynthia. Cherished father of Peter and Leslie, William and Karen and James. Darling grandfather of Noah and Skye. Brother of Phillip and Harriet Brodsky. Funeral service will be held on Sunday, August 13 at 1:15PM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue at 76 Street. Contributions in his memory may be made to The Leukemia Research Fund, Long Island Jewish Center, New Hyde Park, New York 11040, attn: Dr. Kanti Rai.</p>
        <p>BRODSKY-Edward. The partners, senior counsel, associates and staff of Proskauer Rose LLP mourn the loss of our beloved senior partner following a courageous six-year battle against chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ed was a distinguished member of our Litigation and Dispute Resolution Department, whose incomparable skills and dedication served our profession for over forty years. His quiet, reflective manner gained him easy acceptance and belied a dogged tenacity to champion the causes he believed in. A lifelong advocate of the American judicial system, Ed served as President of the American College of Trial Lawyers from 1997 to 1998. He was a noted authority on securities and white collar crime and his works were widely published. Most admirably, Ed was a wonderful colleague, an excellent teacher to and mentor of young lawyers and a trusted friend whose absence will be deeply felt. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Cynthia; sons Peter, Bill and James; daughters-in-law Leslie Gittess and Karen Brodsky; grandchildren Noah and Skye and all his family and friends. Alan S. Jaffe Chairman Proskauer Rose LLP</p>
        <p>BRODSKY-Edward. We mourn the loss of Ed Brodsky, Dear Friend, Distinguished Lawyer and Former Partner in the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Cynthia and their children. The Robert M. Morgenthau Association</p>
