        <p>With less than three months until Election Day, Vice President Al Gore faces a crucial and perplexing question: why does his presidential campaign not seem to be benefiting from an economy that is as good as it gets?</p>
        <p>Heading into the Democratic National Convention next week in Los Angeles, Mr. Gore can point to an array of indicators that would seem to work powerfully to the advantage of the incumbent party in the White House, especially when today's economic conditions are compared with those that the Clinton administration inherited seven and a half years ago.</p>
        <p>Unemployment is down to levels not seen in a generation. Incomes and homeownership are up. Budget deficits have given way to huge surpluses, and the stock market has generated staggering wealth.</p>
        <p>It may be too early to count the economy out as a big factor in Mr. Gore's favor. But so far, prosperity's glow has done little for him.</p>
        <p>Not only has he trailed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in nearly every national poll for months, but his efforts to portray himself as a superior steward of the economy have also fallen flat.</p>
        <p>A New York Times/CBS News Poll last month found that 75 percent of voters said they believed Mr. Gore was likely to keep the economy strong if elected president, compared with 71 percent for Mr. Bush, a statistical dead heat. Asked which candidate would do a better job of managing the economy, respondents in a Business Week/Harris Poll last month favored Mr. Bush by 51 percent to 33 percent.</p>
        <p>''At the moment, the economy is not cutting for Gore as much as I would like,'' said Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of centrist Democrats.</p>
        <p>Political analysts and officials of both parties said Mr. Gore might have hurt himself to a degree by failing to stick to a simple, consistent message about the economy, especially during the spring, when he veered into issues like the Elian Gonzalez case. And they said Mr. Bush had artfully tried to shift the debate from who gets credit for prosperity to what should be done with it.</p>
        <p>But they said the real difficulty for Mr. Gore might be that times had  been good for so long that voters took prosperity for granted.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore's biggest problem on the economy is that this recovery has been going on much longer than any previous recovery,'' said Robert B. Reich, who served as labor secretary in President Clinton's first term. ''It's become almost background noise, and people assume the good economy will just keep on rolling.''</p>
        <p>Not only do voters show little willingness to grant credit to Mr. Gore, analysts said, but the electorate also does not see either candidate as having much control over an economy that seems increasingly driven by technological advances, globalization and other forces beyond the control of any administration.</p>
        <p>''In the economy we're in now, the public doesn't buy the idea that the economy is good because of the Clinton-Gore administration, and they'd be just as disinclined to credit the Republican Congress,'' said Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma who is now a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.</p>
        <p>Still, experience suggests that when Election Day rolls around, a fat and happy electorate is likely to think hard before throwing an incumbent party out of the White House.</p>
        <p>Some analysts -- as well as Mr. Gore's aides -- point to the last time a sitting vice president ran for president with a strong economy at his back -- in 1988, when Governor Bush's father faced Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts. For most of the summer, Mr. Bush was behind despite nearly six years of steady economic expansion and an unemployment rate that had been halved, to 5.4 percent, since 1982.</p>
        <p>A Gallup poll in June 1988 showed Mr. Dukakis ahead by 52 percent to 38 percent, and when asked which candidate would do a better job keeping the country prosperous, voters ranked the candidates evenly at around 40 percent. But by November, Mr. Bush had a 52-to-35 advantage on economic management in the Gallup poll, and he won the election comfortably.</p>
        <p>''History says that people's perceptions of a sitting vice president's capability with regard to the economy can change,'' said Andrew Kohut, a pollster who is director of the Pew Research Center for People and the Press.</p>
        <p>Mark Fabiani, Mr. Gore's deputy campaign manager for communications, said most voters had not yet focused on the election, and that when they did, they would conclude that Mr. Gore had supported and shaped the policies that had brought the economy to where it was and that his approach was more prudent than his rival's.</p>
        <p>And he said Mr. Gore would seek to link Governor Bush's economic plans to those of his father, who presided over a recession that contributed to his defeat in 1992.</p>
        <p>''People in the end will focus on the economy as the most important issue, and in the end will focus on whether we're on the right economic track and whether they are better off than they were four or eight years ago,'' Mr. Fabiani said. ''The answers to those questions are good for Gore and bad for Bush.''</p>
        <p>If anything, Mr. Gore is emphasizing the economy more as the campaign progresses, using a message that has two distinct components.</p>
        <p>One is unabashedly populist, and is aimed in part at the party's liberal base and at people who do not feel that they have fully benefited from the boom. It is built around the assertion -- challenged by Republicans -- that Mr. Bush's economic platform amounts to tax cuts for the wealthy, an overhaul of Social Security that would leave the retirement security of working people at risk and deference to powerful special interests like oil and pharmaceutical companies.</p>
        <p>The other is a promise to continue the policies of fiscal responsibility that helped bring about budget surpluses and reduced interest rates. This portion of his message is intended to emphasize continuity with one of the most successful elements of Mr. Clinton's record and to appeal to moderate swing voters.</p>
