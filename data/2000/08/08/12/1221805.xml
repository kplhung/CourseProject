        <p>Tina Rosenberg is correct. We need to know which ''friends'' spied on us during the Communist era, just as the victims of the Gestapo needed to know. Coming clean is the essential first step on the road to an open and democratic society.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Polish Election Vexed by Communist Spies'' (Editorial Observer, Aug. 11):</p>
        <p>Tina Rosenberg is correct. We need to know which ''friends'' spied on us during the Communist era, just as the victims of the Gestapo needed to know. Coming clean is the essential first step on the road to an open and democratic society.</p>
        <p>I have received 104 copies of reports that were sent to the Hungarian secret police in the 1980's informing on my ''activities in the U.S.A.'' But the names of the informers have been removed.</p>
        <p>As of today, I still do not know which of my friends informed on me. Hungary continues to protect the identities of informers and former party members, some of whom still serve in the government.</p>
        <p>Just imagine what Germany would be like today if Nazi Party members were permitted to sit in the democratic government.</p>
