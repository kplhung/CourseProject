        <p>While many American Jews waxed enthusiastic about the vice-presidential candidacy of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, more than a few have also raised eyebrows at his very public expressions of religious faith and his advocacy of a closer partnership between government and religion.</p>
        <p>American Jews have long been among the strongest supporters of strict separation of church and state. That has not changed, a new study indicates, despite talk of growing Jewish disenchantment with liberalism and growing popularity of Jewish religious schools.</p>
        <p>But the study also shows the complexity of Jewish views, including large gaps between those of the Jewish public and Jewish leadership, and that Jewish leaders appear simultaneously to insist on strict separation of church and state and to defend the involvement of organized religion in political affairs.</p>
        <p>Jewish strict separationism dates only from the 20th century. Before that, Jews were generally willing to work within the prevailing assumption that government should be supportive of religion, rather than neutral toward it. Jews simply demanded that Judaism receive the same benevolence and privileges as Christianity.</p>
        <p>Jewish attitudes changed, said Jonathan Sarna, professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis University, when prominent Christian churchmen (perhaps feeling their world imperiled by mass immigration, industrialization and urbanization) began campaigning to have the United States explicitly declared a Christian nation. Jews reacted by allying themselves with nonreligious secularists in a struggle to make public schools and other government undertakings religiously neutral.</p>
        <p>This background is mentioned in a new survey conducted for the Center for Jewish Community Studies in Philadelphia. It is part of a larger research project on ''Jews and the American Public Square,'' which in turn is part of a cluster of studies financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts of major religious groups and American civic life.</p>
        <p>Seeking to detect any recent changes in Jewish views on church and state, the survey compared three groups: a representative sample of American Jews, a representative sample of non-Jewish Americans that mirrored the Jewish sample in educational level and geographic distribution, and a sample of Jewish leaders taken from participants in the annual conference of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, a prominent communal defense agency.</p>
        <p>Regarding issues like religion in public schools, government aid or vouchers for religious schools, and the display of Christmas mangers or Hanukkah candles on government property, the study found that American Jews remain firmly separationist. And their leaders are even more so.</p>
        <p>For example, 59 percent of the non-Jewish Americans in the study favored allowing nondenominational prayers to be read in public school classrooms. By contrast, only 20 percent of the Jewish public favored allowing such prayers, and for Jewish leaders, the figure dropped to 2 percent.</p>
        <p>The Jewish leaders' even stricter separationism cannot be attributed to secularity. On virtually every measure of religiosity or involvement in organized Jewish life, the leaders outscored the general Jewish public. They light Sabbath candles, fast on Yom Kippur, attend synagogues, visit Israel, pursue Jewish education and attest to the importance of Judaism in their lives at significantly higher rates.</p>
        <p>At one fascinating point in the survey, this pattern suddenly shifts into reverse. Asked whether ''belonging to a church or synagogue makes one a more aware and engaged citizen,'' the Jewish leaders are more apt to say yes than the Jewish public and virtually as likely as the parallel sample of non-Jews.</p>
        <p>Asked whether the clergy can discuss political candidates or issues from the pulpit, twice as many Jewish leaders as members of the Jewish public say yes (73 percent to 35 percent), and more Jews say yes than do their non-Jewish counterparts (35 percent to 30 percent). Half of the Jewish leaders defended the anti-abortion movement's right to use religion in making its case, whereas 42 percent of the non-Jewish counterparts did and 15 percent of the Jewish public.</p>
        <p>On the statement, ''Churches and synagogues should keep out of political matters,'' 44 percent of the Jewish public agreed, as did 36 percent of the non-Jewish counterparts; only 14 percent of the Jewish leaders did.</p>
        <p>The survey presents an overall ''index of support for church involvement in politics,'' giving the non-Jewish counterparts a ranking of 49 percent, the Jewish public 46 percent, and the Jewish leaders 80 percent.</p>
        <p>Explanations for this combination of strict separationism with a defense of religious involvement in politics are not hard to come by. Jewish leaders' commitment to freedom of speech or religion would suffice, and then there is plain self-interest. To some extent, they are simply defending their own role in public policy debates.</p>
        <p>Still, the survey reveals some curious anomalies. Fewer than 1 of every 5 Jewish leaders agrees that ''democracy in the U.S. works better if Americans are religious,'' and scarcely more than 1 of 10 rank-and-file Jews agrees. Only 20 percent of the leaders agree that ''the influence of religion in American life should increase,'' and only 30 percent of the Jewish public do.</p>
        <p>Stephen M. Cohen of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, who designed the survey, offers an interpretation. Jewish leaders, Mr. Cohen said, ''are, indeed, more committed than the Jewish public to the right of religious institutions and leaders to engage in public life and discourse,'' but, like the Jewish public, the ''leaders are unhappy with the actual exercise of that right.''</p>
        <p>One suspects that the explanation is not so logical, that in-depth interviews would show different phrases conjuring up different images in the minds of the survey's respondents. When asked whether ''I am pleased when political leaders publicly affirm their belief in God,'' Jews are far more likely to think of a Christian political leader than, say, Senator Lieberman.</p>
        <p>No wonder that only 22 percent of the Jewish leaders and 30 percent of the Jewish public said yes to that question, compared with 70 percent of the non-Jewish counterparts.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this survey should be replicated after a few months of campaigning by Senator Lieberman.</p>
