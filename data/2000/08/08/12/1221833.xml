        <p>The United States and Argentina have temporarily halted trade in Argentine beef because of concerns of a possible outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease here.</p>
        <p>In statements today, the two governments called the step precautionary and said the disease did not pose a long-term threat to the growing trade in one of Argentina's most popular exports.

        <p>The United States and Argentina have temporarily halted trade in Argentine beef because of concerns of a possible outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease here.</p>
        <p>In statements today, the two governments called the step precautionary and said the disease did not pose a long-term threat to the growing trade in one of Argentina's most popular exports. Nevertheless, the halt in shipments is more bad news for President Fernando de la Rua in his lagging efforts to pry Argentina out of a two-year recession.</p>
        <p>Argentina's quota of beef sales to the United States is 20,000 tons a year and it is lobbying hard to increase the quota. The United States refused fresh Argentine beef until 1997, when the Agriculture Department lifted a ban linked to recurrent outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the early part of the century.</p>
        <p>Argentine beef has become a gastronomic fashion in much of the United States. Fed on grass rather than corn and allowed to roam on the pampas, Argentine cattle produce beef that is lean and tasty, if slightly chewy.</p>
        <p>Nine days ago, Argentine officials found antibodies for foot-and-mouth disease in 10 head of cattle smuggled from neighboring Paraguay. Foot-and-mouth, rarely suffered by humans although they can be carriers, is a virus characterized by fever, weight loss and mouth blisters. As a precaution, the Argentine government ordered the slaughter of 3,000 head of cattle in northern Formosa, Corrientes and Entre Rios Provinces and suspended most exports of fresh beef, not only to the United States, but also to Canada, Venezuela, Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>The government said the cattle with the antibodies were not actually sick.</p>
        <p>After Argentina took action, the United States Department of Agriculture put a ''temporary hold'' on fresh, chilled or frozen Argentine beef. Cooked and canned beef imports will still be allowed in.</p>
        <p>Agriculture Secretary Antonio Berhongaray said today that his government took Washington's action in stride. ''There is no inclination on the part of the United States to prohibit the import of Argentine beef,'' Mr. Berhongaray said. ''This was a move that was anticipated.''</p>
        <p>In a brief statement today, the American Embassy praised Argentina for taking prompt action. ''As soon as this situation is resolved,'' the statement read, ''exports of fresh beef will be able to resume.''</p>
        <p>As the fourth largest beef exporter, Argentina expected to sell 350,000 tons of beef products abroad this year. Three months ago, international monitors declared Argentine beef free of foot-and-mouth disease, a finding that officials had hoped would help them increase exports.</p>
        <p>''Argentina made the decision to cease meat exports until the sanitary situation is resolved,'' the Argentine Agriculture Department said in a statement that predicted a resolution of the problem in a week.</p>
