        <p>A man who suffered head injuries on Thursday in an assault in his Upper West Side apartment may have been attacked by the same person responsible for break-ins at seven other residences in the area, including several incidents that ended in violence, the police said.</p>
        <p>The most recent attack, the first to take place during the day, sent ripples of alarm throughout the neighborhood. ''It's not supposed to happen here,'' one resident said.</p>
        <p>The injured man, Jack Kravitz, was discovered unconscious at 6:51 p.m. by his wife when she entered their apartment at 130 West 81st Street, near Amsterdam Avenue, a police official said. The wife, whose name the police would not release, found blood on the floor when she walked into the foyer, the official said. Then she walked up to the second level, where she found her husband on the floor.</p>
        <p>He had suffered cuts and a fractured skull in the beating, the police said. There were no signs of forced entry, the police said, and it was unclear whether anything had been taken from the apartment, which is in a four-story walk-up building on a quiet, tree-lined street. A glass door leads to a tiled lobby that is staffed by a security guard. The police said that nobody in the building saw anything out of the ordinary.</p>
        <p>The incident was the latest in what appeared to be a series of increasingly break-ins with violence in neighborhoods on the Upper West Side. In an incident on July 28, a man and a woman were beaten with a flashlight; the woman was critically injured. Four days earlier, an elderly couple had been beaten and stabbed.</p>
        <p>''The assault is included in the pattern,'' said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman, of the latest attack. ''There's no description on the suspect or suspects. That's where the problem lies.''</p>
        <p>One police official said he did not know whether Mr. Kravitz could give a clear description of his attacker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kravitz was treated for injuries to his face and head at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He was listed in stable condition last night, a hospital administrator said.</p>
        <p>The attack brought sobering fears to people who live in the Kravitzes' immediate neighborhood. The couple live on a block lined with flower shops, bakeries and clothing stores.</p>
        <p>Cheryl Rhodes, a teacher at a private school in Manhattan who moved from the Lower East Side to the building next door to the Kravitzes', said she was alarmed by the string of crimes.</p>
        <p>''We moved here to get away from stuff like this,'' she said. ''It's scary to think that something like this would happen.''</p>
        <p>Bette Nakamura, a lawyer who lives a block away, said that for weeks she had been afraid of leaving her two teenage sons alone at home during the day while she worked.</p>
        <p>''My boys are big, but I don't think the burglars will care,'' she said. ''All the burglaries have been so vicious that I think they'll just come in and rob us anyway.''</p>
        <p>In the incident on July 28, on West 87th Street, only a pocketbook was taken from the home, and the police were not sure how the robber entered the apartment. As in Thursday's incident, there were no signs of forced entry. In the attack on July 24, on West 93rd Street near Central Park West, the intruder awakened the couple during his pillaging. He fled with $500.</p>
        <p>After the attack on July 28, the police began looking into break-ins in the 24th Precinct, which covers much of the Upper West Side from 86th Street to Cathedral Parkway. They found five others since June 25 that had taken place in the early morning at first-floor or basement-level apartments between West 87th Street and West 105th Street. Five were near Riverside Drive and two were near Central Park West.</p>
        <p>One man in the Kravitzes' building said that he had lived in the area for more than 12 years, but that he had never felt unsafe until now.</p>
        <p>''It's crazy,'' said the man, who would not give his name. ''I heard about it this morning, and I just locked my door. It's a little unnerving to think that someone can just come into your home in the middle of the day. If it can happen to Jack, then it can happen to anyone.''</p>
