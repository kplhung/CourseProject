        <p>A long, long time ago, before the triangle below Canal Street became TriBeCa and when a coffee house was something very different from Starbucks, young men and women in black turtlenecks and berets used to gather in downtown basements and bars to smoke foul cigarettes and listen to jazz and poetry, some bad and some not so bad, and see experimental plays.

        <p>In a raw and raucous production of Bertolt Brecht's ''Baal,'' Jim Simpson and his fledgling Bat Theater Company recapture the spirit and excitement of that old after-hours avant-garde.

        <p>A long, long time ago, before the triangle below Canal Street became TriBeCa and when a coffee house was something very different from Starbucks, young men and women in black turtlenecks and berets used to gather in downtown basements and bars to smoke foul cigarettes and listen to jazz and poetry, some bad and some not so bad, and see experimental plays. It was the milieu that produced, for better or worse, the Beat generation, progressive jazz and later, Sam Shepard.</p>
        <p>In a raw and raucous production of Bertolt Brecht's ''Baal,'' Jim Simpson and his fledgling Bat Theater Company recapture the spirit and excitement of that old after-hours avant-garde. Performed in the downstairs space of the Flea Theater on a bare, black box of a set, with a jazz trio on the side and a 10 p.m. starting time, the show rekindles a sense of adventure that is too often missing in today's theater. The Beats go on. Well, except for the no smoking signs.</p>
        <p>''Baal'' was Brecht's first play (although not the first produced), and it is infused with all the youthful passion and anger of a beginning playwright. With a title character named for the biblical idol synonymous with evil (whose cult practiced ceremonial fornication and child sacrifice), Brecht deliberately set out to shock his audiences. And if the theater is still capable of shocking audiences (as opposed to disgusting them), Mr. Simpson and his energetic cast provide the electricity in their updated version of this story of a dissolute poet who cares about nothing except satisfying his carnal desires.</p>
        <p>Brecht wrote ''Baal'' in 1919, the year after the armistice ended World War I and the future playwright's military service as a medical orderly. Scholars have called the play an early example of the nihilistic Expressionism that appears in Brecht's later work. In program notes for the Bat production, Mr. Simpson says it was written as a counter to a popular play of the time in Germany that depicted a gentle poet who enriched the lives of all who came to know him. Brecht's Baal is quite the other thing: a violent poet whose appetites are insatiable and who corrupts everyone who comes in contact with him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simpson has moved the play from Berlin to New York City in the late 1940's, the dawn of the Beats. There are strong parallels between the two venues: people struggling with conflicting postwar feelings of guilt, disenchantment and hope while angry, iconoclastic youth sets out to change the world.</p>
        <p>Brecht's Baal is an amoral poet whose creed is stated in an opening tableau: ''Take what you can get/and when you've got it all/ move on to greener pastures.'' The action then follows Baal's path from dissipation to depravity to despair. In 21 brief scenes, Baal makes his way through ''bars and churches and other dens of sleaze'' in a story of seduction that runs from a wealthy publisher's uptown apartment to the Lo-Life bar downtown to the poet's First Avenue pad to points west.</p>
        <p>Peter Mellencamp's new translation pulls no punches in its explicit language and makes no concessions in Baal's misogynist view of the women he uses and abuses. The poetry reflects the romantic passion that only youth can summon and at times sounds like that of the Beats. (''Trees look like/ rotting teeth/in the mouth of the sky'' or ''That shack over there/it will soon be a house/then a factory/ cities devouring trees,'' that sort of thing.)</p>
        <p>As director, Mr. Simpson has put together a rough-and-tumble production that races along for its 100 minutes and is Brechtian down to Clayton Binkley's minimal sets and Ben Struck's effective lighting. Brecht believed it unnecessary, even undesirable, to try to conceal the stage's illumination or to use more furniture than absolutely necessary. In the Bat's ''Baal,'' the actors bring on what props or lights they need for each scene. Nothing is hidden, certainly not emotions.</p>
        <p>A cast of 14 actors play more than 30 roles, and there's really not a weak performance among them. Michael J. X. Gladis delivers a small tour de force as Baal, giving the character a rakish charm that is all the more credible for his restraint in portraying him as evil. Andrew Led yard gives a subtle and mysterious reading of Ekhart, Baal's companion and nemesis. In the all-around solid cast, some especially noteworthy actors include Gordon Holmes as an end-of-the-world religious fanatic and wino; Tamar Schoenberg as a bar waitress; Leah Smith as Johanna, a virgin who drowns herself after being seduced by Baal and then returns to haunt him; and Joanie Ellen as the announcer.</p>
        <p>The mood of the show, however, is set and maintained by the excellent jazz trio that plays at the top and throughout the performance. It is led by William Connell Jr. on alto sax, clarinet and flute, with Jeremy Blynn on drums and Ian Riggs on bass. The trio's steady background of bebop and progressive evokes not only the tone of the play but also the essence of the time in which it is set. These are real cool cats, and they help turn ''Baal'' into a daring evening of theater. The only thing missing is some real espresso. And, of course, the Gauloises.</p>
