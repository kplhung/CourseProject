        <p>IN the midst of preparing for the opening game in a series against the Mets -- tickets to get, coaches to coordinate for a meeting -- Dusty Baker paused yesterday at Shea Stadium to contemplate a question about his second passion, music.</p>
        <p>The Giants' 51-year-old manager was asked to consider a hypothetical scenario: he was exiled to a deserted island and could only take five compact discs.</p>
        <p>''I'd take Tupac, the double set. I'd take George Clinton; I'd bring John Lee Hooker; I'd bring Santana and I'd have to bring something by George Howard,'' he said. ''Sometimes you need to be up, sometimes you need to be angry. Sometimes you need to be mellow, sometimes you need to enjoy. Sometimes you just need to be entertained.''</p>
        <p>Baker's explanation of his musical taste captures the secret to his success as a manager and underlines why has he has been able to stay in one place for eight seasons. The Giants lost to the Mets, 4-1. But Baker's world is all about sound, and this loss was merely one sour note with thousands left to play.</p>
        <p>''We've still got three more here,'' Baker said with typical optimism.</p>
        <p>Baker became the Giants manager in 1993. Only Minnesota's Tom Kelly, Atlanta's Bobby Cox and Montreal's Felipe Alou have been at their current jobs longer. ''There were a couple times I knew I was on the hot seat, but seems like my teams would always win when I was on the hot seat,'' Baker said.</p>
        <p>What is the source of his longevity?</p>
        <p>''I'd say it was God,'' Baker said. ''It wasn't us, it wasn't me, it wasn't them. It was God.''</p>
        <p>Baker conceded other factors were involved. Baker, who was born in Southern California, has settled into the Bay Area. ''I live in the community and I'm big in the community, too,'' he said. ''You have more people who know you personally. That puts pressure on the organization not to get rid of you quicker, too. If you're not big in the community and you don't have any community people saying, 'Hey don't do this, don't do that,' people have freer rein to do what they want to do and nothing's said.</p>
        <p>''It helps that San Francisco is a more liberated town,'' Baker continued. ''The mayor is African-American, you have black civic leaders, a powerful black clergy that's also big in the community.''</p>
        <p>There's a certain uplifting spirit that Baker brings to the game. Players feel it; most like it. Darryl Hamilton played for Baker in 1997 and 1998. ''You knew that he was the guy in charge,'' Hamilton said of Baker. ''Then again, you didn't. He kind of came to you like another player. All the guys who played for him respected him because of that.</p>
        <p>''He'd always be talking to the hitters about hitting,'' Hamilton said. ''I'd be like, 'Dusty, come on, man, you can't hit anymore.' He'd grab a bat and go out and hit. Most managers aren't like that. They're not as easy to talk to.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, Baker has an unyielding bottom line that you cross at your peril. He uses it to distinguish between outer and inner dignity. ''Sometimes the outer dignity is stuff like our parents had to learn that we didn't have to do,'' he said. ''You've got a wife, kids, responsibility. So you take certain things for now, in order to survive. But when it gets too personal, at that point, damn the job, damn everybody because now you have penetrated my inner core, my inner dignity, which no man has the right to intrude upon.''</p>
        <p>The Giants are treading perilously close to Baker's inner dignity. Baker, one of only six managers to be voted Manager of the Year twice -- in 1993 and '97 -- is a hot commodity. The Giants seem to be playing loose and easy with Baker. They have a new stadium and a solid team. Life is good. Maybe the franchise has deluded itself -- as owners often do -- into thinking the front office is the source of the team's success and that it can get just about any skipper to direct the ship.</p>
        <p>Baker is not making an issue of the fact that he is in the final year of his contract. That's an offshoot from something else his father taught him. ''You've got to pick your battles,'' he said. ''Sometimes you've got to say, 'I'll take it now but I'm going to get you later.' ''</p>
        <p>In the best-case scenario, Baker would lead the Giants to the World Series, then ride off, perhaps with his music to that deserted island.</p>
        <p>''Right now I'm trying not to distract my team,'' Baker said. ''I told the team: 'Who knows where anybody's going to be next year, or tomorrow, for that matter? Tomorrow is not promised to anybody. Let's go out, work hard, play hard, have a good time and make this the most memorable year of your career. Let's go out and make this a miracle year.' ''</p>
