        <p>It could have been one of those minor triumphs that make a phone rep's day: Dawn Barbour, a customer service agent for Verizon -- then Bell Atlantic  -- had just made an angry customer stop ranting, solved his problem and even elicited a kind word.</p>
        <p>''I hate Bell Atlantic, but you're the nicest rep I ever had,'' the caller said.</p>
        <p>A simple ''thank you'' seemed the right reply, but Ms. Barbour had to follow a script.</p>
        <p>''Did I provide you with outstanding service today?'' she inquired.</p>
        <p>''Isn't that what I just said?'' barked the customer, steaming right back up again.</p>
        <p>''I felt like a total idiot,'' Ms. Barbour said. But Verizon requires customer service agents to ask the ''outstanding service'' question at the end of every call, she said, and if she had dropped it, a supervisor listening in could have deducted points from her performance score. Low points reduce the chance of a promotion, she said.</p>
        <p>Complaints of being made to feel like an idiot are hardly the stuff that brought organized labor to the barricades in the past. The famous labor struggles of American history call to mind collapsing mineshafts and machine gunners posted on factory roofs, not mandatory telephone sign-offs recited in attractive, air-conditioned offices. For decades, contract negotiations have centered on wages and benefits, not the subtler question of whether relatively well-paid workers can have a greater say over the nature of their work.</p>
        <p>Yet Verizon's customer service representatives say that even in their comfortable, well-lighted call centers, stress has become an issue to strike over. New technology means customer calls now roll in assembly-line style, they say. Fast business growth means frequent mandatory overtime, disrupting family schedules. Today's heightened focus on earnings growth requires customer service representatives to pitch products to all callers, even those who do not want to buy anything.</p>
        <p>Customers sometimes become angry and abusive, but the representatives cannot slam down the phone, hide in the bathroom or do much else except follow the script, since their supervisors may be listening in and rating them.</p>
        <p>''We have the pressure of always being nice,'' said Linda Kramer, a customer service representative in Cranford, N.J., and president of the local arm of the Communications Workers of America.</p>
        <p>Novel though it is for stress to be an issue in a strike, some observers think the Verizon workers may be making the complaint at a time of heightened public receptivity. Many Americans can understand complaints about work spilling over into family time. And recent studies suggest that ''emotional labor'' -- acting friendly when you're seething inside -- can actually weaken one's immunity and overload the cardiovascular and nervous systems.</p>
        <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that nearly half of all recorded occupational stress cases occur among ''technical, sales and administrative support'' workers, the category that includes customer service representatives. And the median length of absence for occupational stress is more than four times that of other workplace injuries and illnesses.</p>
        <p>''This is an important issue, and it will be a growing issue,'' said Paul Osterman, a professor of human resources and management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He said that the number of people in customer service jobs is growing and that complaints about the nature of the work are rising.</p>
        <p>There are about 3.3 million customer service representatives in the United States, only about 7 percent of whom have union representation.</p>
        <p>Verizon executives, while agreeing that customer service is a demanding job, say the stress the strikers describe is really a function of today's fast-paced and highly competitive business environment, not a result of bad management.</p>
        <p>Verizon monitors its customer service representatives and emphasizes sales ''because I want to be sure they provide a high quality of service,'' said Bruce Gordon, president of Verizon's Retail Markets Group. ''That's called quality assurance, and every industry does it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon said Verizon's customer service representatives were told before they were hired that they would be working mandatory overtime and selling products. He added that Verizon's personnel policies were on par with, and in some cases better than, all prevailing industry norms. Verizon says its customer service representatives earn $35,000 to $45,000 a year on average for a job that does not require a college degree, and they get free health insurance.</p>
        <p>The Verizon workers generally work four hours in the morning and four in the afternoon, with an hour off for lunch and two 15-minute breaks. They sit spaced well apart in ergonomically designed cubicles, typing orders into computers and speaking into noise-filtering headsets. The employees brighten their workplaces with family photos, Beanie Babies, union posters and the certificates and awards they get for good sales and service.</p>
        <p>All around the calling centers stand easels showing the prizes they can win for big sales, ranging from humble pizzas and candy bars to trips to the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>What causes the stress? Nearby is the supervisor's station, where a computer screen shows every workstation on a color-coded grid.</p>
        <p>The squares change color depending on whether the employees are signed on, signed off, keeping a customer on hold for less than two minutes, keeping someone on hold for more than two minutes, and so on. A supervisor can see at a glance if a representative is taking too long and go investigate.</p>
        <p>Patti Egan, a customer service representative for Verizon and a business agent for the Communications Workers of America, in Jamaica, Queens, said the stress became much worse after Verizon installed a system that automatically routes a call to a representative two seconds after his or her previous call disconnects.</p>
        <p>''There's no downtime,'' Ms. Egan said. ''The customer disconnects, and the next call's right there. Try living like that, taking calls every two seconds.'' The result, she says, is that representatives must often begin dealing with a new caller while still typing up the order of the last caller. Sometimes, she adds, workers set unfinished orders aside and do not find the time to return to them.</p>
        <p>Compounding the pressure, say the strikers, is the need to sell to virtually every caller. Representatives are trained to shift the conversation from, say, a billing inquiry to a sales pitch -- a practice Verizon calls bridging.</p>
        <p>''Imagine if you're calling in because you're getting harassing calls and you want a new phone number,'' Ms. Kramer said. ''The service rep is required to look at your account and see what features you have, and then try to sell you something. And not just one item, that's not good enough. I'm required to offer you voicemail if you don't have it, three-way calling if you don't have it. I'm required to do my best and sparkle and shine, and put you at ease so you say, 'Oh, all right, I'll take it for a month, just because you sound so nice.' ''</p>
        <p>Citing the ongoing negotiations, Mr. Gordon of Verizon declined to discuss the specifc complaints of the workers.</p>
        <p>Strikers say it is not selling that causes stress, but having to do it according to standard scripts and procedures when common sense tells them not to. Many complain of having to dangle deluxe products before people who do not need them.</p>
        <p>''It fights with the inner part of the rep,'' Ms. Egan said. ''She's thinking, 'Look at this poor 80-year-old woman, what does she need three-way calling for?' I'm offering her gadgets and she can't even see the pushbuttons on the phone.''</p>
        <p>But if the workers do not make the offers, a listening supervisor may note the failure. And at least once a month, the supervisors meet with each worker for a feedback session, reviewing monitored calls and discussing how to do better.</p>
        <p>''I've had situations where I sold caller ID, but because I didn't start with the biggest package, the feedback was, 'You should have bridged to Sound Deal Plus,' '' said Ms. Barbour, naming Verizon's biggest residential package. Reps in her center are supposed to sell about $60,000 worth of products each a month if they want to move out of customer service jobs and into a job with no sales duties, she said, a goal she says she can meet.</p>
        <p>But those who cannot meet that goal do poorly on their annual reviews, Ms. Kramer said. ''Let's face it, we're not all car salesmen,'' she said.</p>
