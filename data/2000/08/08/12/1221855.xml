        <p>Leave it to Annika Sorenstam to show up and threaten to spoil Karrie Webb's bid to defend her du Maurier Classic title. Sorenstam, Webb's chief rival at the top level of the L.P.G.A. tour, fired a second consecutive 69 for a one-shot lead after 36 holes at the Royal Ottawa Golf Club.</p>
        <p>Webb, who has won two major titles this year, gained no ground today, shooting an even par 72 and standing at one under par, five shots behind.</p>
        <p>Sorenstam's closest pursuer was the Canadian favorite Lorie Kane, a Prince Edward Island native who became a first-time winner last week in St. Louis. She recorded a five-under-par 67, the low round of the day, leaving her one shot behind Sorenstam at 139.</p>
        <p>Juli Inkster, Laura Philo and the first-round leader, the rookie Diana D'Alessio, were two strokes back. Meg Mallon was three shots behind.</p>
        <p>The du Maurier is the final major of the Ladies Professional Golf Association season. Canadian players have promised all week that this tournament would be a celebration of its 21-year history as a major.</p>
        <p>Canadian government anti-tobacco legislation has banned cigarette advertising for sports and cultural events, affecting the tournament's title sponsor. Unless tournament organizers can come up with a new sponsor, the event is two days away from becoming history.</p>
        <p>Kane arrived home to Canada this week as the country's best hope to win. But even Kane, with six birdies and a bogey today, knows that nationalistic pride goes only so far at a major. Sorenstam crashed Kane's day of red numbers and maple leaf flags to take the lead on the par-72 course. Looking for her first victory at a major since the 1996 United States Women's Open, Sorenstam wasn't distracted by the hoopla.</p>
        <p>''I'm very pleased that I could stay focused for the whole day,'' said Sorenstam, who, like Webb, is seeking her sixth victory of the season. ''Today was a scoring day and I'm glad I took the opportunity to do that.''</p>
        <p>Sorenstam used conservative course management to survive Royal Ottawa's tiny greens and tricky fairways. She hit 16 greens for the day. ''There are pins I just don't go for,'' she said. ''I don't see the strategy in being too aggressive.''</p>
        <p>Webb, the world's top-ranked player, said she ''didn't have a flow going'' to charge up the leader board. Sorenstam was out of reach all day.</p>
        <p>''I haven't shot myself in the foot, but I'd like to be a few more under at this point,'' Webb said.</p>
        <p>It was Kane who predicted that the player to watch would be Inkster. True to form, Inkster, who started the day at even par, carded a 68 that included a 32 on the front nine. She dropped a 10-footer for birdie on the 17th hole, trimming Sorenstam's lead to a single stroke, and appeared to be making a charge.</p>
        <p>But a three-putt from 25 feet at the 18th dropped Inkster back into a tie at four-under 140.</p>
