        <p>Canada Moving to Guard Integrity of Its Diamonds  Canadian officials, acting to protect their country's emerging diamond industry, are taking steps to ensure that their stones are never confused with the ''blood diamonds'' that help to finance guerrilla armies in Sierra Leone and Angola. For instance, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are developing a technology to ''fingerprint'' diamonds, identifying them by trace impurities that could be traced to known mines.</p>

        <p>U.S. to Forgo Hearings On EgyptAir 990 Crash  The government's top air safey investigator said there were no safety issues that would require a public hearing into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 last fall, and he disclosed information that reinforced suspicion that a co-pilot deliberately plunged the plane into the Atlantic Ocean off Nantucket, killing all 217 people aboard. The information included F.B.I. reports showing that the co-pilot, Gamil al-Batouti, had been accused of various sexual improprieties at a Manhattan hotel in the year before the crash.</p>

Buchanan, nominated for president by one faction of the Reform Party, selected as his running mate Ezola Foster, a black woman who taught public school for years in South Central Los Angeles.

        <p>Police Retirements Surge; Discontent Cited as Factor  More than 700 police officers have filed for retirement this year, a 38 percent increase over the same seven-month period last year. Department officials say that is a trickle in a department with 40,000 officers, but union leaders say it is the start of a major exodus, as officers seek better-paying, less dangerous jobs where no one calls them names.</p>

        <p>Doctor Barred From Practicing  The State Department of Health suspended the medical license of Dr. Niels H. Lauersen, a well-known fertility specialist with a busy, celebrity-favored practice; he is facing retrial on insurance fraud charges.</p>

        <p>A Campaign Stop on 'Tonight'  Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jay Leno bantered gently during her appearance on ''The Tonight Show,'' but she also sought to steer the conversation toward serious subjects integral to her Senate campaign. Mrs. Clinton's three-day campaign and fund-raising schedule will be capped with a prime-time speech to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles on Monday.</p>
        <p>B1</p>
        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio scoffed at Mrs. Clinton's assertion that she played a quiet but major role in Clinton administration policy and legislative efforts.</p>

        <p>Trade Center Elevator Accident  Twelve people were trapped for an hour between the 78th and 79th floors of the World Trade Center after their elevator overshot a floor, hit a ceiling and dropped 15 feet. Injuries included cuts and broken bones.</p>
