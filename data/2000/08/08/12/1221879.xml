        <p>As the latest twist in a political convention filled with them, Patrick J. Buchanan today shattered the emerging image of the Reform Party as a haven for white conservatives by selecting as his running mate a black woman who taught public school for years in South Central Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Hours later, the larger of the party's feuding factions nominated Mr. Buchanan as its presidential candidate. With the smaller group nominating John Hagelin, the fight over $12.6 million in federal campaign funds was joined, to be fought out over the next few weeks before the Federal Election Commission and, in all likelihood, a federal court.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan's pick of Ezola Foster, whose hard-right views virtually mirror his own, made her the first black candidate to seek the vice presidency for what is, arguably, a major party. There have been black candidates for president, including Shirley Chisholm, a congresswoman from New York who sought the Democratic nomination in 1972.</p>
        <p>In presenting Ms. Foster at a midday rally, where almost no one knew who she was until he introduced her, Mr. Buchanan gave no indication that the ticket would face further obstacles, legal or otherwise, on the march to the November elections.</p>
        <p>''I think this lady will be a tremendous benefit to our cause, to our campaign and to our movement,'' Mr. Buchanan said. ''She'll be an ambassador to America for what this party is all about. This shows that we are a party that is open to everybody.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan, who has brought new energy to the Reform Party since Ross Perot left it in 1996 only to see it fracture this week, had closely guarded the identity of his pick since the convention began on Thursday. But even with all the speculation over who it might be, the rumored names never included Ms. Foster. This is a convention, after all, in which the vast majority of delegates are white, and most are men.</p>
        <p>Yet Ms. Foster, 62, a former Democrat and former Republican who followed Mr. Buchanan into the Reform Party when he left the Republicans last year, has been known to Mr. Buchanan for years.</p>
        <p>A public school teacher and administrator for 33 years and a twice-failed candidate for the California State Assembly, she is founder of a California organization called Americans for Family Values.</p>
        <p>Ms. Foster was an ardent supporter of Proposition 187, the 1994 California measure that sought to deny aid to illegal immigrants, before courts struck it down. She favors local control of public schools and opposes programs in them that promote safe sex.</p>
        <p>This year, Mr. Buchanan named her as a co-chairwoman of his campaign.</p>
        <p>At her introduction, Ms. Foster discounted any role that race might play in her candidacy, insisting: ''We want to do what's right for all Americans. We have to stop appeasing one group after another.''</p>
        <p>Even so, she seemed an unlikely choice for Mr. Buchanan, whose views are so far to the right on many issues that he has especially strong appeal to fringe groups that include white supremacists, militia members and anti-Semites.</p>
        <p>Bay Buchanan, who serves as the chief campaign strategist for her brother, said Ms. Foster emerged as the vice presidential choice over several others because she shared Mr. Buchanan's views on most issues and because ''she could hold her own in debates.''</p>
        <p>As for any votes and support the ticket might lose because the vice presidential candidate is a black woman, Ms. Buchanan said, ''If we lose them, then I say goodbye. I'm not interested in them, and I hope this pick tells them we are not interested in their help.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Foster's selection was also well received by many of Mr. Buchanan's supporters, who went out of their way to say they did not mind that she was black.</p>
        <p>''We're not prejudiced against blacks,'' said Sharman Ramsey, whose husband is a delegate from Dothan, Ala. ''We want competent, responsible people of any color.''</p>
        <p>Brendan Moore, a Florida delegate, said, ''Her selection lends us more credibility. It puts to bed a lot of the spin about us being a party of whites, because we're not.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan's moment of triumph as a nominee -- if not yet the nominee -- of a party he only joined last year after bolting the Republicans came after delegates in the faction supporting him voted almost unanimously to throw out a monthlong primary, in which fewer than 80,000 had bothered to participate, in favor of a vote by delegates.</p>
        <p>For the Reform Party, a political organization that Mr. Perot founded on the principle that ultimate power lies with ordinary voters, it was the first time in three presidential election campaigns that the voters' will was ignored.</p>
        <p>But the move was widely viewed as a way to protect Mr. Buchanan against legal action by Mr. Hagelin, who has accused the Buchanan campaign of election fraud.</p>
        <p>In a complaint to the Federal Election Commission filed on Thursday, the Hagelin campaign charged that Mr. Buchanan's supporters sent primary ballots to as many as 500,000 people who are ineligible to vote in the Reform primary.</p>
        <p>The results of the primary were not disclosed to the larger group. They were to the smaller. But even though Mr. Buchanan won 49,529 to 28,539, in voting totals that represented just 10 percent of the ballots distributed, the pro-Hagelin group also voted to throw out Mr. Buchanan's votes as fraudulent and named Mr. Hagelin by acclamation its presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>In accepting the nomination, Mr. Hagelin called on the feuding factions and all independent parties to unite as an alternative to Republicans and Democrats.</p>
        <p>''Ninety percent of all we cherish has come from third-party voices,'' Mr. Hagelin said. ''This is a powerful, powerful movement. We should begin the process of healing and rebuilding, putting aside the small ideas that divide us and replace them with grand ideas that unite us.''</p>
