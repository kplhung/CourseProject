        <p>He helped lead the charge to lure the Democratic National Convention. He helped finish the fund-raising for a grand new concert hall. He helped recruit the new school superintendent. He founded one art museum and has plans to vastly expand another, and to revive a historically anemic downtown. He's the mayor's best friend, and helped bankroll campaigns to elect a new school board and pass a new city charter. And, oh, did we mention, he's the richest man in town, worth more than $5 billion?</p>
        <p>Almost every sphere of civic life in Los Angeles these days bears the fingerprints of one soft-spoken, silver-haired 67-year-old man: Eli Broad, chairman and chief executive of Sun America Inc., the financial services and investment giant that for most of the 1990's was the fastest-growing company on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>The Bronx-born son of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants who began his career at 21 as the youngest certified public accountant in Michigan history, then developed a home-building empire that stretched from Detroit to Los Angeles, Mr. Broad has in the last few years become his adopted city's ultimate go-to guy.</p>
        <p>As the Democrats arrive next week, Mr. Broad (rhymes with road) will be front and center to welcome them, though perhaps not as front and center as he wished. He did not get either the speaking slot at the convention or the skybox at the Staples Center that he had asked for. (He will have to share one of three skyboxes with the local host committee, of which he is a co-chairman and to which he gave $1 million while helping raise several times that.)</p>
        <p>But Mr. Broad, and his supporters and critics alike, are quick to agree that he has flourished in Los Angeles as he could have in few other cities, if any, where tradition, schools, clubs and old-boy networks matter more and moxie and money matter less.</p>
        <p>''It's very simple,'' Mr. Broad said as the afternoon sun filtered over a broad swath of Beverly Hills outside his office window. ''It's a meritocracy. You can come here without the right family background, which I don't have, the right religion, the right political affiliation, and if you're willing to reach out and really work and spend your time, energy and sometimes your money, you're accepted. That's not true of most other cities in the world or North America.</p>
        <p>''And that's one of the reasons I love the city, because it's allowed me to do all this.''</p>
        <p>Former Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, who has known him since they worked on Alan Cranston's campaign for the United States Senate more than 30 years ago, said Mr. Broad ''is making a herculean effort to fill a vacuum'' in Los Angeles's civic leadership.</p>
        <p>''When he does something, he does it all out,'' Mr. Kantor said. ''Most of the time he succeeds. Sometimes he does not. But the fact is that some people, whether they are threatened by it or resent it, are irritated by anyone who pushes that hard and demands action. He does not sit around and suffer inaction.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Richard J. Riordan, a Republican businessman who has recruited Mr. Broad, a lifelong Democrat, to help in innumerable civic causes, finds a more mischievous way to describe his friend's bluntness: ''Eli knows nothing about foreplay.''</p>
        <p>The convention is a case in point. Mr. Broad was among a handful of people who wanted the chance to show off the city's recovery from the fires, earthquake, riots and recession of the early 1990's, and was one of the original co-chairmen of the local host committee, which pledged to finance the convention by raising more than $35 million and to use city money only for typically municipal services like transportation and security.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles got the convention, but ever since has had trouble raising the promised money. And Mr. Broad has complained publicly and privately that at least one of his fellow co-chairmen, the record and movie mogul David Geffen, failed to put up any of his own.</p>
        <p>Andy Spahn, Mr. Geffen's chief political aide, said Mr. Geffen had made clear from the beginning that he would help bring the convention to Los Angeles but intended to direct his fund-raising and contribution efforts to the actual electing of Democrats, beginning with Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>''This is a case of no good deed going unpunished,'' Mr. Spahn said.</p>
        <p>But bad blood and embarrassing headlines have lingered for months.</p>
        <p>''What happened?'' Mr. Broad said of the controversy. ''I'll tell you what happened. I got all the press, that's what happened. And why did I get all the press? I was there.''</p>
        <p>Every city has a cadre of civic leaders who support the elected government, raise money for cultural institutions and charitable causes, and offer private advice to public figures. In the 1950's and 60's, Los Angeles itself had the Committee of 25, a shadowy conclave of businessmen who helped pick candidates for appointment or election to public office and generally set the tone in the city until the Watts riots set off changes in the municipal power structure.</p>
        <p>But with a shift in the region's economy from large, home-grown industries like aerospace to multimedia conglomerates, with a wave of mergers and acquisitions that have left downtown Los Angeles lacking a headquarters of a single Fortune 500 company, and with his own considerable ambition, Mr. Broad has emerged as a virtual committee of one, or, as he puts it, a venture philanthropist.</p>
        <p>That has not always endeared him to some officials and fellow billionaires here, who complain -- invariably under cloak of anonymity -- that he is too quick to claim credit, too willing to hog the spotlight, too wrapped up in his own pet projects.</p>
        <p>''I've got a big ego,'' Mr. Broad said matter-of-factly in a recent interview in his 38th-floor headquarters in a Century City office tower. ''I like to be thought of well.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Broad is also something of a rarity in an age of handlers and spin doctors, consultants and retainers. He returns his own phone calls, often flies commercial and still shows up at the kinds of business breakfasts and chicken dinners that most moguls eschew. A few years ago, he used his American Express card to buy a Roy Lichtenstein at Sotheby's for $2.5 million, because he had calculated the interest he could earn by delaying the payment for a month. (He also got 2.5 million frequent-flier  miles, most of which he gave away to a local arts college for student travel.)</p>
        <p>''Usually, people are visionaries or doers, but not both,'' said Mr. Riordan, who regularly vacations with Mr. Broad on cruises and bike and ski trips. ''He is both a visionary and an incredible doer, who gets onto something like a pit bull and won't let go until he gets it done. To a point that drives you nuts sometimes. On vacation, you want to avoid him. He spent our last vacation, in Sun Valley, on four major topics of what the city needed to do. I just wanted to run the other way.''</p>
        <p>Asked a couple of years ago what Mr. Broad wanted, one leading Angeleno, a respected graybeard among the city's power players, said, ''I think he wants to be the single most influential private citizen in Los Angeles,'' adding with a chuckle, ''And he's got the money to do it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Broad has not managed to get everything he wants -- his bid to draw a National Football League team to a revamped Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum failed last year, as did his rivals' -- but it is not for lack of trying.</p>
        <p>Associates say that working for him is like working for a jackhammer, that he is fair but relentless, keeping four aides busy in his outer office alone. Golf and other leisure activities hold not the slightest allure; he keeps his perpetual tan by holding long business meetings or reading papers outdoors. His speech, in the flat accent of Michigan, is economical, tending to omit prepositions and definite articles, so that he says, ''I was born New York City.'' Even his passion, collecting modern art, is a business, with a curator and a lending foundation.</p>
        <p>His impatience is also legendary. A few years ago, irked that the world-famous architect Frank Gehry was taking too long to finish his new house in the Brentwood section, Mr. Broad hired another architect, with the result that Mr. Gehry disowned the house. (That feud threatened to derail Mr. Broad's later efforts to raise money to finish the Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles, which Mr. Gehry also designed, but things were smoothed over.) Just now, on the site of two former houses in Malibu, Mr. Broad is building a 4,000-square-foot beach house designed by Richard Meier, who designed the new Getty Center here.</p>
        <p>''It's a white Richard Meier house,'' Mr. Broad said, ''and I think white Richard Meier houses look great in beach areas.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Broad's current projects, both just beginning, are an expansion of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, on whose board he serves, with a new wing and pedestrian arcade (an effort to which he will  presumably give millions of dollars) and a public-private undertaking to revive Grand Avenue, the downtown street that is already home to the Los Angeles Music Center and the Museum of Contemporary Art (which Mr. Broad helped found 20 years ago) and that will soon see the completion of the Disney hall and a new cathedral for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Just talking about downtown gets him so excited that he pulls out a pad and starts sketching his vision of a new park, pedestrian-friendly sidewalks, restaurants and so on.</p>
        <p>''We don't own anything downtown,'' Mr. Broad said. ''All downtown does is cost me a lot of money. But every great metropolitan area needs a core. This city doesn't have any real core. It doesn't have a place where people from different communities can come for free concerts.''</p>
        <p>Some elected officials have complained that Mr. Broad involves himself in matters, like selecting a new school superintendent, that are none of his business. But he professes pride in such involvement.</p>
        <p>''If I think I'm doing what's right,'' he said, ''I think at the end of the day people will appreciate it and I'll feel good about it.  And along the way I'm not looking for votes.''</p>
