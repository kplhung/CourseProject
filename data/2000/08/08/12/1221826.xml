        <p>A quiet effort to negotiate a new state flag for Georgia that eliminates its Confederate symbol has suddenly become very public, after a leading civil rights organization asked the National Collegiate Athletic Association to move its planned basketball championships from Atlanta if the flag was not changed.</p>
        <p>In a letter sent on Thursday, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which was founded by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., asked the N.C.A.A. to move the 2002 and 2007 Men's Final Four and the 2003 Women's Final Four from Atlanta if the flag was not redesigned by next spring.</p>
        <p>The N.C.A.A. executive committee met today in Indianapolis and took no action on the request, but issued a statement criticizing any official symbol that ''conveys discrimination and racism'' and urging more discussion of the issue. Charles Wethington, president of the University of Kentucky and chairman of the committee, said the organization would watch the issue closely because it was concerned about the welfare of student athletes who travel to championships.</p>
        <p>Two-thirds of the Georgia flag consists of the Confederate battle symbol, placed there by the State Legislature in 1956, two years after school segregation was ruled illegal by the Supreme Court. Many historians believe the flag was changed as an act of defiance against federal civil rights legislation, and the city of Atlanta refuses to fly it on official buildings.</p>
        <p>The issue has taken on a heightened focus elsewhere in the South in recent months. In May, after a long debate, the South Carolina Legislature voted to remove the Confederate battle flag from the dome of the Statehouse.</p>
        <p>Also in May, Gov. Ronnie Musgrove of Mississippi formed an advisory commission to design a new state flag, after the state's high court found that, because of a legal technicality, the old one -- which, like Georgia's, includes the Confederate battle symbol -- had not been officially sanctioned since 1906.</p>
        <p>In Georgia today, the leadership conference's request, signed by its president, Martin Luther King III, surprised several black elected officials who hope to change the flag's design in the next session of the Georgia Legislature, which begins in January. Many who want a new flag are hoping to change the minds of opponents without the kind of boycott that polarized the debate in South Carolina.</p>
        <p>''We had hoped to have more dialogue than action at this time,'' said Calvin Smyre, chairman of the Democratic caucus of the Georgia House and a prominent black legislator. ''At the appropriate time, external pressure may be the right course of action, but right now we need to have some internal political dialogue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smyre, a life member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said he was not criticizing the organization, but was surprised by its action.</p>
        <p>Many white state legislators, both Democratic and Republican, and particularly in rural areas, fear that if they agree to change the flag, they will be turned out of office. Even Gov. Roy Barnes said recently that the state was not ready for a new flag yet, and has not publicly advocated a new one.</p>
        <p>But supporters of a new flag say the time for change may come soon after a new Legislature is elected in November, two years before the next election, by which time voter anger may have faded. As a result, talk of a boycott has been muted in the hope that white legislators would not feel pressured.</p>
        <p>Mr. King did not return phone calls today. In his letter to the N.C.A.A., he said that the boycott of South Carolina was a ''key factor for change,'' and noted that his organization had canceled its convention there last year. Without being specific, he said his organization had initiated a campaign to remove the Confederate symbol from the Georgia flag.</p>
