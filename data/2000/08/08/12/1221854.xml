        <p>The union representing New York City teachers jumped into the debate yesterday over how to rid troubled schools of uncertified teachers, asking the city to expand a costly incentive program intended to draw veteran teachers into those schools.</p>
        <p>The program, created last year, gives certified teachers 15 percent raises if they transfer into low-performing schools. The teachers have to work an extra 40 minutes per day, but only about half that time is spent with students in the classroom. The program applies now to only 39 of the city's 99 failing schools, known as SURR schools or ''schools under registration review.''</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said yesterday that if the incentive plan were expanded to all 99 schools, the city could easily fill every vacancy in those schools with certified teachers.</p>
        <p>Finding certified teachers to fill all the vacancies is a top priority for Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, because a new state policy requires him to do so. Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, filed a lawsuit against Mr. Levy last week to press him to comply with the policy this fall.</p>
        <p>''We are offering to the court and to the parties what we believe will be a very innovative and effective solution,'' Ms. Weingarten said at a news conference yesterday. ''We believe this will not only help solve the problem of getting seasoned, certified teachers into these other SURR schools but it will give thousands of other kids a better chance to succeed.''</p>
        <p>The incentive program could not be expanded without the approval of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, since he controls the school system's budget. Ms. Weingarten said the expansion would cost $30 million to $60 million, depending on the number of vacancies. But aides to both Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Levy were circumspect about the union's proposal.</p>
        <p>''There are also a number of other initiatives that can help turn around failing schools,'' Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles said in a statement, mentioning privatization and merit pay -- two proposals that are anathema to the union -- as alternatives.</p>
        <p>Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for Mr. Levy, said only, ''We are looking at every option.''</p>
        <p>About 600 teachers applied to transfer into the 39 schools that offered the incentive last year, and about 300 were accepted.</p>
        <p>Critics have questioned why teachers deserved higher salaries for working in low-performing schools, especially considering that much of the extra 40 minutes per day is not spent with students.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Weingarten, arguing the virtues of the union's plan, said yesterday that the percentage of fourth- and eighth-grade students who passed standardized reading tests  rose more than twice as much in the 39 ''extended-time schools'' as in SURR schools that did not offer the salary incentive.</p>
        <p>Overall, the extended-time schools showed a 7.1 percent increase in the number of children passing the tests, compared with a 3.4 percent increase in the other SURR schools, she said.</p>
        <p>The additional 40 minutes per day in the extended-time schools is divided between tutoring and training. For the first few weeks of the school year, teachers spend all of the additional time on training -- specifically, familiarizing themselves with the schools' intensive curriculums. After that, they use the extra time for training two days a week, and for tutoring the other three days.</p>
        <p>''When you invest in teacher training it correlates to higher student achievement,'' Ms. Weingarten said.</p>
        <p>In his lawsuit, Mr. Mills is demanding that Mr. Levy not only replace several hundred unlicensed teachers hired last year, but also fill any additional vacancies with certified teachers. Board officials estimate they will need to fill about 600 positions. Mr. Levy has prepared several responses to the problem, including an alternative certification program that is giving 350 people with little or no teaching experience an intensive training program this summer.</p>
        <p>Another potential solution is to transfer senior teachers into the SURR schools involuntarily without any incentives, an idea that the union rejects. Mr. Levy has said that he would be loath to transfer teachers against their will, so such a measure seems unlikely. Nonetheless, Ms. Weingarten made a point yesterday of saying she would fight any involuntary transfer plan in court.</p>
