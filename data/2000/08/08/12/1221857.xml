        <p>News Corporation to Buy Chris-Craft for $3.5 Billion  The News Corporation has agreed to acquire Chris-Craft Industries, the television station company, for $85 a share, or a total of $3.5 billion, a person close to the discussions said. Earlier in the day, Viacom pulled out of merger talks with Chris-Craft.</p>
        <p>Such a combination would put tremendous control of television stations into the hands of Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation. Chris-Craft, which is controlled by Herbert J. Siegel, owns 10 TV stations, while the News Corporation owns 22. [Page C2.]</p>
        <p>Dow Climbs Above 11,000 Again  Stocks rose as blue-chip companies surged on encouraging economic data. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 119.04 points, or 1.09 percent, to 11,027.80, crossing the 11,000 threshold for the first time since April. Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was up 11.59 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,471.84, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 29.48 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,789.47, having recovered from a loss of 60 points earlier in the session.

        <p>Firestone Struggles to Keep Up  As confused consumers kept phones ringing off the hooks at dealers across the country, Firestone struggled to cope with the demand for replacement tires unleashed by its recall of 6.5 million tires for sport utility vehicles. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Reports Suggest No Rate Change  Retail sales rose in July at the fastest pace in five months, while prices paid to manufacturers, farmers and other producers were little changed, two reports showed. Sales, led by gains at auto dealers, department stores and building supply outlets, rose 0.7 percent in July after a revised 0.4 percent June increase, the government said. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Jury Rules Disney Stole an Idea  Walt Disney stole ideas for a sports complex from two businessmen and should pay $240 million in damages, a jury ruled. Nicholas Stracick, Edward Russell and their company, All Pro Sports Camps, accused Disney of fraud, theft of trade secrets, breaking an implied contract and breaching a confidential relationship. The six-member jury accepted all the claims except fraud. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Barclays Agrees to Buy Woolwich  Barclays, Britain's third-largest bank, agreed to acquire Woolwich, a British mortgage lender and former building society, for $:5.4 billion, or $8.1 billion. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Cheney's Retirement Payout Set  Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential candidate, is expected to receive an early retirement package worth an estimated $20 million when he officially steps down next Wednesday as chairman and chief executive of Halliburton, according to people who have reviewed the deal. The Halliburton board approved the package in Dallas on July 20, five days before Gov. George W. Bush announced his selection of Mr. Cheney, 59, as his running mate. [A1.]</p>
        <p>The Man of the Hour in Los Angeles  Almost every sphere of civic life in Los Angeles these days bears the fingerprints of one soft-spoken, silver-haired 67-year-old man: Eli Broad, the chairman and chief executive of Sun America. As the Democrats troop into town next week, Mr. Broad will be there to welcome them, though perhaps not as front-and-center as he wished. [A12.]</p>
        <p>Wackenhut in South African Deal  Wackenhut Corrections signed a 25-year contract, valued at $245 million, to build and operate a 3,024-bed maximum-security penitentiary in South Africa. The prison, expected to be ready in about 18 months, is the first such venture in Africa for the company, which is based in Florida and operates correctional sites in the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and the Caribbean.
