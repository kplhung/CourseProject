        <p>French investigators looking into the possibility that kickbacks were paid by the French oil company Elf Aquitaine for the purchase of a dilapidated oil refinery in the former East Germany have issued an international arrest warrant for Dieter Holzer, a businessman with links to German intelligence who is suspected of having paid millions of dollars in bribes. Mr. Holzer has admitted to receiving $23 million in ''commissions'' in the 1992 deal by Elf for a refinery in Leuna, in eastern Germany, but he denies paying any of the money as kickbacks. Elf has since been acquired by the French oil company Total.</p>
