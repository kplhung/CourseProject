        <p>Sidewalk pennants that proclaim Yellowknife the Diamond Capital of North America help explain why Canadians are working to ensure that their gems are not confused with the ''blood diamonds'' of Africa.</p>
        <p>''We have a clean upfront business,'' the provincial premier, Stephen Kakfwi, said in an interview, throwing diplomatic subtleties to the Arctic winds. ''You don't have to go through the jungles of Angola or Sierra Leone dealing with guerrillas and dictators.''</p>
        <p>In the largest industrial project above the North American tree line, the Ekati Mine opened almost 200 miles northeast of here two years ago and now produces $1.3 million worth of diamonds a day, or 5 percent of the world production. When two other nearby mines start producing by 2005, the Northwest Territories are generally expected to produce as much as 15 percent of the world's diamonds.</p>
        <p>The lone large producer in the Americas, Canada will then join the top diamond producers, which include Angola, Botswana, Russia and South Africa. With that future glittering on the horizon like a mineral aurora borealis, Canadian officials are acting to protect the image of diamonds, in contrast to the trafficking in uncut stones that helps pay for guerrilla armies in Sierra Leone and Angola.</p>
        <p>''To do otherwise would be to court commercial catastrophe,'' the Canadian ambassador to the United Nations, Robert R. Fowler, told the World Diamond Congress, an industry group, in a speech last month in Belgium. ''In Canada in the 1970's, we watched our fur industry, the business upon which our country was founded, destroyed by a small number of very shrill and very effective animal rights activists.''</p>
        <p>Many Indian families have yet to recover income lost when consumer resistance to fur coats wiped out in a few years a tradition of commercial trapping that dated from the 1700's, and a potential consumer reaction against diamonds strikes fear in the Northwest Territories, a wilderness larger than Texas and California combined, but with a population of 40,000. Mr. Kakfwi, a member of the Dene tribe, estimated that the percentage of his people who make a living from trapping has plunged, to 5 percent from 65 percent 25 years ago.</p>
        <p>The territorial director of diamond projects, Martin Irving, said: ''We have been through it with fur, and we don't want to go through it with diamonds. If the issues with conflict diamonds don't get solved, the consumer is not going to be able to differentiate between the different kinds of diamonds and is going to be against diamonds, period.''</p>
        <p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are developing a technology to ''fingerprint'' diamonds, identifying them by trace impurities that can be traced to known mines.</p>
        <p>To promote the diamonds, the territorial government provides certificates to show that the diamonds were mined and cut in the Northwest Territories. One cutting and polishing company here, Sirius Diamonds, etches with a laser a tiny polar bear on each diamond. Other Canadian cutters use as their brands a maple leaf and a snow goose.</p>
        <p>And Canadians are involved in the crackdown on diamonds from war-torn areas. Mr. Fowler heads a United Nations committee that is investigating violations of an embargo on buying diamonds from Angolan rebels.</p>
        <p>Ralph Hazleton, a Canadian diamond expert, recently testified at the United Nations about Liberia and Burkina Faso's buying diamonds from Sierra Leone guerrillas in violation of a second embargo.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the images of war associated with West African diamonds, Mr. Irving said, Canadian marketers want to associate Arctic diamonds ''with images of the north -- ice, clean, pristine, crystal clear.''</p>
        <p>To provide jobs, the territorial government has insisted that mines market at least 10 percent of their raw diamonds locally.</p>
        <p>In the last year, Sirius and two other cutting and polishing companies have opened here, with the cutting skills largely coming from Antwerp. In future years, hundreds of millions of dollars of diamond-mining investments are expected. Today, mining projects are under way for 12 out of the territory's estimated 325 kimberlite pipes, the funnel-shaped veins of diamond-bearing rock associated with ancient volcanoes.</p>
        <p>From London, De Beers Consolidated Mines, the company that controls two-thirds of the world trade in uncut diamonds, is suddenly focusing its investing telescope on this frontier town of 18,000 people. Since late June, De Beers has invested in one company that is prospecting for diamonds in the Northwest Territories and has begun a hostile takeover bid for another company that is about four years from production.</p>
        <p>''We want to be an international diamond center, a place where Israelis, where people from New York will come to secure their diamonds,'' Mr. Kakfwi said. That will be a stretch for a territory whose umbilical cord to ''the south'' consists of daily flights to Edmonton, Alberta.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 15, 2000, Tuesday  A front-page article on Saturday about Canada's diamond industry misstated the title of Stephen Kakfwi, the top official in the Northwest Territories, where diamonds are mined. He is the territorial premier, not the provincial premier; the region is not a province.</p>
