        <p>RICHARD J. RIORDAN is not central casting's idea of a big city mayor. He has no ''How'm I doin'?'' chutzpah, no big stick. He is no speechmaker and is terrible on television. Even some of his allies refer to him with a mix of affection and exasperation as ''Mayor Magoo.''</p>
        <p>The other day, at a ceremony related to the opening of the Democratic National Convention, which he had worked so hard to lure, Mr. Riordan, a Republican, actually said, ''I just want to say those three magic words: Welcome to the City of Angels.'' He once introduced the actress Tyne Daly as ''Tiny.''</p>
        <p>But for seven years, Mr. Riordan, a multimillionaire businessman and lawyer who works for $1 a year, has presided over this city's recovery from riots, fires, earthquake and the worst recession in 50 years with implausible success. With his own money and the help of wealthy friends, he financed successful campaigns to limit the terms of local elected officials, pass a new city charter to restructure government and elect a new majority on the board of education to deal with beleaguered schools in a city where his official powers are weak and political involvement low.</p>
        <p>''He does this, 'I'm just a country lawyer' thing, and very slick guys in blue suits screw up because they mistake that facade,'' said a former chief of staff, Robin Kramer. ''Because there's a very capable, highly intelligent and very practical guy behind it.''</p>
        <p>For about two minutes on the convention podium on Monday, Mr. Riordan will stand in a national spotlight usually reserved for his more colorful counterparts as he welcomes Democrats. When he set out to bring the convention to town more than two years ago, Mr. Riordan had no idea that delegates would arrive in the midst of the worst police corruption scandal in decades and amid fears of disruptive street protests, but he was philosophical this week.</p>
        <p>''I feel like a father putting on a wedding for his oldest daughter and being driven nuts,'' Mr. Riordan said in an interview in the City Hall conference room, surrounded by autographed photographs of President Clinton and photos of the restless, 70-year-old mayor biking and jogging. ''And then at the last minute everything comes together and you have a great time. But, really, this has not been easy.''</p>
        <p>That was a typical understatement. For months, convention planning had been plagued by troubles raising money, infighting and, for a time, Mr. Riordan's inattention. Last winter, Mr. Riordan began making phone calls to raise some $5 million to cover convention costs and spent at least 10 percent of his time on planning. In the end, Terry McAuliffe, the Democrats' most prolific fund-raiser, had to step in to help raise money.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Riordan has had to contend with the worst police corruption scandal in decades, in which rogue officers have been accused of fabricating testimony and, in at least one instance, handcuffing and shooting an unarmed man, then implicating him in a crime and watching him go to prison paralyzed from the waist down. The United States Justice Department, which was already investigating patterns of police misconduct here, has threatened a civil rights lawsuit if the city does not accept a binding agreement to make long-promised changes in officer training.</p>
        <p>In the last year of his second term, even some longtime supporters say Mr. Riordan seems adrift. Senior aides have left, and he barely speaks to the man who was once his most trusted confidant, William M.  Wardlaw, a Democratic lawyer. Mr. Riordan has not forgiven Mr. Wardlaw for backing the city attorney, James K. Hahn, a Democrat, for mayor next year, while Mr. Riordan, who built an unusual coalition of white suburban homeowners and inner-city Hispanics in the wake of the 1992 riots, favors a fellow Republican businessman, Steve Soboroff.</p>
        <p>BUT Mr. Riordan insists he is busier than ever.</p>
        <p>''I always say, and I really believe this, that if you start thinking about a legacy, then it takes your eye off the ball,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riordan, born in Flushing, Queens, to a father who was an executive at the department store Abraham and Strauss and a mother who was a homemaker, came to politics by a nontraditional route. After graduating from Princeton, and ranking first in his class at the University of Michigan Law School, he made a fortune in the leveraged buyout business in the 1980's. He has a longstanding interest in education, and his private foundation has given away $30 million over 20 years in support of education. He said he would like nothing better when he leaves office than to finance and become the principal of a charter school.</p>
        <p>''He's an odd combination, because he's such a restless guy, with a short attention span, and his mind always seems to be jumping to the next thing,'' said Patt Morrison, a columnist for The Los Angeles Times and one of the members, including the actor Alan Alda and the sociologist James Q. Wilson, of the mayor's book club, which gathers in the 40,000-volume library at Mr. Riordan's house in Brentwood to tackle authors from Stendhal to Raymond Chandler. ''And yet he takes on a great deal of serious reading,'' Ms. Morrison said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Mr. Riordan's biggest failure has been his inability to get along with the 15-member City Council, all but three of whom are Democrats.</p>
        <p>''It's more words than reality,'' he said. ''Some of the liberals who would like to be friendly with me are afraid, afraid they'd be thrown out of the liberal cult.''</p>
