        <p>As confused consumers kept phones ringing off the hooks yesterday at dealers across the country, Bridgestone/Firestone struggled to cope with the demand for replacement tires unleashed by its recall of 6.5 million tires for sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>The company said it planned to double its production of tires in the United States and to step up its imports from other plants run by Bridgestone, its Japanese parent. The domestic increases will not include a plant in Decatur, Ill., to which Firestone has traced a disproportionate number of the tire failures that led to the recall, the second biggest in its 100-year history.</p>

        <p>As confused consumers kept phones ringing off the hooks yesterday at dealers across the country, Bridgestone/Firestone struggled to cope with the demand for replacement tires unleashed by its recall of 6.5 million tires for sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>The company said it planned to double its production of tires in the United States and to step up its imports from other plants run by Bridgestone, its Japanese parent. The domestic increases will not include a plant in Decatur, Ill., to which Firestone has traced a disproportionate number of the tire failures that led to the recall, the second biggest in its 100-year history.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, dealers were still impatiently waiting for Firestone to give them a definite timetable for when replacement tires will roll in.</p>
        <p>''Customers are calling from the time we open until the time we close, and we don't expect the calls to slow down before next week,'' said Scott McClain, a sales manager at S &amp; S Tire, which runs 22 retail stores in Kentucky and also serves as wholesaler to other dealers.</p>
        <p>The recall includes all of Firestone's ATX and ATX II tires for 15-inch wheels, as well as Wilderness tires of the same size with a Department of Transportation 10-digit designation starting with the letters VD; these latter tires are the ones made at the Decatur plant. Because most of the reported incidents involve motorists driving in hot-weather regions -- and because supplies of replacement tires are short -- the recall is being conducted in phases, starting in the Sun Belt states.</p>
        <p>The recall, a response to reports of 46 deaths in accidents and hundreds of tire failures, has been extended to Canada and Mexico. Most tires being recalled were supplied as original equipment on Ford Explorers, the most popular sport utility vehicle.</p>
        <p>In most cases, even dealers without replacement tires available have told customers to come in, if only to make sure that their tires are properly inflated. Firestone recommends 30 pounds per square inch; Ford has said 26 will do. Most dealers say 30 is a minimum inflation level for safety; many recommend 32 or even higher.</p>
        <p>Mr. McClain said he spent two days this week walking through an S &amp; S retail outlet, checking tire pressure on customers' Ford Explorers. Some were as high as 45 P.S.I. -- an overinflation level that could itself cause a tire to eventually burst -- and some as low as 20 P.S.I. ''No tire is safe if you are running it underinflated at 100 miles an hour,'' he said. Many dealers said their customers were expressing wariness about all Firestone tires, not just those being recalled.</p>
        <p>''When you find a bad batch of beef, you don't suddenly say that all beef from that store is bad,'' said Larry Morgan, who owns Morgan Tire and Auto Inc., a large dealership in Clearwater, Fla. ''But a lot of people are inappropriately abusing the name Firestone when they should just be thinking of a particular Firestone product line.''</p>
        <p>Although Firestone is giving California, Arizona and other hot-weather states first priority for replacement tires, dealers in other states are unwilling to make their own customers wait. On Wednesday, when Firestone announced the recall, S &amp; S had 3,500 Wilderness tires -- not counting any being recalled -- in stock. It has already used them up, and is almost out of similar tires from other manufacturers as well. The company has ordered 2,500 more S.U.V.-compatible tires from Goodyear, Michelin and other Firestone competitors.</p>
        <p>Wright Tire, a large independent dealership in Anoka, Minn. that derives about 95 percent of its sales from Firestone tires, is getting more breathing room. The owner, Thomas Wright, said he got as many as 300 calls a day on Wednesday and Thursday, but that the volume had tapered  off by yesterday afternoon. Mr. Wright, who is also president of the Tire Association of North America, has replaced about 30 sets of tires from stock, and has scheduled another 75 tire replacements for the future.</p>
        <p>But in his view, customer panic is misplaced. ''Probably 80 percent of the Firestone tires we've sold have gone on S.U.V.'s, many of them on Ford Explorers, and we've never had one reported problem,'' he said. ''If you keep the tire properly inflated, it runs just fine.''</p>
