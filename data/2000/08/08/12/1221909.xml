        <p>Oleg Krayzelburg had one piece of advice for his son, Lenny, before the United States Olympic trials: ''Break world records.''</p>
        <p>They were an immigrant's expectations. Oleg and Yelena Krayzelburg brought their two children to Los Angeles from the Soviet Union in 1989, seeking harbor from anti-Semitism and from the possibility that their son would be conscripted when he turned 18. Lenny Krayzelburg had been an age-group champion in Odessa in what is now Ukraine. A born backstroker, his coach had called him. For his father, those words were as indelible as a stamp on a passport.</p>

        <p>Oleg Krayzelburg had one piece of advice for his son, Lenny, before the United States Olympic trials: ''Break world records.''</p>
        <p>They were an immigrant's expectations. Oleg and Yelena Krayzelburg brought their two children to Los Angeles from the Soviet Union in 1989, seeking harbor from anti-Semitism and from the possibility that their son would be conscripted when he turned 18. Lenny Krayzelburg had been an age-group champion in Odessa in what is now Ukraine. A born backstroker, his coach had called him. For his father, those words were as indelible as a stamp on a passport.</p>
        <p>''His expectations are pretty high,'' Lenny said with a laugh late this morning, seven hours before he was to swim the final of the 100-meter backstroke. ''Sometimes he has higher expectations than what is possible. But I know how to handle it. As long as I win, that's all that matters.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, he did just that. Krayzelburg, who is 24, did not break his own world record of 53.60 seconds, but he won the 100 backstroke in 53.84 seconds. Neil Walker, who missed the 1996 Olympic team by a hundredth of a second, qualified tonight in second place in 53.85. Krayzelburg also holds the world record in the 200-meter backstroke of 1 minute 55.87 seconds and, with a leg on the medley relay, he could establish himself as the dominant American swimmer of the 2000 Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>''It truly is an honor; I've been waiting for this moment a long time,'' Krayzelburg said. ''I'm looking forward to going to Sydney to represent the United States and bring home the gold.''</p>
        <p>Also tonight, the ebullient Barbara (B.J.) Bedford, 27, of Etna, N.H., won the women's 100-meter backstroke in 1:01.85, qualifying for her first Olympic team at her fourth trials. Extremely nervous before the race, she threw up and placed a call to the Olympic training center in Colorado Springs to speak to a sports psychologist. Elated upon winning, she  hugged everyone within reach on the pool deck. Four years ago, Bedford had shaved her head for what became a disappointing meet. Tonight, she did not even have to shave time from her career best of 1:01.11 to win.</p>
        <p>''I am overwhelmed, excited and effervescent,'' Bedford said. Previously, she said the monkey on her back had become an orangutan. ''This is an unbelievable feeling. I don't think I'll be able to describe it for at least three or four years.''</p>
        <p>In the men's 200-meter freestyle, Josh Davis of San Antonio made a voracious attempt to break the world record of 1:45.51 held by Australia's teenage sensation, Ian Thorpe. Davis could not hold his early pace, but he still won in 1:47.26, breaking a 12-year-old American record held by Matt Biondi.</p>
        <p>In the women's 100-meter breaststroke, 16-year-old Megan Quann of Puyallup, Wash., finished first in 1:07.26, but did not challenge the American record of 1:07.12 she set in Thursday's preliminaries. Cristina Teuscher of New Rochelle, who did not qualify in the 400-meter individual medley on Wednesday, won the 200-meter semifinals tonight in 2:14.21. The final is Saturday.</p>
        <p>Dara Torres, 33, who finished second in the 100 butterfly on Thursday after a seven-year layoff, dropped out of the 200 freestyle semifinals tonight after suffering uterine cramping during the preliminary round this morning. She is still scheduled to compete in the 50 and 100 freestyles.</p>
        <p>''Dara has a history of severe uterine cramping during long races such as this one,'' Glen Luepnitz, her nutritionist, said in a statement. ''The cramping can be debilitating. Any type of intense activity can bring this about. Her blood pressure drops, she gets the cold shakes. It can come on during the warm-down.'' In the men's 100-backstroke, Krayzelburg  consummated a career that began when his father urged him to enter an army-sponsored sports club in Odessa at kindergarten age. By age 9, he and 44 other swimmers were together from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day at a sports school, being taught in the pool and in the classroom.</p>
        <p>When his family immigrated to West Hollywood, Calif., in March 1989, it seemed that his promising career might evaporate. At 13, Krayzelburg had little facility for English and no facility for swimming in his neighborhood. ''I want you to keep swimming,'' his father told him. But where? The school he attended, Fairfax High School, did not even have a swim team. For a year, he took a 50-minute bus ride each way to train at Santa Monica City College.</p>
        <p>The long commute and lack of proper training left him defeated. He wanted to quit, but his father would not let him. ''You put in so many years in Russia,'' Oleg Krayzelburg told his son. Lenny began training closer to home at the Westside Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles. The pool was only 25 yards in length, half the size of an Olympic pool, but the center was close to home and offered him a job as a lifeguard.</p>
        <p>After high school, he enrolled at Santa Monica City College in 1993 and set a national junior college record in the 200-yard backstroke. U.S.C. then offered a scholarship, and its coach, Mark Schubert, told Krayzelburg, ''If you are willing to work, you can be the best backstroker in the world.''</p>
        <p>''That's all I needed to hear,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Krayzelburg, who has a finance degree, became an American citizen in 1995, and a year later, finished sixth in the 200-meter backstroke at the 1996 Olympic trials. He has since become the world's dominant backstroker. Tonight, in a hydrodynamic suit that extended to his knees, Krayzelburg touched the wall in 25.6 seconds after 50 meters, second to Walker, but surged into the lead in the homestretch. He appeared to be on world-record pace but seemed to slow at the end, perhaps feeling pressure to break his record after coming within seven-hundredths of a second in Thursday's semifinals. Still, he won. Oleg Krayzelburg, a hospital chef, and Yelena, a bookkeeper, were in the stands watching. This is why they had come to the United States, to see their son become a success, opportunity fulfilled.</p>
        <p>''When I came here, I never imagined standing here today,'' Lenny Krayzelburg said. ''This is very special. I've been fortunate to get some opportunities and to take advantage of them with great people who were willing to help me be successful.''</p>
