        <p>This is a 30-second advertisement, ''Superimposed,'' produced by the Liberal Party, its first in the Senate race. The party had planned to endorse Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is a close friend of Raymond Harding, the party chairman. But after Mr. Giuliani dropped out, the party threw its support behind Hillary Rodham Clinton over the Republican nominee, Representative Rick A. Lazio. The ad is a response to one by the Republican Leadership Council, a Washington group that helps finance moderate candidates. That ad spliced images of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan against shots of Mr. Lazio, implying that Senator Moynihan, a Democrat, supported Mr. Lazio. Mr. Moynihan unsuccessfully sought the ad to be dropped. It is another example of ads that are paid for with largely unregulated contributions that do not directly solicit votes for individuals but do promote their candidacy.</p>

        <p>This is a 30-second advertisement, ''Superimposed,'' produced by the Liberal Party, its first in the Senate race. The party had planned to endorse Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is a close friend of Raymond Harding, the party chairman. But after Mr. Giuliani dropped out, the party threw its support behind Hillary Rodham Clinton over the Republican nominee, Representative Rick A. Lazio. The ad is a response to one by the Republican Leadership Council, a Washington group that helps finance moderate candidates. That ad spliced images of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan against shots of Mr. Lazio, implying that Senator Moynihan, a Democrat, supported Mr. Lazio. Mr. Moynihan unsuccessfully sought the ad to be dropped. It is another example of ads that are paid for with largely unregulated contributions that do not directly solicit votes for individuals but do promote their candidacy.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER Callahan Creative.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN Side-by-side images of Mr. Lazio and Mr. Moynihan walking in slow motion down a corridor followed by shots of Henry VIII, a kangaroo and a bowl of fruit -- and finally former House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- spliced next to Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT ''The Republicans recently aired a commercial superimposing Rick Lazio next to Senator Moynihan suggesting Moynihan supports him. Moynihan wants the ad withdrawn. Using that technique you can make anyone look like they're backing him. Here's Lazio with Henry VIII. With a kangaroo. Look, this bowl of fruit really likes him too. But without faking it, you can tell who got behind Lazio by making him his deputy whip: Newt Gingrich. A message of truth from the New York State Liberal Party. Call Lazio and tell the Republicans to stop.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY Mr. Lazio has said his campaign played no role in the Republican Leadership Council's advertisement. He said he would call on the group and all outside organizations to halt such advertisements, but only if Mrs. Clinton disavows such support, which she has not done. Mr. Lazio indeed forged an alliance with Mr. Gingrich, and voted for most of his Contract With America.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD The approach is meant to ridicule Mr. Lazio's efforts to promote what he considers to be a record of bipartisanship and socially moderate views, both of which are disputed by Mrs. Clinton and her supporters. The advertisement uses Mr. Lazio's association with Mr. Gingrich, an archconservative unpopular in New York, to suggest that Mr. Lazio holds thinly veiled conservative views. But this ad, while tongue in cheek, projects a negative tone that many analysts believe ultimately may turn off voters. And even some Democrats believe Mr. Gingrich's name no longer has much effect with voters.</p>
