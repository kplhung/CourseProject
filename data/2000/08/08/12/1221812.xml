      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival has become a place to see interesting dance in the making, in the relatively informal afternoon performances. That was the case with ''Speaking in Truth: Female Choreographers'' presented on Wednesday afternoon at Lincoln Center plaza.</p>
        <p>Ayodele Casel is a familiar presence on the New York tap scene. Her mentor is Savion Glover, and like him her feet seem to bore into the ground as she dances. Her solo ''Rhythms'' suggested with engaging simplicity how subtly inflected and imaginative that style can be. The fluid way Fred Berryhill's drumming slipped into and out of the dance was another pleasure.</p>

        <p>The Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival has become a place to see interesting dance in the making, in the relatively informal afternoon performances. That was the case with ''Speaking in Truth: Female Choreographers'' presented on Wednesday afternoon at Lincoln Center plaza.</p>
        <p>Ayodele Casel is a familiar presence on the New York tap scene. Her mentor is Savion Glover, and like him her feet seem to bore into the ground as she dances. Her solo ''Rhythms'' suggested with engaging simplicity how subtly inflected and imaginative that style can be. The fluid way Fred Berryhill's drumming slipped into and out of the dance was another pleasure.</p>
        <p>Another highlight was Kerri Edge's stylish ''Prodigy Adventures.'' Ms. Edge addressed police violence against black youths in the two excerpts presented here, but without rhetoric or polemics. Instead she achieved her considerable effect with sleekly stylized soft-edged rock dance performed to rap music by Armando Braswell and a corps of women dressed first in wonderfully simple suggestions of police uniforms and then in hip urban T-shirts and pants. She is clearly a choreographer to watch.</p>
        <p>Cheryl Godineaux's ''Hajj,'' set to percussion played live, was a similarly stylish overlook at African dance, in stage-wide, weaving patterns that were a visual treat. Jamie Philbert's ''Conscious,'' performed to a text written by Jamie Philbert, the choreographer, stood out for the lithe implacable dancing of Shani Collins, another artist one looks forward to seeing more of.</p>
        <p>Hope Boykin's ''Excerpts . . . of Me,'' set to Schubert's ''Ave Maria'' and music by Bill Withers, was busy dance choreographed by the least busy of dancers. It received a strong performance from Camille Brown, Michelle Smith, Brandy Lee and Prince Credell.</p>
        <p>Laila Sales's ''CP Time-Faith,'' danced to Bach, had exquisite costumes, with dresses with crushed-fabric skirts in glowing matte colors. The four dancers -- Romnee Marisa Hayes, Liz Buehlar, Sadira Smith and Karen Nicely -- turned in delicately focused performances. But the meandering piece needed a focus of its own.</p>
        <p>Another disappointment was the sloppiness of the misleading program copy, which suggested a lack of respect for the individual performers that was surprising in Roger C. Jeffrey, one of the savviest and most sensitive of developing young producers on the New York dance scene today.</p>
