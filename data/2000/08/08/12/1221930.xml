        <p>Juan Almonte hit a home run last night as New York beat New Jersey, 2-1, in a round-robin game at the Little League regional championships in Bristol, Conn. It was the third straight victory for the New York team, which is composed of players from the Rolando Paulino Little League in the Bronx. The New Jersey team, from Pequannock, had won its first two games by shutouts.</p>
        <p>New York took a 2-0 lead when Almonte, who pitched a perfect game Wednesday against Delaware, homered in the second inning. New Jersey's Albert Gonzalez singled to drive in Victor Torres an inning later. Danny Almonte pitched a complete game, yielding only two hits and striking out nine.</p>

        <p>Each of the 12 teams in the tournament -- which is divided into Northeast and Middle Atlantic brackets -- plays five games in the round-robin format, which began on Monday. The four teams with the best records from each bracket advance to the quarterfinals on Monday. The semifinals will be Tuesday, with the final scheduled for Thursday night. The winner qualifies for the Little League World Series later this month in Williamsport, Pa.</p>
