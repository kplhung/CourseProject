        <p>With wildfires still burning out of control across a dozen Western states in what may be the worst fire season in a generation, a fierce debate in timber politics has begun to rage over who might be to blame.</p>
        <p>Fire experts had warned for years that a buildup of combustible material in Western forests had reached vast and dangerous proportions. But federal agencies did not begin to address the problem until a policy shift in 1995, and conservative critics -- including the Republican governor of Montana -- were arguing today that, even afterward, the administration did not move fast enough.</p>
        <p>''The Clinton administration didn't cause these fires,'' Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana said in an interview, ''but their policies have left the Forest Service under-funded and under-prepared for this crisis. I don't think it's a conspiracy, but it's a philosophy they have that leads to explosive fires that destroy everything.''</p>
        <p>At the heart of the attack, echoed by representatives of the timber industry, was a contention that the priority given to environmental concerns within the administration had prevented officials from confronting the fire threat as might have been most appropriate, through emergency logging measures.</p>
        <p>Administration officials and their allies were quick to rebut the criticism, suggesting that the critics were speaking mostly out of self-interest, and arguing that the United States Forest Service and other agencies had acted responsibly.</p>
        <p>''It's a campaign year, and these charges are politically motivated,'' Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said in a telephone interview from Colorado.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt conceded that ''some bottlenecks'' had slowed efforts to move ahead with forest-thinning programs and other fire-prevention measures, but he said that the delays did not reflect any lack of administration will.</p>
        <p>Independent fire experts in the West have said that the blazes appear to be following no particular pattern, burning with roughly equal fury in areas that have been logged in the past and those where development has been prohibited. But some said there were indications that the recent use of fire-prevention measures had given some areas an additional margin of protection.</p>
        <p>The finger-pointing hinted at some of the emotions being laid bare in a summer in which fires have already burned more than four million acres of the West, or an area larger than Connecticut. At least 25,000 firefighters are battling the blazes across the region, with reinforcements that include contingents from Australia and New Zealand, as well as from the Army and Marines, who together have dispatched three battalions.</p>
        <p>In Boise, Idaho, the National Interagency Fire Center reported today that the number of large fires in the West had been reduced to 60 from 65.</p>
        <p>But with the hot, dry weather that has fueled the blazes showing no sign of abating, most experts say that some blazes will continue until the first snows, in what is now widely expected to become the worst fire season in at least 30 years.</p>
        <p>The 4.4-million-acre toll for the season so far is nearly double the year-to-date average for the last 10 years, and it outstrips the acreage burned by mid-August in notorious fire years like 1988, when much of Yellowstone National Park burned.</p>
        <p>With this year's fire control costs already above half a billion dollars, and with the Republicans looking for potent issues to help them win the White House, the political debate may well intensify.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview today, Governor Racicot said he had warned officials from the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management since 1992 about the dangers of increased timber buildup. He said he had written as recently as January to the Forest Service chief, Mike Dombeck, to request, in vain, that more timber operations be authorized in Montana's national forests.</p>
        <p>The governor blamed those he called strong environmentalists within the administration, portraying them as opposed to timber cutting under any circumstances, including thinning that might have reduced the severity of the fires.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately, the White House is responsible, just as I am responsible for what happens to our state forests here in Montana,'' said Governor Racicot, who is regarded as a close ally of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>Among others who spoke scathingly today about what they called the administration's mistakes was Michael Klein, the chief spokesman for the American Forest and Paper Association, an industry group with close ties to the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>''It all comes down to not really understanding that to save a forest, you have to cut a tree,'' Mr. Klein said in a telephone interview from the group's headquarters in Washington.</p>
        <p>Since 1989, timber harvests on national forests have fallen to less than 3 billion board feet per year from 12 billion, in large part to address environmental concerns, like threats to endangered species like the spotted owl. That trend, Mr. Klein said, was a sign that ''this administration is in the hands of a radical, environmental fringe that wants to tie the hands of the federal land managers by removing tools from their toolbox.''</p>
        <p>But environmental activists who defended the administration today said they believed that this year's fires had little to do with any shift in logging practices.</p>
        <p>''This is more a phenomenon of the weather than any forest management policy,'' Bob Ekey, regional director of the Wilderness Society, said in a telephone interview from Bozeman, Mont.</p>
        <p>In the broadest sense, all fire experts agree, the main reasons for the current fire-prone state of Western forests must be traced back much further, to the kinds of practices that have been prevalent over the last 100 years. Through nearly all of that period, most fires were suppressed as a matter of federal policy and selective logging of large, commercially valuable trees was widely permitted, creating the conditions that have left most of today's woodlands choked with brush and smaller trees of less quality.</p>
        <p>Before the 20th century, when fires tended to be small and frequent, trees like Ponderosa pines grew in  densities of as little as 20 to 50 trees an acre. Now, in much of the West, the same variety of trees tend to be much smaller but are found in densities that can range from 300 to 900 trees an acre, creating conditions ideal for intense, fast-growing fires.</p>
        <p>In 1995, after a review conducted after the 1994 fire season, the administration formally embraced a Wildland Fire Policy that identified thinning, preventive fires and other steps as key tools toward the goal of trying to assist forests in returning to their natural, less dense state.</p>
        <p>But progress has been slow, in part because of legal challenges and other opposition from environmental groups like the Forest Guardians of Santa Fe, N.M., to practices that they would construe as allowing commercial logging in the national forests.</p>
        <p>In general, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management seem to prefer preventive fires over  cutting in their efforts to thin forests. But public confidence in the man-made fires was dealt a blow in May, when one such fire set near Los Alamos, N.M., swept out of control and destroyed many homes.</p>
        <p>In arguing today that the Clinton administration had failed to take the fire danger seriously enough, some critics pointed to a memorandum written last January by Lester Rosenkrance, who was then director of the Bureau of Land Management's firefighting arm.</p>
        <p>''Should calamity strike, in the form of being unprepared for a severe fire season that results in injuries or deaths among the fire personnel, the agencies will be held accountable,'' Mr. Rosenkrance wrote in the memorandum, which was addressed to Tom Fry, the agency's director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenkrance complained that inadequate financing of the agency's fire presuppression budget requests was leading to insufficient training of federal firefighters, excessive staff reductions and a cutback on the agency's ability to train the firefighters of local governments.</p>
        <p>''There is no doubt in my mind that we are placing the public and property at greater risk as our ability to respond quickly and aggressively to wildland fires decreases,'' Mr. Rosenkrance wrote.</p>
        <p>Senior bureau officials not only ignored his warnings, Mr. Rosenkrance said, but they also asked him to transfer to another job. After more than 30 years with the agency, he chose to retire instead.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Interior Department, which oversees the land management bureau, declined today to discuss Mr. Rosenkrance's retirement. But they said there was no danger of running short of money for fire suppression, in part because Congress had authorized emergency funding and was likely to provide more after the summer recess.</p>
        <p>''One lesson from this summer is that we've got to ask Congress for 100 percent funding of our requests,'' Interior Secretary Babbitt said. ''But we can draw on open-ended funding during the fire season. Money is not an issue.''</p>
