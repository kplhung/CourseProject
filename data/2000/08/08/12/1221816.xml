        <p>Richard Keller Simon, the chairman of humanities at California Polytechnic University and the author of ''Trash Culture,'' has an unusual way of teaching Shakespeare.

        <p>Richard Keller Simon, the chairman of humanities at California Polytechnic University and the author of ''Trash Culture,'' has an unusual way of teaching Shakespeare. In a recent article in The Chronicle of Higher Education titled ''Much Ado About 'Friends': What Pop Culture Offers Literature,'' he outlined his unorthodox method. Following are excerpts:</p>
        <p>The future of literary studies is up for grabs. In his 1998 ''The Rise and Fall of English,'' Robert Scholes expressed the fear that English departments were about to go the way of classics departments, shrinking into insignificance, unless they learned how to change. The answer, I would argue, is hidden in plain sight: on TV and at the movies.</p>
        <p>What our students love, and what we know how to teach, after all, are almost the same. And while this may outrage some literary purists, the future of English departments depends on our ability to link the two kinds of stories.</p>
        <p>The popular television sitcom ''Friends,'' for example, is a contemporary variation on Shakespeare's melodramatic comedy ''Much Ado About Nothing.'' Never mind that the settings are different (Renaissance Italy, contemporary Manhattan), or that one is written in poetry and the other in the language of everyday life. The core characters, plots and themes are almost the same. . . .</p>
        <p>In ''Friends,'' as in ''Much Ado,'' a small group of unmarried young men and women flirt with each other, play a series of tricks on each other and fall in and out of love. Some characters are apprehensive and fearful about marriage and commitment, others more enthusiastic, but all are torn between the conflicting obligations of love and friendship.</p>
        <p>Weddings end in disaster (Rachel's and Ross's, to name only -- five). A man (Chandler) keeps women at a distance with his compulsive joking. Men and women (Ross and Rachel, Chandler and Monica) become romantically involved only when they learn by accident or unplanned confession how much each loves the other. A woman (Rachel) who has been badly hurt by the man she loves (Ross) requires that he suffer in abject humiliation before she will accept him again. A young couple are torn apart by jealousy (Ross, Rachel and the infamous ''break'' in their dating). A woman who is quiet and conventional (Rachel, in the show's first season) slowly begins to gain confidence and, with it, her voice.</p>
        <p>Ross loves Rachel in the first few seasons of the sitcom just as Claudio loves Hero in Shakespeare's comedy. The men are painfully shy, unsure of themselves because of their limited experience with love and sexuality, and more than a little awkward. The women are young, beautiful and gradually getting to understand and accept their qualities beyond that beauty.</p>
        <p>In both cases, the characters are contrasted with their opposites. In Shakespeare, Claudio's comrades are the sexually active and witty Benedick, and Don Pedro, a man expert at wooing women and eager to help his friends. In ''Friends,'' Ross's pals are the sexually active, goofy Joey, who is usually successful with women, and the witty Chandler, who seldom is. Among ''Much Ado's'' women, Hero is complemented by the outspoken, independent Beatrice. In ''Friends,'' Rachel has the outspoken, offbeat Phoebe and the independent Monica.</p>
        <p>Four friends in Shakespeare become six on prime time, but the dynamics among them are similar. Chandler is the sitcom's version of Benedick -- the witty, sarcastic bachelor who keeps himself from getting attached to women by obsessing over their faults. Benedick finally meets his match in the strong and clever Beatrice, who trades jibes with him and ultimately marries him, just as Chandler finally finds Monica. And through it all, Phoebe wanders like a typical Shakespearean fool, making off-the-wall comments and singing wacky songs that contain more than their share of truth.</p>
        <p>In my classes, I grant equal time to ''Much Ado'' and ''Friends,'' even though it means I will have that much less time to devote to some other literary masterpiece. My students love ''Friends.'' . . . The students are more apprehensive about Shakespeare, concerned as they are about the language they must master, the characters to keep straight and the exam looming on the horizon.</p>
        <p>What they most want to talk about and understand is the television program, while what I want to talk about and have them understand is Shakespeare. We meet in the middle.</p>
        <p>I'm not tricking my students. ''Friends'' isn't simply an entree into Shakespeare. Shakespeare is also an entree into ''Friends.'' Shakespeare is the best way for them to fully appreciate something that enchants them and is an important part of their lives. . . .</p>
        <p>After dissecting both works, I ask my students the toughest question I know: Who gets the better story, the Elizabethan who attended a production at the Globe 400 years ago or someone who watches the American sitcom on a regular basis? Are we being cheated today?</p>
        <p>My students are divided on the issue: Some are clearly disappointed in ''Friends,'' say they can watch TV no more and feel distressed at the loss of language in the past 400 years. Others are enchanted by ''Friends'' and say they have recruited others to watch it as well, so impressed are they by the ways in which Shakespeare can be adapted to the demands of contemporary American television. But in either case, I've won a victory: I have shown them that literary criticism is not simply a skill that allows them to get good grades in English courses, and that the great tradition of literature is alive and well, and worth knowing.</p>
