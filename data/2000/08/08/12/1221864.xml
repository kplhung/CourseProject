      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Joseph I. Lieberman, the United States senator who on Monday became Al Gore's vice-presidential running mate, has confirmed his initial preference to continue his Senate re-election campaign, his spokesman said today.</p>
        <p>The decision to stay in the Senate race was made carefully, after discussions with Mr. Gore and other Democratic leaders in Washington and Connecticut, said Dan Gerstein, Mr. Lieberman's press secretary.</p>
        <p>''Senator Lieberman and our campaign staff canvassed the Democratic leadership in the state,'' Mr. Gerstein said, ''and the clear message back was that it was not only acceptable but the appropriate and necessary thing to do.''</p>
        <p>The decision is significant because it means that a Gore-Lieberman victory in November would allow Connecticut's Republican governor,  John G. Rowland, to appoint someone from his own party to fill Mr. Lieberman's Senate seat. Such a move would undermine the drive by Democrats to retake control of the Senate, where they are now a 46-to-54 minority.</p>
        <p>While virtually all Democratic Party leaders have publicly voiced  support for Mr. Lieberman's staying in the Senate campaign, Scott McLean, a political science professor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., said some party members were skeptical.</p>
        <p>''I've talked to some Democrats who question the decision insofar that it signals Lieberman isn't fully confident with the ticket,'' Professor McLean said.</p>
        <p>Under state law, there is still time  -- until Oct. 27 -- for Mr. Lieberman to change his mind, drop out of the Senate race and give another Democrat the opportunity of winning it. Political experts said any of several other Democrats ready to fill the vacancy would probably easily beat Mr. Lieberman's little-known Republican opponent, Phil Giordano, the mayor of Waterbury.</p>
        <p>''Some other Democrats have lamented that if Lieberman leaves, it would still be easy to win against Phil Giordano,'' Professor McLean said. ''Whoever they went for, they would easily beat Giordano.''</p>
        <p>But by committing himself to the Senate, at least for now, Mr. Lieberman, the popular two-term senator, chose the more cautious of two political paths, and the same one previously taken by two prominent Texas Democrats. Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1960, and Lloyd Bentsen, in 1988, also ran simultaneously for vice president and senator.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Lieberman had decided to pull out of the Senate race, figuring another Democrat would win it anyway, he would face the specter of being out of elective office, should he and Mr. Gore lose the presidential election.</p>
        <p>Staying in the Senate race, where Mr. Lieberman is the overwhelming favorite, virtually guarantees that will not happen.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, should Mr. Gore win the White House, Mr. Lieberman would have to sacrifice his valuable Senate seat to a Republican chosen by Mr. Rowland. That person would serve until 2002, when the next statewide elections are held.</p>
        <p>Edward L. Marcus, Connecticut's Democratic Party chairman, said Mr. Lieberman's choice was in the best interests of the party. Without Mr. Lieberman on the Senate ballot, Mr. Marcus said, state Democrats would have to hastily nominate another candidate at a convention, instead of taking the time to hold a primary.</p>
        <p>Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's popular attorney general, was widely regarded as the Democrats' leading prospect to replace Mr. Lieberman. But today, he called Mr. Lieberman's refusal to abandon his Senate campaign ''absolutely the right decision.''</p>
        <p>''Senator Lieberman has been so extraordinarily effective and distinguished in the Senate that I would hate to lose him if the Gore ticket is not successful,'' Mr. Blumenthal said today. ''There is no other way to guarantee that he would be there if he's not vice president.''</p>
        <p>Asked about his own ambitions to work in Washington, Mr. Blumenthal said that ''there will be an opportunity in 2002, if not earlier, to be a candidate for Senate, and I would be very interested in being a candidate.''</p>
        <p>Since Monday, when Mr. Gore chose Mr. Lieberman, the junior Senator from New Haven, to be his running mate, there has been near-constant debate about whether Mr. Lieberman should give up the Senate and put all his efforts into his vice-presidential bid.</p>
        <p>A public-opinion poll taken of 502 state residents this week by the University of Connecticut found that 54 percent believed that Senator Lieberman should not run for both offices, while 37 percent said they would not mind.</p>
        <p>Connecticut Republicans have begun portraying Mr. Lieberman's vow to stay the Senate race as proof that Democrats do not believe they can beat their Republican rival, Texas Governor George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>''It sends a signal nationally that he believes Gore's chances of winning are not good,'' Robert Ward, the minority leader in the state House, told The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerstein of the Lieberman campaign denied any hedging on Mr. Lieberman's part. ''This is in no way a sign of a lack of confidence in the Gore ticket,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Governor Rowland seemed in no hurry to consider the replacement question. Dean Pagani, Mr. Rowland's press secretary, said today that the governor would not contemplate who he might appoint to replace Senator Lieberman until after the November elections.</p>
        <p>''The governor has said he's not going to spend any time thinking about that because he's going to be campaigning for Governor Bush,'' Mr. Pagani said.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Lieberman does stay with his Senate campaign to the very end, no one expects Mr. Giordano to be Mr. Rowland's appointee, said both Douglas Schwartz, director of polling at Quinnipiac University and Mr. McLean, the Quinnipiac professor.</p>
        <p>With no experience orchestrating a high-profile political campaign, Mr. Giordano, 37, is regarded by many people in both parties as unpolished and not particularly ready for prime time.</p>
