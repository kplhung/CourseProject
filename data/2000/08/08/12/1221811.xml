        <p>If it were 1940, ''Autumn in New York,'' a flagrantly old-fashioned, triple-hankie tear-jerker that might have starred Bette Davis and Cary Grant, would probably be lauded as a serious, high-minded romance, the quintessence of ennobling adult entertainment. But time has played nasty tricks on a genre that aims straight for the tear ducts. Nowadays when audiences sense that a movie as shameless as ''Autumn in New York'' intends to ennoble them with tears and redemption, only the most diehard sentimentalists will fail to smell a rat.</p>
        <p>That's probably one reason ''Autumn in New York'' opened yesterday without advance press screenings and despite the public expression of disappointment by its two stars, Richard Gere and Winona Ryder, over the studio's marketing decision. Mr. Gere plays Will Keane, a superstar Manhattan chef and legendary womanizer. Ms. Ryder is Charlotte Fielding, the ailing, doe-eyed young designer of kooky hats who reforms him. Shortly after their affair begins, Charlotte informs Will that she is suffering from an extremely rare and probably terminal heart ailment.</p>

        <p>If it were 1940, ''Autumn in New York,'' a flagrantly old-fashioned, triple-hankie tear-jerker that might have starred Bette Davis and Cary Grant, would probably be lauded as a serious, high-minded romance, the quintessence of ennobling adult entertainment. But time has played nasty tricks on a genre that aims straight for the tear ducts. Nowadays when audiences sense that a movie as shameless as ''Autumn in New York'' intends to ennoble them with tears and redemption, only the most diehard sentimentalists will fail to smell a rat.</p>
        <p>That's probably one reason ''Autumn in New York'' opened yesterday without advance press screenings and despite the public expression of disappointment by its two stars, Richard Gere and Winona Ryder, over the studio's marketing decision. Mr. Gere plays Will Keane, a superstar Manhattan chef and legendary womanizer. Ms. Ryder is Charlotte Fielding, the ailing, doe-eyed young designer of kooky hats who reforms him. Shortly after their affair begins, Charlotte informs Will that she is suffering from an extremely rare and probably terminal heart ailment.</p>
        <p>Talk about medical anomalies! In the classic triple-hankie tradition, Charlotte is the picture of sparkling vitality and fun until she has sudden fainting spells (always at crucial dramatic moments and at picturesque locations like the ice rink at Rockefeller Center). She also has an improbably stiff upper lip. Although there's a small chance her life could be saved through a risky operation (she has less than a year to live), she refuses to have it because she doesn't want to entertain false hope.</p>
        <p>Much is made of the fact that Will is twice Charlotte's age. He's (gasp!) 48 to her 22, something that is repeatedly pounded home by Will's bartender John (Anthony LaPaglia). One of the movie's two official scolds, John warns Will that if he goes on like this, he might end up, God forbid, dying in his own arms.</p>
        <p>John's dire warnings are raspingly seconded by Charlotte's crusty old grandmother and official guardian,  Dolly (Elaine Stritch). Both of Charlotte's parents died in a mysterious accident many years earlier. Way, way back in the 1960's, we learn, Will actually dated Charlotte's mother. But such is the movie's prim sense of propriety that the screenplay goes out of its way to let us know that Will never actually had sex with the woman. Will was supposedly a true child of the 60's whose favorite singer was (you'll never guess!) Stephen Stills. When the name is dropped, Charlotte draws a blank.</p>
        <p>''Autumn in New York'' once and for all certifies Mr. Gere as a romantic ''older man'' in the mode of the 1950's and 60's Cary Grant. In fact, the two have much in common. Both exude an unflappable suavity under which percolates a hidden, enigmatic sexuality. But unlike Grant's typical romantic heroes, who were vaguely upper-class and vaguely British, Mr. Gere's Will has the slightly roguish air of the self-made newly rich man up from the streets.</p>
        <p>With her high-strung energy and saucer-eyed precocity, Ms. Ryder's Charlotte is upper-middle-class all the way. The chemistry between these two is less than scintillating. But in their best moments together, Mr. Gere sheds his wariness to express a sad world-weary tenderness, while Ms. Ryder's slightly shrill, pouty bravado melts, and her frightened doe eyes appear caught in metaphysical headlights.</p>
        <p>If the movie, directed by Joan Chen, exhibits a loving eye for Manhattan exteriors, it's undone by its own rigidly old-fashioned conventions. Allison Burnett's screenplay does a creditable job of filling out the characters (Charlotte's a blunt truth-teller and Will a sneaky and evasive liar), and depicting their love affair, which Will blithely sabotages more than once. But the movie's tentative psychological realism clashes lethally with its soft-focused medical vagueness and refusal to confront the physical realities of illness. Today we know too much about the body to accept the notion embraced by ''Autumn in New York'' that dying makes you more beautiful by giving you a heavenly glow.</p>
        <p>''Autumn in New York'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).  It has sexual situations.</p>
