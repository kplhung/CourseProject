        <p>In recent years the issue of reparations has exploded among nations wrestling with the past. Scholars are beginning to see the German payout of $60 billion to Jewish victims of the Holocaust, the United States decision to pay reparations to Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II and even Japan's awkward efforts to settle with Korean ''comfort women'' as bedrocks of a new political landscape.</p>
        <p>Elazar Barkan, the chairman of the cultural studies department at Claremont Graduate University in California, contends that since the end of the cold war, the West in particular has entered a neo-Enlightenment period of political morality in which restitution increasingly plays a leading role. Political language has shifted, he writes in ''The Guilt of Nations''(W.W. Norton), from machtpolitik, the politics of power, to a shared belief among nations in the rights of individuals and groups.</p>
        <p>Consent and cooperation have become the buzzwords of global relations, Mr. Barkan says, and agreement is now being achieved through negotiation rather than force. ''Certainly the eagerness of leaders -- Clinton, Blair, Chirac, the pope -- to atone has been mocked,'' he said during a telephone interview. ''But there is a growing sense that you have to do the right thing.''</p>
        <p>In this new era, Mr. Barkan and others argue, the issue of American reparations for slavery -- straitjacketed for decades in a kind of intellectual Bedlam -- is beginning to look sane. ''For so long it was just ludicrous for black folk to even bring up the notion that they might be entitled to some just compensation,'' said Michael Eric Dyson, the Ida B. Wells Barnett professor of religious studies at De Paul University in Chicago. ''It was simply crazy.'' But after so many successful reparations campaigns, including those for economic and cultural restitution to various American Indian tribes, the African-American case has gained momentum.</p>
        <p>Every year since 1989, Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, has sponsored a bill to establish a commission to study reparations for slavery. It remains stuck in committee, but away from Capitol Hill other developments are having a significant impact on the national debate.</p>
        <p>Black intellectuals like Randall Robinson, the president of TransAfrica, a lobbying group, and the author of ''The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks,'' and the Harvard University professors Charles T. Ogletree and Henry Louis Gates Jr. have publicly supported reparations. Individual cities and towns are confronting their racist pasts: some, like Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Dallas, support Federal hearings on reparations while others, like Tulsa, Okla., Rosewood, Fla., and Elaine, Ark., are either considering or are paying monetary damages for past atrocities. As Mr. Dyson explains, ''African-Americans themselves are beginning to be politicized around this debate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barkan writes that slavery remains ''the most glaring example of an unaddressed historical injustice in the United States.'' He adds that this ''stands in direct contrast with the public culture that embraces the concept of attempting to redress its imperfect past.''</p>
        <p>But opponents of reparations commonly argue that other examples of past imperfection are redressable in ways that slavery is not. In the case of the Japanese-Americans, the victims themselves were compensated for quantifiable, provable suffering at the hands of an identifiable perpetrator, the United States Government. With the descendants of slaves, this argument goes, the situation is entirely different.</p>
        <p>It is, first of all, said to be impossible to determine the actual present-day effect of slavery -- to trace the impact of slavery on, for example, today's overwhelming incarceration rate among black males, or to calculate all those generations of lost or artificially depressed wages. Not to mention the quagmire of determining who should be compensated. All blacks? Only those who demonstrate direct linkage to a slave? Should those of mixed race be included? Or what about Oprah?</p>
        <p>Supporters of reparations find this line of argument irrelevant. ''The way I look at historical crimes or historical injustices is do the victims still suffer, whether it is the victim or the victim's descendants,'' Mr. Barkan says. ''Another issue that's been raised is, 'Why should I pay for it, I didn't do it?' It is a foolish argument. No one is responsible personally for any wrongdoing. But just to stop the action doesn't mean to have paid for the past. The perpetrator is very clear. It's the identity of the U.S. The U.S. as an entity is responsible.''</p>
        <p>Scott L. Malcomson, the author of the forthcoming ''One Drop of Blood: The American Misadventure of Race'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux) points out that whites have been distancing themselves from moral culpability for slavery since as far back as the Revolutionary period. Thomas Jefferson, for instance, argued that it was the British who were to blame. Even so, many abolitionists at the time supported their own form of reparations: the establishment of a colony in Africa for freed slaves.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Barkan writes in ''The Guilt of Nations'' that national identity is a result of history, ''for better and for worse,'' and therefore we ''should pay our historical debts,'' Wendy Kaminer, a fellow at the Radcliffe Public Policy Center, recently argued the opposite point. Writing in American Prospect magazine, she said that the campaign for reparations ''reflects some of the premises of the aristocracy it attacks.'' She continued: ''It allows the past to define our entitlements in the present; it relies on a belief in the justice of inheritance. . . . If equality is a birthright, you don't have to purchase it with the sufferings of your ancestors, any more than you should be able to purchase privileges with your ancestors' achievements.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, just how the past should be used is at the crux of the debate. Ian Buruma, who has written extensively about the legacies of World War II, contends that the quest for reparations tends to mire the petitioners in the very victimization for which they seek payment, as well as encouraging a never-ending flood of restitution-seekers. ''If every group that feels a historical wrong wants compensation, how far back do you go?'' he asked in an interview. ''It becomes problematic.''</p>
        <p>As ethnic groups in the United States and elsewhere have assimilated, Mr. Buruma went on, they have tended to replace their cultural identities with the residue of past discrimination. This leads, in his view, to resentment, which undermines the possibility of mutual understanding between groups.</p>
        <p>''Instead of identifying as an American entitled to freedoms and rights and all men created equal,'' he said of African-Americans seeking reparations, ''you are born into an aggrieved group deserving compensation. Then that's your whole identity and you can never get out of it.''</p>
        <p>For some, the argument against reparations is simply that any kind of compensation would be wholly inappropriate and inadequate recompense, not just for slavery but also for the entire array of racial injustices that trailed in slavery's wake. As the sociologist Glenn C. Loury wrote recently in The New York Times: ''Who can say what the out-of-wedlock birth rate for blacks would be, absent chattel slavery? How does one calculate the cost of inner-city ghettos, of poor education, of the stigma of perceived racial inferiority? The severity of slavery's 'injury' is far more profound than any cash transfer will be able to reverse.''</p>
        <p>But for proponents, the word reparations can cover a host of interventions, from cash payments -- the current equivalent of, say, 40 acres and a mule -- to a direct, official apology from the President. Some argue that affirmative action policies already in place should be considered sufficient, though Mr. Barkan responds that affirmative action aims at fixing present injustices rather than compensating for past ones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson and Mr. Ogletree, among others, have suggested that reparations be used to finance social and economic development programs for the benefit of all black Americans. In another development, a lawyer named Deadria Farmer-Paellmann is compiling evidence for lawsuits against a dozen companies that she says demonstrably benefited from the slave trade. Among them are Providence Bank, a precursor of the FleetBoston Financial Corporation, and the Aetna Insurance Company of Hartford.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, though, many proponents of reparations see the issue as a moral one that cannot be dismissed because the practicalities seem byzantine at the moment. ''I think it's part of the social contract of justice in America,'' Mr. Dyson said, ''that if black people have done what they've done and have been treated the way they've been treated, then they deserve what they deserve. And we can argue about what that dessert should look like, but it ain't come yet.''</p>
