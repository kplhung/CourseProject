        <p>Trebly post-rock, the recherche decadence of Britpop, new American ruralism, electroshock metal, dirty novelty songs on MP3 -- O.K., the fashions keep changing. But among all these shiny new models, what's going to happen to the American bar band, the dependable Buick at the back of the lot?</p>
        <p>Johnny Society, a New York band toughing it out in the dives, exemplified the problem when it played at Brownies on Thursday night. What will it take for this trio to break out beyond its little audience? Controversial lyrics? Silver pants? A human beatbox? A less purposefully generic name? Who knows?</p>

        <p>Trebly post-rock, the recherche decadence of Britpop, new American ruralism, electroshock metal, dirty novelty songs on MP3 -- O.K., the fashions keep changing. But among all these shiny new models, what's going to happen to the American bar band, the dependable Buick at the back of the lot?</p>
        <p>Johnny Society, a New York band toughing it out in the dives, exemplified the problem when it played at Brownies on Thursday night. What will it take for this trio to break out beyond its little audience? Controversial lyrics? Silver pants? A human beatbox? A less purposefully generic name? Who knows?</p>
        <p>The band is led by Kenny Siegal, a prolific maker of clomping three-minute pop songs with fast-action emotional wallops. He's learned his craft: shifting between major and minor, he uses music and lyrics to illustrate moods of indecision in the verses and bitter declarations in the choruses. The persona in his songs -- let's call him Johnny Society, a Kafkaesque figure, sort of Joseph K. in training -- retreats from everything that confuses him (self-doubt, information overload, sexual betrayal) but isn't compelled to lie down and go catatonic. Instead, he hammers on basic issues of acting civil, like someone morally betrayed as a Boy Scout.</p>
        <p>Among the least tangled of his imagistic lyrics in Thursday night's set were ''Charity! Charity! Forget your money!'' In another, ''I'm not gonna stand for the reign of mediocrity -- no one can reach me!'' In another, ''How do you tell anymore what is home and what is hell? Tell, do you believe in free will?'' His voice, hardened, howling, tightly on pitch and unafraid of a detailed melody, matches his heavy-handed but skillful guitar playing; there's something basically familiar about what he does, probably because his is a neat cross between John Fogerty in Creedence Clearwater Revival and Paul McCartney as an anguished rocker in the late Beatles.</p>
        <p>Shifting between guitar and overdriven electric piano, on which he had a bashing, earthy R&amp;B touch, Mr. Siegal and his band ran through about 10 songs in a little over an hour, half of them from Johnny Society's new album, ''Clairvoyance'' (Messenger), helped out a few times by a blues-harmonica player who came up to jam. It was the highest end of the bar-band art -- these were tough, curious little songs, yet no big thing. They don't impel the audience to change its life and get a new wardrobe.</p>
