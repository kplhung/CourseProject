        <p>Editorial on recent attacks against foreigners in Germany holds that one of main challenges facing German society and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's government is nation's need to be more welcoming to immigrants</p>

        <p>A bomb apparently targeted at foreigners went off at a Dusseldorf train station recently, injuring nine immigrants, six of them Jews, as they returned home from a German-language class. A few days later, with great fanfare, a 25-year-old Indonesian software specialist became the first recipient of a new visa Germany plans to give to foreigners with computer skills. The juxtaposition underscored one of the main challenges facing German society and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's government -- the nation's need to be more welcoming to immigrants.</p>
        <p>The Dusseldorf bombing, along with a rash of other attacks on foreigners, has provoked much soul-searching. Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of the Green Party urged Germans to speak out against skinhead and neo-Nazi violence, lest the perpetrators believe they are acting on behalf of a silent majority.</p>
        <p>Beyond the moral imperative, an attitudinal change toward immigration has become a matter of economic necessity. Where Germany once grudgingly allowed in millions of guest workers, mostly Turks, to do menial jobs, the nation's high-technology industries must now rely on skilled foreigners in order to remain competitive in the world market.  The Federation of German Employers says that the nation lacks as many as 1.5 million skilled workers. Last year Chancellor Schroder pushed through a reform of citizenship laws that had enshrined the principle that immigrants in Germany, as well as their descendants, should forever remain foreigners. Now the children of guest workers born on German soil may acquire German citizenship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroder's Social Democratic Party paid a heavy price for championing this sensible reform, dampening its enthusiasm to take further pro-immigration stands. But the political atmosphere is changing. The growing sense of shame at the rash of attacks on foreigners coincides with a realization that Germany will become increasingly reliant on immigrants.</p>
        <p>There is a common misperception that Germany is a nation overcrowded by immigrants. According to a government report, the net population gain due to immigration last year was 202,000. But because of the country's low birth rate, even if that number were maintained every year, Germany would still lose 15 percent of its population by 2050. Germany's social insurance programs face an ever-shrinking pool of workers subsidizing retirees' benefits. It should be clear to all Germans that immigration is vital to the nation's health.</p>
