        <p>Michael Ouellette lives in an illegal room in Manhattan. His cell-like home of 8 feet by 13 feet has no window for light and air, as required by New York City statute. Two other rented rooms are also windowless, and he disputes the legality of three more.</p>
        <p>Missing windows are not the only problem. In fact, Mr. Ouellette contends that the whole building is operating outside the law. There is no certificate of occupancy, a required city document authorizing the use of a building. And in June, a city buildings inspector issued a ''hazardous violation'' citing the property as an illegal single-room-occupancy hotel.</p>
        <p>''The entire building is illegal,'' said Mr. Ouellette (pronounced oh-LET), 38, who sells and services computers. ''I want it 100 percent compliant.''</p>
        <p>But it is a Catch-22. The management says that compliance will force his eviction.</p>
        <p>Among New York's 900,000 buildings, this one is not big, famous or historically notable. It is far from the worst building on the city's radar screen. But it shows how a troubled building can slip through the regulatory cracks for decades. Tenant advocates say that a bewildering morass of city codes, inspection practices and enforcement policies too often perpetuate problems rather than solve them.</p>
        <p>The building, at 77 East 125th Street, has a convoluted history of continued operation despite uncorrected violations and the lack of a certificate. It dates to the 1870's, when it was built as a three-family house. Decades ago -- no one seems to know exactly when -- it was converted into a rooming house. Its 17 rooms rent for $125 to $150 a week, including utilities.</p>
        <p>For at least 36 years, city officials have known about its improperly subdivided rooms. Inspectors issued a violation in 1964 and ordered the owner to correct it and to obtain a certificate of occupancy. But apparently the city never enforced the regulations, and a succession of landlords never complied.</p>
        <p>The city did close the building in 1995, but for hazardous violations other than the illegal rooms without windows. At that time, inspectors cited defective fire sprinklers, no gas, no water, no heat and no lights in the halls and stairway.</p>
        <p>The building was declared ''dangerous to life and detrimental to the health and safety of the occupants and others and unfit for human habitation.'' The city issued a ''full vacate order,'' removed the tenants to temporary lodging and gated the entrance. The owner was forbidden to reopen without a certificate of occupancy.</p>
        <p>Ignoring that order, the manager made repairs and the building resumed operations in 1997, sans certificate. It has continued ever since, even after inspectors returned to issued still more violations.</p>
        <p>How could such a situation continue? Critics say that the city issues myriad violations with little or no follow-up to force compliance and collect fines. Budget cuts have reduced the inspection staff by a third in the last decade, and tenant advocates complain that city enforcement lawyers are also shorthanded.</p>
        <p>With limited resources, city lawyers focus on ''comprehensive cases''; every year cracking down on a few hundred buildings with the most flagrant violations.</p>
        <p>''You see it all the time,'' said Peggy Earisman, managing attorney of the East Side S.R.O. Law Project, a nonprofit group. ''There are violations that are open for years, with 400 violations on some buildings. Surely if these laws have any meaning, their purpose is to protect the health and safety of people.''</p>
        <p>The president of the Allied Building Inspectors Union Local 211, Joseph M. Corso, said, ''We could have thousands of inspectors, but if there's no follow-up litigation, it's useless.''</p>
        <p>Since reopening, 77 East 125th Street has assumed an upscale name, the Renaissance Hostel. Advertisements in The Village Voice stress its location between Madison and Park Avenues and its newly renovated rooms and international environment. But the ramshackle four-story structure lacks some features considered common even before the Renaissance.</p>
        <p>For example, the first thing a visitor notices about the building is the front entrance doorknob. There isn't one. The missing knob was duly noted by inspectors and cited as a violation a year ago, so far to no avail.</p>
        <p>On the ground floor is a storefront padlocked in a police raid last November. Until June, bright yellow and orange police posters in the window proclaimed: ''Closed by court order. Criminal sale and possession of marijuana.'' Now a new sign heralds a soon-to-open clothes shop.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, the entire building was overrun with illicit drugs and prostitution, according to the current manager, Andrew Haurylkiewicz (pronounced harry-KEV-ick).</p>
        <p>When he took over, Mr. Haurylkiewicz arranged major repairs of the sprinkler, plumbing and heating systems and reopened the building. But problems persisted, including the lack of a certificate and other uncorrected violations. Several thousand dollars in past fines were ignored. Also unpaid was a $61,000 city lien for the cost of moving the tenants in 1995 and putting them up in hotels.</p>
        <p>Prodded by Mr. Ouellette, inspectors from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development returned in recent months. They issued new citations for the certificate of occupancy, illegal rooms, a defective sprinkler, rusty fire escapes, loose chimney bricks and the failure to post an inspection certificate near mailboxes. Not only was there no posting; there were no mailboxes.</p>
        <p>The case also drew a fresh Buildings Department review. In June, the department ordered the owner either to restore the original three-family floor plan or to obtain a permit for a different use that conforms to code. The windowless rooms would have to be restored as alcoves to other rooms that have windows. At a hearing on Aug. 3, the landlord did not show up and was declared in default.</p>
        <p>The result of all this? The building's legal status is in bureaucratic limbo, with the violations, fines and lien still pending, yet the building continues to rent rooms by the week.</p>
        <p>The owner denies responsibility. ''We're hands off,'' said Sharock Jacoby of Great Neck, president of Ashan Realty. It leases the property to Mr. Haurylkiewicz's firm, Newkirk Realty, under a contract obliging Newkirk to correct violations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haurylkiewicz said he inherited the problems and was doing his best to remedy them. But he said he was going broke from the repairs and lawyers' fees, totaling $30,000 to date. He is also being squeezed by a rent strike led by Mr. Ouellette, with 10 tenants withholding $1,350 a week and the arrears approaching $30,000, Mr. Haurylkiewicz said. ''I'm running out of money,'' he said. ''I'm drowning.''</p>
        <p>Because some city documents listed 18 dwellings in the building, Mr. Haurylkiewicz said he had initially assumed they were legal. Now he agrees that the windowless rooms violate the housing code, and he vows to fix them. But he said that the renovations planned by his architect would require Mr. Ouellette's removal so his room could be opened to the adjoining room, which has a window.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the city housing agency said it was issuing an order that two windowless rooms in the building, including Mr. Ouellette's, be vacated by Monday for lack of ventilation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ouellette refuses to budge, asserting that since he has been there longer, his neighbor is the one who should move out. Why does Mr. Ouellette stay in his cramped space? ''My mission is to legalize the building,'' he said. But Mr. Haurylkiewicz said that the real attraction for Mr. Ouellette was living rent-free and avoiding electric bills for all his computer equipment.</p>
        <p>Management's dispute with Mr. Ouellette runs deep. Both sides have hurled bitter accusations of vandalism, harassment and assault. There are court orders of protection and a mound of unresolved litigation over rent, repairs and eviction.</p>
        <p>Whatever the truth of the charges and outcome of the cases, government records detail the building's legal woes. There are unpaid fines for lack of heat last winter and for failing to post boiler inspection certificates. Other violations over the years included exposed electrical wires, a defective fire escape ladder, broken plaster and water and sewage leaks. The rent roll, required to be submitted annually, was filed only once before 1995.</p>
        <p>Despite such problems, the city's housing and buildings agencies said that conditions at the Renaissance were far from the worst. (Both agencies inspect structures but for different rules.)</p>
        <p>A recent tour found the interior dingy and run down. The wooden stairs were uneven and springy. The apartment doors were unfinished wood. Each floor had one common bathroom. Some had new tiling, but there were also cracks in the walls. Water dripped from bulging ceiling plaster and leaked around a toilet, each sink and vanity teetered, medicine cabinet doors did not close and sooty black mold covered one patch of wall. The communal kitchen had no chair. Plastic sheets covered much of the roof to keep out rain.</p>
        <p>Missing mail is a big complaint. ''Anything important I have sent to my ex-wife's house,'' said one tenant, Murray Pessin. Another issue is the lack of intercoms and buzzers. ''I can't hear the doorbell downstairs,'' Mr. Pessin said, ''and even if I could, I wouldn't know who it was for.''</p>
        <p>Another resident, Brett Faison, said he was hit by a chunk of plaster. ''I told them two weeks prior it was about to fall, and it did.'' Like Mr. Ouellette, he lives in a windowless room. ''It's a little inhumane,'' he said.</p>
