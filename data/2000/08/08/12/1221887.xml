        <p>The Liberty has no love lost for the Washington Mystics. Just games lost.</p>
        <p>The Mystics have taken five of seven from the Liberty in the last two seasons, two of three this year. That record is one reason the rivalry has been intensely personal, with players fueling their frustrations with postgame jabs.</p>
        <p>''In the beginning we were very angry about losing to them,'' the Liberty veteran Sue Wicks said. ''But now that's kind of subsided.''</p>
        <p>When the two teams meet tonight in Washington to begin the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs of the Women's National Basketball Association, the rivalry may be less personal, but it will certainly be more intense.</p>
        <p>''Washington has given us fits over the season,'' Wicks said.</p>
        <p>The Liberty, making its third playoff appearance in four years, owns the best record in the East, 20-12. The Mystics are in the playoffs for the first time in their three years of existence, with a 14-18 record. No matter.</p>
        <p>''They know us very well,'' Wicks said. ''Whoever fights harder will win. Even though their record doesn't show it, we treat them as one of the elite.''</p>
        <p>Chamique Holdsclaw, the Mystics' All-Star forward, said she thinks her team's record does show something, though.</p>
        <p>''We haven't been as successful as the New York team, and to have more victories against them in the regular season, that says a lot,'' said Holdsclaw, who grew up in Queens.</p>
        <p>Holdsclaw disagrees with Wicks about the current state of the rivalry. ''I think it's still pretty personal,'' she said.</p>
        <p>It was probably no coincidence that the Liberty's lone victory over Washington this year came three games after the Mystics' head coach, Nancy Darsch, resigned. After a disappointing 9-11 start, she was replaced by an interim coach, Darrell Walker.</p>
        <p>Darsch had coached the Liberty in its first two seasons and was dismissed in 1998, after New York missed making the playoffs by losing its final game against Detroit. New York players generally were not sorry to see her go.</p>
        <p>''Wanting to play so well against her, it really took the focus off playing our game,'' Liberty forward Vickie Johnson said. ''You try to show your ex-coach that you're a good team, despite what she felt in the past.''</p>
        <p>After the teams' first meeting this season, a 79-67 Mystics victory in Washington on June 4, Liberty players said they heard Darsch on the sideline telling her players to ''kill 'em,'' referring to New York. Darsch flatly denied saying that, but the Liberty took exception to her decision to keep her starters in the game even after Washington had built a large lead.</p>
        <p>The hard feelings remained in the second meeting this season, when Holdsclaw hit a game-winning jump shot in Madison Square Garden. Her last-second shot was a dagger from a player who had said that she and the Mystics never earned respect from New York.</p>
        <p>The third meeting this season produced a change in both teams. Walker had just taken over as interim coach, just as he had for the Washington Wizards last season. Despite Walker's emphasis on tougher defense and an up-tempo style, the Liberty won that game in Washington, 78-64, and New York's players admitted they felt better without Darsch there.</p>
        <p>''We were more relaxed and more comfortable in our offense and schemes,'' Johnson said. ''We were playing our style of basketball.''</p>
        <p>In the first half of the season, when New York lost twice to Washington, the Liberty was struggling with injuries and conditioning; the Liberty also needed to integrate its new player, Tari Phillips, into the team. New York was 7-9 in the first half.</p>
        <p>''Earlier we hadn't jelled yet,'' Wicks said. ''But Tari is a true Liberty now. We've never had a superstar before.''</p>
        <p>Phillips was named an All-Star, along with Wicks. Phillips, a 6-foot-2 center, has led the Liberty in scoring, with 13.8 points a game, helping her team finish the season by winning 13 of its final 16 games.</p>
        <p>New York lost its last regular-season game, 66-63, to Detroit, when Phillips was suffering from a pulled hamstring. She did not practice yesterday, but will be able to start tonight, Coach Richie Adubato said.</p>
        <p>The series shifts to Madison Square Garden for Game 2 on Monday. Game 3, if necessary, will be played Tuesday at the Garden.</p>
