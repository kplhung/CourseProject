        <p>A federal appeals court has reversed a $50,000 sanction against a Manhattan lawyer for his conduct during a civil trial last year, finding that the lawyer's behavior did not justify the penalty.</p>
        <p>After the trial, which involved a  battle over a legal bill, Judge Denny Chin of the United States District Court found the behavior of one lawyer, Judd Burstein, so improper that he ordered Mr. Burstein to pay the heavy fine. The judge's decision drew attention to the sometimes delicate task that trial lawyers have of representing their clients zealously while staying within the bounds of proper behavior.</p>
        <p>Judge Chin found that Mr. Burstein had ''engaged in offensive, demeaning and abusive conduct,'' according to the appeals court decision. The judge itemized 11 tactics that he found ''offensive and overly aggressive,'' including writing a letter to the opposing lawyer ''threatening to 'tarnish' his reputation and subject him to the 'legal equivalent of a proctology exam,' '' the court wrote.</p>
        <p>But when the appeals panel reviewed Mr. Burstein's conduct, including the letter, it found that the sanction was not justified.</p>
        <p>''Plainly the hostile tenor of this litigation gelled with Burstein's letter's reference to the legal equivalent of a 'proctology exam,' '' the appeals panel wrote. ''Yet it is difficult to conclude that the letter constitutes grounds for sanctions.''</p>
        <p>The appeals panel wrote that the reference was ''reflective of a general decline in the decorum level of even polite public discourse.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burstein, who has written to Judge Chin requesting a public apology, said yesterday that he had sought only to represent his client aggressively and had never strayed beyond the proper conduct for a lawyer.</p>
        <p>''The attorney who is doing his job the way it is supposed to be done is pushing the envelope as hard as he possibly can,'' Mr. Burstein said. ''Judge Chin and I obviously have very different views about the size of the envelope, and it appears my view is the correct one.''</p>
