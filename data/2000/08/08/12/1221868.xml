        <p>Just over the ridge from the handsome homes and sloping lawns, the old marble quarry churns away as it has since the early 1900's, producing ornamental stones and pebbles, powdered limestone fertilizer and ingredients for floor tiles, caulks and paints, abrasive cleaners, bowling balls and golf ball covers.</p>
        <p>The quarry also spews a fine grayish-white dust into the air. For decades, old-timers say, few in this small town in the woods of northwestern New Jersey worried about it. But in the last 18 months or so, complaints have popped up from some residents in Sussex Mills, a development just 10 years old with a few dozen homes across a hillside from the quarry.</p>
        <p>The collision of affluent new homeowners and an old industry started with the usual Nimby complaints about the quarry's noise and dust. But annoyance has deepened to anxiety. Some of the newcomers now fear that the dust contains tremolite, a microscopic asbestos fiber that can cause lung cancer and other potentially fatal diseases.</p>
        <p>The substance made headlines in recent months with the revelation of hundreds of deaths and respiratory illnesses from exposure to tremolite from a mine in Libby, Mont. Federal officials call the mine, which was closed in 1990, the biggest single source of asbestos exposure in the nation's history.</p>
        <p>The situation in Sparta is far murkier, with dueling scientific reports about the presence of tremolite fibers, debate about conflicting state and federal standards of measurement, and different attitudes among newcomers and old-timers here. While feelings run high, resolution seems months away. After four months of internal debate, the state said today that by October it would start inspecting the air and homes near the quarry and evaluate health risks posed by any fibers. The process may take up to 14 months.</p>
        <p>The state's announcement came after sharp criticism of its initial plan to measure the fibers. Some doctors who specialize in occupational health contended in recent interviews that the state's first testing standards were flawed and would not detect larger fibers that have been linked to lung cancer elsewhere. The state agreed today to also use a broader standard, used for years to protect miners and quarry workers.</p>
        <p>The delays and uncertainty have frustrated those who see danger in the quarry dust, and have divided this town of 17,000. Many regard the newcomers as alarmists threatening the well-being of Sparta's biggest taxpayer and one of its largest employers. Formerly known as the Lime Crest Quarry, it is now called the Southdown Quarry.</p>
        <p>''We've been shunned,'' said Claire Cifelli, one of three women in Sussex Mills who teamed up with neighbors to push state and federal officials to investigate the quarry. ''They think we're out of our minds. There are a lot of people who don't want to hear about it. They're interested in their property values. I don't want to drive anyone out of business. I just want the truth to come out.''</p>
        <p>The squabbling here is being closely watched across the state line in Warwick, N.Y. -- like Sparta, a growing suburb in the countryside some 60 miles from Manhattan -- where the owner of a defunct marble quarry  wants to reopen it. Since the quarry closed in 1983, a golf course, new homes and a school have been built nearby. Its foes, fearing the presence of tremolite in the marble, have asked Warwick town officials to rezone the quarry land as agricultural, thus banning mining.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to stop a problem before it gets started,'' said Debra Holton-Smith, a leader of the opposition group in Orange County, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Warwick and Sparta sit atop a billion-year-old formation of the minerals dolomite and calcite. Mining for limestone and marble started in the late 1800's. In the past, the 35-mile formation has also yielded zinc and chunks of rare fluorescent minerals on display at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. Around the turn of the century, Thomas A. Edison operated an iron ore mine in Sparta and, according to local legend, helped develop the marble quarry.</p>
        <p>Dust has apparently come from the quarry for years, say older residents, who are nevertheless unconcerned. Since Mary Elinor Eppler, 80, moved into her home here in the 1950's, she has been wiping up -- but not worrying about -- the dust that drifts from the quarry about a half mile away, she said. ''It's all over my house,'' Mrs. Eppler said, bringing up traces of dull white residue as she ran her fingertips along a windowsill and coffee table. ''I've been living with this gray dust for 47 1/2 years, and I'm not sick. You can stop at any house up here, and they'll say, 'What are they talking about?' ''</p>
        <p>But the quarry's opponents in affluent Sussex Mills think otherwise. Donna Rubin, one of three women leading the opposition, said visible airborne dust was alien to her even in Brooklyn, where she used to live. Ms. Rubin now dusts her furniture with a wet cloth to keep the particles from floating into the air. She uses motorized air filters  in the kitchen, family room and three bedrooms. On windy days, she tries to keep her two daughters, ages 5 and 11, indoors. ''Sometimes I think I'm crazy for staying here,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The third woman leading the quarry battle here, Gay Corbin, said two of her sons developed pneumonia and her two other sons had sinus infections since she and her husband came to Sussex Mills from Mount Olive, N.J., four and a half years ago. Ms. Corbin says she is allergic to dust and has had pneumonia three times. She is convinced the illnesses were caused by quarry dust.</p>
        <p>The owner of the quarry, Southdown Inc. of Houston, agrees that the dust is excessive and says it has a plan to reduce it. Southdown has acknowledged that the marble contains a form of tremolite, said Alan Bowen, director of the company's mineral division. But Mr. Bowen said the tremolite was not the fibrous variety and was not a health threat.</p>
        <p>Many in town defend the quarry, which employs 85 to 100, depending on production schedules, and is Sparta's largest taxpayer. ''If they ever put the quarry issue to a vote,'' said Leonard Peck, 90, a 30-year resident, ''probably 85 percent of the people would say it doesn't bother them and it doesn't affect them.''</p>
        <p>Concern seems to depend on where one lives. Ken Johnson, 35, a 35-year-old writer who moved here from Manhattan, said he considered buying a home in Sussex Mills until the real estate agent mentioned the nearby quarry. So he bought on the other side of town, where he said his neighbors never discuss the dust.</p>
        <p>But Sussex Mills is buzzing.</p>
        <p>The three women leading the fight learned early last year about a state geologist's findings in the early 1980's that tremolite existed in the quarry's marble and in discharge water flowing into a creek. The geologist, Mark Germine, said state officials showed little concern.</p>
        <p>Last summer, the women said, they asked the State Department of Environmental Protection to intervene and when that appeal was fruitless they traveled to Washington and sought help from the Environmental Protection Agency. Soon after, state officials told Southdown to examine three quarry smokestacks. Last September, a consultant for Southdown reported finding tremolite fibers; the state agency reviewed the emission data and confirmed the findings. But then Southdown hired a second consultant, Eric J. Chatfield, an asbestos specialist now helping the E.P.A with the Libby investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chatfield said last fall that Southdown's original analysis was flawed and argued that no tremolite fibers had come from the stacks, Mr. Bowen said. After the Chatfield report, the state and Southdown agreed to disagree until New Jersey tests the air and dust at the quarry and in scores of homes within two miles.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Department  sued in February to shut the quarry. But its lawsuit made no mention of  asbestos or tremolite, instead accusing the quarry of polluting the air  with illegal discharges of undefined dust and particles. A State Superior Court judge refused to close the quarry and ordered the state and Southdown to negotiate a settlement.</p>
        <p>In an agreement announced on June 30, Southdown was fined $246,350 for violations of state and federal air pollution laws and regulations and required to carry out a dust-management plan. The plan is to include installing monitoring devices and paving dirt roads, and will cost about $700,000, Mr. Bowen said.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, quarry foes have waited with increasing impatience for the start of the state's testing.</p>
        <p>''Everything is delay, delay, delay,'' said Dr. Melvin Van Woert, an internist at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan who lives in Sussex Mills. ''A single fiber in the air could cause cancer 10, 20, 30 years from now. There's no safe level of asbestos, and we know we're getting some.'' He added, ''From a medical point of view, this is so unacceptable.''</p>
        <p>When the state first proposed its air monitoring plan in April, it said it would analyze only fibers that were longer than five microns and slimmer than half a micron. A micron is a thousandth of a millimeter, or .000039 inches. That definition of a fiber is more limited than the one used by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration to protect miners and quarry workers.</p>
        <p>In recent interviews, three prominent doctors who have treated asbestos workers for lung cancer said tremolite fibers up to three microns wide can be inhaled and possibly cause lung cancer. The three, Bruce W. Case, Jerrod Abraham and Stephen Levin, all run departments of environmental or occupational medicine at major teaching hospitals.</p>
        <p>The state's initial standard was proposed by an E.P.A. consultant, Wayne Berman, who is also a consultant for a developer building homes on a formation containing tremolite in El Dorado County, Calif., east of Sacramento. But E.P.A. officials say the agency will not use Dr. Berman's standard for federal tremolite investigations until independent scientific experts review it.</p>
        <p>New Jersey, nonetheless, will use it immediately, without outside peer review, said Alan Stern, who is directing the study for the State Department of Environmental Protection. In addition, the state revealed today, it will  calculate health risks based on the fiber standard the federal government has used for years. That standard considers fibers longer than five microns and wider than a quarter of a micron a risk.</p>
        <p>The critics of the state's initial plan had argued that testing must include fibers that size to obtain a true assessment of risk. Nonetheless, Dr. Stern says he is not so certain. ''We think the most recent and better scientific evidence suggests wider fibers are not as predictive of risk,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cifelli, one of the quarry's foes, said today that she was pleased with the state's announcement about the start of testing. ''This should have been done a long time ago,'' she said. ''Every day that's wasted starting the study is another day of risk for the community.''</p>
