        <p>However much the selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman has helped the presidential prospects of Vice President Al Gore, it has dimmed the Democrats' flickering hopes of regaining the Senate.</p>
        <p>Those hopes shot up when Georgia's former Democratic governor Zell Miller was named to replace Senator Paul Coverdell, a Republican, who died last month. Mr. Miller is generally conceded to be a sure winner in November. That meant the Senate had 54 Republicans and 46 Democrats, and so the minority had to gain five seats for a clear majority, or just four if Mr. Gore won and his vice president could cast a tie-breaking vote.</p>

        <p>However much the selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman has helped the presidential prospects of Vice President Al Gore, it has dimmed the Democrats' flickering hopes of regaining the Senate.</p>
        <p>Those hopes shot up when Georgia's former Democratic governor Zell Miller was named to replace Senator Paul Coverdell, a Republican, who died last month. Mr. Miller is generally conceded to be a sure winner in November. That meant the Senate had 54 Republicans and 46 Democrats, and so the minority had to gain five seats for a clear majority, or just four if Mr. Gore won and his vice president could cast a tie-breaking vote.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Lieberman is elected vice president, his replacement under Connecticut law would be an appointee of Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican who would not pick a Democrat. And the Democrats would need, elsewhere, to win five more seats than they lost, giving them 50. Mr. Lieberman could break a tie, so they would control the Senate.</p>
        <p>If the Gore-Lieberman ticket loses but Mr. Lieberman, as expected, wins re-election to the Senate, the Democrats would still need to win, elsewhere, five more seats than they lost, for a total of 51. If they had only 50, Dick Cheney, as vice president, would break a tie against them.</p>
        <p>So the Democratic goal is back to a net gain of five seats. Even the minority leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, calls that goal, with characteristic understatement, ''tough.''</p>
        <p>For a gain of that size, Democrats would need to get a victory by their only embattled incumbent, Charles S. Robb of Virginia; take four out of five open seats (in Florida, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey and New York) and then defeat five out of the nine more or less vulnerable Republicans, in Delaware, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle called those gains ''doable.'' Dave Hansen, political director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said they were far-fetched. But Mr. Hansen said the choice of Mr. Lieberman had ''negated Georgia.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut Republicans have taunted Mr. Lieberman to withdraw to show his confidence in a Gore victory. But he is not taking the bait.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, interviewed on Tuesday on CNN's ''Larry King Live,'' said: ''I have the intention of continuing to be a candidate for re-election to the Senate. The people in Connecticut have asked me to do that. The law allows it. It is a very complicated process in Connecticut. If I withdrew from the election, a very small group of people would choose the nominee. And I don't know if that is fair to the people of the state.''</p>
        <p>He also said there ''could be a special election next year,'' so the loss of a seat would be only temporary. But, in fact, Connecticut law would have Mr. Rowland's appointee serve until the election of 2002.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle had been given the same misinformation about Connecticut law. He got it from Mr. Gore himself. Mr. Daschle had spoken publicly about his hope that Mr. Gore would not choose a senator from a state with a Republican governor. But on Monday afternoon, Mr. Daschle said in an interview that Mr. Gore had told him that very day that Connecticut law called for a special election early next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle offered a different view on Thursday. What he now knew about the law, he said, ''makes our situation a little more complicated.''</p>
        <p>''Connecticut is a very Democratic state,'' he said, ''and I'm sure when the election is held, we'll retain it.''</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign did not respond when asked how Mr. Gore happened to misinform Mr. Daschle.</p>
        <p>Jim Jordan, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said that if the Gore-Lieberman ticket looked like a winner in late October, Mr. Lieberman would quit the Senate race then.  Mr. Jordan said that the state's Democratic attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, could win the seat even with only 10 days to campaign.</p>
