        <p>Twelve people were trapped for an hour inside an elevator between the 78th and 79th floors of the World Trade Center yesterday morning, after the elevator overshot a floor, hit a concrete ceiling and then plummeted 15 feet, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>All of those in the car when it malfunctioned at 8 a.m. were either on their way to their offices or making deliveries. They suffered relatively minor injuries, including fractured ankles and cuts from debris that fell before they were evacuated, the authorities said. To rescue them, firefighters rode up in a second elevator, climbed on top of the broken car and unfastened the siding. Passengers who could walk were helped onto the roof of the working elevator and down inside. Others were carried out on backboards. The last passenger was rescued around 10 a.m.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it was still not clear last night what had caused the elevator to overshoot the 78th floor by about a floor and a half. The Port Authority operates the seven buildings of the World Trade Center, whose twin towers are an icon of New York City, its tallest skyscrapers and -- at 1,368 and 1,362 feet -- the world's fifth and sixth tallest buildings, by most accounts.  The incident prompted ripples of concern among workers and tourists in the downtown hub. The center's observation deck, on the 107th floor of the tower in question, 2 World Trade Center, is a classic stop for visitors to the city.</p>
        <p>No tourists were on the elevator. A separate elevator travels directly to the 107th floor of the slightly shorter tower; the observation deck does not open until 9:30 a.m. The World Trade Center's 246 elevators carry about 12.5 million passengers a year, generally without incident, said Peter Yerkes, the authority's spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yerkes estimated that 2 World Trade Center's faulty elevator, No. 20, made 720 trips a day to the 78th floor, where passengers switch to elevators that stop on upper floors.</p>
        <p>''Any time you have a complex this huge, with elevators that travel more than a million miles a year, you will have occasional instances of stuck doors or bouncing,'' Mr. Yerkes said. ''But that's a vastly different order of magnitude than what happened today. I'm not aware of any incidents such as this since the first tenants moved in 30 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yerkes said that in accordance with regulations, each elevator in the World Trade Center was inspected every eight months and thoroughly examined every five years. He said he was certain that the faulty elevator was inspected within the last eight months, although the Port Authority was still searching for records indicating exactly when that inspection took place. The elevator had its last five-year inspection in 1997, Mr. Yerkes said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, workers pouring out of the World Trade Center building with the faulty elevator expressed concern about the morning's events. Elena Guevara, 32, said a prayer before descending from her office on the 94th floor. ''I just said 'Please, let me go down safely,' '' said Ms. Guevara, who works at Fiduciary Trust Company International, an investment firm.</p>
        <p>Three Fiduciary Trust employees were among those trapped in the elevator, their colleagues said. One woman who works at the firm broke both of her ankles in the fall. Another passenger broke one ankle, a third broke a wrist and a fourth was cut in the head, apparently from falling debris, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Standing inside the World Trade Center lobby last night, Jessica Weiser, 23, was preparing to take a different sort of plunge. She was planning to wed her fiance in a ceremony on the observation deck.</p>
        <p>''I was a little nervous when I heard at work about the elevator,'' said Ms. Weiser, clutching a bouquet of pink roses. Now, she said: ''I'm really just excited to get up there and get married. I'm not really thinking about the elevator. I'll think about that on the way down.''</p>
