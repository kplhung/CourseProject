        <p>POLAND: WALESA CLEARED -- Lech Walesa, who fought Communist rule for two decades before its fall in 1989, was cleared of collaborating with the Communist-era secret police and will be allowed to run for the presidency, which he lost in 1995. He was forced to defend his reputation in a special screening court, which dismissed suggestions in old police files that he spied on fellow dissidents. Mr. Walesa, the founder of Solidarity, was scrutinized under a 1998 law that requires candidates to declare whether they cooperated with the Communist secret services. There is no penalty for admitting collaboration, but anyone found to have lied is banned from public office for 10 years.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: ANTI-RIGHTIST TASK FORCE -- A working group representing the German government and the 16 states gathered for a first meeting to discuss banning the far-right National Democratic Party. The group, which is expected to present its conclusions by mid-October, will consider the judicial aspects of a ban and collect evidence of anti-constitutional activities by the party. It will also consider bans of Germany's other right-wing parties.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: ISLAMICIST SOUGHT -- An arrest warrant was issued for Fetullah Gulen, the leader of an Islamic group that is seen by military leaders as a threat to Turkey's secular government and by his admirers as a nation-building tool. The charges have not yet been specified, but a prosecutor has accused Mr. Gulen of plotting to establish an Islamic government, which could carry the death penalty. Mr. Gulen, 61, is in the United States for medical treatment, but his associates say he would be willing to return to Turkey to face formal charges.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: WHALE HUNT GOES FORWARD -- Ignoring international criticism, Japan said its whaling ships have so far caught and killed one sperm and four Bryde's whales, which many countries consider endangered species. Japan plans to catch 50 Bryde's, 10 sperm and 160 minke whales this season. The United States has threatened to impose sanctions against Japan, which insists its whale hunts are for scientific research although the whale meat is sold in restaurants.</p>

        <p>CHINA: APPEAL FOR LAWYER -- More than 30,000 villagers have petitioned their provincial government to free a lawyer jailed for helping them fight high taxes and brutal officials, the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said. The residents of eight poor villages demanded that the Shaanxi Province high court overturn a five-year jail sentence handed down to Ma Wenlin last year after he went to Beijing to file an appeal with the central government.</p>
        <p>Craig Smith (NYT)</p>
        <p>CHINA: WARNING TO JAPAN -- China warned Japan that a decision by top officials to visit a shrine honoring Japan's war dead, including several war criminals, demonstrates a callous disregard for the victims of Japanese militarism. Japanese cabinet members have said they will visit Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine on the anniversary of the end of World War II.</p>
        <p>Craig Smith (NYT)</p>
        <p>JAPAN: HELP FOR AMERASIAN SCHOOL -- The government said it will provide about $2 million to a school for Amerasian children on the island of Okinawa, where vast United States military bases are located. The cash-strapped school, started five years ago by parents, provides a nurturing environment for pupils who are typically the children of Japanese women and American servicemen and often suffer discrimination in Japanese public schools.</p>

        <p>CONGO: REBEL ATTACK -- A rebel leader in northwest Congo said his forces sank two government gunboats on the Ubangi River, killing 800 soldiers. The government of President Laurent Kabila denied the assertion by the rebel leader, Jean-Pierre Bemba. But the government also said it would halt an offensive against Mr. Bemba that began last month. If Mr. Bemba's claims are true, it would mark one of the largest losses of life in the two-year civil war. A cease-fire was signed last year among all warring factions, though battles have continued.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: RESTRAINTS ON MISSING EX-MINISTER -- A district judge ordered the former minister of tourism to remain in the country as prosecutors investigate him for charges of embezzling $45 million in government funds. The order came three days after prosecutors were unable to locate Oscar Espinosa Villareal, who is widely believed to have fled. Mr. Espinosa resigned from the Tourism Ministry this week after prosecutors said they could not press charges against a member of the Cabinet.</p>
        <p>Ginger Thompson (NYT)</p>
        <p>ARGENTINA: BABY-THEFT ARREST -- Santiago Omar Riveros, a retired general, was arrested to testify on suspicions that he was involved in a conspiracy to seize the babies of dissidents who gave birth while they were held prisoner during the 1976-83 military dictatorship and give the children to the families of military personnel. He was the 10th senior officer arrested in the last two years in connection with the plan. General Riveros denied he was involved.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAQ: LINK TO SYRIA -- Iraq resumed a railroad service to Syria, 19 years after rail connections between the two countries were cut, the official Iraqi News Agency said. Relations between Iraq and Syria have improved in recent months after two decades of tension. Syria backed Iran in the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war and was a member of a military coalition that drove Iraqi forces from Kuwait in the 1991 gulf war.</p>
