        <p>Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman came to this small factory town outside Philadelphia today to praise working women. They visited Little Souls, a company owned by women that makes handcrafted dolls, where they called for equal pay and expanded day care benefits. Both paid elaborate homage to their own wives, daughters and mothers.</p>
        <p>''When my sister and I were growing up,'' Mr. Gore told a small audience made up mostly of women, ''there was never any doubt in our minds that men and women were equal, if not more so.''</p>
        <p>Unmentioned, though, was the one topic that had their audience buzzing this morning: aggressive efforts by Mr. Gore and the Democratic National Committee to scuttle a Democratic congresswoman's fund-raiser next Tuesday at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. Several women here described the site as the sleazy epitome of a society that treats women not as equals but as sex symbols to be exploited and degraded.</p>
        <p>That kind of sentiment, expressed repeatedly elsewhere in recent days, had its effect: tonight the congresswoman, Representative Loretta Sanchez of California, announced that she was moving the fund-raiser to Universal Studios.</p>
        <p>But on a day when the Gore campaign had hoped to highlight proposals for helping working women, it instead found itself facing questions about values, its tolerance for sexually explicit publications and campaign contributions from Playboy executives.</p>
        <p>''They sure do enjoy that Playboy money,'' said Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, all too happy to portray Mr. Gore and his campaign aides as morally selective for accepting those contributions  even as they criticized Ms. Sanchez.</p>
        <p>Today, before word of the congresswoman's reversal began to circulate, Mr. Gore said in a Fox television interview that he supported the action of the party chairman, Joe Andrew, in taking away her speaking role at the Democratic National Convention because of her earlier refusal to move her event. And during the appearance here at Little Souls, Mr. Lieberman pointedly emphasized that a Gore-Lieberman White House would work to help families teach strong moral values to their children.</p>
        <p>But the Gore campaign's efforts to quickly put the Playboy matter to rest were complicated by its refusal thus far to return a $1,000 campaign contribution from Hugh Hefner, Playboy's founder, and a $500 contribution from his daughter, Christie Hefner, the chief executive of Playboy Enterprises.</p>
        <p>''Apples and oranges,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's campaign press secretary, when asked the difference between holding a fund-raiser at the mansion and accepting campaign contributions from Playboy executives. The Hefners' contributions, he said, are only a tiny fraction of the money raised by the Gore campaign, while the fund-raiser is a major event for some 600 guests.</p>
        <p>Richard Rosenzweig, executive vice president of Playboy Enterprises, defended the company in an interview, saying it was as ''American as apple pie'' and asserting that Mr. Gore and other party leaders were ''following political correctness right out the window.''</p>
        <p>''I am very disappointed in the party,'' he added. ''I would never have expected this from a party that we have supported financially and editorially through the pages of the magazine for many years.''</p>
        <p>According to campaign records, Playboy executives have made several contributions to Democratic candidates. Mr. Rosenzweig contributed $500 to the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996, and another $500 to Geraldine A. Ferraro's 1998 Senate campaign in New York. Helen Isaacson, a senior vice president for Playboy, donated $500 to Bill Bradley's presidential campaign this year. In 1996, Ms. Hefner donated $250 to John D. Dingell, a veteran Democratic congressman from Michigan.</p>
        <p>Later today the vice president  traveled to Detroit to formally accept the endorsement of the United Automobile Workers, and then to New York City for a dinner raising $600,000 for the Democratic Party.</p>
