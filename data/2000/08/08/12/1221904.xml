        <p>Japan's Ministry of Finance selected four investment banks to manage a sale of shares in the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, one of the most coveted deals in the securities industry. The winners were Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs in Tokyo, Nikko Salomon Smith Barney and Nomura Securities, each of which will earn tens of millions of dollars in fees when the government, which currently owns 53 percent of the former telephone monopoly, sells as many as one million shares valued around $12 billion sometime in the fall. The brokerage houses were chosen from a final list of 10 firms.</p>
