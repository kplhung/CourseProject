        <p>Mark Gardner threw a fastball that tailed inside on Mike Piazza, and immediately Gardner knew. Everyone knew. Gardner slammed his hand against his right leg, glanced toward left field and then looked away.

        <p>Mark Gardner threw a fastball that tailed inside on Mike Piazza, and immediately Gardner knew. Everyone knew. Gardner slammed his hand against his right leg, glanced toward left field and then looked away. But Piazza's towering shot in the fourth inning stayed in the air so long that Gardner peeked one more time, watched the two-run homer land in the picnic area and shook his head.</p>
        <p>By that time, Piazza was nearing second base and Snap's ''I Got the Power'' was blaring on a soggy night at Shea Stadium. The Mets definitely had the power last night as Edgardo Alfonzo pounded a two-run homer two innings later to almost the identical spot as Piazza's blow and helped the Mets rumble to a 4-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants.</p>
        <p>So the Mets kept on churning. They have won 14 of their last 17 games, they still trail the first-place Atlanta Braves by two and a half games but they have padded their lead in the wild-card skirmish. On a night when Glendon Rusch was more gritty than good, the Mets were satisfied with his five tedious innings as he allowed only one run.</p>
        <p>Three relievers nabbed the last 12 outs and helped the Mets begin avenging a four-game sweep by San Francisco in early May. The Mets are a different team now, an improved team, and they have not lost more than three games in a row since that series.</p>
        <p>Their starters have been superb, their bullpen has been awesome and Piazza is playing like a most valuable player, which the fans chanted over and over.</p>
        <p>''Mike's been most valuable, most spectacular and most dependable,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''He's been the most of a lot of things this year.''</p>
        <p>Valentine said that Piazza seems ''more driven'' this season, more driven to carry the Mets to a World Series title because it is ''that time in his career.'' Piazza lowered his head when he was asked about the fans chanting ''M.V.P., M.V.P.'' for his 31 homers, 97 runs batted in and .349 average.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of early,'' said Piazza, who has twice finished second in voting for the award. ''Obviously, it's flattering. You've got to try and contribute and do your job when you get up there.''</p>
        <p>Dusty Baker and Valentine shook hands behind the batting cage before the game, which was just as curious as Valentine and the Mets' president, Fred Wilpon, doing it. Baker and Valentine are managers who do not like each other, and Wilpon has adamantly refused to give Valentine or General Manager Steve Phillips contract extensions.</p>
        <p>But Baker had to watch Piazza and Alfonzo go deep, which made Valentine smile, and Wilpon must wonder about his decisions and what kind of an impact they might have on the Mets in 2001.</p>
        <p>For now, the Mets are focused on today. Gardner faced only nine batters through the first three innings and was incredibly economical, throwing only three pitches for balls. But Darryl Hamilton, who was starting a game in left field for the first time since Sept. 20, 1993, had a leadoff double in the fourth.</p>
        <p>After Gardner retired the next two Mets, Piazza strolled to the plate and there was a buzz. Piazza had two homers in 15 career at-bats against Gardner, and, when Gardner threw a 1-0 fastball that rode in on the hands, Piazza quickly turned on it and hammered it. Piazza is 8 for 20 with two homers and 12 runs batted in over the last five games since returning from a strained knee.</p>
        <p>''As far as my vote goes, he'd be my M.V.P.,'' Rusch said about an award that is voted on by sportswriters. ''He's doing it all. He's a huge presence in the lineup.''</p>
        <p>Alfonzo, who heard the same chants last season that Piazza is hearing in 2000, said, ''He's the guy right now.''</p>
        <p>Before Piazza's 411-foot homer, the Giants had loaded the bases against Rusch in the second and third innings without scoring. Rusch took advantage of Umpire Charlie Williams's wide strike zone to strike out Barry Bonds and Rich Aurilia with 1-2 fastballs on the inside corner in the third. Both players complained, but Rusch survived.</p>
        <p>The Giants nicked Rusch for a run in the fifth, but Rusch retired Aurilia with his 103rd pitch of the game and his night was over. Then Alfonzo hit a two-run homer, Gardner hopped off the mound in distress a second time and the Mets were happy to be home. They were also thrilled that the valuable Piazza is wearing their uniform.</p>
        <p>''I'm not trying to set any benchmarks or records,'' Piazza said. ''I've always let the attention take care of itself. I'm honored. I'm not doing more than trying to be consistent. It's kind of boring, but it works for me.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>BOBBY VALENTINE continued to play musical outfielders as he tries to fit four outfielders into three positions. DARRYL HAMILTON made his first start in left in almost seven years, JAY PAYTON was in center, DEREK BELL handled right and BENNY AGBAYANI was benched. In the three games since Hamilton was activated, the only constant has been Payton in center. Valentine said the outfield was only a story because of the news media scrutiny in New York. ''Being in our city, the guys have to understand that it's not a big deal if they miss a game,'' Valentine said. Hamilton has advised his teammates to focus on the ''big picture'' and not who starts. ''If I can deal with this, I think a couple of young guys can deal with it, too,'' said Hamilton.</p>
