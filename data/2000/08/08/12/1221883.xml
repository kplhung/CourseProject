        <p>The shouts come as furiously as the plays for Shaun Ellis. The rookie defensive end, the Jets' first pick in their extraordinary draft class, barely has time to recover from another defensive drill in another exhausting practice before he is expected to work on special teams.</p>
        <p>Time to practice punts? Ellis is there. The kickoff return team? Ellis is a backup. The live goal-line scrimmage that punctuates every practice? That is Ellis lined up on the left side.</p>
        <p>All the while, accompanying Ellis like an out-of-tune diva, is the defensive line coach Ray Hamilton. Ellis has been the favorite target of the earsplitting Hamilton in training camp. If Hamilton doesn't think Ellis has finished off his rush, he tells him in words loud enough and harsh enough to singe the grass at the Jets' training camp at Hofstra University.</p>
        <p>It is tough love, explains Hamilton, who used the same method when he helped develop another first-round pick, the former Jet Hugh Douglas, into an effective pass rusher. When a football coach ignores a player, it usually means the player is on the way out. And Ellis is most definitely on his way in.</p>
        <p>''When guys are in training camp, they forget what got them there,'' Hamilton said. ''When they're thinking about so many things, they forget what they did in college.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton is going to remind Ellis at every turn that, in the end, he needs to be mean. Ellis will get his second chance as a starter at left end tonight, when the Jets face the Ravens in Baltimore. But all the martial-arts techniques Hamilton imparts to help linesmen get an offensive lineman's hands off them will be for naught if Ellis is so busy that he forgets the most fundamental part of his job.</p>
        <p>Ellis's head may be swimming with the details of all his assignments and with the difficult transition from playing a 4-3 defense in college to the 3-4 formation the Jets employ. But he and linebacker John Abraham, another first-round selection, are the great Jet hopes for improving what had been a dormant pass rush.</p>
        <p>Against the Ravens tonight in the Jets' third preseason game, the pass rush will get an enormous test, quite literally. The Ravens have two huge offensive tackles: the 14-year veteran, Harry Swayne (6 feet 5 inches, 300 pounds) and the three-time Pro Bowl starter, Jonathan Ogden (6-8, 340 pounds).</p>
        <p>''You have to be mean, nasty and violent to be a defensive lineman,'' said Hamilton, who played on the New England defense in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh has stressed the importance of developing versatility among linemen so that each player can perform at more than one position. But Ellis has practiced only on the left, in an attempt to speed his progress by getting him hundreds of repetitions on plays that he may not have seen in college.</p>
        <p>''We're pushing him into everything,'' Groh said. ''There will be a time to trim back and say, 'This is where we need to use him in the first game.' But we're pushing him in rather than easing him in. I don't think he's going to be ready for the N.F.L. on Sept. 3 by easing him in.''</p>
        <p>Ellis is soft-spoken, but even while hampered by an elbow injury, he has turned on the merciless attitude that Hamilton seeks. He and Abraham had consecutive sacks against the New Orleans Saints in the Jets' opening preseason game. And even though the defense played poorly as a whole against the Green Bay Packers the next week, Hamilton spotted one play by Ellis that was a glimpse of the speed and power the Jets hope he will demonstrate on a consistent basis. ''They ran a draw play; he was way upfield and Ellis retraced his steps and made the tackle,'' Hamilton said. ''That was an amazingly athletic play. And he had just used the wrong technique on the play before.''</p>
        <p>Ellis takes Hamilton's praise with as much restraint as he takes the coach's heat. ''It comes with the opportunity,'' Ellis said. ''I'm just trying to soak everything in. I put pressure on myself to do well in everything I do. When I don't, I've got to take a deep look at myself.''</p>
        <p>If Hamilton doesn't do so first.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Offensive lineman JUMBO ELLIOTT, who briefly retired this spring, will rejoin the Jets on Monday. The 35-year-old Elliott met with Coach AL GROH and BILL PARCELLS, the director of football operations, earlier this week. Elliott and the Jets will discuss a new contract, but he will report under the terms of his existing deal, which will pay him $500,000. Elliott, who is returning as a backup, will appeal the two-game suspension the league issued for his role in a bar brawl last year.</p>
