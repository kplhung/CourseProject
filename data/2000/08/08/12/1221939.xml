        <p>DEITCH-Stanley. To Gail, Steven and Laura, we share the sorrow of your loss. Stanley was a loving and wonderful man who Steven first met 37 years ago. As families, we have shared so much. Stanley was always there for all of us. Always loving caring and humorous. As difficult as it is, now you must look forward. That is what Stanley wants for you. All our love, Lesley, Steven and Geoff</p>
