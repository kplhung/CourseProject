        <p>Less than three weeks after the Camp David push for a final Middle East peace settlement ended without agreement, perhaps the most promising development, by the reckoning of many on both sides, is what has not happened.</p>
        <p>Despite dire warnings of bloodshed if the talks collapsed, there has been almost no violence. Apart from minor clashes, Israelis and Palestinians have gone peacefully about their lives.</p>
        <p>Coordination between Israeli Army and police commanders and the security chiefs for Yasir Arafat's Palestinian Authority, unthinkable only a few years ago, has helped to keep things tranquil. In fact, the Palestinian security forces have won high praise from Israeli military commanders.</p>
        <p>Then there were the warnings that the Arab world would unite to stiffen Mr. Arafat's resolve not to budge on his claim to Jerusalem. Instead, a whirlwind tour of his backers among Arabs and Europeans has left Mr. Arafat with almost unanimous advice to keep talking.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Arafat set out on his tour, the assumption was that he was hoping for a common front in backing his refusal to compromise at Camp David. But as his itinerary has lengthened, some diplomats have come to suspect that the Palestinian leader is taking soundings on whether the Palestinians' traditional backers, especially Arab nations, might accept a compromise over Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>''If he's going to back off, and I don't say that he will, he's going to need cover,'' a Western diplomat said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat traveled today to Moscow, one of more than a dozen capitals on his itinerary, and there he also encountered a reluctance to see the peace effort founder over Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>According to news agency reports from Moscow, the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, urged further negotiations with Israel, and advised Mr. Arafat not to make ''unilateral decisions,'' the code for Mr. Arafat's threat to declare a Palestinian state on Sept. 13 on his own.</p>
        <p>''We think it extremely important to continue the negotiations, and to reach a peace agreement,'' Igor S. Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, told reporters.</p>
        <p>As important were upbeat comments from Mr. Arafat, 71.</p>
        <p>''We must complete this peace process, no matter what difficulties we encounter on our way, for the sake of our children, the children of our children, for our future,'' he said today.</p>
        <p>In Egypt, where Mr. Arafat met with President Hosni Mubarak on Wednesday, there were also signs of flexibility. Mr. Mubarak's chief political adviser, Osama el-Baz, suggested a readiness for compromise when he said on Thursday that Egypt would not dictate to the Palestinians on Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>''Our role is not to deliver the Palestinians, and not to exert pressure on them,'' Mr. Baz said. ''On the other hand, our role is not to tell them to harden and not accept what is offered. Our role is to encourage.''</p>
        <p>From Moscow, Mr. Arafat flew to Finland, and then to Norway, where he was scheduled to meet with Shimon Peres of Israel. But reports from Oslo said Mr. Arafat had arrived later than expected, forcing the cancellation of their meeting.</p>
        <p>The two men shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated Israeli prime minister, for their roles in reaching the 1993 Oslo agreement, which started the Israelis and Palestinians on a path toward peace. Although Mr. Peres, 77, now holds a relatively junior cabinet post, minister for regional cooperation, and was unexpectedly defeated in a contest for the Israeli presidency last week, he had arrived in Oslo saying he hoped to discuss possible future courses for a Middle East peace.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials continued to sound optimistic. Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel's new foreign minister, said in Barcelona that negotiations with the Palestinians were continuing with the purpose of closing ''everything that needs to be closed'' and setting up a ''short and decisive summit.''</p>
        <p>The chief American mediator in the Middle East, Dennis Ross, was due in the region next week for a round of meetings.</p>
        <p>To be sure, there were also voices of discord. In talks with Iran's leaders in Tehran on Thursday, Mr. Arafat was told to hold firm on Jerusalem. The visit assumed special significance because Iran is the current chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, made up of about 50 Muslim states.</p>
        <p>''No Muslim can allow holy Jerusalem to remain under occupation, and the Organization of the Islamic Conference will never let any deal be made over Jerusalem,'' the Iranian foreign minister, Kamal Karrazi, told Mr. Arafat, according to news agency reports.</p>
        <p>Reports from Saudi Arabia suggested that the Saudis, who claim a special authority on matters like Jerusalem because of their guardianship of the two holiest sites in Islam, Mecca and Medina, have also opposed any compromise on Jerusalem. But several Arab states in the Persian Gulf, under pressure from the United States, have shied away from any all-or-nothing statements on Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Some diplomats believe that Mr. Arafat may find it hard to resist new negotiations even in the absence of an Israeli compromise on East Jerusalem. In this view, Mr. Arafat may find it difficult to slam the door conclusively on proposals put forward by President Clinton. In addition to Jerusalem, these proposals would give the Palestinians sovereignty over much of the West Bank, would entail Israeli acceptance of Palestinian statehood, and would set up a Western aid fund that could run into billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Even the proposals for Jerusalem could be hard to reject if Mr. Arafat concluded that a majority of Palestinians and their backers, like Russia and Egypt, would support, or at least not oppose, their acceptance.</p>
