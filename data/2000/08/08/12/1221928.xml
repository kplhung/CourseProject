        <p>It was 1998 and the worst start of Orlando Hernandez's career. It also could have been the best thing that happened to him. Their lineup stocked with left-handed hitters, the Anaheim Angels peppered El Duque for 13 hits and 10 runs in three and one-third innings here two years ago, incontrovertible evidence that Hernandez had to change his approach and pitch inside more.</p>
        <p>El Duque is having more trouble with left-handed batters lately, a problem illuminated once more by the Angels, who thumped the Yankees by 8-3 tonight. Mo Vaughn and Garret Anderson each had two-run doubles for Anaheim, and the Yankees' lead over the Boston Red Sox in the American League East was trimmed to four games.</p>
        <p>This time, it seems Hernandez has been unable to pitch inside to left-handers, rather than unwilling. He threw 71 pitches to left-handers in the first five innings, and not once did any of the Anaheim lefties swing and miss. Hernandez (8-9) allowed nine hits and seven runs in six and one-third innings, and he has replaced David Cone as the Yankees' most notable pitching puzzle.</p>
        <p>Hernandez has always been more effective against right-handed batters than lefties because he can entice right-handers to flail at his slider. But his slider is not nearly as dangerous against left-handers, and Hernandez has had to find other ways to finish them off.</p>
        <p>After learning a lesson here two years ago, he starting jamming lefties with fastballs, mixing them up with changeups and slow curveballs. Lately, however, Hernandez has struggled to control his fastball and his changeup when throwing to lefties, and has been getting knocked around.</p>
        <p>When Seattle beat El Duque last weekend, left-handed batters reached base in 6 of 14 plate appearances; tonight, lefties reached base in 10 of their first 18 plate appearances, a .556 on-base percentage. The Angels scored four runs in the first inning against Hernandez, on a single by Darin Erstad, a walk issued to Orlando Palmeiro, Vaughn's two-run double, and run-scoring hits by Garret Anderson and Adam Kennedy -- all left-handed batters. Two right-handed batters hit in the inning; Tim Salmon and Troy Glaus struck out.</p>
        <p>When the half-inning finally ended, after 30 pitches, catcher Jorge Posada got a quick lecture from Manager Joe Torre and Hernandez rested on the bench, a white towel draped around his neck, looking like a boxer at the end of a brutal first round. Billy Connors, the Yankees' interim pitching coach, played the role of trainer, standing directly before Hernandez, placing his hands lightly on each of Hernandez's legs, speaking to his pitcher. Hernandez sometimes glanced at Connors, but mostly looked away, frustrated. He pitched inside more often to left-handed batter thereafter, with mixed results.</p>
        <p>The Yankees appeared on the verge of a comeback several times against Scott Schoeneweis, the Anaheim starter. But they stranded two runners in the second inning and scored one run and left another runner in scoring position in the third. Glenallen Hill rocketed a ball to right-center in the fourth, with a runner at first, and the ball disappeared into the stands. But Mike Reilly, the first-base umpire, immediately signaled fan interference, ruling that an Edison Field patron had reached out from the grandstand, over the playing field, and pulled Hill's drive into the stands; the replay showed his call was correct.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had runners on second and third with nobody out. First baseman Tino Martinez took a called third strike, turned and argued with the home plate umpire Laz Diaz, who had a number of exchanges with hitters from both teams. Scott Brosius took a called third strike, and he turned and gawked at Diaz incredulously. When Luis Sojo lined out to end a rally that resulted in no runs, Brosius flung a cup of water and took an angry swipe at a cooler.</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams bashed a two-run homer the next inning, cutting the Anaheim lead to 4-3. The Angels' left-handed batters responded in the bottom of the fifth: Erstad reached out and poked a looping double inside the left-field line, and Vaughn walked with one out. After a fielder's choice groundout, Hernandez got ahead on the count to Anderson, no balls and two strikes.</p>
        <p>Needing one pitch to stifle the Angels' rally, Hernandez tried nicking the outside corner with a breaking ball, but when it drifted over the plate, Anderson reached out to pull a line drive to right-center field. As Vaughn rounded third, he waved an arm, beckoning Salmon to follow, both scoring easily to give Anaheim a 6-3 lead.</p>
        <p>The Yankees threatened in the seventh. After Williams singled with two out, pushing Posada to second base, the right-hander Mike Fhyrie came in to pitch and worked carefully to the right-handed Jose Canseco, walking the slugger on four pitches. The bases were loaded, but Fhyrie got out of the inning when Hill flied to right.</p>
        <p>Erstad collected his third hit of the game, his 180th hit of the season, in leading off the seventh with a single. The left-hander Randy Choate relieved Hernandez with one out to pitch to Vaughn, and Erstad -- apparently attuned to a scouting report on the rookie -- stole second and third and scored on a sacrifice fly.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Yankees traded the infielder WILSON DELGADO, who had been designated for assignment, to the Kansas City Royals for NICK ORTIZ, a 27-year-old minor league shortstop.</p>
