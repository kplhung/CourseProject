        <p>As a Stanford assistant coach in 1982, Jim Fassel watched as California defeated Stanford on the game's final play with a crazed kickoff return through a host of defenders and the Cardinal marching band.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Fassel thought he was watching his Giants conclude an impressive preseason game at Jacksonville when another football game went bizarre on him.</p>
        <p>With seven seconds remaining in a game the Giants led by 4 points, Giants reserve cornerback Fred Lewis intercepted a pass from Jacksonville's third-string quarterback, Jonathan Quinn, near the Giants' goal line.</p>
        <p>Lewis, a rookie, ran a yard into the playing field with the interception and then ran sideways across the goal line. At that point, the backup linebacker Jack Golden, another rookie, thought he wanted to keep Lewis in the end zone for a touchback. So he tackled him.</p>
        <p>But Golden knocked the ball from Lewis's grasp and into the end zone, where Jacksonville's Brandon Christenson recovered it for a touchdown and a 16-13 Jaguars victory.</p>
        <p>All that was missing was the marching band.</p>
        <p>In the locker room afterward, Fassel loudly chided his players, reminding them that he had emphasized playing smart in an even louder harangue following Wednesday's practices.</p>
        <p>''Holy smokes,'' Fassel said when he emerged. ''It's really disappointing to lose a game like that.''</p>
        <p>Because the Giants -- for the most part -- had played well, the mood inside the locker room was neither jovial nor unsettled.</p>
        <p>''I was standing with Michael Strahan yelling, 'Somebody make a play so we can get out of here,' '' running back Tiki Barber said. ''And when Fred intercepted it, Michael said: 'There's your play.' Then came the fumble and the touchdown. Michael said: 'Talk about the joy of victory and agony of defeat.' ''</p>
        <p>Golden was disconsolate after the game, although he was enveloped in the locker room by several teammates, including many veterans.</p>
        <p>''I told Coach Fassel I messed up,'' Golden said later. ''To lose a game like that and have it all be on my shoulders is intense. It's really tough.''</p>
        <p>Golden said he was trying to keep Lewis in the end zone. Lewis said he never saw Golden and that the play happened so fast, he still was not sure what happened.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want to let the team down,'' Lewis said. ''I thought I was out of the end zone and had to run.''</p>
        <p>Several minutes after the game, Fassel was allowing himself to be more philosophical about the night's events. After all, the Giants, especially their starters, had performed with a certain of precision.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to come down here and play with an attitude on the road,'' Fassel said of Alltel Stadium, where the Giants (0-2 in the preseason) have never played well. ''We did that. Everybody was down after this game, but we've got to put it in perspective. We've got to look at it in the overall scope of things. I'm not going to let one play change everything. Some things I saw I liked quite a bit.''</p>
        <p>The freaky conclusion did spoil for the Giants what was an otherwise good game for their first-team offense and defense.</p>
        <p>For a second consecutive week, the Giants' starers, led by quarterback Kerry Collins and Barber, moved the ball. The first-team defense delivered another steady performance.</p>
        <p>For a second consecutive week, the first teams left the field with a lead that the reserves could not hold.</p>
        <p>Collins completed 10 of 19 passes for 110 yards and a touchdown. Barber had 83 rushing yards in the first half. Wide receiver Amani Toomer caught just two passes, but continued to establish himself as a big-play threat. And the rookie Ron Dayne, while again looking dependable in short-yardage situations, also seemed to get stronger as the game unfolded, finishing with 66 rough-and-tumble rushing yards on 17 carries.</p>
        <p>It was Collins, as he had in the Giants' opening preseason loss to Chicago, who made the dominant impression with his confidence and poise. Collins threw the ball accurately and frequently deep down the field, and his passing statistics did not reflect three dropped passes.</p>
        <p>On the Giants' first possession -- throwing off his back foot after double-pumping -- Collins lofted a perfect pass to Toomer, who made a spinning catch as he fell over the goal line for a 22-yard touchdown. It was the kind of bold strike rarely attempted by the Giants in previous seasons -- and even more rarely executed properly.</p>
        <p>It put the Giants ahead by 7-0, a lead they extended to 10-0 on Brad Daluiso's 27-yard field goal. That drive was set up by a 55-yard dash around right end by Barber.</p>
        <p>Barber, the Giants' most consistent offensive weapon last season, had a couple of dazzling runs in what has been a spectacular preseason. Lighter and quicker this year, Barber was stuffed at the line of scrimmage on his long run, but flashed outside and raced down the sideline, outrunning all but one defender.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Giants' remade starting offensive line displayed the same unity apparent in last week's  loss to Chicago. Collins was not sacked and was hit in the pocket after passing just once. The running backs had holes to work with and time to find them as the Jaguars' defensive line rarely penetrated into the Giants' backfield.</p>
        <p>Defensively, end Cedric Jones had a strong game, getting one sack and combining with Strahan for another. The rest of the defensive line, particularly tackle Christian Peter, also played well.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>PETE MONTY started the game at middle linebacker for MIKE BARROW, who is out with a mildly sprained knee, but Monty left after the first series with a broken right thumb and will miss two-to-three weeks. The Giants' backup quarterback, JASON GARRETT, had to leave in the fourth quarter after he was spiked in the leg and needed stitches to close a gash.</p>
