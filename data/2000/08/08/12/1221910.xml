        <p>The New York State Department of Health yesterday suspended the medical license of a well-known fertility specialist with a busy, celebrity-favored practice who is facing retrial on insurance fraud charges.</p>
        <p>The state health commissioner, Dr. Antonia C. Novello, deciding the doctor posed ''an imminent danger to public health,'' used her emergency powers to suspend the license of Dr. Niels H. Lauersen before a state investigative committee had finished reviewing the cases brought against him.</p>
        <p>Health Department officials said they took the action against Dr. Lauersen, who was already on probation with the state for previous infractions, because of the nature of the charges against him and because he appeared confused and incoherent during several days of hearings.</p>
        <p>The report of the department's investigation details numerous charges of negligence, incompetence, fraudulent practices and moral unfitness involving seven patients. One charge involved a delivery that left a baby severely brain-damaged; another told of a patient on whom an unnecessary hysterectomy had been performed. The report further accuses the doctor of submitting fraudulent statements to insurance companies and hospitals to cover infertility treatments, and of pressing patients to evade state investigators.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lauersen is among the busiest gynecologists in the state, despite a spate of malpractice lawsuits and government investigations, at a time when more and more couples are confronting fertility problems.  He attracted a nearly cultlike following as he moved from hospital to hospital. While most specialists tend to be discreet about their celebrity patients, he brags about his, who include Celine Dion, Liv Ullmann and Geraldo Rivera's former wife, Kiki.</p>
        <p>The severity of the state action reflects Dr. Novello's decision to increasingly employ what had been a fairly rare action: forbidding doctors to practice medicine while an investigation is under way. She has suspended the licenses of 31 doctors so far this year, 19 more than in all of 1997.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Dr. Lauersen's lawyer, Robert S. Deutsch, denounced the department for taking such an extreme measure. ''The denial of a fair hearing, I believe, is merely a continuation of the department's vendetta against my doctor since 1995,'' he said, alluding to the year in which the state began investigating Dr. Lauersen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deutsch attributed Dr. Lauersen's apparent incoherence to fatigue brought on by the department's requirement that most of his hearings take place over 10 consecutive days, each lasting 12 hours. ''This has never before been done in the history of the department,'' Mr. Deutsch said.</p>
        <p>''We don't intend to let this drop here,'' he said. ''We are trying to stay the enforcement of this order.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lauersen's receptionist said yesterday that the doctor would not comment.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview, Dr. Lauersen dismissed the state's previous investigation as minor, and said he did not know what the state agency ''really is.'' He also denied that he was currently under investigation. ''The important thing is that I am careful in everything I do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lauersen is well known in the city's circle of obstetricians and gynecologists. In part, this is because of his unusual practice, which involves a great deal of fertility work (fertility specialists tend to help women to become pregnant and then pass their cases to obstetricians), and some of his more unorthodox practices, like staving off labor after a woman's water has already broken, several former colleagues said in interviews.</p>
        <p>''I would say he pushes the envelope on standards of practice,'' a former colleague said. ''But his patients adored him. He has a huge following.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lauersen's practice inspires nearly fanatic loyalty. He is the author of several books on fertility and gynecological health. He attracted national attention in the spring, when he was prosecuted by the federal government for what it charged was a fraud scheme in which he billed insurance companies for gynecological cases that actually involved fertility procedures. (The case ended with a hung jury and will be retried this fall.) He also has numerous medical malpractice judgments against him.</p>
        <p>During the trial in March, many of his patients sat on the left side of the courtroom, often with small children in tow. A clerk at times chastised this loyal group, who turned the courtroom hallways into a day-care center, with screaming children and wayward toys.</p>
        <p>His popularity with patients aside, Dr. Lauersen's troubles with patient care far predate those with the federal government. The state's earlier investigation into claims of negligence, like bungled infant deliveries, resulted in a two-year probation, with some charges dropped or substantially reduced. The state ruled that his practice should be monitored by his hospital employers and that he had to take a course in medical record keeping.</p>
        <p>When he was appointed to the staff of St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan last year, the state had already imposed sanctions on him, and he was forced to resign from Lenox Hill Hospital after a delivery that appears to be alluded to in the state report released yesterday. (The state never reveals the names of patients in its reports on doctors.)</p>
        <p>He is also accused of numerous clinical errors and negligent practices. The case detailed in the state report involved the delivery of a baby in 1998 at Lenox Hill, a case whose facts strongly resemble those in a lawsuit against the doctor. According to the report, the doctor induced labor, tried twice to deliver the baby with forceps, and instead was forced to do an emergency Caesarean section. The baby needed to be resuscitated and suffered brain damage.</p>
        <p>In other cases, the state accuses the doctor of performing various gynecological surgeries that were not medically needed; of carelessness during a delivery that resulted in a baby's defective shoulder; of incorrect recording of procedures; and of improper diagnoses. The report also states that the doctor called a patient on several occasions to discourage her husband from cooperating with the state's investigation, and that he submitted false information to insurance companies and St. Vincents about his employment history and government investigations.</p>
        <p>''Based on the evidence presented in this proceeding, it is the opinion of the hearing committee that respondent's continued practice of medicine represents an imminent danger to the health of the public,'' the report states. It says that Dr. Lauersen's case is ''fraught with dangerous, inappropriate techniques repeatedly used in the hospital and at his office.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lauersen's lawyer said the doctor ''denies and will defend all the charges against him.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lauersen first worked at New York Hospital, which he left in 1979. From there he went to Mount Sinai and then to Lenox Hill. He left Mount Sinai in 1984; the hospital would not provide details as to why. An executive there said only that he was dismissed, which the doctor denies.</p>
        <p>St. Vincents, whose infertility program is overshadowed by those of other centers, offered the doctor work last year and gave him admitting privileges.</p>
        <p>''There is a fine balance when someone comes to you for privileges, of denying or not denying,'' said Mark G. Ackermann, a senior vice president of the center, in a recent interview. He added that Dr. Lauersen was an ''innovator in the field of fertility,'' and that the doctor was ''under the appropriate circumstances, a good addition to the staff.''</p>
        <p>A hospital spokeswoman refused to comment yesterday on the state's latest findings.</p>
