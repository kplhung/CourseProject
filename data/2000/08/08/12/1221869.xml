        <p>Editorial holds that control board that Gov Christine Todd Whitman proposed for dysfunctional city of Camden may be tough by New Jersey's standards but no tougher than boards that revived prospects of other municipalities</p>

        <p>When bankrupt cities are taken over, it is usually by state-appointed control boards that dictate fiscal policy until the cities return to solvency. The board that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey has proposed for the dysfunctional city of Camden may be tough by New Jersey's standards but no tougher than the control boards that revived the prospects of municipalities like New York City, Chelsea, Mass., and, most recently, Washington. Camden's difficulty in governing itself was underscored recently when the City Council asked the state to assist in running the city attorney's office, which has been incapacitated by scandal. Instead of digging in their heels, state legislators who represent Camden should embrace the Whitman plan and improve on it.</p>
        <p>Camden's troubles began in the 1970's, when middle-class flight and job loss combined with corruption to undermine civic stability. Three of the last five mayors have faced federal charges and have presided over a government that has consistently failed to provide even the most basic city services. In recent years Camden residents have complained about undrinkable tap water, raw sewage in the streets, abandoned buildings and open-air drug bazaars, all threats to public safety.</p>

        <p>When bankrupt cities are taken over, it is usually by state-appointed control boards that dictate fiscal policy until the cities return to solvency. The board that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey has proposed for the dysfunctional city of Camden may be tough by New Jersey's standards but no tougher than the control boards that revived the prospects of municipalities like New York City, Chelsea, Mass., and, most recently, Washington. Camden's difficulty in governing itself was underscored recently when the City Council asked the state to assist in running the city attorney's office, which has been incapacitated by scandal. Instead of digging in their heels, state legislators who represent Camden should embrace the Whitman plan and improve on it.</p>
        <p>Camden's troubles began in the 1970's, when middle-class flight and job loss combined with corruption to undermine civic stability. Three of the last five mayors have faced federal charges and have presided over a government that has consistently failed to provide even the most basic city services. In recent years Camden residents have complained about undrinkable tap water, raw sewage in the streets, abandoned buildings and open-air drug bazaars, all threats to public safety.</p>
        <p>Critics of the Whitman takeover plan argue that the state is partly to blame, given that Camden has been under state supervision through an existing finance board that can question or veto decisions made by the city government. This arrangement has been ineffective, partly because the board is precluded from taking affirmative steps to deal with Camden's most pressing problems. As it stands today, the state is paying 70 percent of Camden's expenses and says it has spent $2 billion there over the last five years.</p>
        <p>The Whitman administration wants to ratchet up the state's authority through a chief management officer who would have broad powers during a period of civic ''rehabilitation.'' The manager could break contracts, ignore Civil Service rules in hiring and firing, issue or revoke licenses and direct all  appointments and spending decisions.</p>
        <p>The plan is vague on how long the takeover would remain in effect and what it should accomplish. But this can be clarified in the Legislature,  which should identify the circumstances under which the takeover would be lifted and power returned to local officials. This plan, however, should not become a license for permanently suspending democratically elected leadership.</p>
