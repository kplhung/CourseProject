        <p>The five-party system of Democrats, Republicans, Greens and two Reform parties is something new in American politics, and right now it is helping Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in important ways.</p>
        <p>The fracture in the Reform Party has dampened whatever slim hopes the ex-Republican Patrick J. Buchanan had for weakening Mr. Bush from the right. And the energetic campaign by the Green Party's Ralph Nader, at least for the moment, is helping Mr. Bush maintain his lead over Vice President Al Gore.</p>

        <p>The five-party system of Democrats, Republicans, Greens and two Reform parties is something new in American politics, and right now it is helping Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in important ways.</p>
        <p>The fracture in the Reform Party has dampened whatever slim hopes the ex-Republican Patrick J. Buchanan had for weakening Mr. Bush from the right. And the energetic campaign by the Green Party's Ralph Nader, at least for the moment, is helping Mr. Bush maintain his lead over Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Of course, the election is months away, and the fluctuations in the polls reinforce the impression that it is far from the minds of most Americans, even those who state a preference. And Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Nader have a potential for also hurting Mr. Bush -- Mr. Buchanan with social conservatives and Mr. Nader with die-hard campaign reform voters, the old John McCain crowd. But not yet.</p>
        <p>Remember last fall, when Mr. Buchanan's romancing of the Reform Party seemed to threaten Mr. Bush? Well, his need to reinvent himself as an authentic Reform Party man distanced him from his core anti-abortion, anti-homosexual, anti-immigrant base.</p>
        <p>And even though Mr. Buchanan tried to return to his first love on Thursday with a statement of social value principles, Mr. Bush has used the last 10 months to fill the conservatives' dance card, and stir their dreams of Supreme Court justices who would reverse Roe v. Wade.</p>
        <p>The impending dispute over who gets the Reform Party's $12.6 million in federal funds -- even if Mr. Buchanan ultimately prevails over his rival, John Hagelin -- means that he would be handicapped in using the money strategically. Lots of important television time has already been bought.</p>
        <p>Then there is Mr. Nader, ranging from 5 to 9 points in national polls and thus plainly able to tip some battleground states like Michigan, Washington, Wisconsin and maybe California to Mr. Bush by draining support from Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Of course, Mr. Nader and his backers say that is not their purpose. And Mr. Gore and his backers say that will not be the result.</p>
        <p>But the Gore folks are whistling past the graveyard. The threat to Mr. Gore is the real meaning of the Nader campaign.</p>
        <p>Right now there is no question that two-thirds or more of Mr. Nader's backers, in state after state, are coming out of the vice president's potential support. And some Gore backers outside his campaign recognize the problem.</p>
        <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the president of the Water Keeper Alliance and a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, wrote in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times on Thursday, ''A vote for Mr. Nader is a vote for Mr. Bush, and environmentalists who join his personal crusade risk marginalizing the conservation movement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader takes on that argument on two fronts. First, he says he is running to win, which is about as realistic as the defense by General Motors of the Corvair when Mr. Nader attacked it as unsafe in 1965.</p>
        <p>Second, he says that while Mr. Gore might be slightly better than Mr. Bush on the environment and a couple of other issues, the differences are too small to matter.</p>
        <p>Scholars of third parties, and the Gore campaign, argued that such candidacies always fade. Representative John B. Anderson of Illinois fell to 6 percent from 15 percent in 1980. Henry A. Wallace declined similarly in 1948.</p>
        <p>And even Ross Perot, the eccentric billionaire who founded the Reform Party in 1992, dropped to 19 percent on Election Day from about 33 percent, and after spending $56 million.</p>
        <p>John Bibby, a retired political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and a student of third parties, said: ''Nader looks like he could do respectably now. My guess is his vote would go down as you get closer to the election. The closer the election, the more significant is the wasted-vote argument.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bibby added, ''When it comes down to it, you want your vote to be meaningful.''</p>
        <p>A Gore strategist agreed, saying: ''I don't see Nader being like Perot in being able to communicate. He won't spend $56 million.'' And the strategist argued, ''As people get to know Gore better, I think it's going to make it a lot easier to see him as someone who fights for people and will be on their side.''</p>
        <p>But a Republican strategist was unconvinced, arguing that Mr. Nader would hold on to enough support to be a factor.</p>
        <p>''He has a longstanding reputation among a core group of voters,'' the strategist said, adding that because Mr. Nader is known as a consumer advocate, he ''gets a little bit of an earned media ride, too.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader, and Mr. Buchanan, argue that their differences from the Republicans and Democrats are enabling them to make voters out of nonvoters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader sometimes argues that even if Mr. Gore loses, the Green Party's efforts will help elect more Democrats to the House, and make Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri the next speaker.</p>
        <p>But that is what third party candidates always say. Curtis Gans, head of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, said he saw only ''a slight chance that Nader will stir some increase among young people,'' and no indication that he was bringing in other potential voters.</p>
        <p>Thomas Patterson, head of a Harvard study of ''The Vanishing Voter'' that uses weekly polling to learn what is behind low participation, said he saw no evidence that either Mr. Nader or Mr. Buchanan ''really seems to be popping'' and exciting voters.</p>
        <p>But even if that does not happen, there is another group for Mr. Nader to concentrate on -- the Perot voter who reacted in 1992 to the Texan's criticism of the way campaign cash and lobbying fees dictate results in Washington.</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. Nader started showing a television commercial (with an authentic old politics touch, his staff refused to say where the modest buy was taking place or how much was spent). It parodied recent advertisements for MasterCard with lines like ''Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: One thousand dollars a plate'' and ''Finding out the truth: priceless.''</p>
        <p>But clever as that ad is, the Nader campaign said it plans to spend no more than $5 million on commercials for the entire campaign.</p>
        <p>And while ads for which little time was bought, like the Willie Horton commercial to promote Mr. Bush's father in 1988, have sometimes become effective by being repeated on news programs, there is no indication that will happen with Mr. Nader's commercials.</p>
        <p>The only real money available for the outsider candidates is the $12.6 million for the Reform Party. Even if Mr. Buchanan gets it, the Bush campaign dismisses him as meaningless.</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said: ''The sun has set on Pat Buchanan's candidacy and will not rise again. Pat Buchanan is old news.''</p>
        <p>Still, if the Federal Election Commission can speed up its normal pace and get a check in the mail before the 2004 campaign, Mr. Buchanan could be at least an annoyance.</p>
        <p>Sandy Maisel, who along with Mr. Bibby wrote the book ''Two Parties or More,'' in 1998, said he thought if Mr. Buchanan spent his money wisely, in a few small states with big anti-abortion movements, he might still matter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maisel, a professor of government at Colby College, said Mr. Nader might fade faster.</p>
        <p>''I think there is more ideological zealotry on the part of the anti-abortion people than there is on the part of labor and the environmentalists,'' he said.</p>
