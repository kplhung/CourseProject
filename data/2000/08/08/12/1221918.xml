        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton's assertion that she played a quiet but major role in several policy and legislative efforts by the Clinton administration cannot be trusted and stems from a bid to ''reinvent'' herself for voters, Representative Rick A. Lazio said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''My sense is this is just another attempt to reinvent Hillary Clinton and that is why the people of New York have such a problem with credibility when it comes to the Clinton campaign,'' Mr. Lazio, who is running against Mrs. Clinton for a United States Senate seat from New York, said in an interview yesterday after returning from a cross-country fund-raising tour.</p>

        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton's assertion that she played a quiet but major role in several policy and legislative efforts by the Clinton administration cannot be trusted and stems from a bid to ''reinvent'' herself for voters, Representative Rick A. Lazio said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''My sense is this is just another attempt to reinvent Hillary Clinton and that is why the people of New York have such a problem with credibility when it comes to the Clinton campaign,'' Mr. Lazio, who is running against Mrs. Clinton for a United States Senate seat from New York, said in an interview yesterday after returning from a cross-country fund-raising tour.</p>
        <p>''She either was not forthcoming and not sincere when she said she had nothing to do with these things all these years,'' Mr. Lazio said, ''or she is communicating a very different approach to things now. It seems to me there is a serious credibility gap here.''</p>
        <p>In an article yesterday in The New York Times, Mrs. Clinton said that contrary to what she and the White House previously had said, she played an active role in proposing, lobbying and writing legislation after her failure to overhaul health care in 1994.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said she cloaked her role and learned to be more subtle in dealing with legislators on Capitol Hill after her blueprint for a national universal health care program was defeated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said he had voted for several of the bills that Mrs. Clinton now says she engineered or pushed. The legislation he supported -- through what his aides said were his moderate views and belief in bipartisanship -- included bills to create the Corporation for National Service, a domestic version of the Peace Corps, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides $24 billion over five years to states to insure children.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazio said he was unaware of any role Mrs. Clinton played in any legislation, and suggested she overstated her influence.</p>
        <p>Democrats and some Republicans in Congress supported Mrs. Clinton's version of events, but a few Republicans said she took too much credit for legislation they in fact sponsored.</p>
        <p>''I have served for eight years,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''I have been as active a legislator as anyone has been. I sat at the leadership table and I am a leader among moderate Republicans, who would be the first people aware of any attempt to work in bipartisanship on something. I am aware of zero involvement by Mrs. Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said Mr. Lazio had a poor record on credibility, citing Mr. Lazio's initial denial of writing a fund-raising letter in July that Mr. Wolfson said contained ''insults.''  Mr. Lazio, after some equivocation, stood by the letter, which bore his signature.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio spoke by phone after returning from a 14-city trip this week, his first such cross-country tour. It included stops in Cincinnati, Las Vegas; the Los Angeles area; Salt Lake City; Portland, Ore.; Jackson, Wyo.; and, yesterday, Bloomington, Minn.</p>
        <p>Aides said he raised more than $1 million at the fund-raisers, held mostly in private homes and sponsored by an array of supporters, including fellow members of Congress.</p>
