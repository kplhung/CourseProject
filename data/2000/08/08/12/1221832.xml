        <p>France's transportation minister reiterated today that Air France's five remaining Concordes would stay grounded for the time being because of continuing uncertainty about why the supersonic jet caught fire last month and crashed north of Paris.</p>
        <p>The minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, issued a statement after meeting with investigators looking into the cause of the crash. He said they told him they believed that ''the initial cause of the accident is the destruction of the internal forward tire of the main left wheel carriage.'' The tire's destruction, he said, produced ''catastrophic consequences in a very brief period of time.''</p>

        <p>France's transportation minister reiterated today that Air France's five remaining Concordes would stay grounded for the time being because of continuing uncertainty about why the supersonic jet caught fire last month and crashed north of Paris.</p>
        <p>The minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, issued a statement after meeting with investigators looking into the cause of the crash. He said they told him they believed that ''the initial cause of the accident is the destruction of the internal forward tire of the main left wheel carriage.'' The tire's destruction, he said, produced ''catastrophic consequences in a very brief period of time.''</p>
        <p>The minister's statement came one day after investigators from the Bureau of Accident Investigations confirmed that a 16-inch strip of metal found on the runway after the crash had punctured one of the jet's tires, turning chunks of rubber into fast-flying projectiles that allowed a major fuel leak and fire to occur before the plane even left the runway.</p>
        <p>Almost from the beginning, French investigators have been working on the broad assumption that at least one tire burst, triggering a chain of events that included damage to the plane's structure, a fire and engine failure that led to the crash. But Mr. Gayssot said today that investigators still do not know the sequence of those events or how they might have been connected or ultimately caused the fire.</p>
        <p>The crash, shortly after takeoff on July 25, killed 113 people.</p>
