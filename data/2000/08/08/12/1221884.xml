        <p>Reinforcing suspicions that a suicidal co-pilot was responsible for the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 last fall, the nation's top air safety investigator said today that there were no safety issues in the crash that would require a public hearing to resolve.</p>
        <p>At a news conference, the official, James E.

        <p>Reinforcing suspicions that a suicidal co-pilot was responsible for the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 last fall, the nation's top air safety investigator said today that there were no safety issues in the crash that would require a public hearing to resolve.</p>
        <p>At a news conference, the official, James E. Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, released 1,700 pages of documents, including F.B.I. reports that showed that the co-pilot had been accused of a variety of sexual improprieties at a Manhattan hotel during visits there in the year before the crash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall drew no conclusion from the reports and said the board had not yet analyzed the information it had gathered.</p>
        <p>The investigation of the crash, which killed 217 people last October when the Cairo-bound Boeing 767 went down in the Atlantic Ocean off Nantucket, became an international problem for the United States almost immediately. When some investigators indicated early in the board's 10-month investigation that it suspected that a co-pilot had deliberately crashed the plane, Egyptian officials reacted with outrage and demanded a broader investigation of the airplane's flight control systems.</p>
        <p>They strongly denied suggestions that the co-pilot, Gamil al-Batouti,  grabbed the controls and put the plane into a steep dive.</p>
        <p>That the matter remains sensitive was evident today in the fact that safety board officials emphasized that they had still not reached any final conclusions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall said there were ''no unresolved safety issues'' that would require a formal public hearing, which is usually held after a major crash. A final report is months away.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hall also said, without elaboration, that the board thought the F.B.I. witness reports were relevant and should be included. The agency's files show that Mr. Batouti was the subject of numerous complaints at the Pennsylvania Hotel at 407 Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, where EgyptAir crews stayed.</p>
        <p>Several women who worked at the hotel told security officers that Mr. Batouti repeatedly propositioned them sexually. In another incident, two teenage girls accused Mr. Batouti of following them and exposing himself through a window.</p>
        <p>Several people interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation described Mr. Batouti as a moody loner. One said he saw him drunk several times and thought of him as ''a tragedy waiting to happen.''</p>
        <p>Another said Mr. Batouti was ''a religious person who was like 'a kid in a candy store' when in New York City,'' because he was unaccustomed to seeing women in relatively revealing clothing.</p>
        <p>The files show that EgyptAir was notified of the complaints by the hotel, and that Mr. Batouti consistently denied them, accusing the hotel of harassing him.</p>
        <p>American experts representing EgyptAir, including a former safety board chairman, said the documents contained extensive evidence that argued against the crash being a murder-suicide.</p>
        <p>Other parts of the F.B.I. files back up the assertion of family members and friends who have defended Mr. Batouti. Several people interviewed on the West Coast, where he also traveled for EgyptAir, described him as pleasant and sociable, considerate of others and looking forward to retirement to spend more time with his family.</p>
        <p>The docket released today also included the transcript of the cockpit voice recorder, which, as previously reported, showed that Mr. Batouti had repeatedly uttered a religious phrase in the moments before the crash. The common Arabic phrase, ''Tawakilt ala Allah,'' translated as ''I rely on God,'' could be heard 11 times in the last minute and a half of the tape.</p>
        <p>By law, the board releases only a transcript, not a copy of the tape itself, but one person who has heard the tape described the phrase being repeated ''like a mantra.''</p>
        <p>But Adel Fouad, an Egyptian psychiatric consultant to the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority, in a letter submitted to the Safety Board and released today with its reports, said that the phrase reflected an Islamic belief that humans are supported and controlled by God, and that the phrase ''is used only when one embarks on a good action and not a bad one.''</p>
        <p>The board said in a footnote disclaimer that Dr. Fouad's statement was not developed using board procedures and that his views were ''not necessarily''' the board's.</p>
        <p>Demonstrating the significance of the phrase to the investigation, a committee of experts analyzed each  of the utterances for their acoustic qualities.</p>
        <p>Experts in language and behavior say that people under stress talk faster. The analysis found that the first utterance was the longest, 1.02 seconds. But the utterances did not become progressively more panicked, as the plane's fatal dive continued, varying from 0.73 to 0.87 seconds each, which the committee called ''relatively regular.''</p>
        <p>The transcript catches the crew members complaining about the airline and about each other.</p>
        <p>Shortly after takeoff, Mr. Batouti used his seniority to oust the junior co-pilot, Adel Anwar, scheduled to be on duty for that leg of the flight. Mr. Anwar, 36, expressed surprise that Mr. Batouti was not resting in the rear, a more typical routine for a relief co-pilot early in the flight.</p>
        <p>''Let me tell you something,'' Mr. Batouti replied. ''I'm not going to sleep at all. I might come back and sit for two hours, and then. . . .''</p>
        <p>Mr. Anwar indicated he himself was well rested and happy to stay in his regular seat.</p>
        <p>''You mean you're not going to get up?'' Mr. Batouti said. ''You will get up. . . .''</p>
        <p>Mr. Anwar protested: ''You should have told me. You should have told me this, Captain Gamil.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Anwar later complained to the captain about Mr. Batouti, saying: ''He does whatever he pleases. Some days he doesn't work at all.''</p>
        <p>The crash was in international waters, and the plane, a Boeing 767, was registered in Egypt, which by treaty would put the Egyptian Government in charge of the investigation. But Egypt delegated the job to the United States.</p>
        <p>The safety board will not establish a probable cause of the crash for months, and after that, the Egyptian Government will have 60 days to review the report before it is made public. But in another indication of the board's thinking, the crash has resulted in just one formal recommendation thus far, for video cameras in the cockpits of commercial airliners, to join the microphones that have been standard for decades.</p>
        <p>It was clear again today that the Egyptian side was uncomfortable with the results of the inquiry to date.</p>
        <p>An Egyptian investigator, Capt. Mohsen el-Missiry of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, said pointedly, ''Additional work remains to be done, particularly in assessing the design of the Boeing 767 elevator control system.''</p>
        <p>The board's position is that it will listen to arguments from participants about what should happen next, but that, for now at least, it believes that it has completed all the necessary investigative work, leaving it ready to turn to analysis.</p>
        <p>At the news conference, at one point an Egyptian reporter asked Mr. Hall why the accusations of sexual misconduct were relevant to the cause of the crash, and then he began discussing President Clinton's sexual activities in the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall replied that ''we are very aware of the important responsibility that we have to the victims'' to perform a thorough, fair investigation, and then said, ''The statements you refer to are a very small portion of this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall was clearly being careful. He responded to the question about why there would be no public hearing on the crash by reading from a prepared response. He said the board's staff had ''recommended that a hearing not be held on this crash because they believe there are no unresolved safety issues that require such a forum.''</p>
        <p>And asked how his assertion today that the board had made no conclusions on the crash squared with his statement on Nov. 15, that the board was considering turning the case over to the F.B.I. because the crash might be a crime, he simply referred the questioner to a statement posted on the safety board's Web site. (The statement, on Nov. 19, said that after consultation with the F.B.I. and the Egyptians, the board concluded that more work had to be done.)</p>
        <p>In fact, many staff investigators are convinced that the crash was a suicide and are eager to move on to other mysteries.</p>
        <p>Board officials said today that they would let the documents they had released speak for themselves. But those documents formed a sort of Rorschach test, with experts hired by the Egyptian side drawing contradictory conclusions from the material, which, like much evidence in crash reports, was ambiguous in some places.</p>
        <p>For example, EgyptAir believes Mr. Batouti was never alone in the cockpit; safety board investigators believe he was.</p>
        <p>Twelve minutes before the end of the recording, the cockpit tape captures three syllables.</p>
        <p>The five Arabic-speaking people who helped prepare the transcript agree it was not an Arabic word; four of them believe they heard words similar to ''control it.'' One English-speaking member of the committee thought it might be ''hydraulic.'' Five others say it is unintelligible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall said that writing a transcript of a half-hour tape, complete with analysis of cockpit sounds, usually took 16 hours, but that this one took 130.</p>
        <p>Carl Vogt, a former safety board chairman and a lawyer here who now represents the Egyptians, pointed out that according to data released today, the tail elevators, the devices that change the plane's pitch, never moved to the maximum extent they are able to, indicating that the dive was not deliberate.</p>
        <p>And, Mr. Vogt noted, the flight data recorder captures someone in the cockpit cutting engine power.</p>
        <p>''When the nose of your airplane goes down, to maintain constant airspeed and not accelerate, you always pull off power,'' Mr. Vogt said. ''That to me is compelling evidence against any intent to do anything but preserve the airplane and fly it.''</p>
        <p>Some government investigators  say, however, that they do not understand why someone -- presumably Mr. Batouti -- turned off both engines as the plane screamed toward the water, approaching the speed of sound.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Vogt made another point that other pilots have also raised, that diving is not the fastest or surest way to crash a plane.</p>
        <p>''You'd turn the thing over, and apply power to make it go faster,'' he said. ''This flight crew maintained wings level.''</p>
        <p>FROM THE VOICE RECORDER  Transcript of Cockpit Conversation on EgyptAir Flight 990</p>
