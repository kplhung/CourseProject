        <p>The highest-ranking United Nations official responsible for refugees plans to retire at the end of the year, and a race is on to find a replacement within the next month or two.</p>
        <p>Several candidates seem willing to take on the job, even though it is being redefined by an era of civil wars whose combatants have often turned their guns on aid workers.</p>
        <p>With more than 30 million people driven from their homes and needing help in Europe, Africa and Asia, the job of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees has become one of the world's most difficult.</p>
        <p>For almost a decade -- through conflicts from Bosnia to Congo to East Timor -- the position has been held by Sadako Ogata of Japan, who studied at Georgetown and Berkeley and was dean of foreign studies at Sophia University in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>During her tenure, Mrs. Ogata said in a recent interview, she has been forced to be fund-raiser, logistics expert, security provider and administrator of a large bureaucracy, all the while trying to pursue and protect her primary role of refugee advocate. Based in Geneva, she has perennially been on the move from crisis to crisis.</p>
        <p>Often she has had to defend her agency against critics who say that it moves too slowly, as in the Kosovo crisis, or that it fails to stop combatants from supplying themselves in refugee camps, as in Congo.</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan will choose Mrs. Ogata's replacement after he consults with various governments. The General Assembly will then consider his choice. United Nations officials and diplomats say Mr. Annan hoped to have a candidate by early October but is still seeking nominees.</p>
        <p>Although there is no formal, public list of candidates, diplomats say nearly half a dozen people are considered serious contenders, if not always by the same backers. American diplomats say they have not decided which candidate to support.</p>
        <p>An early nominee was Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan, brother of the late King Hussein and a close informal adviser to Mrs. Ogata.</p>
        <p>Two possible candidates from within the United Nations system are Sergio Vieira de Mello, the organization's coordinator of humanitarian affairs and now administrator of East Timor, and Bernard Kouchner, the United Nations administrator of Kosovo and founder of Doctors Without Borders.</p>
        <p>Europeans see Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek of Norway as a strong nominee. In the last year, Mr. Vollebaek has played a role in monitoring the conflict in Chechnya on behalf of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. He has also tried to broker peace talks between the government of Sri Lanka and Tamil rebels waging war in the country's northeast.</p>
        <p>Lloyd Axworthy, who is expected to step down soon as Canada's foreign minister, is a possible dark-horse candidate. Mr. Axworthy has given relief issues a high priority in Canadian foreign policy and was very active in international campaigns to ban land mines and establish an international criminal court.</p>
        <p>Another candidate, Maahti Atisaari, a former president of Finland, was a leading contender until he withdrew from the race early this summer. Mr. Atisaari has told officials he prefers to remain in Finland and serve the United Nations on shorter special assignments from there. But some diplomats say he might be persuaded to reconsider.</p>
