        <p>At one time America's presidential conventions earned the nation's attention for the important purposes of choosing leadership tickets and defining party principles. But today's political extravaganzas survive for the more modern purpose of providing a few video images and catch phrases that can be marketed throughout the fall. Distilled down to their essence, the Republican and Democratic conventions this summer are photo opportunities built around balloon drops, confetti storms, sound bites from acceptance speeches, and climactic tableaus of the nominees with their families, defeated opponents and Congressional allies. Even in a political system built to accommodate change, the role of national conventions has evolved -- some would say declined -- rapidly.</p>
        <p>Just over a half-century ago the Dixiecrat walkout kept Democrats in front of their radios. Four years later, Republicans were riveted by the televised nomination battle between Dwight Eisenhower and Robert Taft. The last presidential convention that kept delegates and television viewers on the edge of their seats was in 1976, when an interloper from California, Ronald Reagan, nearly edged out the incumbent president, Gerald Ford, for the nomination. In that year about 32 percent of American households watched on one of only a few channels. Now, with more than 60 channels available to most Americans, George W. Bush's big night with his grand finale speech reached about half that percentage of homes.</p>

        <p>At one time America's presidential conventions earned the nation's attention for the important purposes of choosing leadership tickets and defining party principles. But today's political extravaganzas survive for the more modern purpose of providing a few video images and catch phrases that can be marketed throughout the fall. Distilled down to their essence, the Republican and Democratic conventions this summer are photo opportunities built around balloon drops, confetti storms, sound bites from acceptance speeches, and climactic tableaus of the nominees with their families, defeated opponents and Congressional allies. Even in a political system built to accommodate change, the role of national conventions has evolved -- some would say declined -- rapidly.</p>
        <p>Just over a half-century ago the Dixiecrat walkout kept Democrats in front of their radios. Four years later, Republicans were riveted by the televised nomination battle between Dwight Eisenhower and Robert Taft. The last presidential convention that kept delegates and television viewers on the edge of their seats was in 1976, when an interloper from California, Ronald Reagan, nearly edged out the incumbent president, Gerald Ford, for the nomination. In that year about 32 percent of American households watched on one of only a few channels. Now, with more than 60 channels available to most Americans, George W. Bush's big night with his grand finale speech reached about half that percentage of homes.</p>
        <p>Surely the decline in audience is due at least in part to the fact that real political battles no longer occur at these meetings. Indeed, politicians view a news eruption as a mistake in convention planning. Evidence for their view is provided by Patrick Buchanan, who damaged the Republican Party in 1992 with his rabid rhetoric and now appears to be helping the Reform Party remake itself into two inconsequential parties rather than only one.</p>
        <p>Despite the retro-show from the hapless Reformers, we are far removed from the day when Walter Cronkite and other broadcast grandees were beamed into millions of living rooms in the role of convention hosts. Fading, too, is the guaranteed air time for big-name speakers. In Philadelphia, for example, ABC broadcast its commentary about Colin Powell's speech while Mr. Powell was still giving it. Dwindling air time on the networks reflects something beyond a decline in real news. It also involves a cost-driven shift of political coverage toward cable and the Internet, leaving the broadcasters free to sell advertising around their entertainment programming.</p>
        <p>But it is too early to tell if there is anything approaching a one-to-one shift of political audience  from old to newer media. One rough estimate from Nielsen Media experts suggests that the overall television audience for the G.O.P. convention dropped as much as 12 percent from 1996. Some other analysts of this new data suspect that as sites offering news expand, news seekers actually retreat, perhaps overwhelmed with political detail from so many different sources. A few political Internet sites even reported drops in activity during the Republican convention.</p>
        <p>Despite NBC's promotion of MSNBC as the cable channel with deeper convention news, MSNBC finished the Republican week with fewer than 600,000 viewers per night. Perhaps the network's viewers have made the same choice as the networks -- that entertainment must sometimes rank above civic duty, especially during prime time.</p>
        <p>The demand by Jim Nicholson, the Republican chairman, that the networks devote ''not a minute more'' to the Democratic Convention than they did to the G.O.P. gathering is clearly ludicrous. The Democrats' more surprising vice-presidential choice and the drama of President Clinton's farewell will probably mean expansion of air time over the tightly scripted and predictable G.O.P. show.</p>
        <p>But in the larger sense, there is no quick fix to restoring the air time and audience that conventions once commanded. Recapturing the drama of the brokered convention would require taking power away from primary voters and giving it back to party bosses, an unhealthy step for democracy. But the lesson of the under-watched conventions of 2000 may be that it is time for the national parties to find new ways to make them vital exercises in political communication, rather than ritualized performances of outdated ceremonies.</p>
