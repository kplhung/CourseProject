        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>SAYING NO TO GORE -- Representative Ken Lucas of Kentucky, one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, said yesterday that he would not vote for Vice President Al Gore at the Democratic National Convention next week and might not support the ticket in November. Mr. Lucas, a freshman congressman from a traditionally Republican district, disagrees with Mr. Gore on such issues as abortion, gun control and tobacco policy. ''Personally, I like Al Gore and I think he made an excellent choice in Joe Lieberman as his running mate, but these are issues I feel very strongly about,'' Mr. Lucas said. Since he has been in Congress, Mr. Lucas has refused to greet either President Clinton or Mr. Gore when they have come to the Cincinnati area, which is just across the state line from his district.</p>

        <p>THE PROTESTS</p>
        <p>NO WARRANT, NO SEARCH -- Judge Dean D. Pregerson of Federal District Court ordered Los Angeles police yesterday to stay out of the headquarters of protesters gearing up for the Democratic National Convention unless they had a search warrant or there were urgent circumstances. The decision came in response to a request by the American Civil Liberties Union, which said the activists' headquarters west of downtown was the object of unconstitutional harassment. Carol Sobel, a lawyer for the A.C.L.U., told the judge that the headquarters had been hit with helicopter spotlights as often as 50 times a night, and Fire Department officials, accompanied by the police, have inspected the building several times.</p>
        <p>''It's meant to have an intimidating effect,'' Ms. Sobel said. ''It's part of the chill.'' She said that large puppets being prepared by protesters were a target of the police, who are concerned that the puppets could be used to conceal weapons. The deputy city attorney, Debra Gonzales, said there would be no seizing of puppets ''as long as the puppet is what it is.''</p>

        <p>A DIFFERENT CONVENTION COMES TO TOWN -- Anarchists, accused by Los Angeles officials of planning violent protests during the Democratic National Convention, began their own conference in the city yesterday, expecting to draw 1,000 people. Organizers of the North American Anarchist Conference urged people to avoid discussing protest plans. Drugs, alcohol and weapons were also barred. ''We don't want any possible excuse for shutting us down,'' an activist, Brendan Crill, told conferencegoers. ''There probably are police infiltrators around, so be careful what you talk about.''</p>
        <p>Reporters were banned from using recording equipment, and some people arrived with bandanas covering their faces in case the police were videotaping them. Organizers said they had an evacuation plan in case of a police raid. The conference, which is taking place not far from the Los Angeles Police Academy, was held on a shoestring, although attendees were asked to give a $25 donation. At least one would-be delegate was heard to argue, ''We don't believe in money.''</p>
