        <p>The departures are the talk of station house hallways. In a matter of days, the New York Police Department will be losing its commissioner, Howard Safir, and his second in command, Patrick Kelleher. Within weeks, the deputy commissioner who directs narcotics enforcement will be leaving, as will the chief who supervises police hiring.</p>
        <p>But those departures, however high profile, are only part of a larger surge in retirements by police officers this year.</p>
        <p>In the first seven months of 2000, 703 police officers of various ranks have filed for retirement, a 38 percent increase over the same period last year. Police Department officials say this represents but a trickle in a department with 40,000 officers, but leaders of the their unions say it is the beginning of a major exodus, as officers hand in their badges to pursue better-paying, less dangerous jobs where no one calls them names.</p>
        <p>''We predicted this would occur back six or seven years ago,'' said Capt. John Driscoll, president of the Captains Endowment Association, a union representing many supervisory officers. Police officials ''chose to ignore it because everybody felt that, by the time it became a big problem, they would be retired,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The reasons for this retirement surge are many. But two leading factors are the lure of private-sector jobs in a booming economy and the discontent many officers feel after several years of heightened criticism and pay that lags behind that of some of their suburban counterparts. And police officials attribute a large part of the increase to the number of officers who became eligible for retirement in the last two years.</p>
        <p>If the trend continues, the Police Department will have to recruit enough officers to replace the retirees if it is going to maintain the current size of the patrol force. That could be daunting, given the results of recent recruitment drives.</p>
        <p>In New York, as in cities around the country, interest in police careers has fallen. Even with an unprecedented $10 million recruiting campaign by the New York Police Department last year, only 15,000 people signed up to take the qualifying test. Although many of the candidates were city residents, which the department had identified as a prime goal, that number was only half the number of candidates who had signed up for the same exam three years earlier.</p>
        <p>This summer, recruiters have had a hard time finding people to fill the next Police Academy class, which has 1,589 slots and is scheduled to begin training late next month. ''At this point we are working very hard to get to that number,'' said Inspector George Anderson of the personnel bureau.</p>
        <p>Compounding the problem is the fact that the number of officers eligible for retirement -- those who have completed 20 years of service -- is about to jump sharply. In the mid-1990's, very few officers became eligible for retirement because virtually none were hired two decades before, during the city's fiscal crisis. Even this year, only 419 officers who were hired in 1980 are scheduled to complete their 20th year.</p>
        <p>But beginning next year, thousands of officers who were hired in the early 1980's as the city began to rebuild its force will be eligible to retire with a pension equal to half their salary. Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the union that represents police officers, said he thought that most of the newly eligible officers would choose to retire. ''Police officers are not staying on this job,'' he said. ''That's a firm bet.''</p>
        <p>Police officials have characterized that sort of statement as union bluster intended to gain leverage at the bargaining table, where the union is seeking a new contract with a sizable wage increase. A rookie officer is now paid $31,428 a year, and typically earns about $3,000 more in overtime, holiday pay and a differential applied for working the night shift.</p>
        <p>Department officials said they did not believe that widespread departures were imminent. Rather, they said, they have made the sorts of adjustments, like an expansion in the number of captain positions so as to create promotion opportunities, that would help prevent an exodus.</p>
        <p>Police officials say the recent rise in retirements seems startling only because it follows several years in which retirements fell. In 1998, for example, 617 officers, of all ranks, retired from the department. Last year, the number of retirements rose to 888. Officials project that the number will exceed 1,200 this year.</p>
        <p>But the increase in retirements cannot be completely explained by the rise in the number of officers who have become eligible. Indeed, over the last two years, the rate of retirement has outpaced the rate at which officers have become eligible.</p>
        <p>Retirement has become a particularly attractive option in New York because the pension system, as now formulated, rewards people who retire. Most officers who retire can bring home almost as much money as they did walking a beat.</p>
        <p>With tax breaks and a special benefit known as the variable supplement fund, which provides retired officers with $8,500 a year on top of their pension, officers often find that their yearly take-home pay is only several thousand dollars less than what they were earning on the job.  And those interested in starting a second career could make a windfall compared with what they would have made had they stayed on the job.</p>
        <p>''It is not good to lose a large number of veteran officers,'' said Thomas A. Reppetto, author of ''NYPD: A City and Its Police'' (Henry Holt &amp; Company, 2000), ''and some police departments have tried to counter this by making it very attractive for veteran officers to stay, by raising their pay or giving them enhanced status.''</p>
        <p>Some departments are also trying to bolster their manpower by heavily recruiting for officers in New York City. Police forces from sunny climes like Los Angeles and Las Vegas now make efforts to lure New York officers a prime part of their recruiting strategy, which has only added to the obstacles facing police officials in New York. ''We are going to look at as many strategies as we can to make sure we get the candidates that we need to take our test,'' said Inspector Anderson of the personnel bureau.</p>
        <p>One of the city's new strategies was unveiled Thursday: a $10 million advertising campaign with a compelling story line that features people like the actor Ray Romano, of the television comedy ''Everybody Loves Raymond.'' In one ad, he speaks with admiration about his brother, a New York police sergeant. ''I may get the attention,'' Mr. Romano says of his brother, ''but he's the one who deserves it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Romano's brother, Sgt. Richard Romano, ended up receiving quite a bit of attention, however, at the news conference announcing the campaign. In remarks to reporters at the event, Sergeant Romano said that as much as he loved his job and the department, he was retiring next month. ''I've done 20 years on the streets,'' he said, ''and every man has his point where he says it's his breaking point.''</p>
