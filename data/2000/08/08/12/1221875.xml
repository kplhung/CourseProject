        <p>The News Corporation, which owns the Fox television network, has agreed to acquire Chris-Craft Industries, the TV-station company, for $3.5 billion, a person close to the discussions said last night.</p>
        <p>Chris-Craft, which is controlled by Herbert J. Siegel, 72, owns 10 television stations, while the News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, owns 22 stations.</p>
        <p>The News Corporation is expected to pay $85 a share, a 21 percent premium to the price of Chris-Craft stock earlier in the week.</p>
        <p>Viacom abruptly announced yesterday that merger talks with Chris-Craft had broken down, sending shares of Chris-Craft plummeting $8, to $62. Then, after the market closed, Chris-Craft said it was in talks with another company.</p>
        <p>The competition to acquire TV-station companies has been intense. Viacom, which owns stations and the UPN network, has been negotiating on and off for several years to acquire the Chris-Craft stations.</p>
        <p>''We liked the assets, but only at a price,'' Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom, said last night. ''The price wasn't right, and we decided to walk.''</p>
        <p>Such a merger would put tremendous control of TV stations into Mr. Murdoch's hands. For one thing, the News Corporation already owns WNYW, Channel 5, in New York. The purchase of Chris-Craft would bring him WWOR, Channel 9, a UPN affiliate. That raises the issue of whether Mr. Murdoch would shut UPN out of the New York market. The News Corporation would also own two stations in Los Angeles, as well as in Phoenix and Salt Lake City.</p>
        <p>Until last year, the Federal Communications Commission did not permit the ownership of two stations in a single market. The F.C.C. still limits station groups to ownership of stations that cover no more than 35 percent of the nation's households.</p>
        <p>Under rules adopted in August 1999, the F.C.C. allows dual ownership in cities where there are a sufficient number of ''media voices,'' which include all radio and television stations, large daily newspapers and cable systems. Specifically, a city must have at least eight independently owned TV stations for a single company to own two. And a company cannot own more than one of the four top-rated stations in any market.</p>
        <p>The ownership of two stations in a single market is not counted twice in terms of reach.</p>
        <p>Should the deal go through, it would also give the News Corporation control of BHC Communications, of which Chris-Craft owns 80 percent. BHC operates very-high-frequency and ultra-high-frequency TV stations. It has a market value of $3.18 billion. There are 4.5 million shares outstanding. BHC in turn owns 58 percent of United Television.</p>
        <p>Last year, Chris-Craft tried to sell Viacom all its stations and its half-interest in UPN. But Viacom thought the price was too high. Viacom walked away from the deal and told Chris-Craft that it would exercise a clause that allowed it to either buy Chris-Craft's half-interest in UPN or sell its own half-interest to Chris-Craft. Chris-Craft was then forced to sell its half-interest to Viacom.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, there was a second round of negotiations on the stations, and Viacom walked away again, thinking the price was too high.</p>
        <p>Chris-Craft owns 10 stations: WWOR in Secaucus, N.J.; KCOP, Los Angeles; KPTV, Portland, Ore.; KBHK, San Francisco; KMSP, Minneapolis-St. Paul; KUTP, Phoenix; WRBW, Orlando, Fla.; WUTB, Baltimore; KTVX, Salt Lake City; and KMOL, San Antonio.</p>
        <p>There have long been reports that Mr. Siegel would sell the company, but no deal materialized. And some people in the entertainment industry said they felt he was reluctant to let it go because both his sons, Bill and John, work at Chris-Craft.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Siegel seemed conflicted about a sale, he was also conflicted about expanding his company, seeing all acquisitions and many investments as too expensive. ''To take the money and buy something that does not earn as much as government bonds do is not a smart move,'' Mr. Siegel said in 1997. Mr. Siegel declined to comment last night.</p>
        <p>The News Corporation is paying about 17 times cash flow, a relatively large multiple by industry standards, said Scott Davis, who follows Chris-Craft for First Union Securities. However, the company may feel that there is room to improve profitability, he said.</p>
        <p>''With operating margins of about 30 percent, the stations generally underperform the industry, where margins tend to be in the 40 percent range,'' he said, adding that the News Corporation gets about $1.5 billion that is on the balance sheet.</p>
        <p>The News Corporation was already the largest station owner in the country. Now that it will exceed the legal limits of the television reach, the question is whether the company will have to sell some stations or push the F.C.C. to expand ownership limitations.</p>
