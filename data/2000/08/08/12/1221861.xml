        <p>A Queens man who earlier this week shot and killed his supervisor in the housekeeping unit of a state-owned nursing home shot himself yesterday morning, perhaps by using the same gun, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The man, Steven Robinson, 40, was in stable condition at Jamaica Hospital in Queens, where he is being held in police custody. Mr. Robinson is facing second-degree murder charges in the killing of Elizabeth Parker, 58, at the New York State Veterans Home in St. Albans.</p>
        <p>The police had been searching for Mr. Robinson since Tuesday afternoon, when, they said, he shot Ms. Parker in her basement office in the culmination of what co-workers described as more than a year of mounting tension between the two.</p>
        <p>Yesterday at about 7:30 a.m., Mr. Robinson called the police from a pay telephone near the corner of Baisley Boulevard and Lakeview Lane in Queens. Still standing on the corner, he shot himself in the head with a .22-caliber handgun, the same type of gun that was used to kill Ms. Parker, the police said. They are investigating whether he used the same weapon.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said that Mr. Robinson would be arraigned after his hospital release.</p>
        <p>After Tuesday's shooting, Mr. Robinson fled the nursing home on a mountain bike, arriving at the Jamaica home of his father, Willie Robinson, 71, the authorities said. Mr. Robinson, who is a pastor at St. John's Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in St. Albans, told reporters at the time that his son had confessed to killing Ms. Parker.</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning, the pastor was planning to meet at the church with several other pastors to discuss ways to persuade his son, who he thought was still at large, to turn himself in to the police. But Mr. Robinson said that before that meeting took place, a friend called to report that he had read a news item on the Internet saying that Steven Robinson had shot himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson said that his son, who has been arrested six times for nonviolent, drug-related offenses, was straightening out his life and had refrained from using drugs in the last six years.</p>
