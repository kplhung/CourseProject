        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Asian-Americans and AIDS'' (editorial, Aug. 10): That Asian-Americans lack information about AIDS because of the scarcity of linguistically and culturally relevant educational materials is one example of a larger issue: Asian-Americans are excluded from many health care communications programs.</p>
        <p>Your editorial points out that community groups are leading these educational efforts with state and federal financing and that more assistance is needed. Yet the same can also be said for many other diseases that are prevalent in the Asian-American population.</p>

        <p>The pharmaceutical industry could help solve this problem. If only a tiny fraction of the more than $1 billion spent annually by direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical marketers were diverted to programs tailored for Asian-Americans, this would have a huge effect on the health awareness of this population.</p>
