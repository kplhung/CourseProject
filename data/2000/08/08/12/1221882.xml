        <p>In gauging the health of any industry, one of the most accurate methods is to follow the money. In horse racing that means following a buff, combed and yet-to-be-raced yearling into the Humphrey S. Finney Sales Pavilion. Then, listen to the auctioneer's sing-song pitch and keep an eye on the tote board. Sometimes the buyers themselves are surprised at the final flash of numbers.</p>
        <p>Or at least John C. Oxley was after the gavel banged on his winning bid of $1.25 million for a horse labeled Hip No. 13 at the Fasig-Tipton Saratoga yearling sale on opening night Tuesday.

        <p>In gauging the health of any industry, one of the most accurate methods is to follow the money. In horse racing that means following a buff, combed and yet-to-be-raced yearling into the Humphrey S. Finney Sales Pavilion. Then, listen to the auctioneer's sing-song pitch and keep an eye on the tote board. Sometimes the buyers themselves are surprised at the final flash of numbers.</p>
        <p>Or at least John C. Oxley was after the gavel banged on his winning bid of $1.25 million for a horse labeled Hip No. 13 at the Fasig-Tipton Saratoga yearling sale on opening night Tuesday. He had just paid a record price for a New York-bred, a Silver Deputy filly out of Screened, the multiple stakes producing Alydar mare.</p>
        <p>''The price was more than I anticipated, but when you find the right horses, you've got to go ahead and buy them,'' reasoned Oxley, an oil and gas exploration magnate who owns last year's champion mare, Beautiful Pleasure.</p>
        <p>In the past 12 months, buyers have been digging deeper for the right horses and in the process pushing prices to record levels. At last September's Keeneland yearling sale, buyers paid more than $233 million for 3,013 yearlings and boosted the average price for the seventh consecutive year. The  $77,357 average price was 30 percent more than the previous record. Last month at Keeneland's summer select yearling sale, the numbers were even more staggering.</p>
        <p>Over three sessions, revenues rose for the sixth consecutive year and grossed $82,120,000 to reach their highest level since 1990; the average price of a yearling increased to $621,015 from $581,932. And more records were set here: 137 yearlings were sold for $41,901,000, a 7.6 percent increase in revenue from the record $38,957,000 set last year; and the average price of a yearling was $305,847, up 15.8 percent from the record average set last year.</p>
        <p>''You don't know what the high end is anymore,'' said Eugene Melnyk, who paid $1.8 million for a sale-topping Hennessy filly this week. ''After the first two hours of an auction, it's pretty clear you have to pay 50 percent more than you intended.''</p>
        <p>Strangely, however, this spending spree has boosted the optimism of owners and racing officials in an industry that spent the first half of the 1990's recovering from the bust of its last boom market and the second half of the decade trying to position itself as an entertainment option in a crowded sports market.</p>
        <p>''I went broke in the 1980's and I can tell you that was crazy money,'' said Barry Irwin, who heads Team Valor, which syndicates horses among multiple partners and in the spring took the Santa Anita Derby winner, The Deputy, to the Kentucky Derby. ''That money was borrowed, leveraged and invested for tax purposes.''</p>
        <p>Wiser money or not, the strategy remains the same for horse traders. Buy low, sell high and become the next Fusao Sekiguchi.</p>
        <p>Sekiguchi is the Japanese entrepreneur who recently sold controlling interest in the Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus to Coolmore Stud. In 1998 he bought the colt for $4 million, won $1.89 million with him this year, and sold him at a reported value of $60 million to $70 million -- though it was unclear what his take was because 40 percent of the horse belongs to the Yoshida family of Japan.</p>
        <p>''It's the big home run everyone is after,'' Melnyk said. ''It pays for the rest of the fun.''</p>
        <p>Like most owners, Melnyk, 41, wants to swing for those fences. But he also is one of the newer breed of owners -- among them are Mike Pegram, who won the 1998 Kentucky Derby with Real Quiet, and Jim Scatuorchio, who races More Than Ready -- who came to horse ownership from the front side, or betting windows.</p>
        <p>Melnyk's interest as a horse player at age 14 evolved to his becoming an every weekend track attendee, to owning claiming horses in the 1980's and, last week, winning the Jim Dandy here with Graeme Hall just five years after plunging into the top-end horse market. He owns 138 horses, including stallions, brood mares and 36 2-year-olds that he hopes will make it to the Triple Crown races next year.</p>
        <p>With Churchill Downs Inc. and MI Entertainment Corp., founded by the industrialist Frank Stronach, rapidly acquiring racetracks, Melnyk believes he is betting wisely as an owner as well as an industry handicapper.</p>
        <p>Churchill Downs and MI Entertainment  each own six tracks, from Florida to California. ''We are in the early stages of consolidation, which means high-end tracks will offer more high-end races and purses,'' Melnyk said.</p>
        <p>In an industry known for its divisions between owners, racetrack operators and horseman, the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, now in its third year of existence as a quasi-league office, may finally be providing some focus. The organization has increased the hours of race coverage on network and cable television, delivered clever television commercials and fostered a spirit of cooperation.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday, for example, a Mystery Mutuel Voucher promotion boosted attendance at tracks across the country on a day of national stakes races headlined here by the Whitney. The N.T.R.A. mailed vouchers, redeemable at 32 tracks and off-track betting outlets, to more than one million people. One Voucher was worth $1 million, and tracks combined to offer $2.7 million in prizes. No one cashed the $1 million voucher, but an increase in attendance and handle was significant -- ranging from a 22 percent increase in attendance at Monmouth Park on Sunday, the day of the Haskell, to a 524 percent increase in attendance at Mountaineer Park in West Virginia.</p>
        <p>The economy is good right now, so the pursuit of fast horses can be costly. But owners like Melnyk and Irwin believe this competitive market is in good hands.</p>
        <p>''Now we have people in the game for the right reasons,'' Irwin said. ''To have fun and make money.''</p>
