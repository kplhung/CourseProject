        <p>When it comes to figuring out the dos and don'ts of running a convention, the Democrats seem to have picked up a few pointers from the Republicans.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 2, when the Republicans were paying tribute to their three living former presidents, Ford, Reagan and Bush, with brief videos, Vice President Al Gore was watching intently.</p>
        <p>Moved by the films, Mr. Gore called the sole living former Democratic president, Jimmy Carter, the next morning and invited him to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter, who has had strained relations with President Clinton and who spent the 1996 Democratic convention vacationing in Montana, had been wavering about attending next week's event. But when Mr. Gore called, he said yes. (An aide to Mr. Carter said the former president had a good relationship with Mr. Gore.)</p>
        <p>And so on Monday night, the Democrats, too, will pay video tribute to their last former president, while Mr. Carter looks on. (He will not address the convention, his aide said.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter's tribute is not the only way the Democrats have designed their convention to be like, or unlike, the Republican gala in Philadelphia last week.</p>
        <p>The Republicans ran a ''cotton candy convention'' without much discussion of specific issues, the Democrats say. So their convention will be loaded with policy discussions.</p>
        <p>Each night, they will hold carefully staged panels featuring people Mr. Gore has met during the campaign -- some of them just happen to be Democratic delegates -- talking about the big issues, like health care, crime and the economy.  ''The Gore campaign has been reacting to everything Governor Bush has done since the beginning of the campaign,'' said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate. ''It's not surprising they might be following our lead on the convention as well.''</p>
        <p>But in another marked contrast to the Republican program, Congressional Democrats will have prominent roles in their convention. In Philadelphia, the Republicans gave few prime-time speaking slots to their Congressional leaders, saying they were trying to leave the limelight to Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The Democrats contend the Bush campaign was trying to distance itself from an unpopular Republican Congressional majority. Not so with Mr. Gore and the Congressional Democrats, they say.</p>
        <p>''Are we trying to do things differently?'' said Jennifer Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. ''Absolutely. This makes an understated political point: Unlike the Republicans, everyone in our party is running on the same things.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bartlett replied, ''If they want to wheel out Washington-based politicians to display as their face at the convention, that's fine with us.''</p>
