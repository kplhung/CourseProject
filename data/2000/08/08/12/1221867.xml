        <p>For months now, Al Gore has been searching for the proper degree of separation from Bill Clinton. He has used measured words and occasional policy differences both to try to distance himself from the president and to demonstrate that he is his own man, worthy of the presidency in his own right.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he has hoped to benefit from his participation in an administration that has presided over the longest economic expansion in history.</p>
        <p>But in an ultimate twist, it seems that Mr. Gore may have to rely on the very man he is distancing himself from to make his case.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign is planning a multistage separation process over the next few days, although there are still internal debates over some details and how explicit Mr. Clinton should be in talking about his personal behavior and impeachment when he addresses the convention on Monday night.</p>
        <p>That process may have begun prematurely with Mr. Clinton's comments on Thursday, when he said in a lengthy public confessional that voters should not hold Mr. Gore accountable for Mr. Clinton's sins.</p>
        <p>''Surely, no fair-minded person would blame him for the mistakes I've made,'' Mr. Clinton said in an interview with a pastor in Illinois.</p>
        <p>Gore advisers have been frustrated over the months with some of Mr. Clinton's moves that were intended to be helpful but often upstaged Mr. Gore. But they said today that Mr. Clinton's most recent comments could help the vice president -- because they expected the light to shine brightly on Mr. Clinton at this point anyway.</p>
        <p>''We have known for the last four months that the first few days of the ramp-up into our convention was in large measure going to be about Bill Clinton and the last eight years,'' said a top Gore adviser. ''To do it any other way would be frankly ungracious and not politically smart.''</p>
        <p>But such is the entangled relationship between the president and vice president -- and such is the admiration for Mr. Clinton's political skills -- that questions were raised about whether the White House and the Gore campaign had actually planned Mr. Clinton's remarks as a way for Mr. Clinton to give Mr. Gore some breathing space, even if they dredged up the unpleasantness that led to the impeachment.</p>
        <p>Both camps said no. Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, said Mr. Clinton arranged the interview with his pastor and did not clear it with the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>The Gore adviser said the same thing. ''I have no idea whether Clinton's remarks were spontaneous or premeditated,'' he said. ''But they were not coordinated.''</p>
        <p>But much of the distancing dance that will take place in the next few days has been planned. Mr. Gore has given Mr. Clinton the starring prime-time role at the convention on Monday. Both sides are envisioning not only a celebration of Mr. Clinton's glory years but a clear signal that his problems are of his own making and should not be used against Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>One Democrat close to Mr. Clinton said the president might have used his confessional interview on Thursday as a kind of rehearsal for the convention speech. ''He's trying out the show in New Haven before he gets to Broadway,'' the Democrat said.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign said Mr. Clinton will not be so explicit at the convention, and White House officials agreed, adding that Mr. Clinton used the forum on Thursday as more of a pre-emptive cleansing so he would not have to do that at the convention. In any case, Gore advisers are focused on other things. ''Clinton has great job performance ratings and terrible personal ratings,'' one aide said. ''The whole trick here is to try to be associated with the job performance.''</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, a symbolic passing of the torch from Mr. Clinton to Mr. Gore has been arranged in Michigan.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Question has been swirling around the Gore candidacy for months, and Mr. Gore has dealt with it in various ways. He began his campaign in June 1999 with his strongest comments to date about Mr. Clinton's affair, but he seemed genuinely surprised along the campaign trail to be asked about the president. Finally, he figured out a fairly formulaic answer, which he has more or less followed for months.</p>
        <p>He told audiences that his relationship with Mr. Clinton consisted of four parts. As he put it in January to New Hampshire Public Radio: ''First of all, we're friends, and that friendship is genuine. Secondly, I have been critical of the personal mistake that the president made, which I've been asked about from time to time in this campaign. Third, I have fought alongside the president for this strong economy and for the other improvements that we've seen during the Clinton/Gore administration. And fourth, I have to win this race on my own.''</p>
        <p>''Now,'' he continued, ''depending upon the question that's asked or the perspective of the questioner, they may focus on one of those four aspects of the relationship and not really hear the complexity of it with all four, and if they hear only that I'm running on my own, they may say, 'Oh, he's distancing himself.' If they hear I fought with President Clinton for a strong economy, they may say, 'Oh, he's embracing President Clinton.' Well, all of those things are true, but it's not true that I'm either distancing myself from him or that I am trying to run as a derivative candidate. So it's a complex relationship, just as most human relationships are.''</p>
        <p>Gore advisers acknowledge that this is an important week for the Clinton/Gore relationship. And they acknowledge that Mr. Gore's selection of a running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who was the first Democratic senator to openly chastise Mr. Clinton for his behavior, was part of the larger process of trying to inoculate himself against Mr. Clinton's behavior.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Clinton, who arrived in Los Angeles today for Mr. Gore's nominating convention, is charting his own course in how a president ought to hand off the baton. He has already broken with the tradition of past presidents who arrived just as the conventions for their vice presidents were set to begin.</p>
        <p>At Los Angeles International Airport, a reporter shouted to Mr. Clinton that his vice president was concerned that the president was overshadowing him. Mr. Clinton tilted his head back, laughed and said: ''I've never heard him say that.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton is attending several galas in his honor, aides said the president would spend much of his time polishing his speech. Mr. Clinton intends to give a valedictory address that is shorter than former President Reagan's 53-minute speech in New Orleans but just as focused on making the case for 12 years of one-party rule. As is the custom, the White House has shared early drafts of the speech with Mr. Gore. White House officials have told the Gore campaign there will be no surprises.</p>
        <p>Reviewing the hubbub over the day and Mr. Clinton's comments, Gore advisers said all the media's roiling and roar over the Clinton-Gore relationship today was nothing new, at least for the Gore campaign. Said one, ''It's just another day at the office.''</p>
