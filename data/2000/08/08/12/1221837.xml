        <p>Forcefully asserting its view that Japan's economy is now growing firmly after years of false starts, the central bank raised interest rates today for the first time in a decade, defying strong pressure from government officials to keep borrowing costs close to zero.</p>
        <p>In what was described as a taxing all-day meeting, the Bank of Japan's nine-member board voted to abandon the zero-interest policy it had adopted in February 1999 as an emergency measure to keep the economy from slipping further into recession.</p>
        <p>While the move had been widely expected, it nonetheless sent a powerful message about the central bank's view that the Japanese economy, the world's second largest, has now achieved enough momentum to keep expanding. The move also represented an unparalleled display of independence by the central bank, which had been given more autonomy under a change in the law a few years ago but until today had never exercised it.</p>
        <p>The central bank said it would steer a benchmark rate known as the overnight call rate -- the interest rate banks charge each other -- to 0.25 percent from virtually zero.</p>
        <p>The official discount rate, which is the largely symbolic rate on loans the central bank charges to private banks, was left unchanged at 0.5 percent, a record low.</p>
        <p>Today was the first time since 1990 that the central bank had raised rates, which it had lowered repeatedly in response to Japan's seesaw pattern of recession and feeble recovery that characterized much of the decade.</p>
        <p>''At present, Japan's economy is showing clearer signs of recovery, and this gradual upturn, led mainly by business fixed investment, is likely to continue,'' the central bank said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The increase in the benchmark rate will lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Even so, the benchmark rate remains extraordinarily low in this country. The comparable rate in the United States is 6.5 percent and in Europe it is 4.25 percent.</p>
        <p>The announcement of the rate increase here came after the close of the financial markets. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks was up 141.85 points, or 0.89 percent, to 16,117.50. The yen was little changed against the dollar. The markets were not expected to react much when they reopened on Monday.</p>
        <p>But the central bank's decision drew sharp criticism from government officials, political leaders and many economists who have argued that Japan's economy is still too delicate to sustain an increase in interest rates, no matter how small. Many critics of the increase view it more as a statement of independence on the part of the central bank than as sound economic policy.</p>
        <p>''I think the Bank of Japan has probably moved too soon in light of the economic situation,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo. ''The onus is on them to demonstrate their decision was correct.''</p>
        <p>Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist for Commerz Securities in Tokyo, said the rate increase was ''a brave move but not necessarily one that the economy justifies.''</p>
        <p>While Japan's economy grew 2.5 percent in the first three months of 2000 and the government projects that economic growth this fiscal year will be 1 percent, double the rate of a year earlier, Mr. Bevacqua said that Japan's growth was peaking and would slow.</p>
        <p>The government, which early this week denounced any rate increase as premature, asked the central bank at its meeting today to postpone a decision on rates until next month, when second-quarter gross domestic product figures will be available to better assess the country's economic performance.</p>
        <p>But the board immediately rejected the request by a majority vote, the central bank said.</p>
        <p>At a news conference after the meeting, Masaru Hayami, the central bank's governor, stressed that the zero-rate policy had been an extraordinary measure meant to ward off deflation -- a dangerous downward spiral of prices and incomes that can lead to a full-scale depression. But Mr. Hayami said such a policy had to end at some point, and the deflation threat had passed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hayami has long stated the need to raise interest rates, arguing that the zero-rate policy essentially encourages nearly free borrowing that keeps unprofitable businesses from making painful cutbacks. It also hurts the incomes of Japan's growing population of retirees whose savings are barely earning interest.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Hayami had conducted a public relations campaign of sorts, proclaiming the necessity of raising rates. Many analysts said he had gone too far to turn back, and one central bank board member who attended today's meeting said that Mr. Hayami had convinced most board members that it was their duty to vote for the rate increase, as a measure not only of their independence but their legitimacy.</p>
        <p>''All economic data, ranging from corporate investment to jobs and spending have gotten better in August and July,'' Mr. Hayami said.  ''Board members took these data as proof that deflation fears have dissipated.''</p>
        <p>At its board meeting last month, the central bank had been widely expected to lift the zero-rate policy, but the collapse of a highly indebted retailer, the Sogo Company, sent shudders through the financial system and the bank decided to maintain the policy while it monitored the impact of Sogo's failure.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the immediate impact of the rate increase would probaly be tightening of credit available to small and medium-size businesses, which will increase bankruptcies and unemployment.</p>
        <p>Particularly vulnerable are the real estate, construction and retail sectors, which are the most heavily indebted. Higher interest rates will also make it more costly for the government to borrow money to feed the extensive spending projects that have helped keep Japan's economy from faltering even further over the last decade.</p>
        <p>The rate increase puts Japanese banks in a particularly difficult position. The banks, which have received enormous government aid because of hundreds of billions of dollars of unpaid loans on their books, have  promised that they would make more loans to small and medium-size businesses. But they will be hard pressed to keep those promises while raising their loan rates.</p>
        <p>Reaction to the rate increase was mixed in the Japanese business community. Takashi Imai, chairman of the Nippon Steel Corporation, told the Kyodo news service that he found it difficult to understand the central bank's decision. ''Given personal consumption and prices, it can hardly be said we have come to a point where we can be certain that concern for deflation is gone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of the Fuji Xerox Company, welcomed the rate increase, saying: ''The Japanese economy is now in a very good shape. The decision is confirmation that concerns about deflation are gone and that the economic recovery is getting on the right track.''</p>
