        <p>Leslie Macpherson fumbled with her tool belt as she walked into the room  crammed with wires. She had never seen so many in her life. Blue ones, white ones. Wires as thin as toothpicks, wires as thick as thumbs. Thousands of them.</p>
        <p>In her regular management job with Verizon Communications, the country's  largest local telephone company, Ms. Macpherson kept track of utilities regulations imposed by state agencies. She wore a suit and sat at a desk. She met with government officials. She wrote reports. She did not carry around pliers or orange telephone handsets.</p>
        <p>But that was before the union strike began last Sunday. Ms. Macpherson is  now temporarily a technician, and a technician must know her wires. In this Verizon office in Midtown Manhattan, the wires are housed in metal frames the size of a mobile home. After several  days on the job, Ms. Macpherson now knows how to lay a wire to help set up a dial tone for a new customer. A dial tone! The fundamental product created and sold by Verizon and its 260,000 employees.</p>
        <p>''I think that's fed from the switch,'' she said, waving toward a bundle of wires. ''I think.''</p>
        <p>''These are cables,'' she said, pointing to a thick gray sheath. ''They go  underground to the cosmic frame.''</p>
        <p>Cosmic frame?</p>
        <p>''Don't ask me about the cosmic frame,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Macpherson is one of about 30,000 managers who have been filling in for more than 86,000 unionized workers at Verizon offices from Maine to Virginia, pinch-hitting on union jobs that range from answering 411 calls to fixing aerial cables.</p>
        <p>And after several days of the work, many of them said that while they were not siding with the unions, they had a new appreciation for the work of its members.</p>
        <p>''I have a great deal of respect for the people who do it, having done it myself,'' said Diana Barnes, who was transferred from the department that places advertising for Verizon to work as a directory assistance operator. ''So some good comes out of bad, if management appreciates the workers more.''</p>
        <p>Both Ms. Macpherson and Ms. Barnes were sent from Verizon's New York headquarters to work at the company's largest directory assistance center in the city, on 38th Street between Second and Third Avenues in Manhattan. An informal, school's-out atmosphere had descended on the place. Offices usually bustling with a dozen people were staffed by one or two managers. Fill-in workers sauntered in wearing jeans and sneakers. Supervisors who usually sat at desks ran around the hallways with tools, doing double duty as bosses and the bossed.</p>
        <p>Of course, union workers have been less than thrilled with managers filling their jobs. They are represented by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The police have received reports of egg throwing and vandalism. On a recent afternoon, several people in a picket line outside the 38th Street building yelled at a woman walking in through the front doors.</p>
        <p>''No, don't go in there,'' shouted Arthur Treisman, a telephone operator waving a union placard. ''Don't go in there! Scab!''</p>
        <p>Miguel Garrido, a technician picketing alongside Mr. Treisman, said he felt insulted that managers were working union jobs.</p>
        <p>''I think none of them are qualified to do what we do,'' Mr. Garrido said. ''Most of them were educated in college, but they're not technically inclined.''</p>
        <p>While union shifts are usually eight hours, most managers have been working 12-hour days to compensate for the short staff. After 13 days, if the strike lasts that long, they are to get a one-day break.</p>
        <p>''Realistically, the work out of this office is tremendous, and we do the best we can with what we have,'' said Deborah Torruellas, who supervised Ms. Macpherson and other frame technicians. ''Over the long term, one would see a negative change, because the people here are working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and it just won't do.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Torruellas has been with the company for 22 years, working her way up through half a dozen departments to become a manager. When her 38 frame technicians went on strike, she was forced to train eight managers from other parts of the company to do their jobs. The new recruits had to learn in hours what it sometimes took months to master, she said.</p>
        <p>The strike has also meant that Ms. Torruellas had to strap on a tool belt and work on the frames herself, something she had not done regularly for a decade. ''At least I'm off my desk and on the floor,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Most of the jobs that needed filling were operator positions. Three floors above Ms. Torruellas, about 30 people sat in gray cubicles wearing headsets. The calls for directory assistance came in one after another, an endless stream of questions.</p>
        <p>Robert Shapiro was trying to type the word ''coronet'' into his computer. A caller wanted the number of the movie theater by that name. Mr. Shapiro tapped out the letters slowly.</p>
        <p>''Spell it for me,'' he told his caller. ''I'm a manager here. I don't have typing skills.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shapiro usually manages computer programmers developing Verizon's e-commerce systems in a White Plains office. But on this day he wore the shackles of the old economy. In his operator's cubicle he would sit for 12 hours, with only three breaks -- 30 minutes for lunch and two 15-minute periods. He had taken his shoes off. On his desk sat an apple, a cookie and a bottle of water.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shapiro, who also worked as an operator during the last strike, which lasted for two days in 1998, has been averaging 900 calls in a 12-hour shift. (A trained directory assistance operator takes more than 1,000 calls in an eight-hour shift.) During a recent five-minute period, callers asked Mr. Shapiro for the numbers of a pizzeria, a doughnut shop, a pharmacy, the United Parcel Service and a jeweler in Manhattan named Gumuchjian Fils.</p>
        <p>''It really gives you an appreciation of the work that the union folks do,'' he said. ''It's invaluable.''</p>
        <p>Three floors below, Ms. Macpherson pulled out her pliers and stared at the wires snaking over the metal girders. So many wires! During the last strike, at least, she had been able to hit the road for two days as a delivery driver. But it could be worse, she said, shaking her head as she thought about the managers who had to work as operators.</p>
        <p>''I'm O.K. with this,'' she said. ''I'm not complaining.''</p>
