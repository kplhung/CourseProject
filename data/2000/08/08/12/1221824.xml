        <p>Gov. George W. Bush called on Vice President Al Gore today to emphatically state his disapproval of President Clinton's sexual conduct in office and to send Americans a clear message that he would maintain a high level of integrity if elected to the presidency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who has pledged ''to restore honor and dignity'' to the White House, conceded that Mr. Gore could accomplish the same task. But he said that Mr. Gore first needed to signal his intent to do so and to acknowledge that Mr. Clinton had done the country damage.</p>
        <p>''If he's got a problem with what went on in the past, he ought to explain what it is,'' Mr. Bush said aboard his campaign plane as he flew here from Sacramento during a four-day campaign swing through states on the West Coast.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also said that if Mr. Gore was determined to govern with a set of scruples different from Mr. Clinton's, ''he ought to say so.''</p>
        <p>Those comments were clearly related to Mr. Clinton's affair with a White House intern, a subject that reporters had broached. But a few more strongly worded remarks that had come just a bit earlier in the conversation with reporters on his campaign plane this morning also seemed implicitly to acknowledge the affair.</p>
        <p>''If Al Gore has got differences with the president, he ought to say them loud and clear,'' Mr. Bush said, referring in part to a published interview in which Mr. Gore stated that he wanted to give the country ''a fresh start.'' ''He ought to let us know where he differed from the president, on policy matters as well as everything else.''</p>
        <p>The 10-minute conversation, which came on the heels of an appeal by Mr. Clinton on Thursday that voters not let whatever misdeeds he committed affect their judgments about Mr. Gore, was noteworthy for several reasons. In saying that Mr. Gore was also capable of bringing a renewed dignity to the White House, Mr. Bush seemed to undercut a principal argument for his own candidacy.</p>
        <p>But the conversation also reflected and distilled Mr. Bush's continuing attempts to have it several ways in his campaign, especially when it comes to the topics of Mr. Clinton's affair and Mr. Gore's aspirations.</p>
        <p>On one hand, Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, insisted that this race was about the future, as he often has. ''This is a campaign that is going to be writing new chapters in the 21st century,'' he said. ''We're moving forward.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Bush once again summoned the specter of Mr. Clinton's past, which he clearly sees as a useful wedge against Mr. Gore, his Democratic rival.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's delicate and sometimes awkward attempt to straddle this contradiction was evident when he quibbled with reporters who noted that he and his advisers had frequently said he would ''restore honor'' to the Oval Office, a clear assertion that this virtue had been lost.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush countered today that his standard pledge, at the end of almost every stump speech, was not to restore but ''to uphold the honor and integrity'' of the presidency. He did not acknowledge the occasional use of the other, more loaded phrase or the fact that both he and his running mate, Dick Cheney, have at times in the last two weeks added the word ''decency'' to the list of qualities that the next occupant of the White House should possess.</p>
        <p>The semantic squabbling took an even odder turn when Senator John McCain of Arizona, who had stood beside Mr. Bush on the plane, introduced him at a subsequent rally here. Mr. McCain opened his remarks by saying that Mr. Bush would ''restore dignity, honor and respect to the White House.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has been doing his own balancing act, trying to associate himself with the prosperity of the Clinton era but not with Mr. Clinton's personal behavior. He rarely makes reference to Mr. Clinton's affair, but he has condemned the president's behavior on a few occasions, once branding it ''inexcusable.''</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said that Mr. Bush should talk about his plans, not Mr. Clinton's past, and was ''only offering Americans a rear-view-mirror vision for the country's future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who has vowed time and again to run a positive and upbeat campaign, said on his plane that he was simply noting an important reality. ''The president embarrassed the nation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And he said that American voters sought some reassurance that the next president understood that and wanted to fix it. ''Unfortunately, in this point in history, it's a pledge that those of us running for office must make and should keep,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>When one reporter noted to Mr. Bush that many Democrats, along with Republicans, had publicly blamed Mr. Clinton for dishonoring the presidency, Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for the Bush campaign, interjected, ''Joe Lieberman said that, and Al Gore did not.'' She was referring to Mr. Gore's running mate, the Connecticut senator.</p>
        <p>When another reporter asked Mr. Bush if Mr. Gore could be an agent of the reassurance that voters needed, Mr. Bush said: ''I think he can. He ought to say so.''</p>
