        <p>High oil prices and a debt-for-equity swap could restore the bankrupt Thai Petrochemical to profitability this year, its chief executive, Prachai Leophairatana, predicted. Thailand's bankruptcy court declared Thai Petrochemical insolvent in March after a two and a half year battle between Mr. Prachai and creditors. Court-appointed administrators are now drafting a restructuring plan that Mr. Prachai said would probably lead to lower debt payments for the company, Thailand's biggest delinquent debtor. Together with solid Asian demand for petroleum products, he said, lower payments could lead to a full-year profit.</p>
