        <p>Back on foreign yet familiar ground, Maurice Greene and Marion Jones continued doing what they have done for much of the last three seasons: winning and waving to the crowd. But the American stars' victories tonight at the Weltklasse, the world's most prestigious and lucrative one-day track and field meet, were hardly business as usual.</p>
        <p>Greene had not raced since straining his hamstring and ruining his chances for an Olympic sprint double during the 200-meter final at the United States track and field trials in Sacramento on July 23.</p>
        <p>What was supposed to be a race for the ages between Greene and Michael Johnson, the world record-holder in the 200, became an anticlimactic dud when both failed to finish the race because of injuries.</p>
        <p>''Even though it was my birthday, it was a very sad night,'' said Greene, who turned 26 on July 23.</p>
        <p>But while Johnson has yet to return to competition, Greene made it clear tonight that he is now healthy and still the favorite in the 100 at the Sydney Olympics next month. He handled a fine field with confidence and controlled power to win in a time of 9.94 seconds that was all the more impressive considering Greene was running into a slight headwind.</p>
        <p>''I'm baaaaack,'' sang Greene, who said that he felt no pain during the race. ''I wish I could have run a lot faster than I did. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to, but I believe I ran a very good race tonight. I feel a little sluggish from being off, but this is the start of coming off my injury and I plan on getting better each and every race from here on out.''</p>
        <p>Jones certainly plans to improve on tonight's sprint performance, as well. She has not lost a 100-meter race since 1997, but she came perilously close here. After false-starting, she got off to a sluggish start and then had to chase down her fellow American Inger Miller.</p>
        <p>Jones, a two-time world champion in the 100, would end up winning by one-hundredth of a second in 10.95 seconds, a time that was mediocre by her high standards and well off the 10.78 she ran last week in London.</p>
        <p>''After the false start, I had to sit in the blocks,'' Jones said. ''But I'm not going to make excuses. Inger ran a very good race and today was her chance. It doesn't get much worse than that for me. Technically, it was very poor.''</p>
        <p>Other star sprinters might have headed back to the hotel and spent the rest of the evening stewing, but Jones, whose ambition is to win five Olympic gold medals next month, still had another event. And so she walked off the track and onto the infield and proceeded to win the long jump, traditionally her weakest event, over the strongest field yet assembled this season. She won with a jump of 22 feet 7 inches on her fifth of six attempts.</p>
        <p>That was only less than a half-inch farther than Iva Prandzheva of Bulgaria could fly on this balmy summer evening in Switzerland. Jones's other victims included Fiona May of Italy, the former Olympic champion Heike Drechsler of Germany and the reigning world champion Niurka Montalvo of Spain.</p>
        <p>The only major Olympic threat missing from the meet was the Russian Tatiana Kotova, who won the long jump in the first three legs of the Golden League against relatively weak fields but was missing tonight because of minor injuries she sustained in a recent car accident.</p>
        <p>''For Marion to come out and beat this field is good for her confidence,'' said Jones's coach, Trevor Graham. ''The things I've been telling her about the long jump are finally sinking in. We had some problems with the takeoff, and the speed on the runway is not there yet like we want it.''</p>
        <p>Hicham el-Guerrouj of Morocco certainly looked ready tonight. The world's premier men's middle-distance runner recorded the third-fastest time in history in the 1,500, winning in 3 minutes 27.21 seconds. Noah Ngeny of Kenya, considered the only man with a reasonable chance of beating el-Guerrouj in Sydney, was second in a Kenyan national record of 3:28.12.</p>
        <p>Despite the relatively small margin of victory, el-Guerrouj was in control of this race down the stretch and now has run all three of the fastest times in the event, including the world record of 3:26.</p>
        <p>Gabriela Szabo, the diminutive Romanian with the daunting kick, was also back in fine form after a rare loss last week in a 1,500-meter race in London. Her winning time in the women's 3,000, a non-Olympic distance, was the best of the year: 8:26.35 seconds.</p>
        <p>Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland was second in 8:27.58. Regina Jacobs, who won both the 5,000 and 1,500 at the Olympic trials, finished 14th in 8:50.12, which should make it easier for the American to decide which race to run in Sydney (the 1,500 would now seem the logical option).</p>
        <p>Other winners included the American champion Angelo Taylor in the men's 400 hurdles, the American record-holder Gail Devers in the women's 100 hurdles in a meet record of 12.39 seconds and Danny Ecker of Germany in the men's pole vault with a leap of 19 feet 2 inches. Sergei Bubka, the world record-holder and six-time world champion who is attempting to make one more run at an Olympic gold medal at age 36, cleared 18 feet but failed three times at 18-7.</p>
        <p>Haile Gebrselassie, the remarkable Ethiopian distance runner, did not fail in what could have been his final major race at 5,000 meters. But he did not dominate either, barely holding off a late charge by Kenya's Paul Tergat to win in 12:57.95. Gebrselassie is unbeaten outdoors since 1996 and is the world record-holder in the 5,000 and 10,000, but he plans to run only the 10,000 in Sydney before switching to the marathon and half-marathon. Tonight's race was his last before the Games.</p>
        <p>''It's getting harder and harder to win, but it's normal for an older runner,'' Gebrselassie said.</p>
