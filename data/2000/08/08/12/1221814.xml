      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center has shrunk in time in recent years, it has expanded in scope, offering a greater variety of events, not all of them having much to do with Mozart. The three Mozart songs in the recital by the German bass-baritone Thomas Quasthoff on Thursday evening at Alice Tully Hall, for example, served mainly as interlude.</p>
        <p>Not that anything was lacking in the presentation. Mr. Quasthoff was especially delightful in conveying Mozart's frisky eroticism in ''Warnung,'' a warning to fathers to keep their young daughters, their ''sugar candies,'' out of harm's way. And the straightforward playing of Mr. Quasthoff's partner, Justus Zeyen, a German pianist, caught the moods well enough. But the main events lay on either side: Schumann's glorious song cycle ''Dichterliebe'' (''Poet's Love''), to texts of Heine, and six songs from Mahler's ''Des Knaben Wunderhorn'' (''From the Youth's Magic Horn''), to folk texts.</p>

        <p>As the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center has shrunk in time in recent years, it has expanded in scope, offering a greater variety of events, not all of them having much to do with Mozart. The three Mozart songs in the recital by the German bass-baritone Thomas Quasthoff on Thursday evening at Alice Tully Hall, for example, served mainly as interlude.</p>
        <p>Not that anything was lacking in the presentation. Mr. Quasthoff was especially delightful in conveying Mozart's frisky eroticism in ''Warnung,'' a warning to fathers to keep their young daughters, their ''sugar candies,'' out of harm's way. And the straightforward playing of Mr. Quasthoff's partner, Justus Zeyen, a German pianist, caught the moods well enough. But the main events lay on either side: Schumann's glorious song cycle ''Dichterliebe'' (''Poet's Love''), to texts of Heine, and six songs from Mahler's ''Des Knaben Wunderhorn'' (''From the Youth's Magic Horn''), to folk texts.</p>
        <p>In a 1998 performance with the New York Philharmonic and, even more, in a recent recording with the Berlin Philharmonic on Deutsche Grammophon, Mr. Quasthoff has proved himself a master of the Mahler. He shows a consistent flair for the folkish, especially apt in the comic numbers, and supplies frank honesty and solidity in the outpourings of basic emotion.</p>
        <p>Yet the performance here was slightly disappointing. No matter that the piano versions of these works came before the orchestrations; a listener wants the pianist to evoke if not the magic of Mahler's instrumentation, then a magic of his own. Mr. Zeyen found little.</p>
        <p>Nor was Mr. Quasthoff invariably in his best voice; a slight insecurity and unevenness, for example, afflicted the high pianissimos of ''Rheinlegendchen.'' In general, he sounded weary -- for a reason, the audience learned later.</p>
        <p>But such niggling is only to hold Mr. Quasthoff to his own high standard, and even at less than his best, he made much of this music by dint of his big personality, his obvious intelligence and his exquisite sensitivity. In addition, he offered a substantial bonus, singing ''Urlicht,'' which is usually handled by a mezzo-soprano or alto, if one is around, as in the Second Symphony.</p>
        <p>The Schumann performance showed some of the same assets and defects. Although Mr. Quasthoff's basic sound is not the most flexible or colorful, he traced a wide variety of moods. And he located the central climax of the work precisely in ''Ich Grolle Nicht'' (''I Bear No Grudge''), though here his high fortissimo threatened to spin out of control. Mr. Zeyen's work was again merely functional where reverie and mystery were needed.</p>
        <p>The enthusiastic audience seemed disinclined to dwell on such faults, and Mr. Quasthoff returned to Schumann in an encore, sweeping grandly and triumphantly through ''Widmung'' (''Dedication''). For a second encore, he dispensed with a score and gave a wildly, jazzily modulated account of the spiritual ''Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,'' ranging from what must have been one of his highest notes to what was surely his lowest. The quality Mr. Quasthoff's singing everywhere possesses in abundance is soul: here it showed in more ways than one.</p>
        <p>Only now, apologizing to the avid audience for not adding a third encore, did Mr. Quasthoff explain the problems he had been having: he had been hospitalized for an intestinal condition four days before, he said, and in severe pain until the day before. With weariness evidently the least of his problems, the success he managed to achieve under the circumstances seemed all the more remarkable.</p>
