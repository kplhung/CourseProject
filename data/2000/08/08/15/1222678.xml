        <p>The great Indian sarod player Ali Akbar Khan performed with his 18-year-old son, Alam Khan, at his concert at Damrosch Park as part of the Lincoln Center Out of Doors Festival. Mr. Khan the son, sure and agile on the sarod, started giving public performances two years ago; Mr. Khan the father gave him what seemed like an extended lesson in Sunday night's concert.</p>
        <p>The 75-minute evening raga, ''Phari Jhinjhoti,'' which made up the bulk of the concert, opened up into improvisatory figures played by Mr. Khan to be followed by his son; at a nod from Mr. Khan, the two would play the long melody in unison and then go back to improvising. The fascination of the concert were the differences in tone and rhythm between an imperious, idiosyncratic old master and a young, earnest aspirant working his hardest to play Indian classical music correctly.</p>

        <p>The great Indian sarod player Ali Akbar Khan performed with his 18-year-old son, Alam Khan, at his concert at Damrosch Park as part of the Lincoln Center Out of Doors Festival. Mr. Khan the son, sure and agile on the sarod, started giving public performances two years ago; Mr. Khan the father gave him what seemed like an extended lesson in Sunday night's concert.</p>
        <p>The 75-minute evening raga, ''Phari Jhinjhoti,'' which made up the bulk of the concert, opened up into improvisatory figures played by Mr. Khan to be followed by his son; at a nod from Mr. Khan, the two would play the long melody in unison and then go back to improvising. The fascination of the concert were the differences in tone and rhythm between an imperious, idiosyncratic old master and a young, earnest aspirant working his hardest to play Indian classical music correctly.</p>
        <p>Ali Khan, who is in his late 70's, has a touch that brings out the banjolike quality of the sarod, an unfretted 25-string lutelike instrument with some strings for melodies, some strings for droning. It has a sheepskin head and a metal-plated neck, and in his hands the instrument tells you what it's made of: his picking hand is heavy, and his notes explode with a knocking, thumping and ringing. In the faster sections after the slow, stately opening alap (the introductory, unmetered part of a raga), he tended to strike notes late, creating friction against the pulse maintained by the tablaist Swapan Chaudhuri.  (Mr. Chaudhuri had one astonishingly fast solo in the middle of the raga, his fingers beating the tabla heads like hummingbirds.)</p>
        <p>And Mr. Khan ended some of his long musical statements mercurially, with a stray, sighing note uncoiling through wild slurring that seemed not to lead the ear back to the tonic, but pricked the listener into concentration because of their piquancy and oddity.</p>
        <p>His son often sounded as if he were playing a completely different instrument: his notes were pearly, liquid and precise, and at the end of certain phrases he curled a note upward in an inflection of formal elegance.</p>
        <p>As the performance picked up speed, the father gave the son long successions of phrases to follow note for note; sometimes the younger Mr. Khan replicated them an octave higher or lower. Toward the end, Ali Khan played particularly confounding rhythms to throw his son off -- not fast, but irregularly laid over the beat -- and, to be helpful, counted throughout by slapping his palm on the ground. The crowd laughed at the impossibility of it, and Alam Khan smiled when he couldn't quite execute the desired pattern.</p>
