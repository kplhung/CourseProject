        <p>Scientists have prodded bone marrow cells to turn into nerve cells, raising the tantalizing possibility of an easily accessible source of replacement cells to treat brain and nerve injuries and diseases.</p>
        <p>But the work is just beginning, experts say, and it remains to be seen whether the newly created nerve cells can correct spinal cord injuries or brain diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, even in animals.</p>
        <p>The research is described in the current issue of the Journal of Neuroscience Research. The lead author of the article, Dr. Ira Black, who is a professor and the chairman of the neuroscience and cell biology department at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, N.J., said he began the research with the thought of studying how the body's cells, each of which has the same set of genes, determine whether they would become blood cells,  brain cells, liver cells and so on.</p>
        <p>Like many other researchers, he wondered what signaled a cell to become one type or another. And he wanted to know how easy it was to redirect cells to develop into the type needed. The research is a new field  with potentially revolutionary implications, including the possibility of correcting even the most intractable health problems with cell replacements.</p>
        <p>''The exciting thing is the idea that the adult body has cells in it that can divide and differentiate and can potentially be used for cellular replacement,'' said Dr. Fred Gage, a neurobiologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego.</p>
        <p>In Dr. Black's study, the investigators removed cells from the bone marrow of rats -- and of humans -- that normally would develop into tendon, cartilage, bone, muscle and fat, and grew them in the laboratory in shallow dishes.</p>
        <p>Then they added an antioxidant, beta mercaptoethanol, which, Dr. Black had discovered in his previous work, seemed to be a sort of biological double negative. It appeared to block chemicals that prevented cells from becoming nerve cells.</p>
        <p>''Over the course literally of minutes, the cells converted from rather pedestrian, flat, undistinguished stem cells into absolutely typical neuron-looking cells,'' Dr. Black said, explaining that they looked like bright spheres surrounded by halos. Then the cells began growing long fibrous extensions, just like nerve cells. ''We were disbelieving,'' Dr. Black said.</p>
        <p>As the cells continued to change their type, they matured into cells that appeared, by all the chemical tests that Dr. Black applied, to be nerve cells.</p>
        <p>By tinkering with the chemical signals he used to stimulate the conversion, Dr. Black and his colleagues were able to turn 80 percent of the bone marrow cells into nerve cells. He said he transplanted the rat nerve cells to the brains and spinal cords of rats and found that they survived, for months so far.</p>
        <p>Other neurobiolgists said they were impressed.</p>
        <p>''It's really beautiful,'' said Dr. William Greenough, a neuroscientist at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology of the University of Illinois. While many researchers are working with tissue from embryos or with animal cells to develop replacement cells for the human body, and others are trying to redirect mature cells from other body organs to become replacement cells, Dr. Black's approach has some potential advantages: bone marrow cells are easy to obtain, and they could theoretically be obtained from the very patient to be treated, eliminating the problem of adding foreign tissue that the immune system might attack. ''I see this as a truly significant step along the way toward developing new technologies for the repair of the damaged brain,'' Dr. Greenough said.</p>
        <p>But experts emphasized the huge amount of work that needs to be done. Dr. Evan Y. Snyder, a neurobiologist at Harvard Medical School, said it remained to be seen whether cells that looked and acted like nerve cells when they were grown in a dish in a laboratory would look and act like nerve cells when they were transplanted into the body. ''The level of proof is going to be incredibly high,'' Dr. Snyder said.</p>
        <p>Dr. J. William Langston, who is president of The Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale, Calif., said that while he was excited by the possibility of creating brain cells from bone marrow, he wondered if the new cells would be specific enough to treat a disease like Parkinson's. With that disease, Dr. Langston said, patients need not only nerve cells but brain cells that will make the nerve chemical dopamine. They also need cells that will remain brain cells and not revert to fat cells or bone cells, he added. And, he said, it is important that the transplanted cells not overproduce dopamine. ''If those cells make too much dopamine, you could throw the patient into overdrive,'' he said. ''How do you make sure that they make the right amount?''</p>
        <p>At this point, Dr. Greenough said, ''the important thing to realize is that going from basic science to effective clinical treatment is a pathway that invariably has many steps.''</p>
        <p>''This is a really big step along this pathway,'' he added, but there is still a long way to go.</p>
