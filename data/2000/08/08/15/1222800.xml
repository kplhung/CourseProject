        <p>An argument in traffic at the foot of the Empire State Building led a man to open fire on a sport utility vehicle yesterday, the police and witnesses said. The gunman and his three companions then fled to the 14th floor of the building, where they were arrested, the police said. No one was hurt.</p>
        <p>At 3:49 p.m., a U-Haul truck with four passengers blocked traffic on 33rd Street while trying to back into the building's loading dock, according to Patrick Chow, a freight deliveryman from Kearny, N.J., who was parked there. The argument broke out when the driver of a blue sport utility vehicle blocked by the truck leaned on his horn.</p>
        <p>''One of the guys from the U-Haul got frustrated and started shooting,'' Mr. Chow said.</p>
        <p>He fired four times, the police said, hitting the S.U.V. Then the U-Haul occupants fled.</p>
        <p>A security guard on the loading dock knew the men were moving things for a business on the 14th floor and directed the police there, said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Empire State Building.</p>
        <p>Sightseers going to the observatory on the 86th floor of the building -- the site of a 1997 shooting that left two dead and six wounded -- pass through a metal detector, but people going to offices do not.</p>
        <p>Employees of businesses on that floor said their usually quiet hallways were filled with yelling and cursing. ''One of our girls heard the shooting downstairs,'' said an executive at Dearfoam Slippers who would not give his name.</p>
        <p>Soon after, the halls were filled with police officers. After the commotion, the man said, he could see two men in handcuffs lying face down on the floor outside the men's room, where the police said they had found the gun.</p>
        <p>The executive said he did not know the name of the business that was moving, or if the men were employees of the building or contractors. ''They can't be too bright if they work on this floor and they came running up here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The police said they apprehended three of the men and the security guards stopped the fourth. The recovered gun was a .25-caliber semiautomatic pistol, the police said.</p>
        <p>The four men were arrested but had not been charged as of late last night. They are Prince Nelson, 20, of 71 Elderts Street in Brooklyn; Kevin Williams, 22, of 794 Madison Street, Brooklyn; Robert Birch, 26, of 1895 Second Avenue in Manhattan; and Adam Jones, 26, of 20 Richmond Plaza, Brooklyn. A police spokesman said he did not know which was believed to have been the gunman.</p>
        <p>Raquel Lucas of Brooklyn, who works for the Newspaper National Network, watched the action from the window of her seventh-floor office at 20 West 33rd Street.</p>
        <p>''Someone was honking really loud, words were exchanged, then you heard the gunshots,'' she said. ''People don't have a lot of patience on this block.''</p>
