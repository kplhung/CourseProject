        <p>In the waning days of the cold war, one of the main disputes on national security between Republicans and Democrats involved missile defense.</p>
        <p>President Ronald Reagan dreamed of protecting the United States with an impenetrable missile shield -- a Strategic Defense Initiative -- that, as he said in his second Inaugural Address, ''would render nuclear weapons obsolete.''</p>
        <p>Democrats derided this ''Star Wars'' plan as technologically infeasible and preposterously expensive.</p>
        <p>Then the Soviet Union fell, other national security matters like Iraq and Bosnia moved to the forefront politically and the missile defense question faded. It was hardly mentioned in the 1992 and 1996 elections.</p>
        <p>Now the issue is back, in full force.</p>
        <p>The Republican platform adopted in Philadelphia this month and the Democratic platform to be approved in Los Angeles this week advocate construction of a missile system. But beyond the superficial political statement that they are in favor of it, the  parties embrace different systems.</p>
        <p>The Republicans want ''robust missile defenses'' to be deployed ''based on an evaluation of the best available options at the earliest possible date.'' The administration, the platform states, ''has become hopelessly entangled in its commitment to an obsolete treaty signed in 1972.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats accuse the Republicans of favoring ''an unproven, expensive and ill-conceived missile defense system that would plunge us into a new arms race.'' They call for a ''limited national missile defense system'' that would be ''compatible with the Antiballistic Missile Treaty'' of 1972.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has made clear that he supports a defensive system that would be based on land, at sea and possibly in space to cover all 50 states and be extended to protect allies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, adopting the Clinton policy, supports a more modest land-based system that could protect against a small number of missiles fired at the United States by mistake or by what the administration previously called rogue states but now calls ''states of concern,'' like, perhaps, North Korea or Iraq.</p>
        <p>This system should be built, in the Clinton-Gore view, only if it can be shown to enhance national security and if the cost and the technology are feasible. Governor Bush calls this approach timid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who as vice president has been instrumental in setting the administration's policy toward Russia, has expressed concern that any missile system would violate the 1972 treaty and undermine relations with Russia. The Democratic platform's insistence that the defense system be compatible with the treaty was seen by some as a guarantee that no such system would ever be constructed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said he has no qualms about pulling out of the pact.</p>
        <p>The candidates' positions are firmly grounded and went unchanged despite recent technological developments and intelligence estimates.</p>
        <p>Last month, the Pentagon conducted a test over the Pacific Ocean to show that an incoming missile could be shot out of the air. The $100 million test failed, the second one to fail this year, meaning that the Pentagon has yet to prove that even a basic missile defense is practical.</p>
        <p>Then last week, a highly classified report was sent to Congress warning that deployment of an American national missile defense could prompt China to expand its nuclear arsenal tenfold and lead Russia to place multiple warheads on ballistic missiles that now carry only one.</p>
        <p>One reason the candidates' positions in favor of missile defense may not be shaken by such developments is that they seem to be based as much on domestic political calculations as strategic concerns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush clearly understands how President Reagan's dream captured the public imagination. This spring, years after the Reagan plan was abandoned, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 58 percent of American adults favored building a shield against nuclear attack.</p>
        <p>As his campaign developed this year, Mr. Bush made a concerted drive to speak out on national security to allay concerns about his lack of experience in foreign policy matters.</p>
        <p>President Clinton developed his plan for a limited defense system in his 1996 re-election campaign. He wanted to dispel any notion that Democrats were soft on defense.</p>
