        <p>Astronomers have signed an agreement to build a radio telescope that would, in effect, be 100 times as large as today's largest.</p>
        <p>The plans were announced on Aug. 2 by scientists from 10 countries at the International Astronomical Union General Assembly in Britain. They said they hoped to come up with a design and location for the telescope by 2005 and to finish construction by 2015.</p>
        <p>The installation will most likely consist of 10 individual radio telescopes spread over thousands of miles but connected by computers and high-speed  links. The resulting system, called the Square Kilometer Array, because it will have a collecting area measuring one square kilometer, or the equivalent of nine football fields, would act as one enormous telescope.</p>
        <p>The idea for the installation sprang from astronomers' desire to study faint emissions from hydrogen gas structures formed soon after the Big Bang, the theorized explosion that gave birth to the universe. The scientists said they hoped it would help answer the most fundamental questions about the universe, including the way it took shape and its fate.</p>
        <p>Radio telescopes have a big advantage over optical telescopes because they can pick up radio waves despite cosmic dust, which sometimes obscures light from galaxies and regions where stars are forming.</p>
        <p>''Many of the radio telescopes in use today were designed in the 60's and 70's before today's technological advances,'' said Dr. Seth Shostak of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, a privately financed effort to detect evidence of life elsewhere in the universe, one of the groups that will use the telescope.</p>
