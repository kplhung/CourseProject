      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial scores Japan for permitting hunting of endangered sperm and Bryde whales, which are under protection of 1986 moratorium that Japan itself signed; says whale meat is not a staple in Japan, only a luxury food, and Japanese can make a small culinary sacrifice to preserve these majestic animals</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Over the years, Japanese whalers have killed thousands of whales in the name of scientific research. But this has merely been a cover for commercial whaling aimed at satisfying Japanese eating habits, in defiance of a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling that Japan itself signed.</p>
        <p>Japan is now using the same argument to justify its latest whale hunt, involving six whaling ships that are in the Northwestern Pacific to hunt minke, Bryde's and sperm whales. The hunt has stirred outrage among other signatories to the treaty. In recent days the State Department has threatened to block Japanese imports under an American law authorizing penalties against any nation that violates a marine conservation treaty.</p>

        <p>Japan is now using the same argument to justify its latest whale hunt, involving six whaling ships that are in the Northwestern Pacific to hunt minke, Bryde's and sperm whales. The hunt has stirred outrage among other signatories to the treaty. In recent days the State Department has threatened to block Japanese imports under an American law authorizing penalties against any nation that violates a marine conservation treaty.</p>
        <p>This will be the first time in 13 years that the Japanese have hunted sperm and Bryde's whales.  Though minke whales are relatively plentiful, sperm and Bryde's whales were nearly wiped out in the 1980's, before they came under the protection of the moratorium. Japan's actions pose a major threat to their survival. The United States is justified in invoking the so-called Pelly Amendment, which authorizes trade sanctions. The rest of the international community should follow suit.</p>
        <p>Whale meat is not a staple in Japan, only a luxury food. The Japanese can make a small culinary sacrifice to preserve these majestic animals.</p>
