        <p>Andy Pettitte ambled into the clubhouse this afternoon and saw about a dozen of his teammates watching the movie ''American Pie.'' Pettitte glanced at the screen once and then retreated to his locker.</p>
        <p>Pettitte did not have the interest or the time to watch the movie because he was engrossed with his own preparation. Pettitte had to remind himself that he could win at the Ballpark in Arlington. Forget about being so close to home and about being in a place that has been tougher for him than any other in the American League. Just focus. Just pitch.</p>
        <p>That is what Pettitte did. Pettitte pitched precisely while Jorge Posada and Derek Jeter stroked two-run homers as the Yankees cruised to a 7-3 victory over the Texas Rangers. Pettitte did not allow a run until the eighth inning, and the Yankees stifled the listless Rangers for the ninth straight time, including the 1999 division series. What else is new? The Yankees have now won 38 of the last 49 regular-season and postseason games against Texas.</p>
        <p>''This hasn't been a great place for him to pitch, but I sense a great deal of confidence,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ''He's in a zone right now where he knows what to do.''</p>
        <p>After Pettitte started with an 0-3 record and a 16.05 earned run average here, he has won two straight starts in the last 51 weeks and chopped that E.R.A. to 9.33. Some of Pettitte's family members from Deer Park, Tex., which is about three hours away, did not attend one of his starts a few years ago because they were worried about jinxing him.</p>
        <p>But that should not be a concern anymore. Not after Pettitte won his fifth straight start in dominating fashion to boost his record to 14-6. With 48 games left, Pettitte, who missed three weeks in April, should make about nine more starts, so he has a chance to win 20 games for the second time in his career. Tonight Pettitte, who permitted three earned runs in seven-plus innings, was happy to simply win another game at the Ballpark as 26 relatives watched.</p>
        <p>''When I came here earlier in my career, I couldn't concentrate, to tell you the truth,'' Pettitte said. ''I didn't have a good idea about what I wanted to do. I happened to come in here in the last two years in a good groove, and I've been confident.''</p>
        <p>Jose Canseco picked up one of Paul O'Neill's 35-ounce bats before the game and caressed it the way a father would caress a new baby. He rubbed it, he swung it and he told O'Neill that he did not believe how solid the barrel was. O'Neill nodded, pointed to the thick, stained barrel and told Canseco, ''When you hit one just right, it sounds different.''</p>
        <p>Posada had that feeling in the first, bashing a two-run homer that looked and sounded different. It is 390 feet to the left-center-field gap and there are 15 rows of bleacher seats in the section behind the fence. Posada's homer zoomed over the bleacher section and caromed off a newspaper advertising sign that said ''Sports Day,'' and the Rangers said it traveled 424 feet.</p>
        <p>Matt Perisho has been the Texas version of the Yankees' David Cone, with a slightly shorter streak without a victory and with an inferior stature since he has 180 fewer career victories. The left-hander had not won in his last nine starts, a skein that stretched to June 17.</p>
        <p>But Perisho had another inauspicious start last night as he plunked Jeter to initiate the game and then fell behind Posada with a 3-1 count. Perisho threw a breaking ball that might as well have been set up on a tee. Posada whipped his bat through the zone and hammered his 22nd homer to give the Yankees a 2-0 bulge. Canseco and Scott Brosius poked run-scoring singles, and Jeter added a two-run homer as Perisho's streak reached 10.</p>
        <p>Despite the 93-degree heat, Pettitte worked quickly to record 13 outs on grounders and limit the Rangers to no hits in nine at-bats with runners on base through the first seven innings. Pettitte revealed one of his new strategies for pitching here: he asks his wife to keep his children and his nieces and nephews away from him before he starts so he can concentrate.</p>
        <p>It was a refreshing evening for Pettitte, who lost, 15-2, here on July 30, 1996, and by 10-0 on July 7, 1995. But Pettitte was superb tonight and provided enough excellent footage to make his own home movie of his continuing chase for 20 victories.</p>
        <p>''As a starting pitcher, that's what you shoot for,'' Pettitte said. ''I won it in my second year. It's almost like if I don't win 20, it's not a real solid year. When I won 16 and 14, they were almost like disaster years. I think I set some high expectations for myself.''</p>
        <p>Even at home.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>GABE KAPLER singled in the second to increase his hitting streak to 27 games, but never budged past first as BERNIE WILLIAMS made a gorgeous diving catch on RICKY LEDEE's shot to right-center. . . . ALLEN WATSON underwent an M.R.I. dye test on his left shoulder Monday and STUART HERSHON, the Yankees' team physician, recommended that the reliever have arthroscopic surgery. Pitcher RAMIRO MENDOZA (tendinitis in right shoulder) is expected to throw later this week. Second baseman CHUCK KNOBLAUCH (tendinitis in right elbow) threw lightly and took batting practice.</p>
