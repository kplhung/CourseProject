      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A picture on Thursday with the obituary of Eugene R. Black, an investment banker, government adviser and Off Broadway playwright, was published in error, and the article misstated the date of his death. The date was April 21, not April 24. The picture showed his father, also named Eugene R. Black, who died in 1992. A picture of the younger Mr. Black appears today, on Page B6.</p>
