        <p>Ashley Sims, 13, went for a sleep over at her best friend's home in Brooklyn on July 22. It was the last time her family saw her alive.</p>
        <p>Shortly before 3 a.m., a ferocious fire flashed through the five-floor brownstone where she was staying, at 27 Brevoort Place in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The Fire Department  sent 121 firefighters and 32 vehicles, the first ones arriving in three minutes, but it took more than an hour to bring the inferno under control.</p>
        <p>Ashley died in the fire; her friend's mother, Diane Carter, was severely burned over nearly half her body and remains hospitalized. Six other residents and 10 firefighters suffered minor injuries.</p>
        <p>Officials said a flammable fluid had been spread in the stairwell in an apparent arson, and the building's fire sprinklers did not work.</p>
        <p>But now critics are faulting city inspection procedures. The city had  known about the defective sprinklers for nearly 10 months before the fire.</p>
        <p>The violations were first reported by City Limits, a magazine on urban issues in New York City.</p>
        <p>The city tried repeatedly to get the sprinklers fixed, reinspecting the building and calling the landlord, who made promises he did not keep. In December, citing difficulty in gaining access to the building, the city gave up and formally closed the file.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, Carol Abrams, said the agency had changed its procedures because of the fire. ''There's no question that a tragedy occurred,'' she said. The owner of the building, Antonio Casanova, could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>But tenant leaders, safety advocates and the City Council say the city should have used emergency powers to force the landlord to repair the sprinklers immediately, or arranged for repairs by city crews or ordered the building closed.</p>
        <p>''It was completely preventable,'' Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, said of the fatality. ''The New York City code enforcement program is a shambles and has been for years'' because of budget cuts, he said. Poor and minority residents in neglected buildings, he said, ''end up paying the price.''</p>
        <p>Councilman Archie Spigner, chairman of the Housing and Buildings Committee, said: ''If these facts are true, certainly the Department of Housing Preservation and Development is derelict in its responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Although the Fire Department declined to comment, a spokesman for the Uniformed Firefighters Association, a union, was critical of the handling of the case. Its fire and safety officer, Thomas Manley, said the violation ''should have been corrected immediately, or they could have vacated the building.'' Referring to the inoperable sprinklers, he said, ''It puts everybody at risk, including the firefighters.''</p>
        <p>City inspectors visited 27 Brevoort Place on Oct. 1, 1999, and again Oct. 10, both times issuing violations for defective sprinklers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Abrams said that the department phoned the owner, Mr. Casanova, on Oct. 25, and he agreed to fix the sprinklers. An inspector returned Nov. 9 to check but could not get in the building. An inspection on Nov. 18 found the repairs had not been done.</p>
        <p>The agency phoned Mr. Casanova on Nov. 22, and ''once again he said he would do the repair,'' Ms. Abrams said. Again he failed to do so. The agency was ready to do the work itself but was unable to get into the building. Inspectors returned on Dec. 2 and 10, leaving written notices. ''Those were the last attempts in that case,'' Ms. Abrams said.</p>
        <p>The inspectors were not allowed to force their way into the building, but a court order to require the repairs could have been sought.</p>
        <p>The fire has prompted two procedural changes. The agency's acting commissioner, Jerilyn Perine, has ordered that fire hazard cases not be closed for lack of access and that they also be referred to the Fire Department.</p>
        <p>Because of the apparent arson, the police are investigating Ashley's death as a homicide. Neighbors and relatives recalled tensions between the landlord and tenants over rent and repairs and said that police went to the building several times in the days before the fire.</p>
        <p>Ashley's family and Diane Carter could not be reached for comment. But Beverly Carter, Ms. Carter's sister, said of the city's repeated leniency with the landlord, ''They gave him violations, and they didn't close the building, and that doesn't make any sense to me.''</p>
        <p>Kendra Carter, 13, Ashley's friend, escaped the flames by dropping from a third-floor window edge. ''I still have nightmares about the fire,'' she said. ''Sometimes I just don't sleep. I think about what Ashley and I would be doing if she were still here.''</p>
