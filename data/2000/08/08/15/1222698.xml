        <p>The Consumer Product Safety Commission said today that about 91,000 motorized recreational carts were being recalled for safety reasons and that people who had them should stop using them immediately.</p>
        <p>Popularly known as go-karts, the vehicles are dangerous because riders' long hair or loose clothing can become entangled in rotating parts behind the driver's seat despite guards meant to prevent such accidents, the agency said.</p>
        <p>The commission said the manufacturer, Manco Products of Fort Wayne, Ind., had received a report of one death -- that of a 13-year-old Idaho girl whose neck was broken when her hair caught in a drive chain -- and two serious head injuries.</p>
        <p>The one-  and two-seat carts being recalled are powered by gasoline engines and were sold under the Manco, Phoenix, Fox, Rattler and Coyote labels from January 1983 through July 2000 for $600 to $2,000, the agency said. It said Manco was providing free repair kits.</p>
        <p>The commission has placed information on identifying the dangerous carts by description and serial number on its Web site, www.cpsc.gov. Further information can be obtained from the company's Web site (www.mancoprod.com) or by calling the company at (800) 293-0795, the commission said.</p>
        <p>The commission said the manufacturer was cooperating, as it did in a 1996 recall after a death and serious injuries were linked to exposed rear axles.</p>
