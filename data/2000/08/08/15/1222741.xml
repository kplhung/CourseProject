        <p>The Knicks' summer-long pursuit of Boston's Danny Fortson is apparently over. Fortson was the centerpiece of a four-team deal yesterday that will send the bruising power forward to the Golden State Warriors, according to a Western Conference official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The Warriors will receive Fortson and Utah's Adam Keefe, while the Celtics will receive the Dallas point guard Robert Pack and a No. 1 draft pick from the Jazz in return. Utah will receive Golden State forward Donyell Marshall.</p>

        <p>The Knicks' summer-long pursuit of Boston's Danny Fortson is apparently over. Fortson was the centerpiece of a four-team deal yesterday that will send the bruising power forward to the Golden State Warriors, according to a Western Conference official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The Warriors will receive Fortson and Utah's Adam Keefe, while the Celtics will receive the Dallas point guard Robert Pack and a No. 1 draft pick from the Jazz in return. Utah will receive Golden State forward Donyell Marshall.</p>
        <p>The Mavericks may have ended up with the best bargain of all in the four-team swap. Dallas secured the rights to Utah point guard Howard Eisley, John Stockton's primary backup the last few seasons.</p>
        <p>The deal allowed Dallas to sign Eisley, a free agent, to a multiyear deal so the Mavericks did not risk eventually losing Eisley if he had signed for Dallas's $2.25 million exception.</p>
        <p>As of yesterday afternoon, salary-cap issues still had to be worked out to complete the trade. But the official said the deal was imminent.</p>
        <p>Fortson was set to sign with the Knicks for the club's $2.25 million exception if the deal fell through. The Knicks were hoping to procure the frontcourt services of Fortson for their rebounder-poor team. A multipurpose post player, he could have come off the bench and relieved Patrick Ewing or Larry Johnson. But the four-team deal kills that possibility.</p>
