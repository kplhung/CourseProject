        <p>De Beers Consolidated Mines, the South African giant of the global diamond industry, won control of a promising diamond company in Canada today, agreeing to its demands for a higher price after a seven-week takeover struggle.</p>
        <p>The De Beers purchase of Winspear Diamonds Inc. of Vancouver, British Columbia, is the first diamond property the company has bought in Canada. It reflects the company's effort to broaden its sources of supply away from the war zones of Africa. Winspear owns a potentially lucrative underwater diamond deposit at Snap Lake in the Northwest Territories.</p>
        <p>Winspear directors endorsed the sweetened De Beers offer of 5 Canadian dollars a share, or 305 million Canadian dollars ($205 million). Winspear's president and chief executive, Randy Turner, said the bid ''recognizes the value and potential of the Snap Lake diamond deposit.''</p>
        <p>Winspear's shares rose 18 percent to 4.93 Canadian dollars ($3.32) on the Toronto Stock Exchange after the agreement was announced.</p>
        <p>The first De Beers offer of 4.25 Canadian dollars a share, on June 26, was dismissed as hostile by Winspear management. The Canadian company also said its Snap Lake ore reserves were triple what had been claimed -- and worth at least 500 million Canadian dollars.</p>
        <p>In response, Richard Molyneaux, president of De Beers Canada Inc., noted that no reserve had actually been defined on the Snap Lake property, which is about 140 miles northeast of Yellowknife, and that reaching under the lake bed to mine the shallow deposit would be risky. But 10 days later, De Beers extended the expiration date on its bid and Winspear dropped two legal actions, opening the way to friendlier talks.</p>
        <p>Snap Lake would be the first underground diamond mine in Canada. Since De Beers has unmatched experience in this area, and some urgency about expanding in Canada, there had been some expectation that it would eventually buy Winspear.</p>
        <p>De Beers was a bystander in the late 1990's, as diamond mines were discovered in Canada, but it has become more active since Mr. Molyneaux, who has mine experience in South Africa, became head of the Canadian unit early this year. The company now markets 35 percent of production from the Ekati mine, also in the Northwest Territories.</p>
        <p>De Beers will inherit a legal battle with a minority partner in the Snap Lake property. Aber Resources, also of Vancouver, had 33 percent of the claim, but after it failed to maintain its share of expenses, according to Winspear, Aber's interest was reduced to 15 percent. Aber disputed the move, which is now in the courts.</p>
