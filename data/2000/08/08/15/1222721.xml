      <block class="full_text">
        <p>An Artist Honored By Man and Beast</p>
        <p>Malcolm the cat went to the party, too.</p>
        <p>''He's so social,'' said LISA DE KOONING, who lives with Malcolm. And if this were a story by and about cats, the third W -- the ''where'' -- would be Malcolm's lawn.</p>
        <p>On Friday there were 500 humans under tents on Malcolm's lawn, which is between Ms. de Kooning's house and the studio of her father, the late Abstract Expressionist painter WILLEM DE KOONING. Malcolm found himself an empty chair at Table No. 14, jumped up and looked around. This was while the people at Table No. 14 were talking about people things and eating their appetizers. Malcolm might have found the main course more interesting: grilled shrimp over corn salsa.</p>
        <p>But enough about Malcolm (who is a black cat with a splash of white around the face). The party celebrated an exhibition called ''Willem de Kooning: In Process,'' which opened at the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton over the weekend and is the first large-scale show of the artist's works there since his death in 1997 at 92. In the crowd were MORTIMER B. ZUCKERMAN, the co-publisher of The Daily News; the de Koonings' lawyer, JOHN L. EASTMAN, and his wife, JODIE; the dealer LARRY GAGOSIAN; the artists CHUCK CLOSE, JULIAN SCHNABEL and MIRIAM SHAPIRO; LORNE MICHAELS, the executive producer of ''Saturday Night Live''; MELVILLE STRAUS, the chairman of the Guild Hall board; and Ms. de Kooning and her husband, CHRISTIAN VILLENEUVE.</p>
        <p>There were reminiscences. The artist JAMES ROSENQUIST talked about boarding a flight to Florida and being seated next to a man in a three-piece suit who ordered whiskey -- lots of whiskey. ''I think I'm going to get fired,'' the man said. Mr. Rosenquist recalled that when he told the man he was a painter, he replied: '' 'I had a friend who was a painter. We jumped ship together in Holland in the 20's. You ever hear from him? Is he doing all right?' I said he's doing all right.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenquist also talked about a visit to Mr. de Kooning's studio. ''He was painting away, and he didn't like the painting,'' Mr. Rosenquist said. ''He took a knife and scraped it off.'' A dealer said: ''Ah, this is your new style. We are prepared to pay $40,000.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rosenquist said that Mr. de Kooning had turned down the money.</p>
        <p>''From that moment,'' Mr. Rosenquist said, ''I loved that guy.''</p>
        <p>A Return to Shea, Minus the Moptops</p>
        <p>The promoter SID BERNSTEIN says he is going to Shea Stadium today, not to see the Mets play the Colorado Rockies in a doubleheader, but to ''nostalgicate'' (his word). Mr. Bernstein, 82, is the type who makes up words when the ones in the dictionary do not do the job.</p>
        <p>''Nostalgicate'' seems to be a synonym for reminisce. What he will be reminiscing about is something that happened at Shea 35 years ago today: a performance -- the first in a stadium -- by four young musicians he calls ''the boys.'' The Beatles.</p>
        <p>''Next to the birth of my six children,'' said Mr. Bernstein, who arranged the appearance, ''this became the most important day of my life, or the most memorable day of my life, being at Shea with 55,000 Beatles fans and press from all over the world, 1,100 press people. I think it broke all the records.</p>
        <p>''As John Lennon said to me a couple of years later, 'Sid, at Shea Stadium, I saw the top of the mountain.' I said, 'John, so did I.' ''</p>
        <p>But hear the words to the songs? Not that day. ''The sound people, I thought I had the best in New York,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''But we could not lick the problem of the sound. We couldn't hear the lyrics above the screaming. But I don't care. I was there. You could hear the instruments somewhat, if I'm recalling it accurately.''</p>
        <p>Something else that he recalls: the scene in the first-aid room. ''There were about 12 to 15 kids who had fainted from excitement,'' he said. In the first aid room, where the concertgoers were lying on stretchers, ''one of the doctors recognized me and said, 'There's Sid Bernstein.' Every one of the kids on those stretchers jumped up and said, 'Did you shake their hands? Did you wash your hands after you shook theirs? Oh, please, shake my hand.' ''</p>
