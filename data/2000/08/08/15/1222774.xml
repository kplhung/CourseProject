        <p>The Democratic convention program was running behind by 20 minutes tonight, which happened to be just long enough to ensure that Hillary Rodham Clinton's speech to the delegates was broadcast live in prime time on all three of the major broadcast networks.</p>
        <p>NBC News was not even scheduled to carry Mrs. Clinton's speech, having planned to go on the air at 10:30 p.m. Eastern time to pick up the first words of President Clinton's address a few minutes later. But because the first lady did not begin speaking until 10:24 p.m., NBC joined CBS and ABC in running most of the 18-minute talk.</p>
        <p>The Democratic coup did not go unnoticed by the NBC anchor, Tom Brokaw, who seemed to be letting viewers in on the Democrats' move when he declared that with the Democrats' ''schedule slipping so much, she was able to get on prime time.'' (Before breaking in at 10:30, NBC carried the convention on its cable channel, MSNBC.)</p>
        <p>Like the Republicans, the Democrats have a minute-by-minute master schedule, so that they know at any moment whether they are not keeping to the plan. The 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. slot is the only time in which all three broadcast networks -- which by far capture the bulk of convention watchers -- are on the air at the gatherings. And getting on all three is the most coveted media hat trick.</p>
        <p>Asked just before Mrs. Clinton's speech whether the Democrats were indeed running behind, Peter Ragone, a convention spokesman, said, ''We might be, just a little.'' Asked later for comment about the delays, Mr. Ragone said that those in charge of the program told him, ''It was not intentional.''</p>
        <p>Though the convention is intended as a crowning television moment for Vice President Al Gore, it was the president who weighed most heavily on the minds of editors and producers today. And after Mrs. Clinton finished her remarks, Mr. Clinton made his grand entrance in a manner reserved in American television culture for the best and the brightest, namely, late-night talk show hosts, movie stars and football heroes.</p>
        <p>As C-Span and other networks recorded the moment, a camera followed the president as he made his way through the backstage maze at the Staples Center, the lens trained on him as he strolled confidently. Emerging into the hall, the camera at his back, it was unclear whether he looked more like a guest host on ''Saturday Night Live'' or the star of a sequel to ''Gladiator.''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Clinton starting to speak at only shortly before 11, it was clear that the networks were being boxed into devoting a lot more time to the gathering than planned. He finished speaking at just after 11:30 p.m. Last week the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Jim Nicholson, had admonished the networks that it would be unfair to give Mr. Clinton more air time than had been allotted to Gen. Colin L. Powell, the featured speaker on the first night of the Republican convention.</p>
        <p>All three networks said Mr. Clinton's speech would be more newsworthy than General Powell's and probably worth staying with. (None ran all of the general's speech.)</p>
        <p>''In all respect to Colin Powell, I don't think they're equal in that one is the president and has been president for eight years,'' said Marc Burstein, executive producer of special events for ABC News.</p>
        <p>Like its network morning-show rivals, CBS's ''Early Show'' with Bryant Gumbel was set to kick off its week in Los Angeles today with an extensive interview with Mr. Clinton and a talk with Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>But on Friday, Lyne Pitts, the program's executive producer, got the news that the president and first lady were backing out. They also pulled out of an agreement with NBC's ''Today,'' and Mr. Clinton decided not to do ABC's ''Good Morning America'' either.</p>
        <p>''It was all set,'' Ms. Pitts said. ''Bryant was supposed to interview him Saturday afternoon; it had been booked for quite some time. I got the calls at a little bit after 9 in the morning saying that, sorry, the president's schedule would not accommodate the interview.''</p>
        <p>It is not unknown for sought-after newsmakers to bump a news show or two from their itineraries. But such a wholesale withdrawal, at a time when the news media were fixated on the Clintons, raised eyebrows.</p>
        <p>''We knew Thursday night how upset the Gore folks were with Clinton's confessional on Thursday and that would be the talk of our interview,'' Ms. Pitts said, adding that it was ''more than an assumption'' that the Clintons had dropped out to try to turn down the heat on them. Mrs. Clinton, however, did interviews tonight with anchors on all of the major broadcast and cable networks.</p>
        <p>The hoopla surrounding Mr. Clinton's appearance seemed to reflect a sense in the press corps here that Los Angeles might generate more interesting and entertaining tidbits than did Philadelphia.</p>
