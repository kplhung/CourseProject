        <p>Researchers in Malaysia have confirmed a link between fruit bats and a recently discovered virus that killed more than 100 people last year and compelled authorities to slaughter roughly a million pigs.</p>
        <p>Prof. Kenneth Lam Sai Kit, a microbiology professor at the University of Malaya, said his research team had successfully isolated strains of the deadly Nipah virus in urine collected from island flying foxes, one of the many species of fruit bats that live throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>The finding confirms that the bats are carriers or reservoirs for the virus, which last year crossed over to pigs and then to humans. With no known vaccine or cure, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has put Nipah, which was named for one of the villages it hit, in the same class of viruses as ebola and AIDS.</p>
        <p>Other scientists called Professor Lam's findings a breakthrough in understanding the virus and helping to prevent future outbreaks.</p>
        <p>''It's very, very important that Professor Lam did find the virus,'' said Dr. John S. Mackenzie, a professor of microbiology and parasitology at Australia's University of Queensland and an expert on diseases transmitted from animals to humans. ''The final proof requires that you isolate the virus from the bats.''</p>
        <p>Professor Lam's finding came just after an outbreak of Nipah in June in northern Malaysia. Health authorities in northern Perak state killed more than 1,700 hogs to prevent the disease from spreading after a woman living nearby was found to have the virus.</p>
        <p>While it remains unclear exactly how the virus is transmitted from fruit bats to pigs, numerous opportunities exist for the rare crossover to occur, Professor Lam said. Fruit trees in which bats forage for food are often near pigsties, he said, and Malaysia's pig farmers tend to live very close to their pigs. Malaysia is considering measures to protect its $400-million-a-year pig farming industry, which was crippled by last year's outbreak.</p>
        <p>Nipah first appeared as a pandemic early last year when it hit pig farms in Malaysia and slaughterhouses in nearby Singapore. Health workers initially believed they were dealing with an outbreak of Japanese encephalitis, which is transmitted from pigs to humans by mosquitoes. The symptoms were similar: high fever, aches and coma. Roughly 4 of every 10 sufferers died.</p>
        <p>Confounding this early diagnosis was the fact that some victims had been inoculated against Japanese encephalitis and that most lived near or worked on pig farms. The virus was also killing some pigs, and Japanese encephalitis does not do that.</p>
        <p>After a Malaysian microbiologist isolated the virus from the brain and spinal fluid of Nipah victims, scientists at the C.D.C. determined that it was not Japanese encephalitis but a new member of a class of viruses called paramyxoviruses that includes mumps and measles. Its closest relative, they found, was another virus called Hendra discovered in 1994 after killing 14 horses and their trainer in Australia.</p>
        <p>Hendra was carried by fruit bats, so researchers began searching for a similar link in Nipah. Scientists from the C.D.C. and from Taiwan, Japan and Australia flew to Malaysia, scouring pig farms, villages and trapping bats. Tissue samples from roughly 300 fruit bats revealed antibodies against Nipah, ''but we were never able to isolate the virus per se from any of our samples,'' said Dr. Hume Field of the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, who spent six weeks in Malaysia looking for Nipah's source.</p>
        <p>With no new evidence a year later, Professor Lam and his team set out to search themselves. In early June, he said, they spent three nights laying plastic sheets under trees full of flying foxes, collecting urine samples. Back in the lab, they found strains of Nipah that matched those recovered from humans.</p>
        <p>Though only just discovered, Nipah appeared to be a very old virus, judging from how different it was in form, Dr. Field said. Like ebola and AIDS, he said, it may have infected people on a much smaller scale years before making headlines.</p>
        <p>Researchers will now need to determine what environmental changes made Nipah so virulent. Professor Lam said that only three of his 1,000-odd samples contained the virus, which indicated that bats were by no means infected by the virus. And Professor Mackenzie, who researched the Hendra virus's transmission from bats to horses and to humans, said infections took place only under very rare circumstances, usually by direct contact with infected blood. In Nipah's case, no transmission between people appears to have occurred.</p>
        <p>''What we've probably got is one spillover event where one flying fox that was excreting virus came into contact with an unfortunate pig that consumed either the discharge or the bat,'' Dr. Field said.</p>
        <p>Professor Lam said that because Nipah can also be found in saliva, it was possible that pigs may have caught the virus by eating fruit that the bats had nibbled on.</p>
        <p>How the virus moves from pigs to humans remains unclear, but researchers believe one possibility is that people breathe in infected particles of saliva coughed up by Nipah-infected pigs.</p>
        <p>Professor Lam's findings also raised concern about the possibility that the bats, which are migratory, could carry the disease beyond Malaysia. Southeast Asia is home to several species of fruit bat, many of which are considered delicacies and have been hunted nearly to extinction. In Malaysia, for example, fruit bats are now protected by law.</p>
        <p>Professor Lam said antibodies against Nipah had been found in other species of fruit bat. Moreover, Nipah is also known to infect dogs, cats and horses, presenting the possibility that pig farms may not be the only venues for crossover.</p>
