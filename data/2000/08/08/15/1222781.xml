        <p>The Roman Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles called today for an end to abortions as he delivered the invocation at the opening of the Democratic National Convention.</p>
        <p>In his brief address, Cardinal Roger Mahony, one of the leading religious voices against abortion in California, said, ''In you, O God, we trust that you will keep us ever committed to protect the life and well-being of all people, but especially unborn children, the sick and the elderly.''</p>
        <p>It was a message that might have sounded more familiar at a Republican convention, especially with the difficulties Democrats have had in the past trying to attract Catholic leaders to speak at their conventions.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Cardinal Joseph Bernardin declined an invitation for the convention in Chicago. In 1984 and 1992, when the Democrats held conventions in New York, Cardinal John O'Connor turned them down because of the party's support of abortion rights.</p>
        <p>With Democrats trying to reach swing voters and undecided voters, Vice President Al Gore tried again, issuing an invitation last week to  Cardinal Mahony. Although the cardinal's anti-abortion message is antithetical to many Democrats, his words could be viewed as an effort to broaden the Democratic base.</p>
        <p>How far the cardinal's words spread was unclear.</p>
        <p>The invocation followed welcoming remarks by Joe Andrew, co-chairman of the Democratic Party, who opened the convention in midafternoon, a time few would be watching on television.</p>
        <p>In the main hall of the Staples Center, only a few of the 4,339 delegates were in their seats.</p>
