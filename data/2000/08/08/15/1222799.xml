        <p>Four years ago, Jenny Thompson entered the United States Olympic swimming trials as an overwhelming favorite, only to see her hopes for the Atlanta Games capsized by waves of stress and self-doubt.</p>
        <p>She qualified only for relay teams in Atlanta, and though she has five career gold medals in the relays, Thompson has never felt satisfied with her performances in the individual sprints. Now, however, she heads to the 2000 Summer Games next month in Sydney, Australia, her confidence inflated and her chances buoyed by her redemptive performances at this year's trials.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Thompson set an American record in winning the 100-meter freestyle in 54.07 seconds, a time bested this year only by the world record of 53.80 set in May by Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands. Last week, Thompson won the 100-meter butterfly, and she will duel with de Bruijn for gold medals in both events in Sydney.</p>
        <p>She will also have to contend with Dara Torres, who was second tonight in 54.62 seconds, continuing a remarkable comeback to the sport at age 33 after a seven-year retirement. Torres touched the wall first at 50 meters in 25.99 seconds, but her legs began to tire at about 75 meters and Thompson easily overtook her to the wall by more than half a second. Torres also finished second in the 100 butterfly. However, she now becomes a heavy favorite Wednesday in the 50 freestyle, which Thompson will skip, having qualified for two individual events and likely three relays in Sydney.</p>
        <p>''It's been a tough year; I feel I've persevered well,'' said Thompson, who has a somewhat tense relationship with Torres. The two now train separately. ''I think I can appreciate victory more when it's a struggle and not a cakewalk. It gives me motivation for Sydney. I know I can deal with adversity. It's a good feeling.''</p>
        <p>Lenny Krayzelburg and Tom Dolan also became double winners at the trials tonight. After winning the 100-meter backstroke last week, Krayzelburg took the 200 tonight in the slightly disappointing time of 1 minute 57.31 seconds, a second and a half slower than his world record. He is favored to win both events in Sydney.</p>
        <p>Dolan, the 1996 Olympic champion who won the 400-meter individual medley last week, finished first in the 200 I.M. tonight in 2:00.81. Kristy Kowal, who has twice missed the Olympic team by a total of two-tenths of a second, set an American record of 2:24.75 to win the women's 200-meter breaststroke after finishing third in the 100 breaststroke.</p>
        <p>In the women's 100 freestyle, it might take 53 seconds flat -- eight-tenths of a second below the current world record -- to win a gold medal in Sydney, said Richard Quick, the Olympic women's coach and the personal coach of both Thompson and Torres in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
        <p>''Whatever it takes to win, I think is in my range,'' said Thompson, 27, who is from Dover, N.H. ''When you get to the Olympics, it's a new ballgame. With the pressure and the crowd, you rarely see world records at the Olympics. This may be different. I'm going for the gold. Whatever it takes, that's what I'm going to prepare to do.''</p>
        <p>She clearly has the speed and endurance to catch other swimmers down the homestretch. Tonight, Thompson swam a patient race for the first 50 meters, then calmly and assertively took the lead as Torres's legs began to falter. Torres had built her muscular 6-foot frame to 160 pounds with rigorous flexibility and strength training, and spinning classes, but tonight she felt worn down, perhaps from overtraining.</p>
        <p>Still, Torres heads to Sydney with an apparently unprecedented accomplishment. No one within memory has ever laid off for so long and come back to contend for an Olympic medal. Torres will be the first American to swim in four Summer Games.</p>
        <p>''My legs gave out on me,'' Torres said, underscoring how difficult it is to resume an elite career beyond age 30. ''I'm going to have to do some adjusting the next four weeks. I got out of the pool and almost fell down.''</p>
        <p>The difference in the 5-11, 160-pound Thompson between four years ago and now, Quick said, is that she no longer needs swimming to validate her self-worth. There is much more in her life now. She has been accepted to medical school at Columbia University, which she plans to enter in August 2001. ''It's a maturity process she's gone through,'' Quick said. ''When your self-worth is not wrapped up in winning or losing a race, you are free to perform.''</p>
        <p>That maturation began in March 1996 after the Olympic trials, during which Thompson developed insomnia as her confidence began to sink. Quick said he told Thompson she could still enjoy herself and accomplish a great deal on the American relays at the Atlanta Olympics, or she could sulk and go through the motions. Thompson also began to learn relaxation techniques from Richard Diana, a performance expert. She trained vigorously and won three golds on the relays at the 1996 Summer Games, giving her a career total of five. Thompson is now tied with the speedskater Bonnie Blair for most gold medals ever won by an American woman.</p>
        <p>''Swimming didn't have to be my career,'' Thompson said. ''It freed me up to enjoy my passion and allowed it to be more of a hobby than a job.''</p>
        <p>When Torres came back last year, however, some strain appeared to develop between her and Thompson. They are not enemies, but also do not appear to be close. Quick has separated their training sessions. Torres said the workouts had become too intense. Others have said that Torres was voted out of the training group at Stanford University because she demanded too much attention.</p>
        <p>''Two great athletes desired a lot of individual attention and somewhat demanded it,'' Quick said.</p>
        <p>While Torres is the Beverly Hills beauty and former fashion model, Thompson has drawn much attention for appearing topless, her hands covering her breasts, in the current issue of Sports Illustrated magazine. She said she had worked hard to sculpt her body and posed so that girls could see that it was O.K. to have a muscular appearance.</p>
        <p>''I'm an athlete and athletics is about physicality,'' Thompson said.</p>
        <p>In last week's 100 butterfly, Thompson and Torres said their personal duel led them to become distracted in the final meters of the race. Tonight, Torres wore mirrored goggles and said she did not spend much time looking around at her competitors. Thompson also swam her own race and was never threatened as she controlled the finish of the race.</p>
        <p>''The last 25 meters of the 100 fly, I did get caught up in the emotion of the finish,'' Thompson said. ''Tonight, I'm really proud that I turned it around and was able to maintain my composure.''</p>
