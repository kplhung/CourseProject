        <p>An I.B.M. physicist plans to announce today that his San Jose, Calif.-based research group has succeeded in developing an advanced quantum computer. The device, composed of five computing elements, or ''quantum bits,'' is based on a molecule composed of five flourine atoms. The machine is still far from being able to perform useful real-world calculations, the company said. Still, the prototype developed by Isaac L. Chaung of I.B.M. and a group of researchers at the University of Calgary is able to solve in one step a mathematical problem that requires repeated cycles in conventional computers.</p>
