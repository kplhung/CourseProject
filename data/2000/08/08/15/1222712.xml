        <p>It might be a stretch to say that Washington Democrats are paying rapt attention to next month's primary for United States senator, in which the state insurance commissioner, Deborah Senn, and former United States Representative Maria Cantwell, now a wealthy Internet executive promoting her experience in the ''new economy,'' are battling for the right to take on the three-term Republican incumbent, Slade Gorton.</p>
        <p>Indeed, even as Ms. Senn arrived here the other evening for a campaign speech to an electricians' union that had already endorsed her, several of the electricians said they could not name the candidates in the Sept. 19 primary, and they also labored a bit to identify the issues they considered most pressing in the contest.</p>

        <p>It might be a stretch to say that Washington Democrats are paying rapt attention to next month's primary for United States senator, in which the state insurance commissioner, Deborah Senn, and former United States Representative Maria Cantwell, now a wealthy Internet executive promoting her experience in the ''new economy,'' are battling for the right to take on the three-term Republican incumbent, Slade Gorton.</p>
        <p>Indeed, even as Ms. Senn arrived here the other evening for a campaign speech to an electricians' union that had already endorsed her, several of the electricians said they could not name the candidates in the Sept. 19 primary, and they also labored a bit to identify the issues they considered most pressing in the contest.</p>
        <p>''I'm not really going to focus on that till it's closer to the time to go out and vote,'' one electrician explained.</p>
        <p>Another paused for several moments as he considered which issue was uppermost in his mind. ''I don't know,'' he said. ''I guess I really am interested in this whole Internet fight over what to do about Napster. So I'd like to see what they have to say about that.''</p>
        <p>And Ed Pecotte, a 57-year-old electrician from Port Orchard, Wash., seemed to sum up the mood of many at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers when he said: ''People are working, the economy seems to be humming along pretty well. I'd like to hear how these candidates intend to help things keep rolling along.''</p>
        <p>Despite a clear sense on the campaign trail that voters are just starting to concentrate on the race, the Democratic matchup shows signs of becoming an intriguing and bitterly fought contest. And the Washington Senate race is one that some national Democrats view as a prime opportunity for their party in its battle to take back control of the Senate, where Republicans have a 54 to 46 edge.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Cantwell and Ms. Senn, the primary is the standard double-edged sword of such contests: the candidates will probably create a lot of publicity as the primary grows nearer but also risk draining their resources and energy in the battle, with the victor having barely a month and a half to shift gears for the main bout against the well-financed Mr. Gorton.</p>
        <p>Ms. Senn got into the contest early, after several potential Democratic heavyweights, including Gov. Gary Locke, State Attorney General Christine Gregoire and Ron Sims, the county executive of King County, all took a pass on the race. (Mr. Locke is running for re-election, and Ms. Gregoire and Mr. Sims, who lost to Mr. Gorton seven years ago, seem to be interested in running for his job later.)</p>
        <p>The 51-year-old Ms. Senn has racked up dozens of endorsements from labor groups, lawmakers and others, and frequently points out that she has won statewide races twice with more than one million votes, more than Mr. Gorton got in any of his seven statewide races.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cantwell, on the other hand, enjoys the advantage of the millions of dollars she has earned as a software executive at Real Networks here, and, in some ways, getting booted out of Congress after one term in the 1994 Republican tide could turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to her politically. She has vowed to spend ''whatever it takes'' to unseat Mr. Gorton, 72, and also says she has ''real world'' private-sector experience with the Internet economy that, she says, makes her a stronger candidate than if she had stayed in Congress.</p>
        <p>Under Washington's unusual ''blanket primary'' system, all candidates for Senate, including Mr. Gorton, will be on the ballot on Sept. 19, with the top vote-getter among Democrats, regardless of her percentage, surviving to face the incumbent on the November ballot. Any third-party candidate who receives more than 1 percent of the primary vote also makes the general election. This will almost surely be the last year Washington uses such a system, though. After a United States Supreme Court ruling in June threw out a similar primary system in California, state officials here are virtually certain to change the rules to withstand a similar challenge.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cantwell, 41, has already been on the air with a series of television advertisements, describing her background and pledging to fight for ways to control the costs of prescription drugs, an issue that has emerged here, as in other states, as a major concern for many voters, especially older ones. With a fortune from stock options estimated to be worth at least $10 million and a declared willingness to spend her own money, the former congresswoman is likely to be firmly fixed in voters' minds by next month. And, for the moment anyway, she seems to be all but ignoring Ms. Senn, explaining that she can win only by making a much larger impression on the voters, not by dissecting her primary opponent's record.</p>
        <p>''I look at this as a huge task of a cynical public that really doesn't want to hear too much about politics,'' Ms. Cantwell explained the other day after a campaign event in which she had appeared with Helen Jackson, the widow of former Senator Henry M. Jackson, to support an increase in federal conservation money. ''So my challenge is bigger than Deborah Senn and Slade Gorton. It's convincing the public that you can make a difference in this process.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Senn said she had been battling insurance companies and fighting for lower drug costs for years in her state post, and she scoffed at Ms. Cantwell's interest in the subject.</p>
        <p>''Now, with all that, with all the work we've done, I'm faced with Maria Cantwell on the air spending a million bucks, telling people she's going to solve their prescription drug problems,'' Ms. Senn said in an interview this week, after speaking to the electricians' union. ''There's no record behind that ad. It is a promise, not performance.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Cantwell said she had a record in Congress on all kinds of health care issues, and she has also made computer privacy a campaign issue, noting that she was a prime player in 1994 in fighting Clinton administration proposals, later dropped, that privacy advocates feared could increase government surveillance of computers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Senn has attacked that stance, noting that Real Networks itself got into hot water a few years when it emerged that one of its software programs could store information on customers' preferences.</p>
        <p>''A privacy pledge from Maria Cantwell is like having Jesse James promote bank security,'' she said.</p>
        <p>While differing in some respects on free trade -- Ms. Cantwell was a strong supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement, while Ms. Senn has said she would probably not have voted for the accord in the form that came before Congress -- the candidates agree on many other issues. And they both identify health care, education and the environment as major campaign themes. For that matter, so does Senator Gorton.</p>
        <p>Democrats say Mr. Gorton, who has been in public life almost continuously for more than 30 years, is more conservative than most Washington residents and thus vulnerable to an upset this November. He has failed to get a 50 percent approval rating in some polls, another sign of hope for the Democrats.</p>
        <p>Gauging the candidates' support at this juncture is tricky, since voters are just starting to pay attention and Ms. Senn, who has raised $1.6 million and will probably have less to spend than Ms. Cantwell, has yet to start running television advertisements. The Democratic candidates are not scheduled to debate until next month. A statewide poll last month of 400 registered voters by Stuart Elway, an independent pollster, found 21 percent supporting Ms. Cantwell and 12 percent for Ms. Senn, with 42 percent for Mr. Gorton and most of the rest undecided.</p>
        <p>All three candidates do have at least one thing in common: they were reared in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Gorton loses, Patty Murray, a Democrat, will become the senior senator and Washington will become the third state, after California and Maine, to have two women in the Senate. Just over 40 percent of Washington's state lawmakers are women, the highest percentage in any state legislature in the nation's history.</p>
