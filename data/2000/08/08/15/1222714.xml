        <p>Op-Ed article by Daniel H Pink, Al Gore's speechwriter from 1995 to 1997, says Gore's decision to write his own acceptance speech will give him opportunity to use his own authentic voice and offer specifics for people to evaluate on their terms; says Gore may be much more in sync with voters than is commonly believed; recommends that Gore make speech conversational, not oratory, and laden with policy, and follow it with nationally televised call-in question and answer program</p>

        <p>The terrifying report hopped from sky box to sky box like the West Nile virus: Al Gore was writing his own acceptance speech. Eek! cried the talking heads and the pundits. The speech will be dull, boring. It will be -- gasp -- specific.</p>
        <p>It was probably the first time anyone has been scared by the absence of a ghost.</p>
        <p>But there may be a method to Al Gore's supposed madness -- a recognition that politics and the broader culture are in the midst of a significant transition.</p>
        <p>While the Republican Convention two weeks ago captured barely 7 percent of the viewing audience, CBS's ''Survivor'' scored ratings higher than all the convention coverage on all the broadcast and cable networks combined. Why? ''Survivor'' has real people, real suspense and no scripts.</p>
        <p>Or take Yahoo. That same week, it attracted 25 million visitors (not counting the same people coming back more than once), nearly 10 million more people than watched the elephant hats in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>By writing his own speech, speaking in his own authentic voice, and offering specifics for people to evaluate on their terms, Mr. Gore may be much more in sync with the voters than his opponent or the press corps dare to be.</p>
        <p>The Republican Convention reminded me of my worst days as a political speechwriter. I'd labor over a carefully argued, beautifully reasoned, elegantly written text. Then some grizzled senior aide would toss the draft back to me and say: ''Uh, it's fine, but you need to add a little more rhetoric'' -- as if back in my office, I had a spice rack with little bottles of phrases, a few sprinkles of which could disguise the taste of what I'd written.</p>
        <p>The punditocracy hailed George W. Bush's acceptance speech, but when The Washington Post convened a panel of swing voters, the reaction was overwhelming: Lovely speech, but where were the specifics?</p>
        <p>When Newsweek asked voters how important it is that Mr. Gore offer specifics in his convention speech, a stunning 75 percent said ''very important.'' Contrast that with 24 percent who said it was very important for him to talk about his own life experiences and 18 percent who thought it crucial that he discuss his faith.</p>
        <p>''My sense is that an Al Gore policy-laden speech might be hard going,'' said Brit Hume of Fox News when he heard that the vice president was hunched over his laptop. But that's probably because he's not one of the 41 million Americans who can't afford health insurance.</p>
        <p>If I were still advising the vice president, I'd recommend the new media full monty. Write the speech in your own voice -- make it conversation, not oratory. Deliver it your own way, and follow it with a live, nationally televised call-in question and answer program. Put all your policy proposals on the campaign Web site, and let voters plug in their own preferences to see if they agree. The era of Big Speechwriter is over.</p>
