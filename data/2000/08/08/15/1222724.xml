        <p>Seeking to bolster its portfolio of products, the Chiron Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to pay $700 million in cash to acquire the PathoGenesis Corporation, a developer of antibiotics.

        <p>Seeking to bolster its portfolio of products, the Chiron Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to pay $700 million in cash to acquire the PathoGenesis Corporation, a developer of antibiotics. Chiron will pay $38.50 a share, almost 18 percent higher than the PathoGenesis closing price of $32.75 on Friday.</p>
        <p>Chiron has been searching for about two years for companies to acquire, but this is the first deal it has made. Its difficulty in finding a mate stems in part from the sizzling rise in biotechnology stocks since last fall, driven by investor excitement over the unraveling of the human genome sequence.</p>
        <p>The increase in stock prices -- the Nasdaq biotechnology index is up 37 percent this year, though down from its peak in March -- has made acquisitions more costly. And it has allowed biotechnology companies to raise a record amount of money this year in public stock offerings, making many companies feel rich enough to go it alone rather than seek a partner.</p>
        <p>PathoGenesis, however, was an exception. In early June, with its stock trading at about half its current level, the eight-year-old company, which is based in Seattle, put itself up for sale.</p>
        <p>Wilbur H. Gantz, the company's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview that PathoGenesis was expected to become profitable in the fourth quarter of this year based on sales of its one drug, an inhaled antibiotic to treat lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. But the company needed more research muscle and an international sales force, he said. And it would have had trouble in the future fulfilling Wall Street's expectations for steadily rising earnings on the income from one drug while spending heavily to develop others.</p>
        <p>''I felt there has to be mergers in this industry in order to get critical mass,'' said Mr. Gantz, who is expected to leave the company after the merger is completed.</p>
        <p>PathoGenesis had $60 million in sales last year of its drug, called TOBI. It is developing several other antibiotics that have not yet begun clinical trials. The company recently had a paper in the journal Nature disclosing a new class of compounds that seems effective in laboratory tests and in mice against strains of tuberculosis that are resistant to other drugs.</p>
        <p>Sean Lance, Chiron's chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts that the acquisition would help make Chiron ''a global player in infectious disease and cancer.''</p>
        <p>Chiron, based in Emeryville, Calif., sold its diagnostics and vision products businesses in the late 1990's, giving it a $1.5 billion war chest to spend on building up its portfolio of drugs by internal development and acquisitions.</p>
        <p>But the company suffered setbacks this year when a drug for osteoarthritis and another for cardiovascular disease both failed to show effectiveness in clinical trials. And investors were lukewarm on the acquisition of PathoGenesis, apparently having hoped the company would make a bigger acquisition.</p>
        <p>Shares of Chiron fell $1.9375, or 4 percent, to $46.6875. PathoGenesis rose $5.21875, to $37.96875.</p>
        <p>''Given that Chiron has been looking to make a strategic acquisition for well over a year, the market was somewhat underwhelmed that it wasn't bigger than it is,'' said Dennis R. Harp, an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. But he said the acquisition made sense for Chiron.</p>
        <p>James R. Sulat, Chiron's chief financial officer, said the company was still looking for acquisitions. ''This doesn't use up all our cash,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Chiron executives said they expected steady growth in sales of TOBI, the PathoGenesis drug. Now available in the United States, Britain and Canada, it was approved last week for sale in 15 European countries. PathoGenesis has been testing the drug for use against other respiratory infections and has been working on a new type of inhaler that will be quicker and easier to use.</p>
        <p>Chiron has two drugs of its own for infectious diseases that are in late-stage clinical trials, one for AIDS and one for sepsis, a severe inflammatory condition caused by bacterial infection. The company already sells a drug called Proleukin for kidney cancer and melanoma and makes a drug sold by Schering A.G. for multiple sclerosis. Chiron also makes vaccines and test kits used by blood banks to detect viruses in donated blood.</p>
        <p>Chiron said it would take charges against earnings when the acquisition closed in the third or fourth quarter of this year. The purchase will lower earnings per share in 2001 but will add to earnings by 2003, it said.</p>
