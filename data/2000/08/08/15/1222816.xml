        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton celebrated her husband's years in office and proclaimed her faith in Al Gore to an audience of thousands of cheering Democrats tonight. She also used the moment to advance her bid for the Senate as she luxuriated in a level of attention unimaginable for a candidate conducting her first campaign for public office.</p>
        <p>By the time Mrs. Clinton arrived at the Democratic National Convention hall here, she had already been interviewed by all three network anchors for segments on the evening news, as well as by CNN's Larry King. It was a feast of prime-time exposure that left her aides ecstatic, surpassed only by the 17 minutes in prime time she enjoyed before a  partisan audience that applauded her review of her years in the White House and her mention of the political career she has embarked upon in running for senator from New York.</p>
        <p>''Bill and I are closing one chapter of our lives, and soon, we'll be starting a new one,'' she said. ''For me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in the United States Senate. I will always be profoundly grateful to all of you and to the American people for the last eight years. Really, the most important thing that I can say tonight is,  thank you.'' [Excerpt, Page A15.]</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also benefited from the lagging pace of the first night of the convention: she started 20 minutes late, assuring live coverage by all three networks.</p>
        <p>In her speech and in her interviews with the networks, Mrs. Clinton went to considerable lengths to praise the record of her husband and the credentials of the man seeking to succeed him, fulfilling the typical role of a prominent convention speaker.</p>
        <p>''I'm proud to stand here at this extraordinary moment -- the most peaceful, prosperous, promising time in our nation's history,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton was no ordinary surrogate, talking about the party's standard-bearer. Throughout her speech, she framed her praise of Mr. Gore and the Democratic Party in ways that served to reinforce the issues and attacks on her opponent in New York, Representative Rick A. Lazio. They were issues that she has raised over the summer in both campaign speeches and in her television advertisements. She discussed her support for raising the minimum wage, new gun-control laws, abortion rights and even her ill-fated advocacy of a national health care program.</p>
        <p>''I had a few ideas about health care,'' she said. '' I've learned a few  lessons since then. But I haven't given up on the goal.''</p>
        <p>She also interspersed her speech with details about her life growing up, and suggested that she played a key role in the White House in the enactment of legislation expanding foster care.</p>
        <p>With her speech tonight, Mrs. Clinton ended one of the more unusual political trips undertaken by a candidate running for office from New York. She spent four days in California, and while the purpose of the trip was to accompany Mr. Clinton for his last convention as a sitting president, she turned almost every moment into a way toward advancing her own campaign for Senate: raising money, giving interviews to New York newspapers and television stations and sitting down with Peter Jennings, Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw.</p>
        <p>And her prime-time speech was unusual in another way. Just eight years ago, another New York Senate candidate, Attorney General Bob Abrams, could not get an evening speaking slot despite the fact that the convention was in his home state.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's schedule has contrasted sharply with that of her opponent during the Republican convention just two weeks ago, when Mr. Lazio spent just one day in Philadelphia. In New York today, Mr. Lazio went to Planet Hollywood to mock Mrs. Clinton's efforts. ''What is important is being here in New York,'' Mr. Lazio said, standing in front of a cut-out photograph of Sylvester Stallone. ''I think the most important thing is to be in New York and talk about New York issues.''</p>
        <p>The first lady viewed tonight's speech as a key moment in her national life, as well as her Senate campaign. And she could not have asked for a more receptive audience. When she spoke at the Democratic convention in 1996, in a year in which she had been a target of Republican attacks, delegates had offered her an ecstatic reception.</p>
        <p>This time, after four years marked by the impeachment of her husband and his public acknowledgment of an extramarital sexual encounter, the crowd was once again exuberant.  She tried to quiet the crowd several times, and remained relaxed and poised throughout her speech. At times, she spoke passionately about  favorite topics, like child health insurance.</p>
        <p>Although it may not have been necessary, there were elaborate preparations to get the crowd warmed up for Mrs. Clinton and the president.</p>
        <p>Thirty minutes before she was to speak, young aides circulated through the arena passing out armloads of ''Hillary'' signs.</p>
        <p>''We've got to get it together,'' one woman called out in the New York delegation. Another tried to get a chant going -- 'We need a woman senator in New York state now'' --  prompting Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who was elected in 1998, to stand and say, ''At least you didn't say it two years ago.''</p>
        <p>The effort worked: On the floor, the aisles were packed to the point that it was nearly impossible for anyone to move -- even senators, like Tom Harkin of Iowa, who entered under the escort of several aides.</p>
        <p>In the New York section, 14 delegates stood with signs that spelled ''Senator Hillary.'' Thousands more waved ''Hillary'' signs.</p>
        <p>For the first time in the evening, the arena exploded with flash bulbs. Hardly a single Gore-Lieberman sign could be seen throughout her address. Mrs. Clinton took the podium to the sounds of the song ''New York, New York,'' and delegates in the hall sang along as Mrs. Clinton prepared to speak.</p>
        <p>She made no mention of Mr. Lazio in her speech. She was more discursive in the interviews she taped during the day with the network anchors, using a question about why some voters dislike the Clintons as a way of hitting the issues with which she has sought to distinguish herself  from Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''Those are not people that are ever going to vote for me and what I stand for,'' she said on CBS. ''You know, they aren't pro-choice, they are happy to let the gun lobby, you know, decide what our laws are. They have a very different view of where we should go when it comes to the future of New York and America.''</p>
        <p>Asked in several interviews today about her husband's confessional speech last Thursday and whether it hurt her, she said he had ''an enormous amount of resilience and faith,'' but added that her family and her feelings were private.</p>
        <p>The very fact that Mrs. Clinton  agreed to such an extensive schedule of network interviews was notable. She has until now resisted doing interviews with the national media; her aides argued it would not help -- and might actually hurt -- her effort  to transform herself into a candidate in New York.</p>
