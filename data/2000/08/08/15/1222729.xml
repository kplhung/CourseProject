        <p>The Sunbeam Corporation, the maker of small appliances, posted a wider second-quarter loss today and said it would sell its Oster barber, beauty and animal-grooming products business. Shares of Sunbeam fell 16.7 percent.</p>
        <p>The loss from operations was $54 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with $37 million, or 37 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales fell 7.8 percent, to $609.6 million from $660.9 million.</p>
        <p>The quarterly loss, Sunbeam's 10th consecutive one, was wider than the loss of 33 cents a share that analysts had expected, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Sunbeam said lenders amended its credit agreement to reflect the results.</p>
        <p>Sunbeam took charges totaling $27 million, or 25 cents a share, mostly for legal costs and plant closings, making its net loss $80.2 million, or 75 cents a share.</p>
        <p>In the period a year earlier, the company took charges totaling $10 million, or 10 cents a share, largely for Year 2000-related expenses and legal costs, resulting in a net loss of $46.9 million, or 47 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Shares of Sunbeam fell 43.75 cents, to $2.1875.</p>
        <p>Sunbeam sold fewer Powermate generators, Coleman camp stoves and lanterns than it did in the quarter a year earlier, when some customers feared that the arrival of the Year 2000 might disrupt computer systems. The company, based in Boca Raton, also makes First Alert smoke detectors and Mr. Coffee coffee makers.</p>
        <p>''Sunbeam needs to look at everything it has and see what the most judicious use of its assets is,'' said Ned Armstrong, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Oster's professional products business could sell for $75 million to $125 million, Mr. Armstrong said. The proceeds would help Sunbeam pay down debt taken on by Albert J. Dunlap, who was ousted as chairman in June 1998, after he acquired the Coleman Company, First Alert Inc. and Signature Brands USA Inc.</p>
        <p>Sunbeam has $2.4 billion in debt, with $1.5 billion of that owed to banks. The company paid $53 million in interest in the quarter, Mr. Armstrong said. Its market value is about $235 million. The Oster unit is being sold because it needs a unique distribution network, Sunbeam said. The business makes electric and battery-powered hair clippers, replacement blades and other grooming products.</p>
