        <p>While Elliott is free to practice, his return hinges on an appeal to the league Wednesday of a two-game suspension. A Nassau County court earlier this year fined him $250 and ordered 50 hours of community service for a misdemeanor conviction in a bar fight.</p>
        <p>A misdemeanor charge against Fabini was dismissed.</p>
        <p>''I'm very optimistic,'' Elliott said of the appeal.</p>
