        <p>Freedom is no mere slogan to the residents of Lawnside, N.J.</p>
        <p>The tiny borough was founded in the 17th century as a slave community called Snow Hill, then purchased by a Philadelphia abolitionist who renamed it Freehaven and divided the property among its occupants.</p>
        <p>It was incorporated in 1926 as the Borough of Lawnside, and is now a predominantly black, middle-class, 1.4-square-mile suburb in Camden County. It has a population of just under 3,000, including descendants of Snow Hill founders, among them Clarence Still, the borough historian.</p>
        <p>So when the Lawnside Borough Council passed a law limiting residents' rights to assemble, a group of about 30 residents, already mobilized to protest a proposed civic center, decided to fight. The group, Citizens for a Better Lawnside, called the American Civil Liberties Union, and yesterday the A.C.L.U. filed a suit in United States District Court in Camden seeking to abolish the statute.</p>
        <p>''The irony is, we did something long ago so we would have a voice, have a say in our community, and then we get an ordinance like this 150 years later,'' said Donald Anderson, 54, a machinist who is president of the group. ''This particularly hurts us because we feel, as an African-American community, we should be the last ones to impeach somebody from speaking their mind.''</p>
        <p>The local law, ''An Ordinance Establishing Rules and Regulations for Parades and Special Events,'' requires groups or individuals seeking to hold a demonstration or other gathering to apply for a permit 45 days in advance and to have liability insurance in an amount to be determined by the police chief. The law, adopted May 3, also requires that the borough be reimbursed for related police overtime.</p>
        <p>The 45-day notice provision is an unreasonable burden that violates the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, according to Frank L. Corrado, who is handling the case for the A.C.L.U. Court rulings, the lawyer said, have upheld requirements of no more than 48 hours' notice. Mr. Corrado also said the reimbursement and insurance provisions allowed local officials too much discretion and were vulnerable to abuse.</p>
        <p>The mayor and Council members, all of whom are black and Democrats, adopted the ordinance after the citizens group had staged a protest against a plan to build a new civic center. The center was to be in a residential neighborhood, where longstanding residents might have lost their homes under eminent domain. Borough officials, including the mayor, did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment on the lawsuit.</p>
