        <p>Representatives for Larry Ellison, the chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation, officially announced yesterday his challenge for the America's Cup in New Zealand in 2003. Ellison, traveling in Europe, was unavailable for comment.</p>
        <p>Speaking from San Francisco, where Ellison's challenge will be based, the syndicate's general manager, Paul Cayard, said that Ellison's crew would sail under the Oracle Racing Team banner and most likely represent the St. Francis Yacht Club.

        <p>Representatives for Larry Ellison, the chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation, officially announced yesterday his challenge for the America's Cup in New Zealand in 2003. Ellison, traveling in Europe, was unavailable for comment.</p>
        <p>Speaking from San Francisco, where Ellison's challenge will be based, the syndicate's general manager, Paul Cayard, said that Ellison's crew would sail under the Oracle Racing Team banner and most likely represent the St. Francis Yacht Club. Last week, Cayard confirmed that he had sold Ellison the assets of his America One syndicate, with which he unsuccessfully challenged for the cup last spring.</p>
        <p>If Ellison is successful in his 2003 challenge, Cayard said, he will then defend the cup in San Francisco Bay. ''He feels the bay would be a great place to host and showcase the event,'' Cayard said.</p>
        <p>The group's chief operating officer, Bill Erkelens, the former skipper of Ellison's maxi-yacht Sayonara, said that Ellison grew serious about a cup challenge three months ago. ''When he heard that a lot of the Team New Zealand group were leaving, he decided he might want to jump into the game,'' Erkelens said. ''His enthusiasm and interest has grown every day.''</p>
        <p>Erkelens also said Ellison might have an on-the-water role with the effort. ''He would like to be involved as much as his schedule allows,'' Erkelens said.</p>
        <p>Ellison has secured the naval architect Bruce Farr's office, in Annapolis, Md., as his principal yacht designers. The New Zealand cup veteran Chris Dickson will be the skipper. Along with several former members of the America One team, the Kiwis Robbie Naismith and Mark Turner have joined the Oracle group. The team will begin training in New Zealand this fall.</p>
