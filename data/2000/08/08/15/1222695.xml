        <p>Gail Collins Op-Ed column on Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles says more is going to heard about Al Gore in coming days than one would think humanly possible, and absolutely nothing is going to happen without assistance of a famous entertainer; says country is moving into new territory with Pres Clinton's farewell speech, and next president, whoever he is, is not likely to shock, appall, mystify or interest us the way Clinton did</p>

        <p>Al Gore has been hovering outside California waiting for the Clintons to depart, like a host tapping his foot at the door while the longest-winded guest at the party launches into one last anecdote by the coat rack.

        <p>Al Gore has been hovering outside California waiting for the Clintons to depart, like a host tapping his foot at the door while the longest-winded guest at the party launches into one last anecdote by the coat rack. But now the convention is his, his, his, and we are going to hear more about Mr. Gore over the next three days than you might have thought humanly possible.</p>
        <p>One of the major topics of speculation has been how many times the organizers can manage to remind voters that Mr. Gore served in Vietnam, unlike some presidential candidates we could name. The answer, it appears, is around fifteen jillion. They are, in fact, planning to devote an entire day to the salute to Vietnam veterans. Did we mention that Mr. Gore volunteered?</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who has so far failed to attract the great droves of female voters a Democrat needs to get elected president, is going for lots and lots and lots of women on the podium. And more power to him. As the candidate himself pointed out the other day, he was raised to believe ''that men and women are equal, if not more so.''</p>
        <p>However, we are definitely not going to hear from Jane Fee, a 73-year-old World War II veteran who is also the nation's first openly transgender delegate. Despite the Minnesota delegation's efforts to interest the convention in Ms. Fee's story, she failed to make the publicity machine's list of interesting delegates. The party apparently felt we'd be more fascinated by ''an independent family farmer whose family lives and works without health insurance'' or a ''Texas state representative who is familiar with the Children's Health Program.''</p>
        <p>For the rest of this week absolutely nothing is going to happen here without the assistance of a famous entertainer. Mr. Gore began his march to the convention by introducing Joe Lieberman -- have we pointed out that he is the first Jewish candidate for vice president? -- with the help of the pop star Jewel, who is the proud owner of several platinum records and her own humanitarian foundation that attempts ''to inspire positive change on global, community and individual levels.'' The vice president spent part of last weekend in Ohio with Rob Reiner, who is trying to burnish Mr. Gore's reputation as a fun guy. At the convention (which features a health care symposium led by Jimmy Smits), his name will be put in nomination by Tommy Lee Jones. Mr. Jones was Mr. Gore's roommate at Harvard, a school he attended shortly before he went into the Army, where he served in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is not, of course, as close to the entertainment community as the Clintons are, but then the Clintons did not serve in Vietnam or pick Joseph Lieberman as their running mate. The president and first lady spent days here being feted and donated to by the Hollywood community. This is one of those aspects of being a politician that sounds like more fun than it actually is. If Mrs. Clinton gets elected to the Senate, she will have paid for it with the night she sat listening to Paul Anka sing a salute to the Mideast peace process.</p>
        <p>As he wandered around town from one event to the next, the president was also a perpetual reminder of how much better he is at this game than his vice president, his wife or anybody else. At an event sponsored by several Jewish organizations at the Sony studios (where Mr. Clinton was unfortunately positioned right in front of a billboard for the movie ''Hollow Man''), he gave a foreign policy talk of really exquisite pitch. Like Mario Cuomo in his prime, Mr. Clinton can make the members of a large audience feel as if they're sitting in his living room after dinner, having a great conversation.</p>
        <p>Now all eyes turn to Mr. Gore, a man who can make people sitting in his living room after dinner feel as if they're in a large audience, taking notes. From now on, the convention is going to be made in the vice president's image. There will be a lot of issues and many themes. Vietnam veterans' day will be Thursday, which is also ''visions of the future'' day, which is not to be confused with ''the promises of tomorrow'' day,  which happens to be today.</p>
        <p>We're moving into new territory. The old order passed last night with Bill Clinton's farewell speech. The next president, whoever he is, is not likely to shock, appall, mystify or interest us the way this one did.</p>
        <p>We're gonna miss the big guy. Just you wait.</p>
