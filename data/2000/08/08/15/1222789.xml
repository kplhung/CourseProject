        <p>As the Liberty's lead mounted last night against the Washington Mystics, Tari Phillips's mind churned back to Game 1 in their Women's National Basketball Association playoff series. The Liberty squandered an 18-point lead on Saturday before converting to a zone defense to confound the Mystics and escape with a victory.</p>
        <p>Phillips and her teammates were determined to learn from that experience before 15,309 screaming fans at Madison Square Garden last night.</p>
        <p>The Liberty surged ahead by 15 at the half and still led by 14 early in the second half. Time to relax?</p>
        <p>''We didn't think we were there this time,'' Phillips said. ''The last time we made mental mistakes.''</p>
        <p>This time the Liberty embraced the potential blowout, completing 40 minutes of industrious basketball for a 78-57 victory to close out the series, two games to none.</p>
        <p>No zone or other surprises were necessary.</p>
        <p>''I was expecting us to have a blood-and-guts game like we had in Washington,'' Liberty Coach Richie Adubato said. ''Obviously, the home court helped a lot.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty returns to the Eastern Conference finals, beginning Thursday against either Orlando or Cleveland, for the third time in the W.N.B.A.'s four years. New York has never won the championship.</p>
        <p>Members of the Liberty wore T-shirts emblazoned with the words ''unfinished business'' during practice on Sunday. But the team, which finished with the best regular-season record in the Eastern Conference at 20-12, at least finished the immediate business of dispatching the Mystics, an erratic team at best whose regular-season record was 14-18.</p>
        <p>Becky Hammon of the Liberty was 3 of 5 from 3-point range on her way to 19 points, and the Liberty had three others in double figures. Phillips, who picked up her trophy as the league's most improved player earlier in the day and sang the national anthem before the game, had 15 points. Tamika Whitmore and Vickie Johnson each scored 10.</p>
        <p>Hammon punctuated her night with a no-look, left-handed bank shot that brought the house down. ''I have been due for a big game,'' she said. ''The shots were there for me tonight and they were falling for me tonight. Our team did a great job of finding the open person.''</p>
        <p>All four of the Liberty's top scorers benefited from point guard Teresa Weatherspoon's largess. She handed out 10 assists and helped make the Mystics' fatigue-impaired press even less of a factor.</p>
        <p>Mystics Coach Darrell Walker could no longer coax emphatic full-court defense out of his club. And he could not get a superstar's performance out of Chamique Holdsclaw, who was playing in her first playoff series. Holdsclaw managed just 12 points and 3 rebounds.</p>
        <p>The Mystics won two of three against the Liberty in the regular season, but their lack of playoff experience proved to be their undoing. Even Vicky Bullett, the lone Mystic who had playoff experience before this series, felt the pressure. She turned in an anemic line of 8 points and 1 rebound. The other Mystic front-court starter, center Murriel Page, had 7 points and 3 rebounds.</p>
        <p>''This is not the way we wanted to end the season,'' Walker said, ''but it was good that they got a chance to experience the playoffs as a young basketball team.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty outrebounded the Mystics by 31-19, outshot them by 50 percent to 45 percent, and outhustled them from tip-off to buzzer in gaining its 11th straight triumph at home.</p>
        <p>New York trotted out to a 15-point halftime lead and gave ground just once, when Washington cut the deficit to 14 with less than 13 minutes to play. From then on, the Liberty built its lead.</p>
        <p>With 4 minutes 48 seconds left in the first half, Washington trailed by only 7 points after Holdsclaw worked inside for three straight layups to make it 26-19. But Hammon hit a 3-pointer to ignite a 9-2 run.</p>
        <p>Adubato pledged to come up with a few trap-breaking maneuvers after New York surrendered 13 points off turnovers in the backcourt in Game 1's 72-63 victory. Last night, New York committed just 6 turnovers in the initial 20 minutes while forcing Washington into 9.</p>
        <p>''We knew that we had our determination on defense and executing on offense,'' Johnson said.</p>
