        <p>President Clinton delivered seven speeches before he finally delivered the speech that brought him here. But the president, who has delivered so many famously long and unedited speeches and rarely let small things like an official schedule get in his way, had to start canceling events because he had not left time to actually finish the Big Address.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton burned away the time for speechwriting that had been carved out of his busy round of Hollywood parties by lingering with Barbra Streisand at her home on Sunday afternoon after a $10 million fund-raiser for his presidential library.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton squeezed in some writing in his armor-plated limousine as his motorcade moved between events. But he got so strapped for time in the end that his staff had to cancel speeches before black and Latino delegates to make sure he finished his address.</p>
        <p>Before he finally entered the convention hall tonight, Mr. Clinton had spoken at receptions, soirees, rallies, dinners and concerts. And his schedule included only a minimal amount of time for soaking up applause before the three more speeches he scheduled after the convention adjourned for the day.</p>
        <p>Despite his wife's promise not to hog Vice President Al Gore's spotlight, Mr. Clinton did not exactly just pop into town to deliver his farewell. He flew here on Friday, arriving at the convention considerably earlier than did President Ronald Reagan and President Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose valedictory speeches in 1988 and 1960 Mr. Clinton's staff has been citing as a point of comparison for Mr. Clinton's appearance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton hardly needed to enter the Staples Center to get applause from the Democrats here. The praise came in videotaped remembrances, giddy screams of appreciation and numerous toasts that began on Friday and continued all weekend.</p>
        <p>''It was kind of like a family reunion,'' said Levi Phillips, a delegate from Berryville, Ark., after Mr. Clinton appeared at a Sunday night reception for Arkansas delegates.</p>
        <p>And at every stop, there was that pesky reminder of work not yet finished. ''Those of you who want to shake the president's hand, please understand that he has a rather important engagement this evening,'' Bob Chase, the president of the National Education Association, told the excited teachers jockeying to get near Mr. Clinton after he spoke at an afternoon tribute.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton loves to shake hands, but this time he jumped off the stage and walked swiftly to his presidential limousine for a couple hours of speech preparation.</p>
        <p>Earlier, foreign policy experts had toasted his role as a peacemaker at a reception held by the National Democratic Institute. Paul Kirk, who heads the group, praised Mr. Clinton's ''tireless energy to the advancement of true democracy these last eight years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, in recent days, has also spoken -- and been spoken of -- at Ms. Streisand's house, at a faux Main Street on a studio lot and at large homes and hotel ballrooms throughout this sprawling city.</p>
        <p>On Sunday night, Hillary Rodham Clinton broke away from a gathering of close friends to work on her convention speech into the night. But Mr. Clinton stayed up late rubbing shoulders with longtime political allies. Before he went to bed, he told aides to cancel the speeches before black and Latino delegates that had been set for today.</p>
        <p>White House aides said that Mr. Clinton has been so focused on the moment that he has had little time to get too sentimental. Aides said they expected that he might reflect on the symbolic passing of the torch to Mr. Gore after he returns to Washington and leaves next weekend for three days of vacation in Lake Placid, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''I really don't view this convention as a period of nostalgia for him because I think he thinks he has a very important role here,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, ''and he's been energized by this role.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who was being rushed out of town by Gore aides one day earlier than he had originally wanted, arose early today and began scrawling new lines in the latest draft of his speech.</p>
        <p>''America is more confident, hopeful and just, more secure and free,'' he jotted in the margin of the speech this morning, an aide said, as he worked alone in his penthouse suite, ''because we offered a vision and worked to achieve it.''</p>
        <p>Later, he continued to hone the remarks with his aides. Should he include the line comparing Republican tax proposals to the Publisher's Clearinghouse sweepstakes pitched by Ed McMahon? Mr. Clinton has been testing the line for weeks in fund-raising speeches and liked the reaction it always prompted. But some aides argued against it, and Mr. Clinton relented.</p>
        <p>This morning, Mr. Clinton ran through the text more than once at a lectern set up on the 30th floor of the St. Regis Hotel. He rattled it off in about 28 minutes, which campaign officials figured would be about twice as long with applause. When he finished one run-through, he looked around at his aides.</p>
        <p>''So, guys, what do you think?''</p>
        <p>They all told him they loved it, one of them reported afterward.</p>
