        <p>Atlanta is so big and hot that it makes its own weather, and scientists have the pictures to prove it.</p>
        <p>While analyzing weather data that was collected during the 1996 Summer Olympics, Dr. Robert Bornstein, a professor of meteorology at San Jose State University in California, saw a pattern in the winds.</p>
        <p>The heat-absorbing roofs and pavement were warming the air, and the hot air was rising, sucking air from all directions into the city. Dr. Bornstein surmised what was happening next: as the warm air rose, it cooled, condensing into clouds and rain.</p>
        <p>Satellite images backed him up, revealing several instances in which thunderstorms erupted over Atlanta, seemingly out of nowhere, and dumped rain on the city, usually at its southeast and northeast edges.</p>
        <p>''We documented all the steps in the sequence,'' Dr. Bornstein said. In the satellite images, he said, ''you will not see any other clouds upwind or downwind.''</p>
        <p>The idea that cities generate their own heat, and alter their climates as a result, is not new. Dr. Bornstein observed similar thunderstorms appearing over New York City more than two decades ago based on radar images, and other cities probably create their own storms, too.</p>
        <p>But in recent years, scientists using high-tech sensors have produced a more detailed picture of how human activities change the weather.</p>
        <p>Over the past four years, researchers from the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., have flown jets equipped with infrared cameras over Salt Lake City, Sacramento, Baton Rouge, La., and Atlanta, producing block-by-block temperature maps. Parks were cool -- plants are full of cooling water, and trees also provide shade -- while asphalt parking lots were hot.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, though, the hottest buildings were often the newest. In Salt Lake City, the Scott M. Matheson Courthouse, a dark-roofed building that opened a couple of years ago, is a white-hot splotch in the infrared photograph, suggesting a roof temperature of about 170 degrees. Across the street to the east, the century-old, castle-like City and County Building is a relatively cool red.</p>
        <p>In the era of universal air-conditioning, builders may have focused more on durability and cost of roofs than on their ability to absorb or reflect heat.</p>
        <p>''We don't necessarily think about making things cool because everything is air-conditioned,'' said Dr. Dale A. Quattrochi, a senior scientist at Marshall and co-leader of the NASA heat island research.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the heat-island effect is growing as suburbia expands. For instance, Atlanta's urban heat island now covers at least 17 square miles.</p>
        <p>''It's a semicultural mindset change.'' Dr. Quattrochi said. ''We start paving over things and we start cutting down trees.''</p>
        <p>The NASA team expects to turn its infrared cameras on Houston as soon as next week, as part of a larger effort by Texas and federal agencies to track smog there. More heat speeds the chemical reactions that create ozone, the primary component of smog.</p>
        <p>''One of the things that's interesting about Houston is it is an extremely large city in terms of the built-up area,'' Dr. Quattrochi said. At 572 square miles, he said, ''It's going to be the largest urban area we've studied to date.''</p>
        <p>Unlike other cities, Houston does not have zoning laws, and its industrial, commercial and residential buildings are all mixed together. By comparing data from the different cities, the NASA researchers want to better understand how the heating effect differs among different urban landscapes.</p>
        <p>The heat-island effect was first recorded almost 200 years ago, by Luke Howard, an amateur meteorologist in England. Beginning in 1807, he started comparing temperatures from several sites within London with those measured a few miles beyond the city's edge.</p>
        <p>''Thus,'' Mr. Howard wrote in his book, ''The Climate of London'' in 1818, ''under the varying circumstances of different sites, different instruments, and different positions of the latter, we find London always warmer than the country, the average excess of its temperature being 1.579 degrees.''</p>
        <p>Today, average temperatures in the largest cities can range 5 to 10 degrees hotter than surrounding areas. Besides discomfort, the added heat also increases the need for air-conditioning, which in turn contributes to other air quality problems. The laboring air-conditioners consume more electricity, which causes nonnuclear power plants to spew out more of the chemical ingredients for the making of ozone.</p>
        <p>But once made, these effects can be unmade. In a 1998 study, scientists at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., concluded that residents and businesses in the New York City area could cut their summertime air-conditioning costs by $22 million by swapping dark roofs with more reflective ones. Outdoor summer temperatures could also drop a couple of degrees.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the reflective roofs would raise heating bills by $6 million in winter. ''In the wintertime, you want the roof to be hot,'' said Steven Konopacki, staff research associate at Lawrence Berkeley and a member of the heat island research group. Still, the net savings would be $16 million a year.</p>
        <p>And the benefits cascade. According to the computer simulations, a drop in temperature of a couple of degrees can reduce levels of ozone ''on the order of 5 percent to 10 percent, sometimes up to 20 percent,'' said Dr. Haider Taha, a Lawrence Berkeley scientist. ''You slow down the cooking rate of smog.''</p>
        <p>Lawrence Berkeley researchers are also working on making lighter-colored asphalts and roof shingles that come in different colors but that efficiently reflect infrared light.</p>
        <p>One reason black roofs dominate the urban landscape is that they cost less. ''Some bad habits have developed, at least in the States,'' Mr. Konopacki said.</p>
        <p>But reduced electric bills could more than offset the initial difference in price. Mr. Konopacki cited a medical office building in Davis, Calif., that had a ''typical commercial building roof,'' reflecting about 24 percent of the sunlight that hit it. When the roof needed to be replaced in 1997, the Berkeley researchers persuaded the building owner to use a white roof that reflected 60 percent of the sunlight. Air-conditioning costs dropped 18 percent.</p>
        <p>The NASA and Berkeley researchers hope the data will catch the attention of architects and builders.</p>
        <p>''Historically, that hasn't been part of their curriculum,'' said Dr. Jeff Luvall, who runs the NASA heat island research program with Dr. Quattrochi. ''They're looking at aesthetics and budgets.''</p>
        <p>Georgia has revised its building code for commercial buildings to encourage the use of reflective roofs, and counties around Atlanta have passed or are considering ordinances to preserve remaining trees. Fifty-three roofing products now carry the federal Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star label, which indicates that the roofs will reflect at least 65 percent of the sunlight when new and at least 50 percent three years later.</p>
        <p>Some sellers of reflective roofing, like Craig Lease of the Stockton Roofing Company in California, include NASA images in their sales materials. ''When you can back up your words with NASA data,'' Mr. Lease said, ''people listen.''</p>
