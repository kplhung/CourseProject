        <p>Players can increase their off-season value by giving strong performances the year before they become free agents. Management, therefore, often tries to tie up those players with long-term contracts before they hit the open market. The Mets have several important players who will be free agents this winter -- and two special cases.</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine and General Manager Steve Phillips, of course, are working without contracts for next year.</p>
        <p>The Mets are playing their best baseball of the season now, and if their success continues deep into the postseason, Valentine and Phillips will conceivably increase their attractiveness to other prospective employers.</p>
        <p>Fred Wilpon, the Mets' co-owner, has stuck to a consistent strategy: Valentine and Phillips, he said, will be evaluated at the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Wilpon seemed to imply he was not concerned about the possibility that Valentine or Phillips might go elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''We have long-term relationships with both of those guys, so the relationship runs very strong both ways,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Phillips has spent his entire 10-year front-office career with the Mets. Valentine managed the Mets' Class AAA Norfolk team in 1994 and 1996, when he was promoted to Mets manager. He has strong ties to the Los Angeles Dodgers, whose senior vice president, Tommy Lasorda, is a mentor of Valentine's. Should the Dodgers cut ties with Davey Johnson this winter, that job could be intriguing to Valentine.</p>
        <p>Wilpon maintains that there is no rush to secure Valentine and Phillips during the season.</p>
        <p>''I said right from the beginning of the season that the organization will take care of that at the end of the season and that I would only say they are doing good jobs,'' Wilpon said. ''They have been doing a good job, irregardless of the fact that right now, it's a high. There's a long way to go to the end of the season. But it'll be addressed in due course, and they understand that.''</p>
        <p>This is the Mets' fourth winning season in a row, and Wilpon disputed the idea that Valentine and Phillips had anything left to prove to the owners.</p>
        <p>''I didn't say they had to show me any more,'' he said. ''We do things in an orderly manner, after the contracts are completed.''</p>
        <p>Valentine and Phillips both declined to comment on their contract status. But speaking generally about his team, Valentine said: ''I think anybody could have managed this team, so far. Maybe it's going to get more difficult. But this is a veteran group of guys who always know what they're doing.''</p>
        <p>Such veteran stability is important, said Valentine, who noted that the kind of ''crazy stuff'' that has marked his tenure has cropped up less often in recent months.</p>
        <p>''It helps that the guys who have been around the longest, the guys with the big stripes, we've been here together,'' he said, naming John Franco, Mike Piazza, Robin Ventura and Al Leiter. ''We bled together; we sweat together. We've won things together. That helps.''</p>
        <p>Correction, Please</p>
        <p>The right-handed pitcher Lesli Brea, one of four players the Mets sent to the Baltimore Orioles for Mike Bordick last month, said after his major league debut Sunday that he is 26 years old, not 21, as he is listed in the Mets' media guide. (He also said his first name is actually spelled Leslie.)</p>
        <p>Steve Phillips said Brea informed Mets officials during this season that he was older than his listed age, and Phillips suspected Brea was 23. Phillips said the subject of Brea's age never came up in trade discussions with the Orioles, who apparently believed Brea was 21, as listed.</p>
        <p>Brea, who was born in the Dominican Republic but went to high school in New Jersey, was signed by the Seattle Mariners as a nondrafted free agent in 1996 and traded to the Mets two years later.</p>
        <p>Shea's Home Charm</p>
        <p>The Mets entered last night's game with the best home record in the majors, at 40-18. That led Valentine to remark that maybe there is something to playing home games at the sixth-oldest park in the majors: Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>''Maybe the other teams don't like to play here,'' he said. ''Maybe they get spoiled by all the other new parks and they come here and get depressed.''</p>
