        <p>Wooing the Big Donors  With a party outside Spago in Beverly Hills and a late-night dessert reception with President Clinton, the Democratic Party has been as aggressive as the Republicans in using its convention to court its biggest donors, trying to put them in the mood to write new checks for the fall campaign. In the official parlance, these were not fund-raisers, but ''donor servicing'' events.</p>

        <p>The New Missile Gap  The missile-defense issue is back full force in the debate between the parties. The Republican platform calls for a missile system to be built as soon as possible; the Democratic platform calls the Republican plan unproven and ill-conceived.</p>

        <p>Playing in Prime Time  The convention program ran just late enough for the speech by Hillary Rodham Clinton to be broadcast in prime time on all three major networks. Then President Clinton made his entrance tracked by a camera, in a manner usually reserved for late-night talk show hosts, movie stars and football heroes.</p>

        <p>Bradley Releases Delegates  In the last symbolic act of his failed presidential campaign, former Senator Bill Bradley released his 390 delegates to Vice President Al Gore, telling them that ''Al Gore will stand for the things we fought for in our campaign, and he deserves our support.''</p>
