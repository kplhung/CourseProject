        <p>CHINA: EDITOR DETAINED  The Beijing police formally detained Bei Ling, the American-based editor of an independent literary journal. The move gives the authorities 30 days to investigate Mr. Bei. It is not yet clear why he was picked up, though the police have also seized several hundred copies of his journal, which carries a photo of the exiled dissident Wang Dan and a poem by a dissident literary critic, Liu Xiaobo.</p>

        <p>CHINA: MESSAGE TO ARAFAT  After talks with Yasir Arafat, President Jiang Zemin appeared to sidestep supporting the Palestinian intention to declare an independent state on Sept. 13 with or without a peace accord. Although Mr. Arafat's spokesman said Mr. Jiang had expressed support for ''any Palestinian decision,'' Mr. Jiang said in a statement issued after the meeting, ''We believe that the Palestinian National Authority led by Mr. Arafat will think it over and declare statehood at an appropriate time to achieve the best possible results.''</p>

        <p>NORTH KOREA: ROCKET SALES  Kim Jong Il told a delegation of South Korean media representatives that North Korea had been selling rockets to Iran and Syria, The Korea Herald, an English-language paper, reported. He told the group that the sales had raised much-needed cash and could be abandoned only if the United States was willing to compensate for it. The United States has been demanding that North Korea abandon its missile development program, whose extent is not fully known.</p>

        <p>SOUTH KOREA: ANNIVERSARY AMNESTY  Kim Dae Jung announced an amnesty for 30,647 people to mark the 55th anniversary of liberation from Japanese rule. With the amnesty, an annual event, the president pardons a range of crimes from parking violations to low-level corruption. He also said he planned to revise the national security law, long criticized by the United States and rights groups.</p>

        <p>PAKISTAN: RALLY ON KASHMIR  Around 10,000 people gathered in Karachi to support Kashmiri independence from India as Pakistan marked its 53rd Independence Day. The rally was organized by an Islamic group whose leader, a cleric named Masood Azhar, was released by India in December to end an airline hijacking. Pakistan-based groups fighting in Kashmir threatened to assault on India's Independence Day, a day after Pakistan's.</p>

        <p>INDIA: BHOPAL PROTEST  Thousands of survivors of the 1984 Bhopal chemical disaster in central India took part in a ''cyberprotest'' outside the city's deserted Union Carbide factory, sending e-mails from makeshift Internet booths. Demonstrators were demanding decontamination of the water supply, the event's sponsor, Greenpeace, said in a statement.</p>

        <p>INDIA: CONCESSIONS IN HOSTAGE CASE  Tamil Nadu state is planning to set free five militants to speed the release of Rajkumar, a film star kidnapped by Veerappan, a notorious bandit, an official said. Two militants belong to the Tamil National Liberation Army and the others to the Tamil Nation Retrieval Force, which was banned after the 1991 assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. Other demands include making Tamil the only language in Tamil Nadu schools.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: KOHL DECLINES UNITY INVITATION  Helmut Kohl, who as chancellor seized the opportunity to reunify his country, said he would not attend the 10th anniversary unity celebration in Dresden on Oct. 3. The decision reflected his awkward position in his Christian Democratic Party since he was implicated in a financial scandal late last year. Kurt Biedenkopf, the state premier of Saxony, whose capital is Dresden, is an old rival of Mr. Kohl within the party.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: FUNDAMENTALISTS' TRIAL  Seventeen Islamic fundamentalists went on trial in Ankara for the murder of four intellectuals supporting the secular government. An indictment demanding the death sentence for nine defendants asserted that an Iranian Revolutionary Guards group and the intelligence organization Sawama had trained them. The victims were a scholar, Muammer Aksoy; a journalist, Ugur Mumcu; a former culture minister, Ahmet Taner Kislali; and a theologian, Bahriye Ucok.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: HOT AIR IN PARADISE  A few hundred residents briefly cut off the main road into St.-Tropez to protest against jet-setters' increased reliance on helicopters to avoid traffic jams. ''Ten years ago,'' the demonstrators' spokesman, Gerard Delorme, said, ''roosters were singing. Now, with up to 30 helicopters landing every day near my home, I'm living in hell.'' Farmers have run a lucrative trade, allowing wealthy tourists' helicopters to land in their fields for about $70 each. Authorities closed the resort's landing pad two years ago after protests over noise.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: ARMY RAID FREES 5  The army said it freed five Colombians and a German in an organized assault against rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia who were holding them. Among the Colombians rescued were a media owner and former Bogota football team president, Guillermo Cortes, 73, who was kidnapped in January, and a local businessman, Andres Vargas, said an army spokesman, Francisco Pedraza. The German, an automobile technician, was identified as Rolf Sommerfeld, 57, who is married to a Colombian and has lived here for 18 years.</p>

        <p>PARAGUAY: RACE TOO CLOSE TO CALL  The final result of a vice-presidential election will be withheld almost two weeks because it is close enough to require a manual recount, the national election board announced. The assassination of Vice President Luis Argana early last year necessitated the election. An opposition candidate, Julio Cesar Franco holds a narrow lead over Felix Argana, son of the slain vice president and nominee of the ruling Colorado Party, which has held power for more than 50 years.</p>

        <p>CANADA: INDIAN ROADBLOCK  Micmac Indians blocked New Brunswick's main East Coast road to protest a federal raid that netted 700 unlicensed lobster traps. A group in Miramichi interpreted a Supreme Court ruling last year as allowing 5,200 traps out of season. Rejecting Ottawa's interpretation that no more than 40 traps were to be set, the clan set up a burning roadblock and parked 30 vehicles across Highway 11, a busy tourist road.</p>
