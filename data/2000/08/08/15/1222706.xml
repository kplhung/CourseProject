        <p>Afrim and his family have been on the move through the ruins of their former country for three years now, often living apart, unable to find one place where they can live together safely. Victims of their mixed blood and their own mixed marriage, Afrim and Safeta are each half Albanian and half Serbian from Kosovo, as are their two children, Rina, 13, and Rron, 11.</p>
        <p>Under threat both in Kosovo and in the rest of Serbia, they have found refuge in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, which was itself torn apart in a nationalist war. Her parents are in Croatia; his father is buried in Kosovo's capital and his mother is in Belgrade, Serbia's capital. The family is scattered to the corners of the old Yugoslavia, embodying its official creed of an ethnic harmony they can no longer live out anywhere on its territory.</p>
        <p>''It is an irony to end up here,'' said Afrim, sitting in their rented rooms in a modest house on one of Sarajevo's steep hillsides. ''I would not live here for a long time but, for the moment, it is the best place for us.''</p>
        <p>Weary of their Balkan odyssey, Afrim and Safeta have joined a growing list of families of mixed marriages drifting to Sarajevo to seek help from the United Nations high commissioner for refugees to emigrate. They are hoping to go to Canada, but -- still uncertain of their fate -- they asked that their surname not be published, nor their faces shown in a photograph.</p>
        <p>Both 34, they were high-school sweethearts and married at 19 while still students in the Kosovo capital, Pristina. He studied law and she Yugoslav literature, and they worked together on the student magazine. Afrim began work as a journalist and Safeta as a teacher, just as Kosovo plunged into turbulent years that began when Slobodan Milosevic came to power in Serbia in 1987.</p>
        <p>Mixed marriages -- reasonably common in many parts of the former Yugoslavia, and often complex and bitter after war began in 1991 -- were relatively rare in Kosovo, where Serbs and Albanians had already come to live almost completely separate lives. When such unions did occur, they were usually among the educated elite.</p>
        <p>Afrim's father was Albanian, a lawyer and manager of one of Pristina's banks. After he died in 1991, Afrim's mother, a Serb, was urged by her sons to leave Kosovo. She is now living in Belgrade.</p>
        <p>Afrim and his brother, Agim, 39, grew up bilingual, speaking Albanian with their father and Serbian with their mother. But their looks and name are Albanian. Agim had trained as a doctor but had difficulty finding work in Pristina. And, in 1990, after Serbia stripped Kosovo of its autonomy and then drove many Albanians from their state jobs in the province, Afrim lost his job at Radio TV Pristina. Many Albanians were expelled; others chose to quit their state employment. Afrim, unlike most others, later wanted to return, and was allowed to go back.</p>
        <p>Safeta's Albanian father is a former Yugoslav diplomat, living now with her Serbian mother on the coast of Croatia.</p>
        <p>Safeta grew up speaking only Serbian -- or Serbo-Croat, as the language was then known -- and when asked how she regards her nationality, she calls herself Yugoslav, even though the larger Yugoslavia of her childhood has ceased to exist. Kosovo has become a dangerous place for her because the mere act of speaking Serbian can invite a violent attack.</p>
        <p>In 1998, as ethnic Albanian rebels took up arms against the Serbian security forces, Afrim moved his family to Turkey. ''Knowing what had happened in Bosnia and Croatia,'' he said, referring to the wars of the early 1990's in which parts of the former Yugoslavia became independent countries, ''I knew it would be the same in Kosovo.''</p>
        <p>But Afrim's brother, Agim, was caught in Pristina, and escaped thanks only to some Serbian colleagues at the hospital where he worked. He went to Belgrade and eventually crossed on foot into Bosnia, where Afrim and his family joined him. Together, they began to seek a way out of the Balkans.</p>
        <p>Even as the Kosovo war ended and NATO forces swept into the province, Afrim knew there was no place there for his family.</p>
        <p>''We were already trying to find a third country to go to,'' he said. ''It was obvious what was going to happen in Kosovo,'' he added, referring to the return of Kosovo Albanians who make up the province's majority, and who wanted revenge against the Serbs whose police officers and soldiers had rampaged through the land, killing and expelling Albanians and destroying their villages.</p>
        <p>The family's savings were running out and they went to stay with Safeta's parents in Croatia. But the visa they now need to stay in a country that was once part of their own ran out. They returned to Afrim's mother in Belgrade, where Safeta managed to get a job in a shop.</p>
        <p>But Afrim was arrested three times by the Serbian police. Once he was hauled off a bus, handcuffed and interrogated for 12 hours. Another time the police came for him when he was drinking coffee with his mother in her kitchen. He was told that, like all males from Kosovo, he was forbidden to work in Belgrade.</p>
        <p>So he left the family in Belgrade and went to Kosovo, where he found work at a multiethnic radio station run by the United Nations. He makes light of his situation there, although being half Serbian made it precarious. ''Only once a colleague said I was a traitor,'' he said. Safeta visited and wanted to bring the children, but found all their old neighbors had gone and the neighborhood had changed. ''She was afraid to go out and I was working,'' Afrim said. ''It just wasn't possible.''</p>
        <p>The children at least could go to school in Belgrade and encountered no prejudice from their teachers, Afrim said. Yet they lived with a lurking fear. Rron, a solid, earnest boy who loves computers and drawing, speaks only Serbian in Belgrade and said firmly that he did not care if he never went back to Kosovo.</p>
        <p>Yet in Serbia he seems to fear being discovered as half Albanian. ''My friends think I am a Turk,'' he said proudly. Then he whispered to his father: ''A boy at school said once, 'It's good that you are from Turkey.' He meant that if I was Albanian, he would kill me.''</p>
        <p>Rina, at 13, is more sure of herself. She has the dark striking looks of an Albanian, but her Serbian is fluent and she appears fearless. She preferred her Albanian friends in Kosovo because they were warmer, she said, but she has lots of Serbian friends too. Both children already speak English and say they want to become Canadians.</p>
        <p>Agim has already left for Canada with his Serbian fiancee. Safeta's sister is also preparing to leave with her family. Their main concern is that the children do not have to grow up in a society warped by nationalism.</p>
        <p>''It is for the best, so they do not have to live under the pressure whether they are Albanian, Serbs, Muslims or whatever,'' Afrim said. ''When you live in the Balkans you cannot live without thinking about your background.''</p>
        <p>''It's a collective way of thinking,'' he went on. ''There is no individualism. Maybe we were lucky; because of our mixed marriage, we can see it more clearly. But on the other hand, if you think like that, you cannot live here.''</p>
