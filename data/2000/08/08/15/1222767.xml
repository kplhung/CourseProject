        <p>Representative Loretta Sanchez withdrew today as a featured speaker at the Democratic National Convention, saying that her clash last week with party leaders over her plan to hold a fund-raiser at the Playboy mansion had already focused ''too much press'' on her and the party.</p>

        <p>Representative Loretta Sanchez withdrew today as a featured speaker at the Democratic National Convention, saying that her clash last week with party leaders over her plan to hold a fund-raiser at the Playboy mansion had already focused ''too much press'' on her and the party.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sanchez, who represents the 46th Congressional District of California, just south of Los Angeles, and is a co-chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, reluctantly agreed on Friday to shift the event from the mansion to Universal Studios after convention planners revoked her invitation to address the convention. She was then restored to the list of speakers.</p>
        <p>Party leaders had warned Ms. Sanchez that if an official of her high rank presided over a fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion, the party's efforts to portray itself as the party of ''family values'' rather than the party of sex scandals would be set back immeasurably. She resisted, arguing that the event was already sold out, but eventually gave in when Vice President Al Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, let it be known that they, too, disapproved of the mansion site.</p>
        <p>Convention planners figured that was the end of the matter. But this morning, Ms. Sanchez  surprised them by requesting that her name again be struck from the list of speakers.</p>
        <p>''That was totally unexpected and a big disappointment to all of us,'' said Jennifer Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. ''We had been planning to give her a rousing welcome from the floor, complete with signs and banners. She's one of our rising stars.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sanchez represents a heavily Hispanic district, and her fund-raiser, scheduled for Tuesday, will raise money to be used to get out the increasingly important Hispanic vote.</p>
