        <p>A team from the Rolando Paulino Little League in the Bronx scored two runs in the fifth inning last night in rallying to beat Delaware, 2-1, and advance to today's semifinals of the East Regional Little League tournament in Bristol, Conn.</p>
        <p>The New York team will meet the Pequannock team of New Jersey, which beat D.C., 5-0.</p>
        <p>A single by O'Brien Rivera, followed by Victor Torres's double, ignited the rally by New York, which is 5-1 in the tournament. Rivera scored the tying run on a wild pitch, and Torres scored the second run on a sacrifice fly by Albert Gonzales, son of the Bronx team's coach.</p>
        <p>Juan Almonte, who pitched a perfect game for New York during the round-robin phase of the tournament, went the six-inning distance and allowed five hits while striking out 11.</p>
        <p>Justin Bencsko pitched his second shutout of the tournament in Pequannock's victory over D.C.</p>
        <p>In today's second semifinal, a combined Connecticut team from Lyme and Old Lyme will face either New Hampshire or Rhode Island, whose quarterfinal game was rained out yesterday and rescheduled for this morning. The Connecticut team, which has a 5-1 record, advanced by defeating Massachusetts, 6-1.</p>
        <p>The winners of today's semifinals will meet in the final Thursday night. That champion will move on to the eight-team Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., which runs from next Sunday through the following Saturday.</p>
