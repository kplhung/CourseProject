        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>There's more to ''How Culture Molds Habits of Thought'' (Aug. 8) than appears at first sight.</p>
        <p>Almost 70 years ago, Dr. Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf suggested that how we saw the world was determined by the way our native language shaped our minds.</p>
        <p>The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was contrary to prevailing academic wisdom, and was effectively ignored. Educators and sociologists have long known that culture -- early and not-so-early childhood environment in the broadest sense -- strongly affects development of the cognitive abilities favored by Western culture.</p>
        <p>For better or worse, ''European'' values and modes of thought built today's global economy, and the Internet, which may well define economics and politics far into the future, is dominated by the English language, and American English at that.</p>
        <p>No culture is morally better or worse than any other, but Western language and modes of thought and action have taken the economic trophy and define how business is done.</p>
        <p>The challenge will be to enable members of every culture to adopt economically effective ''Western'' cognitive styles while preserving the values, artistic expression and community that are special to each culture.</p>
