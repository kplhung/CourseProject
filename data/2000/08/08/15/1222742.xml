        <p>When Valhalla Golf Club played host to its first major championship, the weather was hot, but the course received lukewarm reviews. That was in 1996, when Mark Brooks won the P.G.A. Championship by one stroke over Kenny Perry -- two solid players, but hardly legends. Meanwhile, the course was criticized for being too easy, with 46 players finishing under par.</p>
        <p>Four years later, the P.G.A. Championship is back at Valhalla, for the year's final major, which begins Thursday. But this year's tournament has the potential to be far more memorable than the one in 1996.</p>
        <p>Tiger Woods did not play at Valhalla in 1996 when he was still an amateur. Coming off his record-setting victories this year at the United States Open and the British Open, Woods could become the first player to win three consecutive majors since Ben Hogan in 1953. Imagine the galleries Woods will attract this week. Though Woods will not arrive at Valhalla until Tuesday, today's practice rounds were heavily attended, and the crowds will be huge once the tournament begins.</p>
        <p>The Jack Nicklaus-designed course, which opened in 1986, has been lengthened and toughened since 1996, and most players who practiced today said the changes were for the better. A more mature course, a world-class field, enthusiastic galleries and a major championship at stake seemed like reason enough to give Valhalla a second chance. ''It's not one of the traditional courses, and it's not the same style of course we usually play majors on,'' said Jim Furyk, who tied for 17th here in 1996. ''So there's a lot of talk about the course. But I'm excited about the week. It's a major championship. We'd all like to win it.''</p>
        <p>Winning will require accuracy off the tee and precise approach shots into the severely undulating greens. Twelve of the 18 holes have been altered in some way since 1996, with most of the changes on the front nine encouraging players to use their driver more often. The first hole has been lengthened 21 yards to 446 yards, and the fairway was narrowed at the par-5, 533-yard No. 2.</p>
        <p>But, on paper, Valhalla remains a course where length is not a prerequisite for winning. Brooks, who won in 1996, is not among the tour's longest hitters, and the prevailing theory is that Valhalla may not fit Woods as well as Pebble Beach and St. Andrews did this year. But any course fits Woods when he is playing well.</p>
        <p>''The winner will be someone who's making putts, who's handling the greens well,'' said Steve Jones, who won the 1996 United States Open. ''Everyone knows Tiger's the best player. He hits the ball great, but the key to him running away at the U.S. Open was that he made all those putts for par that kept his momentum going. And at St. Andrews, his length was a big factor.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a good course. I would've been thrilled to win any U.S. Open, to win it at Oakland Hills and to have my ugly mug up there next to someone like Ben Hogan only made it more special. But this is a major championship, and whoever wins Sunday will be thrilled.''</p>
        <p>The first three majors of the year were held at three of golf's most treasured venues -- the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club with its unique tradition, the United States Open at Pebble Beach Golf Links with its special beauty, and the British Open at St. Andrews, a historic site known as the home of golf. Valhalla is following some tough acts, but the public is certain to become more familiar with Valhalla in the coming years. The PGA of America, which owns Valhalla, is bringing the P.G.A. Championship back here in 2006, and the Ryder Cup will be played here in 2007.</p>
        <p>The par-4, 470-yard No. 12 is Valhalla's toughest hole, but the par-5, 542-yard No. 18 could provide the best theater. The finishing hole features a three-level green that can be reached in two shots, providing the potential for an eagle finish that could produce a two- or three-shot swing. So with Woods chasing history and the Louisville area ready to embrace golf's biggest stars, another major championship will be held at Valhalla. There was a buzz in the air today, and it was only Monday. And once the tournament begins, the venue will not matter as much to the players as the result.</p>
        <p>''I think everybody's excited to be here, but I hope some guys aren't,'' Furyk said. ''Maybe that might make it easier for me to win.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>STEVE ELKINGTON, winner of the 1995 P.G.A. Championship, withdrew Monday after undergoing hip surgery Friday. The operation repaired a torn labrum and Elkington expects to play again this fall. He was replaced by EDWARD FRYATT.</p>
