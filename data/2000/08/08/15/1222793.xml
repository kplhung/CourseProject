        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is interesting to see how the study of the differences in perception and thought between Eastern and Western subjects reflects those of the researchers as much as those of their subjects (''How Culture Molds Habits of Thought'').</p>
        <p>They stated that it was a long-held assumption that all people approached logical arguments and analyses in the same way.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, they found that this was not the case, which was then declared to be a paradigm shift in cognitive psychology.</p>
        <p>I believe that this is because the psychologists themselves tend toward the Western style of dismissing opinions and viewpoints that they have deemed to be logically weaker, clinging to the notion that their methods of thought are not only correct, but that they are universal.</p>
        <p>Those who are not prone to this habit do not find these results to be as radical as the article implied.</p>
        <p>I do agree, however, with the point that this assumption is a big part of what has been holding back the fields of psychology and philosophy from forming a more complete theory of the human mind.</p>
