        <p>Marisa Acocella is a 30-something cartoonist for The New Yorker, whose subjects  are often those size-zero women you see writhing in their Pradas amid the suburban style-moochers and aging Seventh Avenue designers in the mock-bistro coziness of Pastis. In other words, Ms. Acocella understands fashion even as she reviles it. She understands, for example, that suits are back in fashion, and that many women, possibly even she herself, will want to wear one, but she rejects the conventional reasons -- power, glamour, a sense of security -- being given in the fashion world.</p>
        <p>''If you need a suit to feel powerful,'' Ms. Acocella said, ''I would say, 'Invest in a really good shrink or get a haircut.' ''</p>
        <p>Then she said, ''Remember when AOL bought Time Warner and the AOL guy, Steve---- '' she meant Stephen M. Case, the chief executive -- ''was the one wearing the coat and tie, and not Gerald Levin, the guy you'd expect to look corporate?'' Ms. Acocella was on to something, talking faster: ''It's like reverse radicalism. Everyone's so supercool and living out the Internet lifestyle, making millions, that the idea of putting on a grown-up suit now seems totally radical.'' She paused, reflecting on the image of the curiously suave-looking Mr. Case standing next to the older, disconcertingly tieless Mr. Levin. ''To me, that picture had the greatest impact on fashion this year,'' she said. ''Whether the designers even knew it is hard to say.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Acocella may be overstating the significance of that moment back in January, but she is raising some interesting points. Namely, that for all the ballyhoo about the return of the suit -- and the magazines and department stores are practically frothing at the prospect of coaxing women back into jacket ensembles -- hardly anyone has bothered to really look at the reasons a woman may or may not want to wear a suit this fall. And it's still very much an open question, with millions of dollars in inventory at stake.</p>
        <p>To be sure, in the current issue of Vogue there are 46 pages of suit looks buttressing a long article in which the writer, Robin Givhan, reports that suits ''still occupy a command position in professional wardrobes from New York to San Francisco'' and that among the women she interviewed -- lawyers, homemakers, social overachievers -- there was a consensus that a suit not only made them feel confident and polished but was easier to wear than casual separates.</p>
        <p>Well, all right, the suit lives! But this is a story told by Vogue and its sisters many times before, when the suit was hot and even dead. And discovering that there are still pockets of dedicated suit wearers in this country is a little like going to Atlanta and being surprised to find that, after all this time, amid the high-style boutiques and sprawling suburban elegance, people still eat grits.</p>
        <p>The fact is, this has become a nation of infinite styles and ideals, with no more than a handful of them attracting (or meriting) the attention of the mainstream media at any one time. ''It's a country of 280 million people, and they don't all read Vogue at the same moment,'' said Bud Konheim, the avuncular president of Nicole Miller. ''So there are people out there who are still looking for bell-bottoms.'' And just because suits haven't been on the fashion radar for a few years doesn't mean that someone, somewhere, hasn't been selling or wearing them.</p>
        <p>There's no question that suits, from sexy to ladylike, dominated the runways for fall, but notions of how big the demand will be depend a lot on whom you talk to. Designers like Oscar de la Renta, Bill Blass, Michael Kors and Carolina Herrera have always had a solid suit business, because the lifestyle of their customers doesn't change. Indeed, walk east a few blocks from Mrs. Herrera's snazzy new boutique on Madison Avenue to Swifty's, and on any day its two dining rooms are filled with women in suits.</p>
        <p>Denise Seegal, the president of Liz Claiborne, which is offering 30 percent more jackets in its collection lines, predicted that suits are going to sell very well. And so did Joan Kaner, the fashion director at Neiman Marcus, and Jacqui Lividini, a senior vice president at Saks Fifth Avenue. Even though casual dressing represents a continuing trend, neither sees any obstacle to the return of the suit. ''At Saks, everyone was happy to see the suit back,'' Ms. Lividini said, ''because our customer has always liked it.''</p>
        <p>That customer is also older, from a generation that staked its professionalism on broad, man-tailored shoulders. But what can any of that old business mean to a woman in her 20's who wears a shell and a flippy skirt to work -- where nobody bats an eye? ''I don't know anyone in my industry who wears suits,'' said Liza Burnett, 25, an associate at Dan Klores Associates, a public relations firm in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Indeed, go to the boutiques where young women shop and you get a completely different picture. ''It's expensive to build a suit wardrobe,'' said Stefani Greenfield, an owner of the Scoop boutiques, who devoted just 10 percent of her budget to suits, mainly in sexy styles. ''Girls in their mid-20's buy separates. They like stuff, and they want a lot of it.''</p>
        <p>Beth Shepherd, a co-owner of Kirna Zabete in SoHo, said she bought suits from Hussein Chalayan and Alice Roi, a new designer whose suits have a real edge. But in buying any given designer line, what portion of the budget did she devote to suits?  Ms. Shepherd laughed and said: ''One percent. I mean, we bought suits from Paul Smith last season that are still here.''</p>
        <p>The NPD Group, which gathers apparel data from retailers as well as consumers, predicts that fall suit sales will increase no more than 5 percent -- a modest gain compared with the 13 percent increase for sweaters in 1999. Sales of women's tailored clothes, which also include more casual variations of jackets and pants, have been on the rise since last fall, but Marshal Cohen, a senior NPD analyst, cautioned against calling the suit a trend. He added that if department stores sound overly enthusiastic, it's because their business is concentrated in specific categories.</p>
        <p>''They look at segments, not the world,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''A department manager can point to what is to the rest of us a 1 percent gain and say, 'I'm going to turn a 20 percent increase.' It's trying to make a bigger issue out of a little one.''</p>
        <p>If women decide to buy suits, it will be for one uncomplicated reason. Suits are in fashion. ''I've got to say, I'm burning to buy a pantsuit,'' admitted Tina Skouras, fashion editor of Vanity Fair. Yet for a lot of women like Ms. Skouras, who have their own style and are hardly what anyone would call fashion victims, the reasons for wanting a suit have almost nothing do with the old standards of power and security. ''I think suits are sexy now,'' Ms. Skouras said. ''It's almost as if designers took all the separates we like to wear and found the same proportion in a suit.''</p>
        <p>Julie Gilhart, a vice president of Barneys, agreed, adding that young women may be drawn to the grown-up novelty of suits, but also want the look that purrs with sex appeal. ''And if you're not giving a woman an opportunity to purr every day,'' Ms. Gilhart said, ''then you're looking at a markdown.''</p>
