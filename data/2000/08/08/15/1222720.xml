        <p>The Security Council agreed today to set up a war crimes tribunal for Sierra Leone, where brutal rebel armies have tortured civilians, amputated their hands and destroyed villages to intimidate innocent civilians.</p>
        <p>The measure, passed by a 15-to-0 vote, stopped short, however, of actually establishing the court or deciding its composition and functions. There are some lingering questions about how the authority should be shared between Sierra Leone's judicial system and neutral international legal experts.</p>
        <p>Instead, the council asked Secretary General Kofi Annan to address these and other questions and to produce a detailed blueprint for the court within 30 days. The council had been ready to vote on the court Friday, when the Russians asked at the last minute for more time to study the resolution.</p>
        <p>Richard C. Holbrooke, the American ambassador, said in an interview that the secretary general would be bound by a council consensus that the court has to have international input, even if council members were not all in agreement on details.</p>
        <p>''He does not have the option of saying, 'Put it all under Sierra Leone,' '' Mr. Holbrooke said.</p>
        <p>The ambassador from Sierra Leone to the United Nations, Ibrahim Kamara, called the council's action ''a very, very bold step'' forward for his country.</p>
        <p>The tribunal will be the third created over the last decade of increased civil conflict, following the establishment of war crimes courts for the Balkans and Rwanda. Plans for a fourth court, to try officials of the Khmer Rouge, who were responsible for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians in the 1970's, are in the final stages of negotiation with the Cambodian government.</p>
        <p>The newest tribunal is to try ''crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian law, as well as crimes under relevant Sierra Leone law committed within the territory of Sierra Leone.'' It will draw on precedents, but will at the same time be tailored to Sierra Leone's particular situation, diplomats said today. The country has a democratically elected government, which has asked for international help with the court and is expected to cooperate fully.</p>
        <p>The most prominent prisoner to face the Sierra Leone tribunal is expected to be Foday Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front, who jettisoned a 1999 agreement with the government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and resumed attacks on the army. In May, his forces also captured 500 United Nations peacekeepers. They were all subsequently released, but not without embarrassment to the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sankoh is now in Sierra Leone's custody. Some of the concerns about the composition and functioning of the court rest on the fear that Mr. Sankoh will try again, as he has in the past, to bargain for amnesty if the country's weakened judicial system has control of the tribunal.</p>
        <p>The council called today for a tribunal based on ''impartiality, independence and credibility'' and suggested the possibility that appeals hearings, at least, may have to be held outside Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke said that several important steps have now been taken by the council on Sierra Leone. Last month, the council voted to ban diamond sales from the country until a certification system is put into place by the government. Diamonds have been fueling Mr. Sankoh's war and enriching the president of neighboring Liberia, Charles Taylor.</p>
        <p>Last week, the council voted to strengthen the role of the peacekeeping force, giving it authority to ''take down the R.U.F,'' Mr. Sankoh's rebel army, Mr. Holbrooke said.</p>
        <p>The next move on Sierra Leone will be the expansion of the peacekeeping force, now limited to 13,000 troops. Council members expect Mr. Annan and the peacekeeping department to recommend a number between 19,000 and 25,000. The Clinton administration, usually skittish about approving large peacekeeping operations because of opposition in Congress, is backing the highest number this time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke said that in recent days both Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee for president, and his leading foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, have given public support to a strong bipartisan policy on Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>Some differences over the jurisdiction of the tribunal arose between the United States and Britain, which had taken the lead in responding to the crisis in Sierra Leone. Mr. Holbrooke said that the disputes were ''technical.''</p>
        <p>''We wanted an international umbrella over the court but we didn't want to create a third tribunal because they are very expensive and very slow, and we wanted to move fast,'' he said. ''There was initially some thought among some lawyers in Washington and New York and London that this ought to all be under Sierra Leone law.'' In the end, the council fell somewhere between.</p>
