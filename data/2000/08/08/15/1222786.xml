        <p>Eleanor Randolph Editorial Observer says that Hillary Rodham Clinton was once again doing her dutiful first lady act at Democratic National Convention, performing a downbeat opening routine for her highly oratorical husband; says Mrs Clinton is but a few days away from shedding first lady role and, like Al Gore, moving into territory of the full-time candidate who will have to rely on her own talents and resources more than on borrowed charisma</p>

        <p>The setting for the Clinton rally in Hollywood Sunday afternoon was more reminiscent of the first couple's Arkansas past than their New York future. It was the small-town Main Street created for the Sony Pictures Studio, a place where Hillary Rodham Clinton slipped somewhat too easily into her old supporting role as first lady. After more than a year of establishing her own political identity in New York, with only five months to go in the Clinton presidency, she was once again doing her dutiful first lady act, performing a downbeat opening routine for her highly oratorical husband.</p>

        <p>The setting for the Clinton rally in Hollywood Sunday afternoon was more reminiscent of the first couple's Arkansas past than their New York future. It was the small-town Main Street created for the Sony Pictures Studio, a place where Hillary Rodham Clinton slipped somewhat too easily into her old supporting role as first lady. After more than a year of establishing her own political identity in New York, with only five months to go in the Clinton presidency, she was once again doing her dutiful first lady act, performing a downbeat opening routine for her highly oratorical husband.</p>
        <p>True to form, she gave an earnest, efficient, plain speech to this Hollywood group before turning over the microphone. True to form, he made her look like a novice. Still, when the candidate for the Senate spoke, people listened; as the president spoke, his audience began to slip away at the edges.</p>
        <p>This moment on an ersatz street in the capital of make-believe underscored one real-life, if largely unspoken, truth about the couple that have dominated Democratic consciousness for almost a decade. He has always been the Clinton with the talent to win people over, to dazzle them with empathy, to make the Hollywood crowd envy his glamour and open their checkbooks. But this week in Los Angeles, the party faithful are going through a collective act of realization. At long last, Hillary has one thing he doesn't -- a future.</p>
        <p>''Now comes the time when she has to talk about who she is, what kind of person she is, what she thinks about issues and what she would do as senator,'' says Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers. Like most of Mrs. Clinton's ardent New York supporters, Ms. Weingarten insists that she has full confidence in the first lady's abilities to wow her audiences, to convince them of her solid credentials, her stands on the issues.</p>
        <p>But the reality is that Mrs. Clinton is but a few days away from shedding the first lady role more fully than ever and moving into the territory of the full-time candidate who will have to rely on her own talents and resources more than on borrowed charisma.</p>
        <p>Like Vice President Al Gore, Mrs. Clinton has to move out more solidly on her own, holding onto the economic progress in the last eight years while shedding the sleazier stuff that is clearly a more complicated part of her life than the vice president's.</p>
        <p>Last weekend in Hollywood rubbing shoulders with movie stars and moguls raises money at the same time that it revives the questions about the Clintons' attraction to glitter and old memories of Monica Lewinsky's hometown. Back home in New York, Mrs. Clinton's opponent Rick Lazio was making the connection by holding a press conference at Planet Hollywood in New York City.</p>
        <p>Also like Vice President Gore, Mrs.  Clinton is enjoying the rush of support coming from his choice of Senator Joseph Lieberman as his running mate. A Democratic candidate in New York State usually needs about 70 percent of the Jewish vote. Before the Lieberman choice, only about half of the state's Jewish Democrats were supporting the first lady. ''It's hard to imagine a more helpful choice for her,'' said Victor Kovner, a New York City Democratic Party loyalist who sees the choice as a tie-breaker in this race. ''The Jewish community will come home to their party.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Lieberman may also activate the Orthodox vote that is heavily conservative, Mrs. Clinton seems confident that she will make a net gain from his presence on the New York ballot. All weekend, she has used the Lieberman name like a protective mantra, even letting it be known that she agrees with many of the Connecticut senator's concerns about too much violence in the entertainment fare churned out by her big donors here.</p>
        <p>While paying tribute to her husband and Mr. Gore, the first lady delivered what was essentially her own campaign speech. She has seemed determined to create a new aura of independence in Los Angeles -- not only at the fund-raisers but also in the many media interviews with anchors big-time and small. It was she, for example, who announced the pullback in the first couple's interview schedule when it became clear that their efforts to upstage Mr. Gore were turning into a public-relations disaster.</p>
        <p>Her other appearances here were intended to do more than raise money. She also wanted to make the point that the New York Senate campaign was a contest on issues -- abortion, the economy, gun control -- where she fits more easily with the state's majority than Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>In a way, then, this convention marks Mrs. Clinton's graduation from the campaign-worker phase of her life to the politician phase. That gave a special resonance to the words that she spoke to a worshipful crowd of Democratic women in a jammed ballroom of the Wilshire Grand Hotel. ''We are not going back,'' she said. ''we are not keeping quiet. We are not giving up. We intend to take our rightful place at the table.'' Mr. Clinton was not in the audience, but you have to wonder if he checked the transcript.</p>
