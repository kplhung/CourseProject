        <p>This war-haunted nation's president, blinded in her right eye by a suicide bomber's attack, still talks of peace. But many ordinary Sri Lankans are more convinced than ever that no end to the country's 17-year conflict with the Tamil rebels is near.</p>
        <p>President Chandrika Kumaratunga hoped that a new constitution she proposed on Aug. 3 would preserve Sri Lanka as a unified nation while satisfying the demands of the Tamil minority for greater authority to rule themselves in the north and east, which the Tamils regard as their traditional homelands.</p>
        <p>That effort has collapsed for now, though Mrs. Kumaratunga has vowed to revive it after national elections this fall.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a feeling of menace  hovers over the capital, even though there has been a lull in the fierce battles between the rebel group, known as the Tamil Tigers, and the government in recent months.</p>
        <p>Rumors are rife that the Tigers are gearing up for a surprise attack in the north or east -- and more terrorist bombings in Colombo. Armed sentries dot the cityscape, on the lookout for suicide bombers.</p>
        <p>Members of Parliament from Mrs. Kumaratunga's party were whisked to Parliament in helicopters to avoid feared attacks while the proposed constitution was debated. Streets around it were closed to cars. The only approach was on foot.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of Buddhist monks in saffron robes, who cast themselves as guardians of the nation, hiked to the gates of Parliament to denounce the proposal constitution as a first step toward a division of the country between the majority Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, and the Tamils, who are mostly Hindus.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kumaratunga, head of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, spent months negotiating with the opposition United National Party and came closer than ever before to reaching a consensus with its leaders -- which would have meant a united front of all the major Sinhalese politicians in favor of greater autonomy for the Tamils.</p>
        <p>But just before the constitution was introduced, the opposition party announced that it would oppose it. The party objected to a provision that would allow Mrs. Kumaratunga, who was re-elected president in December, to continue in power until 2005, despite the new constitution's abolition of the executive presidency in favor of a parliamentary system headed by a prime minister.</p>
        <p>''I am sorry for this lady,'' said V. Anandasangaree, senior vice president of the Tamil United Liberation Front, a moderate political party. ''She had moved heaven and earth to find a solution to the problem, but the U.N.P. took her for a ride and then dropped her like a hot potato.''</p>
        <p>But it is not just among the Sinhalese opposition that President Kumaratunga has run into political trouble. Her proposal, written with the hope of winning over the Tamils, has stirred more ambivalence than enthusiasm among Tamil politicians who have risked their lives and the wrath of the Tigers by favoring a political settlement of the conflict.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the Tamil United Liberation Front decided that they could not support the constitution because they felt that Mrs. Kumaratunga had diluted the autonomy provisions too much in her negotiations with the United National Party.</p>
        <p>Their decision was particularly poignant because a member of Parliament from their party, the constitutional scholar Neelan Tiruchelvam, was the chief Tamil architect of earlier drafts -- and was assassinated by a suicide bomber a year ago.</p>
        <p>Still, Mrs. Kumaratunga considers her proposal the best chance for peace. She says it would eventually convince Tamils that the Sinhalese were willing to share power with them, sapping support for the Tigers, whose group's full name is the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.</p>
        <p>''The weapons that the L.T.T.E. fear the most are not the weapons of war,'' she said in an interview on Friday at Temple Trees, the presidential residence. ''The weapon they fear most is peace.''</p>
        <p>But many Sri Lankans have ceased to believe that the Tigers will ever compromise on their demand for the independent homeland they call Eelam, an intransigence that condemns the country to endless warfare.</p>
        <p>''The only thing is to fight until the Tigers surrender,'' said Pradeep Edirisooya, 31, a Sinhalese travel agent.</p>
        <p>While praising the president's new constitution for giving Tamils a better deal, Thirumahal, a Tamil law student who has only one name, said she, too, felt it would not end the war.</p>
        <p>''The Tamils aren't fighting the Sinhalese,'' she said. ''The government is fighting the L.T.T.E. You cannot stop the war. It used to be about ethnicity. Now it's a power struggle.''</p>
        <p>While Sinhalese hard-liners who oppose Mrs. Kumaratunga's plan organized raucous protests, there were few if any spontaneous and emotional demonstrations in favor of it. The constituency for peace was very quiet.</p>
        <p>And her government's frantic efforts to put together a two-thirds majority in Parliament failed. Less than a week after she introduced the plan, she withdrew it rather than face certain defeat.</p>
        <p>Despite the setbacks, Mrs. Kumartunga has not given up. She has a new strategy.</p>
        <p>The six-year term of this Parliament ends on Aug. 24, and national elections must be held by early November. If she is unable to resurrect the constitutional package in the coming week, she said her party's candidates would ask the public for a mandate to pass it with a simple parliamentary majority, rather than the required two-thirds majority.</p>
        <p>''It may go slightly against a clause of the present Constitution,'' she said, ''but it is democratic and legal.''</p>
        <p>If the constitution is adopted in the way she describes, it will inevitably face legal challenges -- and will still require a national referendum for adoption.</p>
        <p>The Tigers, as well as the hard-liners among the Sinhalese, are likely to do all they can to make sure that she does not succeed. And many here question whether the proposed constitution would bring the country closer to peace in any case.</p>
        <p>Though it would give the government sweeping powers to crush any secessionist movement and enshrine Buddhism in ''the foremost place,'' the monks who protested at the gates of Parliament denounced it is a betrayal of the nation.</p>
        <p>A raucous cheer of victory rose from a throng of holy men when a priest announced that the government had withdrawn its peace plan.</p>
        <p>''She wants to give a certain part of this country to Tiger terrorists and stay in power all her life,'' said M. Ananda, one of the monks. ''That's her ulterior motive. She has not revealed the secret to the people of this country.''</p>
