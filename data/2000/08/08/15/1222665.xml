        <p>''Who of us would not be glad to lift the veil behind which the future lies hidden; to cast a glance at the next advances of our science and at the secrets of its development during future centuries?''</p>
        <p>One hundred years ago, with those inviting thoughts, the German mathematician David Hilbert opened his landmark address to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, laying out 23 of the great unsolved problems of the day. ''For the close of a great epoch,'' Hilbert declared, ''not only invites us to look back into the past but also directs our thoughts to the unknown future.''</p>
        <p>With another century ending -- a whole millennium in fact -- the pressure is all the greater to tabulate human ignorance with lists of the most enticing cosmic mysteries.</p>
        <p>In May, the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Mass., emulated Hilbert, announcing (in Paris, for full effect) seven ''Millennium Prize Problems,'' each with a bounty of $1 million.</p>
