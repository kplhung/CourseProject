        <p>Elena Lazzaro and her husband were the first to build a home on their block of River Road, on the banks of the Musconetcong River, 37 years ago.</p>
        <p>Today, Mrs. Lazzaro was one of the last in her now well-developed neighborhood to pack up a few precious belongings and abandon her home, after police and fire officials went through the neighborhood with bullhorns, warning residents that the river waters were continuing to rise two days after a relentless storm flooded Byram Township and many other towns in northwestern New Jersey, dropping 14 inches of rain in some areas.</p>
        <p>''I used to put a chair out here and sit and watch the river,'' said Mrs. Lazzaro, who has been a widow for two years. The river, once ankle deep, was a raging torrent today, about six feet deep, and was beginning to engulf her property.</p>
        <p>''The lakes and the rivers are what make this area so beautiful,'' said Mrs. Lazzaro, standing in the steady drizzle. ''But I guess it's also what's making it so dangerous now.''</p>
        <p>Even as some families were allowed to return to their homes today after Saturday's storm, rescue officials evacuated about 300 more families from Byram Township, Sparta and other nearby towns, including a day camp here with 800 children, because about six dams in the complex regional system of waterways had given way, swelling rivers and streams that crisscross the lush terrain.</p>
        <p>A storm that dropped four more inches of rain today, and the forecast of more showers for Tuesday, cast a broad swath of northwestern New Jersey into soggy despair, almost a year after Tropical Storm Floyd struck central New Jersey and left record-setting flooding in its wake.</p>
        <p>Today, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman put Morris and Sussex Counties under a state of emergency, allowing the state to order evacuations and activate New Jersey National Guard units. Parts of Warren County were also inundated.</p>
        <p>The state has asked for the affected areas to be designated federal disaster areas, which would make homeowners eligible for aid. The governor said that designation was important because the state's disaster fund has been depleted since last fall's tropical storm.</p>
        <p>''At this point there's not a lot of state money available,'' she said, ''because we're still providing money for victims of Hurricane Floyd.''</p>
        <p>No serious injuries have been reported since Saturday's downpour, although the torrents damaged hundreds of homes, destroyed water mains in Newton and collapsed dozens of bridges, roads and dams.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Trenton this morning, Mrs. Whitman, who toured the flooded areas by helicopter and on the ground, said the worst damage was confined to a relatively small area. ''The fascinating thing about it,'' she said, ''is how really concentrated it was. You're up there and you have one town that got 14.2 inches of rain, and Andover, the next town over, got an inch and a half.''</p>
        <p>But she said the hard-hit areas were reeling.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that there are lots of businesses that have been impacted,'' she said. ''Some homes were shifted off of their foundations by the pressure of rocks, logs and mud up against them.''</p>
        <p>State officials estimated that the storm caused $160 million worth of damage, but said it was too early for a final tally.</p>
        <p>''Until the waters recede in all those lakes and rivers, we won't know the full extent of what we're dealing with,'' said Eskil (Skip) Danielson, emergency management coordinator for Sussex County.</p>
        <p>Many people had tales of near-misses with the fast-moving waters.</p>
        <p>Maria Vogel-Short, who lives with her husband near Lake Hopatcong in a house that was a summer home for his family for 44 years, said they called 911 on Saturday to ask for help when the lake waters were lapping at their home and threatening to topple their propane tanks.</p>
        <p>''They told us that they had too many calls and they couldn't come and help unless someone was dying,'' Ms. Vogel-Short said.</p>
        <p>She said a neighbor's rock wall was directing the flood waters into her yard. When that neighbor would not allow the wall to be breached, other neighbors helped dig a trench to divert the water, and then built a stone barrier around the house and tanks.</p>
        <p>''It was like we were colonists or settlers,'' Ms. Vogel-Short said. ''We dug with our bare hands.'' She wound up with four feet of water in the basement and, like many of her neighbors, had no flood insurance to pay for the cleanup. ''We were afraid we were going to lose our homes.''</p>
        <p>Among those evacuated today were 800 children at the Jefferson Lake day camp on Waterloo Road here. Officials said they feared that eroding dams would cause the Musconetcong River to overflow. The river, which flows out of Sussex County and borders Morris, Hunterdon and Warren Counties, was rising a foot an hour today, and crested in midafternoon.</p>
        <p>When emergency workers ordered everyone in the area to leave, camp officials quickly arranged to have the children bused to a middle school near the Byram Township municipal building. Late in the afternoon, with military precision, camp counselors and directors were getting the children, who did not seem the worse for wear, back on buses to return them home.</p>
        <p>''We weren't flooded,'' said Ira Fish, the owner of the camp. ''The problem was the road nearby. If that had flooded, we'd have had to sleep everybody at the camp. We've been here 43 years, and this has never happened before.''</p>
        <p>In some parts of the region, residents were returning to their homes today. Ron Earl, 66, stood on his son Randy's property on Glen View Avenue in Sparta, still staring in disbelief at the way the storm had scraped the property like a giant bulldozer, erasing its well-tended lawns, two fish-stocked ponds and a gazebo. What remained was a muddy field, with huge trees upturned, and remnants of a stone wall that Randy and his grandfather had built over several decades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Earl, who was the football coach at Sparta High School until he retired a few years ago, said that in the late afternoon on Saturday, it appeared that the flood waters would overtake his son's house. But before that happened, falling trees created a sort of dam, diverting the waters.</p>
        <p>''They'll never be able to rebuild it to the way it was,'' said Mr. Earl, who lives across the street from his son and spent the weekend hauling debris, worrying about how far the river would rise and marveling at flooding he had never before seen.</p>
        <p>''People don't realize the power of water,'' he said.</p>
