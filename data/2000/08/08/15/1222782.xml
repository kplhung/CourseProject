        <p>M&amp; M/Mars, part of Mars Inc., said yesterday that it was reintroducing the TWIX Peanut Butter brand, bringing it back after three years. Shipments to retailers will begin this month.</p>
        <p>''We've had so many consumer calls saying they want peanut butter back,'' said Michelle Weese, a spokeswoman for M&amp; M/Mars in Hackettstown, N.J.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, ''we realized we had too many varieties out and it diluted the line,'' Ms. Weese added, ''so what we wanted to do was regain focus, so we pared it down back to the original which was caramel.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Weese said the reintroduction would be accompanied by a television and radio campaign created by Grey Worldwide in New York, part of the Grey Global Group, starting in November.</p>
