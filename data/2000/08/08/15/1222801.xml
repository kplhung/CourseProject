        <p>IN January 1994, when the Confederate flag issue was beginning to percolate, a group of about 20 sportswriters covering Super Bowl XXVIII in Atlanta decided to be part of a solution, not the problem. We planned an impromptu, low-key demonstration to protest the presence of the Confederate flag outside the Georgia Dome. There was something irksome about having to walk back and forth with those stars and bars waving overhead.</p>
        <p>Our presence seemed like tacit acceptance of the symbolism: oppression, sedition, nullification.</p>

        <p>IN January 1994, when the Confederate flag issue was beginning to percolate, a group of about 20 sportswriters covering Super Bowl XXVIII in Atlanta decided to be part of a solution, not the problem. We planned an impromptu, low-key demonstration to protest the presence of the Confederate flag outside the Georgia Dome. There was something irksome about having to walk back and forth with those stars and bars waving overhead.</p>
        <p>Our presence seemed like tacit acceptance of the symbolism: oppression, sedition, nullification.</p>
        <p>When the color guard marched out for the national anthem, the group -- men, women, blacks, whites, Jews and gentiles -- left the press area and stood in a corridor. No words were spoken; the group listened intently to the anthem. When the final note ended, everyone returned to the seats and began working. And that was that. So we thought.</p>
        <p>Nearly seven years later, the Confederate flag issue has moved squarely back into the sports arena. Last week, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference asked the National Collegiate Athletic Association to remove the 2002 men's basketball Final Four and the 2003 women's Final Four from Atlanta if the state does not remove the Confederate emblem from its flag. The S.C.L.C. said that if the flag was not redesigned by March 2001, it would call for a boycott of the events.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, the N.C.A.A. executive committee said it would consider the request and in another matter voted to play first- and second-round men's basketball tournament games in 2002 in South Carolina, the scene of a hard-nosed, bare-knuckle fight over the Confederate flag.</p>
        <p>Charles Wethington, the executive committee chairman and president of the University of Kentucky, said the committee would monitor each situation.</p>
        <p>The committee's vote last week ran counter to a resolution drawn up during the past season by the National Association of Basketball Coaches calling for first- and second-round games to not be played in South Carolina unless the  Confederate flag was removed from the Statehouse grounds. ''I wanted to take it down and put it in a damned museum,'' John Chaney, the Temple head coach, said yesterday. ''The N.C.A.A. seems to care more about the money.''</p>
        <p>The money is substantial: $50 million in lost revenue for Atlanta for the men's Final Four and $25 million for the women's.</p>
        <p>What would happen, Chaney was asked, if Temple reached the Final Four in 2002?</p>
        <p>''If the issue is not resolved, if people like the N.A.A.C.P. are still fighting, damn right: I'd hold hands with them,'' he said. ''It would be difficult to tell the team not to go, but I can tell my team why I'm not going.''</p>
        <p>Chaney wants a fight. The battle needs new young blood. The fight needs students and student athletes.</p>
        <p>''If college and professional athletes were in lock step, that flag would come down immediately,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Chaney thinks that is pretty unlikely. So much prosperity. So many doing well.</p>
        <p>''Our bellies are full,'' he said. ''We're not willing to back off. We're not willing to lose a few dollars to accomplish a greater goal. People are serving money now.''</p>
        <p>As for players joining the protest? ''Kids are very selfish,'' he said. ''They're only loyal to themselves.''</p>
        <p>Chaney called for athletes to adopt the salmon instinct. ''Salmon is the only species that swims upstream,'' he said. ''We need some people with guts, with the courage to swim upstream, swim against the tide. Racism and bigotry are here, worse than ever. The only ones who see it are old people, and it's hard for us to get off the mark.''</p>
        <p>Cedric Dempsey, president of the N.C.A.A., agrees with Chaney that racism is still prevalent. He is not certain of the role the N.C.A.A. should play, or could play, to fight racism.</p>
        <p>''We had very long discussions about this,'' Dempsey said in an interview yesterday. ''What is our role and are we putting the student athlete in hostile environments?''</p>
        <p>''In South Carolina, the state did what we asked,'' he said in a reference to removal of the flag from atop the state Capitol.</p>
        <p>''We didn't think it was right to ask for one thing where that demand was met to then say, 'No, well now we want this,' '' he added, commenting on the fact that there is now objection to the flag being on the Capitol grounds.</p>
        <p>The flags are flying, the games will go on, the coffers will be filled. But that flag is still the evidence of things unseen.</p>
