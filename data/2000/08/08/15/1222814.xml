        <p>New York State will hold three meetings for officials who hope to have economically troubled areas of their municipalities designated as economic development zones, in which the state provides financial incentives to businesses that move to or expand in the areas.</p>
        <p>Last month, Gov. George E. Pataki signed legislation authorizing the creation of six such zones, which would be added to the 52 already designated from Brooklyn to Buffalo. State officials say that at least 125,000 people have been employed at more than 2,600 businesses helped by the Empire Zones Program, which provides substantial state tax credits and other aid to businesses that invest in the areas. The meetings are to be held on Thursday at the Empire State Plaza in Albany; on Monday at the agency's offices at 633 Third Avenue in Manhattan; and on Aug. 24 at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester.</p>
