        <p>''Why do you want to interview me?'' Todd Helton asked. ''I'm not that interesting of a person.''</p>
        <p>Well, came the reply, you're establishing yourself as one of the best players in baseball. You've led the National League in hitting for nearly the entire season -- sometimes flirting with the .400 mark -- in only your third full season in the big leagues. You're leading the league in hits and runs scored, you are among the leaders in runs batted in and you batted .315 and .320 in your first two years with the Colorado Rockies -- and most people still have no idea who you are or where you came from.</p>
        <p>Also, you took your wife to a baseball fantasy camp on your honeymoon.</p>

        <p>''Why do you want to interview me?'' Todd Helton asked. ''I'm not that interesting of a person.''</p>
        <p>Well, came the reply, you're establishing yourself as one of the best players in baseball. You've led the National League in hitting for nearly the entire season -- sometimes flirting with the .400 mark -- in only your third full season in the big leagues. You're leading the league in hits and runs scored, you are among the leaders in runs batted in and you batted .315 and .320 in your first two years with the Colorado Rockies -- and most people still have no idea who you are or where you came from.</p>
        <p>Also, you took your wife to a baseball fantasy camp on your honeymoon.</p>
        <p>''On that,'' he explained. ''I made a deal with Kristi. She wanted to go to the Windward Islands in the Caribbean on our honeymoon. I said O.K., but after the season.''</p>
        <p>Helton, who turns 27 on Sunday, has a boyish face and a short haircut reminiscent of a college student, but he is big and strong -- 6 feet 2 inches, 205 pounds -- and there is an unmistakable intensity in his eyes.</p>
        <p>He may also be more interesting than he lets on.</p>
        <p>''He works his tail off,'' his manager, Buddy Bell, said. ''Never satisfied. And he doesn't take himself too seriously.''</p>
        <p>Not anymore, perhaps. ''When I first came up to the majors and I'd have a bad day, I'd punish myself,'' Helton said. ''I would do something like not eat dinner. Now I've come to appreciate that we play 162 games a year, and you're going to have bad days. And not eating dinner hurts, doesn't help.''</p>
        <p>Last night was not one of those games. Helton was 3 for 5 with two homers, one of them a go-ahead two-run shot in the ninth inning of a 4-3 victory in Montreal.</p>
        <p>Helton, a first baseman whose .394 average leads the major leagues, is understated in many ways, though with some wild and wacky yearnings. He wears No. 17, as a tribute to Mark Grace, the Cubs first baseman and emphatic free spirit.</p>
        <p>''I like the way Gracie plays,'' Helton said. ''All-out, and with a full-range game. I also wish I could be like him and not wear batting gloves, like the old-timers. But I get a better grip with gloves. And I'd shave my head like he does, if my ears weren't so big.''</p>
        <p>Both Grace and Helton bat and throw left-handed. Each is an All-Star, Grace three times in his 13-year career, Helton for the first time this season. When the two players found themselves together at first base in a recent game, Helton told Grace why he wore No. 17.</p>
        <p>''I was flattered,'' Grace said, ''but Todd is going to be a whole lot better player than I ever was. He's got a great talent and has a great attitude. He's not like a lot of guys today. When he hits a home run, he doesn't dance around the bases.''</p>
        <p>Don Baylor, the Cubs' manager, who was the Rockies' manager when Helton came up to the big leagues, said there is more to Helton's game than what appears in the batter's box, or in the box score.</p>
        <p>''A lot of young guys coming up now just think, 'Offense, offense, offense,' '' Baylor said. ''But Todd works at every aspect of the game, to try to be a complete player. He's not a speedy base runner, but he's a smart base runner. And in the field, he's excellent. He's one of the best at coming in on bunts.''</p>
        <p>Clint Hurdle, the Rockies' batting coach, said Helton was so good at coming in on bunts that he could change the complexion of the game.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes teams don't bunt in bunt situations because of Todd,'' Hurdle said. ''The best I've ever seen at turning a decent bunt into a double play was Keith Hernandez. And Todd is as good, I think, or better.''</p>
        <p>Helton seems surprised at the compliments for that aspect of his game. ''Defense is part of the game, isn't it?'' he said.</p>
        <p>But it is hard work, right? ''Tarring a highway in 90-degree heat is hard work,'' he said. ''Playing baseball is not work.''</p>
        <p>Baylor wonders if Helton's experience as a quarterback at Tennessee has helped his ability to field the bunt and throw in one motion to second or third base.</p>
        <p>''I doubt it,'' Helton said. ''You have to remember, I wasn't a very good quarterback.'' He started four games for the Vols in his junior year, but he injured his knee and was replaced by a freshman named Peyton Manning.</p>
        <p>''It was watching Manning that I realized in a hurry that football was not in my future,'' he said. ''It was baseball I'd better stick with.''</p>
        <p>While baseball fans around the country are just beginning to recognize Helton's ability, baseball scouts have known about him for a long time. Helton, whose father, Jerry, was a minor league catcher in the Twins organization, was born and raised in Knoxville, Tenn. He was a pitcher and first baseman at the University of Tennessee, leading his team to the College World Series in 1995. He was named Baseball America's College Player of the Year.</p>
        <p>The Rockies selected him in the first round of the 1995 draft, the eighth pick over all, and three seasons later he replaced the veteran first baseman Andres Galarraga when he signed as a free agent with Atlanta. Helton was a close second to Kerry Wood for National League Rookie of the Year in 1998.</p>
        <p>Despite his skills in the field and on the bases, it is Helton's hitting that has most set him apart.</p>
        <p>Hurdle told Helton last season that the best hitters maintain their concentration by never taking their eyes off the pitcher. Helton has taken the advice a few steps farther. He comes out of the dugout swinging two bats, and moves close enough to the plate -- about halfway between the on-deck circle and the batter's box -- that a pitcher might wonder if he was suffering double vision, with two batters challenging him.</p>
        <p>Once at the plate, Helton stands in the batter's box in a relatively straight-up stance, as though getting a chest X-ray. His bat is held high, considerably above his left ear, and he appears ready to beat off not just a slider, but a snake as well.</p>
        <p>His bat is an unusual reddish color, seemingly reminding the pitcher that he is in for a serious if not bloodcurdling undertaking. When the pitch is on the way, Helton raises his right leg higher than most, as if stepping over a puddle, and then swings with such fluidity that one may be excused to compare it to music. The next sound is often a bang, like from a drum.</p>
        <p>''It is such a flat-out sweet swing,'' Hurdle said. ''I'm reminded of Don Mattingly or George Brett.''</p>
        <p>Helton said he knew people were impressed with the grace of his swing. ''But I don't see it,'' he said. ''I watch films and think: 'That could be better. It wasn't as pretty as it felt.' And I watch films of Brett, and think, 'Now that's a beautiful swing.' ''</p>
        <p>Not only does Helton hit for average, he hits for power. He hit 25 home runs in his first year with the Rockies and 35 the next. He has 29 this season, along with 101 runs batted in.</p>
        <p>Helton is the cleanup hitter, and thus not expected to bunt. Many young players are not adept at bunting, and don't try. Can Helton bunt?</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' said Bell, his manager, ''and we aren't going to find out.'' The implication was clear. Helton's function is to batter the ball.</p>
        <p>In the very next game after Bell's remark, Helton was leading off the top of the ninth inning in Wrigley Field, with the Rockies trailing Chicago, 2-0. Seeing third baseman Willie Greene playing deep, Helton tried to bunt for a hit. He had the fundamentals right, but the ball rolled foul. He flied out on the next pitch.</p>
        <p>''It was my idea to bunt -- it didn't come from the manager,'' Helton said later. ''For a shot to win, we needed a base runner. A home run wasn't going to win the game.''</p>
        <p>Bell approved. It was that kind of attitude -- ''maturity beyond his years'' -- that Bell had talked about, when a player was not looking to beef up his stats, but to aid the team.</p>
        <p>Helton is a different player than he was when he first came up. Some of it has to do with Hurdle's advice, some of it has to do with his own ability to live and learn, and labor.</p>
        <p>''I watch a lot of film, keep a diary of pitchers and pitches, and come out early to take batting practice,'' he said. ''The more you do it, the more confidence you get. It's an old story, but you really have to believe in yourself, believe you can do it.''</p>
        <p>Helton said that when he first came up, he lacked confidence in late-game situations. ''When I'd be facing a closer, someone who I knew threw really hard, I'd think, 'I'm not going to hit this guy,' '' he said. ''But I knew my attitude had to change. And slowly it did. Now I go up thinking, 'You'd better not throw a strike.' Except for Robb Nen. Can't do a thing against him.''</p>
        <p>He was also very aggressive in his first year, to his detriment, once even jumping to hit a pitch that was over his head. ''You could fool him and get him out with changeups,'' said Kevin Tapani, the Cubs pitcher. ''No more. Now, you just hope he hits the ball at somebody.''</p>
        <p>When Helton arrived as a freshman at Tennessee, he thought about majoring in veterinary medicine.</p>
        <p>''But in my first day in chemistry class, I knew this was going to be too time consuming if I was going to play two sports,'' he said. ''So I switched very quickly to business management.''</p>
        <p>Science was not a complete loss for him. In biology lab, he shared a microscope with another freshman, Kristi Bollman.</p>
        <p>''We met looking into a lens together at dissected frogs,'' Helton said.</p>
        <p>They were married last Jan. 29, Helton said, and he had committed to be an instructor in the Rockies' fantasy camp in Tucson. Spring training was right around the corner, he said, and he had worked so hard in the off-season to prepare that he did not want to let it all go to waste.</p>
        <p>Did it bother him that his wife might have had a different fantasy for their honeymoon?</p>
        <p>''She's understanding,'' he said, with a hint of the hopeful. ''She's learning what it is to be a baseball wife.''</p>
        <p>And he has been learning what it is to be a baseball player -- a better and better one, that is. On that, surely, Mr. and Mrs. Helton would agree.</p>
