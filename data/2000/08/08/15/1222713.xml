        <p>The folks back in Texarkana, Tex., should be proud of Marjorie Scardino. True to her Lone Star State roots, Mrs. Scardino, the chief executive of Pearson P.L.C., thinks big.</p>
        <p>Since January 1997, when she took charge of Pearson -- a British publisher whose holdings include Penguin Books, The Economist magazine, The Financial Times newspaper and a major educational publishing operation -- Mrs. Scardino has overhauled the formerly sleepy company, engineering numerous major acquisitions and asset sales as well as many smaller deals.</p>
        <p>The result, Mrs. Scardino contends, is a media company poised for growth by extending its books, newspapers and magazines into online, interactive communications. But the dizzying pace of change has made it difficult for even some sophisticated financial analysts to gauge the impact of the makeover.</p>
        <p>''Analyzing how the existing businesses are performing is very difficult, which makes it tough to evaluate management,'' said Michael Nathanson, a publishing industry analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>So far, investors in Britain seem to love Mrs. Scardino's attempt to propel a stodgy company into the new economy.  Since she took the reins, the stock, which trades on the London Stock Exchange, has nearly tripled the performance of Britain's main index, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100.</p>
        <p>''There is a Marjorie factor,'' one analyst said. ''They think she can do magic.''</p>
        <p>And the company is so confident of investor support that Pearson has secured a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, where its shares will begin trading in September.</p>
        <p>Just last month Mrs. Scardino announced Pearson's purchase of National Computer Systems, based in Minneapolis, for $2.5 billion in cash. The purchase is meant to let Pearson expand its electronic educational business to include testing services and the connection of schools to homes.</p>
        <p>Pearson is raising the money for the deal through a rights offering that creates roughly 25 percent more shares -- a move that worried some investors because the shares were sold at below-market prices. Nonetheless, investors and analysts generally supported the deal. And despite some concerns that Pearson was making yet another high-priced acquisition,  analysts generally found it a good strategic fit.</p>
        <p>''We really think education will change, and technology has given people the way to change it,'' an enthusiastic Mrs. Scardino said in a telephone interview last week. ''It gives us the way to integrate the assessment portion of education in our school programs.''</p>
        <p>Worthy as the deal may be, though, it goes on a Pearson plate already heaped with acquisitions still waiting to be digested -- including the educational book division of Simon &amp; Schuster, which Pearson bought for $4.6 billion in 1998.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Scardino has, meanwhile, been unflinching in selling high-profile, but peripheral, operations, like the group that owns Madame Tussaud's wax museum, Pearson's stake in various Lazard Freres investment arms, and its holdings in the BSkyB satellite broadcasting business. But at some point, analysts say, Pearson's chief will need to demonstrate her ability to manage the company she has recast in her image.</p>
        <p>Michael Picker, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, wrote last week in a report that recommended holding, but not buying, the stock that ''management is increasingly important, as publishers attempt to shift from a preservation focus to a growth focus.''</p>
        <p>Evaluating management skills is particularly difficult at a company that is undergoing change at such lightning speed. Even a key measurement -- profits or losses from continuing operations -- tends to be a floating figure on such a fluid ledger.</p>
        <p>Profits and losses generated by one-time transactions have accounted for an unusually large -- and varying -- chunk of operating profit before taxes. In 1998, for example, the company reported $:250 million, or $376.2 million, in operating profits. That represented 37.4 percent of profits before taxes and interest. Last year, it posted $:318 million in operating profits, which accounted for about 50 percent of the $:627 million in profits before taxes and interest. The balance was asset sales that included $:348 million from the sale of Pearson's stake in the BSkyB satellite broadcasting business.</p>
        <p>This year, analysts' estimates vary, but a new Morgan Stanley report projects Pearson's profits from continuing operations at $:357 million, or 62 percent of profits before restructuring charges and interest.</p>
        <p>To reduce it all to the simplest numbers: net per-share earnings rose from 6 pence in 1997 to 74.1 pence in 1998 and fell back to 48.2 pence last year.</p>
        <p>''A company whose financials change so dramatically with acquisitions and sales, as evidenced by the huge percentage of profits generated by transactions, makes it impossible with any certainty to see what is happening to the performance of the underlying operations,'' said Bruce Greenwald, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia University's business school. ''That issue is crucial to the future because acquisition activity only makes sense if supported by strong operating abilities.''</p>
        <p>In any acquisition, a buyer has some flexibility about writing down costs in the year of the purchase.  With publishing companies, for example, those costs may include a portion of the expenses of creating educational reading programs, paying writers' advances and carrying  inventory. Depending on how the numbers are recorded, future profit projections can look better than they might have otherwise.</p>
        <p>Pearson's publishing operations represented 52 percent of its $5.37 billion in 1999 sales. But while the company provided pro forma comparisons for sales between 1998 and 1999, to reflect the acquisitions, it did not provide pro forma numbers for 1998 operating profits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nathanson of Bernstein expressed his frustration over this issue in a recent report. ''Pro forma historical comparisons are difficult to make, to say the least,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Even some bottom-line estimates are particularly complex. For example, Pearson releases three different per-share earnings figures -- earnings per equity share, earnings after removing one-time charges but before Internet investments, and earnings per share after one-time charges and after Internet investments.</p>
        <p>A Pearson spokesman, John Phallon, contends that such numbers illuminate, rather than obscure, its financial performance because they distinguish performance before and after acquisitions. Still, Mr. Nathanson and a second analyst who insisted on anonymity said that separating out Internet spending implied that Pearson wanted outsiders to view it is a mere extra. ''The reality is that Internet spending is not an option,'' Mr. Nathanson said. ''It is a necessity, given their businesses.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Phallon added that the company also provided ''underlying sales growth, trading margins'' and other measures to help investors. And he said that providing 1998 pro forma figures for the Simon &amp; Schuster unit would have been difficult since its former owner, Viacom, treated costs in a different way than Pearson. Still, Mr. Nathanson said those comparisons would have been helpful.</p>
        <p>Several other analysts said they too found the numbers exceedingly complex. But they said they were leery of being critical for fear that Pearson could make access more difficult. Mr. Phallon contends he has found no difficulty among analysts ''in understanding how we present our financial results.''</p>
        <p>Some deals, experts acknowledged, have been extremely clever.  Mr. Nathanson cited Pearson's television programming units, which were worth about $1.5 billion before Mrs. Scardino formed an alliance with Bertlesmann and CLT-UFA, the big European broadcaster, to create Audiofina. Pearson's 22 percent of Audiofina currently has a market value of $4.84 billion.</p>
        <p>And yet, the premium prices paid for some recent acquisitions have put extra pressure on Pearson's management to make them pay off. Pearson paid $466 million, or about 1.6 times annual sales, for the small children's book publisher Dorling Kindersly -- a high multiple by traditional standards, according to industry executives. The price for National Computer Systems was 50 times annual profits, which analysts have also generally characterized as top dollar.</p>
        <p>And while Pearson's expansions may bring many advantages, size alone is not magical. Even after combining Pearson's existing educational businesses with the Simon &amp; Schuster unit, the company has had mixed results in persuading schools to use its books. Though Pearson has done well in California, for example, its performance in Texas has been mediocre.</p>
        <p>Peter Jovanovich, president of Pearson Publishing, said he was pleased that educational sales were up 15 percent, but added, ''I wish we had done better in Texas.''</p>
        <p>And not all publishing experts are impressed by Pearson's heavy investment in the education market. ''Why couldn't Pearson have done a joint venture with N.C.S.,'' one industry expert said of the National Computer deal. ''Why did they need to buy it?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jovanovich said that National Computing's software programs for helping parents and teachers assess students' classroom performance could be complementary to Pearson's textbook business and online testing operations.</p>
        <p>And while Pearson says that it can find $50 million in cost savings by combining with National Computer,  gaining additional revenues could be a far trickier route to increased profitability. To one expert in the educational technology field, the issue will be getting two different cultures to work together.</p>
        <p>''Creating educational content is different from building and testing administrative software for the schools,'' this person said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid riling Pearson in a field in which the company holds increasing power. ''The question is whether they can integrate the educational experience and combine it with the assessment business.''</p>
        <p>Pearson itself had initially considered only an alliance with National Computer and had even discussed that possibility with the company.  But when National Computer's chairman, Russ Gullotti, said he was going to retire, he approached Mr. Jovanovich about assuming his position. Mrs. Scardino -- always on the lookout for a deal -- chose to buy the company, perhaps, in part, because she was concerned about losing Mr. Jovanovich.</p>
        <p>Now, while Mr. Jovanovich and other Pearson managers toil to incorporate this latest acquisition, investors and analysts will have their work cut out for them, too -- trying to get a fix on Mrs. Scardino's ever-changing company.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 22, 2000, Tuesday  An article in Business Day on Aug. 15 about business deals by Pearson P.L.C. of Britain misstated the title of an executive and the unit he runs. Peter Jovanovich is chief executive of Pearson Education, not president of Pearson Publishing. The article also misspelled the name of a Pearson spokesman. He is John Fallon, not Phallon.</p>
        <p>The article also referred imprecisely to the reporting of Pearson's financial results. The company's financial statements include one-time gains and losses in profit before taxes and interest, not in operating profit.</p>
