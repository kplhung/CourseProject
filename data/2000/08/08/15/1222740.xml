        <p>The Russian Orthodox Church today announced the canonization of Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, and his immediate family for their ''humbleness, patience and meekness'' when they were imprisoned and executed by the Bolsheviks 82 years ago.</p>
        <p>The elevation of the last czar to sainthood has long been demanded by powerful right-wing factions in the church and had been the subject of considerable debate and controversy. Revered as a martyr and victim of Bolshevism by monarchists and conservatives, Nicholas is also blamed by many Russians for inept, inflexible and harsh rule that only hastened revolution.</p>
        <p>The decision to canonize him, which had been anticipated for several weeks, was made behind closed doors by Patriarch Aleksy II and the church's 150 hierarchs, sitting as the Council of Bishops.</p>
        <p>Reflecting the intense debate preceding the canonization, the bishops did not proclaim the Romanovs as ''martyrs,'' or those who died specifically for their Christian convictions, but instead declared them ''passion bearers,'' a category used to identify believers who, in imitation of Christ, endured suffering and death at the hands of political enemies.</p>
        <p>''In the last Russian Orthodox monarch and in the members of his family we see people who sincerely  sought to live by the commandments of the Gospels,'' reads the council's decision in a statement distributed by the church press service.</p>
        <p>The bishops also canonized 860 others who were killed by the Bolsheviks, many of them priests and monks, as martyrs and ''confessors of the faith.''</p>
        <p>The church's press service said: ''The council has sanctified as passion bearers among the throng of new martyrs and confessors of the faith, the Russian Emperor Nicholas II, Empress Alexandra, Czarevitch Aleksei, Princesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.''</p>
        <p>The formal services will take place Sunday at the Church of Christ the Savior, an imposing cathedral near the Kremlin that was rebuilt in recent years on the site of a church destroyed on Stalin's orders in 1931.  Two years ago, remains identified as those of Nicholas, his wife and three of their children, along with four servants killed with them, were buried in St. Petersburg.</p>
        <p>The remains were exhumed from a forest grave outside Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains in 1991 and identified after DNA testing. The remains of two other children were never found.</p>
        <p>The Russian church has not recognized these remains as belonging to the czar, and neither Patriarch Aleksy nor any other bishop attended the simple interment, though after a last-minute decision, the then-president, Boris N. Yeltsin, did.</p>
        <p>The Romanovs were executed 16 months after Nicholas abdicated the throne on March 15, 1917, as revolutionary fervor swept Russia. He and his family were detained by the Bolsheviks and eventually sent to Yekaterinburg, where on July 17, 1918, they were shot dead in the basement of a merchant's house by a squad of Bolsheviks.</p>
        <p>There was no immediate indication of whether President Vladimir V. Putin would attend the formal canonization rites. Mr. Putin has not made his position on the canonization known, though there has been speculation in the Russian press that he supports the act for its powerful political symbolism. Mr. Putin's first months in office have been marked by efforts to restore central authority to Russia.</p>
        <p>''Putin is a strong guy, and Nicholas II is a representative of a strong empire and this canonization would be a canonization of a strong empire, not of Nicholas II only,'' said Edvard S. Radzinsky, author of ''The Life and Death of Nicholas II'' (Doubleday, 1992). ''I predict that it will be a great show, a show of empire, and Mr. Putin who will take part in this is like a strong guy who remembers about strong times.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin, in a detailed interview published shortly after Mr. Yeltsin named him acting president at the beginning of the year, said that as a teenager in the 1960's dreaming of serving in the K.G.B., he did not know of the mass repressions carried out by the Soviet secret service.</p>
        <p>As president he has demonstrated a loyalty to the Russian church. One of his first public appearances as acting president was at Christmas services in January at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, where the council is being held and where the canonization service will take place.</p>
        <p>Metropolitan Juvenaly, the hierarch in charge of the commission on canonization, reported that the cases of each of the potential martyrs and confessors of the Soviet era were studied individually.</p>
        <p>Among them were clergymen and church workers killed in 1937 and 1938, the worst years of persecution of the church. In 1937, 136,900 churchmen were arrested and 85,300 were executed by the N.K.V.D., the predecessor of the K.G.B. Of the 28,300 arrested in 1938, 21,500 were shot to death.</p>
        <p>Nicholas II and his family have, in fact, been canonized before, by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, in New York City, which canonized the Romanovs as martyrs. But the New York church does not acknowledge the Russian church and itself is not recognized by other Orthodox churches. But many believers in Russia admired its decision.</p>
        <p>Potentially divisive debate over the imperial family was predicted before the bishops' council opened on Sunday. Two icons of the new saints were reportedly prepared, one with the czar and his family, and one without their images. The bishops' council is the second highest body in the Russian Orthodox Church.</p>
