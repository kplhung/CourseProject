        <p>ON the phone, now: Carol Cott Gross, who runs the self-help group Fly Without Fear and who has called to say it's been a tough summer.</p>
        <p>''All of my members are suffering since the Concorde,'' Mrs. Gross is saying, and you will notice, here, that she omits the word ''crash,'' that word, in Mrs. Gross's line of work, being implicit, understood. ''We've had three this summer. There was a crash in Nepal. The small planes in New Jersey. This is very bad for people who are afraid to fly.</p>
        <p>''Then you have all the summer action movies. There's always something bad about flying. Why does a member need to see a movie called 'Turbulence'? I've banned some movies for my members. Any movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis, there's going to be a plane and it's going to be bad.''</p>
        <p>Another thing that's bad: celebrities who are afraid to fly and who talk about it.</p>
        <p>''Too much camaraderie,'' Mrs. Gross says firmly. ''People say, 'He doesn't fly, why should I?' ''</p>
        <p>Oh, were there only live entertainment in what Mrs. Gross calls ''you-should-pardon-the-expression terminals''? Then you could have Mrs. Gross, a souffle of particularly New York phobias (The Holland Tunnel at rush hour? Don't ask!) loosening you up before you got on a flight.</p>
        <p>Warm? If Mrs. Gross, 57, were any friendlier you would have to get an order of protection. Open? You're not on the phone five minutes when she's telling you what an anxiety-ridden bundle she is. Fears of elevators, bridges, enclosed spaces, heights and flying often go together, part of a larger fear of losing control, Mrs. Gross believes. And she has had them all. She has also given lectures and written newspaper articles about them. (Her lectures on fear of driving foundered out on Long Island because people had no way of getting to them.)</p>
        <p>Fly Without Fear, a 31-year-old group that was founded by Mrs. Gross's father, Nathan M. Cott, and by Dr. Ronald Melmed, a cousin who was a psychiatrist, is, however, her main gig. There are weekly meetings at La Guardia Airport, where a pilot may lecture on turbulence. The members may visit a stationary plane or take a short flight.</p>
        <p>''We used to have a flight from La Guardia to J.F.K.,'' Mrs. Gross says from her home in East Northport, N.Y., speed talking, which one senses is not atypical. ''But it was like a quick sex experience: it wasn't really fulfilling. It was a bad idea, the short flight, because it was one quick burst of anxiety and then you were down on the ground. I used to send postcards from J.F.K. I had a script that the pilot or the stewardess would narrate for every sound in the plane: 'No, the wing did not fall off; that was a wing being retracted.'</p>
        <p>''We also used to go into a flight simulator at J.F.K. But it became counterproductive. I had a writer from 'Saturday Night Live' who said: 'I don't have to go on vacation; I'll just fly the simulator every year.' Don't ask.''</p>
        <p>You know what we must fault Mrs. Gross on? Discretion.</p>
        <p>''Are you the same Joyce Wadler who was a member years ago?'' she asks, going back to the 70's, when the reporter attended one meeting.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gross's lineage, however, is impeccable, for she is a second-generation phobic. Her father was an engineer and inventor who feared bridges, tunnels, elevators, trains and planes. In addition, her mother had been a dancer and her grandmother had been in burlesque, ''a bunch of divas, real drama divas,'' as Mrs. Gross puts it, a trait that can dovetail nicely into the problem at hand, but we digress.</p>
        <p>BACK to her phobia. Listening to Mrs. Gross talk about it is like listening to a cross between a therapy session and a stand-up routine. Envision Freud at a set of snare drums, stage right, with the spotlight on Mrs. Gross:</p>
        <p>''When I was growing up, I thought everyone hated the Midtown Tunnel. We'd go into the tunnel, my father would make an announcement: 'Kids, start packing up. If the traffic doesn't move, we're abandoning the car and leaving.' If we went over the 59th Street bridge, my father would have congratulations.''</p>
        <p>Freud on the snares: dada-dum!</p>
        <p>''So there was a family party and everybody was teasing him about being afraid to fly and he put a tiny ad in The New York Times: 'Are you afraid to fly? Call me?' As a joke, he wanted to show my mother that the most intelligent people in New York were afraid to fly. He made fun of his fears, which is what I try to do.'' The jokes fumbling for a moment. ''I've had a very hard life.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gross's life, after her marriage to Herb Gross, a graphic designer: one child born with Down syndrome, who is institutionalized; one child who died soon after birth; two spinal injuries that resulted in her being bedridden for three years; a daughter badly injured in a car accident who fights her way back to health. Mrs. Gross calls that daughter her hero and role model, and when she talks about her, her voice quavers and she fights back tears.</p>
        <p>''She walked down the aisle without braces, without her crutches,'' Mrs. Gross says. ''She married the greatest guy in the world, who I adore. He proposed to her at Madison Square Garden, on the screen, so it was on television.''</p>
        <p>Was Mrs. Gross tense?</p>
        <p>Naturally. But she turned it into a self-help experience:</p>
        <p>''I give lectures on how to do a stress-free wedding. I wrote a story about it.''</p>
