        <p>SIEMENS, the German electronics giant, has reserved 8,000 of the choicest tables in France this summer.</p>
        <p>Foie gras and fine wines, however, are not on the menu. Siemens is more interested in consumer eyeballs. It is using the tables -- modified versions of the ubiquitous Parisian bistro table -- to display advertisements for a new line of cellular telephones.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to get very original promotions where our competitors are not,'' said Christine Blanc Montmayeur, a spokeswoman for Siemens.</p>
        <p>Risking the wrath of a society that takes its cafes very seriously, a French start-up company introduced the advertising medium this spring, altering the traditional small, round French cafe table to put marketing on the menu.</p>
        <p>The company, Impact Diffusion, was formed last year by two entrepreneurs, Akim Rezgui and Jacques Delavault, with 20 million francs, or about $3 million, in backing from a private investor. Mr. Rezgui and Mr. Delavault developed a new tabletop, adding a snare-drum-like enclosure. Underneath a glass cover, there is room for a three-dimensional display.</p>
        <p>Since spring, Impact Diffusion has run campaigns for everything from beer companies to florists to Internet service providers. Impact Diffusion charges 750,000 francs, or just over $100,000, to rent out the network of tables for two weeks. Out of that revenue, Impact said it pays cafe and nightclub owners a fee based on the size and locations of their businesses, but declined to be more specific.</p>
        <p>United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation, used the tabletop ads to introduce a nonstop route linking Paris and Los Angeles. The ad showed a paper-cutout plane making its way down a runway paved with the stars of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. ''Because United Airlines was one of the first, that gave it extra visibility,'' said Geoffroy Epron, a media consultant at Young &amp; Rubicam, which handles United's advertising.</p>
        <p>Some of the ads -- including one for Max, a young men's magazine with covers that feature barely covered models, and one for a brand of cigarette-rolling paper -- appear only in tables placed in nightclubs.</p>
        <p>Siemens, whose campaign started July 29 and is scheduled to run through the end of August, is trying to take the medium a step further, giving it an interactive element. Customers seated at the tables are supposed to get coasters with their drinks that work in conjunction with the ads. The coasters include a mini-quiz; clues to the answers are provided on the tabletops. Customers can also mail in their coasters to participate in a drawing for prizes ranging from vacations in Spain to wristwatches.</p>
        <p>''It is good to entertain the customer when he is very relaxed,'' Ms. Blanc Montmayeur explained.</p>
        <p>Parisian waiters appear to be approaching the game with the same relaxed nonchalance they sometimes employ when asked for the check. At a cafe in the Latin Quarter, the waiter simply shrugged when asked recently why the coaster was missing.</p>
        <p>Some Parisians, however, are anything but relaxed. Globalization, and the host of evils attributed to it, have been a hot topic here. Jose Bove, a sheep farmer turned anticorporate crusader who is accused of wrecking a McDonald's restaurant in the south of France, has become something of a celebrity. Is Impact Diffusion the cutting edge of a further commercial incursion?</p>
        <p>''What a horror,'' said Camille Mouries, a librarian at the National Audiovisual Institute, pointing to the colorful Siemens ad with a mobile phone protruding prominently under the glass.</p>
        <p>''Every time a store closes in Paris, it is replaced by one selling portable phones,'' she said, adding that the profusion of marketing for digital gadgets in Paris made her uneasy. ''It's everywhere. That and the Internet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Delavault argued that France is changing; market research showed that 70 percent of people liked the new ad format. And advertising is not new to French cafes: logo-laden umbrellas, ashtrays and other promotional materials have long been a part of the scene, though the Impact enterprise is the first to sell advertising space to third parties.</p>
        <p>In any case, Mr. Delavault said, the tabletop ads are far less intrusive than other forms of outdoor advertising, like billboards. ''We have the chance to show advertisements in the heart of the city without destroying the environment,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Besides, added Mr. Delavault, the ads serve a useful purpose in a country where whiling away spare time in a cafe is part social ritual, part therapy. ''When I'm all alone, I can look at that, not at my neighbors,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Business is going well, Mr. Rezgui said, though he would not provide specific figures on sales or profitability. In June, he added, Impact Diffusion even had to turn away potential advertisers.</p>
        <p>So far, the six-person company, which built its advertising network by going door-to-door to approach cafe owners, has placed its tables in more than 50 cafes and nightclubs in 14 cities across France.</p>
        <p>''There are 62,000 cafes in France,'' Mr. Rezgui said. ''That gives us a great opportunity.''</p>
