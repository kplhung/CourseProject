        <p>In a sign that nothing in New York is free of a Disney influence these days, Goofy is on the lam, wanted for a break-in robbery in the Bronx. And the bumbling, buck-toothed character has an accomplice, either Elmo of Sesame Street or Dr. Seuss's Grinch.</p>
        <p>But this is no Dr. Seuss story. The two are armed and considered dangerous. At 2:45 a.m. yesterday, Theresa Dassa, 58, awoke to find that she had been joined in her second-floor bedroom by someone in a full-body Goofy get-up, and someone she thought was dressed as Elmo, the squeaky-voiced Muppet. But she also told the police he was green, not red like Elmo, which led detectives to suspect the Grinch, who, after all, has a record for burglary in Whoville.</p>

        <p>In a sign that nothing in New York is free of a Disney influence these days, Goofy is on the lam, wanted for a break-in robbery in the Bronx. And the bumbling, buck-toothed character has an accomplice, either Elmo of Sesame Street or Dr. Seuss's Grinch.</p>
        <p>But this is no Dr. Seuss story. The two are armed and considered dangerous. At 2:45 a.m. yesterday, Theresa Dassa, 58, awoke to find that she had been joined in her second-floor bedroom by someone in a full-body Goofy get-up, and someone she thought was dressed as Elmo, the squeaky-voiced Muppet. But she also told the police he was green, not red like Elmo, which led detectives to suspect the Grinch, who, after all, has a record for burglary in Whoville.</p>
        <p>In any event, Mrs. Dassa was not tickled to see them. The men pointed pistols at her head and her ribs, and stole jewelry, a television and $600 from the kitchen, the police said she told them. They also took her debit card, demanding the PIN number. They then fled in her car, a 1996 dark blue Hyundai Sonata.</p>
        <p>''When I opened my eyes, because I was fast asleep, I didn't even know if I was dreaming or if this was really happening,'' a shaken Mrs. Dassa said yesterday. ''But when I saw the two gun barrels pointed at me straight in the face, I knew it was real.''</p>
        <p>She was insistent on her Elmo identification. Her grandchildren are fans. ''I could feel the furry costume against my skin,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''They had the actual suits, like they wear in Disneyland,'' Mrs. Dassa said. ''I mean, this is why, for the moment, I thought I was dreaming.''</p>
        <p>A neighbor, Virginia Farrell, said she rushed next door when she heard the police arrive. ''A lot of people were saying, 'Thank God she wasn't hurt,' but she was,'' psychologically, Mrs. Farrell said. ''She was hysterical.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Dassa's husband, Jack, died about two years ago. She lives in the Country Club section of the northeast Bronx.  There have been several robberies in the neighborhood in recent months, said her neighbor, Mrs. Farrell.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mrs. Dassa's other next-door neighbors awoke to find the living room windows open and about $25,000 missing, the police said. ''Between my house and her house, they hit Lotto,'' said Jeannine Krzyck, 35. The police said it was not clear if the cases were linked.</p>
        <p>Goofy and his sidekick are still at large, and the disguises are still a matter of mystery. However, Disney does make an adult-size Goofy costume: it sells for $39.99 on the Disney store's Web site.</p>
