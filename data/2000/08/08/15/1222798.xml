        <hl1>Mr. Clinton's Valedictory</hl1>

      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Pres Clinton's speech at Democratic National Convention, both a passionate defense of his record and a steadfast argument that Vice Pres Al Gore is ready to take over, represents end of an era; says that, in party terms, Clinton's great accomplishment was to update the liberal policies that let Democrats dominate midcentury politics but that became a straitjacket when Ronald Reagan arrived on scene; says despite fact that Clinton record will forever be blotted because his leadership gifts were offset by a self-destructive streak, Clinton will go into party history as only politician of his decade with personal magnetism to match those of Reagan and Clinton's own boyhood idol, John F Kennedy</p>

        <p>In an emotional farewell to the party that he reshaped and led for eight turbulent years and to the political arena he will clearly miss, President Clinton last night offered a passionate defense of his record and a steadfast argument that Vice President Al Gore is ready to take over. As students of convention staging will no doubt remember, the president chose an oddly hokey gladiatorial entrance. For fans of presidential oratory, the speech was a reminder of Mr. Clinton's skills as an advocate who can both speak from the heart and argue a case through a series of logical points. The Democrats' enthusiastic reception was testimony to their mixed feelings -- an eagerness to move beyond Mr. Clinton and his outsized personal problems as well as genuine gratitude for his success in modernizing their party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's valedictory appearance, on the first day of the convention, was aimed at letting the president make a best-case argument for his stewardship, before the party turns to the hard work of  pushing Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, across the finish line. Mr. Clinton paid tribute to Mr. Gore's steadiness under pressure and his knowledge of government in arguing that the vice president deserved considerable credit for the successes of the last eight years. He also portrayed Mr. Gore as the most future-oriented politician in the country in regard to science, technology and education issues.</p>

        <p>In an emotional farewell to the party that he reshaped and led for eight turbulent years and to the political arena he will clearly miss, President Clinton last night offered a passionate defense of his record and a steadfast argument that Vice President Al Gore is ready to take over. As students of convention staging will no doubt remember, the president chose an oddly hokey gladiatorial entrance. For fans of presidential oratory, the speech was a reminder of Mr. Clinton's skills as an advocate who can both speak from the heart and argue a case through a series of logical points. The Democrats' enthusiastic reception was testimony to their mixed feelings -- an eagerness to move beyond Mr. Clinton and his outsized personal problems as well as genuine gratitude for his success in modernizing their party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's valedictory appearance, on the first day of the convention, was aimed at letting the president make a best-case argument for his stewardship, before the party turns to the hard work of  pushing Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, across the finish line. Mr. Clinton paid tribute to Mr. Gore's steadiness under pressure and his knowledge of government in arguing that the vice president deserved considerable credit for the successes of the last eight years. He also portrayed Mr. Gore as the most future-oriented politician in the country in regard to science, technology and education issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton dealt with his personal scandals by not mentioning them. He apparently decided that this was not going to be a moment of contrition or one when the headline writers and Republicans would have another mea culpa with which to work. Instead he dwelt on his gratitude to the voters for letting him serve in the White House.</p>
        <p>As he did in recent interviews, Mr. Clinton also made it clear that Republican convention oratory about an era of accidental and purposeless prosperity had nettled him mightily. In response to recent  sallies from the G.O.P. nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Mr. Clinton pointed out that when the administration enacted its economic strategy of trying to close the budget deficit, even by raising taxes on the richest Americans, the Republican leadership in Congress voted uniformly against it and predicted it would bring about economic ruin. ''Time has not been kind to those predictions,'' he declared. Indeed, as he pointed out, it was Mr. Gore who supplied the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.</p>
        <p>The president's most explicit effort to sell Mr. Gore as a presidential-scale leader came in a personal testimony to him as ''one strong leader'' who is capable, indeed eager to make ''tough choices.'' He also praised Mr. Lieberman, noting that he had known the Connecticut senator since working for his first state legislative campaign while a law student 30 years ago. And when Mr. Clinton reminded the audience of his own personal journey to the White House from a small-town boyhood, he seemed to be trying to contrast himself with the pampered upbringing of Governor Bush, who is seen by many Americans as a man they can empathize with more than Mr. Gore. In an emotional touch, he spoke of the gray hair and wrinkles that now mark his visage, but have not dimmed ''optimism and hope I brought to the work I love eight years ago.''</p>
        <p>One of the strongest flashes of irritation from Mr. Clinton came when he defended his administration's record on military and preparedness issues. At the Philadelphia convention the Republicans charged relentlessly that American defenses had declined in the last eight years, ignoring the fact that military budgets had started to go down under President Bush and have gone back up in the last several years. Mr. Clinton boasted that the United States had expanded human rights in the tradition of former President Jimmy Carter, who was sitting in the audience, and then went on to suggest that the Republicans were inviting trouble from overseas with their accusations. Any foreign country inspired by the Republican Party to think that America is not ready to defend itself, he said, would be gravely mistaken.</p>
        <p>In a sense, the last convention of any two-term president can be called the end of an era. But there is no doubt that this farewell will be remembered by every living Democrat as an unforgettable time. In party terms, Mr. Clinton's great accomplishment was to update the liberal policies that let the Democrats dominate midcentury politics but that became a straitjacket when Ronald Reagan arrived on the scene. There will always be the sadness that the Clinton record will forever be blotted because his leadership gifts were offset by a self-destructive streak at the center of his personality. For all that, Mr. Clinton will go into party history as the only politician of his decade with a personal magnetism and communicative skills to match those of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Clinton's own boyhood idol, John F. Kennedy.</p>
