        <p>President Clinton savored what he called ''this moment of unprecedented good fortune'' and, in a nostalgic valedictory tonight, implored Americans to protect his achievements by electing Al Gore to succeed him.</p>

        <p>President Clinton savored what he called ''this moment of unprecedented good fortune'' and, in a nostalgic valedictory tonight, implored Americans to protect his achievements by electing Al Gore to succeed him.</p>
        <p>''One of the very best decisions of my entire life,'' he said, was ''asking Al Gore to be my partner.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton made no direct mention of Gov. George W. Bush during his address on the opening night of the 43rd Democratic National Convention, he scoffed at the recent suggestion by the Republican nominee that the nation had stumbled into prosperity. [Transcript, Page A17.]</p>
        <p>''To those who say -- and I'm sure you've heard this somewhere in the last few days -- the progress of these eight years was just some sort of accident that we just coasted along, let me be clear: America's success was not a matter of chance,'' Mr. Clinton said in a swan song that lasted about 40 minutes. ''It was a matter of choice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton made no allusions to the personal scandals he has weathered; at a church last week, the president said his transgressions should not tar Mr. Gore. Instead, Mr. Clinton catalogued the high points of his entire two terms, the longest presidential tenure of a Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt, who died in 1945 after 12 years in office.</p>
        <p>The president also tried to transfer his popularity among the faithful to Vice President Gore, who has had an arduous time rousing his party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who has said Mr. Gore's election is crucial to protecting his own legacy, offered this testament: ''In the most challenging moments, when we faced the most difficult issues of war and peace, of whether to take on some powerful special interests, he was always there.''</p>
        <p>Linking Mr. Gore to the economic good times, Mr. Clinton said of his ambitious plan to cut the deficit in 1993: ''It passed by a single vote in both houses. In a deadlocked Senate, Al Gore cast the deciding vote. Not a single Republican supported it. Their leaders said our plan would increase the deficit, kill jobs and give us a one-way ticket to recession.''</p>
        <p>He paused for effect: ''Time has not been kind to their predictions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's entrance to the hall steadily built. As the crowd roared in anticipation, a camera followed him as he strode briskly down a corridor toward the stage for his moment of triumph. When he said his first ''thank you'' to settle the adoring crowd, a chant broke out, ''Thank you, Bill!''</p>
        <p>And at times the speech seemed as much an argument for yet another campaign as a celebration of things past. Occasionally, the crowd broke out into cries of ''let's go, Bill!'' as if he were the nominee.</p>
        <p>Even as Mr. Clinton was trying to hand off the party to Mr. Gore, the production tonight lacked the end-of-an-era wistfulness of Ronald Reagan's farewell in 1988.</p>
        <p>That was in part because Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary, was front and center, speaking in her new role as Senate candidate. Mrs. Clinton not only commended her husband and blessed the nomination of Mr. Gore but sought to bolster her own bid for the Senate from New York.</p>
        <p>After calling on the public to ''continue America's progress'' by electing Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Mrs. Clinton turned to her own race.</p>
        <p>''For me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in the United States Senate,'' she said. ''But I will always be profoundly grateful to all of you and to the American people for the last eight years. Really, the most important thing that I can say tonight is thank you.''</p>
        <p>In contrast to the Republican convention two weeks ago, which was choreographed to second-by-second precision, the Democratic gathering -- typical for the party -- had the untamed feel of street theater. Mr. Clinton did not reach the rostrum until close to 11 p.m. E.D.T., nearly 25 minutes past schedule, and missed most of the prime-time TV audience.  A top aide said the president did not finish tinkering with his speech until about 9:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>During a year in which Mr. Clinton has surrendered the political stage to his vice president and to his wife -- only grudgingly, his friends and advisers say -- the event tonight was a prime-time reminder of how the president dominates his party as a political and oratorical force.</p>
        <p>And to some delegates, it was a reminder that Mr. Gore faces a daunting challenge in trying to inspire voters as skillfully as Mr. Clinton -- widely regarded as the party's most adroit campaigner since John F. Kennedy, who was nominated at a convention in Los Angeles in 1960.</p>
        <p>The outpouring for Mr. Clinton underscored a daunting problem for Mr. Gore: the more powerful that Mr. Clinton was in his speech, the less likely that the vice president could pull off a climactic acceptance speech Thursday night.</p>
        <p>''There's a certain sadness to this evening,'' said Cheri Hamilton, a delegate from Kentucky who covered herself in Clinton-Gore buttons. ''They have been a good team, Clinton and Gore. Gore will work well with Lieberman. But I'm really going to miss Bill.''</p>
        <p>Bob Grizzard, a Florida delegate who wore a Clinton '92 T-shirt over his dress shirt and tie, said, ''I would vote for Clinton again if I could but, unfortunately, the Constitution says I can't.''</p>
        <p>Everywhere on the convention floor were signs reflecting the crowd's deep affection for the Clintons. A woman, bopping to the music, waved a sign that proclaimed, ''Iowa Loves Clinton.'' Similar signs could be seen in the Kansas section, in Utah, Florida, Indiana, New Mexico and elsewhere. The New York contingent hoisted dozens of ''Hillary'' posters, waving them madly and passing a few to delegates in the Colorado section.</p>
        <p>When short excerpts of past convention speeches by Democratic presidents were shown on a screen overhead, there was warm applause for Mr. Kennedy, and polite applause for Jimmy Carter. But the moment Mr. Clinton's face filled the screen, the hall exploded with cheers. It was impossible not to notice that the sound fell slightly but unmistakably when Mr. Clinton's clip was followed by one of Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Another explanation for an apparent lack of excitement about Mr. Gore among some of the 4,339 delegates is that polls show he is trailing Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Mr. Clinton faced one of the most precarious political challenges of his career: to offer a stout endorsement of Mr. Gore that will spur Democrats -- and the American public -- to rally around the vice president. But he also had to take care to leave Mr. Gore some room to declare his independence.</p>
        <p>He devoted far more attention to Mr. Gore than to Mrs. Clinton, whom he praised for her work with children and for being ''a great first lady,'' who will ''always be there for the families of New York and America.''</p>
        <p>For much of his address, Mr. Clinton reprieved what he considered the triumphs of his own administration, from cutting taxes to cracking down on crime to cleaning the environment to making the world more secure. He did not recall any of the failures of his tenure, notably his wife's campaign to overhaul the health care system.</p>
        <p>Invoking the slogan of his acceptance speech four years ago, he declared: ''My fellow Americans, tonight we can say with gratitude and humility: We built our bridge to the 21st century. We crossed that bridge together. And we're not going back.''</p>
        <p>The president drew one of the biggest ovations when he recalled Mr. Reagan's famous refrain from 1980. ''My fellow Americans, are we better off today than we were eight years ago?'' he asked. ''You bet we are.''</p>
        <p>Asserting that the new ticket would build on his foundation, Mr. Clinton said: ''Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will keep our prosperity going by paying down the debt, investing in education and health care and providing family tax cuts that we can afford. Now that stands in stark contrast to the position of our Republican friends.'' He offered what sounded like a point-by-point rebuttal of Mr. Bush's acceptance speech two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Clinton's presence tonight could not help but remind viewers of the Clinton administration scandals that the Bush campaign is intent on keeping alive. For some Democrats, the president's departure on Tuesday could not come too soon.</p>
        <p>As Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. of Illinois put it at a news conference today, ''We've got to get Bill Clinton -- and I'm going to say this quite frankly and quite bluntly -- out of town as quickly as possible and get to these issues and not make our convention some referendum on what occurred in the impeachment process.''</p>
        <p>The evening was clearly an emotional crest for Mr. Clinton and his stalwart supporters. Advisers to Mr. Clinton said he was choking up as he rehearsed his lines earlier in the day.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of the address, Mr. Clinton, who turns 54 on Saturday, harkened back to his roots in Arkansas. ''Fifty-four years ago this week, I was born in a summer storm to a young widow in a small Southern town. America gave me the chance to live my dreams. I have tried to give you a better chance to live yours. Now, with hair grayer and wrinkles deeper, but with the same optimism and hope I brought to the work I love eight years ago, my heart is filled with gratitude.''</p>
        <p>Beyond the objective of pumping up Mr. Gore for four nights, the Democrats sought to portray the Republicans as staging a masquerade of moderation at their convention.</p>
        <p>Speaker after speaker stirred up the Democratic faithful by upbraiding the opposition.</p>
        <p>''The Republicans put on quite a spectacle in Philadelphia,'' said Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the convention and the party's most proflific fund raiser. ''They pretended they were tolerant. They pretended they were moderates. They pretended they cared about education, health care and the environment. Let's face it, they pretended they were Democrats.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Gray Davis of California welcomed the delegates, saying, ''Here in the home of the film industry, we've seen the previews of the Republicans' movie, 'George and Dick's Excellent Adventure.' I don't think it's going to make it.''</p>
        <p>And Andrew Tobias, the Democratic Party's treasurer, said: ''The Democratic leadership celebrates diversity, not for show -- for real. They have made my life and the lives of millions of other gay and lesbian Americans immeasurably better.''</p>
        <p>On this first day, there was not quite the harmony that so marked the Republican convention. Representative Loretta Sanchez of California rebuffed an offer to address the convention, saying she didn't want to appear as if she had been motivated by ''personal gain'' when -- under pressure from the Gore campaign -- she agreed to move a fund-raiser from the Playboy mansion.</p>
