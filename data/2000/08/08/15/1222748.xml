        <p>BROOKLYN: WEST NILE VIRUS DETECTED  Evidence of West Nile virus has been found in Brooklyn for the first time this year, leading city officials to prepare plans for spraying pesticides in Brooklyn as early as Thursday night. An infected dead crow was picked up on Aug. 3 in the Canarsie section, with the positive confirmation of the virus coming just yesterday, officials said. The infection has now been found in all five boroughs. Details of the spraying may be announced as early as today, officials said.</p>

        <p>BEACON: SEEGER'S BANJO MISSING  A $1,000 banjo handmade by Pete Seeger, the folk singer, is missing and presumed stolen. Mr. Seeger, 81, traveled to Rosendale in Ulster County with his banjo last Tuesday and is not sure how or when it disappeared from his car. Mr. Seeger performed at the Beacon Corn Festival here in Dutchess County on Sunday. Mr. Seeger recorded his song ''Where Have All The Flowers Gone'' with the 55-year-old banjo. He is offering a $1,000 reward.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: NAZI DEPORTATION  An immigration judge yesterday ordered a former Nazi guard deported to Austria. The former guard, Michael Gruber, 85, of New City, in Rockland County, persecuted civilians at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, the Justice Department charged. Judge Robert D. Weisel ruled that the government had proved its case and that Mr. Gruber must be called to account. Robert Murtha, Mr. Gruber's lawyer, said his client, who he said was ill, never committed war crimes. Mr. Murtha said he hoped appeals would delay deportation for the rest of his client's life.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: INJURED POLICEMEN SENT HOME  Two of the four police officers who were shot in a gun battle with a deranged former prison guard on Saturday were discharged from the hospital yesterday. Officers Gregory John and Joseph Ocasio left Kings County Hospital Center and were both recuperating at home, officials said. The most seriously injured officer, Jose Guerra, was transferred to the Downstate Medical Center, where he underwent surgery yesterday and was sitting up and speaking last night. The fourth officer, James McGrath, was treated and released immediately after the shootout, in which the gunman, Arthur Alalouf, died.  C.J. Chivers (NYT)</p>
        <p>SYRACUSE: BILLIONS SOUGHT IN INDIAN CLAIM  An economist said yesterday that the Cayuga Indian Nation should receive $1.7 billion in interest dating to 1795 for being deprived of its ancestral homelands for more than two centuries. The economist, Peter Temin, testified in behalf of the Cayugas, who, a jury ruled, were illegally deprived of 64,027 acres of land in Cayuga and Seneca Counties by New York State in 1795 and 1807. Mr. Temin said his calculations were based on an estimate of rent from the land invested in Treasury bonds. Earlier, the jury awarded the Cayugas $36.9 million as the fair market value of the land. Interest on that amount is to be set by the judge.</p>

        <p>NEW HARTFORD: $35 MILLION SHOPLIFTING RING  Two more defendants in a $35 million shoplifting ring were sentenced yesterday to incarceration. Anthony Carcone, 59, of Utica, was sentenced to one to three years in state prison and Laurie Malozzi, 39, of Utica was sentenced to five months in the Oneida County jail. In June, five members of the shoplifting ring that operated in 11 counties were sentenced.</p>

        <p>WATERBURY: WELFARE OFFICIAL ARRESTED  A veteran supervisor in the State Department of Social Services has been arrested and charged with embezzling more than $190,000 from Connecticut's welfare program, the chief state's attorney, John M. Bailey, said yesterday. From January 1998 to last month, the supervisor, Helen Pearl Byrd, 66, of Waterbury, illegally credited more than $190,000 in welfare benefits to the account of Griselle Ramirez, 28, a welfare recipient, Mr. Bailey said. Ms. Ramirez would then split the money with Ms. Byrd, Mr. Bailey added. Both women were arrested and charged with larceny.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: FLOOD RELIEF SOUGHT  Gov. John G. Rowland is seeking federal disaster relief aid for Fairfield County, which flooded during weekend rainstorms. Governor Rowland wrote a letter to President Clinton requesting financial aid for businesses ruined by flash floods on Friday and Saturday, as well as for some homeowners. The aid would provide low-interest loans to flood victims. Mr. Rowland has also asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration to assess flood damage in Stratford and other areas in the county.</p>

        <p>NEW HAVEN: RECORD TEACHER HIRINGS  Public school systems in Connecticut are in the midst of a hiring boom not seen since the 1950's, new figures show. Last year, 62 percent of new teachers got jobs within a year of obtaining their certification, according to the State Education Department. In 1982, barely 22 percent of graduates got jobs the first year.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: TAX CREDIT FOR POOR  Gov. Christine Todd Whitman yesterday signed into law a new state earned-income tax credit in addition to the federal earned-income tax credit. Nearly 240,000 families who earn $20,000 or less a year and have children can claim on their tax returns an additional 20 percent credit of up to $800. Families that do not have taxable income can claim the credit as a refund. The plan, costing nearly $100 million a year, will be phased in over four years.</p>
