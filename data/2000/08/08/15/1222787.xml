        <p>The transfer of power is one of the key tests of democracy. At the governmental level, the United States has managed it exceptionally well ever since George Washington, hero of the war that brought the nation into being, handed over to John Adams in 1797.</p>
        <p>But before the reins of government can pass from one hand to another, party leadership must be transferred, in a process for which there is no set of statutes and no rule book. It has often proved difficult for sitting presidents, especially in the modern era, when vice presidents more or less automatically seek the presidency. So it has proved for President Clinton, despite largely cordial relations with Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Mr. Clinton sought to lift the Gore campaign onto a new, smoother road. He described Mr. Gore as ''a profoundly good man'' whom he had come to know well in eight years. But his words about Mr. Gore did not form the emotional climax of his speech.</p>
        <p>For better or worse, Mr. Gore takes over the leadership of the Democratic Party this week. That was decided when he saw off his rival, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, in the primaries. But what remains to be decided is how thoroughly he can put his stamp on the party. Can he make it his own? Or will he be deemed only second-best by the party faithful?</p>
        <p>Another question: Will Mr. Clinton really let go of the baton? The Clintons hope, of course, to retain a presence in Washington in the form of a New York Senate seat -- something the delegates here were repeatedly reminded of -- and if they do so, Mr. Clinton will surely be a significant part of that presence.</p>
        <p>That was the subtext tonight as the president, wildly popular among his fellow Democrats through the ups and downs of the last eight years, appeared before the convention. The hard fact is, Mr. Gore needs help, most of all from Mr. Clinton. Paradoxically, he needs both the enthusiastic endorsement of the president and his help in escaping the long presidential shadow.</p>
        <p>In a speech that sounded at times more like a State of the Union address than anything else, Mr. Clinton was unstinting in his praise of his vice president. During ''the most difficult days,'' the president said, Mr. Gore ''was always there.'' The president added: ''More than anybody else I've ever known in public life, Al Gore understands the future and how sweeping changes and scientific breakthroughs will affect ordinary Americans' daily lives.''</p>
        <p>But unlike Ronald Reagan, who promised at the 1988 convention that he would gladly serve as ''a foot soldier'' in George Bush's forthcoming campaign if needed, Mr. Clinton avoided a pledge to crisscross the country this fall for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Speaking also to the television audience, he made an untypically restrained comment that stopped short of a direct appeal for votes.</p>
        <p>''You know how I feel,'' he said. ''But it's not my decision to make. That belongs to the American people.  I just want to tell all of you gathered in this great arena a few things I know about Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>All in all, the Clintons will have spent more than three days here by the time they leave on Tuesday morning. Before he spoke tonight, Mr. Clinton had delivered seven other officially announced speeches today, and no doubt some off-hand remarks as well. He and his wife, Hillary, who have raised money with a zeal unmatched by any other first family in history, apparently saw no need to deviate from their routine during Mr. Gore's big week here, even when people close to Mr. Gore gnashed their teeth in frustration.</p>
        <p>They were almost as omnipresent as the morning mist this weekend.</p>
        <p>The contrast with Mr. Reagan's 1988 behavior was sharp. He spent only 48 hours at the New Orleans convention that year, scheduled only three major public appearances and made a determined effort to transfer some of his inner fire, and a bit of his electoral appeal, to his more diffident No. 2.</p>
        <p>Months later, when Mr. and Mrs. Reagan again slipped offstage quickly and quietly, leaving Washington without even staying for the post-inaugural lunch at the Capitol, Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's press secretary, explained their attitude this way: ''It's a sense of what's right. It's their party. It's the Bushes' victory. Let them enjoy it.''</p>
        <p>After initially giving a lukewarm endorsement, Mr. Reagan campaigned hard for George Bush, the father of this year's Republican nominee, emerging in the campaign's last days as Mr. Bush's main surrogate. He traveled 25,000 miles.</p>
        <p>Late in the 1960 campaign, after describing himself as ''just a spectator,'' Dwight D. Eisenhower leapt into the fray in a bid to save the day for his vice president, Richard M. Nixon. It was a stirring sight, James Reston wrote in The New York Times that fall, ''the old pro coming off the bench and swinging for the fences for the last time.'' John F. Kennedy won anyway.</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Clinton will do the same remains up in the air. Democratic state chairmen from New Jersey to Wisconsin to Oregon have been pressing Mr. Clinton to stump hard for Mr. Gore, in the hope that he could brighten a campaign that has often seemed inert and uninspired.  The White House has said it will let Mr. Gore make the decision, but the chairmen, by and large, think the president's presence on the trail is worth the gamble that he might well remind voters how much more exciting than his protege he can be.</p>
        <p>''I'd have the president in this state every chance I got,'' said Kam Kuwata, a California campaign consultant. ''We need the energy, and he's the one who has the energy.''</p>
        <p>Odds are Mr. Clinton will answer the call. Sooner or later, as Election Day approached, each one of the presidents since World War II whose vice presidents sought to succeed them has felt the pull of the stump.</p>
        <p>Delegates on the floor lustily cheered both Mr. and Mrs. Clinton tonight. But they were divided in another respect. Some, like Eleanor Sobel, a state representative from Hollywood, Fla., said Mr. Gore could carry the party banner as well as Mr. Clinton, and argued that it was time now for the president to move on.  Others, like Greg Salazar from Las Vegas, N.M., expressed concern that Mr. Clinton would overshadow Mr. Gore. But even Mr. Salazar said that if the race looked close, ''the president should come out in public and ask the people to vote for Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>The United States has never had a coup d'etat. It shares that distinction with only a few other countries. In fact, only once in more than 200 years has the outcome of a national election, and hence the right to the presidency, been disputed beyond the Electoral College's verdict. That was in 1876, when the Democrats charged that the Republicans had stolen the election for Rutherford B. Hayes, and even then, the inaugural went ahead on schedule.</p>
        <p>But president after president has wrestled with the question of his own succession. Eisenhower tried in 1955 to ease Nixon out of the cabinet, toying with the names of Henry Cabot Lodge and Nelson A. Rockefeller as possible replacements. Asked five years later to name ''a major idea'' of Nixon's that he had adopted,'' the president answered, in a tone of overwhelming boredom: ''If you give me a week, I might think of one.  I don't remember.''</p>
        <p>In his turn, Nixon decided in the spring of 1971 that John B. Connally, the former governor of Texas, should be his successor, not Spiro T. Agnew.  But when Agnew was forced to resign in 1973, Nixon was unable to win assurances of confirmation by the Senate.</p>
        <p>But no one was as conflicted as Lyndon B. Johnson. He was furious that his vice president, Hubert H. Humphrey, harbored doubts about the Vietnam War, and he told friends that ''Hubert cries too much.''</p>
        <p>Only on Nov. 3, 1968, at the tail-end of the campaign, did he give full-throated backing to Humphrey, standing next to him at the Astrodome in Houston and shouting, ''That man, my friend and co-worker for 20 years, is a healer and a builder and will represent all of the people all of the time.''</p>
        <p>The tensions between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore never became as severe as those in some past administrations. But this handoff has not been without significant friction, and Mr. Gore can afford little of that.</p>
