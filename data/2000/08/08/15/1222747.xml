        <p>Senator Robert G. Torricelli, in perhaps the most improbable speech of his two-decade career, conceded today to New Jersey delegates who are here for the Democratic National Convention that he had misjudged their support in trying to usurp James E. McGreevey's place as the party's likely candidate for governor next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli is here almost as dual personas. He is both the powerful New Jersey senator who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and flits from one big-ticket gala to another, and the chastened New Jersey politician whose bid for the party's Democratic nomination for governor turned out to be a humiliating dud.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli did not apologize for the divisions he had created before withdrawing from the race on July 31, nor for the difficult decisions he had forced many officials to make. Nor did he endorse Mr. McGreevey.  But he nonetheless asked Democrats to unify behind the party's candidates this November before taking up the 2001 governor's race again. And in an uncharacteristically self-effacing way, Mr. Torricelli suggested that he had accepted his defeat, and was ready to move on.</p>
        <p>''I needed that,'' Mr. Torricelli said when greeted with a standing ovation, adding later that it had nearly moved him to tears.</p>
        <p>From there, it was off to 4 receptions (out of 29 this week that he said should raise $4 million for Democratic Senate candidates), a short speech on the convention floor, and another night of party-hopping. And on Tuesday night, Mr. Torricelli is to be the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's guest of honor at Spago, the ultimate Los Angeles party place.</p>
        <p>Not so long ago it looked as if this week would also be the moment of Mr. Torricelli's ascension to the throne of New Jersey politics: his coronation as nominee for the governorship he has coveted for years. Instead, it is Mr. McGreevey who is meeting with governors and constituency groups here, burnishing his image on the issues and laying the groundwork to raise as much as $20 million for his campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli, speaking to hundreds of New Jerseyans at their hotel in Glendale, was applauded when he declared that Republicans from Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to the leaders of the State Legislature ''have simply lost the right to lead.''</p>
        <p>And he was greeted warmly when he said that Democrats needed to pull together to heal wounds that he seemed to acknowledge he had helped to deepen. ''There is no reason for this political party in the state of New Jersey to have any divisions of region, or ideology, or personality,'' he said. ''We can all have our differences about who would lead us best, win by the widest margins or achieve victory. I had my own view,'' he added, eliciting laughter at his own expense.</p>
        <p>Yet despite Mr. Torricelli's talk of unity, and the standing ovation his mention of Mr. McGreevey received, it was clear today that many who supported Mr. Torricelli's candidacy for governor remained lukewarm, at best, about Mr. McGreevey. Some said Mr. Torricelli's original argument -- that Mr. McGreevey did not have the electoral heft to sweep other Democrats into office -- remained persuasive. ''My concern is the need to elect a Democratic Assembly and Senate,'' said Joseph Doria, the Assembly minority leader and would-be speaker. ''We need the coattails.''</p>
        <p>And many of Mr. McGreevey's supporters continued to speak disparagingly -- albeit on the condition of anonymity -- of Mr. Torricelli's political future.</p>
        <p>For the record, Mr. Torricelli said today that he would run for a second term in 2002. But he said he had given up his gubernatorial ambitions for good. ''That moment has passed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For all the damage his image has sustained in New Jersey since last month, his high profile in Los Angeles gives little indication that he has been diminished on the national stage.</p>
        <p>Senator Tom Daschle, who had named him chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Mr. Torricelli had not lost any esteem among his colleagues. ''I was glad he made a decision to stay in the Senate, because he's an outstanding leader and he has a bright future there,'' Mr. Daschle said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Torricelli's failure in New Jersey was noticed nationally, nonetheless. One prominent Democratic lawyer attending a fund-raiser in Santa Monica on Sunday observed that most politicians interested in running for higher office would float a trial balloon first, to avoid embarrassment. ''Torricelli floated a very large and incendiary device,'' the lawyer said. ''He floated the Hindenburg, and he was a passenger on it.''</p>
        <p>And Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who has long feuded with Mr. Torricelli, suggested in an interview that his rival's brief candidacy for governor had not been well received in Washington.</p>
        <p>''When in New Jersey, we're facing a significant opportunity to keep a Democrat in the Senate, to help Al Gore get elected with a significant plurality, everyone knows that we have to do it in concert,'' Senator Lautenberg said. ''So it's noted outside when a disruption comes along that is fundamentally divisive.</p>
        <p>''Maybe, inadvertently, it had a good outcome, because it pulled Democrats together as nothing we've seen in the last four or five years,'' Mr. Lautenberg added. ''And Jim McGreevey is stronger for it.''</p>
