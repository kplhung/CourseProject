        <p>A day after the Ford Motor Company singled out a factory here that makes Firestone tires as the main source of a problem that led to the recall of more than 6.5 million tires last week, workers and union officials said today that they were not to blame for the faulty tires.</p>
        <p>The workers said that Ford might be trying to deflect attention away from possible design flaws in its sports utility vehicles, which used the tires. They said a similar announcement last week by Bridgestone/Firestone could be a pressure tactic in the company's continuing labor negotiations with the union.</p>
        <p>The workers said they were puzzled by statistical evidence released by Ford that showed that the rate of injury and damage claims for tires made in Decatur between 1994 and 1996, when the plant here was largely manned by replacement workers, was often three to six times higher than that of other factories.</p>
        <p>Despite these figures, many factory workers here say they are skeptical of the evidence because it is inconsistent with the awards the plant has won and management satisfaction with the jobs many of them have done for more than 20 years.</p>
        <p>They point to all the ''Quality One'' awards they have received over the years from Ford. And they say that when the company wants to create a new line of tires, it often chooses the huge red factory building that is spread across 52 acres here in Decatur.</p>
        <p>Larry Werve, a 29-year employee of the factory, said many workers here thought design or engineering flaws were the more likely culprit. And they are questioning why Ford was recommending the tires be inflated with air pressure at 26 pounds per square inch when the plant recommends and tests the tires at 30 pounds. ''We're looking at Ford and they're looking back at us,'' he said. ''It's a chess match. And we're pawns.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, even though the factory was operated by replacement workers when the union went on strike in 1994, union leaders said today that they were unaware of any quality control lapses during that period. ''I don't know any time that the plant put out a bad tire,'' said Roger Gates, president of the union. ''I've never seen the company jeopardize the product.''</p>
        <p>Officials at Bridgestone/Firestone say they are reviewing the figures Ford cited, but they do not think the strike had any effect on the quality of tires produced in Decatur. Late today, Ford and Bridgestone said they were sending officials to examine the plant.</p>
        <p>The Decatur workers also bitterly denounced a lawsuit that contends that there were quality control problems at the plant for more than a decade, including processes that may have created faulty tires more prone to splitting apart.</p>
        <p>But Bruce Kaster, a lawyer in Ocala, Fla., who has filed suit against  Bridgestone/Firestone, says he has found several former Firestone employees from Decatur who are willing to testify that there were many quality control problems at the plant here and that the demands put on workers contributed to the production of dangerous tires.</p>
        <p>''There was always an emphasis on quantity and not quality,'' Mr. Kaster said today. ''A breakdown in quality control in the plant results in a catastrophe on the highways.''</p>
        <p>None of the workers interviewed today said they had known about such conditions, even though many said they were 20-  and 30-year employees. They questioned the motives of the former employees and said that the plant workers had always taken pride in the tires they produced and even bought them for their own cars and their own families.</p>
        <p>The reason so much attention has focused on Decatur, though, is clearly the bitter union strike that began in 1994. At the time, there were also strikes at the city's two other major employers: Caterpillar and A. E. Staley. Union officials say the 1,800 workers here walked out after Bridgestone, a Japanese company that acquired Firestone in 1988, began making stringent demands to scale back the work force, pay and vacation time, among other things.</p>
        <p>''We had good working relations, and we just wanted to keep things the way they were,'' said John Blair, 67, who retired after the strike.</p>
        <p>''But the Japanese wanted more,'' he said. ''They wanted to cut back on vacation time.''</p>
        <p>Many of the workers were out for more than a year and angered when the company hired replacement workers. In 1995, about 300 members crossed the picket lines.</p>
        <p>Ralph Coates, 63, said that about that time cancer was diagnosed in his wife, a nurse at the company, and he was out of a job watching people he considered friends cross the picket line. Today, he said, a wall of shame exists at a union hall that casts scorn on those considered disloyal.</p>
        <p>Harland Smith, who has been with the company more than 30 years, says it was ugly and painful. ''Many people couldn't survive,'' he said. ''If you wanted a job, you had to go out of town. Many went to Indianapolis, which is 150 miles away.''</p>
        <p>When the workers returned in 1995, the regular eight-hour days had become 12-hour days where they worked in two and three-day cycles. The company was demanding more, and some former workers say there was often too much pressure to produce, and perhaps even problems hiring replacement workers skilled enough to produce quality tires on the company's rigid schedule. But even they doubt any of that resulted in years of defective tires.</p>
        <p>''I can't speculate; I wasn't there,'' Mr. Werve said about the accusations that faulty tires were made during the strike. ''But I think quality control would have caught it. You know, all we do is make the tire. Ford and Firestone design it and they test it.''</p>
        <p>The workers here also say they would never have engaged in retaliation because of hard feelings about the strike. They say they realize how important tires are and they know they are dealing with human lives.</p>
        <p>Many of them believe a combination of factors are at work. They speculate about possible design flaw; about pressure on Ford and Firestone to find answers that will appease a wary public; and about a handful of former workers who may have some other reason for saying there were quality problems.</p>
        <p>They say they enjoy their jobs, the pay (about $18 an hour) and feel they are being unfairly singled out. Indeed, Decatur, they say, has been hit again by an unfortunate set of circumstances. After the major strikes in the mid-1990's, the Archer Daniels Midland Company was rocked by a major price-fixing scandal, and Jesse Jackson came to town recently because of a racial incident at a local high school football game. And now, the city they call ''the Pride of the Prairie'' is being blamed for one of the largest tire recalls in history.</p>
        <p>''It's sad,'' Mr. Coates said. ''We went from being the Pride of the Prairie to Sin City almost overnight.''</p>
