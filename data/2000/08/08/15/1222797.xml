        <p>The gas explosion that leveled one town house, destroyed a neighboring one and killed three people in Brooklyn last month was probably primed by a leaky pipe in the first house's basement and ignited by someone flipping a light switch, fire marshals said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The marshals reached their conclusion by the process of elimination, after ruling out  service mains in the street, the house's gas meters and the stove and other appliances, said Battalion Chief Brian Dixon, a Fire Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>''Somewhere between the meters and the appliances, the piping somehow failed,'' Chief Dixon said. And because the blast destroyed all evidence, he said, ''What caused it to fail, we'll never know.''</p>
        <p>The explosion at 420 State Street in Boerum Hill on the evening of July 12 killed Leonard and Harriet Walit, the retired couple who lived in the house, and their next-door neighbor Khay Cochran, who had come to help them find the source of the gas smell. Mr. Cochran's house, at No. 418, was half destroyed and had to be demolished as well.</p>
        <p>Fire marshals and investigators from KeySpan Energy Corporation, the utility that supplies the neighborhood with natural gas, spent a month searching for the blast's cause, Chief Dixon said. KeySpan's lines were ruled out within two days of the explosion, leaving investigators to determine where in the house the gas had come from.</p>
        <p>''They pressure-tested the meters, and the meters didn't leak,'' Chief Dixon said. ''They did a test to make sure gas was flowing through the meter correctly, and it was.''</p>
        <p>That left the pipes in the house and the appliances, Chief Dixon said. The appliances -- a water heater, a boiler and a stove, all recovered from the wreckage -- were sent out to independent laboratories, which found no sign of leaks, the chief said.</p>
        <p>More evidence that the appliances were not at fault came when the investigators determined how much gas must have built up in the basement in the hours before the explosion, more than could have leaked out through the appliances, Chief Dixon said.</p>
        <p>The Walits, the chief explained, had left their house around 7 in the morning that day with nothing apparently amiss, and returned around 7:30 p.m. to a house smelling of gas.</p>
        <p>During those 12 1/2 hours, about 4,000 cubic feet of gas went unaccounted for, the chief said. The investigators determined this by comparing the house's normal usage for the time of year to the amount used this year, taking into account the amount of gas that probably escaped from the pipe in the minutes after the explosion but before KeySpan shut off the line in the street.</p>
        <p>A worker in the utility industry familiar with the layout of gas lines in Brooklyn said that it would take ''well over five hours'' for a house pipe leaking gas at full strength to discharge 4,000 cubic feet of it. Neighbors said they had smelled gas near the Walits' house from mid-afternoon on.</p>
        <p>KeySpan Energy declined yesterday to say what the house's typical gas usage was. ''We have not been allowed to release or interpret any of the information until the fire marshal issues his report formally,'' said Robert J. Mahoney, a spokesman for KeySpan. The marshals issued their findings informally in a memo to the fire commissioner yesterday, Chief Dixon said.</p>
        <p>Four thousand cubic feet of gas could not have leaked out of the appliances in 12 hours, Chief Dixon said, adding that in any case, if the appliances had leaked, their pilot lights would have set off the explosion sooner. A leaky pipe in the basement would mean that the appliances could have lost their gas supply, which would cause their pilot lights to go out.</p>
        <p>Thus when the Walits and Mr. Cochran turned on the cellar light, the electric pulse inside the switch could have detonated the accumulated gas, the chief said.</p>
        <p>''That one spark would have been enough,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It was not clear how old the gas pipes in the Walit house were or what condition they were in. Their house was built in 1868, but presumably the pipes had been replaced at some point, Chief Dixon said. Early reports after the blast that someone had been working on the pipes recently proved unfounded, he said.</p>
        <p>Karen Richter, who lives across the street from the explosion site, said, ''I kind of thought it was something inside, because for a house to fall pancake style like that, it would have to be.''</p>
