        <p>Mike Bordick heard the rumblings in the fifth inning, when the Mets still had no hits off the San Francisco Giants right-hander Russ Ortiz. Let's break this thing up, the Mets said in their dugout, and that sounded like a good idea to Bordick.</p>
        <p>Leading off the bottom of the sixth inning, Bordick singled to left. But no other Mets followed his example. Not that it mattered, by then.</p>
        <p>Ortiz held the Mets to one hit over seven innings, and a slumbering Giants offense shattered Rick Reed in the sixth and Dennis Cook in the seventh. The Giants whipped the Mets, 11-1, last night at Shea Stadium to win the final game of a series that began with three Mets victories.</p>
        <p>With Atlanta beating San Diego, the Mets, who lost for only the fourth time in their last 20 games, fell two and a half games behind the Braves in the National League East.</p>
        <p>Not since the long-lost left-hander Bobby M. Jones imploded against Florida on July 4 -- more than 300 innings ago -- had the Mets allowed an opponent five runs in an inning. But the Giants rolled up five runs in the sixth and six in the seventh, after scoring just three times in their three losses over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Barry Bonds, 1 for 11 in the series before last night, went 4 for 4.</p>
        <p>''They did everything right,'' Reed said, ''and we couldn't do anything right.''</p>
        <p>Actually, Reed did nothing wrong for five innings. He left the bases loaded in the first, and was in a scoreless duel with Ortiz through the fifth. But when Reed's two-seam fastball had too much life and hit Jeff Kent, loading the bases in the sixth, a rout was about to break out.</p>
        <p>A sacrifice fly by J. T. Snow brought in the first run, and Reed faced Ellis Burks, whose grounder to short ended the first inning. This time, Burks's grounder made it through the hole between short and third for a run-scoring single, and Reed had begun aiming the ball.</p>
        <p>''When you try to make the perfect pitch, I know with me, the ball seems to get up in the strike zone, and that's what happened,'' Reed said. ''I would have loved to have gotten a ground-ball double play. It just wasn't meant to be.''</p>
        <p>Five runs scored before Reed got another out, and when Cook came on in the seventh, after the Mets stranded two runners in the sixth, the Giants overwhelmed him. Cook faced eight batters and retired only one. He walked two and allowed five hits and six runs. The final two runs came on a single by Ortiz, who had struck out three times against Reed.</p>
        <p>The six runs were the most a Mets reliever has allowed in a game this year, and Cook's earned run average jumped more than a run.</p>
        <p>''He hadn't been out there since last Wednesday, and it didn't look like he had his rhythm,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''He definitely didn't have his good fastball.''</p>
        <p>The truly mystifying performance was Ortiz's. The right-hander, who is among the National League leaders in walks, threw 57 balls in 115 pitches, but he flustered the Mets as usual. Ortiz, who earned first major league victory at Shea two years ago, is 4-0 with a 2.83 E.R.A. in five starts against the Mets.</p>
        <p>''He was spotting the ball where he wanted to spot it,'' said Jay Payton, whose home run off Aaron Fultz gave the Mets their run. ''If he just missed, we'd get a walk. He wasn't giving in to us. If we got ahead of him, he'd throw a 2-0 slider or a 2-1 slider instead of laying a cookie in there. When a guy's going well, he's making his pitches like that.''</p>
        <p>Bordick said: ''He was effectively wild. Those, sometimes, are the toughest guys to face. You never really sit on anything because he's in, out, up, down. He made his pitches when he needed to, though.''</p>
        <p>After Bordick led off the sixth with a single, he stole second as pinch-hitter Darryl Hamilton struck out. Benny Agbayani struck out looking, but Derek Bell walked and Edgardo Alfonzo got ahead in the count, 3-1.</p>
        <p>But Alfonzo swung under a fastball and sent it high above center field. He stared at the ground for a moment, frustrated at the missed opportunity, and trotted toward first as Marvin Benard caught the ball for the inning-ending out.</p>
        <p>That continued a troubling pattern for the Mets against Ortiz. They had at least one base runner in each of the first four innings, but three double plays helped Ortiz out of trouble.</p>
        <p>Ortiz said he was not thinking about trying to avoid a sweep; it was simply his day to pitch, ''and I was concentrating on my job.'' The Giants took all four games from the Mets at Pacific Bell Park in May, and they hold a 5-3 advantage over the Mets in a season series that may not be over.</p>
        <p>If the season ended today, the Mets would win the wild card and play the Giants, who lead the N.L. West, in the first round of the playoffs. The significance was not lost on Kent, the All-Star and former Met.</p>
        <p>''This could be a potential playoff situation, coming back here or them coming to our place,'' Kent said. ''We feel we're a better ball club than the Mets, but they're a team that could really bite you. You've got to watch yourself against the Mets.''</p>
