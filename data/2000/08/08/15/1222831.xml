        <p>Returning to action after a long absence because of back problems, 39-year-old Lothar Matthaus proved that he can still be one of the MetroStars' best players when he is healthy. Conversely, his teammates showed Matthaus in the 2-1 overtime victory over New England on Saturday that they are a good team, and his criticism of the club in the German news media early in the season may have been justified then, but is certainly not now.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars were 3-6 when Matthaus left in May to play for Germany in the European Championships. They will go into tomorrow night's game at Tampa Bay with a record of 14-9-2 and an 11-point lead in the Eastern Division. Quite a turnaround.</p>

        <p>Returning to action after a long absence because of back problems, 39-year-old Lothar Matthaus proved that he can still be one of the MetroStars' best players when he is healthy. Conversely, his teammates showed Matthaus in the 2-1 overtime victory over New England on Saturday that they are a good team, and his criticism of the club in the German news media early in the season may have been justified then, but is certainly not now.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars were 3-6 when Matthaus left in May to play for Germany in the European Championships. They will go into tomorrow night's game at Tampa Bay with a record of 14-9-2 and an 11-point lead in the Eastern Division. Quite a turnaround.</p>
        <p>''When we started, the team remembered last year,'' Matthaus said, referring to the club's 7-25 record in 1999. ''When the other team scored first, it was over. Now, the team has changed the mentality.''</p>
        <p>His point was illustrated in the game against New England.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars fell behind, 1-0, with three minutes to go in the game at Giants Stadium, but they came back in grand fashion on two goals by Adolfo Valencia, the second in overtime, for the victory.</p>
        <p>For his heroics, Valencia yesterday was named Major League Soccer's player of the week, the first member of the MetroStars to earn the honor this season. (Clint Mathis was selected as the league's player of the month for June.)</p>
        <p>The match tomorrow in Tampa, Fla., is between division leaders. The Mutiny leads the Central Division with a record of 14-10-2 and 44 points (the same number as the MetroStars) after an impressive 4-1 victory over Colorado on Saturday. The MetroStars and Tampa Bay are a point behind the Kansas City Wizards (13-6-6), who tied the Galaxy, 1-1, while playing a man down the entire second half in Los Angeles before a crowd of 33,112, most of whom were there to see a Mexican musical group perform after the game.</p>
        <p>D.C. United, the defending league champion, is now only a step away from failing to make the playoffs after a 1-0 loss in Dallas. Too many things have gone wrong for the three-time champions this season, one of which was the reacquisition of Raul Diaz Arce. General Manager Kevin Payne, who has directed United from the beginning, has taken the blame for the return of Diaz Arce, saying that it may turn out to be ''an extremely poor decision.''</p>
        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>The transfer market is set to be thrown into chaos as European regulators move toward abolishing FIFA's disputed transfer rules. The European Commission said over the weekend that it was preparing to outlaw the current system after FIFA failed to come forward with long-awaited proposals to meet its concerns that the existing system breaks European Union rules on fair competition and free movement of workers.</p>
        <p>FIFA, the sport's worldwide governing body, announced yesterday that it would move this week to head off European regulators' attempts to declare its transfer rules illegal. FIFA General Secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen will write to the European Union competition chief, Mario Monti, later this week with proposals aimed at avoiding the chaos that could result if Monti carries out his threat to abolish the current system.</p>
        <p>If the commission goes ahead and bans the current transfer system by the end of this year and FIFA fails to come up with an acceptable alternative, the transfer market could become a free-for-all. Players would no longer feel bound by their existing contracts and could turn to the courts to back them if the clubs tried to hold on to the players against their will.</p>
        <p>The commission opened its inquiry into the transfer rules in 1998 after receiving complaints from three clubs, players' organizations in Belgium and a lobby group campaigning for sport and liberty. The spiraling and arbitrary costs of buying players was highlighted last month when Real Madrid set a world record by paying archrival Barcelona $56.1 million for the Portuguese international Luis Figo.</p>
        <p>WORLD CUP QUALIFYING</p>
        <p>In South America, striker Marcelo Salas is set to play for Chile today against Brazil in a World Cup qualifying game. Salas sat out the last two matches for his country after he was ejected for fighting against Paraguay in June. Chile needs Salas desperately because it is sixth in the standing among South American nations. The top four finishers will qualify for the 2002 finals in Japan and South Korea. The fifth-place team will play the Oceania champion for a place in the finals.</p>
        <p>In another game today, Uruguay will face Colombia, which has picked up 4 points in its last two matches, in Peru and Ecuador, but has scored only one goal and has depended heavily on the heroics of its goalkeeper, Oscar Cordoba. Colombia has been so short on creativity that the former captain Carlos Valderrama, who plays for Tampa Bay in M.L.S., said last week that he was thinking of making an international comeback at the age of 38.</p>
        <p>Closer to home, Guatemala plays at Costa Rica and Mexico plays host to Canada today. In tomorrow's matches, the United States has a pivotal match against Barbados in Foxboro, Mass., Panama is at Trinidad and Tobago, St. Vincent travels to Honduras, and El Salvador plays at Jamaica.</p>
