        <p>Four years ago, Jimmy Carter conspicuously avoided the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. His relationship with the incumbent presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, was testy. Put bluntly, the two former Southern governors were both competitive and uneasy with each other. ''I've always had good relations with Vice President Gore,'' said Mr. Carter, picking his words carefully as he spoke over a cellular phone yesterday afternoon from a limousine as he rode to a reception.</p>
        <p>Jimmy Carter is back. And the delegates -- who gave him a prolonged standing ovation last night -- clearly adored him.</p>
        <p>On the first day of the Democratic convention, Mr. Carter was plainly delighted at the half-dozen press interviews and spontaneous bursts of applause from delegates in the sweltering streets of Los Angeles. Last night, he was honored with a five-minute film at the convention, before President Clinton delivered his farewell address as chief executive to the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Later in Mr. Clinton's speech, he went out of his way to pay tribute to Mr. Carter's record on human rights. ''Thank you, President Carter,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter was not planning to attend this year's convention. Four years ago he spent convention week on a ranch in Montana. ''At first Al Gore invited me and I told him I'd prefer not to come and make a big speech,'' Mr. Carter said. ''But then the idea came for a video presentation. It's been a very, very pleasant experience.''</p>
        <p>It has not been such a pleasant experience with Mr. Clinton, who has nonetheless tried to make amends. Last August, he flew to Atlanta to present the Medal of Freedom to Mr. Carter, an obvious effort by the White House to smooth the ties.</p>
        <p>The strains between Mr. Carter and Mr. Clinton were the result of the former president's intervention in some high-profile humanitarian and foreign issues, which collided with the administration.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Carter spoke warmly of Mr. Gore. ''Whenever there was a problem I called Al Gore,'' he said. ''I always called him. I've known him for 25 years. He's been my key friend and trusted ally.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's enthusiasm for Mr. Carter is not altogether altruistic. Although George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, is favored at the moment in numerous Southern states, Georgia could be a battleground. And Mr. Carter could be enlisted to campaign in the state for the Gore-Lieberman ticket.</p>
        <p>Passing Fund-Raising Torch</p>
        <p>No one in Hollywood has ever matched Lew Wasserman for his prowess in raising tens of millions of dollars for the Democratic Party since the days of John F. Kennedy. Now 87, and a bit frail, Mr. Wasserman hosted one more fund-raiser yesterday at his art-filled Beverly Hills home. Quietly, his associates said, Mr. Wasserman is seeking to pass off some of his political responsibilities to his grandson, Casey Wasserman. By the time the next Democratic convention rolls around, the younger Mr. Wasserman may have assumed some, or all, of his grandfather's fund-raising duties for charities and politicians.</p>
        <p>In contrast to younger Hollywood moguls, who crave media attention, Mr. Wasserman, the former chairman of MCA, does not give interviews and said that he has no interest in writing a book about his years in Hollywood because he has always viewed his roles -- as a talent agent and then executive -- as one of discretion and privacy. He once told a visitor that his one regret was not having accepted a top cabinet job with President Lyndon Johnson because his wife, Edie, did not want to leave Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The event given today by the Wassermans was for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Mr. Wasserman and his wife attend parties infrequently now -- although President Clinton is known to speak to him often over the phone. Although Mr. Wasserman is still actively engaged in Democratic politics, associates acknowledged that the fund-raiser today -- and the current Democratic convention in his hometown -- could mark a final chapter for Hollywood's most powerful political fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>New York Rivalry in West</p>
        <p>The New York delegation is hardly a vision of party unity, displaying the not-so-simmering rivalry between two likely gubernatorial candidates in 2002, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo, the United States housing secretary.</p>
        <p>Delegates close to Mr. McCall -- which seems to be the majority of them -- say that Mr. Cuomo, who is helping to run Al Gore's presidential campaign in New York, is using the Gore-New York party apparatus to help with his own contacts and political future.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo responded: ''How could I possibly be using the Gore apparatus if I'm not saying anything about the gubernatorial race -- and he is?'' Mr. Cuomo was referring to Mr. McCall and his energetic, public efforts in Los Angeles to line up support for his own race for governor.  Mr. McCall responded: 'If somebody wants to compete with me, I wish them luck.'' He added that he had briefly said hello to Mr. Cuomo at events here, but no more. ''I don't know what kind of a discussion we would have at this point,'' he said. 'I mean, what would we talk about?''</p>
        <p>Brunch With Barbra</p>
        <p>President Clinton arrived early and left late (and his wife and daughter arrived late and left early) at a Sunday brunch at Barbra Streisand's compound in Malibu that is said to have raised $10 million for the president's library -- the most impressive haul of the Clintons' prodigious fund-raising in Los Angeles this past weekend.</p>
        <p>The brunch was off limits to the press, although a small group of White House reporters stationed near the event tried to listen through the shrubbery. A mole at the brunch provided the following details:</p>
        <p>The 60 guests included such longtime Clinton fund-raisers as Bernard Schwartz, the chairman of the Loral Space and Communications Corporation, the company whose export of satellite technology to China attracted the scrutiny of Justice Department investigators; Robert Johnson, the chairman of Black Entertainment Television Holdings; Alan Patricof, the chairman of Patricof &amp; Company Ventures, a venture capital firm; and Smith Bagley, the grandson of the tobacco magnate R. J. Reynolds. Mr. Bagley's wife, Elizabeth, was the Clinton administration's ambassador to Portugal until last year.</p>
        <p>Other than Ms. Streisand and her husband, James Brolin, there were no Hollywood celebrities in evidence.</p>
        <p>Guests started arriving at noon for cocktails near Ms. Streisand's garden of roses overlooking the Pacific. The president arrived around 12:30 p.m., met privately with Ms. Streisand and Mr. Brolin, then schmoozed with guests. Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea Clinton arrived some time later, got a lengthy tour from Ms. Streisand of her rooms filled with quilts and American folk art, then sat down to an outdoor buffet. Both the president and first lady made remarks. Terry McAuliffe, the Clintons' chief fund-raiser, started off the speeches, calling Ms. Streisand ''the greatest artist of all time.''</p>
