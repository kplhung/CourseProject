        <p>The financier George Soros, as promised, sold his stake in a number of technology stocks in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>A dismal April had left his flagship Quantum Fund down 20 percent for the year and led to the departure of his two top fund managers.</p>
        <p>Soros Fund Management's stake in domestic equities shrank to about a fourth its size from the end of March to the end of June, to about $2 billion from over $8 billion -- a $6 billion change -- according to a document filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Soros said after April's market slide that he would abandon many of the high-risk strategies that had made him a billionaire.</p>
        <p>Where did the $6 billion go? Some was withdrawn by investors, some was lost to choppy markets and some was transferred into other strategies. By the end of June, Soros Fund Management's overall assets stood at $10.7 billion, down from $14.4 billion at the end of April and $22 billion in August of 1998.</p>
        <p>Among the positions Soros sold were Ask Jeeves, Digex, DoubleClick, Epiphany, Informix, Qualcomm, Qwest Communications and SDL.</p>
