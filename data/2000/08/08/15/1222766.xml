        <p>Following is an excerpt from remarks last night by Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>I am so proud to stand here at this extraordinary moment, the most peaceful, prosperous, promising time in our nation's history.</p>
        <p>Now, how can we continue America's progress? By electing Al Gore and Joe Lieberman the next president and vice president of the United States.</p>
        <p>You know, even before he was vice president, I admired Al for his leadership in the Senate, his understanding of the future, his pioneering efforts to fight environmental threats that affected our children, his work with Tipper to promote responsible parenting -- and what great parents the two of them are.</p>
        <p>I've watched him as Bill's trusted partner in the White House. Together, they made the hard decisions to renew our nation's economy and our national spirit; to advance democracy and defend freedom around the world. And I can't wait until we watch Al Gore take the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2001.</p>
        <p>And standing next to him will be his wonderful wife and my dear friend, who inspires us through her work for the homeless and her advocacy on behalf of mental health. Tipper Gore will make a great first lady.</p>
        <p>And the country has seen again Al Gore's leadership in his choice of Joe Lieberman.</p>
        <p>I first met Joe 30 years ago when Bill and I were law students. We saw then what America sees now: a person of uncommon wisdom and integrity. I admire Joe's work to reduce the violence in our media. And I appreciate his steadfast support for a woman's right to choose.</p>
        <p>And with him is his remarkable wife, Hadassah, the immigrant daughter of Holocaust survivors. Their story tells our children that in America, no dream is beyond our reach.</p>
        <p>You know, in 1992, Bill and Al promised to put people first. That simply meant that when people live up to their responsibilities, we ought to live up to ours and give them the tools and opportunities they need to build better lives. That's the basic bargain at the heart of the American dream.</p>
        <p>From a stronger economy to more Americans attending college to a cleaner environment, Bill Clinton and Al Gore have put people first. And not only that, they put children first.</p>
        <p>More children lifted out of poverty.</p>
        <p>More children receiving Head Start, child care and after-school care.</p>
        <p>More children than ever getting immunized against disease.</p>
        <p>More children whose parents can take family and medical leave to care for them.</p>
        <p>And more neglected and abused foster children being adopted into loving, permanent homes.</p>
        <p>Children like Dianna, who came to a White House ceremony I held spotlighting the needs of children in foster care. Just 12 years old, not much younger than Chelsea at the time, she spent most of her life moving from house to house. She was so shy she could barely look up as she spoke of her longing for a home and family of her own.</p>
        <p>As I listened, I thought, ''How can we let any child grow up in our country without a secure and loving home?''</p>
        <p>I worked with a bipartisan coalition to help double the number of foster children adopted.</p>
