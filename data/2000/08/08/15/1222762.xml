        <p>With a bit of stagecraft intended to take some attention away from his opponent in the Senate race, Representative Rick A. Lazio signed a ''pact'' yesterday that calls on Hillary Rodham Clinton to join him in renouncing unregulated campaign contributions.</p>
        <p>The Republican congressman, seeking to counter the publicity over Mrs. Clinton's speech at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles last night, held a news conference in the Planet Hollywood restaurant in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio took out a document labeled ''New York Freedom From Soft Money Pact,'' a promise to stay clear of soft money if Mrs. Clinton does the same. He signed it as television cameras rolled, and an assistant said it would be delivered to Mrs. Clinton's campaign office in New York and sent by overnight mail to her hotel in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>In response, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, wrote a letter to Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, that said Mrs. Clinton would take up the challenge only if Mr. Lazio secures written promises that independent political organizations that support his campaign would cease negative advertising and other attacks against her. Mr. de Blasio also said Mr. Lazio would have to release his income tax returns, something he has repeatedly promised to do this summer. President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton released their tax return in April.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio had made a similar pledge to abandon soft money 10 days ago on Long Island while campaigning with Senator John McCain of Arizona. Soft money, largely unregulated sums principally raised by political party committees and outside groups, is not supposed to be used to promote campaigns directly but often manages to do just that through artfully produced advertising.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has two soft money accounts, operated jointly with outside organizations, and has raised more than $1 million in soft money. Mr. Lazio has raised none, his advisers said. Independent groups have raised money and sponsored advertising on behalf of both candidates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio sought to intertwine campaign finance reform with another favored theme, the trustworthiness of Mrs. Clinton, by noting she made a similar pledge in May. Mr. Lazio demurred then, and yesterday explained he could not possibly have accepted such a challenge when Mrs. Clinton and her supporters had already raised millions of dollars in soft money.</p>
        <p>The pact proposed by Mr. Lazio calls on the candidates to close all soft money accounts -- Mr. Lazio has none -- and refund the remaining money or donate it to charity. It asks the candidates not to open any new soft money accounts during the campaign and calls on outside groups to cease advertisements on behalf of the candidates, or attacking them.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued after he spoke to reporters, Mr. Lazio also offered to shut down his Friends of Rick Lazio state political action committee, which he finances but says is not directly related to his Senate campaign and does not use soft money. Mrs. Clinton's staff had called it a de facto soft-money committee.</p>
        <p>Shortly before Mr. Lazio arrived at the news conference, a Democratic Party operative dressed as Uncle Sam began shouting for Mr. Lazio to release his tax returns.</p>
        <p>Michael Marr, a spokesman for the congressman, wrapped his arm around the man's neck and pulled him away from reporters as the police and restaurant personnel moved in to hustle him out.</p>
