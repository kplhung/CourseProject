        <p>The White House has touched off a furor in the rarified world of archaeology by announcing the appointmentof Shelby White, a wealthy New York collector of antiquities, to a seat on a government committee formed to help combat illicit international trade in such objects.</p>
        <p>Ms. White, who was named to the panel last week, is known to many archaeologists as the wife of the financier Leon Levy, who shares her passion for antiquities and is an avid collector himself.</p>
        <p>The couple, owners of one of world's finest private collections of classical artifacts, have a reputation for generosity in sponsoring archaeological fieldwork, research and publication. But as collectors they have frequently stirred anger among archaeologists. While most collectors are chiefly interested in owning objects, archaeologists generally focus on the preservation of archaeological sites.</p>
        <p>Collectors and archaeologists are also often at odds over the issue of theft. Archaeologists generally take the position that collectors encourage illegal traffic by creating a market for antiquities. But reputable collectors insist that they take pains to check the provenance of objects they acquire.</p>
        <p>Among those who wrote to President Clinton on Ms. White's behalf were Katherine Lee Reid, president of the Association of Art Museum Directors and director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, who called her ''uniquely qualified''; and Glen W. Bowersock, an internationally respected professor of ancient history at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, who said she would make ''an admirable representative of the nonprofessional community of collectors.''</p>
        <p>But such sentiments are far from unanimous. ''It's like putting a fox in charge of the chicken coop,'' Nancy Wilkie, president of the 11,500-member Archaeological Institute of America, said of the appointment. ''Shelby White is known to everyone in the archaeology community as a voracious collector who seems to show no concern for protecting our heritage.''</p>
        <p>''We lobbied against her appointment last June, and we thought it was dead,'' Ms. Wilkie said.</p>
        <p>Malcolm Bell, a professor of art history and archaeology at the University of Virginia who has studied the records of the collection of Ms. White and Mr. Levy, asked, ''How can she serve on this committee when she is opposed to the idea that caused the committee to be formed?''</p>
        <p>Ms. White, who adamantly insists that her critics have not been able to prove that she owns looted art, said that her unsalaried appointment was consistent with the legislation that created the committee.</p>
        <p>''The original idea was to have a representative body of people -- scholars, collectors, dealers and lay people -- to reach balanced decisions that would better aid the president and the secretary of state as to what can be brought into the country and what can't,'' she said, adding that such decisions should not be left only to professionals.</p>
        <p>Tony Bullock, chief of staff for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is Ms. White's sponsor for the job, said that the lobbying effort against her by the Archaeological Institute had backfired.</p>
        <p>''It prompted 20 to 30 carefully reasoned letters saying that Shelby White is exactly the sort of person who belongs on the committee,'' Mr. Bullock said. ''The original legislation, which was drafted by Senator Moynihan, wasn't aimed at creating a panel of people who agreed about everything. It envisioned passionate disagreements. That is its strength.''</p>
        <p>One of the letter writers supporting Ms. White's appointment, James Cuno, director of the Harvard Art Museums, acknowledged that her collecting practices had drawn criticism. But he said that he regarded Ms. White and Mr. Levy as ''public collectors who make every effort to share their collections with the public.''</p>
        <p>Speaking for herself, Ms. White said she was eager to serve on the panel, officially known as the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, ''to be a voice for the collecting community.''</p>
        <p>''I've had broad experience as a collector and archaeologist,'' she said. ''I'm aware of the various archaeological sites. I go on digs every summer. I'm involved in publication in the field. I serve on the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and I want to be helpful.''</p>
        <p>On occasion Ms. White and Mr. Levy have been hard pressed to defend their acquisitions. About seven years ago, for example, they bought a dazzling second-century bronze and silver miniature model of a leopard, one in a collection of 16 such objects that they own that are suspected of having been surreptitiously removed from Roman ruins in Icklingham, England.</p>
        <p>After claimants to the property threatened to sue for the recovery of the items, which were considered to be among the most important archaeological discoveries in the last 50 years, a settlement was reached in which Ms. White and Mr. Levy bequeathed all 16 objects to the British Museum.</p>
        <p>The 11-member government committee was established in 1983, in response to widespread concern about the looting of archaeological sites in poor countries like Guatamala and Peru. Composed of scholars, dealers, collectors and representatives of the public, its mandate is to provide the president with recommendations on archaeological and ethnographic materials that, if pillaged, would jeopardize a country's cultural patrimony.</p>
        <p>If the president (or in practice, the State Department) is convinced that such a danger exists, importation of cultural articles from that country may be restricted.</p>
        <p>Establishment of the committee -- part of United States adherence to a 1970 Unesco convention -- was stalled in Congress for more than a decade because of pressure from the Art Dealers Association and other groups and from legislators like Senator Moynihan, who argued that the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, as set up in the 1983 implementing bill, was too narrowly based to be workable.</p>
        <p>Senator Moynihan broke the deadlock with compromise legislation that included the broadening of the committee's membership, although many advocates for a more powerful committee maintained that his solution was unnecessarily weak.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the committee has  in recent years successfully urged the establishment of import restrictions on antiquities from El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Mali and Canada, and on cultural property from Cyprus and Cambodia.</p>
        <p>The criticism of the appointment of Ms. White seems unlikely to fade away soon. Claire Lyons, a former vice president of the Archaeological Institute of America who specialized in professional responsibility and ethics, said: ''I'm deeply concerned about this intended appointment. People who buy art from countries where there is a serious threat of looting get caught in a conflict of interest that undermines the faith of the public in the committee.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilkie pointed to another example of controversial art in Ms. Shelby's collection. ''She bought the top half of a Heracles statue, the bottom half of which is in the Anatalya Museum,'' on the southern coast of Turkey, Ms. Wilkie said. ''Everybody knows the two pieces fit together, and that her half was looted, but she says there is no proof of that and at the same time has never allowed plaster casts to be made which would settle the matter.''</p>
        <p>Ms. White said that she and Mr. Levy had long ago given the piece to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and that she had offered to have plaster casts of the statue made but that no one was interested.</p>
        <p>She added that discovering pieces of antiquities that appear to have been broken apart and that wound up in separate collections was quite common. ''But that's no reason to return a piece,'' she added.</p>
        <p>She said she viewed the criticism of her appointment as part of a bigger dispute. ''I don't think this is a personal attack because none of these people have ever met me,'' she said. ''I serve on a lot of boards like the Met Museum. I think it's a attack on them.''</p>
