        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Samuel G. Freedman (Op-Ed, Aug. 8) implies that Modern Orthodox Jews alone among the Orthodox see value in engaging with the larger society. In fact, Orthodoxy's more rigorously observant wing -- known as haredim, Hebrew for fervently dedicated to God -- is hardly disengaged from the challenges of contemporary life.</p>
        <p>Haredi community activists, academics and business leaders abound, haredi Jews vote in high percentages, and Agudath Israel of America, a group whose constituents include haredim and others, including Joseph I.

        <p>Besides, haredi Jews who choose more insular lives can hardly be faulted for doing what they can to protect themselves from the cultural corruption that Senator Lieberman has so consistently and laudably condemned.
