        <p>Re ''Uniting Jerusalem,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Aug. 11): After visiting Jerusalem two weeks ago, after seeing the already divided nature of the communities there and after watching an Israeli soldier walk through the Church of the Holy Sepulcher (the holiest of the Christian shrines) with his automatic weapon at his side, I, too, concluded that the only real peace in this part of the world will include the political division of the city.</p>
        <p>How can it be that the citizens of a country founded on religious principles cannot find the spiritual awareness and strength to rally around a leader who is leading them toward such a solution?</p>

        <p>How can it be that the citizens of a country founded on religious principles cannot find the spiritual awareness and strength to rally around a leader who is leading them toward such a solution?</p>
        <p>The only alternative would be to place this most spiritual of cities under international jurisdiction, but I doubt that any of the parties directly involved would ever accept this remedy.</p>
