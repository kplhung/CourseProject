        <p>Four years after Trans World Airlines Flight 800 exploded off the coast of Long Island, the National Transportation Safety Board is preparing to approve an unusual final report on the crash, one that will identify only the penultimate cause.</p>
        <p>The agency is working on a 700-page report, far longer than typical for a major crash, that investigators say contains unusual detail, documenting an ambitious foray into basic science.</p>
        <p>But the report does not tell what the public most wants to know: the source of ignition for the explosion in the center fuel tank, when the Boeing 747 was about 11 minutes out of Kennedy International Airport on its way to Paris on July 17, 1996. As the plane climbed to 13,700 feet the fuel tank explosion ripped it apart, chopping off the front of the plane as if with a guillotine. All 230 people aboard were killed.</p>
        <p>The investigation has been mammoth. Searchers retrieved 95 percent of the 170-ton aircraft from the ocean floor and reconstructed a 90-foot-long section. ''It's the most intensely investigated accident in aviation history,'' said Beth Erickson, director of aircraft certification at the Federal Aviation Administration, which has been deeply involved.</p>
        <p>Even with no certainty about the source of ignition, the accident has set off a wide review of airplane design and operating practices. That review found troubling conditions on several varieties of jets, which fly about 30 percent of the time with an atmosphere in their center tanks that will support combustion. The findings seem likely to result in major changes, aviation regulators say, that will reduce the amount of time that fuel tanks have an atmosphere that will support fire or explosion.</p>
        <p>After analysis of the damage and the pattern in which debris fell convinced researchers that the cause was the explosion of the center fuel tank, they desperately tried to figure out where in the tank the blast originated. They built a quarter-scale model of the tank, complete with  baffles and girders, and filled it with propane gas. Then they tried igniting the gas from various parts of the tank to see whether they could create a pressure wave like the one they deduced, from the damage pattern, must have occurred on the plane.</p>
        <p>They could not. ''There were just too many variables,'' one investigator said. Some people involved said that effort was doomed from the start, and that it needlessly delayed the safety board's effort to reach a conclusion.</p>
        <p>The board spent months on other possibilities. One was that a pipe inside the tank, filled with fuel under pressure, sprang a leak and created a spray, which built up a static charge. But the investigators did not find evidence of a failure of the parts that prevent static buildup.</p>
        <p>A scavenge pump that sucks out the last dregs of fuel from the center tank remains a suspect, even though it is designed to avoid introducing a spark, but it was never found. Likewise, suspect parts of the fuel quantity indicating system are missing.</p>
        <p>Investigators have also delved deep into fuel chemistry, including how sulfur in the fuel can combine with copper or silver from wiring to form deposits on electrical connectors that can cause short circuits and sparks. And they have conducted experiments with an airplane in flight to measure the amount of time that  the air space above the fuel in a tank has air and fuel vapors in a proportion that will allow combustion.</p>
        <p>Some safety experts are saying that the work to identify a variety of potential problems and to make improvements in many systems will be more vital to safety than finding the one cause of the Flight 800 explosion. ''How important is it whether it was the fuel gauge wiring, the scavenge pump or some other wiring?'' one former board official asked. ''If we knew it was one, would we exclude the other two? No.''</p>
        <p>An investigator still with the board, in a separate conversation, said fixing one specific source of ignition would not do enough to prevent future explosions.</p>
        <p>''The whole drift of our work now is that this is the wrong tack to take,'' he said. ''Even if we found five or six ignition sources, there could be more; we've got to go toward making the tank less explosive. When this is done, we will have extracted the safety value from this crash.''</p>
        <p>At the Boeing Company, officials also said that failure to zero in on one cause was not a detriment to safety.</p>
        <p>''We've thrown a blanket over everything,'' said Ron Hinderberger,  the director of airplane safety at Boeing's Commercial Airplanes Group unit, ''and we've found other opportunities in the design, other opportunities in the maintenance, to enhance the safety of the fuel system.''</p>
        <p>The report is different for another reason: it is concerned not only with what caused the crash, but also what didn't. It dwells heavily on ruling out a bomb or missile, both subjects of fevered speculation in the weeks following the crash.</p>
        <p>As part of the effort to create an airtight case for a mechanical failure, the Pentagon test-fired Stinger missiles off the coast of Florida so investigators could see exactly what those would look like from shore, to compare the results with witness reports. Boeing has told the board that there was no evidence of a bomb or missile damage.</p>
        <p>The board is scheduled to meet on Aug. 22 and 23, in a new multimedia hearing room built partly in anticipation of this event, to discuss the staff report on the crash, probably haggle over some details and then approve it and make some additional recommendations. Those may include advice to the F.A.A. and aircraft manufacturers, notably Boeing, to review the design of their jets, people familiar with the report said. The board plans to broadcast the meeting live on its Web site, www.ntsb.gov, and will post the report there in a few months.</p>
        <p>Even if no ultimate cause is determined, the report, combined with recommendations that the safety board issued in April 1998 and actions recommended by Boeing or ordered by the F.A.A., are a sort of a cure, aviation experts say.</p>
        <p>''The actions we've taken are the most sweeping and unprecedented, and broadest in scope, that we've ever engaged in at the F.A.A.,'' Ms. Erickson said. Her agency has issued 37 directives to aircraft operators, and is developing three more.  One requires a flame arrestor on the scavenge pump. Other orders focus on wiring changes in the plane.</p>
        <p>Boeing has recommended that airplanes sitting for long periods on hot days use portable carts that pump cool air instead of their air-conditioners, which are next to the center tanks.</p>
        <p>A more ambitious idea, injecting nitrogen gas into the tanks when the planes are on the ground, to reduce the amount of oxygen, is under development.</p>
