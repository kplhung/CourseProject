        <p>The long-awaited dance between protesters and the police turned into a violent confrontation tonight when some in the audience at a concert  outside the Staples Center threw rocks and bottles at officers, who responded by firing rubber-coated bullets and pepper spray at the demonstrators and moved in on horseback to disperse them.</p>
        <p>The concert of protest itself, by the hard-rock, hip-hop band Rage Against the Machine, was peaceful enough, staged just outside the center in a fenced-off spot from which the authorities had tried to bar demonstrators until a federal judge intervened. But once the concert was over, some in the crowd threw the bottles and rocks over a high-security fence at police officers on the other side.</p>

        <p>The long-awaited dance between protesters and the police turned into a violent confrontation tonight when some in the audience at a concert  outside the Staples Center threw rocks and bottles at officers, who responded by firing rubber-coated bullets and pepper spray at the demonstrators and moved in on horseback to disperse them.</p>
        <p>The concert of protest itself, by the hard-rock, hip-hop band Rage Against the Machine, was peaceful enough, staged just outside the center in a fenced-off spot from which the authorities had tried to bar demonstrators until a federal judge intervened. But once the concert was over, some in the crowd threw the bottles and rocks over a high-security fence at police officers on the other side.</p>
        <p>When the demonstrators -- a few hundred people among a crowd of several thousand -- refused to disperse, the police declared them an illegal assembly and began firing rubber-coated bullets and using mounted officers to force them away from the Staples Center, site of the Democratic National Convention, and down a nearby street.</p>
        <p>But delegates and journalists streaming out of the arena found  their way blocked.</p>
        <p>''This is really a tragedy; I'm disgusted,'' said a man who identified himself as a stockbroker from the Venice district and would give his name only as Johnny. He was holding two rubber bullets that he said the police had fired at him.</p>
        <p>Shortly before the violence, in which no serious injuries were initially reported, what the police described as a bomb threat forced the evacuation of nearby Patriotic Hall,  the scene of the so-called shadow convention and headquarters for various alternative-media outlets. The police said they were investigating a report of a bomb in a van parked behind the building. But protesters called that a ruse to break them up, and the conservative commentator Arianna Huffington, an organizer of the shadow gathering, led her followers down the street in a demonstration.</p>
        <p>Those two episodes concluded a largely peaceful if occasionally tense day in which hundreds of marchers -- and then a few thousand of them --  plied their way back and forth between the Staples Center and Pershing Square, a broad public plaza about a dozen blocks away.</p>
        <p>The official theme of the protesters' day was ''Human Need, Not Corporate Greed,'' but the placards, banners, puppets and armbands that swirled through the usually sterile streets of downtown Los Angeles embraced a dizzying range of causes and concerns. Demonstrators were on hand to protest everything from Vice President Al Gore's investments in an oil company that plans to drill near a Colombian Indian reserve to the influence of the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>''Life Is Not a Commodity,'' read one banner. Another said, ''Al Gore = Corporate Eichmann.'' Perhaps the bleakest placard: ''All Government Is Bad.''</p>
        <p>The morning began with a rally in Pershing Square, featuring the singer Bonnie Raitt, to protest Mr. Gore's family holdings in the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, which has rights to conduct exploratory drilling a few miles outside the legal boundaries of the U'wa Indian reserve in Colombia. Environmental groups have urged Mr. Gore to divest his family of the stock, worth some $500,000.</p>
        <p>''As far as I'm concerned, the only drug coming out of Colombia is oil,'' said Ms. Raitt, who with John Densmore, former drummer for the Doors, sang the old Buffalo Springfield song ''For What It's Worth.'' The crowd then headed to the Staples Center, where it greeted some delegates arriving early, including a Baltimore city councilman, Keiffer J. Mitchell Jr.</p>
        <p>''I came in early just to walk around and see what it's all about,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''The Democratic Party and the Republican Party may not address everything, but this shows that here in the United States of America we can speak out on any issue without fear of retaliation or harm.''</p>
        <p>That was not how some protesters saw it just a few moments later, after they had turned back toward Pershing Square and tried to block traffic at the intersection of Sixth and Flower Streets. After ignoring bullhorn warnings to disperse, nine  demonstrators were arrested.</p>
        <p>The police moved the remaining demonstrators back to Pershing Square, where perhaps 2,000 people were gathered and still more rallies were scheduled. Just as the group reached the southwestern corner of the square, there was another tense few minutes as demonstrators again stood in the middle of an intersection, this one adjoining the grand old Biltmore Hotel, where top Democrats and aides to Mr. Gore are staying.</p>
        <p>''This has been declared an unlawful assembly,'' the police commander on the scene warned through a loudspeaker, his voice barely audible over the din of police helicopters circling overhead, as officers brandished tear-gas guns. ''We need to clear the intersection.''</p>
        <p>At that, demonstrators, with bullhorns of their own, answered back by invoking the Constitution and the First Amendment, shouting among other things that ''the right of the people to peacefully assemble shall not be abridged.'' Eventually the protesters retreated, and traffic began flowing again.</p>
