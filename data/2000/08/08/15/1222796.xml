        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I seem to be the exception to what is described as a ''universal biological rule'' as I am an adult over 50 who does not need reading glasses to read the newspaper (''Reading Glasses, as Inevitable as Death and Taxes. Or Are They?'' Aug. 8).</p>
        <p>In my case it would be bifocals, as I have been extremely nearsighted since childhood.</p>
        <p>My prescription has been stable since at least 1977, confirmed last year by my admiring optometrist, and I will turn 54 in September.</p>
        <p>I am reading the paper this evening, comfortably held at about 14 inches from my face, with my single focal glasses.</p>
        <p>I assure you that I see every letter clearly, and resent the insinuation that I rely upon ''blur interpretation.''</p>
