        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Negatives of Recycling in New York,'' by John Tierney (Big City column, Aug. 8): A decade ago little or no infrastructure existed in New York City to process the recyclables proposed for collection under Local Law 19 of 1989, particularly in the quantities that would be sorted out by residents only a few years later.</p>
        <p>As in the development of any new industry, upfront costs have exceeded those that occur when stasis is finally achieved. Mr. Tierney's example about the personal toll exacted for participating in the recycling program is equivalent to stating that his daily walk to the subway is a form of subsidy to the Transit Authority because the authority fails to pick him up at his doorstep. While the example may be appealing as rhetoric, it fails to provide any compelling evidence to support his underlying resentment toward recycling.</p>
