        <p>It is the kind of most-wanted list that could make more than a few car owners sympathize with the criminal element: the 21 New Yorkers who owe the most in unpaid parking tickets.</p>
        <p>That sympathy might fade, however, with the revelation of the grand totals. The city's Department of Finance, as part of a new strategy of trying to pressure parking-ticket scofflaws into paying up, yesterday revealed the names, the number of tickets they have ignored and the amount of their fines. According to the list, illegal parker No. 1 is Charles Rhodes, whose last known address was Gravesend, Brooklyn, who owes $66,995 for 499 unpaid parking tickets. In other words, just about enough to buy a new, top-of-the-line Range Rover with leather seats and heated side mirrors.</p>

        <p>It is the kind of most-wanted list that could make more than a few car owners sympathize with the criminal element: the 21 New Yorkers who owe the most in unpaid parking tickets.</p>
        <p>That sympathy might fade, however, with the revelation of the grand totals. The city's Department of Finance, as part of a new strategy of trying to pressure parking-ticket scofflaws into paying up, yesterday revealed the names, the number of tickets they have ignored and the amount of their fines. According to the list, illegal parker No. 1 is Charles Rhodes, whose last known address was Gravesend, Brooklyn, who owes $66,995 for 499 unpaid parking tickets. In other words, just about enough to buy a new, top-of-the-line Range Rover with leather seats and heated side mirrors.</p>
        <p>The four vehicles on whose windshields Mr. Rhodes accumulated the tickets were not exactly of that caliber, it appears. Officials with the Finance Department said yesterday that when they seized one of Mr. Rhodes's cars recently and auctioned it to pay off his debts, the car  brought in all of $240, minus towing, storage and auction fees.</p>
        <p>''Our primary objective is not to embarrass these people, though the posting of the names today will undoubtedly be embarrassing,'' said Jeffrey Shear, the department's deputy assistant commissioner for collections. ''The purpose is to get them to pay the tickets.''</p>
        <p>City officials said that releasing the names and listing them on the Finance Department's Internet site, http://nyc.gov/html/dof/html /parkingdelinq.html, was part of a program that began last year, when the department decided to post the names of major business tax debtors on the Web. Since the business names were posted, officials said, the city has collected $4.1 million in outstanding taxes.</p>
        <p>Officials revealed little information yesterday about the 21 parking scofflaws -- who collectively owe $742,490 on 5,809 tickets stretching back eight years, a total that includes late fees and 9 percent annual interest charged to each driver.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Shear did some additional research on Mr. Rhodes and found that he collected all of his tickets in 18 months -- March 1997 to August 1998. As with many of the other top scofflaws, Mr. Rhodes has given city officials little opportunity to seize other assets, like bank accounts or wages, to pay his parking tickets. ''It's very hard to answer the question of whether there is any intent to evade,'' Mr. Shear said. ''If people don't open bank accounts and keep their cash in the mattress, you really can't say what their intent is for doing that.''</p>
        <p>A man who answered the telephone yesterday at the address provided by the city for Mr. Rhodes said that he did not live there anymore and had moved to New Jersey. The man, who would not give his name, said he thought Mr. Rhodes was a truck driver. ''I don't know where he is now,'' the man said.</p>
        <p>Nor does the city, apparently. Mr. Rhodes has no New York State driver's license. In October 1996, he got a New Jersey license, which lists his address as 541 Lambert Street in Trenton. The problem? In Trenton, there is no such address.</p>
