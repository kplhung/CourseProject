        <p>In its second attempt to buy a production base in North America, the Finnish paper and lumber giant UPM-Kymmene Corporation has agreed to buy Canada's struggling Repap Enterprises for 20 Canadian cents a share, a total of 160 million Canadian dollars ($110 million). Repap's directors and largest shareholders have accepted the offer, which is twice the recent trading price. The assumption of Repap's debt and the cost of good will puts the total value of the purchase at 1.35 billion Canadian dollars ($918 million). In May, the Helsinki company failed with a $5.8 billion for Champion International Corporation. Repap is one-tenth the size of Champion, but its modern coated paper mill in New Brunswick ''will enable UPM-Kymmene to better serve its North American customers,'' said Juha Niemela, the company's president.</p>
