        <p>Renee Orin, an actress and singer known for her roles in Broadway musicals, died on Sunday in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 73 and lived in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>She had lymphoma, said her husband, Albert Hague, a Tony-winning composer of Broadway musicals.</p>
        <p>Ms. Orin made her Broadway debut in the 1955 musical ''Plain and Fancy,'' which her husband composed. Her Broadway credits also  include ''Finian's Rainbow.''</p>
        <p>She was called ''a singer with a lovely voice and a charming, ingratiating personality,'' by the jazz critic John S. Wilson in a 1976 review in The New York Times of a program of songs sung by her and her husband at the Ballroom nightclub.</p>
        <p>Born in Slatington, Pa., she received a bachelor's degree in drama from Carnegie Tech.</p>
        <p>Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Janet Hague of Portland, Ore., and a son, Andrew Hague of Manhattan.</p>
