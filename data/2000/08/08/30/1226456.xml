        <p>Letter from ACLU executive director Ira Glasser, commenting on August 28 article, disputes assertions by Sen Joseph Lieberman on morality and religion in public and private life</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's assertion, in a speech in Detroit, that morality cannot be maintained without religion and a belief in God not only threatens the freedom of religion of atheists, it is also demonstrably untrue (news article, Aug. 28).</p>
        <p>For generations in this country, some Southerners who believed in God and devoutly attended church went out during the week and lynched African-Americans. Many who didn't participate directly in lynching nonetheless helped maintain Jim Crow laws that subjugated and brutalized black citizens for more than a century after slavery was abolished.</p>

        <p>Many who worked tirelessly to end racial segregation did not believe in God or kept their religious beliefs to themselves.</p>
        <p>There is no easy correlation between public piety and civic morality, and Mr. Lieberman does us all a disservice when he suggests otherwise.</p>
