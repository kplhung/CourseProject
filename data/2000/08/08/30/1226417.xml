        <p>Widely criticized and repeatedly sued, the city's child welfare agency is doing a better job investigating child abuse and neglect complaints, a new state report has found.</p>
        <p>The inquiry, the first of three required by an agreement settling a 1995 class-action lawsuit against the city and state child welfare agencies, looked almost exclusively at whether the city's Administration for Children's Services has complied with state rules and regulations governing child protective services.</p>
        <p>Compliance, child welfare experts say, is a necessary though not necessarily sufficient element in running an effective child welfare agency. In other words, timely investigations are an important safeguard, but timeliness may not say much about whether caseworkers are making the right decisions.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, you can't capture everything by looking at compliance with the regulations,'' said Steve Cohen, staff director of the Special Child Welfare Advisory Panel, an independent committee established two years ago to review and recommend changes for the agency.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the state's findings are good news for the city, so much so that the commissioner, Nicholas Scoppetta, took the unusual step of releasing comments on the report even before it was issued by the State Office of Children and Family Services. Mr. Scoppetta noted that the review outlined ''significant improvements'' in several areas.</p>
        <p>According to state law, after a complaint is made to the state child abuse hot line, the city agency is required to try to contact the family within 24 hours. It is required to make face-to-face contact within 48 hours, and within 7 days it is to assess whether a child is in danger.</p>
        <p>The report, which compares the findings of an investigation earlier this year with two earlier reviews, found significant improvements in the timeliness of investigations. The city agency contacted a parent or guardian accused of abuse or neglect within 24 hours 91 percent of the time, compared with 84 percent in a 1996-97 review. In 88 percent of the 476 cases reviewed, the 7-day safety assessment was based on enough information to decide whether a child was in imminent danger.</p>
        <p>However, among those cases concerning a child already in city custody, the results were not as good. Contact was made within 24 hours 92 percent of the time, compared with 97 percent in the 1996-97 review.</p>
        <p>Marcia Robinson Lowry, executive director of Children's Rights Inc., which brought the lawsuit that led to the inquiries, had praise yesterday for the improvements in timely investigations. Still, Ms. Lowry said her review of child fatality reports showed serious shortcomings in the way cases were investigated, even though deaths have declined in recent years.</p>
