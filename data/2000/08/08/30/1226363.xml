        <p>While hanging out with his teenage son at a recent San Diego Chargers practice, Alan Ensley, a fan of the team, spoke for a city still waiting for its football savior.</p>
        <p>''This is the year, Ryan,'' said Ensley, 40, an air traffic controller at San Diego International Airport. ''Go, buddy!''</p>
        <p>Ryan Leaf did not acknowledge the words of encouragement. He kept lobbing the ball to a teammate, focusing on the day's work, striving to meet a challenge he could never have imagined would be this formidable. San Diego's National Football League franchise, which went from the Super Bowl in 1995 to a 4-12 record three seasons later, is not the only thing that needs to be saved. Leaf's reputation needs to be saved, too.</p>
        <p>Leaf is lucky. He will get another chance. With an impressive preseason this year -- 40 of 63 for 447 yards and 3 touchdowns -- the 6-foot-5-inch Leaf beat out the incumbent quarterback, Jim Harbaugh, to earn the starting job for the Chargers, who open the season Sunday at Oakland.</p>
        <p>At 24, he will again try to be the player worthy of the substantial sacrifice San Diego made -- giving up two No. 1 draft picks, a No. 2 pick, the wide receiver/kick returner Eric Metcalf and linebacker Patrick Sapp -- to move up one position and select him with the second overall choice in the 1998 draft. Leaf then signed a five-year contract reportedly worth $31.25 million, including an $11.25 million bonus.</p>
        <p>No wonder so much is at stake.</p>
        <p>Things certainly did not work out the first time. Leaf joined the Chargers after his junior year at Washington State, which he led to its first Rose Bowl in 67 years. After becoming the first quarterback since John Elway to win his first two N.F.L. starts, Leaf began to self-destruct. In his third start, on a rainy day at Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium, a difficult environment for any visiting quarterback, he went 1 for 15 with two interceptions and three lost fumbles. The Chargers lost, 23-7.</p>
        <p>He cursed a television cameraman in the locker room after the game and, a day later, launched into a tirade against a San Diego newspaper reporter who had written about the locker room incident. A month later there were news reports from Pullman, Wash., that Leaf, in town to make a $200,000 donation to his alma mater, was thrown out of two bars because of unruly behavior. Leaf denied those accounts.</p>
        <p>Leaf started the first nine games of the season, then was benched in favor of Craig Whelihan. Leaf finished the season with 15 interceptions and only 2 touchdowns, registering the league's lowest quarterback rating, 39.0. Meanwhile, in painful contrast, Peyton Manning, the quarterback drafted ahead of Leaf, was on his way to becoming a star with the resurgent Indianapolis Colts.</p>
        <p>Leaf's second season was not any better. He injured his throwing shoulder 20 minutes into the first training camp workout and missed the whole year, undergoing two shoulder operations. Moreover, he got into more trouble off the field. First, he had to be forced away from a verbal confrontation with a heckling fan during practice. Then, in November, he was suspended for four weeks after cursing at Bobby Beathard, the general manager then, in public. Beathard has since retired.</p>
        <p>Leaf is not interested in dwelling on his early indiscretions. There is nothing to gain, he said. Regarding the Beathard episode, he said that nobody knew the real story and that nobody probably ever would.</p>
        <p>Leaf, who is engaged to be married, prefers to focus on his good fortune. After all, it was not too long ago that he had feared his career might be in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>''Three months ago I didn't think I'd be able to throw a football,'' he said. ''The fact that I'm out here is way beyond my expectations for this year.''</p>
        <p>In a sense, his difficult recovery might be the best thing that happened to him. When he did come back, Coach Mike Riley suggested, Leaf realized it was a second chance.</p>
        <p>Riley believes Leaf can take advantage of the opportunity and live up to his potential. John Elway, the longtime Bronco, has left the American Conference West, Riley said, and the division is waiting for its next great quarterback.</p>
        <p>Like any inexperienced pro quarterback, Leaf has had trouble reading defenses. But, in an exhibition game against the San Francisco 49ers this month, Riley observed a more mature player in the pocket. Calling an audible, Leaf threw a long pass to wide receiver Mikhael Ricks. That was smart football, Riley recalled.</p>
        <p>Riley is in his second year with the Chargers, who were 8-8 last season. He isn't the only one to notice a different Leaf this summer. So have some of his teammates. They point to an incident several weeks ago, when Leaf pulled himself out of practice after feeling a pop in his shoulder.</p>
        <p>''The old Ryan Leaf would've hung it up,'' free safety Michael Dumas said. ''You wouldn't have seen him for a couple of days. But he was out there the next day, throwing and throwing.''</p>
        <p>Strong safety Rodney Harrison added: ''He's older now. He understands the big picture. I think he's gotten to the point where he said enough is enough. He truly wants to change. It feels like he's really part of the team.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, as much as Leaf may have progressed both on and off the field, Riley says he still has a lot to prove.</p>
        <p>''I wish him all the best, but I think the jury is out,'' said Bill Macdermott, a former Chargers tight ends coach who is now with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. ''As for whether Leaf will succeed in the N.F.L., I don't think it's a lock one way or the other. It's all up to Ryan.''</p>
