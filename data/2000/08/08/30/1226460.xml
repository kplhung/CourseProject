        <p>Voters in several Pittsburgh neighborhoods are at last turning attention to sizing up presidential candidates, with many experiencing 'epiphanic' moments that have caused them to rethink way they intend to vote; some point to what they see as Al Gore's winning performance at Democratic convention, others to discovery that George W Bush's running-mate, Dick Cheney, did not favor Head Start program; interest in campaign has increased since conventions, so that knowledge of issues and opinions about candidates are suddenly abundant; photos; shifts generally favor Gore, particularly his choice of Joseph Lieberman as running-mate (M)</p>

        <p>Here is how it happened for Joyce Doty: She started the summer already sold on Gov. George W. Bush. Then the conventions rolled around. Suddenly, Vice President Al Gore was looking handsome, sounding smart and intriguing her with the idea that ''maybe he wasn't too corrupted by Clinton after all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's convention performance, and subsequent stump speeches, have given her pause.</p>
        <p>''I started deciding that he doesn't have the charisma,'' said Mrs. Doty, who is in her 50's. ''He didn't do a good job of bringing the issues to the front. I would say he is in danger of losing my vote, if not overwhelmingly so.''</p>
        <p>Dozens of people interviewed in six neighborhoods here -- ranging from the exclusive suburb of Fox Chapel to the quiet working-class corner of Carnegie to the largely Jewish Squirrel Hill -- said they, too, had been experiencing epiphanic moments about their presidential candidates in recent days, often in ways that have caused them to rethink the way they intend to vote.</p>
        <p>For some people, the shifts have sprung from large single events -- a convention speech, a tax proposal, a choice of running mate. But for many others, their change in thinking has emerged from the smallest but most resonant of details, like a well-placed bottle of wine in a televised home video of Mr. Gore with his family that made Josh Kamody suddenly decide that Mr. Gore was ''fun, someone I felt I would like as my dad.''</p>
        <p>Or the discovery that Mr. Bush's running mate did not favor the Head Start program, which sent Gregg Rosen's vote packing.</p>
        <p>Rebecca Hepka, 23, was more or less indifferent to the race until she heard one of Mr. Gore's people use the term ''living wage,'' which sent her into paroxysms of rage and made her decide to vote for Mr. Bush. ''I don't like that term, no way,'' said Ms. Hepka, who sells medical insurance. ''I don't want to give away all my taxes to have other people set up for life.''</p>
        <p>Interest in the campaign appears to have heated up here considerably since the political conventions, and knowledge of the issues as well as opinions about the candidates are suddenly in abundance. Many people interviewed agreed that the candidates, who not long ago were largely unknown and almost cartoon-like to them, have revealed far more about themselves in recent days. In most cases, these shifts have favored Mr. Gore, whose legendary stiffness has been softened in many voters' eyes by a sheen of sincerity and a distancing in his relationship with Bill Clinton. Recent national polls place the candidates in a dead heat, in part resulting from a postconvention bounce that pulled Mr. Gore closer to, and in some cases beyond, his rival.</p>
        <p>Here, Mr. Gore was gaining some favor with people who said they had not planned to vote at all, like Linda Kelso, a store clerk who said that a recent visit to Pittsburgh by Mr. Gore's daughter softened her. ''It seemed sincere, like they were really for the people,'' Ms. Kelso said.</p>
        <p>In some cases, both men have benefited from exposure.</p>
        <p>''I was negative on both earlier this summer,'' said Ann Hazlett, 71, a retired social worker who lives in Fox Chapel. ''I was negative on Bush the person and Gore the party. But I liked Bush better later in the summer when he began to be more substantial and not such a smarty. And while I didn't think Gore's speech was outstanding, I felt there was sincerity there and I thought he did a good job of distancing himself from Clinton, who I no longer think will be telling him what to do. Really, I've warmed on them both.''</p>
        <p>Of course, 50 people do not represent America; they do not even represent Pittsburgh. But what was striking was the vast majority who insisted that they rarely voted strictly along party lines, and who claimed to be swayed so strongly in recent days. Many said they were early supporters of John McCain or Bill Bradley, and have started to weigh the relative merits of what they are left with.</p>
        <p>''I am party-indifferent,'' said Mr. Rosen, 47, a lawyer. ''My feelings started to evolve when Bush called the Greek people Grecians, and my opinion of Gore had been neutral. I would say now it is neutral to positive, largely because Bush doesn't have any policy positions. He speaks in conceptual terms.''</p>
        <p>Although fewer in number, some people interviewed said that recent days had brought them to Mr. Bush. ''I was for Bush and now I am more so,'' said Heather Hurley, who works with Ms. Hepka selling insurance downtown. ''I thought Gore looked better than ever but I don't care, because Bush's tax plan is more fair. And I like what he said last week about a strong military.''</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh has voted largely Democratic in recent decades, though its suburbs are sprinkled with Republican strongholds and it has a history of some political insurgency. The city and its suburbs are split between the 14th and 18th Congressional Districts, where Mr. Clinton took well over 50 percent of the vote in both 1992 and 1996.</p>
        <p>Since the decline of the steel industry, the city has struggled, with some notable success, to establish a more varied economic base. The city's downtown -- heavy on old-fashioned stores like Candy Rama, where clerks wear pink smocks and much of the merchandise is under a dollar  -- has undergone its share of revitalization plans, and the latest one in the offing calls for gutting most of the historic storefronts.</p>
        <p>Not exactly known for things like international culture or cuisine (when asked for a hamburger, medium, one waitress replied, ''They only come in one size, Hon''), the city has still doggedly pursued economic improvement and diversity and tried hard to retain its population, especially young people, who have tended to flee in recent decades. A recent building spree includes ballparks and a convention center.</p>
        <p>Melissa Kelley, 41, and her husband, Carl Brotsker, 50, represent emerging prosperity. The two leaned toward Mr. Bradley in the primaries, and have spent the summer looking for cues from speeches, the stock market and those who watch it, and the convention on how to proceed.</p>
        <p>Their paths have diverged at points. ''I was going to announce to Melissa that by pain of death I would be voting for Bush,'' said Mr. Brotsker, who lives on the city's North Side. His reason was fairly simple. ''As my economic situation has improved, I've been more intrigued by the Republican economic platform.''</p>
        <p>But then he started hearing whispers among those who handle his investments and market prognosticators that swayed him. With some embarrassment, he confessed that a comment of support for Mr. Gore voiced by the money manager Jim Cramer in an online chat swayed him greatly. ''The markets have seemed to indicate that the Bush tax cut might be inflationary,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kelley has had her own epiphanies. ''What I knew of Gore did not impress me initially,'' said Ms. Kelley, a lawyer. ''But he has been better at articulating his policies. It has been a long time since I have heard a candidate say women will retain choice regarding abortion, and that was impressive.''</p>
        <p>And then there is Joseph I. Lieberman. ''Making a choice can be a defining thing, an active thing,'' Ms. Kelley said. ''Gore's choice of Lieberman gave me an indication of other types of actions he might take. So I remain cynical, but I am happier than I had been.''</p>
        <p>In fact, several people indicated that the candidate's choice of running mate was hugely influential. ''I didn't like either of them until Gore chose Lieberman,'' said Carmen Hatcher, a systems technician. ''I don't believe Gore is a strong leader, but Lieberman will guide him,'' Ms. Hatcher said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hazlett said: ''I don't like Dick Cheney, which I hate to think would influence me so much. And I can't say that Lieberman would make me vote for Gore, but I have to tell you I am surprised by how many of my friends talk about that.''</p>
        <p>Some voters have stuck hard to one issue. ''I believe that Gore has a better understanding about education and has shown that in recent speeches,'' said John Bornyas, an education administrator. ''And I have gotten negative on Bush in the week since he could not get his numbers straight. But I need to see them both in the debates. And the truth is, there is always the Green Party.''</p>
