        <p>Nassau County has decided to begin ground spraying of pesticides to fight the West Nile virus, becoming one of the last counties in the metropolitan New York area this year to do so, after finding infected mosquitoes within its boundaries.</p>
        <p>The spraying, absent rain, is scheduled in Bethpage, Farmingdale, Massapequa and Massapequa Park tomorrow night. The weather tomorrow is expected to be warm, or mosquito-friendly.</p>
        <p>Nassau health officials said on Monday that infected mosquitoes had been found in two pools of water  along the Nassau-Suffolk border: one in Bethpage State Park and the other just north of the Sunrise Mall in Massapequa.</p>
        <p>''In light of the findings of infected mosquito pools, the county is following appropriate New York State Health Department protocol and will conduct limited ground spraying,'' said Thomas S. Gulotta, the county executive, in a statement.</p>
        <p>Nassau officials had said earlier this summer that spraying was not necessary because no mosquitoes in the county had tested positive for the virus.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Nassau's decision to refrain from spraying had been criticized by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who complained that a lack of action could be harmful to the city's public health. In New York City, officials this year have reported 79 pools of water harboring infected mosquitoes and doctors have confirmed the virus in five people; two people, one in Brooklyn and one on Staten Island, remain hospitalized.</p>
        <p>Dianne Baumert-Moyik, a spokeswoman for Nassau, said county officials understood Mr. Giuliani's concern.</p>
        <p>''He's calling for things in the best interest of his community,'' she said, ''and we're doing the same for ours.''</p>
        <p>The county plans to spray a pesticide called Scourge, which is closely related, chemically, to the Anvil pesticide being used by New York City, Westchester and other areas.</p>
        <p>Last year, seven people in the New York metropolitan area, including one from Nassau County, died from virus-related symptoms; 55 others were hospitalized, six of them from Nassau.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the New York State Health Department reported an additional 12 birds infected with the disease, including two in Nassau, two in Westchester, and one each in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Rockland. Altogether, strains of West Nile have been detected in 393 dead birds and in 171 mosquito pools in the region.</p>
