        <p>Leaked sales figures that were published in a British newspaper sent Marks &amp; Spencer P.L.C. shares reeling to their lowest level since 1990. The Financial Mail published figures showing that general merchandise sales excluding food slipped by more than 6 percent in the week to Aug. 19, compared with a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least one year declined by 7 percent, the newspaper reported. Marks &amp; Spencer, an icon of British retailing, has disputed the importance of the numbers by arguing that one week's results are not conclusive, especially during the summer sale season. Nevertheless, the latest sales results extend a slide that has been gathering steam for two years. Despite the efforts of its new chairman, Luc Vandevelde, the retailer has yet to show substantial improvements.</p>
