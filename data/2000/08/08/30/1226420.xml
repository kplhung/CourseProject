        <p>HOLLYWOOD BACKLASH -- Joe Eszterhas, the Hollywood screenwriter whose credits include ''Basic Instinct'' and ''Showgirls,'' is urging industry colleagues, many of them Democrats, not to contribute to the Democratic Party until Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut explain their position on ''freedom of creative expression.'' In a full-page ad in Tuesday's Daily Variety, the widely read trade paper, Mr. Eszterhas took issue with comments by Mr. Lieberman about excessive sex and violence in movies and television shows. He accused Mr. Lieberman of making ''not so veiled threats'' about withholding license renewals, instituting federal prosecutions and legislating censorship if writers and studios do not censor themselves. Mr. Lieberman's spokeswoman, Kiki McLean, replied, ''When there are products that are not necessarily good for our kids and our families, he's not going to be shy to challenge the industry. He's somebody who believes strongly in the First Amendment and has always had an open dialogue about what we can do voluntarily to help our families do better.''</p>

        <p>LABOR TO PUT GORE ONLINE -- The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has created a Web site where Vice President Al Gore will hold a live Webcast on Labor Day for union members. The Web site will allow union members to send e-mail messages to political candidates, including the vice president, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and members of Congress. The Web site -- www.workingfamilies.com -- will also feature a speech by John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, and video messages from what labor leaders call ''The Texas Truth Squad,'' a group of workers from Texas who are traveling the country to accuse Governor Bush of doing little on issues that unions care about. On the site, users will also be able to register to vote and can examine the voting record of candidates for Federal office. The site will be up from Aug. 30 to Sept. 6.</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>BUCHANAN OUT OF ACTION -- The Reform Party presidential hopeful Patrick J. Buchanan has canceled all public appearances until after Labor Day, after undergoing a second gall bladder operation because doctors found another stone. ''He feels a lot better and is coming along fine,'' said Brian Doherty, his campaign spokesman. ''But after two operations and losing 15 pounds or so from not being able to eat much, he needs to rest another week.'' Mr. Buchanan first underwent a gall stone operation on Aug. 17. After being released from the hospital on Aug. 19, he was recovering at his Northern Virginia home when he had a sharp abdominal pain. Doctors removed a second stone on Aug. 23 and he was released three days later. He plans to remain at home until Sept. 5.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>LIEBERMAN ON GORE -- Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut has a new, pointed pitch about his Democratic running mate. He says Vice President Al Gore is the best leader for the information age. Speaking to several thousand communications workers in Anaheim, Calif., yesterday, Mr. Lieberman warned that the United States cannot afford to have a president in the 21st century who does not understand the new economy and technology. Then, in a not-so-veiled dig at whether Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has the depth and preparedness to lead in a high-tech age, he invoked a couple of not-so-swift television cartoon characters, saying, ''We as a nation can't afford to make Barney Rubble investments in a George Jetson world.'' Mr. Lieberman said that Mr. Gore not only understands the new economy and technology but wants to speed its advances by investing in training people and by making college tuition tax-deductible.</p>
