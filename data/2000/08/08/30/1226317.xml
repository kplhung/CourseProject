        <p>ALL of a sudden, the city's chefs have gone completely salt crazy.</p>
        <p>It's not a matter of too much or too little -- but what kind? And preferably something so exotic the diner has never eaten it or heard of it, and probably couldn't buy it anywhere within a thousand miles. They're using a wild variety of salts for flavoring and color, actually as garnishes like chopped herbs. The city is becoming one big salt lick.</p>
        <p>At Esca, you might get pearly slivers of raw black bass sprinkled with black lava salt from Hawaii. The sea scallop ceviche at Aquavit glitters with sandy grains of delicate African salt. At Red Cat, the foie gras wears a sparkle of $32-a-pound Hawaiian red clay salt, a salt that had been used primarily in island rituals before chefs there picked up on it.</p>
        <p>''The clay adds a real earthiness to the foie gras that the other salts don't contribute,'' said Jimmy Bradley, the chef.</p>
        <p>Over the last year or so, chefs have begun using salts with the discernment and, some might say, the fanaticism, that was long reserved for the rarest olive oils. Today it's not uncommon to find seven or more precious salts in a top kitchen. And a chef who collects them with a fervor that borders on obsession.</p>
        <p>Marcus Samuelsson, at Aquavit, is constantly on the lookout: his most recent find was the African clay salt he picked up on a trip there. But he is also creating his own ''salts'' by drying and grinding salty ingredients like serrano ham and duck confit. Michel Nischan, the chef at Heartbeat, discovered his pink Peruvian sea salt while watching a documentary.</p>
        <p>''It's from the Andes,'' he said. ''And they have a land-locked ocean there, the salt lake that had dried out, and once a year they harvest the salt. They go out with a saw and cut the salt into large bricks and they mound them on their llamas. They travel with them about 200 miles to the nearest city, and they trade them for a year's worth of provisions. I saw it on the Discovery Channel.''</p>
        <p>The salt, he said, has a minerally quality: ''It's unbelievable on sliced ripe tomatoes.''</p>
        <p>These salts are expensive -- they begin at $32 a pound, and cost as much as $84 a pound for a smoked Danish salt that Mr. Nischan finds essential for a salmon dish. It's a significant investment -- especially if you consider that plain table salt is about 25 cents a pound. And some chefs have given that up completely.</p>
        <p>At Union Pacific, Rocco DiSpirito uses only sea salt; he even salts the water for blanching vegetables and boiling pasta with French sea salt. ''Sea salt tastes a lot better than mined salt,'' he said. ''It's got a real saline, ocean character that comes across in the food.'' Regular table salt and kosher salt are mined from the earth; they are cheap and characterless because they must be highly refined. Sea salt is produced from evaporating seawater. It can be quickly evaporated and superrefined, and it sells for just a few dollars, or it can be left with a lot of the minerals in it, like the good, grayish or off-white sea salts, and the rarer kinds chefs now covet.</p>
        <p>The most popular sea salts among chefs are sel gris, a moist gray, large-grained salt usually from Brittany or Normandy, and fleur de sel, an expensive, gently flavored, off-white salt with small lacy flakes.</p>
        <p>Pierre Herme, the French pastry chef, is so completely enamored of fleur de sel that he never leaves home without it: for the last 10 years he has carried a small, specially made wooden box filled with it in his briefcase at all times.</p>
        <p>''I often have to use it in restaurants,'' he said. ''It can even turn a bad meal into something not so bad.''</p>
        <p>Another favorite of Mr. Bradley at Red Cat and other chefs is farmed in Essex, England. Maldon sea salt has characteristic pyramid-shaped crystals that shimmer in the light like diamond chips. This salt, like the red clay and most of the more exotic salts on the scene, is best raw. Mr. Bradley compares the salts to the best quality extra virgin olive oils.</p>
        <p>''If you cook with them,'' he said, ''their flavors diminish.''</p>
        <p>Hence the raw fish dishes at Esca called crudos. What makes more sense than using raw sea salt with raw seafood? David Pasternack, the chef there, uses a different sea salt with each kind of seafood.</p>
        <p>''Each of the salts possesses a different flavor,'' he said, ''and you have to learn how to use them to their best advantage. The black salt tastes like you're taking a bite of the earth, so I use that with a stronger fish. The red salt is milder, so it goes with a blander fish.''</p>
        <p>For cooking, Mr. Pasternack sticks with relatively neutral salts, like a fine-grained Sicilian. He then adds a more potent salt as a garnish.</p>
        <p>In an appetizer of seared Maine shrimp, he seasons the shrimp with the Sicilian salt, then cooks them in extra virgin olive oil. To finish the dish, instead of a sauce the shrimp get a drizzle of estate bottled extra virgin olive oil and a shower of the black lava salt -- two kinds of olive oil and two kinds of salt for five shrimp.</p>
        <p>While it's true that all of these unusual sea salts have their own distinctive flavors, there is undeniably something to be said for the aesthetics of their large crystalline grains and vivid colors.</p>
        <p>Tom Colicchio, the chef of Gramercy Tavern, occasionally uses Hawaiian red clay salt to finish a dish of white-fleshed turbot.</p>
        <p>When asked why he likes that particular salt with that particular fish he replied, ''It shows up.''</p>
        <p>Full Shakers</p>
        <p>FINE sea salts are $15 a pound at specialty markets. Black lava and red clay salts can be ordered from Hawaii Kai Salts, (808) 553-3461 ($2 an ounce, plus shipping). Smoked Danish salt is $10.50 for two ounces, and Peruvian pink salt is $28.50 for seven ounces, from Cooking School of Aspen, (800) 603-6004.</p>
        <p>GRILLED CURED SALMON  Adapted from Heartbeat  Time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon whole coriander seeds  1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns  1 dried cascabel pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 cup turbinado sugar</p>
        <p>1/4 cup smoked Danish sea salt (see box)</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  4 pieces skinless, boneless salmon fillet, about 1 3/4 pounds total.</p>
        <p>1. In a small skillet over high heat, toast  coriander and peppercorns until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool. Place cascabel pepper in pan, and toast it on all sides until skin blisters, about 5 minutes. Let cool, then tear it into small pieces.</p>
        <p>2. Combine toasted coriander seeds, peppercorns and cascabel pepper in a spice grinder. Grind to a fine powder. Combine powder with sugar, salt and ground black pepper in a medium mixing bowl. Sprinkle half this cure mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment or waxed paper. Shape cure into a flat mound that matches shape and size of  salmon fillets. Place salmon on top, and cover with remaining cure. Cover with a small piece of parchment or waxed pepper, then wrap with plastic and refrigerate for 2 hours.</p>
        <p>3. Scrape cure off salmon with knife. Preheat a grill or broiler. Grill or broil salmon, turning once, for a total of 5 to 7 minutes, or until slightly translucent in center.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
