        <p>For the first time in 10 years, Nickelodeon, the top-rated network on basic cable, is changing its look. Starting in early September, executives said yesterday, they will introduce new promotional spots and graphics for its children's programming. They said the spots would be less erratic and more uniform than they are currently.</p>
        <p>The promotional spots will feature variations of the Nickelodeon logo, quick shots of characters from the show in progress and the children's voices alerting the audience to stay put during the commercial breaks or that a show is returning from commercial break.</p>

        <p>For the first time in 10 years, Nickelodeon, the top-rated network on basic cable, is changing its look. Starting in early September, executives said yesterday, they will introduce new promotional spots and graphics for its children's programming. They said the spots would be less erratic and more uniform than they are currently.</p>
        <p>The promotional spots will feature variations of the Nickelodeon logo, quick shots of characters from the show in progress and the children's voices alerting the audience to stay put during the commercial breaks or that a show is returning from commercial break.</p>
        <p>The change is notable because the network's brightly colored graphics and overall lively appearance -- established through promotions as much as programming -- have been considered a vital ingredient to its success.</p>
        <p>They were devised to make children feel that Nickelodeon is their home base on television.</p>
        <p>But Nickelodeon has in some respects become a victim of its own success, inspiring others, like the Walt Disney Company, Fox and Turner Broadcasting to form their own channels with similar approaches to Nickelodeon's.</p>
        <p>Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon's executive vice president and general manager, said it was with that in mind that she and her fellow executives had decided to devise the changes. ''There are a lot of players in our game right now, and there are a lot of copycats,'' she said. ''While everybody has gotten to look a lot like we look, we're changing our look.''</p>
