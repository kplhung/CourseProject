        <p>The Giants had targeted Shaun Williams to be their starting free safety even before training camp began. His summer, though, was ruined after a sprained left big toe forced him to miss all four preseason games. Still, on Sunday, in the season opener, Williams will make his first National Football League start.</p>
        <p>Williams, who played most of the last two seasons as a nickel back and backup safety, will also be a target of Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer. But Williams is eager to finally meet the expectations of Coach Jim Fassel.</p>
        <p>''Of course they expect big things from me,'' Williams said this week at practice. ''I was a first-round draft pick a couple of years ago. They expect me to go out and perform. I know that. It's something that I expect from myself also.''</p>
        <p>But Williams remains a key part of an alarmingly thin secondary. Lyle West, a second-year player who spent most of his six games last season on special teams, replaced Williams during the preseason and Reggie Stephens was moved from cornerback to be the fourth safety.</p>
        <p>Jason Sehorn, the right cornerback, could again emerge as a Pro Bowl candidate after two injury-marred seasons, but left cornerback Dave Thomas is new and has been tested through the preseason.</p>
        <p>The Giants didn't re-sign Percy Elsworth during the off-season, essentially handing Williams the free safety job. Williams embraces the opportunity to concentrate on one position after constantly thinking of where he would play depending on the game situation.</p>
        <p>Still, he prefers to see his time at other positions as a positive and believes it has taught him the intricacies of the complicated schemes of the defensive coordinator John Fox.</p>
        <p>''I think it helped me in the long run, getting me down there and playing with some quick receivers,'' said Williams, who said he no longer relies solely on his athleticism but studies the game more intently.</p>
        <p>A month on the sideline made that necessary.</p>
        <p>''He's played a lot of football here for us,'' Fox said. ''He's very familiar with the system. Early in his career we played him everywhere so he has a great understanding of our package. Like any football player, you would've liked to have gotten some playing time for him. Obviously that's a concern but I have a lot of confidence in Shaun Williams.''</p>
        <p>Injuries have been an unfortunate companion throughout Williams's first two seasons. Hamstring injuries cost him five games last season and three in 1998. Then came the sprained toe on the first play of the preseason scrimmage that left Williams on crutches. Williams is healthy enough to play, but just how much has the lack of playing time affected him?</p>
        <p>''He'll have a full week of practice to see plays,'' Fox said. ''Nothing's really like a game so hopefully he can rely on his background and can play well.''</p>
        <p>Even after seeing him come through his first practice unscathed, Fassel was not ready to stop worrying about his free safety. Williams felt fine Monday, when the Giants used light-weight pads and practiced indoors because of rain. He will know more today and tomorrow when the Giants work out in full pads. Williams has tried to keep up with his teammates by following the plays from the sideline.</p>
        <p>''I felt pretty good out there,'' Williams said. ''On the sidelines when I was hurt, I tried to make sure I made all the checks, make all the calls, focus on the things. Just study the game more. That's the benefit I had, being able to sit back and learn about the game.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>JIM FASSEL named JAY ROBERTSON the offensive quality control coach, replacing MIKE GILLHAMER, who was promoted to replace JIM SKIPPER as the running backs coach. Skipper left the team last week to coach in the Xtreme Football League, the professional entry of the World Wrestling Federation. Robertson last coached with the Colts in 1997 as a defensive assistant. . . . Five players cut Sunday were signed to the practice squad: tackle CHRIS BOBER, linebacker O. J. CHILDRESS, defensive end FRANK FERRARA, fullback MICHAEL JONES and tight end ADAM YOUNG.</p>
