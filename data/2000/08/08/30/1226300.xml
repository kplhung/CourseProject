        <p>WHOEVER figured out that this stuff was edible?'' asked one of my guests, who was scooping up a savory mixture based on the culinary oddity huitlacoche. Good question.</p>
        <p>Huitlacoche (pronounced weet-lah-COH-chay) is a fungus that attacks corn growing in the fields, causing kernels to blacken and swell. It is not clear who discovered that the  fungus had a lush, mushroomy flavor. But today's fans of the delicacy, which is often compared to truffles, should probably thank some long-ago Mexicans who had adventuresome palates.</p>

        <p>WHOEVER figured out that this stuff was edible?'' asked one of my guests, who was scooping up a savory mixture based on the culinary oddity huitlacoche. Good question.</p>
        <p>Huitlacoche (pronounced weet-lah-COH-chay) is a fungus that attacks corn growing in the fields, causing kernels to blacken and swell. It is not clear who discovered that the  fungus had a lush, mushroomy flavor. But today's fans of the delicacy, which is often compared to truffles, should probably thank some long-ago Mexicans who had adventuresome palates.</p>
        <p>In Mexico, huitlacoche (also spelled cuitlacoche) is treasured and used in quesadillas, crepes and soups. Most American farmers consider it a blight, but Blooming Hill Organics in Blooming Grove, N.Y., has fields of it. And instead of complaining, the farmer, Guy Jones, sells it to chefs at nearly four times the price of unaffected corn.  Mr. Jones also sells it to the four Gourmet Garage stores, where corn with a quarter to a half cup of fresh huitlacoche to scrape off costs $1.99 an ear. It freezes well. Canned huitlacoche is $3.90 for seven ounces at Kitchen, 218 Eighth Avenue (22nd Street).</p>
        <p>At the new Rosa Mexicano restaurant near Lincoln Center, huitlacoche is sauteed with chilies, garlic, onion, corn and epazote, a Mexican herb, and then served with freshly baked tortilla chips. It does have a muddy, blackish look, but have no fear: the dish, fragrant with herbs and gently spiced, is delectable.</p>
        <p>FLORENCE FABRICANT</p>
        <p>HUITLACOCHE TOSTADA  Adapted from Rosa Mexicano  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>8 corn tortillas  2 tablespoons corn oil  1 medium onion, finely chopped  2 cloves garlic, minced  2 ears fresh corn, kernels stripped  1 fresh poblano pepper, cored, seeded and finely chopped  1 3/4 cups huitlacoche (4 to 5 ears fresh corn or 2 7-ounce cans)  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 tablespoon chopped fresh epazote or cilantro leaves</p>
        <p>1/2 cup creme fraiche or sour cream.</p>
        <p>1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Place tortillas on baking sheet, and bake until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and cool.</p>
        <p>2. Heat oil in 10-inch skillet. Add onion, garlic, corn and poblano, and saute over medium heat about 5 minutes, until onions are translucent. Add huitlacoche, and continue cooking over low heat about 15 minutes, mashing larger pieces of huitlacoche. Add a little water if mixture seems dry. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Just before serving, fold in epazote or cilantro. Transfer to serving dish, break tortillas into large pieces, and place around huitlacoche mixture for dipping. Serve creme fraiche or sour cream on the side.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
