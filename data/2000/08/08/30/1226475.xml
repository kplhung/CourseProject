        <p>Mr. Gonzalez, who grew up in Puerto Rico and the South Bronx, has often lectured about the difficulties of being a Hispanic in television broadcasting. For decades, he has taught in journalism programs for minorities, helping young Hispanics break into the field. He is now an adjunct professor in the multilingual journalism department of Lehman College in the Bronx.</p>
