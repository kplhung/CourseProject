        <p>When was the last time you heard these words: Teams are dreaming of becoming the St. Louis Rams.</p>
        <p>It was not too long ago when the Rams were the punch line of jokes; Lawrence Phillips, the team's No. 1 draft pick, made the police blotter once a month and the stadium was not filled with bodies, but boos.</p>
        <p>A Super Bowl changed that. A remarkable long-shot story changed that. Everyone is now a Rams wannabe.</p>
        <p>This weekend the National Football League begins its first season of the new century and clearly the sport has embarked on Football A.D.: After Dynasties.</p>
        <p>With the fall of empires like the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys comes a wide-open game and the notion that any team with an accurate quarterback, speed and confidence can snag the big prize.</p>
        <p>St. Louis proved that using that formula can change a franchise's fortune in an instant as the Rams jumped from four victories in 1998 to a 13-3 regular-season mark last season, followed weeks later by a Super Bowl championship.</p>
        <p>Now there is a cadre of teams, some in the middle of the pack, others at the bottom of the pile, that believe they can make the leap that the Rams made. What is unclear is the accuracy of those feelings. Are these hopes realistic, because the N.F.L. is now a parity-filled league, or do these teams need to wake up and smell the Gatorade?</p>
        <p>''Everyone is trying to find the next Rams, but you know what, I don't think there is one,'' said General Manager Ernie Accorsi of the Giants, a team that might be a contender in the ''Who Wants to Be the Next St. Louis?'' sweepstakes.</p>
        <p>''What the Rams did was remarkable,'' Accorsi said. ''It was unprecedented. You have all these prognosticators on television and teams saying who will be the next Rams.</p>
        <p>''But no one seems to be considering that what the Rams did may never happen again.''</p>
        <p>Try telling that to the dreamers, many of whom are players emerging from the optimism-fest known as training camp, and your cynicism will be met with a smirk. The rallying cry of some teams, as one player said, seems to be, ''Hey, if the sorry Rams can do it, so can we.''</p>
        <p>''I think it's only natural to look at what the Rams did and think you can do it, too,'' Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb said.</p>
        <p>Jessie Armstead, a  Pro Bowl linebacker with the Giants, said: ''There are going to be surprise teams. There are always surprises. Why not us?''</p>
        <p>That is what a lot of teams are asking: Why not us?</p>
        <p>The question is certainly being heard in Philadelphia. The Eagles, winners of five games last season, have a franchise quarterback in McNabb, a solid runner in Duce Staley and a strong defense. The Eagles also play a last-place schedule.</p>
        <p>Oakland is another possible St. Louis. The Raiders have a good runner in Tyrone Wheatley, who, despite splitting time with Napoleon Kaufman last season, still rushed for 936 yards and eight touchdowns.</p>
        <p>The Giants, coming off a 7-9 season, think they have the quarterback to make a serious push. But the difference between New York and St. Louis -- and it is a huge one -- is that St. Louis had one of the best pass defenses in football last season. The Giants have far from that.</p>
        <p>The Jets won their last four games in 1999 to finish 8-8 in what amounted to one of Bill Parcells's best-ever coaching jobs. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde is back from his Achilles' injury and running back Curtis Martin remains one of the most dangerous weapons in football.</p>
        <p>But Parcells is no longer coaching the Jets and neither is the former defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, who is at New England. That is too much brainpower to lose. The Rams had a unified, top-notch coaching staff in 1999.</p>
        <p>Like the Jets, the Baltimore Ravens also had eight victories a year ago, and they might be the most intriguing of the teams trying to duplicate what the Rams did. The Ravens won't have as far to climb, so they don't fit into the true Rams model, but Baltimore had a history of heartbreak when the franchise was still in Cleveland, and in that the Rams and the Ravens have a common ground. The John Elway-led Denver Broncos beat Cleveland three times in the American Football Conference championship game.</p>
        <p>Now the Ravens, like the Rams a season ago, have one of the top defenses in the league and a potential franchise runner in the rookie Jamal Lewis.</p>
        <p>But Baltimore is a popular pick. To truly fit the miracle Rams mode, a team has to come from nowhere. Cincinnati, Chicago or New Orleans -- now those are real Rams wannabes.</p>
        <p>Maybe Accorsi and others are right. Maybe looking for the next Rams is like Geraldo Rivera searching for Al Capone's hidden vault. It's a sexy idea but not truly attainable.</p>
        <p>Then again the Rams were not supposed to have a chance. So maybe fans in Cleveland should start packing for a little Super Bowl trip.</p>
