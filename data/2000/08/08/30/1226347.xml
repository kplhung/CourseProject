        <p>Muslim rebels who thrive on kidnapping seized an American on a remote Philippine island and threatened today to kill him if the United States did not meet unspecified demands.</p>
        <p>The Abu Sayyaf rebels, who have been holding a group of Europeans, South Africans and Asians for four months, said in a radio broadcast that ''we have been trying very hard to get an American.''</p>
        <p>They identified their captive as Jeffrey Craig Schilling, 24, and said he was an agent for the Central Intelligence Agency. They added, ''We will not hesitate to execute this American guy if the Philippine government and the United States will not listen to our demands.''</p>
        <p>They said they would announce their demands within three days.</p>
        <p>In Washington, the State Department condemned the kidnapping and demanded Mr. Schilling's unconditional release.</p>
        <p>''We do not make deals with terrorists,'' said Philip Reeker, the department spokesman. ''We will not pay ransom. We will not change policies. We will not release prisoners or make any other concessions that reward hostage-taking.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reeker said privacy regulations prohibited him from saying whether Mr. Schilling worked for the government. But an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mr. Schilling ''absolutely did not'' work for the C.I.A. A Pentagon spokesman said he had no connection to the military.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the Abu Sayyaf group killed two Filipino hostages after failing in a demand that the United States release several Arab terrorists imprisoned after the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.</p>
        <p>The Philippine government confirmed the abduction, saying a representative of the government's chief hostage negotiator had seen Mr. Schilling being held in an Abu Sayyaf camp. The American Embassy in Manila said it was sending six officials to Zamboanga, the nearest city, where Mr. Schilling had lived for several months with his Filipino girlfriend.</p>
        <p>The abduction is the latest twist in a kidnapping spree that started on April 23, when Abu Sayyaf gunmen abducted 21 mostly Western hostages from a diving resort on a nearby Malaysian island. Since then, several hostages have been freed, and several more have been seized. Before Mr. Schilling's abduction, the gunmen were holding six Westerners and a dozen Filipinos.</p>
        <p>Six other Westerners were freed on Sunday and Monday in exchange for reported payments of $1 million each. That money came from Libya, which acted as go-between in those releases, raising the possibility that the United States might find itself turning to Libya for help in freeing Mr. Schilling.</p>
        <p>A Libyan official said today that his nation would be happy to help if asked.</p>
        <p>In the radio interview, the Abu Sayyaf spokesman, Abu Sabaya, suggested that an American should be worth 10 times as much as a European.</p>
        <p>If they decide to kill Mr. Schilling, he said, ''then next week we will get another hostage and do the same thing to him.'' He added, ''The Americans may think we are afraid of them, but we are really determined to get an American.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schilling's girlfriend, Ivi V. Osani, said Mr. Schilling had been curious about life in the southern Philippines and despite her warnings had traveled with her to the tiny island of Jolo, where the hostages are being held.</p>
        <p>Miss Osani said in a radio interview in Zaboanga that the rebel spokesman was a relative of her mother, and that ''they have been inviting us to visit Jolo, but we didn't want to go because I knew we would be taken.''</p>
        <p>In its negotiations for the Western hostages, the Philippine government has relied on intermediaries from Libya, which for years has had close relations with Muslim separatist fighters in the southern Philippines.</p>
        <p>Some commentators have suggested that Libya's mediating role is an attempt to burnish its international image.</p>
        <p>The United States and others have blamed the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, for a number of terrorist acts around the world.</p>
        <p>At about the time Mr. Schilling was being kidnapped, the six recently freed hostages were arriving to a festive welcome today in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, after being flown there on a Libyan airliner. The freed hostages, from France, Germany, South Africa and Lebanon, were to be sent home later.</p>
        <p>A Libyan Foreign Ministry official, speaking on Qatar's satellite television station, said his nation would try to help secure Mr. Schilling's release if asked. ''If we have to carry out a role to save the life of a human being, whether he is an American or European, we will not hesitate to help,'' said the official, Hassounah el-Shawish.</p>
        <p>In the Philippines today, the immigration authorities provided a copy of Mr. Schilling's passport to reporters. It said he was born in Minnesota on Feb. 4, 1976, and had entered the Philippines on March 8, extending his visitor's visa twice. The State Department said that he was most recently a resident of Oakland, Calif.</p>
        <p>Miss Osani said he had been scheduled to return to the United States on Sept. 3 but had wanted to go to Jolo, a pretty island in the Sulu Sea, ''just for once'' before he left.</p>
        <p>She said that gunmen had accompanied them by boat from Zamboanga to Jolo on Monday and that she realized Mr. Schilling had been kidnapped when he told her to return home alone.</p>
        <p>She said she was from the nearby island of Basilan, a stronghold of Abu Sayyaf, which is a small splinter group from a long-running Muslim separatist insurgency in the southern Philippines.</p>
        <p>Originally numbering only 200 or so fighters, it has focused more on the business of kidnapping than on ideological warfare. Kidnapping is so common in the area that it has been somewhat formalized, with the going rate for ransoms at about $5,000.</p>
        <p>But Abu Sayyaf, small as it is, is broken into several factions. Philippine officials say its squabbles over tactics and the division of ransom have complicated negotiations.</p>
