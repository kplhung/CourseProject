        <p>When Gwen Hahn, a stay-at-home mother, decided this summer that it was time to re-enter the work force, she braced herself for rejection.</p>
        <p>''I worried that employers might not take me seriously,'' said Ms. Hahn, who had quit her job as a catering manager for a Phoenix hotel six years ago to spend more time with her three children.</p>
        <p>Instead, Ms. Hahn received a job offer even before she had a chance to send out her resume. Her boss-to-be, Nancy Nachman, president of a firm in Scottsdale, Ariz., that plans meetings for companies, was a guest at a party she held and was immediately taken with her people skills.</p>
        <p>''As soon as I saw Gwen, I knew that she was a natural for the job,'' Ms. Nachman said. Not long after, she offered Ms. Hahn a position as a planner with the company, the Meetings Concierge, starting in early September, and Ms. Hahn accepted.</p>
        <p>Not so long ago, housewives with resume gaps spanning several years faced tough slogging in the job market. No more. In today's full-employment economy, employers are actively wooing women who held jobs once upon a time and finding in them a rich new source of talent.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that employers are taking a second look at women who are re-entering the work force.'' said Marcia Brumit Kropf, vice president for research and information services for Catalyst, a New York research group that studies women's issues. ''Today's job market is so tight that employers are opening their mind to nontraditional candidates. If a woman has talent and a good track record, a gap in her resume is no longer as relevant.''</p>
        <p>And it does not seem to matter if the gap is more a chasm. Katherine Goldman quit her job as creative director for an advertising agency in Princeton, N.J., after her first child was born more than 14 years ago.</p>
        <p>''I always kept my eyes and ears open,'' said Ms. Goldman, who spent the next 11 years doing freelance work for ad agencies while caring for her two children, who are now teenagers. When Ms. Goldman decided last year to go back to work full time, she called a contact at Jack Morton Worldwide, a branding communications firm.</p>
        <p>''As a returning mother, I thought I might have to explain myself,'' she said. ''Instead, after I told him that I'd like to work for him, he said, 'Wow, that's great, you're hired.' ''</p>
        <p>Cynthia Kuker, Ms. Goldman's boss, says the hot economy has forced her company's executives to soften their old hiring requirements. ''We're a niche market without a large employee pool, so we're bringing in applicants who on paper might not look like the ideal candidate, but who might have just the skills we're looking for,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And, as was the case with Ms. Hahn, those skills went beyond workplace credentials and centered on personality. The company was attracted by her maturity and confidence as well as her broad background in writing and advertising, Ms. Kuker said. ''She was bringing something totally different to the table that somebody who had just gotten out of school, or maybe had one job, wouldn't have,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So eager are some employers to tap into the stay-at-home-mom pool that many are courting them with flexible-work arrangements, day care and other perks.</p>
        <p>''For the first time, I'm seeing a few law firms offer four-day workweeks to working mothers,'' said Jillian Winoker, director of associate placements for Corrao Miller Rush &amp; Wiesenthal, a New York employment firm. ''You would never have seen that in the legal profession five years ago.''</p>
        <p>It is not just law firms. In 1998, Ernst &amp; Young, the big accounting firm, created a host of flexible work arrangements, from compressed work schedules and telecommuting to job sharing. ''Women returning to the work force are typically highly skilled, and we have to be creative in attracting them,'' said Deborah Holmes, national director of the firm's office of retention.</p>
        <p>One woman who was attracted was Sharon Kurtz, now a manager of internal audit services for the firm. Ms. Kurtz had previously worked for Ernst &amp; Young until her second child was born in 1995.</p>
        <p>She decided to apply for a second job there in March 1999, after taking a break to spend time with her children.</p>
        <p>''When I left, the climate for working mothers was totally different,'' said Ms. Kurtz, who now works a three-day week. ''I would leave after a nine-hour day, and a co-worker would say, 'Oh, half-day today?' ''</p>
        <p>Now, Ms. Kurtz said, so many employees have flexible arrangements that nobody questions that she works three days a week.</p>
        <p>Another reason women are finding it easier to re-enter the work force is that they are becoming more adept at keeping their foot in the door while they are gone. Although they are often busy raising children, some women make a point of updating their skills, taking classes and networking with peers.</p>
        <p>Consider Cindy Bateman, a mother of two from Seattle. Soon after Ms. Bateman left her position as a vice president at the Pacific National Bank in Newport Beach, Calif., in December 1998, to spend more time with her children, she enrolled in an M.B.A. program at the University of Washington. She also accepted a position as a public affairs officer for an association for women who work in the financial industry. She plans to resume working in another year, when her younger child starts school and she has earned her master's degree.</p>
        <p>Though by then she will have been out of the work force for about three years, she is confident she will find work as a senior bank manager. ''I'm already getting calls from prospective employers,'' Ms. Bateman said. ''I've gotten so much positive feedback that I hadn't really considered that there was any difference between me and a job candidate who hadn't taken time off.''</p>
        <p>The journey back to the office is not all smooth sailing, of course. Ms. Hahn, for example, worries about whether her computer skills are up to speed. ''It's kind of intimidating,'' she said. ''In my old job, I had a support staff to do this kind of stuff.''</p>
        <p>Then there is the inevitable culture shock. Ms. Goldman, who is in her early 40's, said reporting to people who are younger than she is could be tough.</p>
        <p>But her biggest struggle, she said, has been making her family accustomed to the fact that she is working again and to share household chores like making dinner and doing the laundry. ''We're having to renegotiate roles,'' she said. 'My working is something we're all still getting used to.''</p>
