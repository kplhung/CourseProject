        <p>The City Council speaker called a news conference at Columbus Park in Lower Manhattan yesterday to vividly illustrate the findings of a Council study on drinking fountains in city parks. It did not go exactly as planned.</p>
        <p>The Council's Office of Oversight and Investigation had checked the fountains in more than 300 parks across the city and found rusted spigots, basins littered with chicken bones and standing water that threatened to attract mosquitoes infected by the West Nile virus. The speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said 23 percent of the fountains did not produce any water -- including the one in Columbus Park -- and 36 percent failed to work properly. He urged the Parks Department to overhaul 1,500 of the city's nearly 2,500 outdoor drinking fountains.</p>
        <p>''It is as hard to get a free sip of water in our parks as to get a taxi at rush hour,'' Mr. Vallone said.</p>
        <p>Well, not always.</p>
        <p>Between Monday afternoon, when word of the news conference circulated, and yesterday afternoon, when Mr. Vallone was intending to try -- for the benefit of reporters and television cameras -- to get a drink from the broken fountain in Columbus Park, something happened.</p>
        <p>Just before the news conference began, it was discovered that the drinking fountain in Columbus Park worked just fine.</p>
        <p>It seems the Parks Department, wise to Mr. Vallone's plans, dispatched plumbers to the park to make hurried overnight repairs, denying Mr. Vallone the drama of a broken spigot. ''It just goes to show, if they can fix this overnight, what they could do,'' Mr. Vallone said.</p>
        <p>In an interview yesterday, Henry J. Stern, the parks commissioner, said he welcomed the City Council survey, and did not dispute its findings. He attributed the poor condition of park fountains to their age, which he said generally exceeds 50 years, and complex underground plumbing.</p>
        <p>''Their figures are essentially reasonable, and they have called attention to an annoying problem,'' Mr. Stern said. ''Now it is in their hands to provide a remedy.''</p>
        <p>That remedy, he maintained, could come in the form of a bigger Parks Department budget. He said the Council could allocate money to double the size of the department's 30-member plumbing staff, and provide  $5 million or more for new fountains, pipes and other fixtures.</p>
        <p>The department's budget for such projects this year is $200 million, its highest ever.</p>
