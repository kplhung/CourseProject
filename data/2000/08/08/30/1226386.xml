        <p>In their latest effort to rid the city of big tracts of land in Harlem, officials are selling 13 large vacant lots for $1 apiece and expect to receive about 50 applications today from developers offering plans for new housing.</p>
        <p>The sales are the second round under a city plan to divest itself of properties in Harlem it acquired over the years because of abandonment by landlords, tax foreclosures and arson. In April, the city sold eight vacant lots to six developers for $1 each. All told, city officials said they expect to see the 21 sites developed with about 2,500 units of middle-income and market rate housing over the next two years. This round includes the largest remaining parcels of vacant land in the city's inventory.</p>

        <p>In their latest effort to rid the city of big tracts of land in Harlem, officials are selling 13 large vacant lots for $1 apiece and expect to receive about 50 applications today from developers offering plans for new housing.</p>
        <p>The sales are the second round under a city plan to divest itself of properties in Harlem it acquired over the years because of abandonment by landlords, tax foreclosures and arson. In April, the city sold eight vacant lots to six developers for $1 each. All told, city officials said they expect to see the 21 sites developed with about 2,500 units of middle-income and market rate housing over the next two years. This round includes the largest remaining parcels of vacant land in the city's inventory.</p>
        <p>''What we've done is taken most of the really conspicuously blighted property and put in on an accelerated timetable for development,'' said James F. Lima, assistant commissioner for the Division of New Construction of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. ''There is a tremendous amount of vacant land that was cleared by urban renewal and has remained vacant for years.''</p>
        <p>The $1 price tag is intended to encourage nonprofit developers to apply for the lots, according to the Housing Department. Although $145 million in public and private subsidies were available to developers who were awarded the last round of lots, no such subsidies are attached to the new group of sites.</p>
        <p>The city acquired many of the properties in the late 1960's and early 1970's, and by 1975, the majority of Harlem's property -- about 65 percent -- had fallen into the city's hands. Some properties, including many along a swath of Frederick Douglass Boulevard in central Harlem, have remained there ever since, costing the city hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in maintenance costs alone.</p>
        <p>The plan to require developers to submit specific housing plans for the property was formed by the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, and the Housing Department. They were responding to concerns from community leaders that too much property was being auctioned to the highest bidder without any specific plans in mind, and that the buyers would merely hold the land until they could resell it for a higher price.</p>
        <p>''Without a plan for the land, it will be at best accidental that the vision of the community is fulfilled,'' said Councilman Bill Perkins, who represents central Harlem. ''What usually happens is they auction off the lot, but the same rat-infested, garbage-infested conditions continue after the sale, because it goes to speculators and profiteers who hold on to the lot until they can get a better deal.''</p>
        <p>Three months ago, Mr. Perkins blocked an auction of 24 plots of land in his district to thwart speculators. Denise Collins, a spokeswoman for city's Department of Citywide Administrative Services, said the Harlem lots were considered surplus because when they were offered to other city agencies, none were interested in making use of them.</p>
        <p>''All we're asking is that the city remove it from the city's portfolio and sell it to whoever can make use of it,'' Ms. Collins said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fields wants at least six of those lots to be earmarked for new housing, and they could potentially become part of a future round of $1 sales. ''The city is in a position to drive the development of housing, by developing a plan, as opposed to putting it on the auction block for the highest bidder,'' she said. ''The highest bidder does not necessarily know what's best for a community.''</p>
        <p>But her housing plan has drawn criticism from some neighborhood groups who fear the property could end up in the hands of developers from outside Harlem, who they say may not have the neighborhood's best interests in mind.</p>
        <p>In April, when the city sold the first group of eight vacant lots for $1, only one of the six developers chosen was based in Harlem. Among those whose proposals were rejected were the Abyssinian Development Corporation, a nonprofit developer affiliated with the Abyssinian Baptist Church of Harlem, and Hope Community, a nonprofit developer responsible for hundreds of new units of housing in East Harlem.</p>
        <p>Among the companies chosen were the Richman Group of New York, the Glenwood Management Corporation, which has erected several buildings on the Upper East Side, and Citywide Builders, a consortium of minority-owned development firms in New York.</p>
        <p>Carol Abrams, a spokeswoman for the housing agency, said the city selected those developers based on the merit of their proposals but was working with local nonprofit community developers on other sites in Harlem.</p>
