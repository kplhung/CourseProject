        <p>For those who have not rocked to the invincible Australian band AC/ DC, allow this critic to instruct you in the pastime enjoyed by millions, including the crowd at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Enter whatever sports arena presents these veterans on their latest visit. Stand, beer in hand, in preparation. When the guitarist Angus Young sounds the warning shots -- three fiercely executed chords -- and the drummer Phil Rudd taps reveille on his cymbals, shake your head and upper torso back and forth in a tension-releasing rush.</p>
        <p>Staying in place, imitate Mr. Young's furious march across the stage as his brother, Malcolm, on second guitar, and Cliff Williams on bass lay down a rhythm so solid it is inseparable from your heartbeat. Absorb the strange allure of Brian Johnson's screechy vocals. As the chorus comes, get ready to chant like a football hooligan. Raise your fist in the air and bellow the incantatory choruses: ''Hell's bells!'' ''Back in black!'' ''I'm on a highway to hell!''</p>
        <p>AC/DC has been a tonic for rock purists since the band first stormed out of its homeland in 1976. Mr. Young's assaultive, deceptively unpretentious guitar-playing inspired speed metal, while the band's shout-it-out song craft influenced both punk and hard rock.</p>
        <p>With 17 albums from which to sample, AC/DC had no need for tricks during its two-hour set, a precursor to a sold-out performance on Friday at Madison Square Garden. A blunt delivery of hits from ''Let There Be Rock'' to ''You Shook Me All Night Long'' and pleasant enough selections from its new album, ''Stiff Upper Lip'' (Elektra), provided the necessary jolt.</p>
        <p>But AC/DC is as famous for its onstage excess as for its basic music. The band pulled out its usual arsenal on Thursday: a monumental Angus Young statue whose red horns and beady eyes glowed in tribute to its live model's demonic persona; a bell Mr. Johnson tolled at the start of ''Hell's Bells''; platforms that raised Mr. Young into the air as he played;  and the six cannons that offer the traditional salute at the finale.</p>
        <p>The show didn't stimulate the imagination so much as give it a chiropractic whack. The same was true of the songs it celebrated, which jovially promoted the old-fashioned (say Neanderthal) view of male and female attributes.</p>
        <p>The crudeness AC/DC affects is admired because it is clearly chosen. Angus Young has fleet enough fingers to play the mock Bach other 1970's metal guitarists turned into a bad joke; intertwined with his band's power chords his parts were often graceful and intricate. But he puts on his schoolboy outfit and hoists out those trademark riffs because he believes rock is most effective when appealing to the libidinal core.</p>
        <p>Even haughty art-rockers agree with this in some bone in their bodies, and AC/DC hits it every time.</p>
        <p>One famous rocker duly impressed by AC/DC, the guitarist Slash, snagged the opening slot on this tour. When Slash was in Guns 'n' Roses, he rose to fame on the strength of music that was half rough assault and half lyrical fantasia. With Axl Rose, his erratic, wildly creative partner, now playing the hermit, Slash has organized his band, Snakepit, to serve his lazier muse. The group's songs had punch, but not enough focus. Perhaps it can learn from its obsessive Australian role models.</p>
