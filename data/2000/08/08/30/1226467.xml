        <p>His campaign has kept careful count. When Gov. George W. Bush goes to Springfield High School in Holland, Ohio, outside Toledo on Thursday, he will be making his 100th visit to a school since he began running for president 14 months ago.</p>
        <p>It is predictable what he will say, because he says it at almost every stop almost every day, rain or shine, no matter the audience, even when he has only 5 or 10 minutes to speak.</p>
        <p>It goes like this: ''This nation of ours must challenge what I like to call the soft bigotry of low expectations. Every child can learn. It starts with raising people's sights and raising expectations and refusing to yield, refusing to accept a curriculum that won't work.''</p>
        <p>Five years after the Republican Congress shut down the government in part because of the money President Clinton wanted to spend on education, four years after Bob Dole embraced a Republican platform that advocated abolishing the Department of Education, Mr. Bush has made an expanded federal role in education a central campaign issue.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, for his part, has responded to the challenge  on an issue that has been especially strong for Democrats ever since President Lyndon B. Johnson got the first law on federal aid to public schools enacted 35 years ago over the opposition of most Republicans.</p>
        <p>''I think it's time to make revolutionary improvements in our public schools the No. 1 priority in the nation,'' Mr. Gore declared in a speech last week in Chicago to the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners.</p>
        <p>While both candidates are emphasizing education, their approaches are quite different.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush focuses on making schools more accountable for their students' performance, and talks about the importance of local control. The modest additional spending he proposes would go primarily toward a program to help disadvantaged children learn to read.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, by contrast, would increase federal spending on education by 50 percent, $115 billion over the next decade. He would have the federal government contribute money to raise teachers' salaries -- an area Washington has always shunned -- and large amounts would be spent on  preschool programs and school construction.</p>
        <p>Each candidate has abandoned party dogma to move to the center.</p>
        <p>Before the Republican convention  last month, Mr. Bush intervened with the party's platform committee to knock out language that called for closing the Department of Education. Instead, Mr. Bush would expand the department's authority by giving it jurisdiction over Head Start, the preschool program for poor children that is now in the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has also expressed a more limited advocacy of vouchers than the conservatives of his party have. Many Republicans in Congress would like to give all parents vouchers to help pay their children's tuition at private schools. Mr. Bush would allow vouchers only if a school failed for three years to make the improvements needed to meet state standards, after repeated warnings.</p>
        <p>''Under Bush, education has come of age for Republicans,'' said Denis Doyle, a political scientist and a  founder of Schoolnet.com, a company that provides Internet services for school districts. ''On education, Mr. Bush looks more like Mr. Gore than he looks like Mr. Dole.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore emphasizes stiffer standards for teachers, a position not likely to be met enthusiastically by the teachers' unions, which are important Democratic constituents. More than 300 delegates at the Democratic convention were members of the National Education Association or the American Federation of Teachers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would require all new teachers to pass qualification tests. He would ensure that all secondary school teachers have college majors or minors in the subjects they teach and that all primary school teachers are trained in teaching reading. Teachers would have to pass rigorous evaluations to keep their licenses. And communities would be encouraged to develop procedures for discharging poor teachers and assigning teachers to particular schools based on expertise rather than just seniority.</p>
        <p>Mary Elizabeth Teasley, director of government relations for the National Education Association, said her union was ''in perfect alignment with the vice president.''</p>
        <p>But her union's members might not feel that way. For example, when Mr. Gore spoke last spring to the Michigan Education Association, he was vigorously applauded when he described his plans for recruiting teachers and increasing salaries. But his remarks about making teachers more accountable were met with icy silence.</p>
        <p>Polls show that Mr. Bush's strategy has helped close a gap between Republicans and Democrats on education. In 1988, when Mr. Bush's father was running for president, 55 percent of those questioned in a New York Times/CBS News poll said Democrats were more likely to improve education; 23 percent said Republicans were. In answer to the same question last month, the Democrats' lead narrowed, with 45 percent of respondents favoring Democrats' chances of improving education and  33 percent the Republicans'.</p>
        <p>Both candidates offer a ream of specific policy proposals. Mr. Bush would spend $1 billion a year for five years to train teachers to diagnose and correct reading problems. Just last week, he offered modest proposals to build and repair schools on and near military bases and to give grants to historically black and Hispanic colleges.</p>
        <p>He would penalize states with a loss of 5 percent of their federal aid if they did not give standardized reading and math tests to students in the third through the eighth grades and publish the results.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would spend $50 billion over 10 years to provide public preschools for all 4-year-olds and many 3-year-olds. He would offer interest-free bonds for school construction and modernization, provide money for raising teacher pay, award signing bonuses to recruits and give tax credits to offset the cost of college for students from families with incomes below about $100,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Oddly, given Mr. Gore's assertions in recent weeks about the specificity of his policy proposals, his campaign was unable this week to provide a breakdown of exactly how the $115 billion extra he intends to spend on education over the next 10 years would be allocated.</p>
        <p>In any event, the precise policy proposals of the candidates are less important than the principles they espouse. That is because Congress develops education programs and is likely to devote approximately the same amount of resources to education regardless of who is president.</p>
        <p>But Washington's influence on public education could depend on who is elected. Mr. Gore would have the government much more involved in local education matters. Mr. Bush would mostly keep his hands off except for holding schools responsible for the progress of their students.</p>
        <p>The emphasis on education in this year's campaign, far greater than in any recent presidential race, is odd for two reasons.</p>
        <p>First, the federal government is a relatively minor player in education compared with the state and local governments. The $23.5 billion Washington is spending this year on public schools is only 7 percent of the schools' $340 billion in total spending.</p>
        <p>Second, there is no evidence that the public is paying significantly more attention to education this year than in the past. Polls have shown all year that 5 percent to 10 percent of the voters say education is the most important problem facing the government. About the same percentage of voters rank health care, Social Security, Medicare or taxes first.</p>
        <p>Politicians often think of education as a women's issue, and both candidates are making special appeals to women. But Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll, said surveys showed that women were no more concerned in a political sense about education than men were.</p>
        <p>''Education is one of those issues that fills a vacuum,'' Mr. Newport said, something for the voters and  the candidates to talk about in a year when no overriding issue like the economy or international tensions is dominating the debate.</p>
        <p>The issue is also appealing to the candidates because a politician's position on education, unlike, say, on health care or taxes or trade policy,  is unlikely to generate strong opposition from commercial interests with deep pockets.</p>
        <p>Mainly what seems to have happened this year is that Mr. Bush felt comfortable with education as an issue, having dealt extensively and, by most accounts, successfully with the matter as governor of Texas, and he began promoting his positions early in the campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has long talked about improving education. But members of his staff acknowledged that the unusual emphasis Mr. Bush placed on the issue was probably what led the vice president to proclaim that it was now the nation's top priority.</p>
