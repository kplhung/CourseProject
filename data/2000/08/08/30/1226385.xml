        <p>Camera-Obscuring On Campaign Trail</p>
        <p>The action at Junior's Restaurant in Brooklyn yesterday wasn't only at the counter, where REPRESENTATIVE RICK A. LAZIO, the Republican candidate for the United States Senate, sat down for breakfast (scrambled eggs and Junior's specialty, cheesecake) in front of a dozen camera operators with professional credentials and equipment.</p>
        <p>Off in a corner, one of Mr. Lazio's aides was twisting and turning to block a young man with a home video camera and a pocket tape recorder -- ERIC SCHULTZ, an employee of the New York State Democratic Committee. Mr. Schultz, above right, was trying to capture the moment, and Mr. Lazio's conversation, for the benefit of HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON'S campaign, so that if her advisers ever declared, ''Let's go to the videotape,'' they would have one to go to.</p>
        <p>There was not much to see on yesterday's tape, though. Every time Mr. Schultz leaned sideways or stretched on tiptoes to get a better shot of Mr. Lazio, the Lazio aide, CHIP LAKE, above left, moved to block Mr. Schultz with either his body or a copy of Mr. Lazio's daily schedule.</p>
        <p>This strained dance was the latest chapter in Mr. Lazio's uncomfortable relationship with the youngish people the Democrats have dispatched to record his public appearances.</p>
        <p>The use of these kind of aides, known as trackers, has become standard among Republicans and Democrats. Most campaigns have, in the name of detente, decided to ignore them. For a while, Mr. Lazio did, too, once even offering Mr. Schultz a MetroCard. But as the race has tightened, the cold war has begun in earnest.</p>
        <p>''Why make it easy for them?'' said DAN McLAGAN, the Lazio campaign's communications director, who said that Mr. Lazio would not do the same thing to Mrs. Clinton. ''We're flattered by the attention. But witnessing these kind of seedy 'Big Brother' tactics kind of makes you want to take an extra shower of the day.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, CATHIE LEVINE, dismissed the Lazio campaign's objections. ''I don't know what Rick Lazio is afraid of,'' she said. ''Tracking is done in almost every political campaign. What is Rick Lazio hiding?''</p>
        <p>Not Half Bad With Ketchup</p>
        <p>The question for the man who wrote the book about the man who ate the 747 -- yes, ate the 747 -- was: What does a 747 taste like, anyway?</p>
        <p>But BEN SHERWOOD, the author of -- you guessed it -- ''The Man Who Ate the 747'' (Bantam) seemed not to have firsthand knowledge.</p>
        <p>''In my own life,'' he said, ''I've not had the need to eat landing gear.'' This was after he said: ''I did a huge amount of research. I spent a great deal of time speaking to the world's greatest omnivore, Michel Lotito. He has eaten nine tons of metal in the last 30 years.'' Including, Mr. Sherwood said, a Cessna. (Sure enough, The Guardian -- among other European newspapers -- reported Mr. Lotito ate the four-seater in Venezuela in 1978.)</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sherwood, a senior broadcast producer for ''NBC Nightly News With Tom Brokaw,'' said his book was a love story. It is about romance and would-be romance, but it is also about his love of the Guinness Book of World Records -- ''my favorite book as a boy.''</p>
        <p>''I was fascinated by the lengths people will go to to achieve that tiny moment of greatness,'' he said. And so he wrote a novel about a man who tried to do just that by grinding up a 747 and consuming it.</p>
        <p>''I am told by competitive eaters and medical experts that if it's properly pulverized, you can eat anything,'' he said. But as for eating an airplane, ''I don't believe it will pass muster with the surgeon general, the National Transportation Safety Board or the Federal Aviation Administration.''</p>
