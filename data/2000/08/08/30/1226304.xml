        <p>WINE drinkers in this country learn early on about the Maconnais region  in southern Burgundy. Its dry, clean white wines are generally reliable and inexpensive, and, for a beginner, offer a fallback when choices are otherwise overwhelming. It's as easy to point to a bottle of Macon-Villages at the wine shop as it is to ask for a glass of chardonnay at a restaurant.</p>
        <p>Macon producers are likewise learning about American wine drinkers. They now frequently add the word ''chardonnay'' to the Macon label, since that is, after all, the white grape of the Maconnais and Burgundy. And few words are so alluring to American wine consumers.</p>

        <p>WINE drinkers in this country learn early on about the Maconnais region  in southern Burgundy. Its dry, clean white wines are generally reliable and inexpensive, and, for a beginner, offer a fallback when choices are otherwise overwhelming. It's as easy to point to a bottle of Macon-Villages at the wine shop as it is to ask for a glass of chardonnay at a restaurant.</p>
        <p>Macon producers are likewise learning about American wine drinkers. They now frequently add the word ''chardonnay'' to the Macon label, since that is, after all, the white grape of the Maconnais and Burgundy. And few words are so alluring to American wine consumers.</p>
        <p>A majority of Macons are made by large cooperatives intent on maximizing production, and thus fill the beginners' market. But some Macon wines are made by small quality-minded producers, and exhibit a delightful concentrated fruitiness that is fresh and deep, crisp and satisfying. Wines like the Thevenet listed below and the Petit Chapeau (which comes from property owned by the celebrated Domaine des Comtes Lafon of Meursault) offer much more than reliability: they offer pleasure, which beginners can enjoy as much as anyone else.</p>
        <p>Macons shipped to the United States are generally labeled Macon-Villages or Macon followed by the name of a particular village, like Macon-Pierreclos. Also from the Maconnais are wines labeled St.-Veran and Pouilly-Fuisse, which are more expensive but not always better.</p>
        <p>The artisanal Macons are not always better, either. Some taste so powerfully of oak that I can only imagine that the winemakers fancied that they were making expensive white Burgundies. In Burgundy, such wines theoretically balance the oak with equally powerful fruit flavors, but in the warmer, flatter Macon the depth of flavor rarely exists. The wines I like best are made either without oak or with just a little bit of it to round out the flavor of the grapes.</p>
        <p>The first three of these six wines are significantly better than the others, though all are more interesting than the run-of-the-mill Macon.</p>
        <p>JEAN-CLAUDE THEVENET, MACON-PIERRECLOS 1998: $12  Perfumed fruit and anise aromas; both fruity and earthy.</p>
        <p>PETIT CHAPEAU, MACON-VILLAGES 1998: $15  Brilliant citrus aromas; clear fruit flavors, with richness and depth.</p>
        <p>DOMAINE ANDRE BONHOMME, MACON-VIRE, CUVEE SPECIALE 1998: $16  Round, ripe fruit aromas; razor sharp flavors; dry and refreshing.</p>
        <p>JOSETTE ET JEAN-NOEL CHALAND, DOMAINE DES CHAZELLES,  MACON-VIRE 1998: $14  Aromas of yeast and apples; deep, rich flavors; long finish.</p>
        <p>MERLIN, MACON LA ROCHE VINEUSE 1998: $13  Zippy citrus and apple aromas; creamy texture.</p>
        <p>VERGET, MACON-VILLAGES, TETE DE CUVEE 1998: $14  Round and oaky with a creamy texture but lacking fruit.</p>
        <p>Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various Manhattan wine shops.</p>
