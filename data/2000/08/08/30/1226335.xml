        <p>A group of Western investors, including Wilbur L. Ross, a specialist in corporate rescues, and the American International Group, plan to increase their investment in three financial affiliates of the Hyundai Group to $1 billion so as to gain a firmer hold on Hyundai Securities, South Korea's largest brokerage house.</p>
        <p>The increased investment of $200 million, on top of $800 million announced in June, would give the group -- which also includes GE Capital, an American subsidiary of Aegon of the Netherlands and the Wisconsin and California pension funds -- a 23.7 percent stake in the brokerage firm. Hyundai Securities is the plum in the deal: its profit nearly tripled in the last year, to 305.2 billion won -- now almost $275 million.</p>
        <p>But foreign investors will face a daunting task in trying to revive the troubled money management arm of the group. The unit, Hyundai Investment Trust and Securities Company, has liabilities exceeding its assets by 1.2 trillion won, or $1.08 billion.</p>
        <p>Like other such investment businesses in South Korea, the problems at Hyundai Investment Trust worsened after the Daewoo Group collapsed under $80 billion of debt. Investment trusts are the largest purchasers of corporate bonds in South Korea.</p>
        <p>Some Korean shareholder activists said today that they were also concerned by signs that Hyundai Securities would retain its current head, Lee Ik Chi, who in the past has been accused of misappropriating investors' funds to prop up ailing units of the Hyundai Group.</p>
        <p>If any steps were taken to ensure Mr. Lee's position, ''it would be deeply troubling,'' said Jang Ha Sung, a prominent advocate for minority shareholder rights and professor of business administration at Korea University. ''No one knows what was behind the deal.''</p>
        <p>The Hyundai Group, South Korea's largest business conglomerate, is trying to reduce its $48 billion in debt by selling stakes in its affiliates to foreign investors. Through a tangled web of equity holdings and debt guarantees in other subsidiaries, South Korea's giant family-run conglomerates have propped up ailing units through cash infusions from healthier affiliates. For the Hyundai Group, its brokerage firm served as the main source of such funds.</p>
        <p>Hyundai's government-led creditors in recent weeks have stepped up demands for a revamping in an attempt to stamp out such practices.</p>
        <p>''Cash-flow problems at Hyundai Investment Trust Securities expanded liquidity problems to the entire group,'' said Kim Kyoung Won, a spokesman for Hyundai Securities, which owns a 24.2 percent stake in the Hyundai Investment Trust. ''But through the A.I.G. investment, this problem has been solved.''</p>
