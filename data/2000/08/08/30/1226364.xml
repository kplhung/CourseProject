        <p>Disputing suggestions that his campaign was hesitant to commit to prime-time presidential debates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said today that he wanted all of his debates with Vice President Al Gore to be held in evening hours when television audiences were largest.</p>

        <p>Disputing suggestions that his campaign was hesitant to commit to prime-time presidential debates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said today that he wanted all of his debates with Vice President Al Gore to be held in evening hours when television audiences were largest.</p>
        <p>''The idea of saying I don't want to debate on prime time is ridiculous,'' Mr. Bush, the Republican nominee for president, told reporters aboard his campaign plane this morning. ''I want as many people to watch our debates as possible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who has agreed to three debates with Mr. Gore, added, ''I would welcome all three being in prime time.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush and his aides said he was not yet prepared to agree to any of the three 90-minute forums proposed by the Commission on Presidential Debates, an independent, bipartisan group that has been the prime sponsor of general-election presidential debates in the last three elections.</p>
        <p>Instead, they said that Mr. Bush was considering debate proposals from 53 organizations, including television networks, newspapers and  Web sites. And they left open the possibility that the governor might not agree to any of the three debates proposed by the commission.</p>
        <p>''There's more than just the commission debates,'' Mr. Bush said. ''There are a lot of opportunities.''</p>
        <p>Janet Brown, executive director of the commission, said that since the group began sponsoring debates in 1988, every presidential candidate from a major party has participated in at least one of its forums.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush made his remarks about the debates today in response to a New York Times article reporting that his aides have resisted the commission's series of debates, saying they were reluctant to commit to three prime-time debates on the major television networks. One other option the aides suggested was a debate on a Sunday morning public affairs program.</p>
        <p>It is traditional for front-runners to be slow about agreeing to debates, and until very recently, Mr. Bush was running well ahead of Mr. Gore in most national polls. But since the Democratic convention two weeks ago, the race has tightened considerably. And now, many Democrats believe Mr. Bush runs the risk of appearing defensive when he hesitates on debates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's campaign has seized on the issue to try to paint Mr. Bush as faint-hearted about facing off against the vice president on issues. Today, Mr. Gore's campaign formally accepted all three of the commission debates in a news release that also pointedly noted that Mr. Bush has yet to commit to any of the commission forums.</p>
        <p>''We firmly believe that the commission's proposal offers the best opportunity for the most Americans to see the candidates in the most effective forum to debate their views,'' William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, said in a letter to the commission.</p>
        <p>Today, the Bush campaign suggested that one reason they have declined to accept the commission debates is that they want greater control over details of the forums.</p>
        <p>''As the Republican nominee, he feels both the responsibility and the right to have some input into the format of those debates to ensure that they are thoughtful and they are substantive,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director.</p>
        <p>She added that Joseph Allbaugh, Mr. Bush's campaign manager, and Andrew Card, a Bush adviser, would travel to Washington on Friday to meet with commission officials, as well as television network representatives, to discuss possible debates.</p>
        <p>During his in-flight news conference, Mr. Bush said he might have problems with certain debate formats. ''Sometimes the formats lend themselves to who best can walk around the stage, act dramatically,'' he said. ''I'd rather have a good discussion.''</p>
        <p>Asked what kind of format he has felt most comfortable with, Mr. Bush said, ''The ones that were more free flowing.'' He added, ''Larry King was good,'' a reference to a primary debate on CNN's ''Larry King Live.''</p>
        <p>The governor became somewhat testy when repeatedly pressed by reporters about his position on prime-time debates, saying at one point, ''I can't say it more clearly. I said it yesterday. I was hoping you all heard me yesterday. Evidently, some didn't. When I say I welcome the new prime-time debates, it's what I mean.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown said that ''candidate input on format is clearly something the commission would want to be sensitive to.'' But she added that the dates, times, formats and locations of the commission's three proposed debates were the result of 18 months of research ''to try to determine what's in the best interest of the public.''</p>
        <p>This afternoon, Mr. Bush traveled to Portland, Me., where he appeared with a middle-class family of five that he said would pay no federal income taxes under his sweeping tax-cut proposal, but would have to pay more than $900 a year in federal taxes under Mr. Gore's more modest tax-reduction plan.</p>
        <p>He also appeared at a middle school to promote his ideas for revamping public education. This evening, he attended a fund-raiser in Portsmouth, N.H., that was expected to raise $300,000.</p>
