        <p>Congress has become a crucial battleground this election year with Republicans trying to strengthen their slim majority in the House and Democrats battling to overturn it. New Yorkers are beginning to see some evidence of this struggle in several key primaries to be held September 12.</p>
        <p>Southern Suffolk County, 2nd District. The seat relinquished by Representative Rick Lazio to run for the United States Senate has become one of the key swing districts nationally for both parties. On the Republican side, Joan Johnson, town clerk of Islip, offers a high-profile choice over Robert Walsh, a retired banker. Mrs. Johnson, an African-American, was featured prominently at the Republican convention. With her strong community credentials and moderate views on social issues, Mrs. Johnson would be the better nominee.</p>

        <p>Congress has become a crucial battleground this election year with Republicans trying to strengthen their slim majority in the House and Democrats battling to overturn it. New Yorkers are beginning to see some evidence of this struggle in several key primaries to be held September 12.</p>
        <p>Southern Suffolk County, 2nd District. The seat relinquished by Representative Rick Lazio to run for the United States Senate has become one of the key swing districts nationally for both parties. On the Republican side, Joan Johnson, town clerk of Islip, offers a high-profile choice over Robert Walsh, a retired banker. Mrs. Johnson, an African-American, was featured prominently at the Republican convention. With her strong community credentials and moderate views on social issues, Mrs. Johnson would be the better nominee.</p>
        <p>The Democratic primary pits two solid candidates against one another -- David Bishop, minority leader of the Suffolk County Legislature, and Steven Israel, majority leader of the Huntington Town Board. Mr. Bishop has a number of key party endorsements, but we recommend Mr. Israel for his broader knowledge of national and international affairs and his ability to forge bipartisan solutions.</p>
        <p>Brooklyn-Queens, 9th District. After a promising first term, Representative Anthony Weiner is being challenged in the Democratic primary by City Councilman Noach Dear. Mr. Weiner has fought energetically for gun control, noise abatement of airlines and relief for abused women. Both candidates support campaign finance reform. Mr. Weiner voted for the Shays-Meehan bill last year, and Mr. Dear promises to support it if elected.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dear, an ardent conservative on many issues including abortion and gay rights, is also listed on the Republican line in this district. On the Democratic line, we recommend Mr. Weiner.</p>
        <p>Brooklyn, 10th District. Representative Edolphus Towns is being challenged by Barry Ford, a Harvard-trained lawyer who did well against the Congressman in a three-way race two years ago. Mr. Towns has a powerful organization in this district, but after 18 years, his record in Congress has been minimal and his support for tobacco and other special interests is troubling. For that reason, we endorse Mr. Ford, an energetic community activist who wants educational improvements, school construction and an empowerment zone.</p>
        <p>Brooklyn, 11th District. Una Clarke, who cannot run for re-election to the City Council, has turned to the district seat now being held by her former mentor, Representative Major Owens, congressman for ed the area since 1982. Mr. Owens has not kept up with his constituent services, making him vulnerable to someone who has been a formidable voice in the city on women's and immigrant issues. Both sides have turned this into an excessively bitter contest. However, Ms. Clarke campaigns under the shadow of a $48,000 fine from the city's campaign finance board that remains unresolved. For this reason, we recommend Mr. Owens.</p>
