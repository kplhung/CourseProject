        <p>TBWA in New York and Hakuhodo in Tokyo said yesterday that they had formed a joint venture solely for worldwide advertising communications for the Nissan Motor Company in Tokyo. Billings for the worldwide account were estimated at more than $1 billion.</p>
        <p>The new venture, G1 Worldwide in Tokyo, is a result of a plan by Nissan announced last fall to consolidate advertising at one agency partner to create a coherent global brand message. Robert LePlae, 40, managing director at the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWAChiatDay, part of the TBWA unit of the Omnicom Group, where he oversaw the Nissan and Infiniti accounts, will lead worldwide operations at G1 as president and chief executive. Takashi Ohashi, a general manager at Hakuhodo, becomes chairman.</p>

        <p>TBWA in New York and Hakuhodo in Tokyo said yesterday that they had formed a joint venture solely for worldwide advertising communications for the Nissan Motor Company in Tokyo. Billings for the worldwide account were estimated at more than $1 billion.</p>
        <p>The new venture, G1 Worldwide in Tokyo, is a result of a plan by Nissan announced last fall to consolidate advertising at one agency partner to create a coherent global brand message. Robert LePlae, 40, managing director at the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWAChiatDay, part of the TBWA unit of the Omnicom Group, where he oversaw the Nissan and Infiniti accounts, will lead worldwide operations at G1 as president and chief executive. Takashi Ohashi, a general manager at Hakuhodo, becomes chairman.</p>
        <p>G1 will have three regional management units: in Europe, TBWAG1 soon-to-be centralized in Paris, will be led by Philip Purdon, 38, as chief executive; in Japan, HakuhodoG1 in Tokyo will be led by Mr. Ohashi as president; and in North America, TBWAG1 in Playa del Rey will be led by Michael Allen, 36, as managing director.</p>
        <p>Previously, both agencies had handled the account: the majority of work in Japan was handled by Hakuhodo; in North America and Europe, most work was created by TBWA offices. TBWA, or predecessor agencies, have been involved in other joint ventures with Hakuhodo, including an agency 50 percent owned by each, TBWAH in Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>G1 is 50 percent owned by Hakuhodo and 50 percent owned by TBWA, formerly called TBWA Worldwide. The regional offices in Europe and North America are 80 percent owned by TBWA and 20 percent owned by Hakuhodo; the one in Japan is 80 percent owned by Hakuhodo and 20 percent owned by TBWA.</p>
