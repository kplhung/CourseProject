        <p>At 14, Tiffany should be worrying about pimples and braces. But she is also facing a stark choice between possible infertility and possible death. When her father presses her to explain the pain caused by her uterine cancer, she responds in a tone conveying daughterly indulgence and annoyance. ''It's like someone stabbing me from inside,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Her reaction and her father's restrained grief were recorded on small digital video cameras held by television producers. So was the moment when the surgeon called Tiffany's parents to deliver his not very optimistic diagnosis, and so was the surgery that removed Tiffany's uterus.</p>
        <p>It might once have seemed shocking to be privy to such intimacies, but we are growing accustomed to the idea that no life should go unexamined -- in front of a national audience. Tonight at 10 ABC News presents Tiffany's story and others in the first episode of ''Hopkins 24/7,'' a six-part documentary series that has captured three months of life and death at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. The hospital gave the producers unprecedented access to its inner workings, though not, of course, unrestricted access. There are no segments on really unpleasant topics like medical malpractice, for example.</p>
        <p>The program continues tomorrow at 10 and Wednesday nights through Sept. 27 at 10.</p>
        <p>''Hopkins 24/7'' makes for fascinating television while rewriting our notion of the patient-doctor privilege. Before filming, but after obtaining permission from the Hopkins administration, the program's producers printed up notepad-size release forms that they could hand out like parking tickets to patients who seemed like promising subjects. One of the producers, Terence Wrong, told me that he was surprised at how many people (about 85 percent, he estimates) signed away their privacy. If the immediate celebrity conferred on ''Survivor'' contestants has a ripple effect, we may soon see agents clamoring to represent patients as they head for the operating room.</p>
        <p>Our major medical centers have increasingly doubled as stage sets for documentary television crews. It started on cable with the Learning Channel's ''Trauma: Life in the E.R.,'' the channel's top-rated program (which New York Times Television produces for TLC), now beginning its fifth season. A few ''Trauma'' alumni worked on ABC's new program.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 25 TLC is adding ''Code Blue,'' filmed in Charity Hospital in New Orleans, to its schedule, which also includes a program called ''Paramedics,'' about emergency medical teams. On Sept. 28 the Discovery Channel begins its ''Hospital,'' filmed at the Duke University Medical Center, opening with the story of a man who crashed his motorcycle while riding without his helmet and then suffers paralysis.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's the filmmaker Frederick Wiseman pioneered the use of cameras to examine our major institutions (including Metropolitan Hospital in Manhattan, in the original ''Hospital''). ''Hopkins 24/7'' pays homage to Mr. Wiseman's subtle, observational approach, but it is part of a more recent trend that combines cinema verite with the conventions of dramatic narrative. These real stories are carefully edited to give them a structure especially recognizable to devotees of prime-time dramas like ''N.Y.P.D. Blue'' or of course ''E.R.,'' with major and minor characters and intercutting story lines.</p>
        <p>To achieve this, the ''Hopkins'' producers spent three months filming -- amassing 900 hours of videotape -- and six months editing. As Mr. Wrong said, ''Buried within Mr. Wiseman's cinema verite techniques are moments of pure gold, but mainstream network audiences wouldn't have the patience to wait for them.''</p>
        <p>Most of the narration for ''24/7'' comes from doctors, patients and family members. Occasionally Sylvia Chase, a correspondent for ABC News, tersely relays scene-setting information, but off camera. This is a welcome deviation from network newsmagazine convention, which requires information to be filtered through on-air correspondents whose celebrity becomes a distraction.</p>
        <p>The program covers an extraordinary range of medical problems (including cancer, anorexia, brain disorders, organ transplants) and personalities whose diversity at times seems too good to be true (but is). In one segment we meet Dr. Michael Ain, a surgeon and a dwarf, who candidly discusses the discrimination against him because of his size. He specializes in operating on children and other little people who can look at him eye to eye. In another we meet Dr. Rick Montz, a leading oncologist (the kind your mother might call a ''top man''). He's also a middle-aged ponytail wearer who revels a bit too smugly in his own iconoclasm (describing ovarian cancer as ''bad juju'').</p>
        <p>Tonight's episode introduces Eddie Cornwell, a handsome surgeon with a messianic streak. He is determined to stop the flow of bleeding young men who stream into the Hopkins emergency room from the streets of East Baltimore, which delivered 362 shooting victims in one year. So he takes boys on hospital tours, giving them (and us) a close look at what a buff fellow looks like after he has been shot and had a colostomy. One youth, looking horrified at the man's pulpy stomach region, mumbles, ''I'm going to stick to basketball.''</p>
        <p>The cameras capture the adrenalin charge of the emergency room, but also the quiet tension of patients making decisions using information they can't possibly comprehend. In one episode, just as a woman's 3-year-old daughter is about to undergo surgery, the mother learns that more than half her child's brain has to be removed, more than previously expected. The mother insists on talking to the surgeon, and asks asks, ''What does the basal ganglia do?'' Later the child's father gives his reason for deciding to trust the doctor: ''I know he prays before every surgery.''</p>
        <p>The doctors, however, aren't presented as gods, but as very human. The producers show us a ''morbidity and mortality'' conference -- which feels like a combination confessional, teaching seminar and trial -- where doctors candidly discuss their mistakes. Back on rounds, we watch residents stumbling from sleep deprivation and take pause. One of them, a woman who drops out of the macho surgery program in her third year, confesses that 12 hours into her 60-hour shift she cares ''very much'' for patients. At 24 hours she still cares, but not as much. After that, she cares -- about her own misery.</p>
        <p>To their credit, the producers of ''24/7'' have tried to err on the side of humanism, not exploitation. While the prime-time newsmagazines endlessly chase the latest outrage -- no matter how slight -- this crew has followed another journalistic tradition of reportage that doesn't expose, but reveals.</p>
