        <p>When David Chase decided to delay the new season of ''The Sopranos'' to March instead of January, HBO was faced with a hole on its Sunday night lineup. Coincidentally, Tom Fontana, the creator of HBO's other high-rated drama, ''Oz,'' had been told by his production studio in Manhattan that, as he put it, ''They were kicking us out.'' Mr. Fontana's elaborate prison set for ''Oz'' takes up 60,000 square feet and only had a year-by-year lease.</p>
        <p>''They got an offer for a 10-year lease from New York 1,'' Mr. Fontana said, ''Which, ironically enough, is a Time Warner sister entity.''</p>

        <p>When David Chase decided to delay the new season of ''The Sopranos'' to March instead of January, HBO was faced with a hole on its Sunday night lineup. Coincidentally, Tom Fontana, the creator of HBO's other high-rated drama, ''Oz,'' had been told by his production studio in Manhattan that, as he put it, ''They were kicking us out.'' Mr. Fontana's elaborate prison set for ''Oz'' takes up 60,000 square feet and only had a year-by-year lease.</p>
        <p>''They got an offer for a 10-year lease from New York 1,'' Mr. Fontana said, ''Which, ironically enough, is a Time Warner sister entity.''</p>
        <p>Faced with the loss of his space, Mr. Fontana asked whether HBO wanted him to produce his next eight episodes of ''Oz'' early. Chris Albrecht, the president of original programming for HBO, responded immediately, saying that the network had that hole in its January schedule coming up, and that ''Oz'' would fit in nicely.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Fontana kept his show in production and this week will finish shooting the eight new episodes of ''Oz'' that will begin in January. The series had previously played only in the summer. The January season will also reflect the growing respect the show is enjoying by including appearances by guest stars like Luke Perry, Roger Rees, Ally Sheedy and Betty Buckley.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile HBO is also shooting a pilot for a dark comedy from Alan Ball, writer of ''American Beauty.'' This one, called ''Six Feet Under,'' is about the funeral business.</p>
