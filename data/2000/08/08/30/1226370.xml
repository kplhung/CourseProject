        <p>Facing a state deadline for submitting a long-term plan to cut spending, the Nassau County executive is near agreement with a county police union on a new contract that would raise police salaries 20.5 percent during the next five years, county officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, has made no public comment on the talks. Officials familiar with the negotiations said the raises for nearly 3,000 rank-and-file officers, already among the highest paid in the country, would be coupled with proposed savings of $60 million during the five-year period, or $12.5 million each year, reducing the total increase in police costs to about 2 percent a year.</p>

        <p>Facing a state deadline for submitting a long-term plan to cut spending, the Nassau County executive is near agreement with a county police union on a new contract that would raise police salaries 20.5 percent during the next five years, county officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, has made no public comment on the talks. Officials familiar with the negotiations said the raises for nearly 3,000 rank-and-file officers, already among the highest paid in the country, would be coupled with proposed savings of $60 million during the five-year period, or $12.5 million each year, reducing the total increase in police costs to about 2 percent a year.</p>
        <p>But leaders of the Democratic-controlled County Legislature and the Republican county comptroller, Frederick E. Parola, said they questioned the salary increases and the promised savings. ''Until you see the whole package, you're looking into a dark hole,'' Mr. Parola said.</p>
        <p>Judith A. Jacobs, the Democratic majority leader in the Legislature, said: ''We have not seen a contract. Until we do there is no way we can be aware of what we are really looking at here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, could include the savings in informal plans he is to submit Tuesday to Frank G. Zarb, who heads the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, a state panel created in March by Gov. George E. Pataki to oversee the financially troubled county. Mr. Gulotta has until Sept. 15 to submit a formal four-year plan and a proposed budget for 2001 to the state board and the County Legislature.</p>
        <p>Officials with knowledge of the police talks said that the savings would result from replacing uniformed officers with lower-paid civilians in 110 positions, as well as attrition, reduced police overtime and other measures still under discussion with the union, the Nassau County Police Benevolent Association.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Gulotta, Dianne Baumert-Moyik, said that if a deal was struck, it would be ''the first time that the county and the P.B.A. have come to an agreement that avoids the risk and the uncertainty of binding arbitration.''</p>
        <p>In July, police officers in Suffolk County won an arbitration award granting them a 20 percent increase over four years. The Nassau union is now in the last year of a four-year contract.</p>
        <p>For police officers, a voluntary agreement would avoid contract uncertainties they might face if the state panel took over as a financial control board, a step it is required to take if county efforts to reduce current and projected budget deficits fall short.</p>
        <p>Republicans and Democrats in the County Legislature said they were skeptical the proposed police savings were real. Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader, said the salary increase would be ''ridiculous when we have one of the highest-paid police forces in the United States and a county that is teetering on the edge of financial collapse,'' with a budget deficit of more than $200 million.</p>
        <p>But the police union president, Gary DelaRaba, said he was ''a little amazed at how people come out against something without having all the facts.''</p>
        <p>Gary Lewi, a spokesman for the Nassau Interim Financial Authority, said Mr. Zarb would not comment on police contract talks or Nassau deficit-reduction efforts until the authority received a proposal in writing.</p>
        <p>Other employee unions in Nassau are also awaiting the plan. ''Every day I wake up apprehensive about what is going on in Nassau County,'' said Anthony P. Giustino, the president of Local 830 of the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents 11,000 county employees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giustino said the union had already made concessions that wiped out salary increases this year. Its current five-year contract, which raises salaries 18.5 percent, expires in 2002, but the largest increases will come in the remaining years. He said he worried that a financial control board would withhold the increases.</p>
        <p>Lisanne G. Altmann, a Democratic county legislator, said she expected that Mr. Gulotta's financial plans would be flawed, compelling the Legislature to make the hard choices, including a probable increase in property taxes. ''It's clear the Legislature is caught in the squeeze play now,'' she said. ''It's becoming obvious that we are going to have to raise taxes in order to avoid a financial control board.'' Democrats hold a one-vote majority in the 19-member Legislature.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmitt said Republican members wanted to cut spending but not raise taxes. ''She gives up much too easily,'' Mr. Schmitt said. ''Raising taxes is the easy way out.''</p>
