        <p>A federal judge has ruled that Texas' system for administering preventative medicine and certain other health care for children in Medicaid programs is badly flawed, and he has ordered the state to make improvements.</p>
        <p>The judge, Senior Judge William Wayne Justice of Federal District Court, found that the state had not lived up to the terms of a 1996 consent decree or provided appropriate health care under federal law to more than 1.5 million children eligible for Medicaid.</p>

        <p>A federal judge has ruled that Texas' system for administering preventative medicine and certain other health care for children in Medicaid programs is badly flawed, and he has ordered the state to make improvements.</p>
        <p>The judge, Senior Judge William Wayne Justice of Federal District Court, found that the state had not lived up to the terms of a 1996 consent decree or provided appropriate health care under federal law to more than 1.5 million children eligible for Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Most of the ruling was focused on the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment program, which exists, the judge said, ''to ensure that poor children receive comprehensive health care at an early age, so that they will develop fewer health problems as they grow older.''</p>
        <p>But Judge Justice, in a ruling filed on Aug. 14, found, among other things, that the state had failed to educate indigent families about available treatments and had not provided transportation to see doctors.</p>
        <p>The judge also found that the managed care plans that serve about 1 in 3 Texans on Medicaid have not provided appropriate care. He cited inadequate and incomplete medical checkups by health maintenance organizations and other managed care plans, and said that in some cases H.M.O.'s had improperly blocked children's access to specialists.</p>
        <p>In one example, the judge cited testimony about a 17-month-old boy who had been treated for ear infections 17 times. After treating the boy three more times, the boy's new primary care doctor sought permission from the family's Medicaid H.M.O. to send his patient to an ear, nose and throat specialist. The request was turned down because the primary care provider had not treated the boy six times in the past six months, as was required by the H.M.O.</p>
        <p>The class-action lawsuit was filed in 1993 on behalf of Texas children eligible for Medicaid. About 1.4 million children in the state do not have health insurance, according to public-interest groups, and about 600,000 of those are eligible for Medicaid.</p>
        <p>The ruling comes as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential candidate, has faced accusations of striking inadequacies in the state's health care for poor and uninsured children.</p>
        <p>Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush's office, said the state was spending more money on Medicaid outreach programs.</p>
        <p>''We believe it is important for children to receive preventative health care,'' Ms. Edwards said.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit originally resulted in the 1996 consent decree meant to improve health care for indigent children. But earlier this year, lawyers for the plaintiffs returned to federal court in Austin to argue the state was not living up to the decree.</p>
        <p>Susan Zinn, the lead plaintiff lawyer, noted that last year Texas lawmakers enacted a moratorium on expanding managed care into any new areas of the state.</p>
        <p>''The judge's finding on managed care confirms that the state does not yet have its house in order,'' Ms. Zinn said.</p>
        <p>Carolynn Singleton, a registered nurse who owns four North Texas clinics that serve mostly poor patients, described the state system as chaotic a very difficult for indigent patients to navigate.</p>
        <p>''Most are worried about keeping their lights and water on, not whether their child has immunizations or health care,'' said Ms. Singleton, who testified in the suit. The system, she said, ''imposes too many barriers that isolate them from that care.''</p>
        <p>Andrea Horton, a spokeswoman for the attorney general's office, said that the state had not decided whether to appeal and that it was too soon to say what remedies might be proposed. Ms. Horton declined to comment about the judge's characterizations of the state's system, but pointed to court filings by the state that contend that the state's efforts are adequate.</p>
        <p>According to those filings, the state made almost five million ''outreach'' contacts to clients last year; the budget for medical transportation has increased by 300 percent; and a $7.6 million contract for Medicaid outreach services is the largest in the United States.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zinn noted that lawmakers including Governor Bush have pushed tax cuts, money that could have gone toward health care.</p>
        <p>The tax cuts pushed by Mr. Bush have become a political issue as the state has run into a larger than expected budget shortfall, due in part to higher Medicaid expenses from rising prescription costs.</p>
