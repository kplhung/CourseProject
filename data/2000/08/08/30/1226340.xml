        <p>Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, the grandfatherly face of Hindu nationalism, is having health problems, and they are creating unease here in India's capital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vajpayee, 75, known abroad as the man who raised fears by ordering tests of nuclear devices two years ago, is revered at home as a consensus builder. On Sunday, he cut short his appearance at the national convention of his political party, the Bharatiya Janata, and returned to New Delhi from central India. After resting at home on Monday, he returned to work today and presided over a cabinet meeting.</p>
        <p>The government said in a statement on Monday that the prime minister's doctors had advised him to stay off his feet because of a flare-up of osteoarthritis that was causing severe pain in his knees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vajpayee's spokesman, H. K. Dua, said that the prime minister would still depart on Sept. 5 for a week and a half in the United States that will include a New York visit and an address to Congress, as well as separate meetings with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and a trip to Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p>''The idea is to keep up the momentum of improved Indo-U.S. relations,'' Mr. Dua said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vajpayee has seemed more frail and slow-moving recently. After he finished his Independence Day speech earlier this month, his security men had to lift him up and carry him down from the Red Fort ramparts. Three months ago, he canceled engagements because of what his doctors described as a sore throat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vajpayee, who leads the second-most-populous nation in the world, may be suffering from nothing more serious than the discomforts of old age, but rumors that he has a life-threatening illness persist.</p>
        <p>His health is central to the stability of the coalition government his party leads. He has attracted an eclectic group of secular political allies by setting aside his party's hard-line Hindu nationalist positions on issues like the construction of a Hindu temple on the site of a demolished Muslim mosque. But even more than his stance on any given issue, his accommodating style is widely seen as the glue that holds together the oddly fitting pieces of the coalition.</p>
        <p>In recent months, journalists have openly asked about the prime minister's health. Reporters who met him on Sunday when he landed at the airport bluntly asked if he had any serious health problems.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vajpayee laughed and said no. During an interview last November he gave the same answer when asked whether he was sick. First, he burst out laughing, then said he had no grave disease. ''Age is a serious problem,'' he added wryly.</p>
        <p>Despite his shakiness on his feet, Mr. Vajpayee demonstrated his firm grip on the Bharatiya Janata Party at the convention in Nagpur in central India. His choice for party president, Bangaru Laxman, took office this weekend. Mr. Laxman, the first party president from a formerly untouchable caste, had not been the front-runner until the prime minister anointed him.</p>
        <p>Some party leaders and members of hard-line Hindu nationalist groups associated with the party criticized the government for failing to protect Hindu pilgrims in Kashmir from a recent terrorist attack. Some also said India had been too willing to enter negotiations with anti-India militants who want Pakistan included in talks about Kashmir.</p>
        <p>In his absence on Monday, the party unanimously adopted a resolution supporting his decision to attempt negotiations with the Hizbul Mujahedeen in Kashmir -- talks that were aborted after Hizbul called off its cease-fire on Aug. 8. In more belligerent tones, the party also warned Pakistan to halt its support to militants in Kashmir, although Pakistan denies giving such support.</p>
        <p>''A clear message needs to be sent to terrorists and their masters across the border that every Indian life is precious and will be defended, and that indulging in cross-border terrorism cannot continue to remain a cost-free option,'' the resolution stated.</p>
