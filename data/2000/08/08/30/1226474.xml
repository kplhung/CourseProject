        <p>Andre Agassi came to this Open occupied with more thoughts than just defending his singles title. In a taped interview with CBS, broadcast after his first-round victory over Alex Kim Monday night, Agassi discussed his sister's and mother's battle with breast cancer and how it has been tough to maintain concentration in preparing for the Open.</p>
        <p>''It has been a difficult year in many respects with my sister having breast cancer and my mom was diagnosed with it just a month ago,'' Agassi said. ''It hasn't been easy, but in many ways it has gotten the family stronger and close. And it has given me the perspective, that unfortunately sometimes only certain tragedies can bring, that I am trying to utilize in a positive way. My concentration hasn't been the easiest, but I think it is getting better.''</p>

        <p>Agassi indicated that he still wanted to play the Open because he realizes, at age 30, he has few opportunities left to win the event.</p>
