        <p>The Knicks, still searching for depth in the frontcourt, have an interest in Dickey Simpkins, a free agent who has played most of his six-year career with the Chicago Bulls. Simpkins, a 6-foot-9-inch power forward/center, is best known for serving as a part-time bruiser and screen setter for Michael Jordan during the Bulls' run to the 1996, 1997 and 1998 championships.</p>
        <p>The Knicks could sign Simpkins with their $2.25 million midlevel exception or offer him a minimum contract worth $736,000. It may take the larger sum to acquire Simpkins, since the Los Angeles Lakers also have an interest in him and are believed to be his first choice.</p>
