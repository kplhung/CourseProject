        <p>The German economy expanded at its fastest rate in years during the second quarter, further increasing the chance that the European Central Bank will raise interest rates when its board of governors meets on Thursday. The government reported that the economy grew 1.1 percent in the three months ended in June, compared with the quarter a year earlier; that translates to an annualized growth rate of more than 4 percent. Exports remained the biggest source of expansion and received support from the weak euro, which makes German goods cheaper in world markets. But consumer spending expanded as well, suggesting the beleaguered economy may finally be reviving.</p>
