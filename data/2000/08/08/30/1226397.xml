        <p>Unsolicited Offer Is Made For London Stock Exchange  OM Gruppen, the owner of the Stockholm stock exchange, began a $1.2 billion hostile bid for the much larger London Stock Exchange, touching off the first ever takeover fight for an exchange. The London exchange then postponed its Sept. 14 shareholder vote on its planned merger with the Frankfurt exchange.</p>
        <p>The Frankfurt exchange indicated it was willing to consider changing the terms of its agreement with the London exchange into ''a friendly takeover'' instead of a merger. And the London exchange could also draw interest from the Euronext alliance of the Paris, Belgian and Dutch exchanges. [Page C4.]</p>
        <p>Companies to Set Up a Linux Lab  In a validation of the growing popularity of Linux, Intel, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and several other companies plan to announce today that they will jointly create and finance a laboratory for developing and testing advances in the operating system. [C5.]</p>
        <p>Consolidation Seen in Wine Industry  The Foster's Brewing Group's $1.14 billion acquisition of Beringer Wine is likely to prompt a wave of consolidation among California's premium wineries. Analysts and industry executives said the deal effectively puts every significant independent wine maker in play, like Kendall-Jackson and Robert Mondavi. Shares of Beringer rose $10.25, to $55.31. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Speedy Deal Lifts AT&amp;T Shares  Shares of AT&amp;T rose on the news that the company had incorporated Excite@Home into its operations more quickly than expected, suggesting a speedier move into high-speed Internet services. Investors bid AT&amp;T's stock up $1.13, to $32. But Standard &amp; Poor's said that it had put the company's debt on review for a possible downgrade. [C5.]</p>
        <p>Dow and S.&amp; P. Slip; Nasdaq Rises  Stocks ended mixed, with banks and airlines mainly lower while some technology issues made modest gains. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.74 points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,215.10. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index slipped 4.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,509.84. The Nasdaq composite index finished up 11.58 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,082.17. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Home Sales Surged 14.7% in July  Sales of new single-family homes surged 14.7 percent in July, well above expectations, and the consumer confidence index dipped slightly but remained close to the record. [C2.]</p>
        <p>The Power of Contrary Thinking  Poppy King says her mother brought her up to think differently -- a quality that has proved to be both a blessing and a liability in her life. But it was certainly a blessing when it led her to start up Poppy Industries, an Australian cosmetics and lingerie company. Her biggest passion is flea markets, vintage stores and bric-a-brac. The Boss. [C7.]</p>
        <p>Investors to Raise Stake in Hyundai  A group of Western investors, including Wilbur L. Ross, a specialist in corporate rescues, and the American International Group plan to increase their investment in three financial affiliates of the Hyundai Group to gain a firmer hold on Hyundai Securities, South Korea's largest brokerage firm. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Travel Agents Find Way to Adapt  Although hundreds of small travel agencies have gone out of business as airlines sharply reduced commissions, smart travel-management companies, which charge fees for services rendered rather than depending on commissions, are prospering by offering specialized services, especially for corporate travel.
