        <p>The old Atlas Terminals industrial park, on Cooper Avenue in Queens, has long had a knack for reinventing itself. But the park's latest transformation efforts are unlike anything its late founder, Henry Hemmerdinger, might have imagined.</p>
        <p>Atlas Terminals sprouted from a warehouse that Mr. Hemmerdinger bought in 1922. The 25-acre park reached its heyday in the early 1950's, when it was home to brand names like the General Electric Company and New York Telephone.</p>
        <p>The 40- and 50-year tenants are long gone at Atlas, as are the railroad cars that once carried some 60 loads a day across eight miles of track. Manufacturing firms still take up about a third of the park's one million square feet of commercial space. But for years, Atlas, in the mostly residential Glendale area, has pursued a number of market niches that have given it a diverse, if mostly local, mix of tenants.</p>
        <p>Those tenants, housed in 42 buildings, include warehouses for college textbooks, plastic bags, carpeting and lighting, as well as companies that make art frames, telephone calling cards, and even European pastries.</p>
        <p>Atlas has had some notable victories lately. For one, the park is 92 percent occupied, up from just 75 percent during the recession of the early 1990's. Moreover, it has been able to replace the many knitting firms that left in recent years with medical firms like Mason Medical Products, a manufacturer of mattresses, slings and medical foam cushions. At 130,000 square feet, Mason is the industrial park's largest tenant.</p>
        <p>Over the last 18 months, Atlas has also been able to woo roughly a half-dozen small businesses that used to be in Manhattan, says George Rozansky, the park's manager.</p>
        <p>Yet despite such successes, Atlas Terminals's survival skills are still being tested.</p>
        <p>For example, even with relatively modest rents that start at just $5.75 a square foot per year for industrial space, the turnover rate at Atlas remains ''fairly high,'' said H. Dale Hemmerdinger, the grandson of Atlas's founder and the president of the Manhattan-based Atco Properties and Management. He said industrial tenants in New York are continuing to leave for areas where costs are lower, like New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rozansky said he is negotiating with several Long Island City companies about a possible move. However, one obstacle has been the lack of a nearby subway stop at Atlas; the closest station, at Metropolitan Avenue on the M line, is less than two miles away, or about a three-minute trip by bus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rozansky and the executives at Atco are trying to woo textile firms that are being squeezed out of Manhattan's garment district. So  far, they have attracted two small shops. They also want to begin marketing their complex as a home for  Internet companies and ''telecommunications hotels,'' which house telecommunications and data equipment.</p>
        <p>On this front, they hope to get sizable help from a broadband fiber-optic network being installed at the park by Verizon Communications. The electronics for the network are already in place in a building next to a 50,000-gallon water tower. The tower itself has been wired for cellular service and will soon be able to handle wireless Internet service.</p>
        <p>Retailers represent another surprising change at Atlas these days.  The park now has four such tenants, three of which came aboard during the last two years. This fall, the park's two newest retailers -- a coffee bar and an 8,200-square-foot Chinese restaurant -- are expected to open for business on Cooper Avenue, not far from another Atlas tenant, a thriving pet supply store. According to Mr. Rozansky, Atlas is signing up retail tenants at about $15 a square foot; he said retail space in Glendale commonly goes for $15 to $20 a square foot.</p>
        <p>To accommodate the Chinese restaurant, Atlas Terminals embarked on its largest renovation project in a decade. It involved overhauling a century-old, drive-in trucking building that needed a new facade, openings for storefront windows and doors, and an 18-space parking lot. The structure also needed a new concrete floor, to replace sections that were still made of dirt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hemmerdinger said his firm remains a long-term investor at Atlas Terminals, a commitment that requires continual modernizations. Renovations have included replacing roughly a quarter of the park's crumbling brick facade, installing two new boiler systems, and replacing roughly 150 windows a year.</p>
        <p>A relative newcomer to the park is Werner Rees, a tenant who runs a baking goods distributorship, as well as a wholesale and retail bakery called Bavarian Alps Konditorei Pastries.</p>
        <p>In January 1999, Mr. Rees moved his business from a 5,000-square-foot site in Richmond Hill to a 10,000-foot space at Atlas. As part of the move, he invested $400,000 in an ultramodern bakery that now provides pastries to 14 airlines.</p>
        <p>''I looked at other properties,'' Mr. Rees said, ''but the rent here was reasonable, and I like the service. Also, it's centrally located. I'm only 10 minutes from the airport.''</p>
