        <p>GRANITAS are the most primitive frozen desserts, reportedly originating in imperial Rome, where Alpine ice was mixed with fruit juice to make a crunchy, cold treat for the emperors. They have the flavor of sorbet if not the creaminess, and they take very little work and even less equipment to make.</p>
        <p>But don't expect smooth texture from  granitas; that's not what they're about. Granitas are most similar to the shaved ice  served on some New York street corners in the summer -- totally refreshing but hardly elegant. While shaved ice is just that, with overly sweet, artificially flavored syrup  poured over it, a granita is a frozen flavored liquid. When you make it yourself, you control the quality of the ingredients, and, of course, the level of sweetness.</p>

        <p>GRANITAS are the most primitive frozen desserts, reportedly originating in imperial Rome, where Alpine ice was mixed with fruit juice to make a crunchy, cold treat for the emperors. They have the flavor of sorbet if not the creaminess, and they take very little work and even less equipment to make.</p>
        <p>But don't expect smooth texture from  granitas; that's not what they're about. Granitas are most similar to the shaved ice  served on some New York street corners in the summer -- totally refreshing but hardly elegant. While shaved ice is just that, with overly sweet, artificially flavored syrup  poured over it, a granita is a frozen flavored liquid. When you make it yourself, you control the quality of the ingredients, and, of course, the level of sweetness.</p>
        <p>All you need is a freezer, an ice tray or shallow bowl and a fork or spoon to make granitas, but they do require a little attention. You must stir them every half-hour or so while they're in the freezer, to keep large chunks of ice from forming. The ideal granita is a slushy blend of juicy crystals in ice-cold liquid. It attains this texture after about two hours of freezing, and will retain it for a couple of hours more with occasional stirring.</p>
        <p>If you pack a granita in a tightly sealed container and keep it frozen, it will hold for a week or more. You can get it to return to something approaching its original texture by letting it thaw slightly and raking through it with a fork (or pulsing it several times in a food processor). But I suggest making granitas the day you plan to eat them.</p>
        <p>Flavor combinations for granitas are unlimited. Fruit or citrus juices, coffee or chocolate, and fruit purees or juices are best. You can also take granitas further and  add a little coffee to your chocolate (or vice versa), or try making them with a sweetened brewed tea, like jasmine or Earl Grey. Or you can simply freeze a sweetened canned juice like pineapple. But don't use pieces of fruit, which will become unpleasantly hard when frozen.</p>
        <p>To speed the process, chill the bowl or tray before adding the liquid. The broader the tray, the faster the mix will freeze.</p>
        <p>COFFEE GRANITA  Time: 15 minutes, plus 2 to 3 hours' freezing</p>
        <p>3 cups freshly brewed strong coffee</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sugar, or to taste  1 tablespoon cocoa powder, optional.</p>
        <p>1. Stir coffee, sugar and cocoa together; taste and add more sugar if necessary.</p>
        <p>2. Pour mixture into shallow metal or glass pan or bowl. Freeze about 30 minutes, or until ice crystals begin to form at the edges. Gently stir the crystals back into the liquid, not breaking them up entirely.</p>
        <p>3. Continue to stir and break up clumps of crystals every half-hour or so. When the entire mixture has the texture of soft crushed ice, it's ready to serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
        <p>LEMON OR LIME GRANITA  Time: 15 minutes, plus 3 to 4 hours' freezing</p>
        <p>3/4 cup sugar, or to taste  1 cup freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice  1 tablespoon minced or grated lemon or lime zest.</p>
        <p>1. Bring 1 cup water to a boil. Mix the sugar with the boiled water, and stir to dissolve. Add another cup of water, and combine with the citrus juice and zest. Taste, and add more sugar if necessary.</p>
        <p>2. Pour the mixture into a shallow metal or glass pan or bowl. Freeze for about 30 minutes, or until ice crystals begin to form at the edges of the container. Gently stir the crystals back into the liquid, not breaking them up entirely.</p>
        <p>3. Continue to stir and break up clumps of crystals every half-hour or so. When the entire mixture has the texture of soft crushed ice, it's ready to serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Variation: For chocolate granita, increase the sugar to 1 cup and substitute 1 cup good-quality cocoa powder, a tiny pinch of salt and 1 teaspoon vanilla for the citrus juice and zest. Heat 3 cups water to just before the boiling point, and whisk in all the ingredients. Proceed as directed in Steps 2 and 3.</p>
