        <p>Al Gore has been doing better. But there's still a lot of skepticism about whether his angry populism can work.</p>
        <p>The times seem out of joint for inflaming the haves and the have-nots. And the vice president, sporting a moussed 'do and those heathery polo shirts, hardly looks like Willie Stark.</p>
        <p>How do you stir up the masses in an America where the masses are fat and sated? If you call self-indulgent yuppies to the barricades, will they  follow, or will they hang back, sipping their Claret Bordeaux Wine Casked Islay Single Malt (aged 12 years), talking on their 70-mile-range cordless phones, lounging in their Hammacher Schlemmer hammocks, making reservations at spa.com?</p>
        <p>Speaking for yuppies everywhere, I say, bring on the class war! Just make it first class.</p>
        <p>That is the beauty of yuppies: We are greedy, but never gratified.</p>
        <p>It will be easy for the vice president to tap into boomer angst and Schadenfreude. As we have been reminded by the current mania for ''Survivor''-type shows thrive on manipulation, humiliation and Darwinian machination, a prosperous country is a sadistic country.</p>
        <p>As Jacques Barzun writes about the Marquis de Sade in ''From Dawn to Decadence'': ''A sadist does not simply enjoy inflicting pain; he is a blender of ecstasies.'' In other words, a prosperous country is a decadent country, in pursuit of easy pleasure and easy pain. More breeds the desire for more.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore can't win simply by firing the ire of the poor and middle class because there aren't enough of them any more. (Besides, not enough of them vote or give soft money). He needs to find a way to incite the yuppies, who like to think of themselves as middle class anyway.</p>
        <p>It is not as hard as it seems. Mr. Gore simply has to pit the have-nots and haves against the have-it-alls.</p>
        <p>He needs to pit the masses of instant millionaires against the economic royalty of instant billionaires.</p>
        <p>Even though yuppies are rolling in it, they long to feel like the obstreperous, striving, anti-bourgeois afflicters of the comfortable they think they once were.</p>
        <p>They may have dodged the Vietnam War, they may feel their parents were the Greatest Generation, but here at long last is a war they can get into: a faux class war.</p>
        <p>But EveryAl is on the wrong track, crusading to help seniors get cheaper arthritis pills. If he is going the drug route, he should be helping yuppies get the prescription drugs they rely on to smooth out the stress of pampered lives -- Xanex, Zoloft, Valium and Ritalin. EveryAl will have to work harder at playing on arriviste envy,  reminding yuppies of all the luxury items they still don't have.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for him, new needs are being invented everyday. He just has to point out to yuppies that, as F.D.R. once put it, they are relatively ill-housed, ill-clothed, and ill-fed. Not to mention ill-shod, ill-transported and ill-wived. Out there in America, EveryAl should be asking:</p>
        <p>Does your toddler toddle in Gucci baby booties?</p>
        <p>Do you sashay in cashmere denim and merino worsted suits with 22-karat gold-thread pinstripes (beaten into leaf), the same kind King Fahd of Saudi Arabia used to cover the seats of his Boeing 747?</p>
        <p>Do you display your octopus and black squid in a custom cylindrical architectural aquarium?</p>
        <p>Do you live on your own island? Do you get there on your own Dassault Falcon 2000 Jet? Does someone butle on the island? Does the butler clean with a Miele limited-edition platinum vacuum cleaner?</p>
        <p>Do you have your own offshore bank?</p>
        <p>Does your third country home have a fine 19th century honey-colored limestone chimney piece with gothic detailing over a concave frieze carved with five foliate bosses, and jambs carved with trefoil arches? I mean, does it?</p>
        <p>Did 'N-Sync play your kid's first communion? Did Britney do the bris?</p>
        <p>For crying out loud, do you have your own moat?</p>
        <p>Trophy wives for everyone! Even women. Soccer moms especially.</p>
        <p>You don't need George W. Bush if you have your own personal tax consultant to dodge and shelter you.</p>
        <p>''A flat TV in every pot!'' EveryAl should cry. ''You shall not crucify mankind on an 18-karat-gold-plated cell phone (hand-placed diamonds optional)!''</p>
