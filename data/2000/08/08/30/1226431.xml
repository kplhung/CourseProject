        <p>GetMusic, the online site owned by two big music labels, Bertelsmann and Seagram's Universal Music group, is getting out of selling music. GetMusic plans to announce today that it is entering five European countries, but the music sales will be handled by Bertelsmann's BOL unit. GetMusic is also looking for a company to take over the music store it now runs on its original site in the United States, perhaps CDNow, the ailing company that Bertelsmann agreed to buy last month, said Andrew Nibley, GetMusic's chief executive. Mr. Nibley asserted that GetMusic, with 1.2 million users, had strong prospects as a media company, earning money from advertising. For now, it is the No. 1 site for Internet users under the age of 12, thanks largely to its close ties to Britney Spears and N Sync.</p>

        <p>TECHNOLOGY BRIEFING: E-COMMERCE  Correction:  August 31, 2000, Thursday  A report in the Technology Briefing column of Business Day yesterday about GetMusic, an Internet site owned by Bertelsmann and Seagram, misstated the site's plans for music sales. It is considering finding another company to handle sales of compact discs in the United States, but it has not made a final decision to do so, and it still intends to sell music through computer downloads. It is not getting out of selling music.</p>
