        <p>The Credit Suisse Group is expected to announce today that it plans to buy Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a Wall Street investment bank, for about $12.8 billion, according to people involved in the negotiations.</p>
        <p>An acquisition by Credit Suisse of Donaldson would be the second buyout of a Wall Street firm by a Swiss bank this summer and it would expand Credit Suisse's presence in financial markets in the United States and Europe.

        <p>The Credit Suisse Group is expected to announce today that it plans to buy Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a Wall Street investment bank, for about $12.8 billion, according to people involved in the negotiations.</p>
        <p>An acquisition by Credit Suisse of Donaldson would be the second buyout of a Wall Street firm by a Swiss bank this summer and it would expand Credit Suisse's presence in financial markets in the United States and Europe. The bank already owns Credit Suisse First Boston, an investment banking unit that has become a powerhouse in underwriting Internet companies and other technology stocks in the last few years. Adding Donaldson would make First Boston the leading underwriter of high-yield, or junk, bonds, and a top-ranked underwriter of stocks and provider of merger advice to corporations.</p>
        <p>Credit Suisse is offering to pay $45 cash and $45 in stock to AXA S.A., the French financial services conglomerate that owns 72 percent of Donaldson, and $90 in cash for the rest of Donaldson's shares, people involved in the negotiations said. Credit Suisse is setting aside another $1.2 billion in a bonus pool to be used to retain employees, those people said.</p>
        <p>Shares of Donaldson, Lufkin shot up early yesterday as rumors of an imminent buyout swept around financial markets. Shares of Donaldson rose $16.44, to $82.25. Shares of DLJDirect, which track the firm's online trading business, rose $2.25, to $10.19.</p>
        <p>Spokeswomen for Donaldson, Lufkin and First Boston declined to comment.</p>
        <p>But according to people involved in the negotiations, the deal came together quickly over the last few weeks. In documents drawn up by investment bankers, Donaldson was referred to by the code name ''diamond.'' One of those documents estimated that together the two firms would have ranked fifth among United States securities firms last year with combined net income of $1.8 billion. In the first half of 2000, they would have had net income of $1.2 billion, the document showed.</p>
        <p>AXA would wind up owning about 8 percent of Credit Suisse. Analysts and investors said that AXA had been looking for a buyer for Donaldson to reduce the volatility of its earnings and possibly to raise cash to expand its insurance and money-management businesses. AXA is the majority owner of AXA Financial, formerly known as the Equitable Life Insurance Company. AXA Financial in turn is the majority owner of Alliance Capital, a fast-growing mutual fund company.</p>
        <p>The buyout would spell the end for Donaldson 40 years after it was founded by three partners who used stock research as the foundation for building an independent investment bank. The name is likely to disappear as the firm's operations are merged with First Boston's. The online stock-trading unit, DLJDirect, will be renamed CSFB Direct, the people said.</p>
        <p>Joe L. Roby, the chief executive of Donaldson, would become chairman of First Boston's executive committee. First Boston's chief executive, Allen Wheat, would run the combined investment banking operations.</p>
        <p>Analysts said they were concerned about the amount of overlap between the two firms' investment banks. People involved in the negotiations said the merger was expected to yield about $1 billion in annual costs savings by 2002.</p>
        <p>Lauren Smith, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said she had ''mixed feelings'' about the proposed deal. ''It certainly would help their market shares,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But ''culturally, there could be some clashing,'' she said. ''D.L.J. is more conservative and has a partnership-type feel.''</p>
        <p>Donaldson traditionally has been one of the most generous firms on Wall Street. It pays out a higher percentage of its revenues -- about 54 percent last year -- to its employees than most other firms.</p>
        <p>The deal is starkly different from the proposed $12 billion acquisition of PaineWebber Group by another Swiss bank, UBS A.G. That deal, announced seven weeks ago, would give UBS a nationwide network of brokers to sell the stocks and mutual funds created by its investment bankers. UBS executives said they planned to operate PaineWebber, the fourth-largest brokerage firm in the United States, as a separate unit of the company and expected minimal overlap between the two firms.</p>
        <p>First Boston and Donaldson are essentially competitors in the creation, sale and trading of investment products. Both firms rank high in the underwriting and trading of stocks, especially those of young companies in fast-growing industries, like technology, telecommunications and health care.</p>
        <p>For several years, Donaldson has dominated the junk bond business, an area of expertise it started building a decade ago by hiring salesmen and traders from Drexel Burnham Lambert, the defunct firm that was home to junk-bond financier Michael R. Milken in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Lately, that specialty has not served Donaldson so well. The market for junk bonds has been in a protracted slump. At the same time, a bigger investment bank, Goldman Sachs has made a big push into the business. So far this year, Goldman has raised more money for clients by selling junk bonds than any other firm has.</p>
        <p>By paying a premium to buy Donaldson, Credit Suisse is making a big bet that the market for junk bonds will rebound strongly. Combined, the two firms would stand atop the junk-bond underwriting rankings, known on Wall Street as league tables.</p>
        <p>David J. Williams thinks Credit Suisse is making a smart wager -- but then, he is biased. Mr. Williams manages the Excelsior Value and Restructuring Fund, which owns about 275,000 shares of Donaldson stock. ''I think junk bonds are a screaming buy in here,'' Mr. Williams said. ''But I bought it because it was cheap. The moral of the story is it pays to buy cheap stocks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams said he thought $90 a share was a fair price for Donaldson because it amounted to about three times the firm's book value, or the value of its assets minus its liabilities. Three times book value is considered the going rate for securities firms. UBS is paying slightly more than that for PaineWebber.</p>
