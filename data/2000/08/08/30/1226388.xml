        <p>The doctor charged last weekend with smothering her elderly parents in Chatham Township, N.J., was being treated for manic-depression about this time last year, court records show. And today, lawyers for the Harvard-educated urologist, Dr. I. Kathleen Hagen, said that they were developing a defense based on her mental condition.</p>
        <p>Gaunt, stooped and looking exhausted, Dr. Hagen shuffled into a Morris County courtroom in shackles and manacles today for her first appearance in the case. Her lead lawyer, Gerard Hanlon, said she had only a general understanding of the charges. She was held in $2.5 million bail by Judge N. Peter Conforti, pending a psychiatric evaluation.</p>
        <p>''We've all been around,'' Mr. Hanlon said after a brief hearing. ''I think we can all recognize a disturbed and distraught woman when we see one.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hagen, 54, seemed barely to notice the proceedings, but toward the end of her brief appearance, when Mr. Hanlon patted her lightly on her back, she raised her downcast yes for a moment, leaning slightly and briefly toward his shoulder.</p>
        <p>Saturday, the Morris County prosecutor, John B. Dangler, charged Dr. Hagen with asphyxiating her mother, Idella Hagen, 92, and father, James Hagen, 86, as they lay in their beds in their dilapidated home in Chatham. The police said Dr. Hagen had lived in the house with the bodies for several days until she called Saturday to report the deaths.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanlon told reporters today that Dr. Hagen was aware that her parents were dead, but that she had been withdrawn and unresponsive during his two interviews with her, and he had managed to get little information. He said the defense would raise her mental condition as an issue, but was not more specific.</p>
        <p>''Obviously there is a state-of-mind issue here that is huge,'' he said. ''Something is wrong.''</p>
        <p>From court records and conversations with people who know Dr. Hagen, a picture  emerged today of a brilliant, driven woman who pushed herself to stand out in a field  dominated by men when she graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1973. But in middle age she found herself twice divorced,  alone and unemployed, her own health precarious as she struggled to care for elderly  parents with little help but their dwindling savings.</p>
        <p>''She said she was going to have to start supporting her parents,'' her first husband,  Peter A. Cook, said from his home in New Hampshire, recalling an out-of-the-blue phone call she made to him this summer, after years of silence between them.</p>
        <p>''She made some allusions to her parents' retirement money, about it being finite, and that unless she sold the house, she was going to be in trouble,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The house, Mr. Cook said, was an inn on St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands that Dr. Hagen bought and restored with William Tyrrell, her second husband, whom she married in 1984, five years after an amicable divorce from Mr. Cook. She put herself on part-time status at the University of New Jersey College of Medicine, where she was teaching and practicing.</p>
        <p>She made frequent trips to the inn, where Mr. Tyrrell remained, until 1992, when the venture failed and the couple moved to Rumson, N.J. There, Mr. Tyrrell became a business executive, and Dr. Hagen gave up teaching and practicing medicine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyrrell moved out of their house in 1995, after losing a leg in a motorcycle accident, and two years later Dr. Hagen sued for divorce in Monmouth County Court on grounds of abandonment. According to court records, they were divorced in 1997, and Mr. Tyrrell agreed to pay her $65,000 a year until the end of 1999, or until she remarried or got a job paying more than $80,000 a year. Dr. Hagen moved into her parents' home in July.</p>
        <p>In September 1996, a year after her husband had moved out, Dr. Hagen scuffled with officers trying to keep her from entering a go-go bar in Easton, N.J. She had called the bar several times to say she intended to perform a birthday dance on the bar for Mr. Tyrrell. She later filed a federal suit accusing the Easton police of violating her civil rights.</p>
        <p>In court documents related to the suit, her physician, Dr. Michael D. Walsh of Long Branch, submitted a medical history saying that she suffered from a thyroid condition and from bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depression, and was taking lithium. A message on Dr. Walsh's office phone today said he would be away until next week.</p>
        <p>The symptoms of manic-depression are cyclical, and it is not known if Dr. Hagen was still being treated for it. Her lawyer, Mr. Hanlon, said today that he believed she had been taking medication until recently, but he did not know what kind, or for what ailment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanlon said Dr. Hagen told him that she had not slept for more than a few minutes at a time since she moved in with her parents, and that she had lost 20 pounds. In court today she appeared aged beyond her years, a shock of brightly bleached  hair showing above dark roots.</p>
        <p>After graduating from Harvard Medical School, Dr. Hagen spent six years as a resident at Massachusetts General Hospital, where she was the first woman to specialize in urology. She taught surgery at Harvard Medical School for six years before moving to the New Jersey state medical school, where she became the first woman to head the urology department.</p>
        <p>Her first husband, Mr. Cook, said that from the start, Dr. Hagen had shown a pioneer's determination to succeed in an atmosphere that was not always friendly.</p>
        <p>''She was under intense scrutiny from the higher-ups in the bastions of Boston's medical community,'' he said. ''There's an old boy's club if ever there was one.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''She was the one they watched.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hagen lacked a strong network of friends, Mr. Cook said, and she complained to him years ago that her work at New Jersey's medical school was less and less fulfilling, since it increasingly consisted of  administrative chores.</p>
        <p>''I think she finally got off the treadmill,'' Mr. Cook said.</p>
