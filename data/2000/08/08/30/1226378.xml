        <p>Several organizers and participants in the West Indian American Carnival Parade called on the Giuliani administration to allow beer and wine at the annual event in Brooklyn this Monday.</p>
        <p>Congressman Major R. Owens of Brooklyn and several others accused  Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of applying a double standard by permitting some alcohol to be sold at street festivals, like the 11-day Feast of San Gennaro, held each September in Little Italy, but not at parades.</p>
        <p>New city rules ban all alcohol sales at parades, imposing the same prohibition on the West Indian American Carnival Parade and others as has existed for years at the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''Disappointment and resentment have been growing since the sudden ban was announced earlier in August, less than one month from the West Indian Day Parade,'' Mr. Owens said.</p>
        <p>Although the restrictions are still being negotiated, the mayor has said he is leaning toward limits, but not an outright ban, on alcohol consumption at festivals like San Gennaro, which starts Sept. 14. These limits would include reducing the number of beer and wine vendors, and limiting consumption to certain hours of the day.</p>
        <p>The ban on alcohol at parades came in the aftermath of the June 11 melee in Central Park that followed the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Owens said yesterday that he was not ''philosophically opposed'' to an alcohol ban, adding that he was ''not one who thinks alcohol is needed to have a good time.''</p>
        <p>But he said the ban on sales at parades was an unexpected financial blow to many participants in the Monday's parade. They have traditionally relied on alcohol sales and direct sponsorships from beer manufacturers to defray the costs of elaborate costumes and floats that are a hallmark of the parade.</p>
        <p>''This cuts into our survival,'' said Kenneth Antoine, the leader of a steel band preparing to march in the parade. He said his band's costs for costumes, rehearsals and other expenses would exceed $10,000. The band had planned to cover these costs with a beer concession, and with sponsorships from companies like Guinness and Heineken that have backed out since the alcohol ban was announced.</p>
        <p>In a letter sent to Mr. Giuliani on Aug. 24, Mr. Owens said he had asked that the ban on alcohol be postponed until January. He said yesterday that would allow participants in the West Indian American parade to cover this year's costs, and to plan different fund-raising methods for next year.</p>
        <p>The mayor, at a press conference yesterday in Harlem, responded angrily to Mr. Owens' criticism, and said the ban would not be postponed.</p>
        <p>''I am having a hard time figuring out why any public official that represents any community would want me, now that we've taken alcohol away, to put alcohol back into a parade,'' Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>The mayor strenuously denied Mr. Owens' charge of a double standard, and its implicit suggestion of racism against people from the Caribbean. He repeated a distinction he has made several times in recent weeks between alcohol consumption at parades and festivals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said festivals, where beer and wine are sold from booths, have historically been linked to far fewer accidents, arrests or violent outbreaks than parades.</p>
        <p>He referred directly to the threat of such problems at the West Indian American Carnival Parade, where three deaths occurred last year.</p>
