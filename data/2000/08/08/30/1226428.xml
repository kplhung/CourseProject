        <p>Representative Rick A.

        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio charged yesterday that Hillary Rodham Clinton had deliberately distorted his voting record in Congress, and he prepared to unveil an advertisement today that aides said would feature Senator John McCain harshly challenging Mrs. Clinton's fund-raising practices in New York.</p>
        <p>''I will not be a doormat,'' Mr. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican, declared outside Junior's Restaurant on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, where he had just consumed a breakfast of scrambled eggs, home fries and cheesecake. ''It is fair to criticize my record. It is not fair to make things up about my record.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio made his remarks as both Senate candidates struggled to seize the high ground in the debate over who went negative first, even as both exhibited a level of bellicosity that is highly unusual coming the week before Labor Day, which traditionally marks the start of the full-fledged campaign season.</p>
        <p>The state Democratic Party announced that its new ad on behalf of Mrs. Clinton began broadcasting yesterday. It ties Mr. Lazio to Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, and asserts that Mr. Lazio supported Mr. Gingrich in Congress while expressing opposition to some of his initiatives while campaigning in New York, The ad says, ''Tell Lazio to stop playing both sides.''</p>
        <p>Even as Mr. Lazio complained about Mrs. Clinton's campaign tactics, he prepared to escalate his own offensive with his second attack ad in three days. This one, an adviser said, features Mr. McCain, the Arizona Republican who has championed campaign finance reform, asserting that Mrs. Clinton's embrace of the issue was untrustworthy given her extensive reliance on so-called soft money, the largely unregulated donations raised by party committees and outside groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain is a prime sponsor of legislation in the Senate that would bar the use of soft money. Mrs. Clinton has endorsed the bill. Mr. McCain has also praised Mrs. Clinton this year, saying she would be a Senate ''star'' if elected.</p>
        <p>The McCain ad, as well as another asserting that ''you can't trust'' Mrs. Clinton, will be the two main Lazio TV commercials on the air leading up to Labor Day. Although the ostensible issue raised by the McCain ad is campaign finance, aides to both candidates say there is little evidence that New York voters are particularly interested in that subject. The real purpose of the ad, a Lazio adviser said, is to use a politician popular with New Yorkers to raise questions about Mrs. Clinton's credibility in an area where Republicans and Democrats both believe that Mrs. Clinton is vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Both ads have long been planned, although Mr. Lazio asserted that he was introducing them only in response to Mrs. Clinton's attacks over the last month. She has cited votes he has cast against Democratic initiatives to provide federal financing for hiring teachers, and to expand Medicare benefits to pay for prescription  drug benefits for the elderly.</p>
        <p>''The more down in the mud that they get, the more they distort and spout untruths, the more it's going to be necessary for us to correct our record,'' Mr. Lazio said, adding: ''You know what the story is. She's stuck in the 40's in the polls. They can't win by being positive. They can only win by trying to tear me down.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was on a campaign fund-raising trip in Seattle yesterday. Cathie Levine, her spokeswoman, challenged Mr. Lazio's assertions. ''The day Lazio entered the race he promised to run a positive campaign, and has launched negative attacks against Hillary since his announcement speech,'' she said. ''Maybe it's the drop in the polls. Maybe it's because he can't run on his record on the issues.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides have claimed that Mrs. Clinton was distorting his record; the candidate went further yesterday, suggesting that she was lying. Asked for examples, he noted that she had said he had voted to cut Medicare spending, when in fact he had voted to cut increases in Medicare spending. Republicans and Democrats have long argued over whether it is fair to refer to that vote as a vote to cut spending.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has said she would agree to a ban on soft money if Mr. Lazio tried to force committees not affiliated with his campaign to cease running ads attacking the first lady, a demand that Mr. Lazio's aides have described as unrealistic. Mr. Lazio has criticized Mrs. Clinton for using soft money and has refrained from setting up a committee to raise such money for his campaign. But one adviser said yesterday that it was likely that Mr. Lazio would set up such a committee, and would cite Mrs. Clinton's effort to raise soft money to justify his position.</p>
        <p>With Mrs. Clinton out of town, it fell to State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi to continue her attacks on Mr. Lazio's tax plan. They said he had deliberately underestimated the cost of his plan to distance himself from George W. Bush's. Mr. Lazio's spokesman, Dan McLagan, called those assertions partisan attacks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio attacked Mrs. Clinton after stopping by Junior's, where he had breakfast with Ruth Morris, a Democrat from Brooklyn, among others. With Mr. Lazio in earshot, Mrs. Morris said she did not approve of all the negative campaigning. ''I think they all ought to stop digging in each other's backyards,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Morris also said she might vote for Mr. Lazio because she was unhappy with Mrs. Clinton's failure to get a national health care plan enacted. And her enthusiasm for Mr. Lazio grew after he told her that he would pay for her eggs and home fries. ''We came in here to have breakfast -- and next thing we knew we had an entire contingency from the press,'' she said. ''We asked him to pay. And he did. First thing the Republicans have done for me in a long time.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 1, 2000, Friday  A highlight entry on the television page on Wednesday for the documentary ''The Fall of Newt Gingrich'' misstated Mr. Gingrich's title. He was speaker of the House, not a senator.</p>
