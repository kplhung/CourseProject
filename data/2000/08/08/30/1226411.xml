        <p>Seeking to free more classroom space, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said yesterday he had ordered the city's 32 superintendents to evict  any nonprofit groups, community organizations or police offices from schools if they are not needed for the instruction of students.</p>

        <p>Seeking to free more classroom space, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said yesterday he had ordered the city's 32 superintendents to evict  any nonprofit groups, community organizations or police offices from schools if they are not needed for the instruction of students.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy, in an hourlong back-to-school speech at the New York Press Club, said the move was part of an effort to find classrooms for a system hard pressed to accommodate 1.1 million students in sometimes crumbling buildings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy later acknowledged that he did not know how many organizations would be affected or how much more space would be found. He seemed irritated at the number of classrooms that had been turned over under his predecessors to community groups not performing educational functions.</p>
        <p>The order seemed likely to create  political difficulties, since many of the community groups have powerful elected officials on their boards and had been given space by previous administrations hoping to cement their local support.</p>
        <p>Already, one citywide group, the  Urban League, seemed upset by the new order, even though officials of the Board of Education later said the order would not apply to groups that did work like helping students improve their attendance, as the Urban League does.</p>
        <p>''I think the chancellor really needs to think this policy through very thoroughly and find a way to balance his need for classrooms and also realize that the not-for-profit agencies are valuable partners in helping educate students,'' said Dennis Walcott, president of the New York Urban League.</p>
        <p>The Urban League has run an attendance improvement program, Community Achievement Projects in Schools, for more than 10 years in elementary, middle and high schools in some of the city's poorest areas, including the South Bronx, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Ocean Hill-Brownsville. The group used classrooms, he said.</p>
        <p>Nonprofit agencies and neighborhood organizations also collaborate with the Board of Education to provide educational and cultural programs, including antidrug campaigns, afterschool programs and tutoring.</p>
        <p>The Police Department took over the Board of Education's 3,300 safety officers a year ago. Many of their satellite bureaus are housed in school buildings and Board of Education offices. School officials said the chancellor seemed annoyed that in some schools the safety officers were occupying two classrooms as lounging rooms.</p>
        <p>Tom Antenen, deputy police commissioner for public information, said yesterday that the board agreed to allow the officers to continue to be housed in the schools when the department took over.</p>
        <p>''In a way, it's moot,'' he said. ''They have to supply space for security purposes. We haven't seen anything as far as notices.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said a recent visit to a school in Upper Manhattan prompted his action. He saw two classrooms  occupied by community organizations, and he ordered the superintendent to remove them, he said. He could not recall the name of the school or the district.</p>
        <p>''I've armed the superintendents with eviction notices,'' he said. ''They are to tell me who is left in those buildings, who is not with the board. I want to have an explanation from each superintendent of how they justify that person or that organization in the buildings. We need the space.''</p>
        <p>David Klasfeld, deputy chancellor for operations, said many of the community organizations have had long relationships with the school system, and that some space agreements were appropriate and some were not. He said principals must get his permission if they wanted to maintain space agreements with certain organizations.</p>
        <p>While growth in enrollment has slowed in the last three years, schools in Washington Heights and  parts of Queens and the Bronx are bursting at the seams. Five new schools will open next week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy made the remarks during a wide-ranging talk about his plans for his first full school year as chancellor. He touched on changes in special education, arrangements for students who failed summer school and teacher recruitment.</p>
        <p>He said most of the certified teachers needed to fill vacancies at some of the city's worst-performing schools had been hired. Officials scrambled to find qualified teachers for the schools last week after settling a lawsuit with Richard P. Mills, state education commissioner. Mr. Mills sued to force Mr. Levy to comply with an agreement to hire certified teachers for 94 schools.</p>
