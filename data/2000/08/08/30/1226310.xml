        <p>AT Beaucaire, near Nimes in the south of France, the Durand family operates two wineries.

        <p>AT Beaucaire, near Nimes in the south of France, the Durand family operates two wineries. One is a typical modern winery producing red, white and rose wines under the Chateau des Tourelles label. The other is a re-creation of a Roman winery that thrived on the site 2,000 years ago and whose remains were unearthed only 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>Not everyone can get to Beaucaire to visit Herve Durand's Roman winery and taste his recreated Roman wines, known as mulsum and turric ulae. But the next best thing might be a visit to the fascinating exhibition at the Jewish Museum called ''Drink and Be Merry: Wine and Beer in Ancient Times.''</p>
        <p>Through workaday farm tools, gloriously illustrated ceremonial vessels, paintings, sculpture and mosaics, the show traces the development of wine and beer -- mostly wine -- since the dawn of history to the rise of Islam in the seventh century.</p>
        <p>While the exhibition emphasizes the consumption of wine and beer and their place in ancient culture, there are exceptional depictions of how grapes were grown and how wine and beer were made. Most of the material is from Israel, where the exhibition was created and shown last year, supplemented by items from around the Middle East and from Greece and Rome.</p>
        <p>In spite of intense research, no one has been able to determine what grapes were grown in the ancient world or what kind of wines were made. From ancient texts it is known that there were many varieties of wine. As the handsome catalog accompanying the show notes, ''the Talmud refers to 60 types of wine, discussing them in terms of their quality, value and use.''</p>
        <p>What is known is that some, if not most, ancient wines were made from fermented raisins. This would mean wines with higher alcohol levels and increased sugar, which may be one reason the ancient records speak so often of mixing wine with water. (Such mixing is still commonplace where hot climates produce high-alcohol wines.)</p>
        <p>Pliny the Elder listed 80 wine types and grape varieties, two-thirds produced in Italy, while the historian and geographer Strabo, who lived in the first century B.C., concluded that there were perhaps 130 kinds of wine.</p>
        <p>There is evidence that grapes were cultivated as fruit -- not necessarily for wine -- in the Neolithic period. Agricultural archeologists know, too, that the vines that produced the best ancient wines were Vitis vinifera, the most important species for modern wine production. There are now -- and presumably were then -- thousands of varieties of Vitis vinifera.</p>
        <p>There were apparently many grades of wine. Excavations at Masada, the site of King Herod's fortress, turned up the Roman wine jugs called amphoras bearing the inscription ''For Herod of Judea.'' Evidently, Herod was partial to Italian wine. Some amphoras were inscribed, ''From the vineyards of Lucius Laenis,'' who may well have been the Robert Mondavi of his time.</p>
        <p>There must have been considerable spoiled wine, because the fermentation jugs on display show no efficient way of keeping air out during fermentation. That may explain why so much wine was flavored. Spices like myrrh were used; so were honey, balsam, pepper and wormwood.</p>
        <p>In Rome, new wine was actually a base from which various drinks could be made. As Mr. Durand put it: ''They added plaster to temper the wine's bitterness, clay to combat its softness, lime to deacidify it, saffron to color it and mushroom ashes to bleach red wine white. Among other things, they added roasted date pits, egg white and pork blood to wine -- even saltwater, to satisfy the Roman craving for salt.''</p>
        <p>Wooden barrels or casks were unknown until the third or second century B.C. In the ancient world, wine was fermented, stored and shipped in the amphora, an earthenware jug with a narrow neck, two vertical handles, wide shoulders and a pointed bottom that was inserted into a wooden base.</p>
        <p>Ranging from little more than a liter to well over 1,000 liters, amphoras were ubiquitous in the ancient world. Thousands have been found, mostly in shards but many intact. It is thought that thousands lie on the sea bottom, particularly the Mediterranean, in the holds of wine- and oil-carrying ships lost thousands of years ago.</p>
        <p>Probably because of the large number of exquisite objects it displays, the exhibition may seem to emphasize the ceremonial side of wine culture over the commercial. But it does devote considerable space to the ancient wine trade.</p>
        <p>One of the first vessels for shipping wine was the earthenware Canaanite jar. The exhibition includes one from the 14th or 13th century B.C., when the jars were common in the eastern Mediterranean, often carrying wine from Canaan to Egypt. When what is now Israel was under Ptolemaic rule, Canaan was Egypt's primary source of wine.</p>
        <p>The amounts of wine consumed in the ancient world can only be interpolated from other records, but they were not inconsequential. A Roman winery whose ruins were discovered in northern Spain is estimated to have produced 75,000 liters of wine a year. Attached to the reconstructed Roman winery at Beaucaire was a pottery that is estimated to have produced 3,000 to 4,000 amphoras a day. They would have had a capacity of almost Gallolike proportions.</p>
        <p>Wine enthusiasts of the (modern) world take note: ''Drink and Be Merry'' runs through Nov. 5 at the museum, Fifth Avenue and 92nd Street; admission is $8.</p>
