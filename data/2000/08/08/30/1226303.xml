        <p>IF West 13th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues were a jungle path, its sidewalks would be overgrown with vines. It doesn't seem to get much foot traffic, and as a consequence, Miyagi, a pretty little Japanese restaurant, seems overlooked. But if you can find your way to its small entryway, the reward is a restaurant of relaxed civility, with food that is tasty, reliable and sometimes exciting.</p>
        <p>Miyagi, which seats just 45 people in the small dining room and sushi bar, has the casual, welcoming air of an ideal neighborhood restaurant, with waitresses who are decorous despite jeans and T-shirts. The napkins and tablecloths are paper, the chopsticks are small and somewhat splintery, but Miyagi reserves elegance for what counts, like etched glass sake carafes that look like spherical pine cones and, of course, the freshest ingredients.</p>

        <p>IF West 13th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues were a jungle path, its sidewalks would be overgrown with vines. It doesn't seem to get much foot traffic, and as a consequence, Miyagi, a pretty little Japanese restaurant, seems overlooked. But if you can find your way to its small entryway, the reward is a restaurant of relaxed civility, with food that is tasty, reliable and sometimes exciting.</p>
        <p>Miyagi, which seats just 45 people in the small dining room and sushi bar, has the casual, welcoming air of an ideal neighborhood restaurant, with waitresses who are decorous despite jeans and T-shirts. The napkins and tablecloths are paper, the chopsticks are small and somewhat splintery, but Miyagi reserves elegance for what counts, like etched glass sake carafes that look like spherical pine cones and, of course, the freshest ingredients.</p>
        <p>The biggest thing about Miyagi is the menu, which has many familiar choices and just enough offbeat selections to keep things interesting. Consider what Yoshikatsu Makigi, the chef and owner, calls fried Alaska ($6): ground salmon, asparagus and mint wrapped in seaweed like a sushi roll and expertly deep-fried, then served in bite-size pieces with a miso dressing. It's a perfect melange of flavors and textures.</p>
        <p>The fried Alaska is one of the signature appetizers, which are only served at dinner and include other excellent choices like greens tossed with delicate soy milk skins in a mustard-and-miso dressing ($4.25). The dish is so bright and winning that only on closer examination can you tell that the greens are broccoli rape. I loved ankimo ($5.25), steamed monkfish liver, which is slightly briny but has all the soft delicacy of foie gras and is served with cucumber slivers in a rich ponzu sauce. Hijiki ($4), the mild black seaweed lightly sweetened with a little rice wine, and gomaae ($4.25), spinach with sesame sauce, are also good. But agedofu ($5.75), fried tofu, was unexpectedly tough.</p>
        <p>Miyagi's sushi and sashimi ($14 to $22) are just what you hope for in a midpriced restaurant: fresh and clean, with the cool distant flavor of the ocean. I especially liked the pinkish chutoro, tuna that is not quite as fatty as the luxurious otoro but suggests the soft richness of that far more expensive cut. Yellowtail is  buttery, while mackerel is as bracing as an ocean wind, and octopus and giant clam are appropriately chewy. The sushi combinations all come with a choice of miso soup or salad.</p>
        <p>Beyond the sushi horizon is another world of Japanese cooking. Negimaki ($15), broiled beef rolled with scallions and cut into bite-size pieces, is a savory meal, while tonkatsu ($12.50), a pork cutlet covered in fine bread crumbs, deep-fried and served with a fruity dipping sauce, is crisp and hearty. But my favorite dish is a simple broiled mackerel ($11.25), which is full of flavor and virtually melts in your mouth.</p>
        <p>Japanese restaurants are not known for their desserts, but Miyagi offers one unusual treat along with the standard red bean and green tea ice creams. Gelatinous rice dumplings ($3.50), which have more than a little bounce to them, are surrounded by a deliciously sweet paste of adzuki beans, which makes the whole dish worthwhile.</p>
