        <p>When investment bankers talk of the competition, they tend to base much of the comparison on one slice of the business: the highflying, much publicized world of mergers and acquisitions. If anything, the expected Credit Suisse acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette illustrates the importance placed on the multibillion-dollar industry of advising companies on whom they should take over or sell to next.</p>
        <p>The deal between Credit Suisse and Donaldson is expected to catapult the combined company into a serious force in the business of mergers and acquisitions, putting it in a league with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the top two firms and possibly edging out Merrill Lynch in the No. 3 spot of completed deals so far this year.</p>

        <p>When investment bankers talk of the competition, they tend to base much of the comparison on one slice of the business: the highflying, much publicized world of mergers and acquisitions. If anything, the expected Credit Suisse acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette illustrates the importance placed on the multibillion-dollar industry of advising companies on whom they should take over or sell to next.</p>
        <p>The deal between Credit Suisse and Donaldson is expected to catapult the combined company into a serious force in the business of mergers and acquisitions, putting it in a league with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the top two firms and possibly edging out Merrill Lynch in the No. 3 spot of completed deals so far this year.</p>
        <p>Most important, the acquisition bolsters Credit Suisse's mergers and acquisitions practice in crucial areas like the ultracompetitive and fast-growing telecommunications industry. Donaldson has advised on some of the largest telecommunications deals of late, working on the Deutsche Telekom acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless for about $50 billion and the France Telecom purchase of Orange for $37.5 billion.</p>
        <p>According to Thomson Financial Securities Data, Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment banking unit of Credit Suisse, ranked No. 4 in completed merger and acquisition deals worldwide for the first half of the year, doing 173 deals, which represent 21.2 percent of the advisory market. Donaldson ranked No. 14, doing 157 deals, for 6.5 percent of the market.</p>
        <p>Combining Donaldson's telecommunications advisory team with Credit Suisse First Boston's telecommunications and well-respected technology group should help the new firm raise even more business as both industries continue to converge, analysts said.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Credit Suisse First Boston lured Frank Quattrone away from Deutsche Bank to build its technology team, making it one of the best in country. Credit Suisse First Boston's technology team has advised on deals like the Terra Network acquisition of Lycos for $12.5 billion.</p>
