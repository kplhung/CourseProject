        <p>During a visit by Japan's foreign minister, Japan and China have affirmed their friendship, resolved to remain peaceful partners and scheduled a visit to Japan in October by Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji.</p>
        <p>Yet there have been unavoidable reminders of the tensions that always lurk in relations between these two Asian powers that are struggling to contain a strategic rivalry.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, President Jiang Zemin's trip to Japan was shadowed by China's continued bitterness over Japanese atrocities in World War II and Japanese resentment over demands for historical apologies.</p>
        <p>Now, two days into the four-day visit by Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, the Chinese have not pressed the historical point and, according to Japanese officials, have not even made their usual complaint about Japanese-American plans for regional missile defenses, which could be used against China in a battle for Taiwan.</p>
        <p>But the Japanese arrived with unusually blunt and public complaints, about what they see as ominous Chinese maritime incursions. They also warned that Japan's large-scale foreign aid to China -- $2.2 billion in 1998 -- could no longer be taken for granted given China's growing wealth and what Japan considers its aggressive behavior at sea.</p>
        <p>In late May and in July of this year, Chinese naval vessels cruised just outside Japan's 12-mile territorial limit apparently gathering intelligence, said the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yasuhisa Kawamura.</p>
        <p>The ship movements, while not a violation of maritime law, were inconsistent with friendly relations, Mr. Kawamura said, noting that in the first incident the vessels completely circled Japan's main islands.</p>
        <p>Of equal concern, 30 times last year and 17 times through Aug. 7 of this year, Chinese research vessels conducted operations, without the required permission, inside Japan's 200-mile exclusive economic zone.</p>
        <p>Some Japanese experts speculate that the ships are mapping the offshore sea bottom, data of great value to the military.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Foreign Minister Kono raised these concerns in a lengthy meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, telling him that Japanese ''feelings of distrust'' toward China are rising, the Japanese spokesman later reported.</p>
        <p>Regarding the naval vessels, Mr. Tang said the situation ''no longer exists,'' Mr. Kawamura told reporters. The Japanese interpret that as a promise that such cruises would be called off for now.</p>
        <p>As for the incursions by research vessels, both sides agreed to develop procedures to notify each other in advance of expeditions and to begin negotiations on disputes about maritime borders, which the Japanese called ''a step forward.''</p>
        <p>The Japanese have freely shared their concerns with foreign reporters here.</p>
        <p>In his meeting today, Mr. Kono told President Jiang that ''relations are in a good state but they are not problem-free,'' according to the Japanese spokesman.</p>
        <p>The Chinese appear determined to prevent any open rift with Japan, stressing the advantages of cooperation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kono has been greeted by a raft of top officials here including, diplomats noted, Zeng Qinghong, chief of the Communist Party's organization department, who has no formal position in foreign policy but is considered a powerful adviser to Mr. Jiang and a rising political star.</p>
        <p>Tonight, China's government-controlled media quoted Mr. Jiang as saying, ''I'm optimistic on the future of Chinese-Japanese relations.''</p>
