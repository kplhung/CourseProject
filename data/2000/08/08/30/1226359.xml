        <p>Laura Bush and Tipper Gore might want to pay a visit to the First Ladies' Hall at the Smithsonian Institution. In this exhibit, usually crowded with tourists, first ladies are known by their china and their clothes, not their resumes. The gowns of the nation's first five first ladies are even displayed on headless mannequins, symbolizing, perhaps, that heads are not really necessary in this role.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, Americans have not known quite what to do with the wives of presidents. Those who spoke their minds, like Mary Lincoln, Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Clinton, were vilified for meddling in the nation's business. Those who failed to assert themselves as individuals, like Mamie Eisenhower and Pat Nixon, were derided as female furniture.</p>
        <p>''I think I am more like a state prisoner than anything else,'' wrote our very first first lady, Martha Washington, in a letter of complaint to her niece.</p>
        <p>Now, before the next first lady arrives in the White House, we should reinvent the role. Does it still make sense to have a first lady who is not hired, elected or paid by anyone, but is treated like knockoff royalty and held to archaic standards of behavior?</p>
        <p>In their own marriages, some presidential wives may still prefer the traditional approach. If Mrs. Bush or Mrs. Gore wants to be a stay-at-home wife, fine. However, let's not expect her to do anything substantial about raising literacy levels or improving our mental health. And let us not have a first lady answer to any title that begins with ''co-'': co-partner, co-conspirator, co-president.</p>
        <p>Some feminists favor making the job a loosely defined full-time position. They reason that since first ladies are required to share the public stage, we owe them a salary. But that presumes that the woman who is first lady has something useful she wants to offer the country. She might be like Lou Hoover, who preferred the sidelines to the spotlight. ''My husband gives the speeches,'' Mrs. Hoover said, ''and I receive the roses.''</p>
        <p>And what if the first lady has a career interest of her own? We should know from observing Hillary Clinton that a woman who has her own fierce ambitions cannot easily give up her personality to a subservient role. That particular game of pretend is up.</p>
        <p>Three of the four wives of the men on the major party tickets this year have master's degrees: Laura Bush in library science, Tipper Gore in psychology and Hadassah Lieberman in American government and international relations. The fourth, Lynne Cheney, holds a Ph.D. in English. It is ludicrous to expect women like these to give up their own interests to serve solely as their husbands' adjuncts, even if we paid them.</p>
        <p>A better solution would be to abolish the title of first lady altogether and treat the wives of presidents as most wives are treated in this country. In other words, they could stay home and pursue their own interests or go out and get paying jobs of their own.</p>
        <p>American women today mix and match roles of their own choosing. A White House wife might easily be a mother, a highly paid professional in her own right and a wifely hostess when the occasion demanded it. For the sake of their dignity, it is time to stop letting the women in this position be defined by the gowned mannequins in the Smithsonian.</p>
