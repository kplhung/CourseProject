        <p>Rio Tinto P.L.C., the London-based mining concern, offered to buy out its minority partner Ashton Mining Ltd. for 612 million Australian dollars, or $350 million, in an attempt to keep its rival De Beers from gaining a foothold in one of the world's largest diamond mines. Rio Tinto's offer, including Ashton's 5-cent dividend, amounts to 1.90 Australian dollars a share, or 17 percent more than De Beers's bid of 1.62 dollars. Rio Tinto and De Beers are angling for Ashton's 38.2 percent stake in the Argyle Diamond Mine; Rio already owns 56.8 percent of the mine. Argyle, which specializes in selling more affordable diamonds, is one of only a handful of mines in the world that skirt De Beers's trading and marketing influence, and Rio Tinto has said that its independence has been crucial to the mine's success.</p>
