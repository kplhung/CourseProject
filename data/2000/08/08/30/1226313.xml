        <p>IN the race to unearth the world's least reclaimable dish, Roc may have scored an upset victory. Meatloaf has gained classic status. Macaroni and cheese can be found in fine Parisian restaurants. Mashed potatoes have been through so many conceptual contortions that they qualify as haute cuisine. It's getting harder to shock. But Roc has succeeded. ''Every Thursday we have spaghetti and meatballs,'' a waiter told me with a sly smile one evening. ''It's a Roc tradition.''</p>
        <p>You had to admire the cheek. For many Americans, this is a dish that comes in a can. And how, exactly, does a brand-new restaurant have a tradition?</p>
        <p>Still, if any restaurant could put the meatballs over, Roc is probably the place. It's a traditional Italian restaurant with a modern sense of style and some lunatic impulses that keep it interesting. It is also maddeningly inconsistent. At its best it delivers very fine food, with that Italian respect for ingredients and strong, clearly expressed flavors that can make simplicity seem like the only virtue worth having in the kitchen. There's an imagination at work, too. The desserts, in particular, roam adventurously beyond tiramisu and cheesecake territory (although both show up on the menu).</p>
        <p>But then you run into clunkers like the desiccated veal Milanese, a grim piece of meat pounded out to the size of a Ping-Pong paddle, or the appetizer of thin-sliced salmon, swordfish and white anchovies, so harshly marinated that the swordfish takes on the texture of shirt cardboard.</p>
        <p>Perseverance pays off, however. An appetizer special one night, eggplant Parmesan with breaded buffalo ricotta, sounded foolish and looked it, too: a sloppy slab of eggplant in thick sauce attended by two fat cheese balls. But the eggplant was firm to the bite, the tomato sauce was concentrated and intense, and those cheese balls, with a fine golden crust, were as light as whipped cream.</p>
        <p>Fried calamari showed the same light touch, coated in the thinnest possible fried batter, entirely oil-free, and surrounded by long tendrils of batter-fried zucchini that melted in the mouth. A pile of frisee lettuce topped with perfectly cooked shrimp and thin-sliced asparagus sounded plain but stood out as one of the most satisfying appetizers on the menu.</p>
        <p>Main courses waver. There are more than a few old-fashioned dishes done with no particular distinction, like veal scaloppine with mozzarella and prosciutto, or chicken with roasted pepper, herbs and sausage. The grilled rib-eye steak is large, and that's about all you can say about it. But the hefty lamb chop, encased in a crunchy potato crust fragrant with rosemary, stands out from the pack. Braised veal shank in a syrupy veal demi-glace, so tender it slid right off the bone, needed no more than a few slivers of olive to make a memorable main course. I never did penetrate the mysteries of one fish special, fillet of John Dory in a strange, Asian-influenced environment that included snow peas, green beans and squares of steamed pumpkin.</p>
        <p>The pasta is reliable, whether it's the rich, creamy oxtail ravioli with  butter and sage, the minimal taglierini with chunks of lobster, or a very robust special offered one night, linguine with nuggets of pancetta, sliced fava beans and scallions.</p>
        <p>It's worth listening to the specials, even though they tend to be numerous and contain twice as many ingredients as any of the other dishes, or so it seems when the waiters reel them off at top speed. In this time of labor shortages, Roc has managed to find that special breed of waiter who can take the order for a table of eight without putting pencil to pad or making eye contact with the diners.</p>
        <p>The performance becomes truly impressive on a busy night, as diners from the neighborhood drift in and pack the restaurant. The tables are placed close together. The tall ceilings turn clamor into din, and as parties come and go, you can see waiters rolling round table tops back and forth the length of the dining room, barely squeezing by the crowd at the bar. It looks like a sporting event with medieval roots, like the Palio.</p>
        <p>The waiter who takes your order may or may not reappear in a significant role. It doesn't matter. The food gets there, the wine makes its way to the table, and somehow order emerges out of chaos. The noise level and surging crowds make it tempting to cut and run before dessert. That would be a mistake. The list includes two winning chocolate desserts, a chocolate terrine, just slightly gooey, with espresso sauce and toasted almonds, and a chocolate almond cake, not too sweet, with a texture poised between fluffy and firm. A timely shipment of figs yielded a light cake split in half, filled with fig-mascarpone cream, and surrounded by a sticky pool of fig sauce and ripe plums. (The dessert has been reorganized around red currants, black currants and strawberries.)</p>
        <p>Roc is as breezy and offhand as its name, an allusion to Rocco Cadolini, who opened the restaurant with Elio Guaitolini of Elio's and other uptown neighborhood spots. Roc wanders heedlessly from one region of Italy to the other, and occasionally walks right off the map. The decor is idiosyncratic, with clean, elegant white walls and gauzy white curtains making a minimalist statement, only to be overruled by the peculiar ceramic knickknacks arranged on shelves around the dining room. It's a funny sort of place, but funny in the right way, with an eccentric side that's hard to resist.</p>
