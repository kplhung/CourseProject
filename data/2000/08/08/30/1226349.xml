        <p>The Supreme Court continued a ban today on the distribution of marijuana for medical purposes in California, signaling that it might consider the issue in its fall term.</p>
        <p>The court voted 7 to 1 to grant an emergency request from the Clinton administration to postpone enforcement of a lower court ruling that would have allowed the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative to distribute the drug.</p>
        <p>The decision today was the latest development in a clash between federal narcotics laws and a 1996 California voters' initiative to allow seriously ill patients to grow and use marijuana for pain relief, with doctors' approval. Similar initiatives have since been passed in several other states.</p>
        <p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, had ruled that medical necessity could be a defense to a federal criminal charge of distributing drugs. That ruling overturned an earlier one by Judge Charles R. Breyer of Federal District Court in San Francisco that barred distribution of marijuana.</p>
        <p>Justice Department lawyers had called the Ninth Circuit finding dangerous and said it would encourage drug traffickers and promote disrespect for the law.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court's decision to stay the Ninth Circuit ruling was not surprising; it would have been extraordinary for the highest court in the land not to let the government have its day before the tribunal. The court will decide whether to hear the case when it returns for its fall term.</p>
        <p>Only Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, contending that the government had failed to show that allowing ''seriously ill and dying patients'' to use marijuana would undermine the public interest.</p>
        <p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer disqualified himself because he is Judge Charles Breyer's brother.</p>
