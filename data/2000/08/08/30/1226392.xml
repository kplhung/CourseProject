        <p>President Clinton tried today to build Arab support for a Middle East peace in an hourlong meeting with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak.</p>
        <p>Next week, Mr. Clinton plans to continue the effort in separate meetings with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, and Prime Minister Enud Barak of Israel; Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak will be in New York for a United Nations meeting.</p>
        <p>During an early-morning refueling stop today on his return from a three-day trip to Africa, Mr. Clinton met with Mr. Mubarak and a retinue of aides at the Cairo airport. Mr. Clinton is eager to resolve the decades-long standoff in the five months left of his presidency, but officials say that in reality the end of September, just before Israeli elections, is the last opportunity to reconvene a gathering of Middle East leaders. Another deadline is the Sept. 13 date that the Palestinians have spoken of for declaring a state.</p>
        <p>''Time is short for resolving this,'' the president said as he stood at Mr. Mubarak's side at the airport. ''And I think all the parties understand that without the involvement and leadership and support of Egypt, they won't be able to do it.''</p>
        <p>When the Camp David talks collapsed last month without a deal, administration officials complained that Palestinians had been unwilling to compromise on key issues and that Arab leaders, including Mr. Mubarak, had not been active enough in building support for a pact.</p>
        <p>During those talks, Mr. Arafat insisted that East Jerusalem be the capital of a Palestinian state and rejected proposals for shared sovereignty over the sacred site known by Muslims as Haram al Sharif and by Jews as the Temple Mount.</p>
        <p>In Washington, a State Department spokesman who was asked about the prospects for a three-way meeting next week said he had no specific information. But the spokesman, Philip Reeker, insisted that the Camp David meeting ''produced significant progress on all of the core issues'' and said, ''If the parties are ready to make the tough decisions, we're ready to bring them together.''</p>
        <p>News agencies today quoted a senior Palestinian negotiator, Nabil Shaath, as saying Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak would meet for the first time since Camp David next week in New York. But Mr. Barak's office later denied that a meeting had been set, and Mr. Shaath also later distanced himself from such a session.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who leaves for South America on Wednesday morning after a brief return to Washington, is engaged in a barrage of diplomacy in the waning months of his term.</p>
        <p>During a day trip to Colombia, he will meet in Cartagena with President Andres Pastrana to show United States support for the government's counter-narcotics effort.</p>
        <p>On Monday, he was in Tanzania to witness the signing of an agreement by some of the parties involved in the vicious armed conflict between Hutus and Tutsis in Burundi.</p>
        <p>''If you let this moment slip away,'' Mr. Clinton told the parties in the Burundi dispute, ''it will dig the well of bitterness deeper and pile the mountain of grievances higher, so that someday, when somebody else has to come here and sit at a table like this, they will have an even harder job than you do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said he spoke from experience, having involved himself in the entrenched disagreements in Northern Ireland, the Balkans and the Middle East. Dennis B. Ross, the United States' senior Middle East negotiator, told reporters in Cairo that the latest round of diplomacy was aimed at preventing progress made during the Camp David talks from slipping away.</p>
