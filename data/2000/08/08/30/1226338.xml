        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I would add this to Kathryn Harrison's astute assessment of ''stepmotherhood'' (''Pity the Poor Stepmom,'' Op-Ed, Aug. 25): let's continue to move away from the fairy-tale portrayals of stepmothers and into reality.</p>
        <p>The role of a stepmother today is infinitely nuanced and demanding. Sometimes you are front and center in your stepchildren's lives, and  at other times, you are in the shadows.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I would add this to Kathryn Harrison's astute assessment of ''stepmotherhood'' (''Pity the Poor Stepmom,'' Op-Ed, Aug. 25): let's continue to move away from the fairy-tale portrayals of stepmothers and into reality.</p>
        <p>The role of a stepmother today is infinitely nuanced and demanding. Sometimes you are front and center in your stepchildren's lives, and  at other times, you are in the shadows.</p>
        <p>Most stepmothers I know struggle to do well by their stepchildren. We're juggling the needs of stepchildren, the wishes of biological parents and our own instincts.</p>
        <p>It is a day-by-day, sometimes hour-by-hour, undertaking, all balanced against the needs and wants of our own biological families.</p>
        <p>Since I became a stepmother to two boys, I've tried to keep their needs first in my mind and heart. That focus has helped me negotiate this difficult role. At the end of the day I can say this: I love them, and they love me. And that, to me, says a lot.</p>
