        <p>SINCLAIR AND FREDERIQUE PHILIP make an unlikely pair. She comes from Cannes, on the lush Cote d'Azur; he grew up on the spare Canadian plains. He likes fish; she likes meat. He is reserved, ironic and intellectual, an international economist by trade; she has an earth-motherly warmth.</p>
        <p>Yet, together they took a white clapboard house, built in 1928 on a lonely promontory on timber-clad Vancouver Island, facing the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Olympic Mountains of Washington State beyond it, and in 21 years turned the place into an enticing and idiosyncratic retreat for epicures.</p>
        <p>Today, Sooke Harbour House is one of Canada's half-dozen best restaurants, and it has a kitchen garden unlike any other in North America -- more than two acres of herbs, vegetables and edible flowers, many of them rarities, gradually devouring the lawns around the house, tumbling down to the sea, scaling hillsides in every direction, a living tapestry of leaf, shrub and color.</p>
        <p>Tuberous begonias with blossoms the size of dinner plates fill baskets and window boxes, and a few petals are plucked each day to flavor the mignonette sauce served with freshly opened local oysters. A climbing fig twines around a dining alcove and provides fruit in the fall. Aromatic lemon verbena and jaunty nasturtiums grow in profusion close to the house, adding a sweet scent and flashes of bright color to the many pleasures of Sooke. Herbal teas are made from verbena, and nasturtium blossoms enliven salads.</p>
        <p>Bergamot and borage flowers, two Philip favorites, will not soon supplant salt and pepper, but they and other products of the garden contribute not only subtle flavors but also an element of surprise to the menu, helping to accomplish the mission of serving only seasonal, organic food produced or harvested in British Columbia. People come here, Mr. Philip told me, ''for the Canadian experience,'' whether they come from Canada, the American Northwest or farther afield.</p>
        <p>So you will find no caviar and no mangoes at Sooke Harbour House, because none are produced in the province. But I'll wager you won't miss them -- not with line-caught sockeye salmon, trap-caught black cod and Dungeness crab fished out of the waters of Sooke Inlet; not with roast leg of suckling kid raised by a local farmer and lobster mushrooms and chanterelles foraged in the rain forest; not with West Coast mussels, plus marine exotica like gooseneck barnacles and limpets, all of them gathered by hand from rock-strewn beaches nearby.</p>
        <p>''No matter where I go,'' said Edward Tuson, the 36-year-old head chef, ''Nepal and India, Malaysia, Vancouver, I end up coming back here. I have total freedom, as long as I play by Sinclair's rules and keep it local. I invent something, fuss with it, change the menu every day. There's this fabulous garden, there's a network of farmers, and I have a fisherman who wakes me at 8, 8:30, every morning, calling to tell me what's best in the day's catch.''</p>
        <p>Close to 100 people eat here each night, in two big, alabaster-white dining rooms, one with a huge fireplace, both with big windows framing the vista of sea and sky. The rooms are decorated with the work of local artists, commissioned by Mrs. Philip (and with whimsical gifts from grateful diners: people send miniature hats -- straw for summer, wool for winter -- for the duck decoys on the mantlepiece).</p>
        <p>Candles burn in the chandeliers. The window in one door is shaped like a crab. Like the whole place, the dining rooms are casual, unpretentious, very much in harmony with the rugged surroundings, but totally professional.</p>
        <p>Self-taught the key players may be, but this is no amateur hour.</p>
        <p>MR. AND MRS. PHILIP met in 1967 at a party in Nice given by a friend of hers. He had just arrived from Canada, to work on his French before heading to Africa. He never got there. They lived in Aix-en-Provence for a while, then at Grenoble, where he studied economics, and then in Toronto. On a business trip, he came upon Sooke Harbour House and decided to buy it.</p>
        <p>For 16 years, the Philips lived in the basement with their children and worked upstairs. Making the place go took a kind of manic concentration and energy, and three years ago, just when they had almost paid off the mortgage, but not quite, they took out a new, bigger one to expand the inn to 28 bedrooms. He is now 53, she 52, and the staff, all recruited locally, has grown from three to 80.</p>
        <p>''Sinclair,'' Mrs. Philip said, ''does his research on anything the same way as he did the research for his Ph.D. at Grenoble, so when he decided to start the garden, he read everything in print on herbs and edible flowers.''</p>
        <p>Many of the choicest things Mr. Philip grows were brought here, in the form of seed or seedlings from commercial nurseries. That is the case with the tiny, seductively perfumed woodland strawberries the French call fraises des bois, as well as the Mabel Grey geraniums from South Africa, whose leaves have a lemon-lime scent -- a little like Sprite.</p>
        <p>But he has learned a lot from the Northwest Indian tribes that have lived on Vancouver Island since time immemorial and from people who study them, like Nancy Turner, an ethnobotanist at the University of British Columbia. They taught him about cooking with the tender young needles of the fir tree and about many of the sea creatures that live on the beaches and in the tidal pools. One of the inn's most talented foragers is Carol Planes, an Indian, who regularly clambers down slippery rocks to gather shellfish.</p>
        <p>''These people have been eating this stuff forever,'' Mr. Philip said. ''You listen to them, and you learn.''</p>
        <p>Early clients blanched at things they were offered to eat. Mr. Philip remembers people asking, ''How can you eat those bitter greens?'' Mrs. Philip was often asked to taste a dish first, in a customer's presence, to demonstrate that it was actually edible.</p>
        <p>You still see perplexed looks on people's faces when they sit down to their first meal and read a menu entry like this one: ''Gooseneck barnacle terrine with grand fir and calendula petal emulsion, bull kelp pickle and sea cucumber.'' But they soon learn that weird as it may sound, it tastes like the very essence of the sea. It tastes like Japan. It tastes very good.</p>
        <p>With it and the other inventive dishes on the menu come wines from a 91-page list -- wines from France and Australia and Italy, Germany and California and Oregon, including runs of older vintages of Stag's Leap Cask 23 and Silver Oak cabernet sauvignons; Grange shiraz from South Australia and choice, scarce Leonettis from Washington. On top of that, there are intriguing wines from Vancouver Island itself, as well as the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia's premier viticultural area.</p>
        <p>But the magic of Sooke Harbour House lies in more than its table and its cellar. The setting is remarkable, with fog and mist swirling in from the sea, sometimes lying like a duvet on the harbor. Clearing and clouding over several times a day, the sky first reveals and then obscures the mountains, like some cosmic theatrical curtain rising and falling. And all the while, sea lions and orca whales frolic offshore while ospreys and loons circle overhead.</p>
        <p>The rooms, each different, each decorated with Indian and other local art, are the spacious balcony seats for this spectacle. Most have fireplaces and refrigerators; each gets its ration of two big sugar cookies every day.</p>
        <p>It is the kind of place that defies a person to get or stay uptight. I went planning to catch up on some reading and writing, but I failed.</p>
        <p>One of the Philip daughters, Nishka, 19, gave me a running commentary one morning when I tagged along behind her as she gathered flower petals.</p>
        <p>''This,'' she said, pointing to some chivelike stems topped with purple flowers, ''is called 'society' garlic, because it's not supposed to get on your breath or anything. But I have my doubts, eh? These orange flowers you see everywhere are pot marigolds, or calendulas. They bloom all year, throughout the calendar, which is where they get their name. The breakfast people put them in cheese biscuits, to make the biscuits taste twice as cheesy. Long ago, they were used to color Cheddar.''</p>
        <p>Who would guess where flavors lurk in the garden? Day lily flowers go into sorbet, carnation petals are added to salads, and sweet woodruff, an herb with a perky white flower, long used by Central Europeans in wine punches, is used at Sooke in ice cream.</p>
        <p>No culinary use has been found yet for the passionflower vine that grows along the eaves on one side of the house. It is a pet of Nishka's, not only because of its pretty, complex purple-blue flowers, but also because it spreads so exuberantly. ''You can hear it growing,'' she assured me with a grin.</p>
        <p>A little farther along, Nishka stopped at two groups of plants, side by side, which looked identical to me. To her, too, as it turned out. A book I found later in the house identified one as Korean mint (Agastache rugosa), which smells like root beer, and the other, a cousin, as anise hyssop (Agastache foeniculum), which has a slight licorice flavor. That night, my wife, Betsey, and I had a sauce subtly flavored with anise hyssop, among other things, on a piece of black cod. Another night, a small packet of black cod arrived in a crab and corn broth, flavored with shingeku, or chrysanthemum leaves.</p>
        <p>In both dishes, it was the fresh, sweet taste and the firm, slightly springy texture of the fish that hit you at first bite. Only slowly did the herbal flavors assert themselves, adding an unanticipated contrast.</p>
        <p>A gray, gawky cardoon plant grew into a tree near a cluster of borage plants -- ''borage for the bees,'' Nishka said, ''they love it.'' So do Englishmen, I told her; they put whole stalks of the stuff into the Pimms' Cup they like to drink at Wimbledon or after a cricket match. Across the way, she pointed to a hedge of hops, grown not for beer but for the delicate young spring shoots, which the Belgians (and also the Philips) cook like asparagus.</p>
        <p>In a shady spot at the foot of the hedge some fernlike sweet cicely was doing nicely. Some of it was destined for a mild sabayon, also flavored with ginger and white peaches, which Mr. Tuson served us on superbly briny sea urchin roe he had taken from the shell a mere five minutes before we ate it.</p>
        <p>Byron Cook, head gardener for 13 years, grows all sorts of salad crops, including shiso, the hauntingly flavored Japanese leaf, and arugula and red romaine and Red Sails lettuce. Most of them are planted in raised beds, so the soil can more easily be renewed with compost, as successive crops are harvested.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook's is more or less a year-round operation. It seldom snows at Sooke, which lies in hardiness Zone 8, the same as Charleston, S.C., a beneficiary of benign Pacific breezes and currents. A few of the tenderer plants, like verbena, are lifted from the soil and kept inside for the brief winter, and cuttings are taken of others to start fresh plants when spring arrives.</p>
        <p>But all of the lettuces, the pansies, the English daisies and the hardier herbs (like an 11-foot rosemary bush outside one of the guest rooms) keep right on chugging, year-round.</p>
        <p>Not everything flourishes at Sooke. It took Mr. Cook a half-dozen tries to establish Mexican marigolds, which have a flavor similar to tarragon, and even in this cosseted corner of the Pacific, dill gets scraggly and sun-hungry basil doesn't grow very tall. Reassuring, I guess, for us brown-thumbs.</p>
        <p>SWEET LAVENDER, MAPLE SYRUP AND CARROT ICE MILK  Adapted from Sooke Harbour House  Time: 1 hour 40 minutes, plus freezing time</p>
        <p>For the carrot puree:  2 pounds organic carrots, trimmed and peeled  1 tablespoon fresh organic rosemary or 2 tablespoons dried  1 cup unfiltered organic apple juice  2 tablespoons brown sugar</p>
        <p>For the ice milk:  2 cups 2 percent milk  1 1/2 teaspoons fresh or dried organic lavender flowers or a 2-inch cinnamon stick  8 large egg yolks</p>
        <p>1/2 cup maple syrup</p>
        <p>1/4 cup granulated sugar</p>
        <p>1/4 cup brown sugar  1 ounce brandy, Cognac, rye or rum.</p>
        <p>1. To prepare carrot puree, combine carrots, rosemary, apple juice and brown sugar in a medium nonreactive saucepan. Place over high heat until simmering, then cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until carrots are soft, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool.</p>
        <p>2. In a food processor, puree the carrots with any remaining juice. Process until the puree is very smooth, about 4 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. To prepare ice milk, combine carrot puree, milk and lavender in a medium saucepan. Place mixture over medium heat until it just reaches a simmer. Remove from heat, and keep warm.</p>
        <p>4. In a medium nonreactive bowl, combine egg yolks, maple syrup, granulated sugar and brown sugar. Heat mixture over a double boiler, whisking until it is thick and light in color, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and place a strainer over mixture. Pour in carrot puree, stirring and pressing with a rubber spatula until puree passes through into egg mixture.</p>
        <p>5. Return double boiler to heat. Whisk until mixture is steaming and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and whisk occasionally as it cools. (If mixture begins to curdle, pour into a blender and process until smooth.)</p>
        <p>6. When mixture has cooled, stir in brandy. Freeze in an ice-cream maker, according to manufacturer's instructions.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 1/2 quarts (about 6 servings).</p>
