        <p>Vying Voices  After competitions in Paris, Mexico City, Madrid, Bordeaux, Tokyo, Hamburg and San Juan, Placido Domingo's ''Operalia,'' a world opera contest, comes this year to Los Angeles for the first time. It begins tomorrow, offering $175,000 in prizes and its Alberto Vilar Award (named for its principal sponsor) to six winners selected by a jury of which Mr. Domingo will be the chairman. In Royce Hall at U.C.L.A. 40 singers will compete for three days in the preliminary rounds; semifinals for 20 contestants will be held on Sunday; and at 7 on Tuesday night, to the accompaniment of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, led by Mr. Domingo, each of the 10 finalists will sing one aria. Prizes will be awarded afterward. On Wednesday, ushering in his first season as the artistic director of the Los Angeles Opera, Mr. Domingo will conduct the opening of Verdi's ''Aida.''</p>
        <p>Venetian Screenings  The 57th Venice International Film Festival, featuring a tribute for lifetime achievement to Clint Eastwood, who graduated from Italian spaghetti westerns to Hollywood stardom and an Oscar-winning career as a director, begins today with a screening of his latest film, ''Space Cowboys.'' Nineteen films are in competition for the Golden Lion award. Other American filmmakers whose works will be seen in or out of competition at the festival, which ends on Sept. 9, are Robert Altman, Ed Harris, Martin Scorsese and Julian Schnabel.</p>
        <p>Inner Worlds  The realm where reason yields to imagination, where the mysterious, satirical, demonic, hallucinatory impulses of the human mind hold sway, has long beckoned to artists. There, in the late 1790's, Goya found the inspiration for his series of etchings ''Los Caprichos'' (''The Caprices''). European and American artists like Delacroix, Chagall, Klee, Tchelitchew and Miro followed in his path. In a new show at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the life of the mind is evoked in works on paper. Sharing mystery, otherworldliness, imaginativeness, the works in ''When Reason Dreams: Drawings Inspired by the Visionary, the Fantastic and the Unreal'' remain on view through Oct. 29.</p>
        <p>Season's Greeters  Adding ''Sounds of Praise,'' a new Sunday series featuring gospel music, the Brooklyn Academy of Music's BAMcafe Live fall season will begin on Sept. 7 at 9 p.m. The opening attraction is the griot Sekou Sundiata, whose poem-songs resonate with bebop, Afro-pop and hip-hop. BAMcafe Live's eclectic menu of spoken word and music includes attractions like the musical explorer Sam Newsome's Global Unity, which fuses jazz rhythms with world-music rhythms, and a tribute to John Coltrane by its resident big band, the Next Legacy Orchestra.</p>
