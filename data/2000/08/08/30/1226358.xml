        <p>Graduate School of Management at Simmons College in Boston, which was established as an all-woman program in 1974 in order to ensure students a classroom environment free from male dominance, now sees its goal as grooming women for advanced leadership roles as chief executives; new focus means not teaching women how to mimic men, or even women, but to be individuals with their own leadership qualities; Simmons program is still the only all-woman business management program, and its enrollment is growing even while other business schools, now far more hospitable to women, struggle for applicants; photo; graph (M)</p>

        <p>They were pioneers, those first women to set foot in a business school. They struggled to be taken seriously in classes and rarely read a positive word about businesswomen in their studies. Then two Harvard Business School professors, fed up with a male culture they thought antagonized female students, as well as female academics like themselves, had a radical idea: a business school just for women.</p>
        <p>In 1974, with $37,000 in grants and two typing rooms borrowed from a women's college, they created a school with a feminist bent, where women were guaranteed to dominate every class discussion.</p>
        <p>A quarter-century later, the Graduate School of Management at Simmons College is still the only all-woman M.B.A. program in the world, but how the world has changed. Other business schools have thrown open their doors to women, even actively recruited them. Women now make up 30 percent of business school classes, according to the Education Department, up from 6 percent then, and hold about half the middle-management positions, up from 5 percent.</p>
        <p>Mission accomplished, in a way that would seem to make Simmons obsolete. Yet this small, unaccredited program has increased its class size 25 percent since 1995 while more prominent business schools are struggling for applicants. Why do they come? For the same things they seek in a workplace: supportive colleagues, flexible scheduling and, they say, a chance to be themselves.</p>
        <p>Take the babies. ''I wanted mine to coincide with graduation,'' said April Steele, 32, one of seven pregnant women in her strategy and leadership class this year. Their fellow students gave them no second looks as they eased themselves into the auditorium chairs, unless they were looks of sympathy. At one class, a discussion on financial structuring even sidetracked to obstetricians and massage therapy.</p>
        <p>Would a classroom of men tolerate such talk? Not likely, Ms. Steele believes. ''A guy would say, 'Let's just move on,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>Not that Simmons prides itself on coddling students. Classes follow the  case-study method pioneered by the Harvard Business School. But more of the cases feature women as decision-makers, and most are taught by female professors. During a three-hour class last semester, Professor Mary Louise Hatten discussed Rina Spence, a generally successful Boston entrepreneur whose career nadir was opening a series of alternative health clinics for women that ultimately failed. The students picked apart Ms. Spence's business plan, pointing out what they would have done differently.</p>
        <p>Not all the cases feature wonder women, but studying executives of all kinds gives students a ''mental Rolodex of role models,'' Ms. Hatten said.</p>
        <p>More than gender separates her students from the majority of M.B.A. candidates. Their average age is 32, three years older than the typical business school graduate. They have an average of eight years work experience. The majority attend part-time, and many are jumping from jobs as teachers or nurses into business. Classes are so flexible that a student can flip between day and night classes and take up to five years to complete a degree.</p>
        <p>Many of them would not have gone to business school at all were it not for Simmons, they say. Nontraditional students, like women who did not finish college because of family obligations, are welcome. (That, in part, is why the school remains unaccredited.) Half of the applicants over 34 applied only to Simmons.</p>
        <p>Ms. Steele was all but dragged into Simmons by one of her bosses, a Simmons graduate. ''She gave me the kick I needed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the loyal network of alumnae is arguably one of the most active among business schools. Graduates encourage others, from 20-somethings to established career women, to try it, providing the school with a steady stream of applicants.</p>
        <p>Lisa Guscott was one. She was secure in her job as a project manager with her family's real estate company and had not given much thought to a business degree until a high-ranking bank executive from the class of 1978 talked her ear off about the program.</p>
        <p>''It was something that I didn't have to do,'' said Ms. Guscott, with the air of someone who knows her business. But she saw so many Simmons graduates around town, she said, that she asked herself why not?</p>
        <p>While about 20 percent of the students are from abroad, the majority are locals who wind up in Boston-area companies. Last year, BankBoston, which has since merged with Fleet, had more than 50 Simmons graduates as executives.</p>
        <p>''The joke around town is, 'Oh, here comes another Simmons grad,' '' said Gail Deegan, class of 1978, and currently the chief financial officer at Houghton Mifflin.</p>
        <p>When Anne Jardim and Margaret Hennig founded the school, their focus was simple enough: to teach women how to get along in a man's business world and how to cope with the so-called glass ceiling that held them back.</p>
        <p>''In the beginning, the sense was teaching women the rules of the game,'' said Joyce K. Fletcher, a Simmons professor. ''Women hadn't been socialized to really understand how businesses were run. A lot was around giving women the skills they needed just to get in the door, just to be seen as legitimate.''</p>
        <p>By all accounts, Ms. Jardim and Ms. Hennig ran the school with the devotion and verve of entrepreneurs. The two scholars, who wrote the influential 1976 book, ''The Managerial Woman,'' saw Simmons as a way to promote their thesis that men and women have distinct management styles, with women more attuned to collaborative work. Today, the description for the management and behavior course still promises students a lesson in ''the dominance of male norms'' and ''the dismissal of female values'' in the workplace.</p>
        <p>But with so many women having broken through the barriers that once held them back, Simmons administrators have a new goal: to groom women for advanced leadership roles as chief executives. That will not happen by teaching women simply to mimic men in the boardroom, Ms. Fletcher says. ''We've been reading those books for 30 years,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Instead, she suggests, aspiring women executives should act not like men, or even women, but individuals with their own leadership qualities. Patricia O'Brien, dean of the school, calls it ''finding their voice.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Guscott, who graduated in August, all but rolls her eyes when asked whether her same-sex classes had prepared her for the male-dominated ''real world'' of business. She has plenty of interaction with stubborn men, thank you, she replies: her business partners are her father and two uncles, all over 70. She is here to learn, seriously.</p>
        <p>''I plan to take our business to different levels,'' she said. ''I want to get rid of the mom-and-pop way of doing business.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most remarkable accomplishment of Simmons is its ability to survive as its original purpose loses relevance. Laura D' Andrea Tyson, dean of the Walter A. Haas School of Business of the University of California at Berkeley and the first woman to lead a major business school, said classroom equality has not even been an issue in the two years of her tenure. ''It's certainly true that the social conditions of the 1970's are not the social conditions of today,'' Ms. Tyson said. ''The opportunities for women have gotten better, and that's great.''</p>
        <p>The Harvard Business School, meantime, is trying to improve its image as an old-boys bastion, introducing more than 60 new case studies that feature women the last two years.</p>
        <p>Yet while women now make up 30 percent of classes at top-tier business schools, that proportion has not budged in a decade. Many women retain a distrust of business, according to a study released in May by Catalyst, a New York research group that tracks women in business, in part because they see so few role models in the corporate world and in part because they view it as incompatible with striking a balance between work and family.</p>
        <p>Simmons preaches that it is possible to strike that balance -- and its evangelists spread the word at its annual Women's Leadership Conference. This year, about 2,000 women convened for a day of speeches by women like Queen Noor of Jordan, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan and the ''Today Show'' co-host Katie Couric.</p>
        <p>Ms. Deegan, who helped organize the first leadership conference more than 20 years ago, is still amazed. ''When we started,'' she said, ''We wondered if we would get 40 women to attend.''</p>
        <p>When Ms. Couric spoke at the conference, her face beaming down from projection television screens, she got raucous applause for a one-liner that said as much as any position paper about how far women have come in the business world. ''I love the smell of estrogen in the morning,'' she quipped.</p>
