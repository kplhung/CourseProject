        <p>Al Leiter pitched and Moises Alou swung and a foul ball came next. It happened nine times in one at-bat in the third inning last night -- on sliders and curveballs and fastballs to all spots -- and if it was painful for a Mets fan to watch, imagine how Leiter felt.</p>
        <p>The Mets left-hander was already in pain, with a strained muscle in his backside. Alou eventually delivered a run-scoring single that continued a torturous four-run inning that kicked off the Houston Astros' 11-1 victory. Leiter is not expected to miss his next start, but he left after that third inning, his shortest start of the year.</p>
        <p>Right fielder Derek Bell also left the game with an injury, departing in the eighth after he banged his left knee against the padded wall down the right-field line in pursuit of a foul fly. Bell suffered a bruise and X-rays were negative; he said he will see how he feels today but may need a day off.</p>
        <p>The only remaining drama after the Astros built their 4-0 lead was whether the Atlanta Braves would lose and thus preserve the Mets' tie for first place in the National League East. The Braves did lose, 4-2, to Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>About halfway through his bullpen session, Leiter felt the muscle strain. He cut short the session and believed he could make it through the game -- ''improvise, smoke and mirrors,'' he said. He was able to make good pitches, which was what made the Alou at-bat so frustrating, he said. But the pain forced Leiter to land softly, toward the first-base side, and that altered his mechanics enough that his curveball was ''swoopy, as opposed to straight down.''</p>
        <p>''It was just enough to aggravate it to where I didn't feel I could have my normal delivery,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Leiter lost to Houston for the second time this month, his record dropping to 14-6. Wade Miller, the Astros' rookie right-hander, pitched a complete-game five-hitter, improving to 3-5.</p>
        <p>The game was marred by sloppy play; the Mets made three errors, including one by Lenny Harris, whose shaky fielding at third base earned mock cheers from fans who had little else to make noise about. The fans must have held Harris partly responsible for the Astros' third. After Roger Cedeno walked with one out, Julio Lugo smacked a liner toward Harris, who was starting for Robin Ventura, who has struggled lately and had the night off even though Houston started a right-hander.</p>
        <p>Ventura has been fine defensively, though there's no telling if he would have caught Lugo's line drive. In any case, it deflected off Harris's glove and rolled into foul territory, good for a double. Jeff Bagwell came up next and bounced a single up the middle, putting the Astros ahead, 2-0.</p>
        <p>Richard Hidalgo walked, putting runners at first and second, and Alou's killer at-bat came next. The Astros' right fielder saw 11 pitches and did not swing and miss at any. He fouled off the first four pitches, then took a pitch as Bagwell stole third. Alou fouled off five more pitches before bouncing a ball through the middle for a run-scoring single.</p>
        <p>Leiter looked at Alou, a former teammate, and Alou just shrugged. ''It would have been a fun at-bat in a different situation,'' Leiter said.</p>
        <p>The pitching coach Dave Wallace came to the mound, and Leiter stayed in to strike out Tony Eusebio. But Chris Truby singled in a run, and Tim Bogar tapped a ball toward third. Harris's throw was too late to catch Bogar.</p>
        <p>The fourth run scored, and after Leiter got Miller to ground to Harris, his night was over. Pat Mahomes batted for Leiter after two singles opened the Mets' third. Mahomes popped up his bunt attempt and the Mets didn't score.</p>
        <p>Mahomes's night was just as rocky when he took the mound. He allowed five runs in three innings in his first appearance after a disastrous start in San Diego last Tuesday. Mahomes has allowed runs in eight consecutive outings, and his earned run average is a season-high 5.62. He has experimented with everything from new deliveries to the height of his socks, he said, but nothing is curing his wildness. Mahomes has 14 walks in his last 162/3  innings.</p>
        <p>''When the team's going good, you want to be going good with them,'' Mahomes said. ''I've personally taken us out of two games that we possibly could have won. I expect to go out and do my job every time I get the ball, and I haven't been able to do it like I did it last year.''</p>
        <p>Mahomes was lifted after three innings, giving way to Jerrod Riggan in the seventh. The 26-year-old right-hander, just up from Class AA Binghamton, retired the side in the seventh and allowed two unearned runs in the eighth, the inning in which Bell hurt his knee. Doctors told Bell the knee will be stiff today.</p>
        <p>''If it's real, real sore, I'll let them know and I'll back off,'' Bell said. ''We're going to see how I feel when I wake up and then come back strong.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The reliever JOHN FRANCO threw on flat ground again yesterday, deciding to wait at least one more day before throwing off a bullpen mound. Franco has soreness in his left pectoral muscle and wants to wait until the pain is gone before extending himself further. General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS said he did not believe the left-handed pitcher BILLY TRABER, the Mets' first-round draft pick, attended classes yesterday at Loyola Marymount University, meaning the Mets can continue to negotiate. Phillips, however, is unlikely to budge from his current offer of less than $1 million because of concerns about Traber's elbow. ADAM KATZ, an agent advising Traber, said he was still having discussions with the Mets.</p>
        <p>The Mets gave themselves further flexibility for the postseason by adding the Class A infielder LEANDRO ARIAS to the 40-man roster and placing him on the disabled list. With shortstop REY ORDONEZ also on the disabled list, the Mets have two post-season roster spots they can give to position players who were not with the team before Aug. 31. While Ordonez has said he might return from his broken left forearm injury in September, Phillips said that was ''unrealistic'' because Ordonez can not begin throwing or swinging until Oct. 1. JEFF BAGWELL's two-run single in the third gave him 33 runs batted in this month. That broke a Houston record Bagwell shared with the Mets' DEREK BELL, who drove in 31 runs in July 1995.</p>
