        <p>When electronic fingerprinting was introduced five years ago, it caught the imagination of politicians who saw it as the ultimate high-tech weapon to fight welfare fraud.</p>
        <p>New York was among the first states to try the new technology, and as it proclaimed success against welfare cheats, other states followed. Now New York is extending its requirement for the electronic fingerprinting of welfare recipients to people applying for Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Yet there is little evidence that so-called finger imaging -- intended to deter would-be double-dippers using fake identity papers --  has had any significant impact in preventing fraud. In fact, a study by the state three years ago found that other welfare changes had made finger imaging largely superfluous from the outset. But the state has refused to make that $658,000 study public, and now calls it outdated and flawed.</p>
        <p>''We think the finger imaging program is an effective method of fraud deterrence,'' said Robert Doar, executive deputy commissioner for the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, ''and along with a whole other range of things related to welfare reform, has contributed to making the welfare program in New York significantly more credible.''</p>
        <p>But last week, Paul J. Sticha, an expert who recently reviewed such programs nationally for the federal government, said the study was highly relevant. In an experiment using control groups, finger imaging made no difference in the dropout or approval rates of welfare recipients, regardless of whether they were told in advance that their fingerprints would be checked.</p>
        <p>Had the report been made public, Mr. Sticha said, other states that adopted such programs might have reconsidered.</p>
        <p>The New York expansion of finger imaging into Medicaid comes as the biometric identification industry -- which uses computers to recognize personal physical characteristics -- is lobbying hard around the country to bridge the gap between public acceptance of such systems to curb welfare fraud, and public resistance to more general applications, like requiring fingerprint images for cashing a check, getting a driver's license or filling a prescription.</p>
        <p>Besides New York, seven states -- California, Connecticut, New Jersey, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts and Illinois -- use such systems for some or all welfare recipients, and eight more are considering them.</p>
        <p>But most of those states have rejected finger imaging for Medicaid patients, since their own health officials say it would do little to curb Medicaid fraud, which is committed mainly by doctors. The officials also say it could work against the bipartisan goal of encouraging enrollment by the uninsured.</p>
        <p>''Those of us who are concerned about fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program recognize that the major problems are not in beneficiary enrollment, but rather, durable medical equipment that isn't delivered, or home health services that don't show up,'' said Timothy M. Westmoreland, chief Medicaid official for the federal government. ''I would be concerned about any policy that had the effect of steering eligible people away from Medicaid.''</p>
        <p>A federal official said the Health Care Financing Administration would investigate whether a finger imaging requirement was legal for Medicaid, adding, ''Some verification is appropriate, and other activities that suggest verification are intimidation of eligible people.''</p>
        <p>New York is now expanding its $40 million contract with a French defense contractor to require the finger imaging of about 440,000 adults who qualify for Medicaid. (Most of the 2.7 million Medicaid patients in New York would be exempted.)</p>
        <p>John Signor, a spokesman for the state's Department of Health, said the move would save money by ''precluding people from accessing health benefits in different locations under multiple identities,'' and might be especially useful against illegal prescription drug sales.</p>
        <p>The program will use the finger imaging equipment and computer system already being used to screen food stamp and cash recipients at welfare offices, and the state will pay extra fees to cover fingerprints from Medicaid applicants. State records show that officials are seeking approval to pay $9.9 million more to a Tacoma, Wash., subsidiary of the French contractor, Sagem Morpho Inc., and to extend its contract another year to June 2, 2002.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doar credited finger imaging with the dropping of more than 38,223 people from public aid since it began in 1995 at a savings of $297 million, most of it in the first two years.</p>
        <p>But a different picture is conveyed in the state's report, ''Automated Finger Imaging System Comprehensive Evaluation,'' which was submitted in 1997 by the research consultants Macro International and Maximus Inc., and accepted in 1998.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sticha, who reviewed a copy of the 120-page final report obtained by The New York Times, said the most scientifically compelling part was the controlled experiment that tracked groups of recipients told to report for recertification at welfare centers in the Bronx and two upstate counties, Monroe and Niagara.</p>
        <p>''The experiment found no difference between the treatment and control groups, or the differences seem to be just as likely to be in one direction as the other,'' Mr. Sticha said. ''The picture from the experiment is zero.''</p>
        <p>Other parts of the study that examined overall caseload trends were more difficult to interpret, he added.  Researchers tried to give the state the benefit of the doubt, Mr. Sticha said, in calculating $40 million in annual savings from an estimate that the caseload was 3.7 percent lower than had been predicted, even though that figure fell within the 5 percent margin of error.</p>
        <p>The study found it statistically impossible to calculate how many people stayed away because of finger imaging, rather than because of all the other reasons caseloads were already declining sharply, including a rebounding economy, tough work requirements, anti-fraud home inspections and shortened eligibility.</p>
        <p>In a 1999 report for the Agriculture Department on biometric systems nationwide, Mr. Sticha estimated that finger imaging resulted in a 1.3 percent decline in the welfare rolls due to both reduced fraud and the deterrence of eligible people for reasons like embarrassment or fear.  But he now says that had he seen the New York study, ''I would have revised that estimate downward.''</p>
        <p>In interviews, officials in New Jersey, Texas and Connecticut stressed the role of finger imaging as a kind of burglar alarm that restores public confidence in the welfare system's integrity. But they have quietly scaled back claims of huge savings trumpeted in early accounts about pilot projects that cut thousands of people off welfare after they failed to show up for finger imaging.</p>
        <p>It later turned out many recipients had not received the notices, did not understand them or could not come in before officials cut them off from legitimate benefits they needed, said Michael Mahoney, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Human Services. After weeks or months, many were able to reopen their cases.</p>
        <p>In New York City, for example, of 11,021 people on home relief who were cut off in 1995 in the first finger-imaging call-up, only 4,242 were still off the rolls by August 1996.</p>
        <p>Moreover, officials and researchers agree, no program can distinguish between those who shun finger imaging for fear of being caught in fraud, and those who stay away because of libertarian beliefs or privacy concerns.</p>
        <p>Since 1995, at least 15 state legislatures have quashed biometric measures affecting nonwelfare citizens, and a few, including Michigan and Virginia, have passed laws banning or restricting their use.</p>
        <p>Citing privacy concerns, New Jersey lawmakers rejected a proposal by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman last year to issue ''smart cards'' that would store medical, credit and driving records on a single ID card. The state is nevertheless expanding finger imaging to welfare applicants statewide, from a four-year pilot project in and around Newark.</p>
        <p>The pilot program, which officials say has never been evaluated, was started after interstate comparisons of Social Security numbers and names yielded 1,500 matches with New York welfare recipients. But long after the headlines faded, it turned out that all but 60 of those matches were mistakes or for people who had legitimately moved.</p>
        <p>Last year the Arizona Legislature ordered state administrators to find a way to extend finger imaging to  Medicaid, and to include equipment to check fingerprints at pharmacies. But the administrators protested.</p>
        <p>''It didn't make much sense to us,'' said Jerry Hancock, director of the finger imaging program for Arizona.</p>
        <p>A Medicaid patient cannot get more health care by posing as two people, he noted. He said health and social services officials had told legislators that the program was unlikely to be economical, and the harm to those cut off even temporarily from timely care could be expensive.</p>
        <p>But biometrics expansion seems to have a life of its own, Mr. Hancock said. ''All these large companies are out there at every legislature in the United States and they're pushing and pushing and pushing for their programs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>New York's use of finger imaging for Medicaid patients, authorized by its 1997 welfare law, will not affect groups whose care accounts for three-quarters of the Medicaid budget: nursing home residents, home health care recipients, people in institutions and people who apply for Medicaid in a hospital or clinic rather than a social service office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Signor said he was unable to give an estimate of the fraud to be deterred, or to explain how officials had estimated that savings would be  $8 million the first year.</p>
        <p>The Legislature in New York had required an independent evaluation in 1995 when finger imaging was set up as a test project in 12 counties. But when every jurisdiction in the state clamored to sign up, finger imaging was required statewide.</p>
        <p>Since the study was already under way, state officials allowed it to continue. Researchers analyzing caseload trends in New York City and the 12 original counties found that before finger imaging started, the rolls were already dropping sharply.</p>
        <p>The study concludes: ''If a state or locality already has an aggressive anti-fraud program, finger-imaging may have relatively little impact, especially if multiple case fraud is not a major problem compared to other types of welfare fraud.''</p>
        <p>The study was shelved. But a 1998 audit of welfare fraud programs by H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, found that savings claimed by New York City were overstated, and asked what had happened to the evaluation. The Pataki administration would not release it, saying there was no legislative mandate to do so.</p>
        <p>David J. Heins, director of the New Jersey Division of Family Development, says overstated claims of savings have put pressure on other states to follow suit. Under the state's welfare-to-work rules, however, it is hard for a recipient to remain on the rolls at all, let alone under multiple identities, he said.</p>
        <p>But at this point, even if the program were only to break even, he and other administrators say they need finger imaging. ''We're trying to instill something here,'' he said: ''a public confidence.''</p>
