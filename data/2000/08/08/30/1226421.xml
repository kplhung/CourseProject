        <p>RUSSIA: BRINGING UP SUB'S VICTIMS -- Russian and Norwegian divers will begin next month to remove the bodies of the 118 sailors who died in the sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk. Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said that the divers would cut six holes in the sub and that Russian divers would enter to retrieve the bodies. The sub will be raised next year, he said. Mr. Klebanov repeated that Russia believes that a collision with a foreign vessel caused the sinking, rejecting American reports that a torpedo exploded inside the sub.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: BASQUE COUNCILOR SLAIN -- Gunmen believed to belong to the armed Basque separatist organization E.T.A. shot dead a young town councilor of the ruling Popular Party as he arrived to open his candy store. Manuel Indiano, 29, was hit at least 10 times in the stomach and chest in the attack in the Basque town of Zamarraga. His was the 12th killing linked to E.T.A. since it ended a unilateral truce last December, and the 7th since mid-July.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: CATHOLICS' NAZI-ERA FUND -- The Roman Catholic Church says it will set up its own $2.3 million fund to compensate Nazi-era forced laborers. Bishop Karl Lehmann said people forced to work for Catholic institutions had been excluded from a $4.7 billion fund set up by the German state and industry. The decision was criticized by Otto Lambsdorff, the government's fund negotiator, and Michael Witti, a lawyer for Jewish victims. The Protestant church paid $4.7 million into the main fund.</p>

        <p>ITALY: POPE CONDEMNS CLONING -- Pope John Paul II condemned as morally unacceptable attempts at human cloning to obtain organs for transplant involving the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, and called on scientists to look for alternative methods that respect the dignity of human beings. The pope left his summer retreat at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome to tell 5,000 transplant specialists that ''science itself points to other forms of therapeutic intervention.''</p>

        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: EX-PRESIDENT MISSING -- Ivan Stambolic, a former Serbian president and archenemy of President Slobodan Milosevic, was reported missing five days ago, and his family said it was still awaiting word of his whereabouts. His lawyer, Nikola Barovic, said, ''The fact that state-controlled media have not reported a word about the disappearance of a former Serbian president proves to me that a political decision had been made for him to be arrested.''</p>

        <p>PERU: NEW EVIDENCE IN BERENSON CASE -- President Alberto Fujimori said a military court was obligated to revoke an American woman's life prison sentence and grant a civilian trial because of new evidence suggesting that she was not a leader of a leftist rebel group. Mr. Fujimori, who previously had maintained that Lori Berenson played a leadership role among the guerrillas, declined to elaborate further on the evidence. But his suggestion points to what could be a critical element in a new trial in a civilian court because rebel leadership was a key aspect of her 1996 conviction for aggravated terrorism, also called treason in Peru.</p>

        <p>INDIA: KIDNAPPING COMPLICATION -- The Supreme Court complicated efforts to win the release of the kidnapped matinee idol Rajkumar by blocking a plan to free dozens of men said to be members of the gang run by his abductor, the South Indian outlaw Veerappan. The outlaw had demanded the release of his compatriots and the state of Karnataka had obliged by dropping criminal charges against them.</p>

        <p>INDIA: THOUSANDS FLEE FLOODS -- Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from flooded villages in Andhra Pradesh, a southern state, and the death toll has risen past 140 as heavy rains continue to raise river levels dangerously high, producing the worst flooding in decades. Forecasters say another storm system has formed over the Bay of Bengal.</p>

        <p>IRAN: STUDENTS CONDEMN TROOPS -- Iran's leading pro-reform student group accused troops under the control of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of attacking them during riots in the town of Khoramabad that left one person dead and dozens injured. A spokesman for the student Office to Consolidate Unity called on Mr. Khamenei to clarify his position on the forces fighting ''under his banner'' during the disturbances. He said 60 students were hospitalized.</p>

        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: BLAST NEAR U.S. OFFICE -- A car bomb wounded six people near the United States Consulate in Cape Town in the city's latest act of terrorism. For more than two years Cape Town has been plagued by small-scale bomb attacks, some of which the police have linked to a radical vigilante group operating in and around the city. Investigators are not sure if the consulate was the target of the bomb, which exploded about 200 yards away from the building, a police spokesman said.</p>

        <p>KENYA: F.B.I. JOINS PRIEST INQUIRY -- The United States has taken the unusual step of sending three F.B.I. agents to help with the investigation into the death of the Rev. John Kaiser, 67, an outspoken American priest, a United States official said. The three arrived after a request from the Kenyan attorney general, an embassy spokesman said. Father Kaiser, who had worked in Kenya for 36 years, was found shot dead outside Nairobi.</p>
