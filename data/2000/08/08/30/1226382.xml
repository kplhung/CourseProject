        <p>Board Administrator Going to N.Y.U.</p>
        <p>DR. ARTHUR GREENBERG, the Board of Education administrator who helped create the recent proposal to convert some underperforming city schools to privately managed charter schools and who was the longtime superintendent of District 25 in Queens, is leaving to join the New York University School of Education next month. Dr. Greenberg, 53, who most recently was supervising superintendent for executive and new school development, has worked for the Board of Education for 31 years and has been mentioned as a potential candidate for chancellor.</p>

        <p>Board Administrator Going to N.Y.U.</p>
        <p>DR. ARTHUR GREENBERG, the Board of Education administrator who helped create the recent proposal to convert some underperforming city schools to privately managed charter schools and who was the longtime superintendent of District 25 in Queens, is leaving to join the New York University School of Education next month. Dr. Greenberg, 53, who most recently was supervising superintendent for executive and new school development, has worked for the Board of Education for 31 years and has been mentioned as a potential candidate for chancellor.</p>
        <p>He will teach graduate courses in the N.Y.U.  educational administration department and help  develop programs to train school superintendents and principals. While not ruling out a candidacy for the chancellorship, Dr. Greenberg said, ''I'm entering another phase of life, where I hope to be more of an observer and less of an insider.''</p>
        <p>Edison Schools Plan Raises Questions</p>
        <p>Edison Schools, which manages public schools for profit, plans to develop its own teacher education schools. To some faculty members at the City University of New York, that would create a conflict of interest for BENNO C. SCHMIDT JR., Edison's chairman, who is also CUNY's vice chairman, because nine of CUNY's campuses offer teacher education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmidt says the plan, which might involve the creation of new undergraduate colleges, is still at too early a stage to present any possible conflict. But he does not believe it would present a conflict at any time, because it is not unusual for college presidents and professors to serve as trustees at other universities. But just in case, he said, he checked last week with CUNY's general counsel, FREDERICK P. SCHAFFER, who told him to come back for an opinion when Edison had a firmer plan about what it would do.</p>
        <p>Technology Licensing Chief Appointed</p>
        <p>Columbia University has appointed a new chief for its profitable technology licensing office, Columbia Innovation Enterprise. MICHAEL CLEARE, an executive with Johnson Matthey, a British materials and metals company, will take over as executive director from JACK GRANOWITZ. Mr. Granowitz, who has been with the office since 1983, almost since its founding, will become senior technology adviser for Columbia's executive vice provost, MICHAEL CROW. In the last fiscal year, the office brought in nearly $142 million in license and research revenue, far more than other research universities.</p>
        <p>Gotham History Center Head Named</p>
        <p>MIKE WALLACE, the historian who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 as an author of ''Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898,'' will head the new Gotham Center for New York City History at City University's Graduate Center. Mr. Wallace is a professor of history at the Graduate Center and at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, a CUNY branch.</p>
        <p>The Gotham Center will offer lectures and will  work with writers and researchers. Its board  includes the philanthropist Brooke Astor, the filmmaker Ric Burns and the writer Pete Hamill.</p>
