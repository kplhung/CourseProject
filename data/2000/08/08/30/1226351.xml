        <p>The Democratic National Committee began showing a new commercial dealing with prescription drugs in nine states yesterday, taking on the issue of the month in the presidential campaign a day after the Republican National Committee released its commercial.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Slingshot Media</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- A druggist filling a prescription, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, an old woman, a hand on a wheelchair, an elderly couple, a clerk interviewing an elderly woman, an elderly man, two shelves of pill bottles, a woman on crutches, Vice President Al Gore, a pill bottle, a prescription envelope being handed to a woman, Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore. Graphics repeat most of the words in the announcer's script. Flitting across the screen almost as fast as the pictures and too fast to read are lines across the top saying things like ''Source: C.B.O. Analysis H.R. 4680 6/28/00; U.S.A. House D.P.C. 4/14/00.'' That translates to Source: Congressional Budget Office Analysis of H.R. 4680, a bill proposed by Representative Bill Thomas, a California Republican, and Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, that would subsidize insurance companies to provide drug insurance. The companies oppose the bill, which the House passed, 217 to 214, on June 28.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Narrator: The issue: prescription drugs. George Bush's approach leaves millions of seniors with no prescription drug coverage. None. And Bush forces seniors he does include to go to H.M.O.'s and insurance companies for coverage. The National Council of Senior Citizens says, ''The Bush approach is favored by big drug companies and leaves millions with no help.'' Al Gore is taking on the big drug companies to pass a real prescription drug benefit that covers all seniors. George Bush? Siding with the big drug companies. The Gore plan: fighting for our seniors.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- On its major point, a stretch. Democrats contend that Mr. Bush wants it both ways by saying that he has a plan without giving any specifics that could be criticized. But the Democrats are also trying to have their cake and eat it, too. As Mr. Gore himself has been insisting daily, Mr. Bush does not have a prescription drug plan. ''Put up or shut up,'' he said on Monday. But the Democratic committee justifies its accusation that millions of seniors would be denied drug coverage under Mr. Bush's ''approach'' by pointing to analyses, some independent and some quite partisan, of bills he has said he likes but wants to improve upon. It is correct that the drug companies favor an approach that would have private insurers, and not the federal government, providing drug coverage.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- This is almost entirely an attack advertisement, without explanation of what Mr. Gore would do himself to see that the elderly have prescription drug coverage. The fact that it is, formally at least, coming from the Democratic National Committee and not from Mr. Gore's campaign may be intended to distance the candidate from its negativity. But that is a distinction without a difference to viewers.</p>
