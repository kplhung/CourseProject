        <p>Lutece Loses Chef</p>

        <p>Lutece Loses Chef</p>
        <p>After six years as executive chef of the venerable Lutece, Eberhard Muller is moving on. In October, he will become a partner in Bayard's on Hanover Square in the financial district, where he will be the executive chef. Mr. Muller and his partners,  Harry Poulakakos and his son, Peter, also plan to turn Harry's at Hanover Square into a steakhouse.</p>
        <p>Payard Stands Alone</p>
        <p>Francois Payard now owns Payard Patisserie and Bistro, 1032 Lexington Avenue (73rd Street), having bought out his partners, Daniel Boulud and Joel Smilow. All parties agree the parting was amicable. Mr. Payard says he is also planning to open more Payard Patisseries and next week will also start selling a line of frozen pastries, to be made in France from his recipes, to hotels, clubs and cruise ships. ''We have orders for a million macaroons a day,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Upscale Williamsburg</p>
        <p>Fernicola Osteria is a newcomer to the dining scene in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, moving into a 1901 building at 119 Kent Avenue (North Seventh Street). The chef, Barbara Bogart, is creating Italian-accented seafood dishes like roast lobster with fava bean fritters.</p>
        <p>East Side Asian</p>
        <p>Having put Sam Hazen in charge of a brasserie menu at his Rue 57 on West 57th Street, Marc Packer is about to test the chef's mettle with Asian cuisines. In October, the two are opening Tao-Buddha Bar and Restaurant at 42 East 58th Street, the site of a former movie theater. The projection booth will become a private dining room and, like the rest of the 300-seat enterprise, it will offer a culinary tour of Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Thailand. Mr. Hazen recently visited those places to pick up pointers.</p>
        <p>92 and Counting</p>
        <p>Ken Aretsky is turning the space that was Busby's in the Hotel Wales at 92nd Street and Madison Avenue into a 100-seat American-style brasserie. The restaurant, to be named Ninety-Two, will open in January for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>
