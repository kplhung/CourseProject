        <hl1>Mr. Ray's Ill-Timed Report</hl1>
      </hedline>
      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial urges independent counsel Robert W Ray to delay report on Pres Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton until after New York State Senate election; says report is almost certain to pass judgment on Mrs Clinton's behavior and subsequent testimony relating to various allegations; says given Ray's inability thus far to bring any indictments, need for orderly election overrides need for detailed report</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>From the moment he succeeded Kenneth Starr as independent counsel, Robert W. Ray has been aware of the need to conclude the investigations of President and Mrs. Clinton in a fair and timely way, without needlessly disrupting the campaign season. Mr. Ray has dribbled out reports on two elements of a broad inquiry that has lasted more than five years and cost $50 million. Now, according to a story by Neil A. Lewis in Tuesday's Times, Mr. Ray plans to deliver the third and potentially most controversial report in mid-September or shortly thereafter -- in other words, just when the New York senatorial contest between Mrs. Clinton and Representative Rick Lazio is kicking into high gear.</p>
        <p>This page has long supported a full investigation of Whitewater and all the other unresolved allegations involving Bill and Hillary Clinton that disappeared from public view during the Lewinsky scandal. In March, Mr. Ray reported on allegations that the White House had improperly collected confidential F.B.I. files, which he attributed to a bureaucratic foul-up. In June, he reported on Mrs. Clinton's role in the firing of seven White House travel office employees. Though he found no grounds for prosecution, Mr. Ray was correctly critical, in our view, of Mrs. Clinton's sworn statements that she had nothing to do with the dismissals.</p>

        <p>From the moment he succeeded Kenneth Starr as independent counsel, Robert W. Ray has been aware of the need to conclude the investigations of President and Mrs. Clinton in a fair and timely way, without needlessly disrupting the campaign season. Mr. Ray has dribbled out reports on two elements of a broad inquiry that has lasted more than five years and cost $50 million. Now, according to a story by Neil A. Lewis in Tuesday's Times, Mr. Ray plans to deliver the third and potentially most controversial report in mid-September or shortly thereafter -- in other words, just when the New York senatorial contest between Mrs. Clinton and Representative Rick Lazio is kicking into high gear.</p>
        <p>This page has long supported a full investigation of Whitewater and all the other unresolved allegations involving Bill and Hillary Clinton that disappeared from public view during the Lewinsky scandal. In March, Mr. Ray reported on allegations that the White House had improperly collected confidential F.B.I. files, which he attributed to a bureaucratic foul-up. In June, he reported on Mrs. Clinton's role in the firing of seven White House travel office employees. Though he found no grounds for prosecution, Mr. Ray was correctly critical, in our view, of Mrs. Clinton's sworn statements that she had nothing to do with the dismissals.</p>
        <p>The third report will deal with the allegations that originally got everyone's attention, mainly that the Clintons had used their influence during Mr. Clinton's years as governor to prop up a failing Arkansas savings and loan, and that Mrs. Clinton in particular had not been fully candid about her role. Those issues had been raised initially by investigative reports in the Times.</p>
        <p>But if the independent counsel had the evidence to bring a criminal indictment against Mrs. Clinton on Whitewater, he should have and would have done so by now. At this point, given Mr. Ray's inability to bring indictments, the need for an orderly election overrides the need for a detailed report summing up the prosecutor's findings. In such a report, Mr. Ray is almost certain to pass judgment on Mrs. Clinton's behavior and subsequent testimony, much as he did in the Travelgate report. It is because of this that fundamental questions of timing and fair play arise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray argues that a mid-September release will leave plenty of time for comment and rebuttal. This ignores political reality. Mr. Ray has had months to bring a prosecution or to get information of persuasive political importance before the voters. In the absence of stunning new information worthy of prosecution, he should stand aside and let the voters decide based on the existing voluminous public record. If Mr. Ray cares at all about his credibility, and about whether the public sees his report as an objective document or a time bomb lobbed at Mrs. Clinton's campaign, he will delay it until after the election.</p>
