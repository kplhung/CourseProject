        <p>Wheeling a suitcase behind them, Rhoda and Mark L. Berenson looked like any retired couple off for a vacation as they waited in an American Airlines ticket line at La Guardia Airport yesterday afternoon. But the man in front of them in line knew otherwise.</p>
        <p>''Are they going to release your daughter?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Although she had appeared on every news report the night before, Mrs. Berenson was startled. ''We're so known,'' she murmured.</p>
        <p>But then she realized that the man was not exactly a stranger. He was Brad Blakeman, a lawyer who works for the George W. Bush campaign and one of the many critical contacts she and her husband have made over their four years of writing letters, visiting lawmakers and talking to anyone who would listen about the plight of their daughter, Lori Helene Berenson, 30. In January 1996, Ms. Berenson, 30, was convicted by a masked military tribunal of conspiring to attack the Peruvian congress, and has been imprisoned high in the Peruvian mountains on a life sentence ever since.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berenson, a lifelong Democrat, started in on Mr. Blakeman, rattling off the names of Republicans who support his efforts to free his daughter. After the encounter, Mr. Berenson said, ''We desperately need a way to get to George W.''</p>
        <p>It had been just over 24 hours since the United States Embassy had called to tell the Berensons that their daughter was to be given a new civil trial. Since then, Mr. Berenson said, they answered 100 e-mail messages, held a news conference outside their apartment near Gramercy Park, planned another news conference with Jesse Jackson, and packed their bags for yesterday's flight to Chicago to appear on Oprah Winfrey's  television show. The show's segment, ''The Fight of Your Life,'' had been scheduled before the big news.</p>
        <p>Since their daughter's arrest, the Berensons have gone from professors to crusaders. They retired from their jobs -- he taught statistics at Baruch College and she taught physics at Nassau Community College -- to devote themselves, and a considerable amount of cash, to the Committee to Free Lori Berenson. And they have steadfastly maintained her innocence, despite skepticism from United States officials and some human rights advocates.</p>
        <p>They have learned to talk Peruvian politics and that letters to their daughter, which have to be in Spanish so the censors can read them, should say ''translated by a computer'' at the top in case there is some incendiary mistake. They have learned where to buy knitting yarn in Arequipa, where they stay when they go to Peru to visit their daughter, taking turns every few weeks.</p>
        <p>Their experience has taught them, too, that the announcement of a new trial may not be the breakthrough many have taken it to be. The Berensons have welcomed the news, but cautiously.</p>
        <p>They have already had their hopes raised and dashed countless times, said Mrs. Berenson, 57. There was the time in June 1998 when Peru's new prime minister said Ms. Berenson should be pardoned and sent home, only to be immediately contradicted by the country's real power, President Alberto K. Fujimori.</p>
        <p>Then there was December 1998, when the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, a guerrilla group, took over the residence of Japan's ambassador to Peru. The incident seemed so similar to the one Ms. Berenson had been accused of devising with the same group that it jeopardized attempts to secure her a new trial. More recently, prison guards said Ms. Berenson was drawing an escape plan, but it was actually just a knitting diagram for a cat pattern that her mother admired.</p>
        <p>''It's very difficult to be an individual human being depending on a large government for your life, because they're just not geared to focus on individuals,'' Mrs. Berenson said. ''It's like what that one congressman said: Lori is like a little shrimp caught between two giant whales.''</p>
        <p>''Congressman James Talent, a Republican from Missouri,'' Mr. Berenson supplied.</p>
        <p>The Berensons would much rather talk about their daughter than their own work to free her. That, they say with a shrug, is just what any parents would do. Indeed, they often seem to be nothing more than regular parents.</p>
        <p>But events have cast them into the unexpected. Mrs. Berenson is now an expert on prisons, and Mr. Berenson, 58, wants to continue working for human rights. ''I have the idea that Lori will be working with me,'' he said. Then, he was back to sounding like a normal parent: ''Of course, no one wants to work with their father all of the time.''</p>
