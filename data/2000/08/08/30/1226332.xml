        <p>Addressing the Mexican government's abuse of indigenous people and opposition groups in Chiapas is absent from the challenges that Vicente Fox, Mexico's president-elect,  identifies in his Aug. 25 Op-Ed article.</p>
        <p>In Chiapas, social services are offered on condition of political support, illegal roadblocks prevent select communities from seeking health care, some women have undergone forced sterilization procedures, and government health services are denied to indigenous people and opposition groups.</p>

        <p>Addressing the Mexican government's abuse of indigenous people and opposition groups in Chiapas is absent from the challenges that Vicente Fox, Mexico's president-elect,  identifies in his Aug. 25 Op-Ed article.</p>
        <p>In Chiapas, social services are offered on condition of political support, illegal roadblocks prevent select communities from seeking health care, some women have undergone forced sterilization procedures, and government health services are denied to indigenous people and opposition groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox advocates ''institutional guarantees of human and civil rights'' for Mexicans in the United States, but he must also secure these rights for all Mexicans living on Mexican soil.</p>
