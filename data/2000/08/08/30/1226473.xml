        <p>The tensions in Croatia have subsided and his sister's cancer is in remission; therefore, Goran Ivanisevic has little to motivate himself anymore. He cannot even throw a proper tantrum these days.</p>
        <p>Prone to hyperbole that matches his wildly unpredictable game, the 28-year-old Croat, who ranked in the top 20 for nine straight years before falling dramatically in the last two years, never fails to make a statement even in defeat.</p>
        <p>Dominik Hrbaty, ranked No. 36 in the world, downed a strangely unmotivated Ivanisevic, 3-6, 6-0, 6-1, 6-0, yesterday. Bothered by pain in his left rotator cuff, which doctors determined last week would require surgery, Ivanisevic has been taking cortisone shots ever since. But the Croat, now ranked 77th, did not blame his injury on his malaise.</p>
        <p>''It's just happening that I don't have fun anymore to play,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the postmatch interview, Ivanisevic said he was pondering retirement, but contradicted himself a few times. ''It's no fun to retire like this,'' he said. He is still planning to go to Sydney to play Olympic singles and doubles for Croatia. And then later he added: ''I just want to maybe try one more time, maybe find somebody to, you know, kick me a little bit, maybe I wake up. If I cannot wake up, I don't know, then it is best to stop.''</p>
        <p>Ivanisevic has made 12 first-round exits in a Grand Slam in his 13-year career. But this season is by far his worst. He has lost in the first round of a tournament 12 times this season and for two years has not won a title.</p>
        <p>But Ivanisevic said there were no longer any outside motivation for him. ''Everything stopped, nothing to play for anymore,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, he muttered that his game seemed staid, much like his career. ''Museum match, when you go to a museum, that's how I played,'' he said.</p>
