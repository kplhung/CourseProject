        <p>The only HBO series apparently unsure of its future is ''Arliss,'' the five-year-old comedy about a sports agent.

        <p>''I think we bring a new audience after 'Sex and the City,' '' he said, 'though we've been keeping more and more of their viewers.''</p>
        <p>An HBO spokesman said that ''Six Feet Under,'' if it becomes a series, may get a shot at filling the half-hour behind ''Sex and the City,'' which may have some impact on the future of ''Arliss.'' But Mr. Albrecht has said he would like to keep expanding the number of series on HBO, which may mean more seasons for all the current entries.</p>
