        <p>I'M sorry, I don't see you in the computer at all,'' the ticket agent at the Continental Airlines counter said. She had been very helpful, tapping away diligently, looking for my name and the electronic ticket that I insisted would be attached to it.</p>
        <p>Beside me, my wife looked plenty worried. She always travels with a paper ticket, which she books through a travel agent. But I sometimes use e-tickets, booking bargain fares through one of the online travel sites.</p>
        <p>On this day in mid-August, we were traveling together on separate business, happily to the same place: Phoenix. We'd also tacked on a week of vacation, planning to finish our chores within a few days and then drive down to Tucson to ride horses for a week at a ranch in the Sonoran Desert.</p>
        <p>The ticket clerk stopped tapping and gave me a look of dark sympathy. The word ''whoa'' formed in my mind. This is embarrassing to admit, considering that I write a newspaper column about, ahem, business travel, but it seems that I had showed up at the airport with a piece of paper that said ''Arizona Trip'' across the top. The paper, which I thought was a printout of a confirmed e-ticket reservation, was in fact nothing more than a printout of a planned itinerary.</p>
        <p>Through my own dumb fault, when I thought I was booking my multiple-destination ticket online about six weeks earlier, I had neglected to click through to actually complete the purchase. I had printed out the incomplete itinerary and tucked it in my travel folder, blissfully unaware that I didn't have a ticket. Now the plane was about to board, and all I had was a sheet of typing paper.</p>
        <p>Worse, the flight was full except for a single first-class seat, priced at a terrifying $2,200, one-way. Worse yet, there was no flexibility in my schedule. I absolutely had to be in Phoenix that night for a series of interviews starting the next morning.</p>
        <p>In a fix like this, who you gonna call? Well, friends, you better believe I called a travel agent.</p>
        <p>My wife flew off on schedule. Desperate, I phoned American Express and explained the problem. The agent tapped for about 30 seconds and, voila, I was booked a few hours later on a nonstop Continental flight from Newark to Phoenix, with a return flight from Tucson. What's more, the agent informed me that I was automatically upgraded to first class, since I was paying full fare. I got to Phoenix only about six hours behind schedule, and we were galloping across the desert a week after that.</p>
        <p>I wish I could report that the cost to keep me on schedule was somewhere close to the original $660 fare I believed I had booked online. In fact, it was about $2,100, round trip. This illustrates the difference between the prices for air fares paid by most leisure travelers, who have the flexibility to book well in advance, and business travelers, who often do not have any flexibility and have to make last-minute arrangements.</p>
        <p>But my experience also illustrates a reason major travel-management companies, after a few years in which the travel agent world has been rocked and compressed by the virtual disappearance of commissions from airlines, are feeling pretty optimistic these days.</p>
        <p>''You get jammed up on a trip, and it sure is nice to pick up the phone and have someone fix the problem right away,'' said Hal Rosenbluth, the chief executive of Rosenbluth International, one of the top five United States-based corporate travel-management companies.</p>
        <p>In recent years, hundreds of small travel agencies have gone out of business as airlines sharply reduced commissions. But at the annual convention of the National Business Travel Association in Los Angeles last month, representatives from the big travel-management companies were sounding quite happy.</p>
        <p>Smart travel-management companies, which now charge fees for services rendered rather than depending on commissions from the airlines, are in fact prospering in a new competitive environment that cedes a small portion of the market to the pure online bargain bookings and at the same time opens up more room for specialized services, especially for corporate travel.</p>
        <p>The big agencies are ''no longer seen as intermediaries for the airlines,'' said Jud Linville, president for corporate services at American Express, where air travel bookings grew 13 percent last year, to $10.9 billion. Travel management has become ''a very rational business -- we get paid for the value we create,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In fact, the big travel agencies are actually scrambling to hire people.  ''The industry now has a lot of technology with not a lot of forethought,'' said Mr. Rosenbluth, whose company booked $2.5 billion in air sales last year, according to Business Travel News, a trade publication. ''One of our real concerns now is the need to attract good people'' to handle growing customer service demands.</p>
        <p>''It's going to come down to who can attract, train and retain the best people,'' he said.</p>
