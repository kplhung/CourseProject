        <p>Things had been looking up in this long-suffering city. Downtown was thriving again, the new mayor was still savoring his honeymoon and this month's Republican National Convention left Philadelphians with a feel-good, ego-boosting bounce.</p>
        <p>But the euphoria has come crashing down with a spate of building collapses that have helped to remind people here that there is a crumbling wasteland of neglected neighborhoods just beyond the glittering city center.</p>
        <p>A soggy summer, decades of deferred maintenance and Philadelphia's swampy past have conspired against the city's 30,000 vacant and decaying row houses, most of them north of the office buildings and hotels that have sprouted downtown.</p>
        <p>Since last Thursday, 25 buildings have come down, either partially or fully, and city officials estimate that another 3,100 are in imminent danger of falling. So far no one has been seriously hurt, though two men were slightly injured by the collapse of a wooden awning. Until last week, the city averaged about 20 collapses a year.</p>
        <p>''When is it going to stop?'' Robert Solvibile, the commissioner in charge of abandoned buildings, asked with exasperation. ''This is unbelievable.''</p>
        <p>Calling the rash of collapses a crisis, housing officials commandeered a police helicopter this morning and began an aerial survey of the city's most dilapidated neighborhoods. Mr. Solvibile said airborne inspectors had spotted more than a dozen buildings on the verge of tumbling down.</p>
        <p>In an effort to triple its cadre of 20 inspectors by the end of the week, the city is teaching housing authority employees how to spot a dangerously decaying row house. Officials say they plan to double the number of emergency demolitions to about 60 a week.</p>
        <p>''We see a problem, and we're determined to make sure it's solved before it becomes a tragedy,'' said Barbara Grant, a spokeswoman for Mayor John F. Street, who has been in office since January.</p>
        <p>Despite the recent blush of prosperity, much of Philadelphia, with a population of 1.4 million, remains untouched by the good times. The city is still saddled with tracts of abandoned houses, the legacy of a hemorrhaging of 500,000 residents that began in the 1950's. During years of mismanagement and municipal bankruptcy, the rows of elegantly detailed brick houses, many now vacant, began to fall into disrepair.</p>
        <p>Even occupied houses began to crumble as their owners grew older and poorer. Mark Alan Hughes, a professor of public policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said recent studies indicated that more than half of all home owners in the city were over 60 years old.</p>
        <p>''You have elderly widows who haven't been up to the third floor in years,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''Then a little leak in the roof and a rainy summer can lead to a disaster.''</p>
        <p>Philadelphia's swampy terrain has also contributed to the sagging foundations and listing facades. Although William Penn built his colonial outpost on solid ground, the 19th-century builders who threw up thousands of brick-faced row houses for the growing middle class were not as thoughtful. Many of the most troubled neighborhoods were built on the soot and debris that developers used to fill in the marshes that once stretched alongside the Schuylkill and Delaware River.</p>
        <p>Even wealthy home owners are bedeviled by the unstable ground, said Mr. Hughes, who had to shore up the walls of his 1866 home with reinforcing rods.</p>
        <p>''If you have the resources, you can deal with it,'' he said. ''If you don't, it can be catastrophic.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, other aging cities have tackled the problem of abandoned housing with more success.  Chicago, Baltimore and New York have aggressive programs to quickly identity and demolish buildings at risk of falling down. Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings in New York, said there were only a handful of collapsed buildings incidents last year, most of them involving new construction. ''We just don't have as many empty buildings as we used to,'' Ms. Fink said.</p>
        <p>As part of his mayoral campaign last year, Mayor Street made urban renewal a central theme and he has promised a $250-million neighborhood rehabilitation program that will be paid for with bonds.</p>
        <p>Many of those who live in the city's more bedraggled neighborhoods say they have already seen some improvements. Soon after his election, the mayor began a program that removed more than 30,000 abandoned cars from local streets. Even before the recent spell of collapses, a fast-track demolition process allowed contractors to dismantle houses as soon as they were condemned by inspectors.</p>
        <p>Despite the improvements, it was hard to find anyone in North Philadelphia with rosy predictions of rebirth. After years of living with drugs, poverty and violent crime, many residents said they now had a new fear: dying beneath a pile bricks.</p>
        <p>Standing in front of a vacant lot on 29th Street, Charles Bark, 14, recalled how the house there had quietly fallen in on itself a few days earlier.</p>
        <p>''The cloud of dust was so thick, I couldn't see anything,'' he said, shaking his head. He looked down the block and gestured to dozens of other forlorn houses, their facades peeling off, others with roofs supporting small groves of trees.</p>
        <p>''We hang out in front of these abandoned buildings,'' he said. ''Any one of those could go. Our house could fall. The house next door could fall. We just don't know anymore.''</p>
