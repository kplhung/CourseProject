        <p>Does anyone fret about the moral implications of laying a trap for a chess opponent? Do we worry about the implications for society's value system when one poker player bluffs another into folding? Of course not. A ruthless poker player can be the soul of virtue and decency when he gets up from the table.</p>

        <p>Re '' 'Survivor,' and Our Lives Today'' (letters, Aug. 26):</p>
        <p>Does anyone fret about the moral implications of laying a trap for a chess opponent? Do we worry about the implications for society's value system when one poker player bluffs another into folding? Of course not. A ruthless poker player can be the soul of virtue and decency when he gets up from the table.</p>
        <p>In those cases, we keep in mind what many seem to have forgotten about ''Survivor''; it was only a game, cleverly dressed up to look like ''reality.'' Yet it seems many viewers mistook it for that.</p>
        <p>Richard Hatch understood that a certain amount of Machiavellian scheming was needed to win. Judging his real-world morals and character by his game play is unfair and naive.</p>
