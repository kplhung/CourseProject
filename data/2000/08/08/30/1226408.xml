        <p>The Foster's Brewing Group's $1.14 billion acquisition of Beringer Wine Estates Holdings is likely to prompt a new wave of consolidation among California's premium wineries, analysts and industry executives said today. The deal, they said, effectively puts the ownership of significant independent winemakers in play.</p>
        <p>News of the offer for Beringer by Foster, the Australian beer and wine company, came a day after another California wine producer, R. H. Phillips, said it would be purchased by Vincor International of Canada for $92 million.</p>
        <p>Other independent winemakers that could become takeover targets include Kendall-Jackson, Robert Mondavi and Sutter Home. Kendall-Jackson, considered a likely candidate for an initial public offering, had been in talks with Beringer about a possible merger, but the talks broke off last week, an executive close to the winery said, because of conditions raised by Jess Jackson, Kendall-Jackson's founder.</p>
        <p>In acquiring Beringer, Foster is buying the oldest operating winery in the Napa Valley of California, with 10,200 acres of vineyards. Beringer -- which over the years has grown well beyond its onetime boutique-winery status -- had sales of $700 million in the fiscal year that ended in June. In addition to Beringer labels, its brands include Chateau St. Jean, Souverain and Napa Ridge.</p>
        <p>Foster already owns several leading Australian winemakers, and in February, it bought Windsor Vineyards in the Sonoma Valley of California, the No. 2 direct seller of wine in the United States.</p>
        <p>Discussing the acquisition of Beringer, Jean-Michelle Valette, a wine industry consultant and former president of Franciscan Vineyards, said, ''It's a bellwether deal,'' and adding: ''While there were half a dozen premium wine companies that had all attained the same scale over time, all of a sudden you now have a clearly dominant player, with global reach and distribution in a number of significant markets. I think it's going to cause a big scramble among the others.''</p>
        <p>Shares of Beringer rose $10.25 today, to $55.31. Robert Mondavi added $1.13, to $40. Class A shares of Canandaigua Brands, of Fairport, N.Y., were up $2.19, to $53.81.</p>
