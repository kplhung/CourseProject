        <p>WHAT a lovely summer this has been in New York -- at least until Mets started hobbling off the field last night.</p>
        <p>The summer seemed glorious yesterday morning when the Mets woke up in their collective beds in New York in a tie for the best record in baseball, while the Yankees stirred in their respective hotel rooms in Seattle still ensconced in first place.</p>
        <p>''We play this game for the fans,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''It should never be lost in the shuffle. If you're a fan of the Mets, you've waited weeks, months, years for this.''</p>
        <p>Shortly after Valentine said this, along came the inevitable stinker. The Mets totally bungled things against the Astros -- you don't want to know -- in an 11-1 loss in a fresh and autumnal Shea Stadium, while the Braves' home game against the Reds was flickering on the scoreboard.</p>
        <p>The only cheer of the night came when the Reds rallied for a lead. Cincinnati won, 4-2, leaving New York and Atlanta tied for first place for another night. It is not yet September, but scoreboard watching is officially in season.</p>
        <p>The only thing more fun than having one winning baseball team is having two, and New York is currently blessed with that.</p>
        <p>There has been 12 o'clock lightning in two boroughs, and there has been midnight suspense from Western time zones when it was impossible to turn off the television set and get some sleep, and there was even Benny Agbayani's grand slam from Japan just as day people were getting ready to go to work.</p>
        <p>The Mets are clearly the novelty act in this city of good feeling, not having been in first place this late in a season since 1990. Bear in mind that last October's heroics came only after a season of bickering and brinksmanship, skittering slumps and flailing egos. Now the Mets have the best record in baseball since the All-Star Game break, and there is far more serenity.</p>
        <p>''Am I injured or being rested?'' Robin (.234) Ventura asked Valentine when he was informed that Valentine was giving Lenny (.261) Harris some work at third base last night. Ventura and Valentine laughed, a far cry from recent years when Valentine had to deal with assorted mutineers and grumps, and was occasionally tetchy himself.</p>
        <p>On this night of nights, however, Harris clanked a soft, catchable liner to set off a four-run rally. Later, Al Leiter went off with a strained gluteus muscle and Derek Bell went off with a bruised knee after running into a fence. The loss only underscored Valentine's theory that the tie for first was not significant, just yet.</p>
        <p>''When you're playing, the daily thing is important,'' Valentine said. ''You just play 'em. I understand totally that the only standings that count are at the end of the year.''</p>
        <p>Valentine, however, did note, ''We were five or six games behind only two weeks ago.''</p>
        <p>The Mets had the feeling that the Braves knew they had been caught, at least temporarily.</p>
        <p>''We were always the team that was behind the Braves,'' Agbayani said. ''They'll be aware of it.''</p>
        <p>Agbayani thought last year's nervous-making wild-card heroics had led to a calmer Mets team this time around.</p>
        <p>''I enjoyed last year, it was so exciting,'' said Agbayani, who was a rookie then. ''We kept wondering: 'Are we going? Aren't we going?' We had to wait out the wild card. After last season, you feel you can do it all, not just the wild card. As a team, we've been through it.''</p>
        <p>Agbayani knows the drill now. Last days of August, home game, the United States Open across the way.</p>
        <p>''It's absolutely amazing how they return first serve,'' said Agbayani, talking about men who regularly return serves of 125 miles an hour. ''I couldn't touch those serves. Maybe the second serve, even with the spin they put on it.''</p>
        <p>He and a few teammates wandered back across the boardwalk for what turned out to be an ugly loss. They now have 30 games left in a season that can only be exciting, one way or the other.</p>
        <p>How hard it is to take even a day away from baseball to ponder the Open or to delve into rumors of another year of professional football. How excruciating it is to think about the bizarre charm of synchronized swimming and dressage at the Summer Games in Sydney.</p>
        <p>It is too soon to prattle of a Subway Series, but given the evidence that these are a decent bunch of guys in Queens and the Bronx, only the most sour Met and Yankee fans can work up a hatred for the other side in a season that has been so sweet, so far.</p>
