        <p>While horse racing's marketers have extolled their own performances but called for more consolidation to save the industry, two of the sport's most aggressive executives have driven forward on parallel paths with their own solution: buying and networking racetracks across America.</p>
        <p>The two are Frank Stronach, president of Magna Entertainment, and Tom Meeker, president of Churchill Downs. Between them, they now own 13 racetracks and control 40 percent of the market share of racing's $13.7 billion gambling business.</p>
        <p>In the last two years, Stronach and his worldwide auto-parts company have spent more than $300 million to buy Santa Anita, Golden Gate Fields and Bay Meadows in California, Gulfstream Park in Florida, Remington Park in Oklahoma and Thistledown and Great Lakes Downs in Ohio. And they make no secret of the fact that they would like to add Monmouth Park in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Churchill Downs, meanwhile, has spent more than $325 million in cash or stock to acquire Hollywood Park in California, Calder Race Course in Florida, Ellis Park in Kentucky and Arlington International in Illinois. Those tracks joined a company that already included Hoosier Park in Indiana and Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby, the premier race in the sport.</p>
        <p>Meeker, a 56-year-old lawyer who has been calling the shots at Churchill Downs since 1984, arrived early in Saratoga Springs this month for the annual Round Table Conference of racing owners and officials on Aug. 13. The main message this year was delivered by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, which is still debt-ridden in its third year as racing's ''league office.'' But Meeker put his own goal bluntly:</p>
        <p>''Our objective is to reach a critical mass, to deliver our product to the people of the United States and, ultimately, the world.''</p>
        <p>By product, he meant horse racing and the gambling that goes with it. But Meeker said he was not threatening to crush small tracks under the advancing armor of large tracks.</p>
        <p>''It will help the industry,'' he said, ''if we recognize that there will be consolidation. There will be dominant players. The smaller tracks fear that 'these big boys are going to try to put us out of business.'</p>
        <p>''But Frank Stronach and the New York Racing Association group and the other big players, we don't want to put anybody out of business. We want them to stay in business to take our product.''</p>
        <p>Stronach, a 67-year-old Canadian who runs his global empire from Toronto, speaks of his racetracks as entertainment centers with family appeal. He is also a successful horseman. His Stronach Stables produced Red Bullet, winner of this year's Preakness. And he has openly contested the spending and tax methods of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.</p>
        <p>''Each track will have its separate needs,'' Stronach said, reviewing his goals. ''When I first went to Santa Anita, I noticed that the soup in the dining room wasn't hot enough. At Gulfstream Park, there has been some problem with the condition of the turf course. And they have racing for only 60 days or so each year.</p>
        <p>''You have to make sure of the product you are selling. And you can enhance it with entertainment that is appropriate and meaningful to the public.''</p>
        <p>Stronach, a focused man from Austria with a great mane of white hair, takes pride in the benefits that Magna has installed for its employees, such as bonus payments and a voice in the company. He is forcefully direct in manner. He wasted no time in starting major construction projects at Santa Anita (and making sure the soup was hot) after he bought the track last year.</p>
        <p>The family of racetracks operating under the banners of Meeker and Stronach already control two essential ingredients of racing: the horses and the betting money. Lonny Powell, the director of racing for Magna and Stronach's chief deputy, said from his office at Santa Anita that this was part of the strategy.</p>
        <p>''The biggest problem in our industry,'' he said, ''is to guarantee the supply of horses. It might be a stretch in some places, but if you control racing circuits, you guarantee fuller fields.''</p>
        <p>So, in the struggle to gather racetracks into circuits with common goals, where does Magna stand?</p>
        <p>''Probably, we're getting to the early part of the middle,'' Powell said. ''The first part was very accelerated. But we'll continue as long as the moves are part of our plan.</p>
        <p>''Our plan has three aspects. First, to achieve as much efficiency as possible from standing tracks. Second, in markets where it's doable, to enhance the year-round facilities of tracks in a racing environment, tracks like Santa Anita and Gulfstream, with their great locations. And third, to build a simulcasting network with the tracks associated with Magna, with home betting obviously the aim.''</p>
        <p>So far, Stronach and Meeker have not squeezed the lemon dry. Despite the expenditure of $325 million in cash or capital to expand Churchill's network, Meeker said no drain on resources had been felt.</p>
        <p>''None of this has put a strain on our resources,'' he said. ''With the acquisition of Arlington Park this year in exchange for stock, our debt ratio actually dropped.''</p>
        <p>What role will the New York Racing Association play, and what damage may it suffer, if Stronach and Meeker keep rolling forward? It is conceivable that the N.Y.R.A. may even end up competing with Stronach and Meeker in the bidding for New York's Off-Track Betting Corporation.</p>
        <p>''You're always concerned that you can keep offering high-quality racing,'' said Terry Meyocks, president of the N.Y.R.A., which has a state franchise to operate the Belmont Park, Aqueduct and Saratoga tracks. ''All we can do is try to keep offering the best product we can. We hope we're important enough to hold our own in any racing business, no matter who dominates it.''</p>
        <p>But Meyocks pointed out that the N.Y.R.A., with a 20 percent share of the national gambling market in racing, held a special legal position that would preclude it from joining the gold rush.</p>
        <p>''They would have to change the law in New York State before we could acquire tracks outside,'' he said. ''We're licensed to run the three franchise tracks in New York, but none others.''</p>
        <p>Meantime, Stronach and Meeker keep casting their eyes and their money coast to coast, pursuing consolidation, which they are betting will revive horse racing before it is too late.</p>
