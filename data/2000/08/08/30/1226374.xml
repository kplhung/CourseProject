        <p>IN January, a semiconductor company called Transmeta promised technology that would allow laptop computer batteries to last a full workday.

And its Crusoe processors promise to be contenders in a rapidly growing market for laptops and mobile computing devices.</p>

        <p>IN January, a semiconductor company called Transmeta promised technology that would allow laptop computer batteries to last a full workday. Though such long-lasting laptops are at least weeks away from their planned delivery date -- Transmeta has signed deals with prominent computer makers, including I.B.M. and Sony -- the company has filed for an initial offering.</p>
        <p>That public stock offering is widely expected to get a blazing reception, despite a market far cooler to new technology offerings than last year's. After all, the company is backed by two prominent billionaire investors, the financier George Soros and Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft. Its star employee is Linus Torvalds, the 30-year-old native of Finland who created the free Linux operating system and who is revered by many young programmers. And its Crusoe processors promise to be contenders in a rapidly growing market for laptops and mobile computing devices.</p>
        <p>Still, some professional investors are not too optimistic about how the dust will settle after the offering. They point out that the devices with Transmeta processors have not yet reached the public, and the company has recorded $119.4 million in losses in just over five years. And then there is Intel. Though technology analysts say Transmeta's technology will have advantages in the mobile computing market, Intel has proved a fierce competitor time and again.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Torvalds's presence, Transmeta is not a company whose business is based around the Linux operating system; it is a semiconductor company that plans to use Linux in conjunction with some of its chip designs. Nonetheless, some analysts and money managers raise the specter of slumping Linux-related stocks when talking about Transmeta. After huge public offerings last year, shares of Red Hat and VA Linux Systems have lost in excess of 70 percent each this year.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a hot I.P.O. with a big valuation,'' said Christopher J. Bonavico, who manages two technology-driven mutual funds, with about $620 million in assets, for the insurer Transamerica. Mr. Bonavico does not plan on participating.</p>
        <p>''Investing in nifty technology is very dangerous,'' he added. ''Look where Red Hat is now. You could say I would've bought it and then sold it, but someone always gets left holding the bag.''</p>
        <p>Ashok Kumar, a semiconductor analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, was even more skeptical.</p>
        <p>''Initially, there was a lot of hype, which has since died down,'' he said. ''I don't think you can classify their approach as revolutionary. I don't think the niches Intel is leaving unfilled are big enough to establish a business model. When your competitor is Intel, it's a risky proposition. Previous attempts to find chinks in their armor have failed.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, William D. Savoy, president of Vulcan Ventures, Mr. Allen's venture capital firm, called Transmeta ''one of the most exciting hardware investments we've ever made.'' He added, ''It's so appropriate to bring this technology out when the world is moving to lower and lower power-consumption devices.''</p>
        <p>Venu Reddy, a semiconductor analyst at the fund manager Waddell &amp; Reed, which did not invest in Transmeta in the private market, said his firm would probably participate in the offering, even though he did not believe that the Crusoe processor was as groundbreaking as advertised.</p>
        <p>''Just because you use the Transmeta processor doesn't mean your battery power will be improved by leaps and bounds,'' he said. Still, ''even if Transmeta gets 5 percent of the market, we can make a lot of money,'' he added.</p>
        <p>In an industry that analysts estimate at $40 billion a year, a new company might not need a leading role to succeed.</p>
        <p>But Transmeta has high expectations for a company that has yet to see products with its semiconductors hit the market. The date of its offering, which has Morgan Stanley Dean Witter as the lead underwriter, has not been set, nor has a price range. But Transmeta's initial plan is to raise $200 million for 10 percent of its company, according to people close to the concern, giving it an implied valuation of $2 billion. At that price, it would need about $128 million in annual sales to achieve a price-to-sales ratio comparable to that of Intel.</p>
        <p>Transmeta has a built-in audience, the technophiles that are fans of Mr. Torvalds and are curious about Transmeta's chip design, which uses software for functions that conventional chips do with transistors. That, in conjunction with other design features, will allow laptop batteries to run for up to eight hours, instead of two to four, the company has said.</p>
        <p>Before the company unveiled its technology at a heavily attended news conference in January, Transmeta labored under a veil of silence and nondisclosure agreements. It was not even entirely clear it could be called a semiconductor company. The approach only inflamed curiosity about the company, which was incorporated in 1995.</p>
        <p>''I think there's a huge amount of interest, and not just because Linus is a part of it,'' said Jeff Bates, the executive editor of Slashdot.org, an online journal for technology enthusiasts that is a unit of VA Linux. ''A lot of people are curious about how Crusoe works.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bates and the site's other editors have posted dozens of stories chronicling each twist and turn in Transmeta's development, analyzing the company's patents for clues and posting articles with such titles as ''Another Peep From Transmeta.'' Readers have responded with thousands of messages.</p>
        <p>Before January, rumors on Slashdot had Transmeta collaborating with the National Security Agency (not true), devising new uses for Linux (true), and plotting the destruction of the world (not true).</p>
        <p>''The question was, what has Linus Torvalds been working on in the lab for all these years?'' said Charles Rutstein, an analyst at the consulting firm Forrester Research. ''Now that's been answered and people are waiting for proof. Show me the devices.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rutstein, who sees the merits of the company's technology, expects the next step will be a ''major manufacturer signing with them and saying, 'We're going to produce millions of devices with Transmeta chips.' ''</p>
        <p>For now, though, Alexander Cheung, manager of the hedge fund Long Bow Capital Partners, believes a recent deal by Sony to use Transmeta chips in some laptops will be news enough to drive a lofty offering.</p>
        <p>''That's what I.P.O.s are all about,'' he added. ''People looking for a ray of hope.''</p>
