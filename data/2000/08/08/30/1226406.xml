        <p>Vinny Testaverde leans back in a chair, easily crossing the legs that are more closely scrutinized than the Rockettes'.</p>
        <p>It is a week before the Jets' regular season begins at Green Bay on Sunday, and Testaverde responds to questions about his Achilles' tendon and big toe with confidence brimming so fully that he pounces on speculation about his health with all the momentum of Venus Williams closing fast on a floating drop shot.</p>
        <p>Worried about the toe?</p>
        <p>''Never did,'' he said. ''To be successful in this league you have to play hurt. All the little injuries, the less serious ones, if you can't play with those type of injuries you can't play in the National Football League.''</p>
        <p>Testaverde has taken a grueling road back to this level of conviction from the season-ending Achilles' injury he sustained in the opening game last season. It is a quality the Jets will immediately have to rely on after an off-season of tumult.</p>
        <p>Testaverde took fewer than 50 snaps during the preseason, and he has not played since Aug. 12, so he has not completely shorn the rust that still mottles him.</p>
        <p>His goal was not merely to play again, but to return to his level of play in 1998, when he threw for 29 touchdowns and seven interceptions in leading the Jets to the brink of the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>Even though Testaverde moved smoothly and threw strongly in his limited action this preseason, his numbers were unimpressive: 11 of 21 passing for 244 yards, with two interceptions -- both for touchdowns.</p>
        <p>He admits that he does not know how he will perform during the first games. A slow start in September would not be unexpected, especially since Testaverde is learning to live without Keyshawn Johnson and with new receivers like Vincent Brisby and Laveranues Coles.</p>
        <p>But Coach Al Groh is so sure of Testaverde's readiness that he said he had not given Testaverde's health much thought after watching him run last week in practice.</p>
        <p>Testaverde said he never had a doubt about attempting a comeback from the Achilles' injury, even when he could have wondered what he would return to. Bill Parcells was going to the front office and Johnson was going to Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>Testaverde spent six to eight hours a day rehabilitating the Achilles' with a dizzying prescription of whirlpool therapies, massages, stretches and balance exercises.</p>
        <p>His mind was addled by the tedium and his body -- bereft of any aerobic work -- was soft. He felt lousy, even though he was never in pain. And when he could finally start lifting weights and running again, his body was sore every day and he was slow.  ''I went through this period when I thought, 'This is impossible,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>At the eight-month mark in his rehabilitation, Testaverde felt his explosiveness returning, but that accomplishment was overwhelmed that day by the concern that once the first hits from another team came, he might be able to go no further.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know,'' Testaverde said. ''Can somebody land on the back of my foot and everything be O.K.? You don't know.''</p>
        <p>When Dan Marino ruptured his Achilles' tendon in 1993, Testaverde was on the sideline with Cleveland. That was as much as Testaverde knew about such an injury until he found himself in the training room last year, hearing the whispers that Marino, who was hurt at age 32, was never the same afterward. Testaverde's ignorance was his shield.</p>
        <p>''A ruptured Achilles'; it doesn't sound like much,'' Testaverde said. ''Once it's you in that situation, you realize the severity of it. During training camp I went out to dinner and a man came over. He said, 'The same day you did yours, I did mine.' He was in the Marines. He can no longer perform his duties, so he's working in a restaurant. I think about him; I think about me. He can't perform his duties for his country because of that. Can I come back?''</p>
        <p>Whatever doubts Testaverde harbored were exacerbated by the constant irritation at the mention of his age. He will turn 37 during the season, a point that has buzzed about him like a persistent fly.</p>
        <p>The backup quarterback, Ray Lucas, and running back Curtis Martin think Testaverde is stronger now than before, because his arm and legs are well-rested from the layoff. With each day of practice, Lucas said, Testaverde's throws grew crisper, his decisions grew faster. The game, as Testaverde put it, slowed down in his mind's eye.</p>
        <p>He has stopped thinking about the heel and he has shelved thoughts of retirement. Those were born of his own fears, which he has allayed. With opening day upon him, Testaverde said he is exhilarated.</p>
        <p>The critical test of his confidence came in a preseason game against the Baltimore Ravens, when the 330-pound defensive lineman Sam Adams grasped Testaverde from behind by his ankles and pulled him to the ground. Adams landed on the back of Testaverde's left heel, driving his big toe into the ground. The Jets were anxious when Testaverde got up limping, but Testaverde had a glass-half-full view of the injury.</p>
        <p>''I didn't think about the heel when I got hurt,'' he said. ''All I could think about was the shooting pain in my toe. Which was good. I'm confident in everything now, mentally and physically. Throwing the football, taking off running, having that feeling of dropping back in the pocket and taking a hit if I have to.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Jets' 53-man roster was shaken up yesterday, when the team, as expected, signed its third long snapper in four days. The Jets replaced JOHN HUDSON -- the long snapper for one day after DENNIS O'SULLIVAN was cut Saturday -- with BRAD BANTA, who was waived by Indianapolis. . . . The Jets also cut three players: the kick returner and wide receiver DWIGHT STONE, linebacker J. J. SYVRUD  and cornerback DEL LEE. Stone was a 14-year veteran who was second in the conference in kickoff returns last season with a 24.6-yard average on 26 returns. But as a receiver, he had only two catches over the last five seasons. His departure means the rookie LAVERANUES COLES will be paired with AARON GLENN on returns this season. . . . Syvrud was re-signed to the practice squad after clearing waivers, along with four players whom the Jets cut Saturday: receiver YATIL GREEN, tackle JEFF PILON, running back VAUGHN SANDERS and defensive end JON MICHALS. The Jets also claimed three players off waivers: cornerback EARTHWIND MORELAND, offensive tackle CORNELL GREEN and defensive tackle MAURICE ANDERSON.</p>
