        <p>This week President Clinton went to Arusha, Tanzania, hoping to witness the signing of a peace agreement ending the genocidal war in Burundi.

        <p>This week President Clinton went to Arusha, Tanzania, hoping to witness the signing of a peace agreement ending the genocidal war in Burundi. All too predictably -- and despite the tireless efforts of Nelson Mandela as a mediator -- the only agreement that Burundi's Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups could agree on was essentially meaningless, failing to provide for any genuine sharing of power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's public support for Mr. Mandela's unenviable task in Burundi is a wasted symbolic gesture, squandering the prestige of the United States, just as the mediation effort itself squanders Mr. Mandela's mythic abilities. Both men should realize that a democratic renewal of central Africa is not possible unless the Hutu-Tutsi problem is resolved.</p>
        <p>The boilerplate approach to diplomacy in civil conflicts -- an emphasis on power sharing between hostile groups and a transition to real democracy -- is hopeless in this case.  Rather than trying to force the Hutu and the Tutsi to live together, Mr. Mandela ought to openly voice the belief of most ordinary Africans: that peace cannot come to Burundi or neighboring Rwanda unless the Hutu and Tutsi are separated by an international border.</p>
        <p>Burundi and Rwanda are dysfunctional states created by old colonial borders. The Tutsi, who constitute only 15 percent of the population in both countries but control the governments and the armies, will absolutely not permit genuine democracy because the Hutu, with their 85 per cent majorities, would dominate any free and fair elections. Burundi's flirtation with experimental democracy in 1993 ended when the Tutsi-dominated military overthrew and killed the Hutu president after he had been in office five months. In Rwanda, the first-ever Hutu government carried out the orchestrated genocide of 1994, in which over half a million Tutsi were killed.</p>
        <p>Nor would power-sharing arrangements, or giving the Hutu some sort of autonomy within each country, be realistic. The Tutsi governments have vowed that they will never give up any part of the state or allow a Hutu majority in the army. Hutu and Tutsi in both countries see the exclusive control of the state as an essential precondition to their survival as a people.</p>
        <p>Redrawing the map of central Africa may seem radical, but consider what has happened elsewhere since the end of the cold war. The Soviet Union was broken up largely along ethnic and cultural lines (the war in Chechnya is an example of what can happen when non-Russian people are kept under Moscow's rule). The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia have been quelled only when lines have been drawn to divide ethnic groups or armed troops keep the peace.</p>
        <p>Just like Kosovar Albanians and Serbs, the Tutsi and the Hutu cannot live together or tolerate each other. The differences between the two groups are not linguistic, cultural or racial; the division is simply about power. Over the centuries, caste and status solidified identities, with the Tutsi emerging as rulers. Belgian colonial rule further entrenched and distorted Tutsi domination, creating the ineradicable hatreds that have exploded in the last decade into gruesome atrocities.</p>
        <p>Now all of Central Africa is affected. Since 1998, troops from Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi have supported an insurgency to overthrow President Laurent Kabila of Congo largely because of his failure to curb attacks on the Rwandan government by Hutu operating out of eastern Congo. Zimbabwe, Namibia, Chad and Angola have sent troops into Congo to support Mr. Kabila.</p>
        <p>A real solution to the Hutu-Tutsi conflict -- and the Congo war -- would be for a United Nations panel to redraw the maps of Burundi and Rwanda to create two wholly new states: one for the Hutu, the other for the Tutsi. Mr. Mandela's imprimatur on such a proposal would instantly legitimize it in Africa -- and within the Clinton administration. The logistics of such a plan may seem daunting, but in the end it would be far better to conduct large population transfers now than to accept genocide every few years.</p>
