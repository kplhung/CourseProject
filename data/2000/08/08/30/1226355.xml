        <p>OM Gruppen A.B., the owner of the Stockholm stock exchange, began a $1.2 billion hostile bid today for the much bigger London Stock Exchange, touching off the first takeover fight for an exchange.</p>
        <p>Hours after the Swedish exchange announced its cash-and-stock offer, the London exchange -- which is seven times the size of the Swedish one -- postponed indefinitely its Sept. 14 shareholder vote on its planned merger with the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt.</p>
        <p>And, adding to the tumult, Rolf Breuer, the chairman of the Deutsche Borse, said in an interview with The International Herald-Tribune that the exchange was prepared to consider changing its agreement with the London exchange into ''a friendly takeover'' instead of a merger. Deutsche Borse, however, would take its cue from London on whether to proceed with a sweetened offer, people close to those discussions said.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Frankfurt exchange said that it had no plans to enter a bidding war. But officials there said it was unclear whether other contenders -- like the Euronext alliance of the Paris, Belgian and Dutch exchanges -- would also consider an offer.</p>
        <p>''If the debate would reopen, we would be very interested to enter the debate,'' said Vincent Van Dessel, general manager of the Brussels exchange. ''But I am not sure an offer is something we can envisage.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome, the fate of the 200-year-old London exchange, and its control of the world's oldest and Europe's biggest securities market, will most likely be tied more closely to one or more European exchanges, which are trying to devise new ways to trade across borders.</p>
        <p>''We'll end up in bed with the Germans or we'll succumb to the Swedes,'' said Richard Grossman, a director of Redmayne Bentley Stockbrokers, which is a shareholder in the London exchange. ''London is bound to lose its independence.''</p>
        <p>In reality, London is dominated by the trading floors of big American banks, which in the past have supported the idea of a London-Frankfurt merger because of the trading volumes and increased liquidity it would yield. ''It's important to have the volume and that's what London-Frankfurt has got,'' one executive said.</p>
        <p>A combined London-Frankfurt exchange would be known as iX and would trade securities with a combined market value of $4.3 trillion, compared with Stockholm's $330 billion. London alone trades $2.8 trillion in stocks, compared with more than $11 trillion on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Today's developments come after two years of muddled efforts by European exchanges to meet investors' demands for a single market after the introduction of the European single currency, the euro, and to confront a challenge from cheaper and more nimble Internet-based stock-trading networks.</p>
        <p>Those trends have increased pressure on exchanges like London's to issue their own shares to speed consolidation. But today's hostile bid highlighted the risk of going public in a market as balkanized as Europe's and as vulnerable to predators. The London-Frankfurt merger is supposed to be a precursor to an alliance with the Nasdaq stock market, offering 24-hour global trading in high-growth stocks. That deal would collapse if the London-Frankfurt merger falls apart.</p>
        <p>Nasdaq said today that it was ''committed to the iX venture, with its economies of scale and its vision for a global market partnership.'' However, its chairman, Frank G. Zarb, said recently that ''Nasdaq will be in Europe one way or another,'' implying that the exchange could consider other options.</p>
        <p>OM began its hostile bid after officials at the London exchange rejected an initial overture last Friday, saying they were dissatisfied with the amount of detail OM had provided, according to executives close to the discussions.</p>
        <p>Today, OM offered stockholders in the London exchange 7 [pounds] in cash and 0.65 of a new OM share, valuing each share of the London exchange at $:27.19, or $40, 16 percent more than Friday's closing price. The London exchange called the offer ''derisory'' and urged its shareholders to take no action. OM has 28 days to publish its offer.</p>
        <p>OM said its offer was conditional on 90 percent approval by London exchange shareholders -- a threshold that might prove difficult to reach, according to traders in London and Frankfurt. The London-Frankfurt deal would have required 75 percent approval at the Sept. 14 meeting, now postponed.</p>
        <p>The OM move came after shareholders in the London exchange, most of them relatively small traders, had already signaled their unhappiness with the London-Frankfurt deal, arguing that there was insufficient detail on issues like cost, regulation, clearing and settling to evaluate it.</p>
        <p>''It was imperative that there was a delay in voting,'' said Brian Mairs, a spokesman for an industry group representing private client and other noninstitutional traders, which account for one-third of the shares in the London exchange.</p>
        <p>''It has to offer the same benefits to us as to the big players,'' he said, referring to the big banks operating in London, which have generally remained silent on the OM bid despite the sense among some of them that, in the words of one executive, ''the reality is that iX has a lot more support out of the public eye.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, some analysts said, the uncertainties surrounding the Sept. 14 vote probably encouraged OM to make its bid, possibly to thwart the creation of a European giant or to hobble the London-Frankfurt merger while OM rolls out the Jiway pan-European electronic trading platform that it is developing with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.</p>
        <p>But the OM bid drew criticism from shareholders like Guinness Peat, a finance group that owns about 1 percent of the London exchange, which called the Swedish offer ''pretty unappealing'' because it undervalued the London exchange.</p>
        <p>Other investors have complained that OM's bid is based on overvalued OM stock.</p>
        <p>OM, which is using its status as a leading supplier of market technology to support its bid, went on the offensive today to promote its bid, calling it ''a perfect match.''</p>
        <p>''L.S.E. would keep its strong position, with OM, a leading technological supplier, at its side; it's a very serious alternative to iX,'' said Olof Stenhammar, OM's chairman.</p>
        <p>''We believe that the proposed iX merger squanders the potential of L.S.E. and that with our proven management skills and leading technology, we can secure L.S.E.'s position as the pre-eminent European stock exchange,'' he added.</p>
