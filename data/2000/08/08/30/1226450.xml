        <p>Maqbool Ahmed has dreams of instant wealth, which ordinarily would require a mighty burst of imagination from a man living in the Bombay slum of Geeta Nagar, a hideous warren of hovels where the air reeks of kerosene and fish, and there are only 24 toilets for 6,000 people.</p>
        <p>But come 9 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays, Mr. Ahmed, like virtually everyone else in this monsoon-swamped ghetto, ignores the leaky roof, turns on a cheap black-and-white television and watches the Indian version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>''Even I know Josip Broz Tito was not the leader of Egypt,'' Mr. Ahmed said confidently last night, harrumphing at a confused contestant named Ravi who must have slept through the cold war and was now using a valuable ''lifeline'' to phone his friend Murli for help. ''The correct answer is Yugoslavia.''</p>
        <p>Since early July, India -- a nation where the average person would need 2,325 years of income to become a millionaire -- has been obsessed with ''Kaun Banega Crorepati,'' or literally ''Who Will Become a Ten-Millionaire,'' the Indian version of the game show created in Britain and now exported to 31 countries including the United States, Japan, Israel, Finland and Argentina.</p>
        <p>East is East and West is West, and this is where the twain have met.</p>
        <p>''Everyone understands the language of money,'' said Mr. Ahmed, 41, who peddles envelopes from a pushcart for a living. The show is simple to follow. I am not so smart, and I know many of the answers. Maybe I will be a millionaire.''</p>
        <p>The show is unusual here because of its extravagant production quality and the large jackpot. Crore is a number meaning 10 million. A crorepati, then, is actually someone with 10 million rupees -- about $222,000 at current exchange rates.</p>
        <p>Ratings are as yet an inexact science in India, but by some counts ''Crorepati'' is being watched nightly by more than 100 million people. In a single leap it took Star TV, owned by Rupert Murdoch, from the No. 3 to the No. 1 spot among the nation's cable channels.</p>
        <p>This can be a tough country for television. In 1965, when in America Ozzie and Harriet were starting their last season, there were fewer than 1,000 television sets in all of India. Even today, only about one-third of the households have televisions -- and less than half of those are set up for cable or satellite reception.</p>
        <p>India's population has topped one billion, but the country is a polyglot of 17 major languages. Most people in Calcutta do not know what the people in Madras are saying.</p>
        <p>''Wheel of Fortune'' was tried without much success. ''India has no national language and has a low level of literacy,'' said Amit Khanna, a television executive. ''This is not a place for a game like that, based on wordplay.''</p>
        <p>''Crorepati'' is in Hindi, with English thrown in here and there. Its popularity is highest in the so-called Hindi Belt in the north.</p>
        <p>The show's host is Amitabh Bachchan, a legendary leading man in Indian films and now a suave graybeard at 58. His movie career hit the skids, and ''Crorepati'' has become his resurrection. Contestants occasionally kiss his feet. Fan letters sometimes come written in blood.</p>
        <p>''I was apprehensive about whether I could deliver the goods,'' Mr. Bachchan said in an interview, relaxing in an apartment built for him near the stage set. It is modeled after a Swiss chalet. ''In films, people always put words in my mouth. Here it is a very ad hoc, ad lib kind of atmosphere.''</p>
        <p>Like Regis Philbin, he has become famous for this litany: ''Are you sure? Confident? Is that your final answer?'' It is presumed here that this is a Bachchan touch, part of his pose as a philosopher-guide.</p>
        <p>But the ''Millionaire'' format, as created by the British production company Celador, is highly scripted. It is the fast-food chain of quiz shows.</p>
        <p>The patter is precisely pat. The look of each set is identical. A computer program synchronizes the music and lighting. British technicians train the local crews. ''They send us a production bible, about 300 pages,'' said Ravinath Menon, executive producer of ''Crorepati.''</p>
        <p>''It's all a formula,'' he said. ''Our idea was not to reinvent the show, but to duplicate the show.''</p>
        <p>While the Indian masses are wild about the program, some of the intelligentsia have been sniffy. P. C. Joshi, a retired academic, said he refused to watch the program but had an ''instinctive revulsion'' to it.</p>
        <p>In 1985 Mr. Joshi headed a national commission that warned that careful controls must be maintained on television programming or Indian culture would be befouled. But such taint came to seem inevitable in the early 90's when Western tastes began to invade the airwaves via satellite. Shows like ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' were decried for licentious plots dependent on bed-hopping.</p>
        <p>In time, local producers developed their own soap operas rich with sexual escapades. It turned out that most people here did not object to shows that depicted adultery, as long as the adults involved were Indians.</p>
        <p>''Crorepati,'' despite its Western roots, is not seen as an invasion. ''Money is money, finally, and I think Indians just adore it and always have,'' said a cultural critic, Shanta Gokhale. ''We're inveterate gamblers.'' Rival networks have similar game shows in the works.</p>
        <p>But being on the show would seem to require far more luck than is common in Geeta Nagar. People from there do call in, trying to register their names. For them it is like buying a lottery ticket: an expensive fantasy. Use of a public phone costs about 50 cents, for many almost an entire day's pay.</p>
        <p>Besides, few Muslims, or Hindus from the lower castes, have made it onto the show. Those chosen are mostly professionals from big cities.</p>
        <p>''Only the bureaucrats seem to get to compete,'' Mr. Ahmed said haplessly.</p>
