        <p>Deutsche Telekom A.G., which bid $7.6 billion for a license to offer advance wireless services in Germany, acknowledged today that its profits will be depressed this year as a result of costs in its mobile telephone business. Reporting on half-year results today, the company reported a big jump in net income but one that was caused in large part by special one-time gains like the sale of its stake in Global One. Revenues from its traditional fixed-line telephone business declined almost 13 percent as a result of new competition and sinking prices. Company executives said the mobile business had experienced high costs in recruiting customers and must rapidly begin building new third-generation networks that are expected to transmit data and even video at high speeds.</p>
