        <p>The longer Roy Jones Jr. boxes, the more comfortable he feels with his career, and his accomplishments.</p>
        <p>Jones, the undisputed light-heavyweight champion (42-1, 34 knockouts), was in Manhattan yesterday to promote his next fight, a 12-round championship pay-per-view contest against Eric Harding (19-0-1), Sept. 9 at the New Orleans Arena. For Jones, the bout looks like another mismatch, a showcase for his immense skills, fighting an opponent who will enter the ring as a heavy underdog.</p>
        <p>Jones, regarded by many as the world's best boxer, has speed, power, and showmanship that bring electricity to all of his fights. Yet, at age 31, Jones has won so many fights so handily, he has begun to search outside his weight class for an opponent who will provide the defining challenge of his career. His only loss was a controversial disqualification against Montell Griffin in 1997, when Jones knocked out Griffin when he was down on one knee. Yet, Jones avenged that loss immediately with a first-round knockout of Griffin in his next fight.</p>
        <p>Jones talks about moving down in weight to fight the unbeaten Felix Trinidad, or perhaps moving up for a one-time heavyweight challenge against either Evander Holyfield or Lennox Lewis. But even if a marquee event like that never happens for Jones, he insists that he will remain very secure about his place in boxing.</p>
        <p>''I would love to see a big fight like that take place, like with Trinidad, but we're talking one or two years down the road,'' Jones said. ''I can't plan on that. What if he loses to Fernando Vargas before then?</p>
        <p>''As for fighting a heavyweight, I would do it one time only, to try and win the championship. I don't want to be a heavyweight. I'm not that desperate for a big fight. When I was supposed to have big fights in the past, I walked through them. James Toney was supposed to be a big fight, but I dominated. Bernard Hopkins hasn't lost since I beat him, but I beat him with one hand. If someone comes to me with a big fight like Felix Trinidad and we can agree to it, I'm cool with that. But at this point, I don't have to prove anything.''</p>
        <p>Jones is coming off an 11th-round technical knockout of Richard Hall in May, a fight Jones dominated from start to finish. Meanwhile, Jones has been negotiating with HBO for months regarding a new contract, but so far, an agreement has not been reached. Asked if he would re-sign with HBO, Jones was noncommittal. Jones also manages nine or 10 fighters, and he feels committed to look after their careers and his own.</p>
        <p>''I never said it was a bad relationship with HBO, but I've got about five or six more years in this game, and I need to capitalize on that,'' Jones said. ''This might be the last contract that I negotiate as a professional athlete. I want to have a place where I can bring my fighters. After the position I've established in this game, I shouldn't have to beg for that.''</p>
        <p>Seth Abraham, the president of Time Warner Sports, sounded optimistic that a contract agreement with Jones would eventually be reached.</p>
        <p>''We've left a deal on the table since December,'' Abraham said. ''Roy has never accepted that deal, but we've left it there out of respect for Roy. Roy is an icon. The deal will get done, or not get done, when Roy is ready. After the Harding fight, he is a free agent. But there's no better place than HBO, and we hope to sign him. I still believe Roy is the best fighter in the world. Other fighters have risen in the last year -- Felix Trinidad, Shane Mosley. But I still think Roy stands alone.''</p>
        <p>And after the Harding fight, Jones still expects to be in a class by himself.</p>
        <p>''He might try to hurt me, but if I was him, I wouldn't try to do that,'' Jones said. ''When I get hurt, I only get stronger.''</p>
