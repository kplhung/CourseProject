        <p>The poor of South Africa made their way from remote farms and rural villages last month to testify before the government hearings around the country. And in their painstaking accounts of modern-day wrongs, there rang disturbing echoes of this country's ugly history.</p>
        <p>In Coligny, black patients spoke of doctors who still keep segregated waiting rooms. In Orkney, police officers complained about supervisors who bar blacks from sharing toilets or spoons with white colleagues. And in Bloemfontein, black students described how white classmates hurled condoms filled with water at them.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, this country's simmering anxieties over racism have flared as President Thabo Mbeki and Tony Leon, the leader of the predominantly white opposition, have exchanged bitter words, and the president has publicly accused Mr. Leon of being a racist.</p>
        <p>South Africa is preparing to hold a national conference on racism this week, and the testimony from the hearings offers an intimate look into how racism still touches lives beyond the headlines and political squabbles.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of black people testified, with most complaining about racial slurs and discrimination in hiring and promotions.</p>
        <p>But in rural provinces, a troubling number also described vicious hate crimes and places where the rules of apartheid seemingly remain unchanged.</p>
        <p>The hearings were in preparation for the conference, which is to be opened by President Mbeki on Wed nesday, in the hope that a public airing of the problems will unite the country in a battle against hate.</p>
        <p>''We have spoken about reconciliation and we have spoken about nation-building, but we have never as a nation spoken about confronting our racist past and how we move forward and deal with racism,'' said Pansy Tlakula, a member of the Human Rights Commission, which is coordinating the conference.</p>
        <p>But talk at the conference has inevitably highlighted the divisions in this racially polarized society. The conference has been welcomed by some and disparaged by others, with supporters and naysayers falling on predictable sides of the color line.</p>
        <p>Of the hundreds who attended the public hearings, only a handful were white. The rights commission is often dismissed by whites as being biased against them.</p>
        <p>Members of the Mine Workers Union, which represents 65,000 Afrikaners in mining, telecommunications and electrical engineering, plan to picket the conference, saying it fails to address the racism that white employees now experience in the workplace.</p>
        <p>While Vusi Mona, a columnist for The City Press who is black, praised the conference as an ''opportunity to deal with racism candidly,'' Solomon Jacobovsky described it in a letter to the editor published today in The Citizen as a waste of precious taxpayer dollars. ''What, if anything, have these undertakings achieved?'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>There is certainly no indication that the conference will ease tensions between the leading politicians.</p>
        <p>Last month Mr. Leon denounced Mr. Mbeki's insistence on searching for African solutions to the AIDS epidemic, saying his efforts represented little more than ''snake-oil cures and quackery.''</p>
        <p>The president responded by attacking Mr. Leon as ''willing to enunciate an entrenched white racism that is a millennium old.''</p>
        <p>''According to him, a politician who practices his craft on the African continent, these solutions, because they are African, could not but consist of the pagan, savage, superstitious and unscientific responses,'' said Mr. Mbeki, who is financing local scientists in their search for an AIDS vaccine but who has been criticized for embracing theories about AIDS disparaged by most scientists.</p>
        <p>Politicians and academics have urged the two men to stop their quarrel and to find common ground. And while there has been no hint that tensions between them are easing, the public hearings did offer tentative signs of hope.</p>
        <p>Jan Nel, one of the few whites to testify, said he was pleased that his children were growing up in an integrated world. And Tlotlo Mokoke, a 9-year-old schoolboy, testified that in his class white children and black children share food and toys.</p>
        <p>Graeme Simpson, the executive director of the Center for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, said the conference was a good idea, although he was doubtful that it would have much influence on the lives of ordinary people.</p>
        <p>''There's a real risk that it stays quite a lot of hot air for most people,'' he added. ''But at the same time, it's an absolutely central issue. It's very obvious that racism is alive and well.''</p>
