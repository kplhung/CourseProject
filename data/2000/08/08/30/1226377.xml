        <p>Even as it seeks to complete the official population count for 2000, the Census Bureau finds itself engaged in a battle with House Republicans over how the bureau is conducting its head count.</p>
        <p>Throughout the summer, members of the House Subcommittee on the Census and their staffs have demanded explanations from the Census Bureau about its counting methods. House Republicans have also been quick to call for investigations when they believed the bureau was withholding information or failing to make an attempt to count everyone.</p>
        <p>Republicans say their activities are routine efforts at Congressional monitoring, while Democrats suspect the Republicans are laying the groundwork for later legal attacks on the accuracy of the census.</p>
        <p>''The bureau has $6.5 billion that it is spending on this census,'' Chip Walker, the subcommittee's assistant staff director, said in explaining the panel's scrutiny of the Census Bureau's operations.</p>
        <p>''We have taken a different approach than the Democrats on the subcommittee. The Democrats have taken a hands-off approach. They are willing to let the bureau spend the $6.5 billion as it sees fit. We don't believe that approach fulfills our oversight responsibilities.''</p>
        <p>Democrats say the Republicans seek to portray the bureau as incapable of carrying out routine tasks, let alone a complex operation like statistical sampling, an additional measure opposed by Republicans that is to supplement the actual count.</p>
        <p>Even if the subcommittee staff does not turn up systemic wrongdoing on the bureau's part, its constant questioning may raise doubts about the bureau's methods.</p>
        <p>Such doubts may be useful in what is expected to be a protracted legal battle over whether population data compiled using sampling can be used in redistricting, the drawing of lines for Congressional and state legislative districts.</p>
        <p>''It lays the groundwork for the legal action that will probably take up the first half of the next decade,'' said one Republican strategist. ''Both parties view the stakes of redistricting very high. So on the Republican side, the strategy has shifted from fighting the theory of sampling to fighting the mechanics of it.''</p>
        <p>The bureau is gathering demographic data from a sample of 314,000 households and will use that to adjust population counts in areas as small as a city block. It is using this method, which is nearly completed, to adjust for the millions of residents it expects to miss using the traditional counting methods.</p>
        <p>Republicans have opposed the sampling method -- and Democrats have supported it -- in large part because many of the people who are missed tend to be members of minority groups living in traditionally Democratic areas.</p>
        <p>Political strategists believe adjustments using the sampling data would give Democrats an advantage when legislative boundaries are drawn.</p>
        <p>Earlier this summer, the House Census subcommittee staff charged that the bureau completed its work too quickly in 15 cities, including Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, Newark, Philadelphia and New York.</p>
        <p>The Republicans based their suspicions about wider problems on the discovery in June by federal auditors of wrongdoing by census takers in Hialeah, Fla.</p>
        <p>There, the auditors found that census takers had stopped visiting households that had failed to send back their questionnaires after only one unsuccessful attempt, rather than after the mandatory six tries; in some cases, the auditors found, the census takers had simply made up the answers.</p>
        <p>As a result, the bureau sent census takers to reinterview the residents of all households in Hialeah that had not mailed back their forms.</p>
        <p>After an internal investigation, Kenneth W. Prewitt, director of the Census Bureau, said last month that he had not found any problems in the 15 local census offices named by the subcommittee staff.</p>
        <p>Still, the Republicans have demanded that the bureau save more than 30 million forms that have been completed by census takers across the country who conducted interviews in households that did not mail back their census questionnaires.</p>
        <p>Normally, these forms are destroyed after the data they contain is scanned into the Census Bureau's computers. But the Republicans say they want the forms saved to make sure that the information inserted into the computers is accurate.</p>
        <p>Bureau officials said today that holding the forms would mean $3.5 million to $5 million just in storage costs.</p>
        <p>''If the United States Congress wants to pay $5 million to store these things in a warehouse for 10 years, we'll cooperate,'' Mr. Prewitt said.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Representative Dan Miller, a Florida Republican who chairs the subcommittee, called for a Justice Department investigation into the bureau's participation in a political and cultural symposium held in Los Angeles by Tavis Smiley, a black radio and television personality two days before the Democratic National Convention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller said that because the symposium was listed by the Democratic National Committee as an event taking place in Los Angeles around the time of the convention, it was a partisan event and that the bureau should not have taken part.</p>
        <p>In a release, Mr. Miller said that the event cast a ''dark cloud'' over the census.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smiley, who has worked closely with the Census Bureau for more than a year trying to increase the response rate of black households mailing back their census forms, has hotly denied any link between his symposium and the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>He said that three Census Bureau workers merely set up a table at the event and handed out information on the census.</p>
        <p>''It was in no way connected to the D.N.C.'' Mr. Smiley said today. ''The D.N.C. gave me no money, there was no speaker from the D.N.C. The Census Bureau gave me no money.''</p>
