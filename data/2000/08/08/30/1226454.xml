        <p>Cautioning that election-year politics should not be allowed to overshadow New Jersey's pressing public policy issues, Gov.

        <p>Cautioning that election-year politics should not be allowed to overshadow New Jersey's pressing public policy issues, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman challenged legislators today to enact modest increases in financing for several health care programs and to tighten campaign finance restrictions when they begin their fall session next week.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters at a briefing in the State House, the governor unveiled her legislative wish list for the fall: an additional $25 million to expand the state's prescription drug plan for the elderly; $17 million to allow more low-income families to qualify for the Family Care health insurance program; and at least $10 million to increase the amount the state reimburses doctors who treat Medicaid patients.</p>
        <p>In a proposal that may encounter opposition from legislators, Mrs. Whitman also offered campaign finance restrictions that would force all advocacy groups that advertise for or against candidates to identify their members and donors.</p>
        <p>During her seven years as governor, Mrs. Whitman has made it a ritual to publicly release her legislative priorities in January, when she delivers her State of the State Message and makes budget proposals. But the governor, who must step down in January 2002 because of term limits, said she broke with tradition this year because she did not want the presidential race, or the political jousting between the legislators who hope to succeed her, to unduly dominate the state's agenda.</p>
        <p>''Even though it's a big election-cycle year, there's time to get some of these issues out of the way,'' Mrs. Whitman said.</p>
        <p>With just 16 months remaining in her term, Mrs. Whitman said she was determined to strengthen some of the policies she has championed since taking office in 1994. She asked that the Family Care program, which was enacted last year to help low-income residents afford health care, receive additional financing to allow all families with an income of up to $10,000 to qualify. The governor said it was crucial to raise the cutoff limit from its current level of $8,000 because many of the people who have left the state's welfare rolls in recent years do not qualify for coverage now and have less incentive to remain in the work force.</p>
        <p>''We're so focused on welfare-to-work and making it work,'' she said. ''We need to remove barriers.''</p>
        <p>But the two leaders of the Legislature -- Donald T. DiFrancesco, the Senate president, and Jack Collins, the Assembly speaker -- are both vying for the Republican nomination for governor in 2001, and Mrs. Whitman acknowledged that they are likely to exert more power over the legislative agenda during the next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiFrancesco, for instance, recently announced a proposal for property tax relief and is scheduled to release a health care package on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman said she was pleased with much of Mr. DiFrancesco's plan, especially a provision that would allow patients to sue health maintenance organizations if they receive substandard care.</p>
        <p>She said she would also ask legislators to form a panel to help patients through the complex process of challenging decisions by H.M.O.'s.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman said she hoped that the election year would help marshal public support for her campaign finance proposals, which would require more public disclosure by donors and advocacy groups and eliminate the state's matching funds for contributions from out-of-state sources. But the governor did not push for some of the more sweeping proposals to overhaul the state's campaign finance laws, like limiting expenditures in local races or reducing the $30,000 donation limits to political action committees controlled by New Jersey legislative leaders.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman said she saw some merit in those suggestions, but did not include them because they would probably doom her bill's chances of winning legislative approval.</p>
        <p>''I want to break through here,'' she said. ''I want to be sure we get something done.''</p>
        <p>The governor also proposed tightening regulations for home repair contractors, some of whom have swindled elderly homeowners with shoddy workmanship. The governor's plan would force all contractors to register with the state and would impose stiffer penalties on those found guilty of defrauding homeowners.</p>
