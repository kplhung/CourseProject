        <p>Even if President Clinton lied under oath to a federal judge about his relationship with a White House intern, disbarment would be too strong a penalty, the president's lawyers said in court papers today.</p>
        <p>Their statement, filed with the Pulaski County Superior Court in Arkansas, was in response to a recommendation by a disciplinary committee that he be stripped of his law license because of ''serious misconduct.'' The committee has said he gave false testimony in 1998 about his relationship with the intern, Monica Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>In their statement, Mr. Clinton's lawyers noted that the president still disputed that his testimony was technically false. But even if the allegation were correct, the lawyers said,  ''a sanction of disbarment would be excessively harsh, impermissibly punitive and unprecedented in the circumstances of this case.''</p>
        <p>The president's lawyers, David E. Kendall and Nicole K. Seligman of Washington, said in the filing that Mr. Clinton's alleged offense was not connected to the practice of law nor was he convicted of -- or even charged with -- a felony. In Arkansas, they said, disbarment has never been imposed in a case that did not involve a felony conviction or a matter involving the practice of law.</p>
        <p>A trial on the disbarment issue could occur sometime this fall. In any event, Judge Leon Johnson, who is presiding over the case, has indicated that he expects to conclude the proceedings by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The disciplinary case involves Mr. Clinton's statements under oath on Jan. 17, 1998, when he gave a deposition in the sexual misconduct lawsuit brought against him by Paula Corbin Jones.</p>
        <p>In the presence of Judge Susan Webber Wright, a federal trial judge who was presiding over the civil lawsuit, Mr. Clinton said he had never engaged in a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and he denied that he had ever been alone with her but for a fleeting moment.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Clinton acknowledged in August 1998 that he had had an improper physical relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Judge Wright ruled that his behavior in the deposition constituted contempt of court.</p>
        <p>''The president,'' she said, ''deliberately violated this court's discovery orders, thereby undermining the integrity of the judicial system.'' She said that ''sanctions must be imposed to redress the president's misconduct and to deter others who might consider emulating the president's misconduct.''</p>
        <p>Judge Wright fined Mr. Clinton $1,202 to cover her costs in traveling to Washington to attend the deposition and ordered him to pay some $90,000 in fees to Ms. Jones's lawyers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has argued that his deposition testimony that he did not engage in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky was accurate because the oral sex in which they engaged did not fit the definition of sexual relations that had been approved by Judge Wright.</p>
