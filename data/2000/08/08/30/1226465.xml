      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A report in the Media Talk column in Business Day on Monday about an MSNBC billboard promoting ''The News With Brian Williams'' misstated a comparison between the average audience for the program's 9 p.m. showing and what MSNBC says was its cumulative audience during April. The average nightly audience of 203,000 is one-206th of the cumulative audience of 42 million, which includes the number of different viewers tuned in to at least one minute of any of its showings, including four repeats a night. It is not one-20,500th.</p>
