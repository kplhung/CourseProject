        <p>THE time has come to stock up on pens and notebooks and index cards. No, I don't mean back-to-school supplies. I mean back-to-work supplies.

        <p>THE time has come to stock up on pens and notebooks and index cards. No, I don't mean back-to-school supplies. I mean back-to-work supplies. My apologies to Julius Caesar and Dick Clark, but the real year -- the work year -- begins in September. Which means its just about time (don't panic, you have until next week) for our collective brains to click back into gear.</p>
        <p>Yes, this was a dud of a summer in New York -- wet and cold, and even the lifeguards never had a tan. Even so, it was summer.</p>
        <p>Years of conditioning, from grade school through grad school, have led us to expect that the summer should feel different, and because we expect it, it is so. We arrive at work later, leave earlier, take long weekends. Even rush hour comes at different times.</p>
        <p>Those responsible for our mental health set the pace and lead the way. I have just started work on a magazine article that requires interviewing a lot of psychiatrists, and although I placed calls to two dozen of them last week, I have yet to actually reach a single one.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, businesses are rearranging themselves around this ebb in the calendar. The owners of We Take the Cake, a mail-order bakery based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., analyzed their orders and saw a significant dip in the summer.</p>
        <p>''People are traveling, businesses don't have events going on,'' says Kathy Guerke, who owns the company with her husband, Andy. And then there's the added problem of customers who diet to fit into their swimsuits. This year the Guerkes closed shop completely for two weeks in July, leaving on vacation for the first time since they opened three years ago. (They took a busman's holiday to the South of France, where they ate a lot of desserts.)</p>
        <p>On their return, they cut back their hours, closing every day at 2 p.m. ''The summer schedule will probably last until November,'' said Ms. Guerke, who was just back from playing tennis at 3 o'clock one Monday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Susan Buckley is a senior vice president and partner of Empower Media Marketing, a marketing-services agency based in Cincinnati (where, by the way, the weather was beautiful this summer). Her company is too busy to shut down completely, she says, but has done other things to ''make it up to our employees'' who would really rather be outside. Every Wednesday from June through August there is a catered lunch out on the patio. Each Thursday a truck with a water tank comes to the parking lot and washes employees' cars, courtesy of the company. Fridays are half days, Ms. Buckley says, because very little work is done on Friday afternoons. ''Why bother making calls,'' she asks, ''when all you do is reach people's phone mail?''</p>
        <p>There are, of course, workers who beg to differ. ''I work harder in August than I do in September, that's for sure,'' said Len Ferber, co-chairman of the technology group at the law firm of Katten, Muchin &amp; Zavis in Chicago.</p>
        <p>He certainly sounds tired. ''If a client is going on vacation,'' he says, ''he's either going to give you a lot of work to finish by the time he leaves, so he can tell his boss, 'I got this done, I got that done,' or else he's going to give you a lot of work to finish while he's on vacation so it's ready when he gets back.''</p>
        <p>In a roundabout way, I'd argue, this proves my point. Mr. Ferber is working so hard this summer because his clients are not.</p>
        <p>Several years ago, I was writing a book proposal over the summer, and my agent was urging me to hurry so that she could send it to publishers come September. (I should note that these pep talks to write faster never came on Friday afternoons because she closed her office on Fridays during the summer.) September, she warned, was the only time anyone completed any real work in publishing. Come October, it seems, everyone is distracted by the Frankfurt book fair. In November, there's Thanksgiving, followed by a month of parties, meaning no one can concentrate until the New Year. The doldrums of January and February are, well, doldrums, interrupted by another booksellers convention, this one in London, in March. Then there's spring break -- planning for it, then recovering from it -- and before you can click on your Palm Pilot, it's Memorial Day.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to Labor Day, aptly named because we are about to embark on the only few productive weeks of the year. Now sharpen those No. 2 pencils. You're going back to work.</p>
