        <p>It looked very bad when Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez emerged from the clubhouse late Monday night flanked by trainers as he headed to a room for X-rays on his left foot.</p>
        <p>But at a time when the Yankees are increasingly hindered by injuries, they got some good news after their 9-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners. Martinez had not broken any bones sliding awkwardly in the eighth inning, but had merely hyperextended his foot.</p>
        <p>A throw beat Martinez to the plate, and Mariners catcher Dan Wilson extended his left leg, cutting off Martinez's lane to home plate; Martinez banged against Wilson's foot with his own feet.</p>
        <p>''I kind of bent my foot backward a little bit,'' Martinez said. ''It's sore. It's more the middle of my foot, the bridge of my foot.''</p>
        <p>''I'm sure I can play,'' Martinez continued, referring to tonight's game against the Mariners. ''But you know how Joe is.''</p>
        <p>Yankees Manager Joe Torre, whose priority these days seems to be keeping his players as healthy as possible as they go through the last weeks of the season and into the playoffs, planned to rest Martinez.</p>
        <p>Martinez joins some high-profile talent on the casualty list. Paul O'Neill, the right fielder, needed another day to allow a shot of cortisone to take effect on his right hip pointer.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch, the second baseman, did not play for the fourth consecutive day on his minor league rehabilitation assignment. Knoblauch, bothered by a sore elbow, was hit by a pitch on the left knee last Friday. Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, reiterated today his belief that Knoblauch would eventually come back to play second base -- although it may not be until next Monday, after Knoblauch plays for Class AAA Columbus for a few days.</p>
        <p>The reliever Ramiro Mendoza, on the disabled list because of weakness in the back of his right shoulder, is scheduled to throw batting practice to minor leaguers on Friday in Tampa, Fla.</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams, the center fielder, returned to the lineup full time on Monday. Outfielder David Justice is playing but is still bothered by a sore neck.</p>
