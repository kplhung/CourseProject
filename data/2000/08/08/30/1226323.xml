        <p>THE ROYAL FAMILY  By William T. Vollmann  780 pages. Viking. $40.</p>
        <p>The royal family of ''The Royal Family'' is a group of women from San Francisco who are in what is knowingly called ''the life'': the life of prostitution, mostly, but the attendant lives of drugs, bohemian despair and middle-class strivings frustrated by abuse or poverty.</p>
        <p>Royal is thus an ironic term, though not entirely, since in the prolific William T. Vollmann's new novel, the ''whores,'' as he generally calls the members of the family, are given both humanity and stature. More important in Mr. Vollmann's new novel, other people who are not in the life pay a kind of fealty to those who are, or as Mr. Vollmann writes in a brief foreword, ''Let this book, like its characters, be devoted to Addiction, Addicts, Pushers, Prostitutes and Pimps.''</p>
        <p>An immense literary talent is on display as Mr. Vollmann fulfills the mission he declares in those lines. Not for nothing has this author of books like ''The Rainbow Stories'' (in which prostitutes also figure prominently) and ''An Afghanistan Picture Show'' been declared a leading member of a new wave of hip, darkly sexual novelists who appeal mainly to a jaded, gilded youth.</p>
        <p>But in rambling through the luxuriant undergrowth of this new novel, you do wonder about the purpose to which his talent is being put. ''The Royal Family,'' which starts out with a brilliant sort of causticity, demonstrates Mr. Vollmann's verbal power and inventiveness. And yet it is a frustrating, tiresome and conceptually precious book as well, overwhelmed by logorrhea, a numbing repetitiveness and an underlying moral vision that, despite the electrical shock treatment that Mr. Vollmann gives it, has been old hat since the days of William Burroughs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vollmann has such a penchant for glittery meta-elaboration, for relentless, spoofy gamesmanship that he leaves the saturated reader begging for surcease.</p>
        <p>The story of ''The Royal Family'' is relatively simple. Mr. Vollmann's sympathetic main character is Henry Tyler, a San Francisco private investigator who is in love with Irene, the Korean wife of his brother, John, a smart, ambitious, unlikable lawyer. Henry has been hired by an unscrupulous businessman named Brady to find a certain Queen of the Whores, who is reputed to hold court among San Francisco prostitutes. When Irene, who gives up striving to endure her life with the disapproving, coldhearted John, kills herself, Tyler finds a bitter sort of solace by entering into ''the life'' himself, as a special friend of the Queen and her stable of women.</p>
        <p>But the purpose of this novel is much less to tell a story than to depict the unconventional moral universe of the royal family, which exists parallel to that of us more conventional commoners. Mr. Vollmann, whose research among prostitutes from San Francisco to the south of Thailand has been well reported in the press, has done ample reporting of his own on the subject for this novel, too, and his characters, with names like Domino, Strawberry and Chocolate, are brought vividly and lengthily to life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vollmann, who makes occasional appearances in his book, tells us, for example, that he made Strawberry up ''out of three sad women I know.'' He provides a witty disquisition on bail and bail bondsmen drawn from his own reporting. He thoroughly explores the psychic underworld of pimps and johns and others, like Henry, who discover within themselves hidden reservoirs of sado-masochism, of urges to be humiliated and hurt, to descend, in other words, into luscious degradation.</p>
        <p>''Desperate and confused to the very bottom of his soul, he struggled among square tomblike openings far-spaced in the yellow walls of death, wanting to escape back into pure numb death but the Queen would not let him,'' Mr. Vollmann writes of Henry, who becomes a sort of abused lover of the Queen of the Whores. ''It hurt so much! Tear-streams gushed like pale urine from his eyes. He was weeping for Irene and gagging on his own grief.''</p>
        <p>And so forth at considerable length, for there is nothing epigrammatic in Mr. Vollmann, who seems unable to leave out anything that he has learned or thought during his researches. But ''The Royal Family,'' which starts out with plenty of narrative intrigue, as Henry searches for the Queen and thinks of Irene, turns into an extended series of literary displays by Mr. Vollmann.</p>
        <p>He gives us portraits drawn from ''the life,'' like that of Dan Smooth, who fantasizes having sex with children and talks about it with a kind of jaundiced eloquence. He introduces a lengthy digression on ''a character without a name'' whose fetish is retarded women. (''They could be called perpetual children. That was the usual way to think of them, two-day piglets, puny and short-furred like monkeys.'' )</p>
        <p>He writes a series of chapters, parodies of criminal underworld fiction, on the ''Feminine Circus,'' a virtual erotic emporium created by Brady in Las Vegas. (''I'm just amazed no one ever thought of it before,'' Mr. Vollmann has a Las Vegas taxi driver tell Tyler. ''It sums up the national mood, you could almost say. It's brilliant. It's as real as you want it to be.'')</p>
        <p>All along, Mr. Vollmann bears us aloft on the swelling currents of his prose, which is psychedelic, hallucinatory, slyly self-referential and confiding. It creates a bond of mutual knowingness and sophistication between writer and reader, who become brothers and sisters in this extended appreciation of the perverse side of human nature, refusing ever to be so hokey as to actually be shocked. Is Mr. Vollmann daring, as the dust jacket contends? Given how fashionable it is to be jadedly amoral in fiction today, to be transgressive (a word often used to describe Mr. Vollmann), ''The Royal Family'' is probably less daring than it is chic, with the author not so much creating a new sensibility as catering to an established, vicarious, middle-class bohemianism spiced by recreational drugs.</p>
        <p>His novel is in many ways extraordinary, and I will always be interested in knowing what is stewing in Mr. Vollmann's furious imagination. But this book, despite his talent, is less a fully realized work of literature than the protracted reverie of an especially precocious adolescent, full of energy and brilliance. But it is the kind of brilliance that flares and then fades, leaving vague, transient afterimages in the mind, but nothing permanent to alter your vision.</p>
