        <p>The Ford Motor Company said today that its chief executive and president, Jacques A. Nasser, had declined invitations to testify next week before Congressional committees investigating tire failures, mainly on Ford Explorers. This prompted criticism from one lawmaker who is leading inquiries into the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Bridgestone/Firestone, the American unit of Bridgestone of Japan, agreed to send its chief executive, Masatoshi Ono, to testify even though he speaks limited English, Bridgestone and Congressional officials said. Bridgestone has been criticized until now for not being as open about the recall as Ford.</p>
        <p>Jason Vines, a Ford spokesman, said Mr. Nasser was most needed at the company's headquarters to oversee the recall and work with tire makers and other Ford suppliers. A senior Ford safety official and a senior engineer, both of whom have been involved with every detail of the problem, will be sent to testify instead, he said.</p>
        <p>But Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who heads a House Commerce subcommittee that will be holding a hearing next Wednesday, said through a spokesman that it was ''curious'' that Mr. Nasser could find the time to make television advertisements about the recall but not to explain to Congress what had happened.</p>
        <p>''Tauzin is very miffed,'' said Ken Johnson, the congressman's communications director. ''We want Ford's unscripted version of what went wrong.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson said Mr. Ono had agreed to come to Washington because ''he's anxious to testify.''</p>
        <p>The tussle between lawmakers and Ford came as the automaker blamed Bridgestone for tire problems in Venezuela and Thailand, while Bridgestone said it did not believe there was a problem with the tires.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vines said that Ford asked Bridgestone three times to check the quality of its tires in Venezuela, but that Bridgestone's scientists in Venezuela and Akron, Ohio, had insisted that they could never find any problem with them.</p>
        <p>Ford ended up recalling the Explorers equipped with Firestone tires in Venezuela in May and replacing them with Goodyear tires at Ford's own expense after a series of crashes, Mr. Vines said in a telephone conference call today. Ford engineers have cut up some of the recalled tires and found that the rate of tread separation on them is 500 times that for Firestone ATX tires made in 1996 in the United States, which have the highest rate of separation of any of the tires being recalled in the United States.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone maintained today that the tires met Ford's specifications and did not have quality problems. Bridgestone said it did not need to recall any tires on other manufacturers' vehicles in Venezuela, although the tire maker has asked its dealers to return unsold tires that may have been mislabeled. Toyota, which equipped some Land Cruisers with the same tires in Venezuela, said it had not heard reports of problems and did not see a need for a recall. Bridgestone and Firestone said that none of the Venezuelan tires were shipped to the United States.</p>
        <p>Jorge Dominguez, chief investigator for Venezuela's consumer protection agency, the Institute for Consumer Protection and Education, today repeated the accusation he made on Monday -- that Ford shared responsibility for the crashes. He noted that some Explorers had rolled over. ''There are problems with the tire and there are problems with the vehicle -- let's be clear about this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vines said that statistics in the United States showed that the Explorer was less likely to roll over than other sport utilities. Venezuela does not keep comparably detailed figures on traffic deaths. Ford urged the Venezuelan consumer agency today to set up an independent commission to review the tire issue, instead of proceeding with its plans to bring formal complaints against Ford and Bridgestone on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Jon Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said this evening that Ford's Venezuelan subsidiary had asked Bridgestone's Venezuelan subsidiary in October 1998 to study why Ford was receiving reports of tire failures on Explorers. That is the earliest that Ford has acknowledged that any of its operations were aware of problems with the Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone assured Ford in November 1998 that the tires in Venezuela did not pose a problem, and provided further reassurances in January, March and August of 1999 in response to further Ford inquiries, Mr. Harmon said. Bridgestone officials said they would check their records.</p>
        <p>In Thailand, where Ford replaced Firestone tires on 160 Explorers in March and April, Ford officials said today that they had thought the problem was because of unique climate conditions there.</p>
        <p>The first people to point out problems with the Firestone tires on those Explorers were not the buyers, but the drivers of the company's own fleet of 40 Explorers, said Mike Pease, executive director of Ford Sales and Service Thailand, in Bangkok. Early this year, Ford's Thai drivers discovered two or three Firestone tires with cracks near the treads, Mr. Pease said.</p>
        <p>Ford sent the tires to Bridgestone's Thai subsidiary, which told Ford that its tests were inconclusive. All 160 Explorers sold in Thailand happened to have tires from Bridgestone's factory in Decatur, Ill., and the recall in the United States has focused on tires from that factory.</p>
        <p>Ichiro Fukumori, managing director of Bridgestone's Thai operations, said he had no knowledge of Ford's sending it defective tires. Mr. Pease declined to identify exactly whom at Bridgestone Ford had communicated with.</p>
