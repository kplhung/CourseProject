        <p>THEY are all so very curious when Anne Militello lights the lights. Many stop and stare. Some pester her with questions. Others just sit at the curb and watch for half an hour.</p>
        <p>She is often too busy to notice. There she is on West 42nd Street, talking into her headset, carrying her walkie-talkie and her notebook, staring at the mysterious new 10-story building before her, programming its rippling facade of multicolored lights. She starts at dusk. She has often worked until dawn.</p>
        <p>On a recent evening she was fine-tuning her lighting compositions, which have been playing nightly since last month. ''O.K., try it,'' she said into the headset.</p>
        <p>''Sure,'' replied her head electrician, Ryan O'Gara, up on the fourth floor. The building went totally cherry-magenta.</p>
        <p>Ms. Militello has created the 13,000-square-foot illuminated facade of the New 42nd Street Studios at 229 West 42nd Street. Inside are 14 rehearsal studios for theater and dance, as well as office space and a 199-seat black-box theater.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to light the facade in some way that makes it reflect the process inside,'' said Cora Cahan, president of the New 42nd Street Inc., which built the $29.6 million building.</p>
        <p>New structures in Times Square must have extravagant lighting and signs, ''but we didn't want advertisements,'' Ms. Cahan said. ''We wanted the facade to represent the experimentation going on inside -- for the building itself to be a sign, a symbol, a light sculpture.''</p>
        <p>Instead of mimicking the visual chaos on the block, ''I wanted to create a bit of peace,'' Ms. Militello said. ''Nothing too nuts.''</p>
        <p>And so, four years ago she began working with the architectural firm Platt Byard Dovell to design the $1 million computer-driven lighting system with its 300 lamps. Their light reflects off 54 rows of perforated brushed stainless steel fins on the exterior of the building, giving it the look of a high-tech Levolor in daytime. At night it is a coruscating mirror of cool fire.</p>
        <p>''I had ideas, but I needed to compose on the spot,'' Ms. Militello said. ''I needed to learn from the street.''  So in June and July, night after night, she was alone on a notorious street, a 5-foot-3, 117-pound artist armed with nothing more than a steel folding chair. Mr. O'Gara, though reachable by headset, was in another building.</p>
        <p>One night ''a group of gang kids wanted to give me a hard time,'' she said. They kicked over her chair, took away her notebook, and when she asked for it, taunted, ''What are you going to do for us?''</p>
        <p>''I asked them, 'What's your favorite color?' One of them snarled, 'Yeah -- I like blue.' She whispered into the headset and the building became a blue cascade. ''They were stunned. They gave me the notebook. They put my chair back up.''</p>
        <p>The street patrolmen from the precinct tried to be protective, but when they saw she could handle things, thank you, they began greeting her by saying, ''a little bit more blue on the left, please.''</p>
        <p>She still gets yelled at. The taunters don't know just how tough a cookie she is. Ms. Militello, 43, grew up second-generation Sicilian in Buffalo, the middle daughter of a barber father and a clerical-worker mother. She was so theater-mad that she volunteered at 11 to be an usher at Shea's Buffalo Theater. Later, taking her first lighting course at the State University of New York at Buffalo, ''I was hooked,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Flash forward (slowly, via Greyhound bus) to San Francisco in 1977, where she started doing the lighting for 10 punk bands a night at a music club, then did lights as a roadie on tour with Carlos Santana and Rick Danko. ''I was the only girl, so I kept a wrench handy because everyone tried to hit on me.''</p>
        <p>That was when she had black and blue spike hair and blue glitter on her face. One night in 1979 she met Sam Shepard at a party and found herself running the follow spotlight in his play, ''Suicide in B Flat,'' her first professional theater engagement. Back in New York, she followed that up by lighting 10 productions at Cafe La Mama, then working for Mabou Mines and at dance clubs like the Ritz, Danceteria and the Mudd Club.</p>
        <p>A 1984 Obie Award was followed by work on Broadway, music tours (from Elizabeth Swados to Richard Hell and the Voidoids), theater (Mr. Shepard's ''A Lie of the Mind'' at the Promenade Theater) and stores (Patricia Field on Eighth Street; Bloomingdale's fifth-floor furniture showroom for seven years).</p>
        <p>Suddenly, in 1991, she dropped everything to become an ''imagineer'' at the Walt Disney Company (helping to light ''Toontown'' at Disneyland and the ''Electric Parade'' in Tokyo). Then, in 1995, she started her own company to design the lights for Tom Waits, and for the current tours of Lou Reed and Pearl Jam. An addendum: she won her industry's Lighting Designer of the Year award in 1999 for illuminating the world's largest, most expensive theme-park attraction, ''The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man,'' at the Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla.</p>
        <p>There is a weirdly eclectic demand for Ms. Militello's compositions. The new ArtWorks Building in New Orleans. The Missoni couture store at 78th Street and Madison Avenue. And of course, Mr. Shepard and his new play, ''The Late Henry Moss,'' with Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Cheech Marin and Woody Harrelson.</p>
        <p>Yet whenever she can these days, Ms. Militello stands out there on 42nd Street, tweaking the lights. ''If I don't have a relationship right now, it's this building.''</p>
