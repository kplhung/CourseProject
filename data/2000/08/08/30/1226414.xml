        <p>While officials of New Jersey Transit know they cannot escape Murphy's Law, they think they can at least warn their riders when it is about to play havoc with their daily commute.</p>
        <p>To that end, the agency, the third largest public transit agency in the nation, is developing a free subscription service to notify its customers of delays, accidents, disruptions and other mishaps on train and bus routes.</p>
        <p>Notification will be by telephone, e-mail, cell phone or pager, and, ideally, will provide the alert before the customer leaves work or home.</p>
        <p>Jeff Warsh, New Jersey Transit's executive director, said the agency hoped to have the service up and running by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>''These messages will catch people at different points in their journeys,'' Mr. Warsh said. ''Some will be able to change their plans, alter their itineraries. At the very least it will tell those stuck on a train just why they are stuck.''</p>
        <p>The new service is an outgrowth of the agency's efforts to improve its Web site with such online features as ticket purchasing and trip planning. In the process, officials found that technology might allow them to address commuters' main gripe -- delays and lack of information about them. Rider surveys, Mr. Warsh said, clearly show that ''it makes people crazy to be stuck and not know why.''</p>
        <p>Already, according to other transit agency officials, the desire to know about delays has overloaded the agency's 800 number, leaving as many as 40 percent of the calls a year unanswered.</p>
        <p>And while conductors on trains are supposed to announce delays and, if they know, the reasons for them, not all of them comply, another agency official said.</p>
        <p>Other transit agencies, including Virginia Railway Express and the Maryland Mass Transit Administration, are working on similar online services, from ticket purchases to the kind of notification system that New Jersey Transit envisions.</p>
        <p>''It's about increasing the convenience and decreasing the levels of stress and frustration,'' Mr. Warsh said.</p>
