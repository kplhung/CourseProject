        <p>The front-running Pleasant Breeze galloped to an easy gate-to-wire victory in the Saratoga Breeders' Cup here today but startled his trainer, James Bond, by pulling up awkwardly after the finish line and being taken off in an equine ambulance.</p>
        <p>A New York Racing Association veterinarian, Celeste Kunz, said it did not appear as if the 5-year-old gelding had sustained a fracture.

        <p>The front-running Pleasant Breeze galloped to an easy gate-to-wire victory in the Saratoga Breeders' Cup here today but startled his trainer, James Bond, by pulling up awkwardly after the finish line and being taken off in an equine ambulance.</p>
        <p>A New York Racing Association veterinarian, Celeste Kunz, said it did not appear as if the 5-year-old gelding had sustained a fracture. ''He pulled up sore in his left front leg,'' she said. ''There does not appear to be any displacement of any bones, but he is going back for evaluation. His leg was put in a splint.''</p>
        <p>His jockey, Jorge Chavez, said Pleasant Breeze ran smoothly throughout the mile-and-a-quarter race, in which he easily repelled the challenge of the second- and third-place finishers, Catienus and Gander.</p>
        <p>''When we came back galloping nice and easy, I felt he was missing a step,'' Chavez said. ''He seemed to be favoring his left front. He could have stepped on a stone for all I know.''</p>
        <p>After X-rays were taken, Bond agreed that Pleasant Breeze's injury appeared to be minor.</p>
        <p>''We cannot find anything,'' the trainer said. ''We're hoping it's just a wrench. He's 100 percent now. So far there's no heat or swelling.''</p>
        <p>Pleasant Breeze won by two-and-three-quarters lengths in 2:02, paid $4.00 to win and earned $180,000 for his owner, William L. Clifton Jr.</p>
