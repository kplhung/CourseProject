        <p>What my dentist cried out one day after finally removing an unsuspected fourth nerve from one of my molars comes to mind each time I try to understand myself as a writer. Do I, as a writer, have what he called a ''hidden nerve''?</p>
        <p>Don't all writers have a hidden nerve, call it a secret chamber, something irreducibly theirs, which stirs their prose and makes it tick and turn this way or that, and identifies them, like a signature, though it lurks far deeper than their style, or their voice or other telltale antics?</p>
        <p>A hidden nerve is what every writer is ultimately about. It's what all writers wish to uncover when writing about themselves in this age of the personal memoir. And yet it's also the first thing every writer learns to sidestep, to disguise, as though this nerve were a deep and shameful secret that needs to be swathed in many sheaths. Some don't even know they've screened this nerve from their own gaze, let alone another's. Some crudely mistake confession for introspection. Others, more cunning perhaps, open tempting shortcuts and roundabout passageways, the better to mislead everyone. Some can't tell whether they're writing to strip or hide that secret nerve.</p>
        <p>I have no idea to which category I belong.</p>
        <p>As for a sheath, however, I'd spot mine in a second. It is place. I begin my inward journey by writing about place. Some do so by writing about love, war, suffering, cruelty, power, God or country. I write about place, or the memory of place. I write about a city called Alexandria, which I'm supposed to have loved, and about other cities that remind me of a vanished world to which I allegedly wish to return. I write about exile, remembrance and the passage of time. I write -- so it would seem -- to recapture, to preserve and return to the past, though I might just as easily be writing to forget and put that past behind me.</p>
        <p>And yet my hidden nerve lies quite elsewhere. To work my way closer to it, I'd have to write about loss and feeling unhinged in provisional places where everyone else seems to have a home and a place, and where everyone knows what he wants, who he is and who he's likely to become.</p>
        <p>My Alexandrians, however, have an unsteady foothold wherever they stand; they shift time zones, life passions, loyalties and accents with the unwieldy sense that the real world swims before them, that they are strangers in it, that they're never quite entitled to it. Yet peel this second sheath, and you'll find another.</p>
        <p>I may write about place and displacement, but what I'm really writing about is dispersion, evasion, ambivalence: not so much a subject as a move in everything I write. I may write about little parks in New York that remind me of Rome and about tiny squares in Paris that remind me of New York, and about so many spots in the world that will ultimately take me back to Alexandria. But this crisscrossed trajectory is simply my way of showing how scattered and divided I am about everything else in life.</p>
        <p>I may never mention dispersion or evasion by name. But I write around them. I write away from them. I write from them, the way some people write around loneliness, guilt, shame, failure, disloyalty, the better to avoid staring at them.</p>
        <p>Ambivalence and dispersion run so deep that I don't know whether I like the place I've chosen to call my home, any more than I know whether I like the writer or even the person I am when no one's looking. And yet the very act of writing has become my way of finding a space and of building a home for myself, my way of taking a shapeless, marshy world and firming it up with paper, the way the Venetians firm up eroded land by driving wooden piles into it.</p>
        <p>I write to give my life a form, a narrative, a chronology; and, for good measure, I seal loose ends with cadenced prose and add glitter where I know things were quite lusterless. I write to reach out to the real world, though I know that I write to stay away from a world that is still too real and never as provisional or ambivalent as I'd like it to be. In the end it's no longer, and perhaps never was, the world that I like, but writing about it. I write to find out who I am; I write to give myself the slip. I write because I am always at one remove from the world but have grown to like saying so.</p>
        <p>Thus I turn to Alexandria, the mythical home of paradox. But Alexandria is merely an alibi, a mold, a construct. Writing about Alexandria helps me give a geographical frame to a psychological mess. Alexandria is the nickname I give this mess. Ask me to be intimate, and I'll automatically start writing about Alexandria.</p>
        <p>I'll write about diaspora and dispossession, but these big words hold my inner tale together, the way lies help keep the truth afloat. I use the word exile, not because I think it is the right term, but because it approximates something far more intimate, more painful, more awkward: exile from myself, in the sense that I could so easily have had another life, lived elsewhere, loved others, been someone else.</p>
        <p>If I keep writing about places, it is because some of them are coded ways of writing about myself: like me, they are always somewhat dated, isolated, uncertain, thrust precariously in the middle of larger cities, places that have become not just stand-ins for Alexandria, but stand-ins for me. I walk past them and think of me.</p>
        <p>Let me turn the clock back 30 years.</p>
        <p>It is October 1968, and I've just arrived in New York City. Mornings are nippy. It's my second week here. I have found a job in the mailroom at Lincoln Center. During my rounds at 10:30 every morning the plaza is totally empty and its fountain silent. Here every day I am always reminded of my very early childhood, when my mother would take me for long walks along a quiet plantation road far beyond our home.</p>
        <p>There is something serene and peaceful in this memory. I go out every morning knowing that as soon as I get a whiff of a nippy Manhattan breeze, I'll encounter the memory of those plantation mornings and the hand that held mine along these long walks.</p>
        <p>Fast-forward more than two decades. It is 1992. On certain warm summer days at noon I go to pick up my mother on 60th Street, where she still works as an office clerk. We buy fruit and sandwiches on Broadway and walk awhile until we find a shady stone bench at Lincoln Center's Damrosch Park. At times I bring my 2-year-old son, who'll scamper about, eating a spoonful, then run back to hide in between raised flowers beds.</p>
        <p>Afterward he and I walk my mother back to her office; we say goodbye, then head toward Broadway to catch the bus across from a tiny park where Dante's statue stands. I tell him of Paolo and Francesca, and of cruel Gianciotto, and of Farinata the exile and Count Ugolino who starved with his children.</p>
        <p>Dante's statue still reminds me of the tales I told my son then; it reminds me of this park and of other small parks I've since written about, and of how I felt guilty as a son, letting my mother hold so menial a job in her 70's, taking her out for a walk when it was clearly too warm for her, and how, to write a memoir about our life in Egypt, I had hired a full-time baby-sitter who was only too glad to have the time off whenever I'd take my son to lunches that I resented sometimes because they'd steal me from my desk. I think back to that summer and to my explosive snubs whenever my mother complained I'd arrived too late again.</p>
        <p>One day, after losing my temper and making her cry at lunch, I went home and wrote about how she would sit in our balcony in Alexandria smoking a cigarette, and of how the wind had fanned her hair on the day she came to pick me up at school after someone had called home saying I had been suspended that day. Together we rode the tram downtown, naming the stations one by one.</p>
        <p>Now, whenever I look back to those hot afternoons at Lincoln Center, I see two boys, me and my son, and I see my mother both as she was during those summer lunches in the early 90's and as I remembered her on our walks along the plantation road two and a half decades earlier. But the one mother most clearly limned on those stone benches at Damrosch Park is the one riding the tram with me: serene, ebullient, carefree, catching the light of the sun on her face as she recited the name of the stations to me.</p>
        <p>I did not lie about the names of the tram stations, but I did make up the scene about her coming to school that day. It doesn't matter. For this scene's hidden nerve lay somewhere else: in my wanting to stay home and write, in not knowing which mother I was writing about, in wishing she could be young once more, or that I might be her young boy again, or that both of us might still be in Egypt, or that we should be grateful we weren't.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it had something to do with my failure to rescue her from work that day, which I'd inverted into her rescuing me from school; or perhaps with my reluctance to believe that an entirely invented scene could have so cathartic an effect, and that lies do purge the mind of mnemonic dead weight.</p>
        <p>I don't know. Perhaps writing opens up a parallel universe into which, one by one, we'll move all of our dearest memories and rearrange them as we please.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this is why all memoirists lie. We alter the truth on paper so as to alter it in fact; we lie about our past and invent surrogate memories the better to make sense of our lives and live the life we know was truly ours. We write about our life, not to see it as it was, but to see it as we wish others might see it, so we may borrow their gaze and begin to see our life through their eyes, not ours.</p>
        <p>Only then, perhaps, would we begin to understand our life story, or to tolerate it and ultimately, perhaps, to find it beautiful; not that any life is ever beautiful, but the measure of a beautiful life is perhaps one that sees its blemishes, knows they can't be forgiven and, for all that, learns each day to look the other way.</p>
