        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his new police commissioner took their community relations campaign to an Upper West Side church yesterday, attending a Mass and speaking again about the need for unity among the city's varied people.</p>
        <p>It was the second Sunday in a row of churchgoing for the mayor and Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik, who has made clear since his appointment a week ago that he considers improving police relations with the city's ethnic and racial groups a major part of his mandate.</p>
        <p>''Everybody that doesn't have a political agenda, they are talking about the same thing: uniting people,'' Mr. Kerik said, alluding to criticism last week by some black leaders who suggested his efforts are more show than substance. ''That is what I want to do with the New York City Police Department.''</p>
        <p>The two were greeted warmly at Holy Name of Jesus Roman Catholic Church on West 96th Street, first with applause during the service and later with handshakes and even some hugs from parishioners as they stood just outside the church, which celebrates Mass in three languages.</p>
        <p>''How has God blessed New York City?'' Mr. Giuliani said at the conclusion of the Spanish-language service to the roughly 400 members of the congregation, made up largely of natives of Central and South America. ''We are the most diverse city. We are the city that speaks the most languages in the history of the world. We practice every religion: on Friday at mosque, on Saturdays at the synagogue, on Sunday at the churches in all languages.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani urged churchgoers to respect their neighbors as well as police officers and discussed the need to reduce crime and his belief that the New York City police are ''better than any police department in the country'' at working with people from diverse cultures.</p>
        <p>But the mayor, who was criticized this year for his unapologetic reaction to the police shooting in March of an unarmed black man, acknowledged yesterday that work remained to be done on community relations. ''We need to reach out,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik urged church members to join community councils that advise precinct commanders, groups that he said would receive much more attention during his tenure, and reminded them about the department's campaign to recruit more black and Hispanic officers, noting that applications for the entrance exam are being accepted until Oct. 6.</p>
        <p>Their visit to the church, which came one week after a visit to a predominantly black church in East New York, Brooklyn, seemed to impress the parishioners.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we are going to work together,'' said one member, Milagros Stanly, 59. ''Maybe.''</p>
