        <p>The rate of violent crime in the United States continued a downward trend in 1999, with the 10 percent drop last year representing one of the largest decreases in decades, the Justice Department said today.</p>
        <p>The latest figures, released by the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, which exclude homicide,  show a continuation in declines in every major type of personal and property crime between 1993 and 1999. During this period, the rate of violent crimes in general declined 32.7 percent, while robbery with injury dropped 38.5 percent, aggravated assault decreased 41.2 percent and rape fell 40 percent.</p>
        <p>Results of the annual National Crime Victimization Survey, begun in 1972, show that property crime rates continue a 25-year downward trend. Rates of property crimes, including burglary and motor vehicle theft, dropped 9 percent from 1998 to 1999, decreasing to 198 per 1,000 households from 217 per 1,000  households.</p>
        <p>Americans were more secure in their homes from 1998 to 1999, with the number of completed burglaries dropping to 34.1 per 1,000, from 38.5 per 1,000 households.</p>
        <p>''After a period of slow decline that was interrupted by an increase from 1980 to 1981, the burglary rate fell each year through the rest of the period,'' the Justice Department report said. ''The 1999 household burglary rate was about a third that of the adjusted rate of 1973.''</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials attribute the continued drop in crime rates to a healthy economy, crime prevention programs, tougher sentences and more police officers on the street.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, in a statement, called the figures ''further proof that the Clinton-Gore administration's anticrime strategy of more police on our streets and fewer guns in the wrong hands has helped to create the safest America in a generation.''</p>
        <p>Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush's headquarters, told The Associated Press, ''It's typical for the Clinton-Gore administration to take credit for good things in America.'' But, he added, ''much of the credit for the decline in crime has to go to governors and local officials who have passed tougher laws, longer prison sentences and lowered parole rates.''</p>
        <p>The crime rate report is based on information on nonlethal violent and property crimes gathered during the annual National Crime Victimization Survey. In 1999, 42,895 households and 77,750 people age 12 or older were interviewed for the survey.</p>
        <p>Although homicides were not included in the survey, the report said preliminary data gathered separately by the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicated that the homicide rate declined about 8 percent last year. Males account for about three-quarters of homicide victims. About one in 8 of these victims is under 18 years old, and firearms are used in 7 of 10 homicides, it said.</p>
        <p>The report said 44 percent of last year's violent crimes against people were reported to police, compared with 34 percent of property crimes. Robbery was the violent crime most often reported, with 61 percent of incidents disclosed, while rape and other sexual assaults were the least often brought to the attention of law enforcement. Only 28 percent of these cases were reported.</p>
        <p>Men were more likely to be victims of violent crime, including robbery and assault, than women in 1999.</p>
        <p>''Males experienced violent crime at rates 28 percent greater, and were robbed at rates more than two times that of females,'' said the report. ''Females were victims of rape and sexual assault at 7.5 times greater the rate of males.''</p>
        <p>During 1999, it said, 3 women per 1,000 were raped or sexually assaulted, compared with 0.4 men per 1,000.</p>
