        <p>At 84, Antonia Sarmiento, nearly toothless and dressed in tattered rags, has seen a lot of tragedy in her life but never a miracle.</p>
        <p>But last week Mayor Gina Benedetti de Velez knocked at the door of her shabby clapboard shack to say  the local government would rebuild her house for no charge. President Clinton will be visiting the House of Justice across the street, the mayor explained, and he should not have to see such misery in Cartagena.</p>
        <p>''Bill Clinton is a saint brought to me from Heaven,'' said a smiling Mrs. Sarmiento, a widow of a police officer who lives, with a disabled son, on the charity of family members.</p>
        <p>Watching workmen struggle to complete the front facade in time for Mr. Clinton's visit on Wednesday, she added, ''I'd love to invite him inside for a bowl of sancocho'' -- a stew of chicken, potatoes and plantains -- ''but he would never visit a house like this.''</p>
        <p>Since local officials learned a month ago that President Clinton would be coming to this splendid Spanish colonial port of soaring church steeples and mounted cannons, they have rushed into a breathless urban renewal campaign perhaps not seen since Sir Francis Drake sacked the city in 1586. A thousand workmen are widening sidewalks, fixing cracked streets, whitewashing government buildings and planting palm trees.</p>
        <p>''This is the most important event in Cartagena's history since President Bush came here in 1990,'' said Mayor Benedetti. ''But this is even bigger.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's visit here to a regional presidential anti-narcotics conference -- with the usual bevy of reporters and camera crews -- helped bring a 34 percent increase in tourists the next year, local officials say.</p>
        <p>But the number of tourists has decreased because of the country's expanding war with Marxist guerrilla groups, from 865,379 tourists in Cartagena in 1994 to 535,103 last year. So people here are hoping that this visit will cause another surge in tourism, this city's most important industry.</p>
        <p>Mayor Benedetti is lobbying to urge Mr. Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea, to ride through the old city in a horse-drawn carriage, Cartagena's answer to Venice's gondolas, to show off its quaint narrow streets shaded by rococo balconies draped by lush tropical flowers.</p>
        <p>She also hopes to have a word with Mr. Clinton to press him to grant Cartagena an exception to the State Department travel advisory warning that Colombia is an exceptionally risky place for American tourists.</p>
        <p>No detail has been left to chance to create the perfect pictures and sound bites.</p>
        <p>About 150 homeless children have been removed from the streets to ''recreational centers'' on the outskirts of the city, and 1,500 kiosk owners have been told to haul their rickety wares off the presidential route on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
        <p>One thoroughfare along the beach, which taxi drivers have taken to renaming Avenida Clinton, has been closed for a complete repaving.</p>
        <p>''It's like a girl fixing up her house for her boyfriend's first visit,'' said El Tiempo, Bogota's leading newspaper, ''and asking that her parents and brothers behave themselves to make the best impression.''</p>
        <p>The round-the-clock grooming effort will cost the city $1 million -- a handsome sum for a city with an annual budget of $160 million -- to fix up the route Mr. Clinton will take during his eight-hour visit.</p>
        <p>And that does not count the contributions being made by the local telephone, electric and water companies to fix up damaged pipes, street holes and faulty wiring, or the efforts of store owners, who are washing down everything from their curtains to welcome mats.</p>
        <p>The Clinton visit has produced an almost giddy response from Cartagena residents, who never seem to tire of telling visitors that they live in an oasis far from the kidnappings and massacres that characterize the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>Actually, Cartagena is well below other Colombian cities in terms of crime and violence, and there have not been any serious incidents here since two bombings in 1989, one by the Medellin drug cartel and one by a Marxist guerrilla group.</p>
        <p>''President Clinton's visit will show the world that not all Colombians are bad,'' said Dimas Ortiz Rondono, 58, a lottery ticket seller who wears rosary beads around his neck and works beside the old slave market in the Plaza de los Coches, which Mr. Clinton is scheduled to visit. ''And then the tourists will flock back to us.''</p>
        <p>As Victor Prieto Castro, 53, a reporter for the local Victoria AM radio station, looked for foreign correspondents to interview, he was excited about covering the biggest story to come his way in some time.</p>
        <p>''You can't buy this kind of publicity,'' he said. ''We couldn't be happier. This trip is going to give Colombia a whole new image.''</p>
        <p>Not all Cartagena residents are so certain a that one-day visit by Mr. Clinton will make a lasting difference for a country that has suffered four decades of conflict, or for a Caribbean tourist destination that most cruise ship companies would just as soon pass to keep their passengers calm. Some even express concern that Mr. Clinton's presence could attract a terrorist attack, which could ruin the city's reputation forever.</p>
        <p>Leonor Sanchez, 40, a guide at the 17th-century Palace of the Inquisition, said she was happy that Mr. Clinton is scheduled to visit the Plaza de Bolivar outside the palace. But she said she was not sure that it was a good idea for Mr. Clinton to visit the building's torture chamber or the room upstairs where, she contends, Dominican priests used to indulge in wild orgies during their breaks from punishing Jews, homosexuals and witches.</p>
        <p>''This is the dark side of Colombia's history, when power was terribly abused,'' said Ms. Sanchez, a jolly woman with an encyclopedic knowledge of the old ways of stretching and mutilating bodies. ''He could get the bad impression that we have always been a violent country.''</p>
