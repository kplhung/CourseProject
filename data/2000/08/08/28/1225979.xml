        <p>Ray Davies turned his acid wit on himself Wednesday night at the Jane Street Theater. Changing guitars, he didn't quite secure the strap, and his instrument crashed to the ground.

        <p>Ray Davies turned his acid wit on himself Wednesday night at the Jane Street Theater. Changing guitars, he didn't quite secure the strap, and his instrument crashed to the ground. Mr. Davies affected a perplexed stance. ''I've been a rock star so long, I don't know what to do next!'' he sighed.</p>
        <p>This ''experimental evening,'' the first of three, established that Mr. Davies, 55, has hit upon something to do next. The writer and singer behind Britain's legendary Kinks who milked his catalog during his 1997 ''Storyteller'' tour, Mr. Davies has been exploring new material with the band Yo La Tengo. Introducing some of those new songs with the group and other guest performers, he lifted himself off his laurels and gave his cynicism a shake.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davies would have to be comatose to not respond to Yo La Tengo's ministrations. The trio, with Ira Kaplan on guitar, James McNew on bass and Georgia Hubley on drums, displays a keen awareness of rock history; its sound is a new thing made from the best of the past. The Kinks have always been a major influence on Yo La Tengo, and its reinterpretation of Mr. Davies's classic rock created a window inward that flattered and challenged him.</p>
        <p>''Next Door Neighbors'' was a typical Davies portrait of simmering suburbia, but Mr. Kaplan's guitar, feeding back like whispered gossip, added fresh tension. ''Bridge for Dreams,'' a tart look at Thanksgiving rituals that featured the rhythm section of John Abbey and Ira Elliot, got some spring from a Ray Price-style western swing arrangement.</p>
        <p>On ''Otis Riff,'' a homage to the 1960's, the band turned nostalgia into novelty. And ''The Morning After,'' a full-speed-ahead rocker about life's perilous second act, perfectly melded Yo La Tengo's mood-based style with Mr. Davies's braininess.</p>
        <p>Everyone onstage knew these songs were good. Mr. Kaplan, normally a stern introvert, couldn't stop grinning. Peter Matheson, Mr. Davies's longtime guitarist, delivered leads with playful spark. Mr. Davies bounced around, striking rockabilly poses, knocking over his stool and spilling his cup of water. He didn't look silly playing the kid.</p>
        <p>The excitement waned a bit when Mr. Davies turned away from new material to go into his ''Storytellers'' mode. A lengthy set piece about how the Kinks were hurt in America by bad business decisions, with Chris Maxwell on bass and Phil Hernandez on drums, should have been left behind. The pared-down opening songs, ''To the Bone'' and ''Rock-and-Roll Fantasy,'' honor the rock lifestyle in a way appropriate to the site for the groundbreaking musical ''Hedwig and the Angry Inch,'' but they weren't as stirring as the new material.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davies did best when he followed Yo La Tengo's lead in looking backward, too. At the group's request he pulled out rarities like ''Animal Farm,'' ''This Strange Effect,'' and ''I Need You,'' which he claimed to have avoided since recording it in 1965. He squeezed excitement from these shunned treasures.</p>
        <p>''This band knows my work better than I do,'' he said of Yo La Tengo. Their meeting helped Mr. Davies get a healthy new crush on himself.</p>
