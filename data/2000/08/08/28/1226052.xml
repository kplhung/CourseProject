        <p>Four tourists were slightly hurt yesterday when a horse-drawn carriage tipped onto its side in Central Park, tossing the tourists, a vacationing British family, onto the asphalt, the police said.</p>
        <p>The accident occurred at 11:15 a.m. just inside the park near its entrance at Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas.</p>
        <p>The carriage driver, Naim Aydin, said he had just completed a circuit of the park with the family aboard and had stopped at a trough to water the horse. As he led it through a left turn, the carriage tilted past its balance point and suddenly slammed onto its side, dumping out Colin Howe, 55, his wife, Pauline, 54, and Charlotte and Michael, their two children, who are 13 and 10. The police did not know the Howes' hometown in Britain.</p>
        <p>''It just fell over,'' Mr. Aydin said. ''I am unhappy.''</p>
        <p>Although the accident created an alarming scene -- the Howes were strapped to back boards by medical workers and then taken away in ambulances -- the authorities said the accident was not serious. The Howes were treated at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center and released. A hospital administrator said they had minor cuts in bruises and planned to resume their vacation.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Aydin nor the horse, which he said was brought to the city two days before, were injured. The horse apparently did not tip with the carriage. The only apparent damage to the carriage was a dent on the left fender. The horse was led back to its stable on West 52nd Street and 12th Avenue, leaving Mr. Aydin and a friend to push the carriage 13 blocks.</p>
