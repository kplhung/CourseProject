        <p>The Russian-appointed leader of Chechnya gestured toward the crowd that had gathered to wish him a happy 49th birthday at his heavily guarded home in this Chechen town.  Some, he noted dryly, could well be rebel agents.</p>
        <p>''They are everywhere and nowhere,'' Akhmad Kadyrov said with a shrug. ''Some of them might even be among these people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kadyrov ought to know. He has already survived several assassination attempts, including one two months ago, which was averted when a huge bomb was discovered along the road 100 yards from his house. Last year, a bomb that was apparently intended for Mr. Kadyrov killed five of his relatives.</p>
        <p>It is just another week in Chechnya, a battered, dispirited but proud Caucasus land that continues to present Russia's gravest security challenge. A year after Russian troops poured into the region, the breakaway republic is no longer the scene of major Russian artillery barrages and pitched battles involving thousands of soldiers against rebels who are seeking an independent republic.</p>
        <p>But the war has not gone away. Russian casualties continue every week as the fighting has shifted from large-scale assaults to skirmishing and ambushes that have turned Chechnya into a nasty quagmire for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his top generals.</p>
        <p>Almost everyone seems to agree that Russian firepower alone cannot bring an end to the fighting and that a political solution is necessary. That is where Mr. Kadyrov is supposed to come in, but so far a resolution of the conflict seems as distant as ever.</p>
        <p>''The war can't be ended by military means,'' Mr. Kadyrov said. ''We Chechens have to stop it ourselves. If we can't, the war will go on for 10 or 20 years.''</p>
        <p>In the baking summer heat, Chechnya often seems deceptively quiet. There is a weary routine about the searches at the Russian checkpoints, the noisy helicopter flights to and from the Russian strongholds and the bustle at Chechen marketplaces.</p>
        <p>Even a good day, however, can be grim and frighteningly unpredictable. Grozny, Chechnya's nominal capital and a ruin of a city, still lacks gas, electricity and any visible efforts at restoration. Only a few thousand people still seem to live there, but now they include rebels who have managed to sneak back into city.</p>
        <p>They shoot at the Russian checkpoints at night, prompting noisy fire fights that residents say keep them awake. Squads of Kalashnikov-bearing Russian soldiers move past the kiosks and makeshift shops but do not linger long. In one brazen attack this week, two Russian soldiers were shot to death at point-blank range while they were shopping in Grozny's central market.</p>
        <p>''It's becoming more and more dangerous,'' said Yuri Vasilkov, a 19-year old draftee from the southern Russian town of Taganrog, who was manning a Grozny checkpoint. ''A major attack could come at any time -- tonight, tomorrow, now.''</p>
        <p>Officially, Russian generals contend that this is nothing to worry about. The guerrilla attacks, they insist, are just the final phase of a terrible war that is all but won. The military, in fact, has already made plans to station a permanent garrison in Chechnya to secure the peace.</p>
        <p>It consists primary of the army's newly created 42nd Division, whose members are being sent to four strategic locations. With 15,000 members, the unit is larger and better equipped than most. But at Borzoy, a mountain village that sits astride a potential rebel supply corridor to Georgia, half of the division's troops are young conscripts with no previous experience in Chechnya. The other half are ''kontraktniki,'' essentially mercenaries who often have some military experience and fight for pay.</p>
        <p>''This is peace,'' insists Col. Andrei Fyodorov, 39, who commands the Borzoy detachment. ''The situation is under control.''</p>
        <p>Other Russian officers, however, have a dimmer view. They say the rebels may only have several thousand full-time fighters compared with the approximately 80,000 soldiers and policeman the Kremlin has sent to Chechnya. But the rebels have also adapted their tactics.</p>
        <p>Instead of mounting large and costly attacks against major Russian bases and troop concentrations, the rebels plant mines, set off bombs and try to pick off small groups of soldiers -- pinprick attacks that are slowly bleeding Russian forces.</p>
        <p>According to official statistics, 17 Russian troops were killed and 52 wounded last week, a tranquil week by Chechnya standards. All told, more than 2,500 Russian fighters have been killed and 7,500 wounded in the last year.</p>
        <p>The rebels have also sought to infiltrate village administrations throughout Chechnya, hoping to gain control of food and other supplies so they can divert them to their fighters in the woods and mountains. When Russian officials uncovered a rebel camp last month in the Shatoy mountain region they discovered that it was filled with goods sent to aid the civilian population.</p>
        <p>Village officials who resist the rebels are often the targets of attacks, along with their relatives. In the last two weeks, local officials in Meskety, Nozhay-Yurt and Urus-Martan have been attacked.</p>
        <p>''Yes, we have cases where local administrations have been infiltrated,'' Mr. Kadyrov said. ''We are setting up a new commission now to check all of the officials in Chechnya, to find out who is charge of what and check all aspects of what they are doing.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, nobody knows the difficulty of controlling Chechnya better than Mr. Kadyrov, whom Mr. Putin appointed two months ago to administer the republic. Mr. Kadyrov is the first Chechen leader to be installed by Moscow since 1996.</p>
        <p>A former Muslim cleric, Mr. Kadyrov opposed the Russians during the first Chechen war, from 1994 to 1996, which routed Russian forces and gave Chechnya de facto independence. Mr. Kadyrov supported Aslan Maskhadov, the Chechen commander who became the first president of the breakaway republic after that war.</p>
        <p>But after Islamic militants based in Chechnya invaded neighboring Dagestan and Russian troops responded by invading Chechnya, Mr. Kadyrov broke with Mr. Maskhadov and decided to work with the Russians. Each has denounced the other as a traitor, dimming the already bleak prospect for negotiations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kadyrov appeared relaxed at his birthday celebration with his family and Chechen officials, even as machine-gun-toting bodyguards stood by, chanting Muslim prayers before feasting on lamb, potatoes and soft drinks.</p>
        <p>''It does not matter if we are part of Russia or independent,'' Mr. Kadyrov said. ''What does a man really need? He needs a permanent job and salary. And he needs to be able to leave his house safely to go work and to come back safely in the evening. That is what freedom means. And where should we go? We are surrounded by Russia.''</p>
        <p>To encourage a political solution, he has negotiated with several field commanders, including Ruslan Gelayev. Several minor rebel leaders have come over to his side. But Mr. Kadyrov says he will never make a deal with Shamil Basayev or Khattab, two of the best-known rebel commanders, or with Mr. Maskhadov.</p>
        <p>Some critics doubt that Mr. Kadyrov will be able to establish his authority in Chechnya. They note that he cannot even control Bislan Gantamirov, a former mayor of Grozny who was jailed for embezzlement and released by the Russians so that he could fight on their side. Unlike Mr. Kadyrov, Mr. Gantamirov controls a Chechen militia, and he has especially close ties with much of the Russian military.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Kadyrov fired some local officials loyal to Mr. Gantamirov, the former Grozny mayor led a band of his men to Gudermes, the administrative capital and site of Mr. Kadyrov's government headquarters. It was a blunt show of force, and relations between the two pro-Moscow Chechens are still frosty.</p>
        <p>''Kadyrov does not have the means to control the situation inside the Chechen republic,'' said Malik Saidullayev, a Chechen businessman and a rival.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kadyrov asserts that he can prevail. He plans to attend a religious conference in the United States and, making use of his common ground with them as a former cleric, ask the Arab members not to provide the financial support that has been coming in to the rebels from Muslims around the world.</p>
        <p>His hardest task, however, is to persuade the Chechen people that they have more to gain by accepting Russian control over their republic and putting down their guns. For all the Russian firepower, he says, the fighting will not end until ordinary Chechens stop giving aid and sanctuary to the rebels.</p>
        <p>''We are hiding them,'' Mr. Kadyrov said. ''We Chechens, not Kadyrov. We give them shelter. We feed them. If we closed all the doors to them, then everyone would see them. This is the only way to solve this problem.''</p>
