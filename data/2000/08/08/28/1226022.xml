        <p>Clinton Urges Nigeria To Confront AIDS Crisis  President Clinton, seeking to break down the taboos shrouding AIDS, a disease that has devastated Africa, urged Nigerians to fight the  ''tyranny'' of AIDS with the same resolve they displayed in enduring decades of dictatorship. He also encouraged Nigerian businessmen to work to expand the economy beyond its heavy reliance on oil.</p>

        <p>Fighting Not Over in Chechnya  Chechnya continues to present Russia's gravest security challenge, a year after Russian troops poured into the breakaway republic. Russian casualties mount every week as the fighting has shifted from large-scale assaults to skirmishes.</p>

        <p>Moscow Tower Burns  Fire engulfed the Ostankino television tower in Moscow, the world's second-tallest free-standing structure, trapping four people in an elevator and knocking out most of the city's television channels.</p>

        <p>Polish Church Apology  The leaders of Poland's Roman Catholic Church have asked forgiveness for church toleration of anti-Semitism and disdain of non-Catholics in a letter of joint apologies for failings in the church's history.</p>

        <p>Where the European Union Ends  Poland's frontier with Belarus will soon become the European Union's border with the wild, untamable, unreformed east. Whether the Poles like it or not, much of the burden of blocking illegal trade and immigration into the European Union will fall on them.</p>

        <p>Israel Defends West Bank Raid  Israeli officials acknowledged that ''friendly fire'' may have been responsible for the deaths of three Israeli soldiers, but defended the attack on the West Bank hideout of Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, a leader of the underground military wing of Hamas. Mr. Hanoud fled during the assault to the Palestinian-governed city of Nablus, where he surrendered to local security officials.</p>

        <p>Parliamentary Vote in Lebanon  Lebanon went to the polls in the beginning of a two-stage parliamentary election overshadowed by Syrian dominance and a struggle between the current government and its critics. Results from the voting were expected to be announced today.</p>

        <p>Five Are Freed in Philippines  Five foreign hostages were released by kidnappers in the southern Philippines for a reported $5 million ransom, ending a four-month standoff in which the island of Jolo has been flooded with ransom money both for the hostages and for a dozen journalists who have been seized while trying to interview them.</p>

        <p>NATIONAL</p>
        <p>A10-14</p>
        <p>Gore Challenges Bush On Health Plan Details  Vice President Al Gore called for an intelligent discussion of health care policy as part of the presidential campaign, and suggested that Gov. George W. Bush's proposals, particularly for a prescription drug benefit for the elderly, have yet to meet a ''minimal standard of substance for serious debate.'' Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush's running mate, said Mr. Bush was still working on a plan for financing a prescription drug benefit.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Mr. Gore's running mate, called for a greater role for religion in American public life in comments at one of Detroit's largest African-American churches. His themes, including declaring that belief in God is the basis of morality and of the nation, were remarkably similar to those commonly voiced by conservative Republicans. Also, the president of the Detroit branch of the N.A.A.C.P. praised Mr. Lieberman for defending the interests of blacks.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Cheney Addresses Military Cuts  Mr. Cheney acknowledged that the military cutbacks he and Mr. Bush have campaigned against began when Mr. Cheney was defense secretary for Mr. Bush's father, but he blamed the Clinton administration for making ''far deeper'' cuts that he said had left the military ''in decline.''</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Military Reserves Falling Short  The nation's military Reserves are struggling to fill their ranks with new recruits, even as the Pentagon relies on them more heavily than ever for its operations. There are now spot shortages in some units. The decline in recruits with military service has also meant the Reserves have had to rely on enlistees with no experience, resulting in higher training costs and less seasoned units.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>New Growth Plan for Iowa  Iowa is proposing something no other state has done to reverse its population decline: an all-out immigrant recruitment drive. Officials fear that without an infusion of immigrants, who now make up only 2 percent of the state's population, there will not be enough workers to allow new businesses to open or existing ones to expand or even replace retirees.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Violent Crime Drop Continues  The rate of violent crime in the United States continued a downward trend in 1999, with the 10 percent drop last year representing one of the largest decreases in decades, the Justice Department said. Law enforcement officials attribute the drop in crime rates to a healthy economy, crime prevention programs, tougher sentences and more police officers on the street.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>DNA Link to Black History  Powerful new gene technology is being enlisted in at least three projects to help black Americans' search for their African ancestry. Most likely, the ability to ''show reasonably accurate probabilities of association'' between living African-Americans and African cultures will be possible in two years or so, given enough financing, according to one project director.</p>

        <p>NEW YORK/REGION</p>
        <p>B1-5</p>
        <p>Winning Washington's Ear With Money and a Tale  David Chang, a generous donor to many politicians, pleaded guilty in June to channeling more than $53,000 in illegal contributions to Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey. Mr. Chang is now at the center of a federal inquiry into the possibility that Mr. Torricelli's 1996 campaign staff may have been complicit in Mr. Chang's illegal donations -- something the senator strongly denies.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>A City's Fortunes Rebound  Troy, N.Y., a Hudson River city that was broke five years ago, now has a balanced budget and money for improvements. The turnaround is a tale that involves citizens who would not give up on their city and a new mayor who raised taxes and made hard choices. But Troy also received millions in aid from the state and remains dependent economically on the financial success of New York City.</p>
        <p>B1</p>
        <p>State Bond Act Awaits Details  More than two months after a self-imposed deadline, Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders have not produced an agreement on how the money for a $3.8 billion bond act for transportation projects will be spent if it is approved by voters. The lack of an agreement makes it hard for anyone to know what it is they may be campaigning for or against. This could bode ill for a borrowing measure that many say is a necessary step for building a Second Avenue subway line and other mass transit projects.</p>

        <p>Bahamian Band's Dream Lives  The Baha Men's single, ''Who Let the Dogs Out,'' released and distributed independently, is turning into the summer anthem of 2000, radio programmers say. The tale of the making of that hit is one that crosses borders and spans generations, changing the fortunes of a Trinidadian soca singer, a Bahamian junkanoo band and a record executive who would not give up.</p>

        <p>China Seizes U.S. Book  Thousands of copies of a new book by a former official White House photographer were seized by Chinese officials as the copies were being shipped from a bindery in China because it contained a picture of the Dalai Lama, who is opposed by the Chinese government.</p>

        <p>New Bid for London Exchange  OM Gruppen, which runs the Stockholm stock exchange, is expected to make a formal offer, which could include a hostile bid, for the London Stock Exchange, which has rejected an informal $1.18 billion offer.</p>

        <p>Automaker to Raise Production  DaimlerChrysler plans to nearly double production in Alabama, adding another assembly line close to where it already builds M-Class sport utility vehicles. Industry sources said the company would make a combination minivan and sport utility vehicle.</p>
