        <p>President Clinton urged Nigerians today to eliminate the taboos associated with AIDS in Africa, and to confront what he called the ''tyranny'' of the disease with the same resolve they showed in enduring decades of dictatorship.</p>
        <p>''Is it harder to talk about these things than to watch a child die of AIDS who could have lived if the rest of us had done our part?'' the president asked at a women's conference here. ''Is it harder to talk about than to comfort a child whose mother has died? We have to break the silence about how this disease spreads and how to prevent it. And we need to fight AIDS, not people with AIDS.''</p>

        <p>President Clinton urged Nigerians today to eliminate the taboos associated with AIDS in Africa, and to confront what he called the ''tyranny'' of the disease with the same resolve they showed in enduring decades of dictatorship.</p>
        <p>''Is it harder to talk about these things than to watch a child die of AIDS who could have lived if the rest of us had done our part?'' the president asked at a women's conference here. ''Is it harder to talk about than to comfort a child whose mother has died? We have to break the silence about how this disease spreads and how to prevent it. And we need to fight AIDS, not people with AIDS.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's remarks presented a bold challenge, not only to Nigerians but to all in Africa, where health experts have lamented the fact that the stigma surrounding the disease and inadequate public education about its dangers have contributed to the spread of AIDS. An estimated 23 million Africans carry H.I.V., the virus that causes the disease.</p>
        <p>But while the president offered American support for Nigerian efforts to confront AIDS, he offered no new assistance. Africans reacted coolly to the United States' offer last month of $1 billion in annual loans to finance the purchase of anti-AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that the approach would merely add to the already heavy debt burden of African nations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton spent the day addressing some of the most pressing problems in Africa: AIDS, poverty, joblessness and soaring national debt. He ventured from the Nigerian capital to a rural village to get a glimpse of how a vast majority of Nigerians live and, winding up a two-day visit to Africa's newest democracy, he encouraged Nigerian businessmen to work to expand the economy beyond its heavy reliance on oil.</p>
        <p>Under a morning rain, the village chief, Muhammadu Baba, led Mr. Clinton through the muddy walkways traversing the village of Ushafa, where tin-roof huts house several thousand residents, as well as houses of worship, a pharmacy and health clinic.</p>
        <p>The president, accompanied by his daughter, Chelsea, received a rousing welcome as schoolchildren bearing tiny American flags sang greetings and native dancers spun around him in the center square. Mr. Clinton, to the delight of onlookers, slipped into a traditional Nigerian robe and held aloft a handmade hoe, both official gifts of the village.</p>
        <p>Later, at a hotel conference room in Abuja, Mr. Clinton told business executives that Nigeria would be added to the list of developing countries that receive duty-free status for their exports, and he vowed to increase ties between Nigeria and the United States, its largest export market. The elimination of tariffs could increase demand for Nigerian exports including cocoa, cotton, hand-made traditional textiles, minerals and forest products.</p>
        <p>But it was at a midday appearance before a crowded women's conference that Mr. Clinton addressed the health plight that if left unchecked, he said, would stymie the country even if political and economic reforms took root.</p>
        <p>Standing beside a man infected with the virus that has become the continent's leading killer, Mr. Clinton applauded Nigeria's efforts to control the spread of AIDS. But he offered a blunt reminder to Africans that the disease is preventable -- if people would only speak frankly about how it is spread, and take common-sense action.</p>
        <p>''AIDS is 100 percent preventable -- if we are willing to deal with it openly and honestly,'' he said. ''In every country, in any culture, it is difficult, painful, at the very least, embarrassing to talk about the issues involved with AIDS.''</p>
        <p>The president announced no new funds for Nigeria's AIDS fight but he detailed the $20 million the United States will spend this year to control the spread of AIDS, malaria and polio in Nigeria. He reported that AIDS education would be included as part of the military training that United States troops are giving to Nigerian peacekeepers headed to nearby Sierra Leone, which has been ravaged by civil war.</p>
        <p>He told the audience of young people, religious leaders and women at the conference in Abuja that Nigerians, despite the introduction of civilian rule last year, would never be free until they bring infectious diseases under control. An estimated 5.4 percent of Nigeria's 114 million people are infected with the AIDS virus, according to the White House, giving it one of the highest infection rates on the continent.</p>
        <p>''I am amazed at the courage of the people of Nigeria in struggling against the oppression that you endured for too long until you got your democracy,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''I urge you now to show that same kind of courage to beat the tyranny of this disease so you can keep your democracy alive for all the children of Nigeria and their future.''</p>
        <p>United States officials, frustrated by the lack of action by some African governments, have praised President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria for making the fight against AIDS a priority. But Mr. Obasanjo stressed today that Nigeria would need help from the rest of the world to win its struggle against the disease.</p>
        <p>''It is not a disease you can say if you eradicate it in Nigeria, it is eradicated for good,'' Mr. Obasanjo said. ''Those from Nigeria who go outside and have sexual relations with those who have H.I.V.-AIDS or have blood transfusions with them will bring it back. We don't see it as a Nigerian disease. We see it as a world disease that is ravaging Africa most.''</p>
        <p>Throughout Mr. Clinton's two-day visit here, Mr. Obasanjo has repeatedly raised the issue of debt relief, encouraging the wealthy nations of the world to forgive the large sums amassed by previous African rulers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasanjo, elected 15 months ago as part of Nigeria's tenuous transition to democracy, did not directly address the United States AIDS plan today. But in toasting Mr. Clinton at a state dinner on Saturday night, he made a plea for financial relief from the United States and other wealthy nations.</p>
        <p>''We know that we cannot achieve our desire for economic development if we continue to bleed from the gushing wounds of an ever-penetrating debt-repayment lance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, in addressing business leaders today, said past leaders of Nigeria -- a country that has suffered under corrupt dictators for most of its modern history -- had squandered its riches and must be careful to focus any debt relief on improving the lives of its people.</p>
        <p>In the village of Ushafa, Mr. Clinton saw how far Nigeria must still progress. The village lacks telephone service and running water and received electricity only several months ago. Mr. Clinton entered a small medical clinic that had been stocked with supplies by the State Department just the day before.</p>
        <p>One worker told the president that the clinic had treated 234 cases of malaria this year. There are no H.I.V. cases, villagers said, although nearby villages have cases and urban areas are heavily affected.</p>
        <p>The United States assistance to Nigeria includes $2 million in the current budget to produce insecticide-treated bed nets to keep malaria-infected mosquitoes at bay, as well as $9 million to battle polio and $10 million to assist the anti-AIDS fight. The White House has requested a $100 million increase, to $342 million, in international AIDS funds in the 2001 fiscal year budget.</p>
        <p>''This is not just Nigeria's fight, or Africa's fight,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''It is America's fight and the world's fight too.''</p>
        <p>The president's remarks heartened John Ibekwe, who heads an organization in Nigeria for people living with AIDS. ''With you as an advocate on our side, governments in Africa will do more than they are doing,'' Mr. Ibekwe said in introducing the president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who restricted his travel in Nigeria partly for security reasons, leaves for Tanzania early Monday for an update from former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa on the Burundi peace talks. He began his day at a Baptist church in Abuja, where he heard the Rev. Israel Akanji preach on the parable of the Good Samaritan.</p>
        <p>''Robbers have come; bandits have come,'' Mr. Akanji said of his country's struggles against its own leaders. ''We have been left wounded, bleeding and dying. Is there a Good Samaritan passing by?''</p>
