        <p>WBBM-TV, CBS station in Chicago has still not found enough of an audience for its 10 pm local news program, which sticks to news and information and avoids sensationalism and entertainment-world gossip (S)</p>

        <p>Last February, the CBS station in Chicago, WBBM-TV, began a bold experiment in local television news: it unveiled a 10 p.m. program that presented its audience with plain old news and information. Gone was the genre's usual reliance on sensationalism and entertainment-world gossip.</p>
        <p>The anchor was Carol Marin, who quit her job at the local NBC station, WMAQ, two years earlier, when it hired Jerry Springer as a news commentator. ''No water-skiing squirrels'' became the mantra of the program's staff, who were enthusiastic about the new approach. So were the station's executives, especially Pat Costello, the news director, and Hank Price, the station's general manager.</p>

        <p>Last February, the CBS station in Chicago, WBBM-TV, began a bold experiment in local television news: it unveiled a 10 p.m. program that presented its audience with plain old news and information. Gone was the genre's usual reliance on sensationalism and entertainment-world gossip.</p>
        <p>The anchor was Carol Marin, who quit her job at the local NBC station, WMAQ, two years earlier, when it hired Jerry Springer as a news commentator. ''No water-skiing squirrels'' became the mantra of the program's staff, who were enthusiastic about the new approach. So were the station's executives, especially Pat Costello, the news director, and Hank Price, the station's general manager.</p>
        <p>But ''The 10 p.m. News With Carol Marin'' has done worse in the ratings than the program that it had replaced. And, given recent events, its once bright-eyed staff members privately are worried about its future.</p>
        <p>This summer, Mr. Price and Mr. Costello left WBBM, citing opportunities at other stations that they could not pass up. It is unclear who will take Mr. Costello's place as news director at WBBM.</p>
        <p>Joel Cheatwood, who was the vice president for news at the NBC station when Ms. Marin left in protest, is now in charge of news for the 35 TV stations CBS owns around the country. People at the station say Mr. Cheatwood could have at least some say in selecting the new news director.</p>
        <p>The new station manager, Walter F. DeHaven Jr., has said that he hoped Ms. Marin's newscast will catch on with viewers but that the ratings will have to come up soon. He had no comment last week.</p>
