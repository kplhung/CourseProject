        <p>REMEMBER those grainy commercials that showed a white-haired actor portraying a brokerage executive that many people mistook for the real Dean Witter? Well, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Company wants you to forget them.</p>
        <p>Morgan Stanley Dean Witter may still measure success one investor at a time, but the firm has a more urgent message for investors in the Internet age: ''Move your money.'' In a new ad campaign coming this week to newspapers, magazine and TV screens, Morgan Stanley's brokerage unit is dropping the slogan it has used for more than a decade and is centering its $150 million advertising budget on a bolder, blunter approach.</p>
        <p>Under the theme ''Well connected,'' the ads take dead aim at the electronic brokerages that have flooded the airwaves with pitches for stock trading at discounted prices. They equate online brokerages with con men and depict investors being led by them onto paths that dead end in the woods.</p>
        <p>''This is a departure from some of the ethereal, aspirational images out there,'' said Bob Sloss, the firm's executive vice president for brokerage marketing. Mr. Sloss said the firm's research showed that consumers recalled the ads of traditional brokerage firms but had trouble distinguishing among their messages.</p>
        <p>Until the Internet came along and spawned a new breed of competitors, most brokerage firms relied on images of trust and wisdom. In the 1980's, Dean Witter briefly used the slogan, ''You look like you just heard from Dean Witter.'' while a defunct competitor used ''When E. F. Hutton speaks, people listen.''</p>
        <p>That sameness was shattered in the late 1990's by big-spending newcomers, like the E*Trade Group and Ameritrade Holdings. Those electronic brokers built their brands with irreverent ads mocking stock brokers and treating stock trading like a sport.</p>
        <p>Even Morgan Stanley Dean Witter joined in the fun. Two years ago, it ran a separate online brokerage operation named Discover Brokerage Direct, after the firm's Discover credit card. Discover Brokerage ran a pair of popular TV ads that depicted a truck driver who had bought his own island with his stock-trading profits and a teenager who had his own helicopter.</p>
        <p>Those ads incurred the wrath of Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Levitt said they were inappropriate and could create false expectations of instant riches among small investors, and the commission began scrutinizing online brokerage ads. (Last week, E*Trade, which has been sued for deceptive advertising, disclosed that regulators were screening its ads before they were published or broadcast.)</p>
        <p>''We saw that, and we definitely addressed that head-on,'' Mr. Sloss said, referring to the regulators' displeasure.</p>
        <p>Last year, after a rival securities firm, Merrill Lynch, announced that it would offer online trading, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter folded Discover Brokerage into its traditional brokerage operation and renamed it Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online. The first ads for the renamed unit struck a decidedly more conservative tone, cautioning investors to ''know your source'' of stock tips.</p>
        <p>The new ads, led by one bearing the headline ''Life's not fair,'' tell investors that there are no shortcuts to investment success. The ads lay out the resources the firm has that the upstarts do not, like proprietary stock research and a high ranking as an underwriter of technology stocks.</p>
        <p>''We think we can repatriate some of that group of investors who thought that full-service brokers could not meet their needs,'' Mr. Sloss said.</p>
        <p>To that end, some ads show a younger and more diverse group of faces than usually appear in ads for Wall Street firms. But the mood is not as upbeat as in a spot for, say,  Gap khakis.</p>
        <p>''We're not mollycoddling people,'' said Jeff Finkler, executive creative director at Leo Burnett U.S.A., a unit of B Com3 , in Chicago, which created the ads. ''We're going to be very blunt. Nowhere is there a vague promise of some promised land.''</p>
        <p>Also absent is any glimpse of a Dean Witter broker, a marked contrast to the TV and print ads Merrill Lynch started running this year. Merrill's ads profile particular brokers and clients to emphasize that providing advice to individuals and small businesses is the heart of its brokerage business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sloss said that the brokers will get more attention after the first round of ads in the campaign. He described the ''Well connected'' theme as a ''platform'' that could be part of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's advertising for years to come, as the firm evolves and incorporates new technology, such as access to its services from cellular phones and other wireless devices.</p>
        <p>Still, the firm is taking a risk in shifting away from a tried-and-true advertising formula, said Bruce Brittain, president of Brittain Associates, a marketing consulting firm in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Consumers tend to think of Dean Witter before most other financial-services companies ''because of their longstanding campaign which stuck with a particular theme,'' he said. ''It's very well known and highly associative. If they do walk away from that, I think they're giving up a lot.''</p>
        <p>The long-running ads with an actor playing a brokerage chief became so ingrained in the popular consciousness that they were the object of a classic parody on ''Saturday Night Live.'' Even Mr. Finkler seemed to have been flattered by the imitation, which he called ''hilarious.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sloss said the firm intended to work the ''one investor at a time'' line into some of the new ads. More than 10 print ads have been created to promote different aspects of the firm's business to different audiences. The headline on one is ''Hear the word on the street before it's on the street.'' Another reads: ''The new old boys club. Less old. Less boys.''</p>
        <p>The TV ads will make their debut next weekend during the broadcast of the U.S. Open tennis tournament, Mr. Sloss said.</p>
