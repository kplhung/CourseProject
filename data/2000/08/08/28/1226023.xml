        <p>Sleep did not come easily to Yuri Narinesingh the last few days. He was used to a bed, not the ragged gray rug spread out above a sidewalk in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Then there were the dozens of steel oil drums lining the block to worry about.</p>
        <p>They were sorted into groups of half a dozen or so each and lashed to metal frames that could be rolled up and down the block, like coat racks. Each morning, Mr. Narinesingh counted the drums when he woke up. One stolen here, another misplaced there could spell disaster for his 75-member band, the Nu Tunes.</p>
        <p>''All this for the sake of music, just music,'' said Mr. Narinesingh, who had not shaved or showered in days while he was guarding the drums.</p>
        <p>This week was supposed to cap a march to glory for the band. The group is scheduled to compete with 12 other steel drum bands for thousands of dollars in prizes on the Saturday before Brooklyn's giant West Indian American Carnival, which is expected to draw more than two million people. The competition, called Panorama, is one of the premier contests for pan music, a variant of calypso played on converted oil drums.</p>
        <p>But the Nu Tunes, along with two other pan bands called the Pan Rebels and the Metro Steel Orchestra, now find themselves literally out on the street. On Aug. 16, they were forced from a warehouse at 680 Parkside Avenue where they had stored their instruments and rehearsed for several years. So the three bands have been doing a bit of sidewalk improvising ever since.</p>
        <p>Through rainstorms and sweltering heat, they have kept their drums on the pavement right outside the building, rehearsed there and even held round-the-clock vigils on the industrial block to watch over the instruments. The thunderous rehearsals, which draw hundreds of band members and residents, have also perked up the ears of police officers, who have dropped by every night to keep an eye on things.</p>
        <p>Local politicians said they were trying to find another space or help in negotiations with the landlord, but have come up empty-handed.</p>
        <p>The bands had never signed a lease or paid rent for the warehouse, and the landlord, Klyn Properties, did not know they were there, said Stephan B. Gleich, a lawyer representing Klyn. Mr. Gleich said that several months ago, he heard there were bands in the warehouse and asked the police to look into the matter.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 16, police officers descended on the warehouse and arrested Tony Joseph, the leader of the Metro Steel Orchestra, on a trespassing charge. They led him away in handcuffs to spend the night in jail and told the other bands to leave the building.</p>
        <p>Over the next two days, fire marshals and inspectors from the Department of Buildings dropped by to look at the warehouse. They cited a faulty roof and issued an order preventing anyone from using the building. The bands and all their equipment were out on the pavement.</p>
        <p>This was no way for anyone to live, said Mr. Narinesingh, who usually sleeps in his apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Lounging on a peeling vinyl couch on the sidewalk, he scratched at his beard. The stench of urine wafted through the air. The musicians no longer had use of the warehouse bathrooms.</p>
        <p>''This is so embarrassing,'' Mr. Narinesingh said, a pair of welder's goggles on his forehead, his T-shirt and khaki pants covered in black grime. ''We're just simple people playing music, taking part in our own culture. It's not a crime.''</p>
        <p>The band members, who range from 6-year-old girls to 60-year-old men, fear the humiliation that may come when world-class music arrangers arrive this week from Trinidad and Tobago and see them out on the street. Two of the bands have paid thousands of dollars to fly the arrangers over to help pull together calypso favorites. But the show must go on, particularly since the Brooklyn festival is one of the main showcases of the music, along with Trinidad's annual Carnival in February.</p>
        <p>''I'm very disappointed with what's happening,'' said Carlos Lezama, president of the West Indian American Day Carnival Association. ''But regardless of what the situation is, these fellows will come out for Panorama. Practice or no practice, they will be there.''</p>
        <p>Pan music took root in the Caribbean during World War II, when aircraft carriers used Trinidad as a refueling stop. Because African drums were banned by British colonial officials in 1884, the islanders were used to finding ways of improvising carnival music. They created a new kind of sound by hammering dents into the tops of empty oil barrels, converting them into drums.</p>
        <p>The bands, which can easily number more than 100 people, achieve a wide range of sounds by pounding tenor pans that carry the melody and bass pans for the deep notes.</p>
        <p>Panorama, which is performed in a lot behind the Brooklyn Museum of Art, is one of the most respected pan music competitions in the world. The day after the bands battle it out, they march in a parade called Jouvert (pronounced joo-VAY), ushering in the massive and brightly costumed carnival that winds down Eastern Parkway on Labor Day. Although the festival is usually a joyous event, it was marred last year by three accidental deaths, which led the city to ban alcohol sales at large parades.</p>
        <p>Preparation for the pan competition begins early in the year, culminating in furious rehearsals during the summer. Bands throughout the city often use empty lots for that purpose, converting them into what are called panyards. Before this summer, the three bands on Parkside Avenue practiced both in and outside the warehouse.</p>
        <p>Last week, Edward Roberts, a lawyer representing two of the bands, filed a request for a temporary injunction in Federal District Court in Brooklyn asking the landlord to let the bands back into the warehouse until Labor Day. A hearing is scheduled for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>But Dawad Philip, a manager for Pan Rebels, admitted the bands did not have ''a legal leg to stand on in terms of tenant-landlord relations.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the bands have been pushing forward with their daily rehearsals despite lack of sleep and the occasional rainfall. Pankey Abdool, a float designer for the Metro Steel Orchestra, held up a tenor drum and pointed out patches of rust. Such drums are worth up to $1,000 apiece, he said. The Pan Rebels are storing their more delicate equipment, like guitars, in parked vans.</p>
        <p>The three bands rehearse from 9 p.m. until 2 a.m., when the police close down the session. Although there have been no complaints about noise on the industrial block, some officials at Intermediate School 2, across the street, have asked band members not to urinate on the side of the school, Mr. Philip said.</p>
        <p>Despite the headaches, the band members have tried to remain as upbeat as their calypso standards.</p>
        <p>''We live for the competition,'' Mr. Philip said. ''Will we be as strong as previous years? That remains to be seen. But we believe the gods are with us.''</p>
