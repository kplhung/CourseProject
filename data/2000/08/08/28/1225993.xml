        <p>VINCENT LA SELVA, the artistic director of the New York Grand Opera Company, often answers the telephone himself in the company's Carnegie Hall office. For several years, he's been noting some of the questions posed about the company's summer season of free opera in Central Park. Here are a few he especially enjoyed from this year's batch:</p>

        <p>VINCENT LA SELVA, the artistic director of the New York Grand Opera Company, often answers the telephone himself in the company's Carnegie Hall office. For several years, he's been noting some of the questions posed about the company's summer season of free opera in Central Park. Here are a few he especially enjoyed from this year's batch:</p>
        <p>''Can you get a reserved seat in the unreserved section?''</p>
        <p>''How can I be sure to get a seat if they are all taken?''</p>
        <p>''How can I buy a subscription for the free opera?''</p>
        <p>''When do you decide if it's going to rain or not?''</p>
        <p>''Who wrote the music for Verdi's 'Don Carlos'?''</p>
        <p>''Will I be able to get out of the park when the opera is over?''</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>They're not like us out there!</p>
        <p>I was visiting my son in Sacramento and joined him on a trip to his bank. Most of the transactions with the customers seemed to take some time. Finally it was my son's turn, and the teller greeted him: ''Hi, Rick, how are the dogs? Last week, Suzie told me one of them was sick. And by the way, how was that meat loaf recipe I gave Suzie?''</p>
        <p>Rick stood there and chatted with her, oblivious to the line that continued to form behind him.</p>
        <p>I stood there and thought: ''GIVE HIM THE MONEY. JUST GIVE HIM THE MONEY!''</p>

        <p>Ted Hardin telephoned a neighborhood restaurant and ordered a simple salad of just lettuce and tomatoes to accompany his spaghetti. He paid for it and discovered when he sat down to eat that the salad was brimming with olives, mushrooms, onions, peppers, nuts and carrots. Incensed, he dialed the restaurant and told them in no uncertain terms to immediately send up the plain lettuce and tomato salad he had ordered. When it was delivered, he shoved the first salad in the delivery man's hands and made a snide remark about incompetence. He noted that the second delivery man was better dressed than the first one and that the salad came in a different container.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, he realized that he had mistakenly dialed another neighborhood restaurant, and as confused as they undoubtedly must have been, they nevertheless sent up the salad he said he had ordered.</p>
        <p>REGRETS</p>
        <p>We beat ourselves for these --</p>
        <p>All the ''should'ves.''</p>
        <p>I should've said this.</p>
        <p>I should've done that.</p>
        <p>And the judgments --</p>
        <p>She should've said this.</p>
        <p>He should've done that.</p>
        <p>I will dwell no longer</p>
        <p>in the land of Should'ves.</p>
        <p>I haven't the energy.</p>
        <p>I haven't the time.</p>
        <p>Am I happy with this poem?</p>
        <p>I should've written something different.</p>

        <p>Scene: David B. Kriser Dental Center at the New York University College of Dentistry on East 24th Street.</p>
        <p>Cast: Elderly couple, brother and sister.</p>
        <p>Observer: Rowann Gilman.</p>
        <p>Action: Man filling out clipboard questionnaire for his sister.</p>
        <p>He: ''Heart disease. I'm putting 'no.' Right?''</p>
        <p>She: ''Right.''</p>
        <p>He: ''Dry mouth? 'No,' right?''</p>
        <p>She: ''Right.''</p>
        <p>He: ''Halitosis. You know, bad breath. No bad breath, right?''</p>
        <p>She: ''Well, maybe.''</p>
        <p>He: ''No, you don't have bad breath.''</p>
        <p>She: ''I don't? So where did all my friends go?''</p>
        <p>Who remembers the ''Who's on First'' dialogue between Abbott and Costello, asks Camille Lavington. She was in a new D'Agostino market that had sent out coupons for complimentary items when she heard this exchange between a distinguished looking older gentleman and a disinterested checker.</p>
        <p>Gentleman: ''I've come for my orange juice.''</p>
        <p>Checker: ''What orange juice? We've got lots of orange juice.''</p>
        <p>Gentleman: ''The orange juice that Mr. D'Agostino invited me to have.''</p>
        <p>Checker: ''What orange juice are you talking about? We stock orange juice from several places at different prices.''</p>
        <p>Gentleman: ''I don't care where it comes from or what it costs. Mr. D'Agostino invited me to have free freshly squeezed orange juice.''</p>
        <p>Checker: ''What do you mean FREE?''</p>
        <p>Gentleman: ''Yes, free freshly squeezed orange juice.''</p>
        <p>Checker, giving up: ''Somebody get this man some freshly squeezed orange juice.''</p>
        <p>Checker: ''Here's your orange juice.''</p>
        <p>Gentleman: ''Where's the straw?''</p>
        <p>Checker: ''Somebody bring him a straw. Anything else?''</p>
        <p>Gentleman: ''Yes, where's the chair to sit on to enjoy my orange juice?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lavington was leaving the store at this point, obviously amused. The gentleman winked at her. He knew she remembered Abbott and Costello.</p>
        <p>Masha Wise Woolwich was seated in the front of a Fifth Avenue bus facing a little girl of perhaps 8 or 9, who was flanked by her two grandmothers.</p>
        <p>''I had such a wonderful time at lunch with your lady friends,'' the little girl said. ''And the museum and tea at the Plaza. Thank you, thank you for such a wonderful day of adultery.''</p>
        <p>Cell phone conversations are irritating at least every second bus passenger, according to an unscientific survey of reactions in letters and telephone calls. Florrie Chiat was on a 57th Street crosstown bus when a cell phone rang and the owner, in a loud voice, proceeded to share her ''business'' conversation with her unhappy fellow riders. Finally a man, also in a loud voice, suggested everyone join him in singing, which they did.</p>
        <p>The phone user was oblivious, continuing to share her business with the rest of the bus. Another passenger then piped up. He suggested that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority should have two rates, one for true passengers and another for passengers using the bus as an office.</p>
        <p>That one worked.</p>
        <p>The call ended.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>After arriving on the Long Island Rail Road at Pennsylvania Station, we hailed a taxi and en route mentioned that after the theater we would be returning to Long Island. The driver told us that he lived in an adjacent town on the island and that he, too, would be going out there about midnight. We rejected his suggestion that we hire his taxi for the return trip as too expensive. He then replied he hated to drive alone and offered to meet us outside the theater and drive us home as his guests.</p>
        <p>We agreed to meet him after the curtain fell, but never expected that he would be there. To our surprise, he was. We were four passengers, and I sat in front with him and discovered that he was from Kiev in Ukraine, the same city from which my father had emigrated almost 100 years ago. We spent a delightful hour singing Russian and Jewish folk songs, and when we arrived at our destination tipped him well: what our railroad fare would have cost.</p>
        <p>I thought then that here was an ordinary New Yorker, a man who defied the cold, abrasive, impersonal image. A man with the same dreams and ambitions that my father had a century ago.</p>
