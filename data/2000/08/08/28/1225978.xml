        <p>How many applications dance on the head of a hard drive?</p>
        <p>In his antitrust ruling against Microsoft, federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson argued that a crucial barrier confronting the company's potential competitors are the 70,000 programs written to run solely on the Windows operating system.</p>
        <p>The judge made his ruling, in April, based on trial testimony about the number of Windows programs -- testimony that was not disputed by Microsoft. The judge concluded that the vast library of Windows-based programs discourage competitors and make the possibility of competing against Microsoft impractical. At issue are so-called application programs -- word processors, spreadsheets, personal-finance software and the like -- that run on top of the Windows operating system.</p>
        <p>But an economist who has surveyed the personal computer software market contends that the 70,000 figure is grossly overstated. There are probably fewer than 10,000 Windows programs in use today and most users probably have no more than a handful on their computers, according to the economist, Richard B. McKenzie, a conservative scholar  at the University of California at Irvine.</p>
        <p>The lower figure indicates that Microsoft is not the impregnable fortress depicted in the antitrust trial, Mr. McKenzie writes in a paper that presents the results of his survey.</p>
        <p>The paper is to be published this week by the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group based in Washington. Mr. McKenzie also recently published ''Trust on Trial: How the Microsoft Case Is Reframing the Rules of Competition,'' a book that attacks the Justice Department's antitrust case.</p>
        <p>In his paper, Mr. McKenzie contends that Microsoft may have contributed to the misconception when it claimed in marketing and advertising materials in 1997 that as many as 100,000 programs existed for the Windows operating system.</p>
        <p>''It seems that their marketing behavior has come back to bite  them,'' Mr. McKenzie said in an interview.</p>
        <p>He said he had embarked on his research after failing to find any documentation to support a contention made during the trial by John Rose, a Compaq Computer executive and Microsoft witness, that the 70,000 applications were the reason that Compaq shipped Windows with its computers.</p>
        <p>''I was shocked,'' by the claim, Mr. McKenzie recalled. After failing to find documentation for the claim and conducting a survey, he said he asked the company why it had not challenged the figure.</p>
        <p>He said Microsoft executives told him that they did not wish to undermine the credibility of their witness. ''They were between a rock and a hard place,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The 70,000 figure might actually represent the number of applications that have been written during the entire history of the personal computer industry, he said. Or it may be an exaggeration based on the fact that many software programs go through multiple versions during their life spans.</p>
        <p>''Amazon lists only 8,301 'software programs' under its productivity software categories,'' Mr. McKenzie writes in his paper, titled ''Microsoft's Applications Barrier to Entry: The Missing 70,000 Programs.''</p>
        <p>''That is a large number,'' the paper continues, ''but it counts programs written for all available operating systems, including Red Hat Linux, IBM OS/2, and Apple Mac, as well as Microsoft Windows. Many of the software programs are also listed several times in the various subcategories.''</p>
        <p>A Microsoft spokesman said that, despite Mr. McKenzie's analysis, the company believed that the larger number cited by the Compaq witness and by the judge were accurate.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenzie draws a different lesson. Because there are actually only a few crucial programs used by most PC users -- like Microsoft Office -- the company's applications business, he said, should be vulnerable to a program like StarOffice,  which is being distributed free by Sun Microsystems.</p>
