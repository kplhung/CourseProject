      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on announcement by Gen Pervez Musharraf of plans for a new political system in Pakistan, designed to buttress his own power by excluding country's top politicians; says Musharraf should acknowledge that country's problems have only been worsening under military rule and accelerate return to democracy</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Last October, Gen. Pervez Musharraf overthrew Pakistan's democracy, promising to eradicate corruption, revive the economy and open the way for ''true democracy.'' He pledged to restrain nuclear weapons development and pursue peaceful diplomacy with India. Ten months later, he has made little progress with the economy or corruption and has put off the return of democracy until at least 2003. Pakistan still has not signed the nuclear test ban treaty and tensions with India over Kashmir are as dangerous as ever. Now General Musharraf has announced plans for a new political system designed to buttress his own power by excluding the country's top politicians. That would compound Pakistan's problems. A speedier timetable for restoring democracy is urgently needed.</p>
        <p>Pakistan's democratic governments have been flawed. But its military dictatorships have blighted its economic and political development and gravely damaged its international reputation. General Musharraf's administration has proved no different. Military rulers claim they can push through reforms because they do not have to make deals with entrenched political interests. But they are beholden to Pakistan's single most powerful interest group, the military and its related intelligence services. Military spending absorbs more than a quarter of Pakistan's yearly budget, diverting resources needed for education and development.</p>

        <p>Pakistan's democratic governments have been flawed. But its military dictatorships have blighted its economic and political development and gravely damaged its international reputation. General Musharraf's administration has proved no different. Military rulers claim they can push through reforms because they do not have to make deals with entrenched political interests. But they are beholden to Pakistan's single most powerful interest group, the military and its related intelligence services. Military spending absorbs more than a quarter of Pakistan's yearly budget, diverting resources needed for education and development.</p>
        <p>When President Clinton visited Pakistan in February, he made clear America's unhappiness with military rule and with General Musharraf's refusal to cut ties with terrorist groups in Kashmir and Afghanistan. Over the weekend, Don McKinnon, secretary general of the Commonwealth, delivered a similar message. The International Monetary Fund is also unhappy with the slow pace of promised economic reforms. General Musharraf should acknowledge that he is worsening Pakistan's problems and accelerate the return to democratic rule.</p>
