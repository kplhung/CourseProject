        <p>Vice President Al Gore attacked Gov. George W. Bush on health care policy yesterday, using a telephone interview to reiterate his own proposals in detail and to mock his opponent's positions as lacking ''a minimal standard of substance for serious debate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's comments came on a day when each campaign dispatched a surrogate to attack the other's positions on health policy, and when Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, acknowledged in two television interviews that Mr. Bush did not yet have a detailed plan for financing a prescription drug benefit for the elderly. Providing such a benefit under Medicare, at a cost estimated at $253 billion over 10 years, is a centerpiece of Mr. Gore's platform.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's interview on health care, initiated by his campaign, elaborated on a theme that he plans to address throughout a four-day trip this week. It was a clear attempt to keep the campaign's agenda firmly on Democratic turf and to push Mr. Bush further on the defensive after a rocky week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush plans to spend the week talking about education on a six-state tour that begins today. He had hoped to do the same last week, but wound up devoting much of his time to defending his tax cut plan from daily criticism by the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Gore have made it clear that they believe health care is a winning issue for the vice president. Recent polls have given Mr. Gore an overwhelming advantage when voters were asked which candidate would do a better job dealing with health care in general and with prescription drug prices in particular.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and his aides also have used health care to highlight the risks they see in Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 billion, 10-year reduction in income tax rates, which they claim would leave little of the federal surplus for new spending programs. And because Mr. Gore focused much of his attention on health care during his 16 years in the House and the Senate, the Gore campaign views health policy as an issue that can reinforce the notion that Mr. Gore is more knowledgeable and better prepared than Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>In the telephone interview, Mr. Gore used several similar constructions to question Mr. Bush's seriousness. ''What's good for the American people is to have an adult, intelligent discussion of the specifics of these issues,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Also in the interview, conducted from his residence in Washington, Mr. Gore criticized recent television advertisements by the Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee. The Bush advertisement, which began airing late last week, said that Mr. Bush, the governor of Texas, would ''make prescription drugs available and affordable for every senior who needs them,'' while the party's commercial accused Mr. Gore of ''pushing a big government plan that lets Washington bureaucrats interfere with what your doctor prescribes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore scoffed at those claims. ''We need to honor our democracy and redeem the promise of the American system and not hide behind glib television advertising that disguises what really's been proposed,'' he said. ''I'm waiting for the plan. The ad says there's a plan. Where is the plan?''</p>
        <p>The vice president has proposed a prescription drug benefit that would  pay all drug costs for the approximately 13 million uncovered Medicare recipients with incomes of 135 percent of the poverty level and below. That would cover individuals making about $12,000 a year and couples making about $14,000 a year, Gore aides said. Those with higher incomes would pay half of the cost of their drugs up to $5,000 and then would pay nothing more once they had spent $4,000 of their own money in a given year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, said his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, would ''build on'' a plan devised by a bipartisan commission headed by Senators Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, and John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana.</p>
        <p>That plan would seek to spur competition between public and private health insurance plans for Medicare recipients, giving consumers a choice of public and private plans, some of which would provide a prescription drug benefit. Mr. Bush also has said he supports a sliding prescription drug subsidy for the low-income elderly, but would leave exact amounts to be determined in negotiations with Congress, Mr. Fleischer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer and other Bush aides have said that the governor's plan for paying for prescription drugs would not cost the federal government any money because other reforms to the Medicare system would save enough to pay for the drug coverage.</p>
        <p>When asked yesterday about the details of the Republican plan on ABC's ''This Week,'' Mr. Cheney said that ''the specifics are being worked on right now.''</p>
        <p>''It's a high priority for us,'' Mr. Cheney said, ''and we will shortly have the details of a proposal to lay out on the campaign.''</p>
        <p>On NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Cheney said the current lack of a prescription drug benefit was the result of the Clinton administration's failure to make needed changes in Medicare.</p>
        <p>''This administration's been there for seven and a half years and hasn't dealt with it or addressed it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Asked in the interview to address the Clinton administration's inability to pass a universal health care plan in its first two years, Mr. Gore said, ''Well, first of all, this campaign is about the future and not the past.'' He later cited the creation of the Children's Health Insurance Program, which has, since its passage in 1997, provided health care coverage for about 2 million children. About 11 million children remain uninsured out of 44 million total uninsured in the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also noted the administration's efforts to extend the solvency of Medicare and the Kassebaum-Kennedy law that made it easier to maintain health insurance after changing employers.</p>
        <p>But he acknowledged some disappointment in the failures of the administration's early years.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, we wanted to do more in the first two years and that was not to be,'' he said. And then the Republican takeover of Congress ''made it hard to follow up with second efforts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he did not think it was risky for a Democratic candidate to place such a heavy emphasis on health policy in light of his own administration's troubled record.</p>
        <p>''I think the need is so obvious and so great that people expect a well thought out plan,'' he said. But he said that ''one of the lessons that comes out of the 1990's is that we should go step-by-step instead of trying to cover everybody in one fell swoop.''</p>
        <p>The vice president said he would begin that process by expanding the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid to provide coverage for all children by 2005. In all, Mr. Gore would spend more than $500 billion over 10 years on health care initiatives, about one of every three dollars available from the surplus.</p>
        <p>Early this afternoon, the Gore campaign put Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, on a conference call with reporters to promote the vice president's health care plans. Several hours later, the Bush campaign responded by making Mr. Frist available for a conference call.</p>
        <p>He derided Mr. Gore's prescription drug proposal as a ''one-size-fits-all'' government plan whose benefit to the elderly, after premiums and copayments, would amount to only 13 cents a day.</p>
        <p>''Seniors won't have the wool pulled over their eyes,'' he said. ''They clearly won't get what's being advertised by Vice President Gore.''</p>
        <p>Two hours earlier, the Bush campaign had issued a news release claiming that the benefit would amount to only 5 cents a day, but changed the number after a recalculation, Mr. Fleischer said.</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Gore emphasized that his prescription drug plan ''covers every senior, and I have budgeted for it, spelled out the cost, and fit it within a balanced budget.''</p>
        <p>He said that Mr. Bush's plan ''for providing a tiny drug subsidy to insurance companies'' would not work because the premiums needed to cover drug costs would remain unaffordable for many seniors.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Gore has repeatedly blamed the pharmaceutical and insurance industries for driving up drug costs and limiting access to coverage.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, he said he was not bothered by the fact that his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, had taken substantial campaign contributions from those industries.</p>
        <p>''He has voted on high-profile matters against the wishes of the big pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The fact that many of them are headquartered in his state and have supported him is not of concern to me in any way to me.''</p>
