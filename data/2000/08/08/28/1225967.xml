        <p>FOR generations, urban commuters have stood on curbs in every kind of weather, doing the same dance: bodies tilted, necks craned and eyes scanning the traffic horizon to see if the bus is coming.</p>
        <p>Now there is an invention that could end those contortions.</p>
        <p>Paul Freda and Kenneth Schmier, who live in San Francisco, have patented a system that uses orbital satellites, global positioning technology, computer networks and wireless communications to pinpoint buses along their routes and transmit the locations to the public.</p>
        <p>Buses would be equipped with global positioning sensors. Each sensor would relay the location of its bus to a central computer, where the information would be collected, updated and added to data on every other bus in a transit system. The computer would create a table showing the status of each bus, the location of scheduled stops, connections to other buses, and the computed arrival times of each bus at the stops along its route.</p>
        <p>Riders waiting for a bus could check this data a number of ways -- through wireless communications devices like pagers, notebook computers, personal digital assistants or cell phones; on a desktop computer; or at special display stations.</p>
        <p>Anyone downloading the bus information would have advertisements, too, and news, the inventors said in their patent filing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freda and Mr. Schmier received patent 6,006,159.</p>
        <p>If taking the bus seems too prosaic, there are transportation alternatives. An airship with sails, for example, or an amphibious bicycle. Both won patents this year.</p>
        <p>Joab Jay Perdue, who lives in Amarillo, Tex., has designed a bicycle with pontoons that keeps riders afloat and dry while they peddle across a lake, river, creek or pond.</p>
        <p>The bike has four braces that attach to its frame, each one a tripod. The braces could be made of aluminum, metal alloy or plastic. They are attached to the bike at points like the rear wheel axle, the seat post, the seat-to-fork support bar and the pedal assembly. Two flat pontoons made of a dense compression polystyrene, like Styrofoam, are fastened to the bike with a pair of the braces. Using two braces for each pontoon allows the rider to raise and lower the pontoons between upper and lower braces. The lower position allows the bicycle to float on water, while the upper position moves the pontoons out of the way for cycling on land.</p>
        <p>Moveable cross braces swing under the bike to create a support bracket between the pontoons. Plastic or metal paddles are attached to the spokes of the bicycle's rear wheel. They do not interfere with the bike's function on land, but in the water they serve to row the bike forward as the rider pedals. In the lowered position, the flat, wide pontoons would keep the bicycle stable and elevated, so a rider could pedal without becoming wet, Mr. Perdue said.</p>
        <p>The pontoons could be made in varying sizes, depending on the size and weight of the bicycle, but Mr. Perdue described a typical pontoon as being two feet wide, eight feet long and three inches thick. He wrote in his patent application that a pontoon should be constructed of polystyrene to ''take the puncture factor out of its ability to float.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Perdue also wrote that the frame and pontoons held up well over rough terrain in a prototype bicycle he rode on land and were stable in waves of up to two feet. He received patent 6,050,864.</p>
        <p>The problem with most dirigibles, as Christopher Thyen sees it, is that passengers are stuck in a compartment and cannot enjoy the view and fresh air. So his patented airship with sails would be shaped like a boat with a flat upper deck so that passengers and crew could mill around outside in flight.</p>
        <p>''The sense of freedom one receives on the deck of a sailing ship, or from the unenclosed confines of a basket of a hot air balloon, are missing from the gondolas used on airships,'' Mr. Thyen wrote in his patent filing.</p>
        <p>Airships are designed to fly at low altitudes, where there are strong winds, Mr. Thyen added, but modern models like the blimp ignore this and rely on engines. Mr. Thyen has designed his airship to work like a sailboat.</p>
        <p>It would even resemble one. The frame is shaped like a boat, with a curved bottom, a bow and stern, and a flat deck. The lower part of the frame can be covered with any kind of fabric, and is filled with seven ''flexible gas cells or lifting bladders'' carrying helium. The ship also has a wing on each side, with horizontal stabilizers that have pivotal flaps on the trailing edges to help keep the plane level and control its ascent and descent.</p>
        <p>Passengers and crew sit in an enclosed compartment during takeoff and landing. The compartment might be several stories high and could include sleeping cabins and a galley. A vertical stabilizer with a rudder would be placed behind the compartment.</p>
        <p>Forty-foot masts rising from the deck would carry sails. The sails, along with other conventional sailboat hardware like trailing booms, spar lines, winches and ballast tanks, allow the crew to catch the wind for propulsion.</p>
        <p>If there is no wind, the ship can be flown with turbofan engines attached to each side. Once airborne, passengers can leave the compartment and stroll along the upper deck. An encircling rail would keep them from falling overboard. Mr. Thyen received patent 6,019,311.</p>
