        <p>DaimlerChrysler plans to announce on Monday that it will nearly double production in Alabama, adding another assembly line close to the site where it already builds M-Class sport utility vehicles, auto industry officials and consultants said over the weekend.</p>
        <p>The Mercedes-Benz unit of DaimlerChrysler said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday in Tuscaloosa, Ala., the nearest large city to its sport utility vehicle factory in Vance. The planned construction project is the latest sign that Alabama's auto industry is growing. Honda has just begun building a minivan factory near Vance, too.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler declined to comment on what the factory would produce. But auto industry consultants working for automakers and auto parts suppliers said that the company would make a so-called crossover vehicle that would combine the features of a minivan and the M-Class sport utility vehicle.</p>
        <p>Whether the planned Mercedes project represents a new assembly plant or an expansion of the existing one will likely be the subject of some debate. State officials in Alabama began praising the project on Friday as a new plant. But there is no consensus among automakers over whether adding a second assembly line represents a second plant or an expansion of an existing one.</p>
        <p>Because the second assembly line will produce a vehicle similar to the M-Class, it is likely to work closely with the existing assembly plant and receive shipments of many of the same parts. ''I'd put it more in terms of expansion'' of the existing factory, rather than a second, independent assembly plant, said an auto industry manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The Birmingham News reported that Mercedes would receive $150 million in state incentives for the new operation and that it would create 1,750 jobs. Mercedes received $235 million in incentives for the existing factory.</p>
        <p>It will be to DaimlerChrysler's advantage to portray the new operation as an entire assembly plant to people in Alabama, where the company has been seeking tax breaks and other assistance, while portraying it in Michigan as an expansion of the existing operation. The United Automobile Workers union, which represents workers of the former Chrysler Corporation, has been unable to organize workers at the factory in Vance, and there is considerable nervousness among workers and state officials in Michigan about the pace of automakers' expansion in the South.</p>
        <p>The U.A.W. declined today to comment on DaimlerChrysler's plans. Although DaimlerChrysler has publicly declared its neutrality on the question of whether the current assembly plant should be organized, union officials have complained over the last year that the company has remained hostile. Local businesses in the Vance area have tried to rally factory workers against the U.A.W., fearing that if the union is successful, that might discourage further investment in the area. The U.A.W. has not insisted on an actual vote at the factory on whether to unionize, fearing that it might lose.</p>
        <p>Michael E. Robinet, the director of forecast services at CSM Worldwide, a big auto production consulting firm based in Northville, Mich., said over the weekend that Mercedes would change the M-Class sport utility vehicle considerably several years from now and then use the underbody from the new model to build a similar vehicle at an adjacent site.</p>
        <p>The current M-Class uses a stiff, heavy underbody like that of a pickup truck, which made it cheap to develop but also gives a bumpy ride. Mr. Robinet said that Mercedes would switch to a lighter, car-like underbody for the next generation of M-Class vehicles.</p>
        <p>Automakers are increasingly combining the features of sport utility vehicles with those of cars and minivans, using car-like underbodies for better handling, fuel economy and safety. Examples include the Lexus RX-300 sport utility vehicle and the new Pontiac Aztek and Ford Escape. Because these vehicles still look mostly like sport utilities on the outside, automakers have been successful, with few exceptions, in persuading regulators that these crossover vehicles are still eligible for the more lenient safety, air pollution and fuel economy standards that apply to light trucks, instead of the more stringent standards applied to cars.</p>
