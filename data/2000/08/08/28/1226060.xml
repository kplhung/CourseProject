        <p>A sedan slithered through the traffic down Broadway on an indelicate approach to Times Square. In the face of the halogen spectacle, the passenger, Marat Safin, snapped out of his groggy state, flung open his eyes like shutters and absorbed the plunge into a mosh pit of celebrity.</p>
        <p>Surrounding Safin, a 20-year-old Russian, were models on billboards jostling with morning-show icons pictured on big screens above the street and blown-up sitcom stars bumping against an MTV set where squealing teenagers wave at rock stars.</p>
        <p>Not long after his passage through America's addiction to pop culture, Safin was amazed -- and a little amused. Although he has J. Crew good looks to go with his No. 6 seeding at the United States Open, Safin is from a country where he moves without notice from restaurants to discos and from shops to airports.</p>
        <p>''In Russia, people don't go, 'Oh, there he is,' '' Safin said with a smile during an interview in midtown on Friday. ''There is no screaming. In America, you like more show. You like big things here. Andre Agassi, you see him on TV. He's hot. Russia, it is colder reaction. Americans like hot things.</p>
        <p>''We don't have 100 programs in Russia. It's only in the United States you have 100 channels. Of course, in the hotel, there are 20 channels, but also pay TV. Here, it's TV, TV, TV.''</p>
        <p>Here, ratings are used to measure a sport's worth. For years, Agassi and Pete Sampras have been the pontoons for the popularity of men's tennis. Today, the United States Open begins with the tantalizing possibility of a Sampras-Agassi semifinal next week, but the life span of this rivalry is nearing its end.</p>
        <p>No one seems inspired to fill the void. There have been six No. 1's in this year's ATP Champions Race, a system that was designed to create fan interest by counting results from Jan. 1 that has actually left fans more confused than ever. Still, the system aside, no player has performed consistently enough to be a favorite to reach the Open final, much less capture the public's imagination.</p>
        <p>If the Tiger Woods phenomenon has reinforced anything, it is that people are mesmerized by domination. As if to manufacture a star on the tour, and do it before an American audience over the next two weeks, the ATP has begun a campaign, ''New Balls Please,'' to promote the next generation. Yesterday, Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero, Ecuador's Nicolas Lapentti, Germany's Tommy Haas and Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten were escorted into an interview room and lined up as tightly as piano keys for pictures and questions.</p>
        <p>''Pete and Andre are the guys that make things happen,'' Haas said. ''We are, like they say, the next generation. We're young guys. We still have a lot to learn. With time, hopefully we're going to be the next people to talk about.''</p>
        <p>The colorful Kuerten, with his bandanna, blond curls and barbed-wire physique, is the one voted most likely to succeed. But if Kuerten, a two-time French Open winner, is to advance his popularity in America, he will have to perform on a hard court and get through a tricky draw. In his quarter, Patrick Rafter, a two-time winner at this event, and Mark Philippoussis are looming.</p>
        <p>''Kuerten has personality, and he's well-liked,'' the television analyst John McEnroe said. ''He's got a lot of drive you don't see. The other guys are unpredictable. Pete and Andre are still going to be there for a couple of years, but there are not a lot of other guys right now.''</p>
        <p>Safin is one of the unknown variables. After a forgettable 5-11 start to the season, and through 48 rackets broken during fits of frustration, the 6-foot-4-inch Safin has won 40 of his last 50 matches. To usher him toward a coming-out party at the Open, he has a favorable path in his quarter of the draw, with third-seeded Magnus Norman posing the major threat. Safin, of course, does not want to discuss his fortuitous draw.</p>
        <p>''You know how many guys think this is their moment?'' he said. ''All 128 want to win and become a star.''</p>
        <p>Although he is resistant to the characterization, Safin has star qualities. He has a sense of humor that squeezes through the cracks in his unpolished English and a powerful game that, at times, falls short on control. He is talented and tanned, but sometimes appears to be teetering on a Philippoussis-like line. For several years, the Australian's performance was diluted by his fast-paced bachelor's life. Safin believes his night life is within the norm.</p>
        <p>''Usually, at night, I like to have a drink or have a beer,'' Safin said. ''But right now, when I'm at tournaments, I have to stay in my room, and try to do things in the right way. And I have to be nice to myself. Get rest.''</p>
        <p>On most days, he likes to sleep until noon. On Friday, a prank call awoke Safin at 9 a.m., and it was hard to recover. But even in a weary state, Safin was eager to discuss any subject, from politics to poverty. And when asked about his budding popularity, he did not seem moved by the hype. If anything, he knows humility. Safin grew up in Moscow during political upheaval, when tennis balls were considered a luxury item.</p>
        <p>''It was a difficult time,'' he said. ''There was nothing in the shops. It was difficult to find even good cheese, and to get sugar was a big problem. If you don't have shops that have food, how are you going to have tennis balls and rackets?''</p>
        <p>How could he develop at all? When Safin was 14, his parents made the difficult decision to pack their son's belongings and send him to Spain. Although he lived with a sponsor and trained with a coach, Safin was lonely and too poor to join his friends at restaurants. ''Of course, at the beginning, you say, 'Where's my family; where's my mother; where's my father and my sister?' '' Safin said. ''But after a few weeks, you start to become a normal person. You realize this is it.''</p>
        <p>This is how the career started for Safin. This was the beginning for one member of tennis's Generation Next. Just how familiar the public becomes with his story will unfold this week. If Grand Slam fame strikes, Safin will not give stardom a second thought.</p>
        <p>''Why should you have to prepare for it?'' he said. ''You move to another level, raise your ranking, but you are still living in the same world. You walk on the street with everyone, with the people. Maybe there is a lot of media, a lot of attention, but so what? Nothing should change.''</p>
