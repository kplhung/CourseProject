        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Bob Herbert did not have to travel to Los Angeles to find a working poor family in the grip of stifling poverty (column, Aug. 21). Walk into any homeless shelter here in New York City, and you'll find men and women working at low-wage jobs, unable to afford rents in this booming economy.  Walk into a city hospital's emergency room, and you'll see working families without health insurance relying on the hospital for their primary care.</p>

        <p>A minimum-wage increase is only one part of the equation. We also need welfare reform that doesn't rely on make-work programs but instead offers people an opportunity for real skill-building and jobs that provide a ladder up. Universal health care is essential, as is a commitment to the construction of affordable housing.</p>
