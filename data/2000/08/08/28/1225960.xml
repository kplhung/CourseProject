        <p>Sprint's wireless division and the Internet incubator Ecompanies plan to announce a new venture today to finance start-up companies in wireless communications.</p>
        <p>The venture, Ecompanies Wireless, will receive a $15 million investment from Spint's wireless unit, Sprint PCS, said Bill Blessing, vice president for strategic planning at the division.</p>
        <p>Like many wireless companies these days, Sprint PCS is eager to capitalize on what industry executives hope will be exploding demand for new types of data services and Internet access over cellular phones and other wireless devices.</p>
        <p>Sprint PCS has announced several other forays in this area. Last week it introduced its Wireless Web for Business, which will offer wireless access to things like company e-mail and corporate directories via Sprint PCS telephones. It also announced an alliance with Wireless Knowledge, a company backed by Microsoft and Qualcomm, which hopes to help business users receive company services.</p>
        <p>''Sprint is betting that they are moving so quickly they will be the first to capitalize on any new technology,'' said Ira Brodsky, president of Datacomm Research in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Ecompanies, for its part, gets access to Sprint's expertise, as well as its cash. Already five Ecompanies executives are working on this project, said Sangam Pant, executive vice president at Ecompanies. And a handful of Sprint PCS executives based in both Santa Monica, Calif., home of Ecompanies, and Kansas City, Mo., where Sprint has its headquarters, will be on hand to advise entrepreneurs. The new venture will be based in Santa Monica.</p>
        <p>The challenge will be to guess what services consumers really want. Recently the stock prices of wireless concerns have languished, in part because investors do not believe they have yet delivered on the rosy growth predictions for wireless services.</p>
        <p>''Companies are in a funk,'' said Tim O'Neill, a senior wireless services analyst at the investment bank Wit Soundview. ''Now you have moved from disappointment to confusion.''</p>
