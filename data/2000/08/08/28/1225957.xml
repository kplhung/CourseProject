        <p>More than 750 local governments now use the Web site operated by NetClerk to put the construction-permit process online. But so far, only the mayor of San Francisco, Willie L. Brown, has become part of NetClerk's advertising campaign.</p>
        <p>Last week, NetClerk put a picture of Mr. Brown and the city's seal on www.netclerk.com, the company's Web site, along with a letter the mayor had written praising the company for, among other things, helping reduce lines at city hall.</p>

        <p>More than 750 local governments now use the Web site operated by NetClerk to put the construction-permit process online. But so far, only the mayor of San Francisco, Willie L. Brown, has become part of NetClerk's advertising campaign.</p>
        <p>Last week, NetClerk put a picture of Mr. Brown and the city's seal on www.netclerk.com, the company's Web site, along with a letter the mayor had written praising the company for, among other things, helping reduce lines at city hall.</p>
        <p>So far, NetClerk's PermitCentral service has been used to issue more than 1,000 building permits in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>''Although we enjoy interacting with each and every person who comes to city hall, waiting in line may not be the best use of a contractor's time,'' the mayor wrote.</p>
        <p>The letter may have been less than a spontaneous testimonial. Jon Fisher, founder of NetClerk, said the company began discussing a ''public relations partnership'' with the San Francisco's mayor's office about a month ago.</p>
        <p>So how does a letterhead partnership play out?</p>
        <p>''The city of San Francisco is well known for its forward thinking, technological savvy,'' the mayor wrote. ''NetClerk offers a perfect example of how technology can improve a current system to the satisfaction of all parties involved.''</p>
        <p>For Mayor Brown, of course, the satisfaction comes from bolstering  his image as a technology supporter and promoter of the Bay Area's high-technology economy.</p>
        <p>As it happens, NetClerk, based in South San Francisco, is part of that economy.</p>
