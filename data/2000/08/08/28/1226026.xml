        <p>An angry Fernando Vargas dispensed with his challenger Ross Thompson on Saturday night. An ambitious Vargas then turned his attention to another night -- in December, when he hopes to dethrone the highly regarded Felix Trinidad.</p>
        <p>The 22-year-old Vargas, the undefeated International Boxing Federation junior middleweight champion, was angered by the way Thompson had behaved at a news conference on Thursday. Thompson punched Vargas and his promoter, Gary Shaw, who had gotten in the way, and called Vargas ''a bogus champion.''</p>
        <p>The display certainly generated more interest in the fight -- and, not surprisingly, more interest from Vargas. Before that, the bout was seen by many as nothing more than a tuneup for the Trinidad duel.</p>
        <p>During the news conference, Vargas responded with a left hook that knocked Thompson off the dais. During the fight, before 5,327 fans at the Mandalay Bay Events Center, the 153-pound Vargas came back with a lot more. He sent Thompson to the canvas twice in the third round and once in the fourth before Referee Joe Cortez stopped it at 1 minute 7 seconds of that round. The 27-year-old Thompson, a heavy underdog from Buffalo, could provide no defense.</p>
        <p>''Ross Thompson had never been knocked out, never been down,'' said Vargas, of Oxnard, Calif., who earned $1 million and improved his record to 20-0 with 18 knockouts. ''I had to show him what type of fighter I was.''</p>
        <p>He will try to prove that same point to Trinidad, who is the World Boxing Association super welterweight champion and is considered one of the world's best fighters. Trinidad, who is also undefeated, has victories against Oscar De La Hoya and David Reid on his resume.</p>
        <p>Nothing has been finalized, but it seems quite likely that the bout will be Dec. 2 in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>''It's in the hands of the attorneys,'' Shaw, Vargas's promoter, said. ''They're crossing the t's and dotting the i's.''</p>
        <p>Vargas predicted it would be a special evening.</p>
        <p>''I'm moving on to bigger and better things,'' he said. ''I'm going to be Felix Trinidad's worst enemy. I guarantee that it will be the biggest non-heavyweight fight in ratings. I guarantee that it will surpass De La Hoya's ratings. Mark my words.''</p>
        <p>Shaw added: ''He's not only going to win that fight. He is knocking Felix Trinidad out. He knows how to finish a fight.''</p>
        <p>After Vargas had finished off Thompson, who is 24-4-1 and earned $300,000, the two held another news conference. This one featured praises instead of punches.</p>
        <p>''You are a true champion,'' said Thompson, who was fined $10,000 by the Nevada Athletic Commission for his behavior at the earlier news conference. ''You are going to go on to be one of the top fighters in the world.''</p>
