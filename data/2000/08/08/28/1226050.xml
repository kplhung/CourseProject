        <p>Penn State's first play today short-circuited with a false start and a 5-yard penalty. Moments later, split end Eddie Drummond sustained a knee injury that put him out of the game. Before long, the Nittany Lions' first possession imploded with a blocked punt that created a Southern California touchdown.</p>
        <p>Three tedious hours later, Penn State's first game of the season ended in a sloppy 29-5 victory for the Trojans in the Kickoff Classic in Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>These two teams first met in the Rose Bowl of 1923. If they are to meet there again this winter as winners of their conferences, both will need to improve upon today's ragged display of nerves and errors.</p>
        <p>As the season opener for both sides, it was almost an exhibition game in terms of impact. The leaves on most trees have not changed color yet; conference games are still weeks away for U.S.C. and Penn State.</p>
        <p>''We have a chance to be a good team and maybe this will accelerate it,'' said U.S.C. Coach Paul Hackett, whose team finished 6-6 in 1999. ''Defensively, wow! They could not run the football against us. There was some question about U.S.C. football. We took a step nationally. We were carrying the banner for the Pac 10.''</p>
        <p>Penn State, a member of the Big Ten, gained only 6 net yards rushing, the lowest total in Joe Paterno's 35 years as head coach. The Nittany Lions had 142 yards of total offense.</p>
        <p>Despite the margin of victory, the Trojans' offense had little to show for its ball control (U.S.C. ran 50 times) --  probably because quarterback Carson Palmer was rusty in his return from a broken collarbone.</p>
        <p>In addition to scoring on the blocked punt, U.S.C. scored another first-half touchdown on a 43-yard interception return by Troy Polamalu, who picked off a pass from Rashard Casey, Penn State's troubled quarterback.</p>
        <p>The Trojans also made a few mistakes.</p>
        <p>They gave up a safety on a blocked punt and missed an extra point. Their best attacker was Sultan McCullough, who ran 28 times for 128 yards. Much of that yardage was gained on runs up the middle.</p>
        <p>Voted the most valuable player of the game, McCullough said he was ready to assume the starring role in the U.S.C. tailback tradition.</p>
        <p>''People say I'm a track star, but my first love is football,'' McCullough said. ''I can do it all.''</p>
        <p>He said he had run the 40-yard dash in 4.2 seconds and could probably run it in 4.1. He said his coaches told him: '' 'It's your turn to shine,' so that's what I did. It's my first game. It's my big opener. It feels good.''</p>
        <p>Not so good was Casey, who returned to his home state and some troubling memories.</p>
        <p>He was charged with assaulting an off-duty police officer in nearby Hoboken, his hometown, last May. The case is still pending, as is a civil suit.</p>
        <p>Casey ''lacked some consistency,'' according to Paterno, in completing 7 of 24 passes for 106 yards.</p>
        <p>''He's capable of playing better than that, let's put it that way,'' Paterno said. ''It was a tough outing for him, for a lot of reasons. This was a tough preseason for him, for a lot of reasons. He's got this one out of his craw. He can concentrate on having a little more fun. It's not easy for him to come back here.''</p>
        <p>Casey, replaced early in the fourth quarter by Matt Senneca, said: ''I'm glad to have this one out of the way, but I'm not glad the way it turned out. You take the good with the bad. Today, I think I might have put too much pressure on myself.''</p>
        <p>One of his linemen, tackle Kareem McKenzie, said Penn State's five penalties for false starts resulted from ''not being focused on the plays called and the snap count itself; not being as focused as we should have been.''</p>
        <p>''They had our number all day long,'' McKenzie said.</p>
        <p>The defeat kept Paterno six victories short of Bear Bryant's Division I-A record of 323. Including the end of last season, Penn State has lost four consecutive regular-season games (although the Lions won the Alamo Bowl last December).</p>
        <p>It was the fourth consecutive victory for U.S.C., which won its final three games in 1999 after losing six of the previous seven after a season-ending injury to Palmer. A sophomore, Palmer completed 10 of 20 passes for 87 yards today against Penn State.</p>
        <p>Petros Papadakis scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and David Newbury kicked field goals of 47, 27 and 44 yards for Southern Cal.</p>
        <p>Penn State's best chance to rally came in the third quarter, when the Lions blocked a punt into the U.S.C. end zone. Had Penn State fallen on the ball for a touchdown, as the Trojans had earlier, the score and an extra point could have cut the lead to 23-10 and changed the momentum. But U.S.C's Marcell Allmond recovered, the Lions got only 2 points and the crowd of 78,902 soon began to leave.</p>
