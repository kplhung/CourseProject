        <p>Dick Cheney acknowledged yesterday that the military cutbacks he and Gov. George W.

        <p>Dick Cheney acknowledged yesterday that the military cutbacks he and Gov. George W. Bush have campaigned against began when he was defense secretary for Mr. Bush's father, but he blamed the Clinton administration for making ''far deeper'' cuts that he said had left the military ''in decline.''</p>
        <p>''With respect to this question of when the cuts started, we obviously began reductions as the cold war ended in 1990 and '91, in the aftermath of Desert Storm,'' Mr. Cheney said yesterday on the ABC program  ''This Week,'' one of three Sunday morning talk programs he appeared on to discuss military preparedness.</p>
        <p>''But we started with a reduction of 25 percent in force structure,'' Mr. Cheney continued. ''They've gone far beyond that. The number of divisions in the U.S. Army has gone from 18 to 10. The number of wings in the Air Force has gone from 24 to 13. The number of ships in the Navy has gone from almost 600, now headed to less than 300. So they've cut far deeper, Sam, than anything anticipated during my watch in the Pentagon.''</p>
        <p>The Republicans have seized on the issue of military strength since Mr. Bush told the Republican National Convention earlier this month that the military is ''low on pay, parts and morale.'' Mr. Bush said that two divisions of the Army were not ready for duty -- a claim rebutted by the Pentagon, which said that two units had been unprepared last fall, when soldiers were deployed in Bosnia and Kosovo, but were now ''combat ready.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Cheney echoed many of Mr. Bush's assertions, saying that the armed forces suffered from low morale, unreadiness and difficulty recruiting and retaining personnel.</p>
        <p>''I think if you match our forces today up against any others around the world, we've got the best force,'' Mr. Cheney said on the NBC program ''Meet the Press.'' ''The problem is it's in decline, and this administration has done very little to reverse that decline.''</p>
        <p>He strongly criticized Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, for disputing the Bush campaign's assessment, saying, ''The only conclusion I can draw from Al Gore's comments about all this is that either he doesn't know what's going on in the U.S. military or he chooses not to tell the truth about it.''</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign took exception. ''I think Bush and Cheney have lost all credibility on the defense issue,'' said Doug Hattaway, a campaign spokesman. ''America has the strongest, most capable fighting force in the whole world. Mr. Cheney has already admitted that the military downsizing began under the Bush-Quayle-Cheney administration. The Clinton-Gore administration stopped this free fall and enacted the largest military investment since Reagan.''</p>
        <p>Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney, said that no one had more credibility on military issues than Mr. Cheney, who, as secretary of defense under President Bush, oversaw the Persian Gulf war of 1991. ''Vice President Gore is trying to sweep the military preparedness issue under the rug so he can be held blameless,'' she said.</p>
        <p>On all three morning programs, Mr. Cheney was asked about an issue that has dogged him in recent weeks: the fact that upon his retirement this month as head of Halliburton, an oil services company, he was given millions of dollars' worth of stock options that he cannot exercise for more than a year -- giving him a potential conflict of interest if he is elected vice president, since he will have a vested interest in the price of Halliburton stock.</p>
        <p>He repeated his assertions that he would do whatever was necessary to avoid any conflict of interest, saying that he had ''smart people'' working on the problem and that his options ranged from giving any increase in the value of the stock to charity to maneuvering so the price of the stock could be fixed before he entered office.</p>
        <p>Asked on the CBS program ''Face the Nation'' if he would consider giving up the stock options that have not vested, Mr. Cheney said: ''Well, I'd like not to have to give away all my assets in order to serve the public. I don't think that's required; it shouldn't be.''</p>
