        <p>Confident as an old-time Chicago ward boss, Walid Khatter, Interior Minister Michel Murr's man in this Greek Orthodox village, stood in the doorway of his polling station at midafternoon and predicted the results.</p>
        <p>''We have around 1,000 voters in this district. There will be about 800 for the Michel Murr ticket,'' he said, adding dismissively, ''about 200 for the others.''</p>
        <p>How, a visitor asked, could he be so sure?</p>
        <p>''Oh, we know,'' he said with a shrug and a grin, opening a hand bedecked with three huge gold rings to show a stack of palm cards listing Mr. Murr's slate of candidates.</p>
        <p>An aide materialized from the crush of more than a dozen Murr campaign workers -- the whole area was festooned with portraits of Mr. Murr -- with numbers scratched on a sheet of paper and nodded assent.</p>
        <p>Surrounded by reminders of their tribal politics, Lebanese went to the polls today in the beginning of a two-stage parliamentary election overshadowed by Syrian dominance and a bitter struggle between the current government and its critics. Results from today's voting are expected to be announced on Monday.</p>
        <p>Here in the Christian heartland of Mount Lebanon, among the suburban sprawl running up the mountains from Beirut, the focus was on the battle between a slate headed by the powerful Mr. Murr -- one of Syria's biggest supporters -- and an opposition slate headed by Nassib Lahoud, a wealthy businessman and former ambassador to the United States. Mr. Lahoud is a cousin of the president but is nonetheless a critic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murr has come under fierce criticism from the opposition because of his multiple roles as a candidate running for re-election to Parliament, a staunch supporter of the government, and ultimately the man in charge of running the elections. With his government post, he controls the police and internal security forces, the granting or withholding of various licenses and patronage over a huge number of public employees.</p>
        <p>His power was evident today. Entrances to many of the polling places were surrounded by election workers in baby blue T-shirts and baseball hats. The Arabic legend on the T-shirts read simply: ''Michel Murr.''</p>
        <p>Every seat in Parliament is assigned to one of the country's 17 officially recognized religions, minutely derived from a census taken in 1932. (There has never been one since for fear of political upset.) In the voting today, citizens went into separate rooms in the polling places, divided both by men and women and by each religious sect in a district: Maronite Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Sunni Muslim and so on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khattar's district here is so homogeneous that there are only two sets of voting rooms: Greek Orthodox and, he said, ''assorted.''</p>
        <p>Rafik Hariri, the multibillionaire builder who is running for Parliament, is trying to make a comeback as prime minister. He is locked in a bitter struggle with President Emile Lahoud, who has unleashed much of the government's power against him, including hours of ill-supported accusations and ridicule on state television.</p>
        <p>The conflict has become so intense in recent days that the new Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, has summoned Lebanese political leaders to Damascus, and Syria's long effective regent in Lebanon, Maj. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan, has been meeting with them here in an effort to restore calm.</p>
        <p>In today's voting, 63 of the Parliament's 128 seats were at stake in three districts: Northern Lebanon, largely Christian, but with a big Sunni Muslim population in Tripoli; the Metn Mountains north and east of Beirut that are the Christian heartland; and the Shuf, traditional home of the Druse. Beirut, and the largely Shiite areas of the Bekaa and southern Lebanon vote next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Under the Taif agreement of 1989, which helped end the bloody 15-year civil war in which some 150,000 people died and much of the country was destroyed, the president is to name the prime minister supported by blocks that make up a simple majority in Parliament after ''binding negotiations.''</p>
        <p>While much of the voting seemed to go smoothly, there were troubles through the day in Burj al Hammud, an Armenian ghetto near the port long dominated by its ethnic Tashnak Party, which is supporting Mr. Murr. In a rare move, Mr. Lahoud's opposition slate put up a candidate for an Armenian seat in the Metn district usually held by Tashnak.</p>
        <p>The opposition candidate, Raffi Madoyan, an Armenian who is not a Tashnak, was attacked and beaten twice during the day by Tashnak supporters and local television cameramen filmed men smashing windows in his fleeing car with clubs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lahoud's political adviser, Joe Bahout, said the opposition had hoped to pick up between 8,000 and 10,000 votes in Burj al Hammoud and was worried that Tashnak supporters were ''trying to create a panic by physical violence.''</p>
        <p>Early in the morning in Burj al Hammoud, an opposition poll watcher, Wassim Lahoud, stood in frustration outside a polling place at the Mar Youssef church, complaining that his crew had not been given their proper credentials to go inside, and that Mr. Murr's supporters had illegally set up a computer to track voters inside another polling station. Indeed the computer operation so enraged the opposition that one of its candidates -- Michel Samaha, a former information minister -- stormed into the municipal building and turned the table over.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murr turned up at that polling station toward midday in a caravan of police vehicles and was greeted warmly by the election workers inside with hugs, handshakes and a round of applause.</p>
        <p>''Look around,'' he replied in French when asked about charges of vote rigging. ''Do you see anyone who is pressuring? Where?''</p>
        <p>By late afternoon, scores of blue-shirted Murr campaign workers had set up their computer operation again on tables under a white sun umbrella inside the police lines and were busily checking the voters in.</p>
