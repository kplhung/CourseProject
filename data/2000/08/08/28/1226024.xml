        <p>From ''the luck of the draw'' to ''dangerous floaters'' tennis players tread lightly about their destiny during a Grand Slam tournament. If you can finesse your way through seven singles matches over two weeks, you are, indeed, a survivor.</p>
        <p>The language of the Australian, French, Wimbledon and the United States Open carries an unmistakable mystique for players and fans. At the Open, which begins today at the National Tennis Center, solving certain puzzles can be as demanding for most players as topspin lobs or angled crosscourts:</p>
        <p>Here are some of the more intriguing language zones:</p>
        <p>LUCK OF THE DRAW -- Staring at a tough first-round match can destroy a player's psyche in a Grand Slam event even before a ball is hit. Building momentum through each round, with opponents that can test you but not beat you or grind you down, is the luck of champions. A look inside this year's draw says Martina Hingis will have a strenuous path to a title, with Monica Seles, Venus Williams and Lindsay Davenport or Serena Williams from the quarters on. For someone whose game is fashioned more on mental toughness than on power, Hingis's draw is not lucky.</p>
        <p>Among the men, Andre Agassi could have Thomas Enqvist, Pete Sampras and Yevgeny Kafelnikov before hitting the final.</p>
        <p>Best draw: Venus Williams, who should have comfortable early matches, Hingis in the quarters and perhaps her sister Serena, but not until the final.</p>
        <p>OPENING BLASTS -- Every Grand Slam tournament has first-round matches that promise to be lively, unpredictable and possibly (for the men) five-set epics. The best of this year's openers are Goran Ivanisevic (who else?) against Dominik Hrbaty, Todd Martin-Vincent Spadea and Magnus Norman-Paul Goldstein. The only first-rounder among the women that promises big hits and perhaps some drama is fourth-seeded Mary Pierce against 19-year-old Alexandra Stevenson.</p>
        <p>DANGEROUS FLOATERS -- These are good unseeded players who can spoil the party for favorites. This year, the floaters to fear are Patrick Rafter, a former Open champion, the enigmatic Karol Kucera and the hard-serving Richard Krajicek among the men, Chanda Rubin and Jelena Dokic in the women's draw.</p>
        <p>AFTER DARK -- The Open was the first Slam to initiate night play 25 years ago (Australia also has night matches now). The initial response of the players was frustration: Europeans fretted about diminished vision and the perception that balls travel faster at night, especially on hard courts. They also felt that seeded stars got to pick their nights against opponents they thought would be less effective under the stars, a charge continually denied by officials.</p>
        <p>But numbers don't lie. Pete Sampras has a 13-0 won-lost record in night matches. Martina Navratilova (16-0) and Chris Evert (14-0) also went unbeaten at night. Jimmy Connors, with fists pumping, produced a 24-2 career record after dark.</p>
        <p>TIE BREAKERS -- The Open was ahead of the game on what the tours call ''tiebreaks,'' to the dismay of purists. Under the stewardship of the late Bill Talbert, 9-point sudden-death tie breakers (the brainchild of a Rhode Island rogue, Jimmy Van Alen) were instituted at the Open in 1970.</p>
        <p>While 12-point tiebreaks are the norm on today's circuits, the Open remains the only Grand Slam event that uses a playoff to decide a final set.</p>
        <p>Over 30 years, 94 fifth-set tiebreaks have been played in men's singles, including five last year, four in the first round. In women's singles, 84 three-setters have gone to a decisive tiebreak at 6-all, including two finals that Martina Navratilova lost, in 1981 to Tracy Austin and 1985 to Hana Mandlikova. Navratilova also won a third-set tiebreak over Steffi Graf in a 1986 semifinal en route to the title.</p>
        <p>WILD CARDS -- Every tournament has wild cards, but wild-card invitations at a Grand Slam event (16 at the Open) are considered special. This year, for example, wild cards went to Andy Roddick, the world's No. 1 junior, and Alex Kim, the national collegiate champion, who faces Andre Agassi tonight. Among the women, the lone New York resident in the singles draw, Dawn Buth, 22, of Riverdale, received a wild card and drew another American, Ansley Cargill. Some wild-card entries are disliked by other players who feel these pros have gotten a ''free pass'' into the tournament without going through ''qualies'' or through internal politics. Hence, opponents will try harder against a wild-card opponent as a reminder to tournament officials.</p>
        <p>LUCKY LOSERS -- Players who lose in the last round of qualifying can gain a spot in the 128-player main draws through injury withdrawals (they are selected by rank order). Their stays are usually short: only one male lucky loser (Laurence Tieleman in 1999) has managed to reach the third round of singles. Maria Jose Gaidano (1993) is the only woman to have advanced as far as the fourth round.</p>
        <p>SUPER SATURDAY -- Fans love it, television promotes it, players loathe it. The packaging of one men's semifinal, the women's singles final and a second men's semifinal on the last Saturday means no rest day for the men before Sunday's final. Foreign players unhappily expect to play the early semi if seeded Americans like Sampras and Agassi are still around because television wants the bigger names for ratings.</p>
        <p>Is the scheduling fair? No. But the Open dares to be different, for better or worse.</p>
