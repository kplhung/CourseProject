        <p>OM Gruppen, which runs the Stockholm stock exchange, is expected to make a formal offer, which could include a hostile bid, for the London Stock Exchange, which rejected an informal $:800 million ($1.18 billion) proposal last week, executives close to the discussions said today.</p>
        <p>The bid would come just weeks before a shareholder vote on the proposed merger between the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges, which, along with an alliance with the Nasdaq stock market, would create a pan-European powerhouse with a 24-hour global market. The Swedish overture also revived interest from Euronext -- a combination of the Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris exchanges -- which had approached the London exchange about a link-up last spring but was rebuffed. The details of its proposal were never made public to shareholders.</p>
        <p>Last week, OM Guppen offered $:7 ($10.30) in cash and $:20 ($29.50) worth of new OM stock for the London exchange, which amounted to 15 percent more than the closing price of $:23.50 for the exchange's shares on Friday. A formal is expected to be roughly the same amount but would ''include more specific numbers,'' said the executives close to the talks.</p>
        <p>With a market value of $:2.6 billion, OM shares are trading at a richly valued 80 times trailing earnings, which leads some analysts to worry that the offer consists mainly of ''inflated paper.''</p>
        <p>''The OM proposal was rejected out of hand because it didn't make any sense commercially or financially,'' an executive close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>The jostling for the London exchange underscores the problems that old-school European exchanges are facing as they merge to offer single-currency trading and to better compete with fast-growing electronic exchanges. Even before the Swedish bid, it was unclear whether the London and German partnership would win the 75 percent shareholder approval needed to push the deal through as regulatory and operational questions have mounted. Shareholders are expected to vote on the deal on Sept. 14.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the London exchange said there were no plans to delay the vote in light of the Swedish bid.</p>
        <p>The London Stock Exchange is governed by the British takeover panel, which could postpone the vote to allow shareholders more time to assess the new information. Some shareholders have already called for a delay.</p>
        <p>The decision to merge ''should be delayed so that all the shareholders of the L.S.E. have information on the various options,'' said Angela Knight, chief executive of Britain's Association of Private Client Investment Managers  and Stockbrokers.</p>
        <p>In its overtures to Frankfurt, the London stock exchange is hoping to gain scale and influence, and it thinks the Stockholm exchange would bring it less of both.</p>
        <p>''We are looking to provide a strong European presence with access to liquidity in a wide range of equities, which merging with Germany would do,'' said the spokesman for the London exchange. ''Stockholm doesn't provide us with European consolidation.''</p>
        <p>The merger of the London and Frankfurt exchanges into iX, for International Exchange,  would control 53 percent of European equity trading with a combined value of $4.29 trillion. That would make iX the largest European exchange, ahead of Euronext, based in Paris,  which will trade stocks valued at $2.2 trillion.</p>
        <p>Although the Stockholm exchange has been aggressive and growing quickly -- it is about to introduce an online system called Jiway in a deal with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter -- it still controls only 5 percent of the European equity market. And its derivatives operation, through the London-based OMLX, pales in comparison to the Frankfurt exchange's Eurex, which is the world's largest market for trading derivatives, the complex financial contracts whose values are based on underlying assets like stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies.</p>
        <p>Even before the Swedish interest, the iX merger was by no means guaranteed. Stockbrokers and shareholders have questioned the proposed operations of the new exchange, a concern echoed by the Financial Services Authority of Britain and the Federal Securities Trading Security Authority of Germany. Under the current terms of the merger, high growth stocks would be traded under the rules laid out by Frankfurt, where the Neue Market has different listing requirements than does Britain's Alternative Investment Market. Blue-chip stocks will follow British guidelines, which require immediate reporting of most large trades to the exchange, a guideline not required in Germany. Other issues include the cost of new technology. The merged entity would use Germany's Xetra trading system. The London exchange has said it will contribute $:8 million to help its members cover the conversion costs, but it remains unclear whether that amount will be sufficient, or whether any savings can be derived from the new system.</p>
