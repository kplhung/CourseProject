        <p>''Friendly fire'' may have been responsible for killing three Israeli soldiers in a bungled West Bank antiterror operation on Saturday, Israeli officials acknowledged today. But they defended the late-night attack on the hideout of a man accused of terrorism who heads Israel's most-wanted list.</p>
        <p>The wanted man, Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, fled during the assault to the nearby Palestinian-governed city of Nablus, where he surrendered to local security officials and remained in their custody today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanoud, a leader of the underground military wing of Hamas, is held responsible by Israel for the deaths of 21 civilians in the terrorist bombings of an outdoor food market and pedestrian mall in downtown Jerusalem in 1997.</p>
        <p>He is also accused of plotting further attacks in a calculated attempt to disrupt peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, which are entering a critical and perhaps definitive phase in the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>''This man, Abu Hanoud, whose capture and interception was the objective of this operation, is responsible for the deaths of dozens of people in the past,'' Prime Minister Ehud Barak said today. Had Mr. Hanoud remained at large, the prime minister said, it ''would have placed the lives of dozens of Israeli citizens in jeopardy in the future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak said that Israel may request Mr. Hanoud's extradition. But Palestinian officials, irked at Israel's failure to inform them of the raid, insisted that Mr. Hanoud would be tried in Palestinian courts and if convicted would be sent to a Palestinian jail.</p>
        <p>''The Israelis made a mistake and paid the price,'' said Jibril Rajoub, the director of Palestinian security in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>The raid involved hundreds of troops and was led by an undercover Israeli brigade that specializes in plainclothes work in Arab communities. It took place in a northern West Bank village near Nablus, called Asira al Shamaliya, where Palestinians run their own municipal affairs but Israel retains ultimate security control.</p>
        <p>If the Israeli officials had told their Palestinian counterparts that they had identified Mr. Hanoud's whereabouts, the two security forces could have worked together to secure his arrest ''without bloodshed,'' Mr. Rajoub asserted. A senior Palestinian security official said tonight that Israel and the Palestinian Authority have not yet had any high-level communications about the episode.</p>
        <p>Israeli Army officers confirmed today that one soldier was wounded in the raid by Israeli Army fire and said they could not rule out the possibility that all three solders who died were also victims of Israeli bullets. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli Army chief of staff, said he had ordered an internal army inquiry into the episode, which he tentatively attributed to planning errors and the misidentification of undercover forces.</p>
        <p>''It is possible that some of the dead and the injured soldiers were hit by friendly fire -- a grave and painful operational mishap second to none,'' Mr. Barak said.</p>
        <p>The three deaths constituted the worst loss of life by Israeli security forces in the West Bank since 1996, when nine soldiers died in clashes with Palestinian rioters.</p>
        <p>Still, both General Mofaz and Mr. Barak vigorously defended the raid, stressing that Mr. Hanoud has been apprehended, along with other accused members of the clandestine Hamas military wing.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the awkward truth was that while the death of the Israeli soldiers was a grievous embarrassment for the military -- as well as a tragedy for the soldiers' friends and families -- it was not the diplomatic disaster that was initially feared.</p>
        <p>If the soldiers had been killed by Palestinian gunmen, as was first reported late Saturday night, the concern here was that it could have put an abrupt halt to the peace negotiations, reviving Israeli distrust of Palestinian negotiating partners. It would also have brought the already weakened Barak government under further attack for an apparent inability to rout out terror cells in collaboration with the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Instead, Israeli officials took pains today to praise the security cooperation of the Palestinian Authority, which they consider crucial to the near cessation of terrorist attacks against Israelis over the past year and a half. They also expressed confidence that the authority would prosecute Mr. Hanoud, who poses as much of a political threat to Yasir Arafat as he does to Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>''I have no doubt that the fact that he was hit and later captured by the Palestinians will disrupt Hamas activity and limit their ability to carry out terror attacks in the near future,'' General Mofaz said.</p>
