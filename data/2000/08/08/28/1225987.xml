        <p>To listen to the editors and publishers of the Web site Inside.com and the magazine Industry Standard talk about the new technology and entertainment magazine they announced last week is to imagine the excitement of ancient Mesopotamians discussing their newly invented wheel.</p>
        <p>For the participants it all seems so revolutionary.</p>
        <p>The weekly magazine will be titled Inside: The Business of Entertainment, Media and Technology. It is supposed to make its debut by the year's end, focusing on the impact of digital technology on the media and entertainment industries. The magazine will be published in a partnership between Standard Media International, the parent company of the two-year-old Internet business magazine The Industry Standard, and Powerful Media, the parent of Inside.com, an entertainment industry news Web site that started in June and is still trying to find its way.</p>
        <p>Michael Hirschorn, the editor in chief of Inside.com, said last week that the Internet economy and digital technology were about to undergo the long-predicted melding and transformation that would make the magazine necessary reading across several industries.</p>
        <p>''Don't think I'm a geek, but for example I consider Napster to be an epochal event,'' Mr. Hirschorn said, referring to the service that lets people swap digital music files online with little regard to copyrights. ''It is one of the things that will change the Internet profoundly, forever. You have to accept the idea that digital technology is going to transform each of the industries we cover -- film, television, music, book publishing, magazines and newspapers, and that is why this magazine is right, right now.''</p>
        <p>For all its nowness, the debut of Inside, the magazine, prompts several questions:</p>
        <p>*Why would Inside.com, which initially introduced a mediacentric Web site with high hopes for its solo success, now introduce a print magazine, which is costly to produce and distribute?</p>
        <p>*What does Standard Media International, which is a unit of the International Data Group and is already busy with the ad-rich Industry Standard and the introduction of a European edition, get from the deal?</p>
        <p>*Perhaps most significantly, is the crunched magazine field ready for a weekly title about the way that digital technology is affecting the entertainment industry?</p>
        <p>Inside.com, as a Web site, has not attracted the number of subscriptions it had hoped for.</p>
        <p>''We had anticipated 30,000 subscriptions, but we fell short of that,'' said Deanna Brown, the chief executive of Powerful Media, declining to be more specific. She said it was not the cost of subscriptions -- originally planned for $217 annually -- that was the problem but that the Web site started late in recruiting subscribers.</p>
        <p>But visitors have started to come to the free portions of the Inside.com. The 160,000 unique visitors in June compared with 80,000 that same month for a competitor, Variety.com, according to Media Metrix. Inside's new partner, The Industry Standard, which has a free circulation in print of 200,000, drew many more unique visitors to its own Web site in June: 490,000 more than Inside.com did. (Then again, last week the Inside.com site was down for two days.)</p>
        <p>If subscriptions are the goal for the executives at Inside.com, maybe a print magazine makes sense, even if it is expensive to produce. It can offer the chance to attract more people who would rather not cruise the Web, but it can also serve as an advertising billboard for those who might also be interested in the site. Also worth considering is the fact that the publishers of The Industry Standard -- whose weekly circulation is relatively minuscule compared with, say, BusinessWeek's 950,000 -- are not expecting a sudden, enormous circulation for the new publication.</p>
        <p>The Industry Standard has had a heady advertising success, with ad pages up 376 percent this year, according to Mediaweek magazine. But some advertising executives are wary of the new venture's narrow focus.</p>
        <p>''We are seeing that all aspects of the media are getting nicheier and nicheier and more narrow and more vertical,'' said David Verklin, chief executive of Carat North America, a media services company. ''It's gotten to the point where I am starting to question whether some of these magazines ought to be newsletters.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Verklin also questioned whether a Web site that had failed to meet its subscription demands could spin off a successful print magazine.</p>
        <p>''Of course, then you can turn around and look at how well The Industry Standard is doing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Industry Standard, for its part, will get equity in the new venture in exchange for the use of its back-office operations to produce and distribute the magazine -- although the Inside.com side of the partnership plans to supply much of the editorial content.</p>
        <p>''Clearly there is a financial component to this equation because they are providing a lot of services,'' Ms. Brown said. She would not disclose the terms.</p>
        <p>John Battelle, the chief executive of Standard Media, who was a founding editor at an earlier digital-revolution manifesto, Wired magazine, said that he did business with people, first, because he liked them and their work, and second, if he thought they would make money for his company.</p>
        <p>''And should they succeed, we want a piece of that success,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown added that the team at The Industry Standard would also gain access to an exclusive world.</p>
        <p>''They get an introduction to the inner sanctums of some of these industries,'' she said. ''You know, we did not hire a bunch of 22-year-olds out of dot-com school to run this company. We hired seasoned executives who have been around the block and who know people.'' (Last week, the magazine hired its first editor on a consulting basis: Sarah Bartlett, the former editor in chief of Oxygen Media.)</p>
        <p>Even some competing magazine editors said last week that the concept behind Inside was a solid one. Ned Desmond, the editor in chief of E-Company Now, a new monthly magazine published by Time Inc., said that the intersection of technology and entertainment was a growth area that deserved watching.</p>
        <p>''There is certainly the case that there is a lot going on, as a whole bunch of industries try to figure out digital technologies and entertainment,'' he said. ''And we are fascinated by the same subject.''</p>
        <p>E-Company Now's own rate base -- the circulation guaranteed to advertisers -- began at 200,000 earlier this year and will be 325,000 in January, Mr. Desmond said.</p>
        <p>Oh, and one final question:</p>
        <p>What of Kurt Andersen -- book author, media demicelebrity, Giorgio Armani model in the current issue of W magazine, former contributing editor at The New Yorker, the former editor in chief of New York magazine and one of Powerful Media's founders?</p>
        <p>Mr. Andersen said he would supervise and offer advice to the magazine for the next few months, but that he planned to devote most of his energies to ratcheting up Powerful Media's conference business. The first conference will take place on the West Coast in May, Mr. Andersen said.</p>
        <p>''One of the things you are obliged to do in this business is conferences,'' he said. ''There are a jillion Internet, tech-specific conferences, but relatively few coming from the side we come from, which is entertainment and content and the media. So that will be a big part of what I do here.''</p>
        <p>MEDIA  Correction:  August 29, 2000, Tuesday  An article in Business Day yesterday about Inside: The Business of Entertainment, Media and Technology, a magazine to be started by Powerful Media and Standard Media International, misstated the circulation breakdown of The Industry Standard, whose back-office operations will produce and distribute the new magazine. About 45 percent of the Industry Standard's 200,000 readers receive the magazine free. Not all of them do.</p>
