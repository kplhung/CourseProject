        <p>Though Neil LaBute's ''Bash: Latter-Day Plays'' wasn't written originally for television, it translates so well it could have been. The intimacy of this trilogy of one-act monologues, designed as sparely as a SoHo dress store, seems made for television, and not just because one of the actors is Ally McBeal (a k a Calista Flockhart). The characters spill their secrets in a confessional rush, like guests on a talk show.</p>
        <p>But the familiarity is deceptive, which simply adds another layer to Mr. LaBute's insistent investigation of the nastiness lurking beneath the most placid exteriors. As a filmmaker (''In the Company of Men'') and a playwright, he specializes in exhuming the worm within. Evil isn't always interesting, he insists. It exists in the blandest of men and women. When you've stepped into Mr. LaBute's fantasy neighborhood, you'd better watch out for the apple-cheeked boy next door. He might go berserk and kill you.</p>

        <p>Though Neil LaBute's ''Bash: Latter-Day Plays'' wasn't written originally for television, it translates so well it could have been. The intimacy of this trilogy of one-act monologues, designed as sparely as a SoHo dress store, seems made for television, and not just because one of the actors is Ally McBeal (a k a Calista Flockhart). The characters spill their secrets in a confessional rush, like guests on a talk show.</p>
        <p>But the familiarity is deceptive, which simply adds another layer to Mr. LaBute's insistent investigation of the nastiness lurking beneath the most placid exteriors. As a filmmaker (''In the Company of Men'') and a playwright, he specializes in exhuming the worm within. Evil isn't always interesting, he insists. It exists in the blandest of men and women. When you've stepped into Mr. LaBute's fantasy neighborhood, you'd better watch out for the apple-cheeked boy next door. He might go berserk and kill you.</p>
        <p>In each of these one-act confessionals Mr. LaBute has his characters inflict a gory surprise on the audience that feels like a betrayal, as it should, given his world view. People may want to be good, he implies, but they will be bad.</p>
        <p>Mr. LaBute understands that words matter, especially in a work that relies almost entirely on storytelling, not on dialogue or action. He's tuned in to the strangely poetic rhythms in everyday speech and the telling details of workaday life. When one of his characters recalls her seduction and subsequent pregnancy at 13 by her schoolteacher, she says: ''I went home with our baby inside me and watched 'Hogan's Heroes' on TV. Like I do every afternoon.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes he misses a beat and contrives poetry where prose would do. A callow character who fumbles trying to remember contemporaries of F. Scott Fitzgerald, as well as proper grammar, says of a man he's brutalized, ''We feasted on him like carrion and left nothing but bones.'' You feel like flossing after taking in a mouthful like that, from a man like that.</p>
        <p>Mr. LaBute has shrewdly directed this film version of his play (which was directed for the theater by Joe Mantello) from a live performance, using the camera mainly to emphasize the confidential feeling the stark stage setting provides. Not surprisingly the camera doesn't fail Ms. Flockhart, who appears in two of the pieces. She's a giddy young woman in ''A Gaggle of Saints,'' about two Boston College sweethearts recalling an unforgettable weekend in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Paul Rudd, as her cute boyfriend, carries the drama in this story, about a superficially good-natured frat boy whose banality is laced with a lust for violence. He's so cocky and complacent that he feels it's his birthright to attack anyone who disturbs his vision of how things should be. Though he does nothing more than narrow his eyes as he casually recalls his terrible crime, Mr. Rudd seems transformed as he reveals his character's ugly soul. Ms. Flockhart on the other hand remains innocent and chipper in her pretty evening dress: more or less a corsage, a lovely, retro adornment.</p>
        <p>But in ''Medea Redux'' her skill and bravery as an actress emerge front and center in the role of the woman who as a girl was impregnated and then abandoned by her teacher. Stringy-haired and red-eyed, appearing even frailer than usual, she seems to be clutching at language for dear life -- her character has already lost her grip on sanity -- as she tells her story to a tape recorder at a police station.</p>
        <p>The last ''bash,'' ''Iphigenia in Orem,'' is the least convincing, through no fault of Ron Eldard's; he perfectly relays the cautious banter of the bland businessman, a man who describes himself as ''slightly above'' average. Here, too, Mr. LaBute captures the incongruities in human behavior. When the businessman, whose child suffocated under a blanket, explains that he and his wife ate pizza afterward, he realizes how absurd it seems. But even when tragedy strikes, he observes, you have to eat. Mr. LaBute recognizes that the terrible and the mundane are inextricably linked.</p>
        <p>Unlike the unexpected turns in the first two acts, however, the chilling surprise here feels contrived. When the evil emerges from circumstance (in ''Medea'') or character (in ''Gaggle''), it's disturbing and calls up basic questions of morality and human resilience. Mr. LaBute is a Mormon, and these works carry crosscurrents of religious devotion and hypocrisy. But the events in the third piece seem grounded only in the sour assumption that betrayal and the raw desire for redress may be the only traits built into the human genome. A grim conclusion, but spoken well.</p>
