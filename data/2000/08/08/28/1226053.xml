        <p>The California Health Services Department named Ground Zero in Marina del Rey, Calif., to handle its tobacco education account. Billings were estimated at $125 million for the five-year contract.</p>
        <p>Colleen Stevens, chief for the media campaign at the Department of Health Services tobacco control program, said the decision came after a three-month review that was narrowed to Ground Zero and one other finalist, Dailey &amp; Associates in West Hollywood, Calif., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Other participants in the review included: DGWB in Irvine, Calif. and Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group.</p>

        <p>The incumbent was Asher/Gal &amp; Partners in Los Angeles, which resigned in June, and in the meantime, has been named to handle the first large-scale anti-tobacco campaign for the state of Washington by the Washington Department of Health in Olympia, Wash.</p>
        <p>Billings for the account, which will be handled in partnership with DeLaunay/Phillips in Seattle, were estimated at $15 million for a three-year contract. Asher/Gal changed its name from Asher &amp; Partners after merging with Italia/Gal Advertising last month.</p>
