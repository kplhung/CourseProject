        <p>The two United States teams had mixed fortunes at the start of the World Championships here today. In the first session of play the open team outscored Bangladesh 20-10, but the women's team lost 12-18 to Taiwan. In the second round the American open team lost to Hungary 8-22, while the women's team beat Russia by the same score.</p>
        <p>Seventy-two open teams are competing in four groups, with four to qualify from each for playoffs next week. The women's series has 40 teams divided into two groups, with eight to qualify from each.</p>
        <p>On the final deal of the first session, shown in the diagram, the Americans seemed likely to gain. Steve Garner and Howard Weinstein, as North and South, bid efficiently to six hearts as shown. Two diamonds was a transfer response, and the jump to three spades announced slam interest with an undisclosed singleton. Three no-trump asked North to show his singleton, and four diamonds was ''last train,'' meaning continuing slam interest but a willingness to stop. The good slam was then reached.</p>
        <p>Since a heart trick must be lost, it appears that the slam is due to fail. Weinstein was helped by a diamond lead and made his contract. In the replay the lead was a passive spade, but the Bangladesh declarer survived by good play. He won with the spade ace and took the heart finesse losing to the king.</p>
        <p>He won the next spade lead with the queen, drew the missing trumps and led to the club ace. He ruffed a club, crossed to the spade king and ruffed another club. This left East with the impossible task of guarding both minor suits. South cashed his remaining trumps, making his slam by squeezing East. There was no swing on the deal.</p>
