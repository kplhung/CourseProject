        <p>When the double fault smacked into the net to end his match this afternoon, Magnus Norman frowned, picked at his racket strings and walked slowly toward the net, his head down.</p>
        <p>Norman had not lost. He had just had a great tuneup for the United States Open, staving off two championship points and winning his second straight Hamlet Cup title, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5.

        <p>When the double fault smacked into the net to end his match this afternoon, Magnus Norman frowned, picked at his racket strings and walked slowly toward the net, his head down.</p>
        <p>Norman had not lost. He had just had a great tuneup for the United States Open, staving off two championship points and winning his second straight Hamlet Cup title, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5. But on the other side of the net stood his close friend Thomas Enqvist, whom he had beaten for the first time in five meetings and who had leg cramps during the final two games of the match.</p>
        <p>The two exchanged a few words in Swedish before walking off the court together.</p>
        <p>''I told him, 'This is not the way I wanted to beat you,' '' said Norman, who a few moments later was smiling and waving to his many fans in the sellout crowd of 5,000. ''He said, 'You deserve it.' ''</p>
        <p>As Enqvist put it: ''I was close to winning, but I was also close to losing in two straight sets. Too many unforced errors, too many double faults.''</p>
        <p>Indeed. Enqvist, 26, who will face the clay-court specialist Mariano Puerta of Argentina in the first round of the United States Open as the seventh-seeded player, had 11 double faults and 60 unforced errors in the final -- this after not dropping a set on the way to the final.</p>
        <p>Norman, 24, who made it to the fourth round of the United States Open last year before retiring with a back injury, is seeded third this year. He was quick to pounce today, breaking serve in the first game when Enqvist made three straight unforced forehand errors.</p>
        <p>The mistakes continued to pile up for Enqvist, who served up more double faults (5) than aces (4) in the first set and handed point after point to Norman with unforced errors from both his forehand and his backhand. Enqvist, seeded third here, had only one chance to break Norman in the first set, during the fourth game, but sent his backhand into the net to go back to deuce before losing the game.</p>
        <p>Norman quickly went up a break in the fourth game of the second set on Enqvist's sixth double fault of the match and was serving for the match at 5-3 when things inexplicably flip-flopped. Ahead by 30-0, Norman got a bad bounce off the tape, then mis-hit a forehand after an extended rally and hit two backhands into the net to give Enqvist his first break.</p>
        <p>Enqvist, his forehands finally finding their mark, then ripped through the next three games to take the second set, and went up by 5-2 in the third. But Norman stubbornly dug in, breaking back as Enqvist, his upper left thigh beginning to cramp, was serving for the match. Norman fought off two match points after going down by 30-40 on his serve, and then tied it at 5-5 on another Enqvist double fault. He broke Enqvist again in the 10th game, on a double fault, and then went ahead, 6-5, firing three aces along the way.</p>
        <p>After getting treatment from Alex Stober, the ATP trainer, Enqvist was still having trouble with his first serve. Fighting off one match point with a brilliant volley, Enqvist double-faulted once, then twice, to hand Norman the match.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't the cramps; it really didn't bother me,'' Enqvist said. ''I lost because I was not able to put the match together. Magnus is a very tough player.''</p>
        <p>Norman, who with the victory earned his fourth title in five finals this year, said he felt confident heading into this week's Grand Slam event.</p>
        <p>''I feel great -- I couldn't ask for a better warm-up for the Open,'' said Norman, who will face the baseliner Paul Goldstein in the first round of the Open, which begins Monday. ''I got a lot of confidence and I know I can build on that. I know I can go all the way, but I'm only looking at the first match right now.''</p>
