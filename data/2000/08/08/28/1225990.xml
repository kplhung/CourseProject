        <p>Add to the list of the wonders of DNA: the ability, in the not-so-distant future, to help African-Americans figure out where their ancestors probably came from before they were enslaved.</p>
        <p>In Boston this fall, some 300 African-American schoolchildren are to be sent home with swabs to gather DNA samples from inside the mouths of their family members, part of a nascent project that a local molecular biologist hopes to extend to North Carolina and other sites  with longstanding African-American populations.</p>
        <p>At Howard University in Washington, a geneticist announced this spring that he would offer DNA analysis, possibly as early as this summer, to African-Americans seeking their ancestors' homelands, at $200 or $300 per test. He has since withdrawn that price and moved back his starting date to next year.</p>
        <p>And in Manhattan, the African Burial Ground project has been assembling a database of the DNA of African-Americans buried long ago on what is now the site of an office building. The project has also been gathering the DNA of living Africans to help determine where those buried on the site might have come from. It is open to expanding the database to help the living find their past, project scientists say.</p>
        <p>Most likely, the ability to ''show reasonably accurate probabilities of association'' between living African-Americans and African cultures will be possible in two years or so, given enough financing, said Dr. Michael L. Blakey, director of the project.</p>
        <p>The efforts may be disparate, but this much seems clear: Powerful new gene technology is being enlisted in black Americans' search for their African ancestry, and it promises some answers.</p>
        <p>''The greatest travesty for African-Americans is not the diseases we suffer, not the sickle-cell and high blood pressure, nor is it the social injustices we have to face, it is that we are disconnected from our beginnings,'' said Bruce Jackson, director of the biotechnology and DNA forensics programs at Massachusetts Bay Community College, and the leader of the project that is to involve Boston schoolchildren.</p>
        <p>''We have no connection to where we came from,'' Dr. Jackson said,  ''and that is an affliction which has followed us for centuries. It really has to end.''</p>
        <p>The idea behind the DNA projects is that analysts can look for telltale sequences in African-Americans' genes that also appear in the current populations of various African regions, and thus link the Americans to their probable point of origin.</p>
        <p>Scientists emphasize, however, that this DNA analysis is not enough to provide decisive evidence for a link to a homeland and that other fields of knowledge are essential, including history and ethnology; also, it will take time to develop the extensive databases needed to encompass enough people and enough areas of Africa. Researchers are tapping their African colleagues for help in gathering those data.</p>
        <p>Such limitations contributed to some of the hubbub that arose in recent months over the publicized plans of Rick Kittles, a geneticist at Howard University, to offer individual DNA-based origin-finding to African-Americans for a fee. In newspaper reports this spring, he was quoted as saying it would cost $200 or $300 and perhaps begin this summer; a Web site, www.africanancestry.com, promotes the project.</p>
        <p>Objections arose from many quarters, including scientists who said the databases were not good enough yet to provide findings meaningful enough to market. Others argued that it was immoral to charge victims of slavery for determining their homelands.</p>
        <p>Dr. Blakey of the African Burial Ground Project, where Dr. Kittles had worked until last year, warned that the database still had major gaps and technical problems. He also expressed unease about the seeming commercial nature of Dr. Kittles's  African Ancestry project.</p>
        <p>''It certainly seems to be a questionable matter that a former researcher should take part of our program currently in development and do what he is doing,'' Dr. Blakey said of Dr. Kittles.</p>
        <p>In general, said Thomas J. Parsons, the chief of research at the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory, who is not involved in the projects, such databases are of scientific interest and constitute ''a very interesting way of relating populations that exist in the U.S. to potential progenitor populations in Africa.''</p>
        <p>But consider, Dr. Parsons added, the limitations on what can be learned from mitochondrial DNA, which is one of two types of DNA the projects are using because they are passed down virtually unchanged. The mitochondrial DNA goes from mother to daughter and Y-chromosome DNA follows the male line.</p>
        <p>If, for example, Dr. Parsons said, an African-American man is seeking to trace his mitochondrial DNA to the lineage of his great-great-great-great-great-grandmother, he may succeed, but that woman would have contributed only 1/128th of his genetic composition. And ''what that means in terms of who you are is: it's only a small portion of a potentially giant admixture,'' the rest of which would still be undetermined, he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kittles has also acknowledged that, although the project is meant to trace African origins, it is likely to turn up a great deal of European lineage, because slave owners and other whites interbred with African-Americans.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kittles has declined interview requests in recent weeks. University officials first said that he was too busy. Then they said he could not comment because, as Donna Brock, a university spokeswoman, put it, ''his work is incomplete and has not been peer-reviewed.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Kittles did speak a few words this week, when asked in a brief telephone interview whether he would be working with Dr. Jackson, the Boston molecular biologist. ''I'm not collaborating with him at all as it relates to African-American ancestry,'' Dr. Kittles said. As for his own project, Dr. Kittles said, ''We're still working out the logistics, we're still working on the research.'' He did not elaborate on what the financial arrangements would be.</p>
        <p>''It's definitely coming,'' he said of his project. ''If you look at what I said before, it will do what I said.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Jackson said he and Dr. Kittles had talked, and that he hoped they could work together. Dr. Jackson is the head of what he called the only degree-granting program in the country on DNA forensic science, at Massachusetts Bay Community College, and an assistant professor at Boston University.</p>
        <p>He said he had dreamed for years of creating a database that could let him and other African-Americans find their genetic roots. He had been crestfallen to read this spring that Dr. Kittles had already begun such an effort but decided to proceed anyway, he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jackson plans to collect DNA samples from Boston as well as the islands off North Carolina and other sites with centuries-old African-American populations, he said, and build a DNA database with thousands of profiles. He is seeking money for the project through grants and foundations.</p>
        <p>''We hope to have kids take an active part in determining their ancestry and also get an interest in science at an age when they can,'' Dr. Jackson said. ''We want to do both.''</p>
        <p>It will be some time before anyone is likely to find matches in the database, he said, but with the Boston schoolchildren, who are participating as part of a voluntary after-school program, ''We'll take a wild shot in the dark with them -- a prayerful shot in the dark.''</p>
        <p>At the African Burial Ground project, Dr. Blakey said the goal of the DNA database was to analyze the  remains of those buried. Once that has been done, he said, the database  ''will be available for the people, as many members of the public had asked.''</p>
        <p>The African Burial Ground project is being financed by the Federal General Services Administration, which  built the office tower at the site.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Dr. Blakey said, using DNA to indicate their origins could prove healing for African-Americans and ''help restore the specifics of identity that were deliberately damaged by slaveholders in order to make enslaved Africans seem less human.''</p>
