        <p>In an effort to give media planners more information about advertising patterns online, a study to be released today found that a majority of online advertisements had short life spans, running three weeks or less.</p>
        <p>Perhaps in keeping with the short attention spans of most Internet users, 23.7 percent of all online advertisements run one week, while 16 percent run two weeks, and 11.9 percent run three weeks, the study found.</p>

        <p>In an effort to give media planners more information about advertising patterns online, a study to be released today found that a majority of online advertisements had short life spans, running three weeks or less.</p>
        <p>Perhaps in keeping with the short attention spans of most Internet users, 23.7 percent of all online advertisements run one week, while 16 percent run two weeks, and 11.9 percent run three weeks, the study found.</p>
        <p>What is more, most advertisers reach a very small audience, the study said, with a huge majority getting less than a 0.01 percent share among all online advertisements running at a particular time.</p>
        <p>The study, done by AdRelevance, a unit of the Internet measuring service Media Metrix, analyzed standard ad banners on the top 500 Web sites, as determined by Media Metrix, between July 1999 and June 2000.</p>
        <p>Charles Buchwalter, vice president for media research for AdRelevance and an author of the study, said the findings indicated that advertisers were using online ads more for short-term direct marketing than to create brand awareness. ''As time goes by,'' he said, ''the average duration of campaigns will start increasing as people understand more about the brand impact.''</p>
        <p>The survey did find differences in the length of online campaigns run by various industries. While the auto industry scheduled online ads to run the longest, an average 7.8 weeks, the duration for a hardware and electronics ad was 4.1 weeks.</p>
        <p>In addition to the auto industry, financial services and travel companies tended to run longer campaigns, which Mr. Buchwalter attributed to the fact that these industries usually had more experience with offline and online advertising and generally had longer media planning cycles.</p>
        <p>The study also found that the average online ad campaign in the second quarter of 2000 registered 7,265,000 impressions, a measure of the number of times an ad is viewed. But more than half of all advertisers ran campaigns that registered fewer than 44,000 impressions in the second quarter, equivalent to about 0.0003 percent of all ads displayed in that period on a site like Yahoo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchwalter said that over all, the study's findings reflected the fact that advertisers were still learning what works best in a relatively new medium. ''With all the growth that is happening in the online ad industry,''  he said, ''It's still in its infancy.''</p>
        <p>In a separate survey released this month, AdRelevance found the average cost for 1,000 ad banners was $30 to $31. That compares with $33 six months ago.</p>
