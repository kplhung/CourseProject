        <p>Editorial on automobile safety in view of Ford Motor Co decision to cut production of its Ford Explorer utility vehicles in connection with Bridgestone/Firestone recall of 6.5 million tires and Mitsubishi Motors' expanded recall and admission that it has systematically concealed customer complaints about tens of thousands of defective vehicles; says Congress may need to mandate that manufacturers report all lawsuits, recalls and serious customer complaints to regulators</p>

        <p>It has been a dismal month for those concerned about motor vehicle safety, but it brightened just a bit last week when two of the world's major automobile manufacturers took corrective action to restore consumer confidence. First the Ford Motor Company decided to cut production of its popular Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles so as to free their tires to help replace those being recalled for safety reasons on existing vehicles. Some 6.5 million Bridgestone/Firestone tires are being recalled after being linked to hundreds of accidents and 46 deaths in the United States alone.</p>
        <p>Then, Mitsubishi Motors, Japan's No. 4 automaker, admitted that it has systematically concealed customer complaints about tens of thousands of defective automobiles since 1977. Middle-level officials, anxious to avoid embarrassing recalls, covered up complaints about fuel tanks, brakes and clutches, simply by altering or hiding documents. Top management says it never knew about it. The company expanded a recall of the faulty vehicles, most of which were sold in Japan.</p>

        <p>It has been a dismal month for those concerned about motor vehicle safety, but it brightened just a bit last week when two of the world's major automobile manufacturers took corrective action to restore consumer confidence. First the Ford Motor Company decided to cut production of its popular Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles so as to free their tires to help replace those being recalled for safety reasons on existing vehicles. Some 6.5 million Bridgestone/Firestone tires are being recalled after being linked to hundreds of accidents and 46 deaths in the United States alone.</p>
        <p>Then, Mitsubishi Motors, Japan's No. 4 automaker, admitted that it has systematically concealed customer complaints about tens of thousands of defective automobiles since 1977. Middle-level officials, anxious to avoid embarrassing recalls, covered up complaints about fuel tanks, brakes and clutches, simply by altering or hiding documents. Top management says it never knew about it. The company expanded a recall of the faulty vehicles, most of which were sold in Japan.</p>
        <p>Ford's decision to halt production will be costly. Ford will suspend Explorer production at its big St. Louis plant, as well as production of Ford Ranger pickup trucks at two other plants. These are very profitable vehicles, and Ford estimates its pretax loss at up to $140 million. The shutdowns will last until Sept. 11, giving the supply of replacement tires time to begin catching up with demand.</p>
        <p>The decision made good business and legal sense. Ford would have been vulnerable to lawsuits had it continued to mount tires on new Explorers at a time when drivers of old Explorers needed replacements for the tires Firestone recalled.</p>
        <p>Despite the many claims sent to Bridgestone/ Firestone by warranty-holders, the company said it did not detect a pattern of failure that required special attention. But when Ford ran the same claims through its own computers, it discovered not only an unusually high number of complaints but also the source of most of the problem tires -- a factory in Decatur, Ill., operated from 1994 to 1996 by replacement workers. Ford says that from now on it will inspect warranty data on all the tires it installs on its cars, instead of depending on the tire manufacturer to supply that information.</p>
        <p>But Ford's own performance remained under critical scrutiny. By week's end, Ford was being rebuked by Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater for failing to notify regulators promptly last year when it recalled the Firestone tires on some of its vehicles overseas. Congress, which will hold hearings next month, may need to mandate that manufacturers report all lawsuits, recalls and serious customer complaints to the regulators.</p>
