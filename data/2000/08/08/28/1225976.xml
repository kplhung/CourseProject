        <p>Thursday evening's Mostly Mozart concert at Alice Tully Hall was, once more, Boldly Bach, the entire program being given over to the four suites the older master wrote at different times in his career for performances in palaces and cafes. Modern scholarship tends to favor the notion that, like the ''Brandenburg'' Concertos, these works were written for soloists to play, and that was how they were done here by the New London Consort.</p>
        <p>The first and second suites thereby became chamber music, the latter performed by just a string quartet and harpsichord plus the solo flute. In the third and fourth suites -- both exuberant pieces in D major, with oboes, trumpets and timpani taking part -- the number of players rose to 12 or so, conducted by the Consort's director, Philip Pickett.</p>

        <p>Thursday evening's Mostly Mozart concert at Alice Tully Hall was, once more, Boldly Bach, the entire program being given over to the four suites the older master wrote at different times in his career for performances in palaces and cafes. Modern scholarship tends to favor the notion that, like the ''Brandenburg'' Concertos, these works were written for soloists to play, and that was how they were done here by the New London Consort.</p>
        <p>The first and second suites thereby became chamber music, the latter performed by just a string quartet and harpsichord plus the solo flute. In the third and fourth suites -- both exuberant pieces in D major, with oboes, trumpets and timpani taking part -- the number of players rose to 12 or so, conducted by the Consort's director, Philip Pickett.</p>
        <p>Sonorities and textures in these larger works, with winds outnumbering strings by almost two to one, were curiously reminiscent of the 20th century, as represented by, say, Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony. It was almost as if the 19th century had never happened. And perhaps this is how musical culture will develop, presenting ever more and closer connections between modern and earlier times, with the 19th century -- once central -- becoming the great exception.</p>
        <p>These performances, however, were not such as to make any large claims, whether in terms of inherent musical expression or of wider implications. Possibly because of the humid weather, the players experienced difficulties in gaining full, fine control over intonation and sound. Their problems diminished as the evening went on, but did not disappear.</p>
        <p>Nor did the performances get very much livelier or more engaging. In certain passages and even in some whole movements, the players would seem to realize suddenly that zest was expected of them and was possible: the second Bourree of the fourth suite was one such bright moment, with suave oboes, a bubbling bassoon and deft touches from the violins. A lot of the rest, though, was routine.</p>
        <p>There were some admirable players on the platform, including Adrian Chandler, the first violinist, and Dorothea Seel, who was a graceful and gentle flute soloist in the second suite. Mr. Pickett, too, is an expert musician. But this was a disappointing occasion.</p>
