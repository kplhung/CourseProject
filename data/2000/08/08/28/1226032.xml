        <p>Joe Torre intends to return as the Yankees' manager next year, the last season of his current contract, and he said today he hadn't ruled out the possibility of managing in 2002 or beyond.</p>
        <p>''I'm assuming I'm coming back,'' he said. ''And being under contract, in my mind, I'm going to manage next year, because that's what I'm under contract to do.''</p>
        <p>Torre could have left the Yankees last year, when he was treated for prostate cancer, but he came back for this season. ''I'm probably more interested in coming back this year than I was last year,'' he said, referring to his plans for the upcoming season, ''only because health-wise, I'd come through a lot emotionally, and I had to think about it a little bit. But this year, it's like, 'This is my job and that's what I'm going to do until I decide not to work.'</p>
        <p>''I'm having fun,'' Torre said. ''You work your whole life to get to that point, you work to make that choice, and it's your choice. I'm fortunate at this point in time, that when it stops being fun, I'd think I'd be content enough to move on. But right now, I'm enjoying it. I still enjoy winning. I still have the fire in my belly, and that's the important thing. Plus my wife is wonderful: She wants me to retire right now, but not if this is something I want to do. She's been saying that for three years.''</p>
        <p>Torre said he hadn't thought about whether to manage in 2002. ''But I'll tell you one thing, I haven't dismissed it either,'' he said while sitting in the visitors' dugout of the Network Associates Coliseum. ''Once you make that decision, that's probably it. It's not like I would leave the game for five years and come back at 65.''</p>
        <p>A columnist speculated in Newsday this morning that Torre had become fed up with the management style of George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner. ''I don't think I've ever said that to anybody,'' Torre said. ''I don't feel any different than I did a year ago, or even two years ago, for that matter. Five years ago, over the last couple of years, I've gotten into a comfort zone of knowing what it's like here. I don't think that has changed since I've settled into that.''</p>
        <p>A couple of weeks ago, Steinbrenner released a statement that subtly chastised Torre after he did not publicly embrace the acquisition of the slugger Jose Canseco. At the time, Torre was asked about this and responded simply that Steinbrenner was the boss, effectively defusing a potentially explosive situation. Neither Torre nor Steinbrenner has discussed that matter since, and they have maintained communication. ''In fact, I was talking to George yesterday morning,'' Torre said. ''We're fine.''</p>
        <p>Torre did not seem as sure about whether Don Zimmer, his bench coach for five seasons, would be back. Zimmer has been hobbled for almost two years by knee trouble. ''I don't know,'' Torre said, grimacing a bit. ''Every year it's the same thing. He's had a tough year physically this year, the knee didn't respond.'' Torre said he hoped Zimmer would return.</p>
        <p>Torre mentioned that whenever he retires, he would think about going into broadcasting, something he did before resuming his managerial career with the St. Louis Cardinals. He will also become eligible to be selected by the Veterans Committee for baseball's Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>''The Hall of Fame, if that ever happens, would be a wonderful honor,'' he said. ''But after waiting as long as I did to get to the World Series and then winning, God, it's going to have to go a long way to make me feel as good as that did -- or does now, after winning two more.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill Still in Pain</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder, is out indefinitely with a hip pointer that has not improved. O'Neill, who has not played since last Tuesday, took batting practice today, tried running and then walked off the field disconsolately. He received a shot of cortisone before today's game.</p>
        <p>''I want to get out there,'' said O'Neill, who could play Wednesday. ''The last few days, I didn't get to where I wanted to be. Hopefully, this will knock it out and we'll get on with it.''</p>
        <p>Torre suggested before the game that if O'Neill's condition did not improve, the outfielder may return to New York for rest and treatment. ''I know he's getting frustrated with it,'' Torre said. ''He's a guy who's used to being able to play.''</p>
        <p>Ramiro Mendoza, on the disabled list with weakness in the back of his right shoulder, will throw off a mound this week as part of his effort to rejoin the team by mid-September.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are likely to add outfielder Ryan Thompson from Class AAA Columbus when the major league rosters expand on Sept. 1.</p>
