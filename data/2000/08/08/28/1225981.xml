        <p>Googoosh kept having to wipe tears from her eyes when she performed on Saturday night at the Nassau Coliseum. So did many of her fans. Googoosh, who was Iran's queen of pop in the 1970's, was performing again after 21 years of public silence and seclusion, the 21 years since Iran's Islamic revolutionary government came to power and banned nearly all music.</p>
        <p>In prerevolutionary Iran, Googoosh was Iran's Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Cher, Edith Piaf and Madonna rolled into one: not just a magnificent singer but a fashion trailblazer and a symbol of modernity. Her songs were romantic, not political, and while they drew on Western styles, they held onto both the fervor of Persian love poetry and the sliding, quivering, impassioned phrasing of traditional Persian music.</p>

        <p>Googoosh kept having to wipe tears from her eyes when she performed on Saturday night at the Nassau Coliseum. So did many of her fans. Googoosh, who was Iran's queen of pop in the 1970's, was performing again after 21 years of public silence and seclusion, the 21 years since Iran's Islamic revolutionary government came to power and banned nearly all music.</p>
        <p>In prerevolutionary Iran, Googoosh was Iran's Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Cher, Edith Piaf and Madonna rolled into one: not just a magnificent singer but a fashion trailblazer and a symbol of modernity. Her songs were romantic, not political, and while they drew on Western styles, they held onto both the fervor of Persian love poetry and the sliding, quivering, impassioned phrasing of traditional Persian music.</p>
        <p>Although Googoosh stopped singing and performing, her old songs stayed popular both among Iranian expatriates and, sold illegally, within Iran. Like the Buena Vista Social Club from Cuba, she now carries forward music from a prerevolutionary era that has taken on new connotations.</p>
        <p>Her songs about eternal love and the pain of separation have, two decades later, become not just vows of devotion but invocations of nostalgia, longing and, for Iranians in North America, the pain of exile. They also hint at a cultural path Iran rejected, one that it may resume under its current reformist government: not trying to seal itself off from Western pop culture, but using Western elements to create something distinctly Persian.</p>
        <p>This year Googoosh, who is now 50, was given permission to tour abroad, where she will also make movies directed by her husband, Massoud Kimiai. (In Iran women are still not allowed to sing as soloists for audiences that include men.) Onstage Googoosh had all the trappings of a Western pop diva: giant video screens, scaffolding full of lights and an eight-violin string section along with her pop-rock band. But she was decidedly modest, wearing long dresses and gesturing almost entirely with graceful arms and hands, restraining herself from motion below the shoulders. For her encore she came back barefoot. It was an uptempo song, and she was shaking with, apparently, the suppressed urge to dance, until she allowed herself a final kick.</p>
        <p>Her voice is intact: lustrous, supple, full of heartache and tender determination. Songs rose to imperious declarations, then turned gentle in the course of a sustained note. Where many Western divas work their way through songs until they get a chance to let loose and belt, Googoosh treats the peaks of her songs like a Persian singer, letting notes slide and cascade as if her melodies were melting in the heat of her emotion.</p>
        <p>Every old song brought shouts and ululations of recognition, and many audience members sang every word. In lyrics suffused with imagery from nature, Googoosh sang about love so luxuriant it could make the desert bloom, so joyful it could fill the air with bird songs. There were bouncy tunes that harked back to 1960's bubble-gum and spy-movie themes. There were uptempo songs that seemed to be rooted in old Persian dance rhythms, and others with a touch of disco. There were cabaret-style ballads with Romantic piano flourishes. And there were slow songs, accompanied only by a piano or a guitar, that Googoosh sang with elaborate Middle Eastern ornamentation and a melancholy dignity.</p>
        <p>She has just released a new album, ''Zoroaster'' (Kia Entertainment), that updates her music; she performed one new song on Saturday that used flamenco guitar along the lines of the Gipsy Kings. A few of her new songs also hinted at messages that were not only personal.</p>
        <p>One, which can be translated from the Farsi as ''The Captive Soil'' or ''The Captive Land,'' was about having her heart torn into tiny pieces; at the end in a spoken coda she said, ''I have a million sisters like 50 suns shining, and a million brothers, who are green and red around me.'' The Iranian flag is red, green and white. She continued, ''Imprisonment was cold/I have patience that is old/I have love that is warm.'' And in ''Zoroaster,'' the album's title song, she sang about crying for the children of war, and promised, ''I will lend my voice to history.''</p>
        <p>What such declarations mean in Iran, to which Googoosh has said she will return, is impossible to determine from abroad. For fans who never expected to see her perform again, her reappearance was cause enough for gratitude.</p>
