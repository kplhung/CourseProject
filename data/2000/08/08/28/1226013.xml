        <p>When this summer to forget began, the Knicks had four items on their to-do list, and trading Patrick Ewing was not one of them.</p>
        <p>They wanted to acquire Grant Hill -- a long shot, they knew, but one they hoped a videotaped presentation featuring some of their celebrity fans and the many opportunities that New York City presented Hill's songstress wife, Tamia, might actually make happen.</p>
        <p>They also wanted to obtain a rugged power forward who would catapult them from the bottom of the league's offensive rebounding ranking, and improve themselves at point guard by acquiring a penetrating playmaker who would end the every-basket-is-a-war nature of their halfcourt set. Beyond that, in what would have been a bonus, the Knicks hoped to get a small forward with touch from the outside.</p>
        <p>But an off-season that began with cheery optimism and grand aspirations has degenerated into one of the franchise's most fruitless and embarrassing summers in recent memory. Not only have the Knicks failed to reach even one of their goals, but their well-publicized string of near misses has left them facing a potential disaster, one that nothing less than complete and selfless professionalism on the part of their players can avert. In a profession where egotism abounds, and to a degree is beneficial, the Knicks must grudgingly check theirs at the doors of the College of Charleston at the start of training camp in October.</p>
        <p>Last week's sloppy handling of the Ewing saga -- in which the great center was essentially traded, castigated by the public and the news media and then untraded -- has left the Knicks in the awkward position of having to coexist with an angry and humiliated star who is growing old ungracefully. But there are also the potentially bruised egos of some of Ewing's teammates. Who knows how feeling unappreciated and perhaps unwanted could affect the games of Marcus Camby, Chris Childs, Larry Johnson and Allan Houston?</p>
        <p>Camby, a rising star a year ago, watched in silent aggravation as the Knicks all but drooled over Brian Grant and then battled the Golden State Warriors for Danny Fortson, both of whom threatened to slice his already limited minutes. As for Childs and Johnson, they must know that the Knicks have shopped them and their burdensome contracts all over the place, only to find no takers. And while Houston knows he is valued by the club he is also smart enough to realize that the Knicks' fascination with Glen Rice most likely meant they had intentions of dealing him for a power player up front.</p>
        <p>The potential for debilitating discontent in the locker room is so strong that before figuring out a way to squeeze more offensive rebounding out of the same old crew, Jeff Van Gundy must take into account that five of his top players -- including three starters -- know that if the Knicks had their druthers, they would be elsewhere. A coach whose team always seems to be embroiled in turmoil could be facing his toughest challenge yet.</p>
        <p>''It's really going to test their professionalism and Van Gundy's professionalism,'' said one Eastern Conference coach, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''Van Gundy is good at turning a negative into a positive and that's what he'll have to do in this case.''</p>
        <p>Making matters worse is that while General Manager Scott Layden's every plan was being foiled, the Miami Heat, the Knicks' fiercest rival, was emerging as one of the champions of the off-season. While Layden found himself shackled by the Knicks' surplus of high salary-low production players, Pat Riley found ways to pull off two complicated trades that landed Eddie Jones, Anthony Mason and the coveted Grant.</p>
        <p>But while on the surface there appears to be little reason to feel good about the Knicks, Layden's statement to the news media on Thursday that ''we feel good about our chances'' was not totally baseless. Hope can be justified.</p>
        <p>Though Ewing is upset about remaining in New York and probably hurt by the mean-spirited boot out of town he was about to receive, he is, even so, one of the hardest working and most professional players in the league. He has performed admirably in light of public scorn and perceived slights by the organization before and will probably do so again. And even if Ewing's bitterness is too deep, his desire to earn big money for two more years after this season will force him to put forth his best effort on the court.</p>
        <p>For the Knicks to recapture the magic of two seasons ago, it is imperative that Ewing and his humbled teammates behave as professionals, shaking off the off-season affronts and just playing ball.</p>
        <p>Camby, as he was in the 1999 playoffs, could be the X-factor, but only if he thickens his skin and ignores the Knicks' pursuit of front-line reinforcements, or in Grant's case replacements, and stays healthy. Before his plague of injuries began in late November, Camby averaged 15 points and 10.3 rebounds through the first six games while starting at center for the injured Ewing. But when he returned from the injuries, he did so without his explosiveness, and the Knicks were much the worse for it.</p>
        <p>It is possible that an injury free Camby, who is expected to be 100 percent for training camp, can re-energize the Knicks, particularly on the offensive glass. If that happens, it will be as if the Knicks did add a new player this summer, and that would go a long way in eliminating the distress of this off-season of disappointment and adversity.</p>
