        <p>Dennis O'Sullivan's name was buried on the list of 10 players the Jets cut Saturday to reduce their roster to 53. While the release of safety Omar Stoutmire was the biggest -- perhaps the only -- surprise, it was the jettisoning of O'Sullivan, the long snapper, that set up a bigger scramble.</p>
        <p>The uncertainty at free safety is nothing new for the Jets. If Scott Frost starts against Green Bay on Sunday, as is now expected, he will be the Jets' 11th different starter at the position since Ronnie Lott left in 1994.</p>
        <p>But the line of succession is not so clear at long snapper. O'Sullivan was inconsistent, delivering a high snap to punter Tom Tupa in the preseason opener against New Orleans. Tupa's kick was returned for a touchdown. O'Sullivan also looked shaky against Baltimore by making on two bad snaps. The Jets are not used to such miscues. Until this season, they had enjoyed the flawless work of John Hudson, a 10-year veteran who snapped, and only snapped, with extraordinary precision.</p>
        <p>The Jets say that Hudson never made a bad snap in four seasons with the team, about 600 of them on punts, extra points and field goals. Now, Hudson could be headed back to New York. Hudson's agent, Jim Steiner, said yesterday that the Jets had talked to him about the possible return of Hudson, who has been practicing on his own at his Tennessee farm.</p>
        <p>But, Steiner said, the Jets also indicated that they wanted to see whether there was someone who could snap in addition to playing another position.</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh is a firm believer in players who can perform more than one job, so O'Sullivan's -- and Hudson's -- specialization may work against them. If the Jets are to sign Hudson, they would have to release another player to remain at 53. The only snapper currently on the Jets is Kevin Mawae, the starting center, who has told coaches he does not want to do long snaps.</p>
        <p>''I think it will be based on who else will be available and whether they can find someone who can play a position and snap and save them a roster spot,'' Steiner said.</p>
        <p>Hudson wants to return, Steiner said, but the salary cap is a consideration. Hudson would make the veteran minimum of $440,000. O'Sullivan would have earned the minimum for a first-year player, $193,000.</p>
        <p>Brisby Settles In</p>
        <p>How big an impression has Vincent Brisby made in his brief time with the Jets? Since being signed less than two weeks ago, Brisby has vaulted into the No. 3 receiver spot. Brisby, who was picked up after being cut by the Patriots, made Yatil Green expendable Saturday and gained the trust of quarterback Vinny Testaverde.</p>
        <p>Brisby, who played against the Giants and caught two passes for 30 yards, is familiar with the Jets' offense. New England has been practicing it since the former Jets offensive coordinator Charlie Weis, who followed Bill Belichick to the Patriots, installed it.</p>
        <p>Testaverde has spent training camp trying to develop with other receivers the same chemistry he enjoys with Wayne Chrebet. While the rookies Laveranues Coles and Windrell Hayes struggled, Brisby stood out.</p>
        <p>''In the short amount of time I've had to work with him, I feel very comfortable with him,'' Testaverde said. ''He's very quarterback-friendly. Knowing where to slide away to the void area of the defense, how to set up your man to create separation. Those are the things that make a picture clear for the quarterback.''</p>
