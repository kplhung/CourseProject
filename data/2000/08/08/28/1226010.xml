        <p>PLAYING for Segovia in the plains in Spain, and for Parma and Alcamo amid the hills of Italy, she had dreamed a fading dream of one day playing professional basketball in America, maybe in Los Angeles where she grew up in Watts -- or, well, anywhere in the States, especially so that her mother, Mary Cobb, could see her play regularly.

        <p>PLAYING for Segovia in the plains in Spain, and for Parma and Alcamo amid the hills of Italy, she had dreamed a fading dream of one day playing professional basketball in America, maybe in Los Angeles where she grew up in Watts -- or, well, anywhere in the States, especially so that her mother, Mary Cobb, could see her play regularly. So that her mother could see that she had truly made something of herself.</p>
        <p>Above all, she said, she had wished to make her mother proud, her mother who had raised her and her seven siblings on her own.</p>
        <p>She had been instrumental in the University of Southern California making four trips to the Final Four, and winning two national championships, but in 1987 there were no professional leagues for women here. So she packed her sneakers and her aspirations and went off to Europe to earn a living at what she did best.</p>
        <p>The young woman had been playing in Europe for 10 years, been a star there -- league-leading scorer or second in each of those years -- but she was 33 years old. ''I knew that one day there would be a women's professional basketball league in America,'' Cynthia Cooper said, ''but I thought it would pass me by.''</p>
        <p>She was wrong. In January of 1997, Cynthia Cooper came home, signing with Houston of the fledgling Women's National Basketball Association. Four seasons later, she has established herself here as not only one of the most exciting of contemporary athletes, but also one of the grittiest.</p>
        <p>''Cynthia Cooper is the Michael Jordan, the Larry Bird, the Magic Johnson of this league,'' Rich Adubato, the coach of the New York Liberty, said. ''She's the type of person who will not let her team lose.'' He said this with full respect and full regrets, since Cooper had just hit a twisting scoop shot to seal the victory against his team in the first game of the W.N.B.A. finals Thursday in Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>In the league's four seasons, Cooper was the league's most valuable player in the first two, and the M.V.P. in each of its championship series, all won by the Houston Comets. She had been the league scoring leader in each of the first three seasons, averaging more than 22 points a game each time.</p>
        <p>At the end of last week, with the Comets ahead by 1-0 in the two-of-three-game title series against the Liberty, they had a chance to win their fourth straight championship. The end of the road for her, Cooper had said.</p>
        <p>In July, Cooper, the lithe, 5-foot-10-inch guard with the short ponytail that appears to help propel her, had announced that she was retiring after this season. No longer would crowds thrill to her running one-hander in traffic that banks so sweetly off the backboard, or see her move as stealthily as a fox to a hen's egg as she picks off a pass.</p>
        <p>Cooper was reflecting on this Saturday morning, shortly before Game 2 of the W.N.B.A. finals in Houston. What will she do when she retires? Could she ever duplicate the excitement of basketball? ''No,'' she said, ''and I don't expect to. I don't think anything can duplicate playing before 20,000 people, who are screaming for you or at you. And nothing can duplicate the pressure that you feel building before a big game like this, or being on the free-throw line and having to make important free throws, or the big shot.</p>
        <p>''But it's time to move on,'' she said. ''I'll just have to redirect my energies beyond the basketball court. I have a lot of interests. I might try broadcasting or coaching. I have a foundation that I want to spend more time with.'' She was referring to the Mary Cobb's Building Dreams Foundation, which helps raise funds for breast cancer research. She is also involved with inner-city youth.</p>
        <p>Then, in Game 2 on Saturday, when the crunch came, she rose in customary fashion to the occasion. She sank a 3-point shot with 21.5 seconds to go in the game to tie it at 64-64 and send it into overtime. In the extra five-minute period, she scored on a drive and one of her patented runners -- she had 25 points -- to help give the Comets a lead they would not relinquish in a 79-73 victory.</p>
        <p>Then, fittingly, she grabbed a defensive rebound with just seconds to go and she dribbled out the clock. When the buzzer blared, she ran in little circles, and into the crowd, cradling the ball in one hand and with the other waving four fingers, indicating the number of W.N.B.A. titles won.</p>
        <p>Watching the Comets' victory celebration, as the confetti rained onto the court like the deluge on Noah's ark, one recalled a moment before the game. In the locker room, Cooper had talked about some tough times, last year being one of the worst, when both her mother and a dear friend and teammate, Kim Perrot, had died of cancer.</p>
        <p>''It takes a toll on you,'' Cooper said. ''I can just see mom jumping up and down when we won our championships, when she saw me being successful, how much she'd love to have been here now.'' Cooper paused. ''I'd better stop before I start crying. . . . I'm, I'm just eternally grateful. . . .''</p>
        <p>She turned away. ''O.K.,'' she said, her voice cracking slightly, ''that's enough.''</p>
        <p>Not quite. But 40 game-minutes later -- no, 45 minutes, including the overtime  -- it was, finally, enough.</p>
