        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio took his Senate campaign almost literally to Hillary Rodham Clinton's backyard today, appearing at a fund-raiser at a private home four miles from Mrs. Clinton's new house.</p>
        <p>And, as is typical in this contentious race, he had some un-neighborly words for his opponent, who moved here just seven months ago.</p>
        <p>''I don't look at New York as being Mrs. Clinton's neighborhood,'' Mr. Lazio said when asked how it felt to stand just four miles from the house President and Mrs. Clinton bought here in December to establish residency for her Senate bid.</p>
        <p>But, as he dashed off to begin the fund-raiser, he added with a grin, ''It's great to be here in Chappaqua.''</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Lazio's first trip here, but aides would not rule out a follow-up visit to the community, which voted for President Clinton in the last two elections. Recent polls have shown Mr. Lazio doing well in the New York City suburbs, a swing battleground fruitful in votes and money. The fund-raiser here was one of four he attended in and near Westchester County.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was not in town during Mr. Lazio's two-hour visit, which also included an unscheduled stop at a downtown pizzeria.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazio certainly has a friend in the host of the fund-raiser, Ed O'Keefe, a retired corporate lawyer and chairman of the New Castle Republican Committee. (Chappaqua is a village within the town of New Castle; those who pay taxes to its school district, like Mr. O'Keefe and Mrs. Clinton, consider themselves residents of the village, though the incorporated town is New Castle.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides said he did not schedule the fund-raiser here deliberately to tweak the first lady. Mr. O'Keefe said he offered to hold it as a loyal Republican ''because I thought it was time for Rick to come up here to Chappaqua to say hello to the folks.'' Mr. O'Keefe estimated that 130 people, paying on average $300, would attend. (As usual, campaign officials declined to give the actual attendance or total raised.)</p>
        <p>It was clear the Lazio campaign relished the idea of Mr. Lazio's stomping on Mrs. Clinton's turf; his fund-raisers are usually closed to the news media. But this time, after word spread Mr. Lazio would be in Chappaqua, his campaign office called a brief news conference on Mr. O'Keefe's lawn before the event.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, for his part, said he would talk up his plan to cut taxes by $776 billion over 10 years, an issue that has dominated the campaign since Mr. Lazio unveiled it Thursday in his first major policy address.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio defended the plan again today, attacking Mrs. Clinton for asserting that his numbers understate the impact on the economy. Mrs. Clinton says Mr. Lazio's plan would actually cost $1.24 trillion, an amount she said would threaten the surplus, drive up interest rates and destroy the economic boom.</p>
        <p>''They are in fantasyland,'' Mr. Lazio told reporters. ''They have no plan. All they can do is attack and pull down and rip apart.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton does have a tax-fighting plan, though more modest than Mr. Lazio's. Hers amounts to about $496 billion in cuts over 10 years, a less risky course, she says.</p>
        <p>''His first plan is a big tax scheme that just doesn't add up,'' Mrs. Clinton told supporters at a rally in Kingston, N.Y., today, citing reports in Newsday and The Daily News today that assert that some of Mr. Lazio's figures are wrong. She also accused the congressman of trying ''to be Bush Lite'' with his plan.</p>
        <p>Asked to comment on Mr. Lazio's visit and his remark about New York's not being Mrs. Clinton's neighborhood, her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, replied, ''Congressman Lazio can't defend his phony tax plan, so he has to resort to personal insults.''</p>
