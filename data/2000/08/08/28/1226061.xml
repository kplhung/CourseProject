        <p>Tiger Woods won the race against nightfall, winning $1 million in the process.</p>
        <p>Playing the last few holes in near darkness, Woods cruised to an 11-stroke victory today in the NEC Invitational and set a tournament scoring record that added to his remarkable year. Woods was 21 under par for the tournament (259, 64-61-67-67), breaking the record (262) set by Jose Maria Olazabal in 1990.</p>
        <p>Justin Leonard, who shot a four-under-par 66, and Phillip Price of Wales, who shot 68, tied for second place at 10 under par, each winning $437,000 in this 37-player World Golf Championships event with a $5 million purse.</p>
        <p>It was Woods's second consecutive victory, his fifth in his last seven starts, and his eighth in 16 starts on the PGA Tour this year. How can a professional golfer win 50 percent of the tour events he has played? How could Woods not only avoid a letdown after winning the P.G.A. Championship, but also dominate a world-class field a week later?</p>
        <p>What Woods has done this year almost defies belief, yet he continues to take his game to new levels while leaving the competition farther behind. Today, after a nearly three-hour delay because of stormy weather that threatened to extend the tournament until Monday, Woods ended the tournament with another magic moment. At the par-4 No. 18, Woods hit a spectacular 8-iron approach shot from 169 yards that landed 2 feet from the pin. It was almost impossible to see the pin from where Woods was standing in the fairway, yet he hit a near-perfect shot that set up an easy birdie.</p>
        <p>''It reminded me of how I played growing up, playing a few holes trying to beat the dark,'' Woods said. ''Because of the lead I had, everyone wanted to finish. I guarantee if it had been tied, we wouldn't have finished.''</p>
        <p>As Woods walked to the 18th green at Firestone Country Club, it was a surreal scene, with the gallery applauding in the dark, photographers' lights providing a strobe effect, and people holding cigarette lighters aloft as if they were attending a rock concert. When it comes to professional golf, everyone sees the light: Woods is the world's best player, by a margin that seems to be growing.</p>
        <p>''I'm a better player than I was last year,'' said Woods, who also won eight times last year, including the P.G.A. Woods has won this year's last three majors -- the United States Open, the British Open and the P.G.A. ''I'm going to try and keep getting better.'' For the opposition, that must be a disturbing thought.</p>
        <p>In reality, this tournament was decided Saturday, when Woods built a nine-stroke lead and left his pursuers to battle for second place. That battle became today's subplot, especially for Price, who probably secured his PGA Tour card for next year by winning $437,000, although a bogey on No. 18 cost him $63,500.</p>
        <p>Woods will fly to California for Monday night's exhibition against Sergio Garcia, a made-for-television event that will be shown live on ABC. Woods would still have made it to California if play had been suspended today, but finishing tonight, instead of playing a few holes Monday, will make the cross-country trip a lot less rushed.</p>
        <p>Hal Sutton, who was paired in the final group with Woods, tried to put early heat on the world's No. 1 player, but it did not last. Sutton birdied three of the first five holes, and when Woods bogeyed No. 6, his lead  over Sutton was down to five strokes.</p>
        <p>The momentum changed, however, with a two-shot swing at No. 8, when Woods birdied and Sutton bogeyed.</p>
        <p>By making his birdie at No. 18, Woods satisfied his caddie, Steve Williams, by finishing 21 under par. Twenty-one is Williams's favorite number.</p>
        <p>''When I got to the last hole, I asked for a new glove, and Steve handed me a glove that he wrote No. 21 on,'' Woods said. ''When my shot landed on the green, I've never seen him that excited. I've won major championships before, and I've never seen him have that kind of reaction.''</p>
        <p>And for Woods, it has been some kind of year. He has already set a tour record with more than $7.69 million in winnings, and he has a realistic chance to become the first player to win $10 million in a season.</p>
        <p>But after Monday, Woods plans to take time off. He has battled the flu for a few days, and after what he has accomplished this year, he could use a rest. His opponents, of course, could use a break as well.</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>There were several great shots Sunday. STEWART CINK, who had the day's low round of 63, made a hole in one on No. 12, using a 4-iron from 213 yards. RETIEF GOOSEN made a hole in one at No. 7, using a 3-iron from 230 yards. Meanwhile, ERNIE ELS made a double-eagle at the par-5, 497-yard No. 2, using a 5-iron from 186 yards on his second shot. Els's ball landed on the green about 10 feet past the pin and rolled slowly back into the cup. . . . TIGER WOODS was two shots short of the PGA Tour's 72-hole scoring record of 257, set by MIKE SOUCHAK in the 1955 Texas Open. . . . JOE BARROW, national director of the First Tee, announced that 129 First Tee facilities are under development nationwide, exceeding the organization's goal of having 100 sites under development by the end of this year. The First Tee's aim is to create affordable places to play golf.</p>
