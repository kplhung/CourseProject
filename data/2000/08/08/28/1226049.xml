        <p>The sight of Mike Hampton sliding on the infield grass and swinging as if he were the cleanup hitter yesterday left Bobby Valentine shaking his head. How could the Mets pitcher risk another injury? But the concern in the visiting dugout at Shea did not set in until Hampton remained on the mound.</p>
        <p>Hampton returned from a stress fracture in his right ribs yesterday and did everything possible to boost the Mets' playoff chances and demoralize the Diamondbacks. His eight dominant innings led the Mets to a 2-1 victory and helped them win this three-game series. They gained a game on the Diamondbacks in the wild-card standing, and many more in their heads.</p>
        <p>''It's like a comfort level to see Mike out there today,'' Mets pitcher Al Leiter said. ''You know if he gets in trouble, he's going to get out of it and that translates into their dugout. They know it's going to be a tough game.''</p>
        <p>As disheartening as it was on Friday for Arizona to see Randy Johnson again look mortal against the Mets, the team had to sense a bigger loss yesterday. The victory put the Mets five and a half games ahead of the Diamondbacks in the National League wild-card race. A sweep this weekend would have written off Arizona. Losing two of three came close. Hampton's return made it worse.</p>
        <p>''The main thing is a sign of relief that he's healthy, or almost healthy,'' John Franco said.</p>
        <p>''If he wasn't 100 percent, I'd hate to see him healthy,'' Arizona Manager Buck Showalter said. ''He was outstanding. He was the difference.''</p>
        <p>Hampton's cracked right rib originated from a high school football injury. But he also strained an oblique muscle on Aug. 17 and missed his last scheduled start. Hampton (13-7) allowed one run on three hits in eight innings yesterday and is 4-0 with a 2.18 earned run average in his past six starts.</p>
        <p>''It's late in the season,'' Hampton said. ''I'm not out there just trying to get through. I'm out there trying to help my team win.''</p>
        <p>Benny Agbayani's solo homer in the fourth inning gave the Mets a 1-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Hampton's only struggle came in the fifth inning, when seven of his first eight pitches were balls. Catcher Mike Piazza thought Hampton was rushing his delivery. Arizona's Kelly Stinnett, who led off with a walk, scored when Danny Bautista lined a two-out single over Edgardo Alfonzo's outstretched glove at second base to tie the score, 1-1.</p>
        <p>Robin Ventura nearly gave the Mets the lead in the bottom of the fifth, but settled for nostalgia. Ventura hit a leadoff drive to straight-away center field, where last October Steve Finley leaped in vain for Todd Pratt's division series-clinching 10th-inning home run. Finley robbed Piazza of an extra-base hit at the wall earlier yesterday, but finally scaled the wall on Ventura. Finley leaped, turned his back toward home plate and reached 3 feet above the wall for the catch.</p>
        <p>''You have to get it out of his reach to be sure,'' Ventura said. ''You just shake your head and go back to the dugout.''</p>
        <p>The Diamondbacks needed this victory and let the starter Armando Reynoso (10-9) pitch the game's decisive moment. Alfonzo and Piazza each had one-out singles in the seventh to put runners on first and second. With a 1-1 count on Ventura, Reynoso tried to pick Alfonzo off second base and nearly did. But he appeared upset when Alfonzo was ruled safe, which replays verified.</p>
        <p>The call either rattled Reynoso or he was extra cautious pitching to Ventura. Three straight balls loaded the bases for Todd Zeile, who hit a slow roller to the hole between shortstop and third. Hanley Frias caught the ball but could only get a forceout at second, allowing the eventual winning run to score.</p>
        <p>That was enough for Hampton. His delivery was unaffected by the injury, which had been the Mets' greatest fear. Athletic trainers said Hampton could do no further damage, basing his ability to pitch on tolerating pain. Hampton admitted he had lingering pain and said he would most likely pitch with some discomfort for the rest of the season.</p>
        <p>''There's a difference between having pain and being hurt,'' Hampton said. ''This is just a pain.''</p>
        <p>Valentine did not stop worrying about Hampton. He cringed when Hampton slid on his knees to field a grounder down the first-base line in the third and appeared displeased when Hampton took a full cut in his first at-bat despite the advice from the pitching coach Dave Wallace, which was, Valentine said: ''Be smart with this thing. Use your head.'' Hampton said the swing was instinctive when he saw a pitch over the plate.</p>
        <p>The rib pain flares mostly when Hampton throws his four-seam fastball, a pitch that can reach 92 miles an hour. Hampton threw only 10 of those yesterday, relying on his lively sinking fastball, changeup and breaking ball.</p>
        <p>Hampton did not, however, buy Valentine's contention that missing one start may have been a blessing in disguise by resting him for the playoff race. Hampton said he has felt strong for months.</p>
        <p>With Hampton out, Jay Bell made a long out to the left-field wall and Jay Payton dropped a line drive for an error in the ninth before Armando Benitez recorded his 35th save. Later, Hampton wore a straight face while answering reporters' question until he was reminded that other pitchers have started in the playoffs with similar injuries.</p>
        <p>''I will too,'' he said with a smile.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Catcher MIKE PIAZZA had a sore neck but was in the lineup after a home-plate collision Saturday with JAY BELL. BOBBY VALENTINE used Piazza because the Mets were off Thursday and he would get a day off against the Astros this week, an indication of the importance of yesterday's game. Valentine did not label Bell's play dirty, although Bell knocked Piazza over with his forearms held high. General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS called it ''excessive.'' Piazza later homered on what seemed to be an unhittable pitch, but the Mets lost by 5-1 in 10 innings. ''If we win that game, 1-0, we'll be talking about that play for two months,'' Valentine said.</p>
