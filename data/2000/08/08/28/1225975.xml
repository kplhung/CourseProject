        <p>IT was a free-market contest of the purest sort, an airwave auction of the kind pioneered in the United States and taken to dizzying new heights in Europe.</p>
        <p>Yet ever since the bidding ended 11 days ago in Germany's auction of wireless licenses for so-called third-generation mobile networks, even devoted market enthusiasts have started to wonder if this is really the most rational way to go.</p>
        <p>After two weeks and 173 rounds of bidding, six companies had bid a total $46 billion for the rights to one license apiece. And that total did not include an additional $4 billion or so that each company would have to spend to build the new networks and drum up customers.</p>
        <p>Investors have been reeling, dumping the stocks of all the winners: Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone AirTouch of Britain, British Telecommunications, France Telecom, Telefonica of Spain and Sonera of Finland.</p>
        <p>Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit-rating agency, warned that it would probably lower most of the companies' credit ratings and might even drop some to the triple-B level, not much better than junk-bond status. Bond investors are bracing for a flood of gigantic telephone bond offerings, but the uncertainties were high enough that British Telecommunications postponed an offering last week until its rating was clarified.</p>
        <p>Certainly, wireless opportunities are immense. Europe is well ahead of the United States in rolling out digital wireless telephones, and the new licenses will be used to offer high-speed data communications that  are eventually expected to galvanize mobile electronic commerce.</p>
        <p>As envisioned, the new third-generation mobile networks will enable people to surf the Internet from a sidewalk, download video clips onto their hand-held phones or simply locate a nearby restaurant and book a table.</p>
        <p>But no one knows what consumers will really want or how much they will be ready to pay. And because the new systems will increase competition in ordinary mobile phone service, analysts predict that prices and profitability in voice service will decline sharply.</p>
        <p>Most economists argue that risks are simply part of the game. If companies overbid, they may have to fold tent and sell their licenses to someone else at a loss. The world will go on.</p>
        <p>But the German auctions also uncovered deep fissures in the European telecommunications landscape that make the entire playing field uneven.</p>
        <p>Britain, Germany and the Netherlands have all held auctions, won by a variety of European players. But Spain and Finland, using a so-called beauty contest approach, simply awarded licenses to companies deemed most worthy. The licenses, granted primarily to domestic applicants, came at a fraction of the price they might have fetched at auction. France will hold a beauty contest, too, but will charge a flat fee of about $4 billion a license.</p>
        <p>Some executives complain that companies from countries with very low license costs can save billions at home and then plow the money into auctions elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''We don't have a level playing field in Europe,'' said Hans Ehnert, a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom. ''We had to compete in the bidding against companies like Telefonica from Spain, but we were excluded from the Spanish market.''</p>
        <p>The idea of auctioning off the airwaves was pioneered in the early 1990's in the United States, where economists and government officials alike viewed them as the fairest and most efficient way of allocating the public airwaves.</p>
        <p>The auction approach developed after governments handed out the first cellular licenses in the 1980's, when companies paid nothing to receive what soon became hugely profitable franchises that grew at explosive rates. By forcing companies to pay the government top dollar, governments and taxpayers would be able to reap at least some  of the bonanza.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the German government's auction windfall is so big that the largess has ignited a major political battle over what to do with the money.</p>
        <p>Advocates of auctions also argue that they are the most effective way to put licenses in the hands of those most likely to  use them profitably. Compared with beauty contests, auctions give the participants no opportunity to exploit political connections or bedazzle government bureaucrats with lofty promises that can later be broken.</p>
        <p>''In a beauty contest, there is no way to ensure that a decision is based on objective facts,'' said Torsten Gerpott, a professor of economics at the University of Duisberg in Germany, who has closely studied the issue.  ''Look at France,'' he said. ''I would bet that at least three of the licenses are awarded to local players.''</p>
        <p>By any measure, both the British and German auctions were open. But one of the surprise winners in the German auction -- a bidder that Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone both tried and failed to eliminate -- was a group controlled by Telefonica of Spain and Sonera of Finland.</p>
        <p>The Spanish and Finnish companies had received new wireless licenses at negligible costs from their own governments.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom bid for a license earlier this year in Spain, where the license fees were relative peanuts: about $130 million and 0.15 percent of future revenues.  Deutsche Telekom teamed up in the beauty contest with Jazztel, a fast-growing Spanish competitor to Telefonica, but the team lost to three Spanish operators and a fourth group led by Vivendi of France.</p>
        <p>As for Finland, Pirjo Kekalainen-Torvinen, Sonera's senior vice president for international business development, said her company had not unfairly benefited by getting a Finnish license almost free. ''We paid as much for our license in Germany as anybody else,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She noted that Finland had strong policy reasons for awarding wireless licenses as cheaply as possible. Finland, which is home  to the world's biggest producer of wireless phones, Nokia, considers wireless technology its biggest national industry. By giving out next-generation wireless licenses as quickly and cheaply as possible, government officials hope to promote and indirectly subsidize innovative new technology and services.</p>
        <p>Many industry executives blame Deutsche Telekom itself for the high prices of the German licenses. Gerhard Schmid, chief executive of Mobilcom, a German company that teamed up with France Telecom and did win a license, angrily complained that the six final bidders could have ended up with the same licenses and saved billions of dollars if they had simply stopped bidding four days earlier.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmid blamed Deutsche Telekom for a misguided attempt to outbid the Spanish-Finnish group for an extra license, a move that would have reduced the number of rivals from six to five.</p>
        <p>But Telefonica and Sonera refused to give up, and Deutsche Telekom exececutives capitulated after the total bidding had climbed from 30 billion euros ($27.1 billion) to 50.5 billion euros. The result was higher license prices and more licensees than most investors had been expecting.</p>
        <p>To be sure, investors pummeled shares of Sonera and Telefonica even more than they did those of Deutsche Telekom. Yet when Italy begins auctions later this year, Deutsche Telekom plans to stay out, saying it has no interest in Italy. But Telefonica and Sonera, exuberant after their German adventure, plan to team up again.</p>
