        <p>Relieved, bitter and still frightened for their companions, five foreign hostages were released by kidnappers in the southern Philippines today for a reported $5 million ransom.</p>
        <p>The releases were a half-step toward ending a strange four-month-long standoff in which the tiny island of Jolo has been flooded with ransom money both for the hostages and for a dozen journalists who have been seized and then released while trying to interview them.</p>
        <p>Four of those freed today were from the original group of 21 people kidnapped on April 23 at a nearby diving resort in Malaysia. The fifth was a French television reporter who had been taken captive when she trekked into the jungle to film them on July 9.</p>
        <p>Seven other Westerners remained hostages on the island, including the last five kidnapped in Malaysia and two other members of the same French television crew. A Filipino worker at the diving resort was also being held, as well as 12 Filipino evangelical Christians who walked into the mountains two months ago to pray with the hostages.</p>
        <p>The kidnappers, a small band of gunmen calling themselves Abu Sayyaf and saying that they are Muslim separatists, had already received $5.5 million in ransom for 11 hostages who were released earlier, the Philippine military said.</p>
        <p>Officially, the government insists that no ransom has been paid. But large amounts of cash are known to have been transferred to the rebels.</p>
        <p>Kidnapping is a cottage industry in the southern Philippines and payoffs -- commonly described as ''room and board'' -- are part of the normal procedure.</p>
        <p>The kidnappers seem to have made a point today of dividing the hostages, releasing a wife but not her husband, a father but not his son and a woman but not her boyfriend. The gunmen are demanding more ransom for the remaining hostages.</p>
        <p>The chief government negotiator, Roberto Aventajado, said he hoped that the other hostages would be freed in the coming days but added, ''There's still a lot of work to be done.''</p>
        <p>An earlier statement from the kidnappers said the partial release today was intended to discourage the government from a military reprisal.</p>
        <p>It said that further releases would depend on additional payments.</p>
        <p>There was little joy among the hostages released today as they arrived by helicopter at the southern Philippine city of Zamboanga. Some were in tears.</p>
        <p>''We feel relieved but we are not happy because there are still people left behind,'' said Marie Moarbes, 33, a French-Lebanese woman. On videotapes taken while in captivity, she had been the strong one, comforting her companions as they trembled at the sound of distant gunfire.</p>
        <p>Still angry, as he had appeared on the videotapes, Werner Wallert, 57, a German, said, ''My son is still there. You don't expect me to be happy.'' An emissary said the father and son had embraced and wept today, each insisting that the other be the one to leave. Mr. Wallert's wife, Renate, had been the first of the hostages to be released, on July 17.</p>
        <p>The others freed today were a French woman, Sonia Wendling, and a South African, Monique Strydom, as well as the television reporter, Maryse Burgot. They were to be flown to Libya, which was the broker for the release. Libya was also reportedly paying the ransom, which officials described as development aid.</p>
        <p>''We Libyans, we know what we are doing,'' said the Libyan ambassador, Saleem Adam, dismissing an accusation that his country was trying to polish its international image by acting as go-between. ''This is a humanitarian mission. It has no other motivation.''</p>
        <p>Six Malaysians from the diving resort were freed earlier. One French man, one South African, one German and two Finns, as well as the Filipino resort worker, are still being held from the kidnapping.</p>
        <p>The negotiations have been difficult and seemingly amateurish, with the Philippine side making sometimes contradictory and counterproductive public statements and the kidnappers squabbling among themselves, changing their demands and backing out of agreements.</p>
        <p>A planned release was canceled two weeks ago when the gunmen said they were afraid they would be attacked and demanded more money.</p>
        <p>There was another cancellation last week after two members of the gang were arrested at a local bank when they tried to convert $240,000 into Philippine pesos. The release proceeded today after the government released the two men, though not their money.</p>
        <p>Much of the earlier ransom money is reported to have been spent on weapons as the Abu Sayyaf band, originally numbering perhaps 200, has vigorously recruited new members to help guard the hostages and secure them against a huge military deployment.</p>
        <p>While negotiators say they have assured the gunmen that they will not be attacked, government officials have predicted strong military action once the last of the hostages is freed.</p>
