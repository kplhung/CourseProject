        <p>KLEZMER!  Jewish Music  From Old World to Our World  By Henry Sapoznik  Illustrated. 340 pages. Schirmer Books. $29.95.</p>
        <p>THE ESSENTIAL KLEZMER  By Seth Rogovoy  Illustrated. 281 pages. Algonquin Books.  $15.95.</p>
        <p>Now that klezmer has become the generic name of a musical style, it is worth noting that from medieval times until a few decades ago the word referred not to a particular variety of music, but to a particular kind of musician. Specifically this evocative conjunction of the Yiddish words ''kley'' (vessel) and ''zemer'' (song) described the instrumentalists whose music enlivened weddings in the shtetls of Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>Klezmer as we know it today is newfangled, having evolved in tandem with other streams of Western music over several hundred years. At its heart is an instrumental imitation of cantorial singing, an emphasis on melodies in minor keys with alternately drooping and ecstatic ornamentation. But its structures borrow from the shtetl's non-Jewish neighbors: many of klezmer's classic forms -- doinas, horas, freylekhs and bulgars -- have Romanian and Ukrainian folk roots.</p>
        <p>One thing that both Henry Sapoznik and Seth Rogovoy show in their very different but complementary studies is that the music now considered authentic, ''pure'' klezmer is just a point on an evolutionary continuum. Because composers did not write down their works, it was not until the first decades of the 20th century, when the nascent record industry identified Jewish immigrants as a niche market, that the sound of klezmer was preserved.</p>
        <p>Those early recordings, though, are as misleading as they are enlightening. They preserve the sound and technique of spectacular players, and they offer an overview of the repertory. But works that thrived on expansive improvisation were squashed into the three or four minutes of a disc side, and musicians were encouraged to play to their audiences' changing tastes. That meant not only touching on nostalgia for the Old World but accounting for New World interests like Yiddish theater songs and jazz.</p>
        <p>This makes for an unruly history, and both Mr. Sapoznik and Mr. Rogovoy cast wide nets to contain it. In the case of Mr. Sapoznik's ''Klezmer! Jewish Music From Old World to Our World,'' the historical discussion regularly veers away from klezmer itself to look at Yiddish theater and its stars, Jewish-American popular recordings and the practice of bringing cantorial music into the concert hall and recording studio. These developments are not irrelevant: Mr. Sapoznik clarifies the degree to which they both drew on and fed into the klezmer mainstream.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogovoy, in ''The Essential Klezmer,'' focuses more fully on recent trends in which traditional klezmer has mingled with jazz, rock and avant-garde experimental music. He is particularly fond of the amalgam now known as Radical Jewish Culture, a catchall appellation invented by the composer John Zorn. If some of this music has only tenuous klezmer links, one can argue, as Mr. Rogovoy does, that its family bonds make it a legitimate part of the story.</p>
        <p>That the evolution from traditional to free-form klezmer took place at all is something of a miracle, because for three decades in the middle of the 20th century klezmer was entirely eclipsed. After World War II the tendency among American Jews -- especially those born here -- was to set aside the remnants of Eastern Europe in favor of an emerging American culture that was driven by film, television and popular music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sapoznik, the son of a cantor, grew up in a Yiddish-speaking household in Brooklyn. Like many in his generation (he is in his mid-40's), he abandoned his parents' culture during his teenage years, having suffered the mortification of having a klezmer band, rather than a rock group, perform at his bar mitzvah celebration. But he was also among the first to return to it, having made a detour as a member of the Delaware Water Gap, a moderately successful folk music band. The story of his return has become klezmer lore: in 1977 Tommy Jarrell, a North Carolina banjo player with whom Mr. Sapoznik was studying, asked him, ''Hank, don't your people have none of their own music?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sapoznik's response was to become an architect of the movement that brought klezmer back into the spotlight. He immersed himself in the archives at YIVO, the New York Yiddish culture research institute. He collected and cataloged countless recordings, photographs and documents, and interviewed musicians. He was a founder of Kapelye, one of the first and most accomplished of the klezmer revival bands, and he produced scores for several documentaries on the music and the culture that produced it.</p>
        <p>He also produced a string of crucial LP and CD reissues, among them collections of recordings by Dave Tarras and Naftule Brandwein, the two greatest klezmer clarinetists of the first half of the 20th century, and the anthologies ''Klezmer Music 1910-1942,'' ''Klezmer Pioneers: European and American Recordings 1905-1952'' and ''Klezmer! Jewish Music From Old World to Our World,'' released as a companion to his book. Mr. Sapoznik's liner notes for these recordings, as well as a 1987 book of musical transcriptions, ''The Compleat Klezmer,'' include a great deal of historical information.</p>
        <p>All this puts Mr. Sapoznik in an odd position as a historian. His research makes him the ideal person to write a history of klezmer, but his active involvement as a performer, composer and record producer brings him too close for objectivity. His book begins as a scholarly history, but at the halfway point it becomes an autobiography, spiced with sharp, amusing opinions but freighted with detail about the internal politics of organizations like YIVO.</p>
        <p>This chattier, more personal section of the book has a certain charm. But a reader looking for a dispassionate history will have the sense of being yanked into a single tree after happily contemplating the forest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogovoy, a music critic in western Massachusetts, began listening to klezmer in 1997 and was so thoroughly seduced by it that he listened to virtually every available recording with klezmer links. His writing about the music's early history lacks the depth and texture of Mr. Sapoznik's work, and it is beset by a tendency to use contemporary pop as an all-purpose yardstick.</p>
        <p>''The Essential Klezmer'' comes to life, though, in the chapters on the bands that have sprouted since the late 1970's. Whereas Mr. Sapoznik's telling is weighted with closely observed detail, Mr. Rogovoy's offers more sweeping, comprehensive surveys of the work of Andy Statman, David Krakauer, the Klezmatics, Brave Old World, the Klezmer Conservatory Band and even Mr. Sapoznik's own band, Kapelye, to say nothing of the post-klezmer renegades led by Mr. Zorn.</p>
        <p>But what makes ''The Essential Klezmer'' invaluable is its second half. An enthusiast's source book, this section includes an extensive critically annotated discography as well as a guide to klezmer Web sites, films, festivals, books and publications.</p>
        <p>Both authors are conscientious about defining the Yiddish and Hebrew terms that pepper their texts.</p>
