        <p>EVENTS</p>
        <p>Hype, 1850 Style  One hundred and fifty years ago this Friday, the most famous performer in Europe arrived in New York to be greeted by some 30,000 fans anticipating her first concert in America. She was Jenny Lind, the Swedish Nightingale, and her fame was attributable in no little part to the promotional efforts of P. T. Barnum, who had mounted her concert tour. When Lind finally sang at the 6,000-seat Castle Garden near Battery Park on Sept. 11, 1850, some 7,000 people were in the audience. From tomorrow through Oct. 29, ''Jenny Lind: The Swedish Nightingale in America,'' an exhibition of memorabilia at the New-York Historical Society, will recall the Lind mania and Barnum's creativity. Information: (212) 873-3400.</p>
        <p>Festive Farewell  Summer at Tanglewood is going out in a burst of jazz. The 2000 season in Lenox, Mass., comes to its end from Friday through Sunday with the annual Jazz Weekend, headlined by Tony Bennett, Dave Brubeck and Diana Krall. The music begins at 7:30 on Friday night with a performance by the Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars, including Jon Faddis, Paquito D'Rivera, Slide Hampton, Kenny Barron, John Lee and Cecil Brooks III. Ms. Krall and Mr. Bennett sing at 7:30 on Saturday night, and the festivities conclude on Sunday with the vocalist Rebecca Parris at 1:30 p.m. and the Dave Brubeck Quartet at 7:30. Information: (413) 637-5165.</p>
        <p>Genius at Work  In 1624, in his role as teacher, Peter Paul Rubens rendered a drawing, ''The Assumption of the Virgin,'' over a sketch by his student Paulus Pontius, who was to become his master engraver. The drawing, executed in black chalk, white gouache and oil paint and notable for its detail, became the basis for an enormous copper-plate engraving. Newly acquired by the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the drawing is the focal point of ''Peter Paul Rubens and the Art of Drawing in Flanders,'' opening at the museum tomorrow and continuing through Oct. 22. Information: (310) 440-7300.</p>

        <p>Cream of the Crop  ''Best of the Fest,'' from Friday through Sunday at the BAM Rose Cinemas at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, draws on the award-winning feature films, documentaries and shorts from the New York Latino Film Festival earlier this year. Illuminating Hispanic talent and the Hispanic experience, the festival begins at 6:50 on Friday night with a screening of Seth Zvi Rosenfeld's ''King of the Jungle,'' the story of a witness to murder pursued by the police, the killer and others. The stars are John Leguizamo, Rosie Perez, Julie Carmen, Annabella Sciorra and Marisa Tomei. A question-and-answer session with the filmmaker follows the screening. Information: (718) 636-4157.</p>
