        <p>''Survivor'' may have posted ratings last week that surpassed everything this year but the Super Bowl, but ''Big Brother,'' the other reality show on CBS, has muddled along with ratings so pale by comparison that the show has had to fight off the impression that it has been a total flop.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, one night after the ''Survivor'' finale soared to a 28.4 rating, ''Big Brother'' scored a 6.3. (Each rating point represents just over one million homes.)</p>
        <p>The network's official position on ''Big Brother,'' which has locked 10 people all summer in a house filled with cameras, is supportive. ''The show is putting up solid summer numbers,'' said Chris Ender, CBS's spokesman for entertainment programs. ''Even its lowest-rated broadcasts are doing far better than what we had in those time periods last year.''</p>
        <p>But unofficially, many senior CBS executives are disappointed with the show's ratings and its execution.</p>
        <p>The show is still pulling in more younger viewers than CBS is accustomed to seeing. But it failed to capitalize on several opportunities to build a steady audience in recent weeks when it followed ''Survivor.'' Now it has to endure six nights a week until Sept. 30 -- many of those nights going against the Olympics on NBC.</p>
        <p>Eddie Michaels, a spokesman for Endemol, the Dutch company that created ''Big Brother,'' said it expected interest to grow as the number of people in the house dwindle in coming weeks. And he said a series of provocative challenges were planned to increase the tension among those who remain.</p>
        <p>Tension has been one factor cited as lacking in the show. Much of the blame has fallen on the casting, the same element for which ''Survivor'' was widely praised. People close to the show say CBS executives contend that Endemol had too much control over casting, while Endemol has said that CBS executives had veto rights over the final selections.</p>
        <p>The biggest shortcoming of ''Big Brother'' may be its inability so far to create anything like the national discussion that ''Survivor'' has generated. In every other country where a version of ''Big Brother'' has played -- including Britain, where the country's version is now an enormous hit -- the show has generated noisy public debate.</p>
        <p>That has not happened with ''Big Brother'' on CBS, where ''Survivor'' has been commanding so much attention.</p>
