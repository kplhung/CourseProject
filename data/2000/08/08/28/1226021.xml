        <p>Steve Finley caught the ball this time, 10 1/2 months too late.

It was a phenomenal catch, the best catch that some observers had ever witnessed. But it was too late.</p>

        <p>Steve Finley caught the ball this time, 10 1/2 months too late. Finley got back to the center-field fence, dug his cleat into the padded blue wall like a mountain climber and then leaped as if he were Michael Jordan wearing gray and purple and going after an alley-oop pass. It was a phenomenal catch, the best catch that some observers had ever witnessed. But it was too late.</p>
        <p>Robin Ventura did not like being robbed. He stopped near second base yesterday, bowed his head and trotted back to the Mets' dugout, exasperated. Finley smiled at Arizona left fielder Luis Gonzalez and stuck out his tongue, playfully. Manager Buck Showalter said, wistfully, that Finley's fifth-inning catch helped the Diamondbacks ''kind of bury some memories.'' But the memories of the final game of last year's division series are still fresh and will not be erased by any play from a 2-1 loss to the Mets in August.</p>
        <p>If Finley had made as incredible a catch 322 days before when Todd Pratt was the batter, who knows how history might have changed for these teams? Could the Diamondbacks have beaten the Atlanta Braves in the National League Championship Series or the Yankees in the World Series? The Mets gained enormous respect for losing to the Braves in six tense games, and they are still the last team Atlanta wants to see lurking in October.</p>
        <p>If Finley's shoulder did not bump into the fence on that other Saturday afternoon at Shea Stadium and if he had been able to time his leap better, everything from last season and perhaps part of this season could have been different. The Diamondbacks were the intriguing upstarts before Finley failed to rob Pratt then, and now the Mets may be bound for the World Series in the season in which Finley pilfered a homer from Ventura. Would all of this still have happened if Finley had caught Pratt's 10th-inning shot to keep the score at 3-3 in Game 4?</p>
        <p>''It would have been a heartbreak for us,'' Bobby Valentine admitted. ''It's one of those situations where you never know. It might have been pretty big for them. It probably would have been.''</p>
        <p>Showalter has not changed. He still speaks in rambling tones, he still had an ''Andy Griffith Show'' compact disc on his desk and he was still reluctant to say that something from the past pained him. So that was why Showalter recalled one of the more frustrating games of his career and said: ''Just because he catches the ball doesn't mean we win that game. That's why I don't think about it much.''</p>
        <p>It was impossible not to draw the parallel between the play Finley missed in October and the play he made in August. Finley actually made two excellent plays yesterday, because he also ran into the fence to steal a double from Mike Piazza in the second inning, a play that was much more similar to Pratt's ball because it was a liner. Finley admitted that he thought about Pratt's homer soon after he extended his glove 3 feet above the 8-foot-high fence to swipe Ventura's 415-foot shot out of the air. But Finley also claimed he did not think about the homer he missed in the off-season. That is difficult to believe.</p>
        <p>''If I catch that ball, it's a tie ballgame still,'' Finley said. ''Who knows what's going to happen?''</p>
        <p>That is precisely the point. Who knows? At least it would have prolonged the Diamondbacks' season. Instead, their season ended when Pratt's homer went over Finley's glove. The Diamondbacks won 100 games in their second season and expectations increased. Now the Diamondbacks are five and a half games behind the Mets for the wild-card berth and they should focus on trying to win the National League West, where they trail the Giants by two and a half games. Shockingly, Showalter is fielding daily questions about his job status.</p>
        <p>''I'm fine with it,'' said Showalter, who is probably not.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Valentine, who had to meet with his team before Game 3 of the division series to discuss how he said in a Sports Illustrated article that there were five losers in the clubhouse, has mostly been devoid of controversies this season. His team has risen in the standing, and his stock as a possible free-agent manager has increased.</p>
        <p>Valentine looked up from his computer yesterday when he was reminded about how the fortunes of the two teams and the two managers have changed so dramatically. He is in a sturdier position than Showalter.</p>
        <p>''That could have been me if we had lost two of three to the Diamondbacks,'' Valentine said. ''That might have started up.''</p>
        <p>Apparently, Valentine was joking. But maybe not. A healthy Mike Hampton pitched eight three-hit innings yesterday and is part of a solid rotation. The Mets also have a deep, talented bullpen and an everyday lineup that is superior to the Yankees' at every position except shortstop, center field and right field.</p>
        <p>Ten and a half months after Pratt's homer, the Mets are still better than the Diamondbacks, and they are still chasing the Braves and the Yankees. But this season the Mets look as if they could outlast their National League nemesis and their New York nemesis. The same magic is not expected from the Diamondbacks, whose best chance may have disappeared over the center-field fence at Shea last October.</p>
        <p>''I would trade every catch I've ever made,'' Finley said, ''for that one.''</p>
