        <p>Sir Lynden O. Pindling, the prime minister of the Bahamas for 25 years whose reputation and relationship with the United States were marred by unresolved accusations of protecting drug traffickers, died on Saturday at his home in Nassau. He was 70.</p>
        <p>The cause was prostate cancer, aides said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Sir Lynden was the prime minister from 1967 to 1992, leading the Bahamas through tremendous change, including the transition from a British colony to independence in 1973. He was defeated in the 1992 election by the current prime minister, Hubert Ingraham. At the time of his defeat, Sir Lynden had been in office longer than any leader in the Western Hemisphere except Fidel Castro of Cuba.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, as radio and television stations in the Bahamas broadcast tributes to Sir Lynden, Mr. Ingraham called him ''a giant of our times,'' according to The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>Left unmentioned, however, were allegations involving Sir Lynden in the 1980's that political observers in the Bahamas say contributed to his defeat. He was accused of covering up for drug traffickers and of taking bribes as the chairman of the nation's Hotel Commission. A Bahamian government commission was unable to substantiate any of the claims, but the allegations had pronounced political ramifications.</p>
        <p>Sir Lynden remained a member of the House of Assembly until 1997, when he resigned after 41 years in that legislative body. At the time, he said he was ''less than perfect,'' but added that ''when all I did for good is put in the balance against all I did for ill or failed to do at all, I hope that future generations will not find me sorely wanting.''</p>
        <p>In 1953, he helped found the Progressive Liberal Party, a political organization dedicated to overthrowing the mostly white colonial-run United Bahamian Party. Some supporters called him the ''black Moses.''</p>
        <p>When he was first elected prime minister in 1967, he ended a tradition of white minority rule that had been in place for centuries. He devoted his first term in office to securing independence from Britain and used that prestige to win five more elections.</p>
        <p>Sir Lynden spent much of his time working to improve the reputation of his country, but became vulnerable to charges of corruption in 1984, when an official commission set up to investigate drug trafficking in the Bahamas found wide evidence of official corruption in his cabinet and the Bahamian police. The commission eventually cleared Sir Lynden of any wrongdoing, but said that he and his wife had at least $3.5 million in bank deposits that could not be accounted for.</p>
        <p>At the 1987 trial of Carlos Lehder, a founder of the Medellin cocaine cartel in Colombia, prosecutors charged that Mr. Lehder and other drug traffickers had paid at least $5 million to Sir Lynden for permission to use the Bahamas as a shipment point for cocaine and marijuana bound for the United States.</p>
        <p>Several drug smugglers testified that they had made such payments directly to him. The prime minister denied the accusations. After Mr. Lehder's conviction, the United States sought to confiscate his holdings in the Bahamas, but was rebuffed by Sir Lynden. He continued to quarrel with the United States until his 1992 defeat.</p>
        <p>By that year, though, a decline in the economy in the late 1980's and early 1990's had become the decisive factor for many voters. Tourism was by far the largest source of employment and revenue in the nation of more than 700 islands, and the Bahamas was finding it difficult to compete with other vacation destinations.</p>
        <p>To many young voters, Sir Lynden was seen not as a father of their country, but as an international pariah and leader who could not get them jobs.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Lady Marguerite; two sons, Obafemi, 40, and Leslie, 39; two daughters, Michelle Sands, 38, and Monique Johnson, 34; and five grandchildren.</p>
