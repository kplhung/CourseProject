        <p>Flash floods along Route 22 and other roads in Somerset County, N.J., stranded at least nine motorists last night, some of whom had to wait on the roofs of their cars in a downpour for firefighters to rescue them, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>More than four inches of rain fell in a couple of hours in the area around Green Brook and North Plainfield, said Bill Christ, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. As a result, waters rose higher than the divider along several stretches of Route 22, one of the main east-west corridors in central New Jersey, said Peter Sylvester, Green Brook's acting fire chief.</p>

        <p>Flash floods along Route 22 and other roads in Somerset County, N.J., stranded at least nine motorists last night, some of whom had to wait on the roofs of their cars in a downpour for firefighters to rescue them, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>More than four inches of rain fell in a couple of hours in the area around Green Brook and North Plainfield, said Bill Christ, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. As a result, waters rose higher than the divider along several stretches of Route 22, one of the main east-west corridors in central New Jersey, said Peter Sylvester, Green Brook's acting fire chief.</p>
        <p>''We had rainfall I would estimate about an inch every 10 minutes for close to half an hour,'' the chief said.</p>
        <p>Several motorists, fearful of being swept away by the fast-moving waters or drowning in their cars, perched on their roofs, Chief Sylvester said. Firefighters and police officers waded out onto the roadway with ropes tied to high ground and led 9 to 12 people to safety, he said.</p>
        <p>Parts of Route 22 were closed for several hours by the flooding, and many cars were damaged beyond repair, the chief added.</p>
