        <p>Thousands of copies of a new book by a former official White House photographer were confiscated by Chinese customs officials as the books were being prepared for shipment from a bindery in southern China, effectively blocking its release in the United States.</p>
        <p>The publisher and printer said the book, ''The Clinton Years,'' was seized because among its 227 black-and-white photographs was a picture of President Clinton clasping hands and chatting at the White House with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism. The Chinese government opposes the Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile since China's invasion of Tibet in 1959, because he remains a symbol of cultural and political separatism to his Tibetan followers.</p>
        <p>The decision to block the book's shipment startled publishers and printers in the United States who have come to rely on Hong Kong and southern China as a center for making illustrated books.</p>
        <p>The seizure also stands in contrast to the image that the Chinese government is striving to present to the American public, as the Senate prepares to take up a bill this fall to normalize trade relations with China. In an effort to smooth the legislation's passage, China's State Council Information Office and its Ministry of Culture are spending $7 million on an elaborate exhibition of Chinese culture that is touring cities across the United States.</p>
        <p>''This is a very stupid time to do this,'' said Patricia Schroeder, president of the American Association of Publishers and a former member of Congress. ''To exercise political censorship, dealing with freedom of religion, over a book about the president of the United States -- that is just not very wise right now.''</p>
        <p>A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The printing was arranged by Palace Press International, an American company in San Francisco, Calif., which acts as a broker between publishers and printing companies in Asia. Gordon Goff, the director of Palace Press, which hires printers in China for about 500 titles each year on behalf of about 300 publishers, said he was stunned when he learned of the book's seizure last week.</p>
        <p>The book is an album of photographs taken by Robert McNeely while he was Mr. Clinton's official photographer from 1992 to 1998. President and Mrs. Clinton approved the use of the photographs, but they have no financial stake in the book.</p>
        <p>The publisher is Callaway Editions in New York. The first batch of 8,000 copies of the book had already been bound and shipped to the United States at the beginning of August. But about three weeks ago the Chinese officials seized the next 16,000 copies, which had been printed in Hong Kong and sent to Schenzen for binding.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goff said that about two weeks ago Chinese officials also impounded the entire 10,000-copy first printing of another book, ''Celestial Gallery,'' a collection of colorful Tibetan Buddhist art which Palace Press was also handling for Callaway Editions. Mr. Goff said Palace Press was appealing to officials in Beijing, in hopes of having the books released.</p>
        <p>Printers and publishers including Mr. Goff, the printing giant R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons, the art book publisher Harry N. Abrams, and others said that they had not previously heard of Chinese customs officials blocking shipment of books for religious or political reasons. Last year, for example, Palace Press successfully shipped from China 10,000 copies of ''The Dalai Lama,'' a daily meditation and prayer guide published by a small American publisher.</p>
        <p>Zhang Yuanyuan, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said after consulting with Chinese cultural officials who are visiting the United States, that China maintained a consistent ban on the production of printed material deemed to be politically sensitive, like depictions of the Dalai Lama, even in books intended for export.</p>
        <p>''It is the consistent policy of the government to actually control the political content of printed materials,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''Such books were never allowed to be printed on Chinese soil, and, if in the past they were not intercepted at the border, it was just a coincidence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McNeely took the photograph that has offended the Chinese on April 28, 1994, as the Dalai Lama held Mr. Clinton's hand during a meeting at the White House. An introduction by the historian Douglas Brinkley notes that Mr. Clinton met with the Dalai Lama in the vice president's office that day instead of the Oval Office out of deference to the Chinese government.</p>
        <p>In another picture, the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, signed a gift book for President Clinton, who looked on without enthusiasm. The book was a history of Tibet. The Chinese president had just told President Clinton ''that when he finished reading it he would understand why Tibet is and always has been a part of China,'' Mr. McNeely recalled.</p>
        <p>The confiscation of ''The Clinton Years'' and ''Celestial Gallery'' comes at a crucial time for Callaway Editions. Until recently, Callaway had been a book packager -- conceiving ideas for illustrated books, hiring artists and writers and selling the finished products to other publishers.</p>
        <p>But for this fall, Callaway is publishing its own books for the first time. Mr. McNeely's photographic study of the Clinton administration, planned for release in September, was to be Callaway's most heavily promoted book of the season. But the delay of shipment by Chinese officials could push the release past the fall season and even until after Mr. Clinton is out of office.</p>
        <p>''We're in a difficult position right now,'' said Nicholas Callaway, the company's founder. Still, he noted, the Chinese censorship may have backfired. ''What the officials don't realize is they are going to immortalize these books,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Because making illustrated books is complicated and expensive, American book publishers have long sent much of their illustrated book production overseas, where labor is cheaper. Printers in Hong Kong and southern China, in particular, have  earned a reputation for high-quality production and low-cost labor.</p>
        <p>Manufacturing an oversized book like ''Celestial Gallery,'' for example, which entails polychromatic images and a hand binding, costs about $20 a copy to produce in China, compared with about $50 a copy in the United States.</p>
        <p>Told of the books' seizure, critics of freer trade with China were quick to note the irony of a book about a staunch free-trader like President Clinton running afoul of China's censors. ''The concept of free trade is compromised when you are dealing with a government that is unwilling to respect individual rights like freedom of expression,'' said Mickey Spiegel, a research consultant with the nonprofit organization Human Rights Watch. ''In this case, free trade puts the Chinese government in the position of being able to censor what Americans read.''</p>
