        <p>''The era of smart, connected devices is just beginning,'' said Tom St. Dennis, the president and chief executive of Wind River.  ''Already millions and every soon billions of devices will be connected to the Internet.</p>
        <p>ICEsoft, based in Bergen, Norway, developed a highly popular Web browser for devices with limited computing power called ICE Browser. The program is written in Java, the software standard developed by Sun Microsystems, and supports XML, a type of software coding that will allow for the seamless interchange of all sorts of dynamic data across different computer programs. ICEsoft will continue to operate in Bergen. Wind River has 15 other offices in Europe.</p>
