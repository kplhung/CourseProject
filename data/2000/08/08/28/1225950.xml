        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Whether to Kill Those Who Killed as Youths'' (front page, Aug. 22): As a psychologist who worked extensively with delinquents for many years, I witnessed the cumulative effects of both overt abuse and covert abuse or neglect.</p>
        <p>Most of the youths I treated lacked both trust and empathy, had limited problem-solving skills and lacked internal resources upon which to draw at times of crisis. While their acts of violence are typically viewed as acts against others, I have come to learn that these acts reflect more accurately their hostility toward rejected aspects of themselves.</p>
        <p>Executing these individuals represents the re-enactment of their experiences in childhood of again being damaged by those who should have been there to protect them. The solution is not execution, but further study and development of more effective identification and treatment programs before these tragedies occur.</p>
        <p>THOMAS F. KENNEDY  Goshen, N.Y., Aug. 23, 2000</p>
