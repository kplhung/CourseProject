        <p>They talked about situations like this in their meeting Friday -- doing what it takes to win games in the late innings. The Yankees trailed Oakland by two runs in the eighth inning today when center fielder Terrence Long lost a fly ball in California's sun, and Derek Jeter said it was a ''no-doubter'' -- the Yankees were sure they were going to come back.</p>
        <p>This is their time. Summer is surrendering to fall and on their 25-man roster, the Yankees' players have the cumulative experience of 54 World Series. They know how to react under duress and recover, as they did in a 7-5 victory over Oakland. ''The door is open, and you explode right through it,'' Jeter said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees finally prevailed in their staredown with Boston: The Yankees and Red Sox had matched victory for victory and loss for loss over the last eight days, and the Yankees' advantage in the American League East held at three games.</p>
        <p>But when the Yankees began their game here this afternoon, they could all see on the scoreboard in left field that the Red Sox were deep into an 11-7 loss at Kansas City. The Yankees had an opportunity to push their lead to four games.</p>
        <p>Denny Neagle floundered through the first inning, again, allowing a hit and a walk and then a three-run homer to Mike Stanley, and Sal Fasano ripped another homer in the second to give Oakland a 4-0 lead. The Yankees were in jeopardy of losing for the second time in the three-game series. All the talk in Friday's meeting would seem like nothing more than talk if they couldn't come back.</p>
        <p>Neagle (4-4) limited the Athletics to one run over the next five innings; the Yankees scored a run in the third and two in the fourth. Jim Mecir relieved Gil Heredia in the seventh, assuming a 5-3 edge, and the pinch-hitter Glenallen Hill battled him through a 10-pitch at-bat before striking out. Jeter whiffed on five pitches, and although the Yankees hadn't scored, they had pushed Mecir -- accustomed to throwing about 20 pitches per outing -- to expend 15 pitches.</p>
        <p>As the Yankees prepared to bat in the eighth, Roger Clemens chatted with Jose Canseco, discussing what Mecir might try to throw; as Canseco walked to the on-deck circle, Clemens drew two hands together in a clap and encouraged Canseco. Bernie Williams, limited to batting right-handed because of a strained rib cage, waited on the bench, in case he was needed as a pinch-hitter.</p>
        <p>David Justice walked to lead off, and Canseco turned on an inside fastball and smashed a single to left; first and second, nobody out. Jose Vizcaino ran for Canseco. The Athletics' fans here murmured.</p>
        <p>Tino Martinez lifted a high fly to center field, harmless except that as Long stared into the sky through his sunglasses -- without using his glove as a shield -- the sun was eclipsing the ball. At the last second, the rookie reached unsteadily, lowering his glove to his waist to attempt a basket catch.</p>
        <p>The ball hit his glove, fell, and Justice and Vizcaino scrambled to reach third and second, respectively. Bases loaded, nobody out.</p>
        <p>Mecir struck out Jorge Posada, and Luis Sojo fell behind, no balls and two strikes. ''All I wanted to do in that situation,'' Sojo said, ''was just put my bat on the ball.''</p>
        <p>Sojo reached and swung and chopped a grounder toward third, looked up and glanced at third baseman Eric Chavez, and was surprised to see how deep Chavez was playing. Chavez moved in to field the ball, and Sojo chugged down the line.</p>
        <p>Then Sojo saw Stanley, the first baseman, lurching off the bag: Chavez's throw was so high and wide that the first base coach Lee Mazzilli dived chest-first to the ground, and the ball bounded into the Coliseum's huge foul territory. Justice scored, Vizcaino scored, tie game. Runners at second and third. The Yankees were yelling and high-fiving on their bench.</p>
        <p>Scott Brosius was stepping to the plate, Clay Bellinger was on deck, and Manager Joe Torre told Williams that if Brosius was walked, then Williams would pinch-hit for Bellinger.</p>
        <p>But Williams, who hadn't batted left-handed since Aug. 18 because of his strained rib cage, told Torre he wanted to bat left-handed against Mecir. Torre and the trainer, Gene Monahan, tried persuading Williams to bat right-handed against the right-handed Mecir, to protect his injury.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't going to bat right-handed,'' Williams said afterward.</p>
        <p>Manager and player debated a bit. Mecir, who had now thrown more than 40 pitches, walked Brosius intentionally, filling the bases. Williams wanted to bat left-handed. Monahan and Torre consulted quickly and agreed.</p>
        <p>Mecir fell behind, two balls and no strikes, and then Williams slapped a grounder to the left side. Martinez raced home as the Athletics tried to turn a double play, but Williams beat the relay to first.</p>
        <p>On a day when right fielder Paul O'Neill was unavailable because of his hip pointer, Torre had used two pinch-hitters and a pinch-runner trying to come back from the early deficit, forcing him to restructure his defense for the eighth. Brosius moved to left field, Sojo shifted from second to third, and Vizcaino stepped in to play second base -- and because Vizcaino had been used a pinch-runner for the designated hitter, Canseco, the Yankees had to sacrifice the D.H. to do this.</p>
        <p>When Dwight Gooden came on to pitch the eighth, he was slotted into the leadoff spot. But his place in the batting order wasn't as unusual as the simple fact that Gooden was called upon to protect a one-run lead in the eighth, a job usually assigned to the right-hander Jeff Nelson or the left-hander Mike Stanton.</p>
        <p>He got two outs, and Mariano Rivera took over from there, getting the last four outs, and soon the Yankees were on their way to Seattle, their lead over the Red Sox at four games.</p>
        <p>''This could be a very big win for us,'' Torre said. ''A lot depends on what we do the rest of the road trip, but this could mean a lot to us. It was a big game, because we kept going at people.''</p>
