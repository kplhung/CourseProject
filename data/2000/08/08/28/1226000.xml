        <p>The celebration echoed through the Compaq Center and filtered hauntingly into the loser's locker room. As though being beaten for the third time by the Houston Comets in the Women's National Basketball Association finals wasn't enough, the Liberty couldn't shut out the sounds of its failure.</p>
        <p>The Comets' 79-73 overtime victory Saturday was as traumatic as it was dramatic for the Liberty. Despite the odds against winning twice on Houston's court, the Liberty players said they truly believed they could bring down this dynasty.</p>
        <p>''We played them better than anybody else played them this season,'' guard Becky Hammon said. ''We came in here with a lot of heart and determination, and fell one basket short again. It's not a very good feeling.''</p>
        <p>Center Tari Phillips said, ''I thought if we were able to pull this one out, we would have won the series.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the Liberty became a footnote to a fourth title.</p>
        <p>The Comets' four straight W.N.B.A. championships are the most consecutive titles in professional sports since the Islanders won four National Hockey League Stanley Cups from 1980 to 1983.</p>
        <p>The last such run in baseball was put together by the Yankees, who won five titles from 1949 to 1953. In the National Basketball Association, the Boston Celtics won eight straight titles, from 1959 to 1966. There has never been a National Football League team that won four straight championships, although the Green Bay Packers won three straight, in the seasons from 1965 to 1967.</p>
        <p>In hindsight, the Liberty can make a valid argument that it could have swept the two-of-three-game series from the Comets, who are scheduled for a victory parade Tuesday in downtown Houston thanks to Cynthia Cooper's two clutch baskets.</p>
        <p>In Game 1 at Madison Square Garden, Cooper's 3-point play with 26 seconds left clinched the Comets' 59-52 victory. If her shot with 21.5 seconds to play from beyond the N.B.A. 3-point line had missed and Game 2 had not gone into overtime, the Liberty most likely would have won and tied the series.</p>
        <p>Much like its regular season, which started 4-9, the Liberty found success to be elusive and victories hard earned in the playoffs. The Liberty blew several chances to beat the Comets, but it also staged impressive comebacks, particularly in Game 2, when it rallied from 10 points down in the first half and from 9 points down in the second half.</p>
        <p>''We knew we had a lot of talented players, we just had to find that chemistry,'' the Liberty's Vickie Johnson said. ''In the second half of the season, we really put it together. Everybody doubted us and never thought we would win the East. But we always fought back.''</p>
        <p>Now the Liberty and the rest of the W.N.B.A. can look forward to a league without Cooper, the four-time finals most valuable player whose retirement casts a shadow on the Comets' quest for a fifth straight championship.</p>
        <p>''If you look at all the games she has won for them, they would have to do a lot of adjusting and a lot of regrouping,'' Liberty Coach Rich Adubato said. ''Nobody has the ability to break the defense down and finish the way she does. Swoopes breaks it down and scores. Cooper breaks it down and creates opportunities for everybody.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty's Sue Wicks said, ''When she leaves, it will be a different game.''</p>
        <p>Even Sheryl Swoopes, the league's most valuable player and defensive player of the year, admits to wondering about the post-Cooper era. But she predicts several stars-in-waiting will emerge to keep the Comets among the W.N.B.A.'s elite next season.</p>
        <p>''I'd be foolish to say we're not going to miss Cynthia,'' Swoopes said. ''She's been such a great player. We're going to miss her, and the basketball world is going to miss her. At the same time, I don't want to take anything away from this team and say we're going to be nothing without her. Obviously, we're going to be different offensively, but other players will have their chance to shine. We'll be ready for that challenge.''</p>
        <p>Swoopes, who scored 31 points on Saturday, added: ''I'm never going to think this is my team, this is the way we're going to do it, etc. This is our team. That's why we've been so successful.''</p>
        <p>Especially against the Liberty.</p>
