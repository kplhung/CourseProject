        <p>As far as neighbors could tell, Dr. I. Kathleen Hagen was not just an accomplished Harvard-educated doctor but a devoted daughter who left her home in the Virgin Islands and returned to care for her ailing parents in their modest home in Chatham Township, N.J.</p>
        <p>Even when Dr. Hagen, 54, was living on the island of St. Thomas, the couple's neighbors said, she visited her parents frequently, working in the garden with her father and, when Tropical Storm Floyd hit, helping pump water out of the sloping driveway next to her parents' home, a three-bedroom 1950's ranch home surrounded by more stately houses.</p>

        <p>As far as neighbors could tell, Dr. I. Kathleen Hagen was not just an accomplished Harvard-educated doctor but a devoted daughter who left her home in the Virgin Islands and returned to care for her ailing parents in their modest home in Chatham Township, N.J.</p>
        <p>Even when Dr. Hagen, 54, was living on the island of St. Thomas, the couple's neighbors said, she visited her parents frequently, working in the garden with her father and, when Tropical Storm Floyd hit, helping pump water out of the sloping driveway next to her parents' home, a three-bedroom 1950's ranch home surrounded by more stately houses.</p>
        <p>Now, neighbors, the police and prosecutors are struggling to piece together the chain of events that led to Dr. Hagen's being charged this weekend with the murder of her parents, Idella F. Hagen, 92, and James Hagen, 86.</p>
        <p>At 6:45 a.m. Saturday, Dr. Hagen telephoned the police to say that her parents were dead, said Capt. Christopher D. Linne, a spokesman for the Morris County prosecutor's office. Captain Linne said ''there were additional conversations'' between Dr. Hagen and the police, but he would not say whether she had confessed.</p>
        <p>When the police arrived at the Hagen home, at 614 Fairmont Avenue, they found Mr. and Mrs. Hagen in their nightclothes in twin beds in the master bedroom, Captain Linne said. The Morris County medical examiner determined that they had been asphyxiated, he said.</p>
        <p>The couple had been dead for three to seven days when their bodies were discovered, officials at the prosecutor's office said.</p>
        <p>When the police arrived, Dr. Hagen was wearing a nightgown that appeared to have been worn for several days, said the Morris County prosecutor, John B. Dangler. ''She appeared to be very distraught,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hagen's bail has been set at $2.5 million, and she is scheduled to appear before a Morris County Superior Court judge either today or tomorrow, Mr. Dangler said. Even though Dr. Hagen has ''a sizable amount of personal wealth,'' Mr. Dangler said, she has not moved to post her own bail and she remains in the Morris County jail.</p>
        <p>Investigators have not determined a motive for the killing, the authorities said. But for Dr. Hagen, the arrest is the latest twist in an unconventional life in which she left an apparently successful career in urology to manage a small island inn.</p>
        <p>Records indicate that Idella Kathleen Hagen graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1973. She was an intern and a surgery resident at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston until 1975, when she became the first woman to be appointed a urology resident there. By 1979, Dr. Hagen was a fellow at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.</p>
        <p>According to The Daily Record of Morris County, Dr. Hagen was appointed chief of the urology division at Rutgers Medical School in 1982 and was chief urologist at Rutgers's main teaching hospital, Middlesex General in New Brunswick. The hospital is now called the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, and the medical school is Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.</p>
        <p>While officials said that Dr. Hagen's medical license was valid until next year, she seemed to have dropped her medical career in the late 1980's, when she moved to the island of St. Thomas with her husband at the time, William Tyrrell of Stuart, Fla.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyrrell did not return several telephone calls to his home yesterday. The prosecutor's office said that Dr. Hagen had been married and divorced twice.</p>
        <p>From about 1987 until 1992, Dr. Hagen and Mr. Tyrrell lived on St. Thomas, where they operated the West Indies Inn, said their landlord, Richard Doumeng, the general manager of the Bolongo Bay Beach Club. They left that business after a series of storms ravaged the building and hurt tourism, he said.</p>
        <p>''They had put so much of their blood, sweat and tears into the place, and then it got severely damaged,'' Mr. Doumeng said. ''They just didn't have the energy to do it again.'' Mr. Doumeng said the inn was Mr. Tyrrell's dream more than his wife's. ''Their time here took a toll on them as a couple.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hagen had been living with her parents since last month, the authorities said. ''She was in between careers and was torn between staying with her parents and going back down to the Virgin Islands,'' said Scott Tucker, 48, a neighbor.</p>
        <p>''We had no idea what she was going through,'' said Mr. Tucker's wife, Laura. ''It must have been something awful.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 30, 2000, Wednesday  An article on Monday about charges that Dr. I. Kathleen Hagen murdered her parents, Idella and James Hagen, at their home in Chatham Township, N.J., misspelled the street where they lived. It is Fairmount Avenue, not Fairmont.</p>
