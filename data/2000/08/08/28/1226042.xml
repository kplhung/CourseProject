        <p>Just five years ago, this small city on the Hudson River was literally broke.</p>
        <p>It had racked up millions of dollars of debts, but had scarcely enough money in the bank to cover a week's bills.

        <p>Just five years ago, this small city on the Hudson River was literally broke.</p>
        <p>It had racked up millions of dollars of debts, but had scarcely enough money in the bank to cover a week's bills. It could put only two police cars out on the streets to patrol a city of 51,000 people. And city officials were scrambling to sell anything they could lay their hands on, up to and including City Hall, which at one point bore a sign reading ''For Sale by Owner.''</p>
        <p>But times have changed for the better in Troy -- and how. The city's budget was balanced last year, for the fourth year in a row. There is finally enough money for improvements, like new police stations and fire trucks. The city's extraordinary downtown -- it looks like New York City might have in the 1870's -- has been repaved and replanted. New businesses, once scared off by the threat of municipal bankruptcy, have started moving in.</p>
        <p>And perhaps most important to the people of Troy, their city is no longer a local disgrace or a national laughingstock, as it was in the mid-1990's. ''Now people look over here and say, 'That place is doing all right,' '' said William F. Fagan, an insurance agent and head of the local industrial development authority.</p>
        <p>How that turnaround came to be is a tale of local grit, of citizens who would not give up on their city and a new mayor who was brave enough to raise taxes and make hard choices. But Troy also got a huge amount of help from the state, which in the last four years has pumped about $20 million of direct aid into the city and spent millions more on economic development projects.</p>
        <p>So Troy has been relying on the kindness of friends, like its state senator, Joseph L. Bruno, who happens to be the powerful Senate majority leader. And in an odd way, it is relying on the kindness of strangers: the taxpayers down in the booming southern tip of New York who have helped fill the state's coffers so that there is money available for Troy.</p>
        <p>Troy is not alone. Almost every small city in the state, from Newburgh to Niagara Falls, has faced some of the same pressures Troy has: loss of manufacturing jobs, loss of population and loss of property values, which means loss of tax revenues. A handful, including Utica, mismanaged themselves into a similar municipal mess.</p>
        <p>And though their rebounds may not be as sharp as Troy's, many cities have clearly been helped by an improving economy upstate and assistance from the state.</p>
        <p>But they remain dependent, fiscally and economically, on the financial success of once-scorned New York City, said Helen Cregger, a vice president of Moody's Investors Service, which evaluates the creditworthiness of local governments. ''Without those training wheels, they're not ready to do it alone,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The paradox that has New York City and its environs, long reviled upstate, helping to subsidize the urban north, is not lost on H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller. ''This is one state -- everyone's in this together,'' he said, adding that the Legislature could help by making state aid for cities predictable.</p>
        <p>Each city in New York has its own story, and Troy's is a long one. Situated on the east bank of the Hudson River, north of Albany, Troy was a center of transportation, especially after the Erie Canal opened in 1825.</p>
        <p>And it was an industrial center before and after the Civil War; the Chamber of Commerce boasts that practically every horseshoe for the Union Army was made in Troy. Later, it became known as Collar City, as more than 10,000 people sewed detachable collars and cuffs for men's shirts.</p>
        <p>In its heyday, city fathers say, Troy was the 11th largest city in the country, and the fourth richest.</p>
        <p>Even after motorcars and washing machines put the kibosh on the horseshoe and collar businesses, Troy usually managed to hold its own, despite some tough times in this century. It has two colleges -- Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Russell Sage College for Women -- that boomed after World War II, and it is close to all the state jobs in Albany.</p>
        <p>And well into the 1970's, local residents say, Troy remained a shopping mecca. Young couples might buy their wedding rings at a jeweler near Monument Square, then go up River Street to Nellick's to buy their furniture, just as their parents and grandparents did. But eventually, malls mushroomed and the suburbs beckoned, and the quaint downtown grew empty and abandoned.</p>
        <p>As for city government, the big trouble began in 1991, when the state economy was in a recession and New York State drastically cut aid to cities; Troy's fell by almost one third. Meanwhile, its own revenues dropped while its expenses jumped, according to a scathing 1995 report by the independent Center for Governmental Research in Rochester.</p>
        <p>But while some cities coped with similar problems, Troy -- where bare-knuckle politics are a blood sport -- did not. ''Everyone can share in the blame,'' said Senator Bruno, a Republican. ''We were fighting more for turf than for the best interests'' of the community.</p>
        <p>Even as the city government's financial health worsened, the Democratic City Council, which governed through a city manager, was reluctant to face financial reality and raise taxes or cut expenses. Instead, it turned to accounting gimmicks, like a complex bond issue that basically mortgaged City Hall.</p>
        <p>The 1992 bond issue, which Mr. McCall later criticized as improper and bad for taxpayers, raised money to cover the deficit and finance some grandiose building projects, like a recreation center the city has never been able to afford to operate. It also saddled Troy with enormous interest payments that ate up more than 20 percent of its budget.</p>
        <p>By 1995, the city was more than $50 million in debt; it couldn't borrow any more. A new City Council, led this time by Republicans, has fired 50 city employees, but it wasn't enough. Thus, the ''For Sale'' sign on City Hall, a structure much larger than the city needed, and talk of selling the city's water system or filing for bankruptcy protection.</p>
        <p>The mood around town was dismal, said William Patrick Madden, who runs a nonprofit housing program in the city and whose family has been there for generations. The municipal mess ''just broke people's spirits,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It didn't help that times were hard in other ways; in the mid-1990's, he added, his staff spent half its time counseling people who were about to default on their financial obligations. (Today, that takes up just 3 percent of their time.)</p>
        <p>At this point, in 1995, Mark P. Pattison was elected mayor, the first in 30 years. A rumpled and outspoken Democrat whose family settled in Troy back in canal days, Mr. Pattison had run group homes for the mentally handicapped before he became a mayoral candidate.</p>
        <p>''I may be the only politician who found that things were exactly as bad as he said they were,'' Mr. Pattison now says, with regret. Every day seemed to bring some new financial calamity, like the discovery that although the city had more than 100 police officers, there were only enough working police cars to put two on the street at a time.</p>
        <p>He recalled that he immediately raised property taxes by 21 percent and water charges by 38 percent, as 200 protesters picketed City Hall.</p>
        <p>He also negotiated with bondholders to cut the city's debt, and embraced a state-imposed supervisory board that had veto power over the city's financial decisions. In return, a municipal assistance corporation, like the one that bailed out New York City in the 1970's, helped Troy raise money. Last year, the city regained control of its finances.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Pattison tried to keep his citizens' spirits up. He decided to hang on to the bunker-like City Hall, which was built in the early 1970's to replace an ornate structure that burned in 1938. ''It would have been a death knell,'' he says. ''Selling your city hall, in a community with a lot of pride, does not motivate people.''</p>
        <p>So he and his city learned to make do. (His office still features its original ''space age'' white plastic and brown leather furniture, and the brown and blue carpeting has seen better days.) When the city could not afford new police cars, it bought 10 used ones. When it could not replace things, it repainted them.</p>
        <p>And in a break with precedent, Mr. Pattison and Mr. Bruno managed to put politics aside and work together to bring new development into Troy. ''Believe me,'' Mr. Bruno said, ''I had a lot of naysayers approaching me and saying, ''Let 'em sink.' ''</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Bruno helped Troy get about $4 million a year in state aid for distressed cities. He had money appropriated to turn some abandoned storefronts on the main square into a new arts center. He provided $2 million to renovate the Rice Building, a fabulous edifice designed by Calvert Vaux, to accommodate small high-technology companies affiliated with Rensselaer Polytechnic.</p>
        <p>And he managed to have more than 1,000 state workers stationed in Troy.</p>
        <p>All those office workers have been a lure for shopkeepers like Gary H. Kiddney and Steven R. Fox, who last year moved their gift shop, Mary Elizabeth, into downtown Troy from a nearby mall. ''We saw it as a golden opportunity, even when everyone else saw it as a pit,'' Mr. Kiddney said.</p>
        <p>Many of his customers are people stopping in on their breaks or lunch hours, like Susan Harris, a probation officer for Rensselaer County, who was picking up some potpourri this week. ''We're starting to see some changes for the better,'' said Ms. Harris, who has lived in Troy for 35 years. ''This store is one of the improvements.''</p>
        <p>The gift shop's success has, in turn, inspired other store owners, like John Waters, who just this week opened a new jewelry store near the arts center (Troy is sufficiently small that the mayor performed the ribbon-cutting). ''Five years ago, I wouldn't have come here,'' Mr. Waters said, adding that he initially thought about opening in a strip mall. ''But now there's a lot of foot traffic here.''</p>
        <p>Across the street, however, are vacant storefronts, a reminder of how far Troy still has to go before anyone can call it vibrant. Nearby, a big block of buildings, supposed to house fledgling businesses, has reverted to city ownership and is up for sale. Carmella Mantello, who ran against Mr. Pattison in November and got 45 percent of the vote, said her supporters were worried about crime and falling property values and rallied to her call for a tax cut.</p>
        <p>And a longtime mainstay of the city, the Thomasville Home Furnishings Store (nee Nellick's) will leave the building on River Street where it has been since 1913, and move next spring to a mall. Barry Goldberg, the store's owner, said that customers these days prefer to shop at malls, where all the merchandise is on one floor, as in all the other Thomasville stores around the country.</p>
        <p>Troy's partisans argue, however, that their city's genuineness and uniqueness are what will save it -- and are already attracting people. Sure, there may not be a Starbucks, but there's Barb's Coffee-Tyme, Open 24 Hours, and Famous Lunch, where $2.98 buys you four small chili dogs, a can of soda, and conversation with a waitress who knows everybody's name (and dental problems).</p>
        <p>''We have what everyone else is trying to build -- a cute small town,'' said Joe Fama, executive director of the Troy Architectural Program. ''We have the actual buildings Disney spends $3 million'' to copy.</p>
        <p>As for Mayor Pattison, he remains both optimistic and cautious.</p>
        <p>''We've had micro successes -- tremendous victories -- but we still have macro problems,'' he said. As a society, he added, ''We have to decide whether we want small cities -- because they really depend on state and federal support.''</p>
        <p>The Other Economy</p>
        <p>Upstate New York, a vast, diverse landscape of old cities, small towns, farms and forests stretching from Buffalo to Albany and north to the Canadian border, was once one of the most populous and prosperous regions of the country. But the national economic boom that swept into New York City and its suburbs passed it by. This is the fifth article of a series that began April 9 examining the region's quest for prosperity.</p>
