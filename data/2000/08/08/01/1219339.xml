        <p>Moving beyond its historical dominance of vanity diamonds, De Beers, the South African mining company, made an unsolicited $306 million offer to buy Ashton Mining Ltd., the Australian company that is the world's largest supplier of industrial-use diamonds. The bid is the third takeover attempt of another diamond business this year by De Beers, which is facing increased competition and is trying to reposition itself in the industry. After years of managing stockpiles and controlling prices by purchasing surpluses, the company has been moving to acquire diamond sources.</p>
