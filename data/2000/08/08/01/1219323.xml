        <p>Even though many Republicans worry more about losing the House than capturing the presidency, Gov. George W. Bush's team has given the House campaign effort no prime time for the week and indeed just half an hour of throw-away time at midday today.</p>
        <p>But nobody from the Congressional wing of the Republican Party could be found to complain that Mr. Bush was putting his election ahead of theirs.</p>
        <p>Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee, said the un-prime time was just fine, even though the Republican majority, with a margin of just 13 seats, is not as good shape as the Bush candidacy appears to be.</p>
        <p>''The governor is going to be our spokesman,'' Mr. Davis said, adding that for Republicans, ''Bush is a great brand name.''</p>
        <p>And 29 of his candidates made the most of their allotted 60 seconds on stage. John Kline, challenging an incumbent in the suburbs of St. Paul, walked quickly onstage, promised to ''return control of our schools to the parents of Minnesota and take it away from the bureaucrats of Washington,'' and dashed off.</p>
        <p>Back home in Eagan, Mr. Kline's supporters watched carefully as a television camera recorded their cheers at Joe Sensor's Restaurant. It made the noon news. Mr. Kline said later that it was ''a big help.''</p>
        <p>The Senate, where retaining Republican control seems more likely but the margin of majority is now only eight after the death of Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia, also got a midday half-hour, under the control of its campaign chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.</p>
        <p>Recalling his state's Kentucky Derby, Mr. McConnell valiantly tried to persuade the half-empty hall that there was more than a first-place bet on Mr. Bush on the board; there was  a trifecta, a wager in which the bettor picks the first three finishers.</p>
        <p>''Winning a trifecta takes real skill,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''The true measure of victory in addition to George W. Bush winning the White House is keeping a Republican Senate and a Republican House.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McConnell put six candidates forward. There were two embattled incumbents, Spencer Abraham of Michigan and Rod Grams of Minnesota, and four competitors for open  seats, Representatives Bob Franks of New Jersey and Bill McCollum of Florida, former Representative John Ensign of Nevada and Attorney General Don Stenberg of Nebraska.</p>
        <p>And Mr. McConnell alluded to one other high-profile race, the one in New York, saying, ''We're going to elect a Republican to the United States Senate who is actually from New York.'' But he never said the words ''Rick Lazio.''</p>
        <p>Later Mr. McConnell said in an interview that Representative Lazio had been offered one of the five-minute speaking slots for Senate candidates but had ''turned us down.'' In New York, Mr. Lazio's staff said he had better uses for his time. He had no public campaign schedule today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio was mentioned, but by his would-be House successor, Joan Johnson, the Islip town clerk, who said she would ''follow in the footsteps of Rick Lazio.'' With an acute sense of timing, Ms. Johnson, who is black, said, ''I will make history.''</p>
        <p>And as the audience expected her to proclaim herself the first black Republican woman in Congress, she said instead, ''I will be the first Republican woman ever elected to Congress from Long Island.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's opponent was also mentioned -- by Mr. Franks, who said his own opponent, Jon Corzine, was ''pushing Hillary Rodham Clinton's failed health care plan.''</p>
        <p>Most candidates sought to tie themselves to Mr. Bush, none more forcefully than Mr. Stenberg, who complained that his argument before the Supreme Court for his state's ban on a particular type of abortion need not have been unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>''If I had one more conservative justice,'' he said, ''Nebraska's ban on partial-birth abortion would have been upheld. President George W. Bush can make that happen.''</p>
        <p>Some House candidates had highly individualistic messages -- sometimes intended to distinguish them from their district's general assumptions about Republicans.</p>
        <p>Former Representative Dick Zimmer, hoping to unseat Representative Rush D. Holt in central and western New Jersey's 12th District, cited a ''strong Republican legacy that the environment will be protected for generations to come.''</p>
        <p>Others seemed to benefit from the speechwriting assistance of the campaign staff. ''Faith, family and freedom'' was a central message for both Dunn Lampton of Mississippi and Chuck Yob of Michigan.</p>
        <p>The lucky 29 seemed thrilled. Mark Nielson, challenging Representative Jim Maloney in southwestern Connecticut, said, ''They say everybody has 15 minutes of fame, and so I know it was only one minute, and therefore I still have 14 left.''</p>
        <p>While senators and would-be senators were given five minutes, the House hopefuls and Representative James E. Rogan of California, the only struggling incumbent to receive stage time, may not have been aware of the training they were receiving with their one. House members most often speak for only a minute, though they get to revise and extend their remarks and make them look longer in the Congressional Record.</p>
        <p>THE REPUBLICANS: THE CHALLENGERS  Correction:  September 11, 2000, Monday  An article on Aug. 1 about the role played by Congressional candidates at the Republican National Convention, and a chart listing their speeches, misspelled the surname of the Republican who is challenging Representative James Maloney in Connecticut. The name was also misspelled in a picture caption on March 4 about the campaign for the House. The challenger is Mark Nielsen, not Nielson. The errors were discovered last week during research for another article about House races.</p>
