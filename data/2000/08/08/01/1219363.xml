        <p>The information storage company, Storage Technology, reported second-quarter earnings of $8.7 million, its first operating profit in nine months and one that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The news lighted a fire under the company's shares, which rose $2.75, or 27 percent, to close at $12.875. The company said its second-quarter profit was 9 cents a share, before revamping charges, beating the average analyst forecast of 5 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Second-quarter revenue, however, fell 22 percent, to $513 million.</p>
