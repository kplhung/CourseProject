        <p>President Clinton took on the Republicans and their platform today in a series of Florida appearances that raised more than $1.2 million for his party and rallied support for his plan to expand Medicare to provide prescription drug insurance.</p>
        <p>Speaking to Medicare beneficiaries at a community center in Tampa, the president continued his attack on the host of tax cuts being passed by the Republican-controlled Congress.</p>
        <p>''You may hear, if you turn on the television, the Republicans, when they meet in Philadelphia in convention, talking about all their tax-cut bills and how wonderful they'd be for you,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''But what they don't say is that if you take all their tax-cut proposals in total, it spends the entire projected surplus of the country for the next 10 years.''</p>
        <p>He compared tax-cut legislation being sent to him by Congress to the choices a diner faces at a well-stocked restaurant: ''When I go to a cafeteria, everything I see looks good. But if I eat it all, I'll get sick.''</p>
        <p>Accompanied by Bill Nelson, the Florida insurance commissioner, who is running for the Senate, Mr. Clinton also told Democratic donors in Tampa and later in Palm Beach that the Republican goal was to blur the differences between the parties on health care, the economy, gun control, the environment and other issues that matter to voters.</p>
        <p>''Their strategy is to talk about compassion,'' and ''it's a brilliant strategy,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''It's a pretty package, and they're hoping if they wrap it tight enough, nobody will open it before Christmas.''</p>
        <p>At a fund-raising reception here for Mr. Nelson, the president emphasized that the Democratic strategy should be to stay positive -- ''you don't have to say a bad word about our opponents,'' he said -- but to explain to voters how the parties differ.</p>
