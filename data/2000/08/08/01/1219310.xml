As Mr. Gore, his wife, Tipper, and their daughters Karenna and Sarah  walked along the surf on Figure Eight Island for a photo opportunity, reporters asked whether Mr. Gore had narrowed the field and how his convention speech was coming.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gore suggested in a gesture that the field was narrowing, holding her hands about two feet apart, closing up the space then expanding it again.</p>
