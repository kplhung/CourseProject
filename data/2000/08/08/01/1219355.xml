        <p>A loss to Norway, a team the American women will face in the opening round in the Olympics, is not what they had in mind in the last game of their 19-day, five-game European trip. The Americans did not play like the Olympic or World Cup champions they are in the 2-1 loss on Sunday in Oslo.</p>
        <p>Coach April Heinrichs was unhappy that her players waited until there were 20 minutes left in the match before displaying any urgency.</p>
        <p>The Americans are 2-3-1 this year against the Norwegians.</p>
        <p>Norway and the United States are considered co-favorites, and China and Brazil are expected to offer strong challenges in Australia.</p>
        <p>Before they travel to Australia for the Olympics, the American women will play Russia on Aug. 13 in Annapolis, Md.; Canada on Aug. 20 in Kansas City, Mo.; and Brazil on Sept. 1 in San Jose, Calif. The team will then travel to San Diego before departing on Sept. 4.</p>
        <p>The United States men's Olympic team beat Bolton of the English First Division, 1-0, on Sunday in Indianapolis. Sasha Victorine of the Los Angeles Galaxy scored the goal.</p>
        <p>Coach Clive Charles, whose team is 7-4-1 this year, said the most important thing about the game against Bolton was that he was able to assess his players further. Charles has 24 players on his roster and he has to cut it down to 18 by the middle of the month. In contrast to the women's extensive schedule this year, the men's team will meet one more time for a training camp and an exhibition game to be announced in the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER</p>
        <p>The MetroStars are not the only team to have turned things around. The Kansas City Wizards, who were Major League Soccer's second-worst team last season, are now tied with the MetroStars for most points. Their five losses are the fewest among the league's 12 teams.</p>
        <p>Along with Coach Bob Gansler, Tony Meola has been responsible for the Wizards' turnaround. Meola is the league's top goalkeeper with a remarkable 0.77 goals against average and league-record 13 shutouts. He has started all 22 games for the Wizards (12-5-5, 41 points).</p>
        <p>Meola has been playing so well that he is expected to get a call for World Cup qualifying games against Barbados, Costa Rica and Guatemala when United States Coach Bruce Arena announces the roster next week.</p>
        <p>''I'm not at liberty to say anything, but it looks good,'' Meola said at the M.L.S. All-Star Game last weekend in Columbus, Ohio. ''We'll have to wait until Bruce announces the team.''</p>
        <p>Meola, who started in goal for the West, played the entire first half and allowed three goals. Gansler, who coached the West team, then used the skilled Meola as a striker in the latter stages of the game.</p>
        <p>GERMANY</p>
        <p>Bayern Munich looked impressive two weeks before the start of its Bundesliga title defense with a 4-1 victory over Kaiserslautern on Sunday to reach the final of the German League Cup. Bayern will play in its fourth consecutive final when it meets Hertha Berlin today. Hertha beat last year's runner-up, Bayer Leverkusen, on penalty kicks in the other semifinal on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Markus Babbel, who moved from Bayern Munich to Liverpool this season and was blamed for Germany's Euro 2000 defeat against England on June 17, may quit international soccer after coming under fire for his performances on the field and alleged actions off it. Television replays showed that Babbel was nearly 7 yards away from Alan Shearer, the player he should have been marking, when Shearer scored on a header that gave England its first victory over Germany in a major tournament since the 1966 World Cup final.</p>
        <p>Babbel was also accused by Lothar Matthaus, now with the MetroStars, of being involved in an attempt to oust Coach Erich Ribbeck before the tournament. But another German, Dietmar Hamann, denied Matthaus's account that he had led a revolt against Ribbeck, who quit after Germany's worst tournament showing in more than half a century.</p>
        <p>SPAIN</p>
        <p>It was back to work with a difference for the ex-Barcelona star Luis Figo of Portugal as he trained with his former archrivals at Real Madrid yesterday. Figo, who became the world's most expensive player late last month when he was transferred for $56.1 million, joined his new teammates for the first time at Real Madrid's training ground. He told reporters afterward about the difficulty of changing clubs to play for Barcelona's eternal rivals.</p>
        <p>Didier Deschamps, who was the captain of France's 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 championship teams, was officially introduced by Valencia yesterday. He was transferred from Chelsea in England for $5.24 million. In addition to the titles he has won with France, Deschamps has won two European Cups with Olympique Marseille and Juventus of Italy.</p>
        <p>FRANCE</p>
        <p>Olympique Marseille and Lens, two of of the country's disappointments last season, began the new campaign in impressive style under new coaches. Marseille, which barely avoided relegation last season, started with a 3-1 victory at home over Troyes that delighted the recently appointed Brazilian coach, Abel Braga.</p>
        <p>Lens, the 1998 champions who missed out on a place in the European tournaments, showed new-found determination under the former Marseille coach Rolland Courbis as they posted a 2-0 victory at Nantes on Saturday. Lens played the second half with 10 men after Antoine Sibierski was ejected in his debut against his former team.</p>
