        <p>Just three weeks after throwing New Jersey's Democratic Party into chaos by making a bid for governor of New Jersey, Senator Robert G. Torricelli abruptly abandoned the race today after an array of prominent Democrats said they would not support him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is coordinating 32 Senate races across the nation, had asserted that his national stature as a Congressional power broker gave Democrats the best chance to retake the governor's mansion, which has been controlled by Republicans for most of the last two decades.</p>

        <p>Just three weeks after throwing New Jersey's Democratic Party into chaos by making a bid for governor of New Jersey, Senator Robert G. Torricelli abruptly abandoned the race today after an array of prominent Democrats said they would not support him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is coordinating 32 Senate races across the nation, had asserted that his national stature as a Congressional power broker gave Democrats the best chance to retake the governor's mansion, which has been controlled by Republicans for most of the last two decades.</p>
        <p>But after prominent Democrats, including Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, announced that they would endorse his rival, James E. McGreevey, in the election next year, Mr. Torricelli said today that he was ending his candidacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli acknowledged today that he was ''humbled'' by his failure to generate widespread grass-roots support, but said he could not simultaneously run in a gubernatorial primary while carrying out his duties heading Democratic Senate efforts.</p>
        <p>''I was probably somewhat naive,'' Mr. Torricelli said of his plan to win support from party leaders quickly and wrest the nomination from Mr. McGreevey before the Democratic National Convention in mid-August. ''I thought that people would put their own interests aside to work toward the goal of something larger.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey, who nearly defeated Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in 1997, has been working ever since to build support for another attempt at the governor's office.</p>
        <p>Many political experts said Mr. Torricelli himself was to blame for his lukewarm reception by party leaders, whose support is crucial in New Jersey primaries because they determine which candidate's name appears on the party line. During his rapid ascent in Washington, Mr. Torricelli's sharp tongue and hot temper have made enemies of many Democrats who were only too eager to pay him back by rallying behind Mr. McGreevey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli's widely publicized investment in several private stock deals has also hurt his standing among voters, according to recent public opinion polls. And his 1996 Senate campaign, which is now entangled in a federal investigation that has brought guilty pleas from six contributors, was also a political liability, according to a private poll that the state party conducted over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Clifford Zukin, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said the decision to withdraw would seriously damage Mr. Torricelli's standing within the party and would be at least a temporary setback to any presidential ambitions he might harbor.</p>
        <p>''For a politician as seasoned as Torricelli, this is a huge misstep,'' Mr. Zukin said. ''He put a number of powerful Democrats into a very difficult position by entering this thing, which means he was going for it. So for him to drop out, this is a fundamental miscalculation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli turned New Jersey politics upside down three weeks ago, when he began lobbying county chairmen and labor leaders to support his quest for the party's nomination for governor in 2001. The governor's office in New Jersey, with broad powers, is considered one of the most powerful in the country, and the post is considered the supreme prize in state politics.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. McGreevey had already gathered the support of many Democratic leaders and raised $3.2 million for the state party in late June, Mr. Torricelli contended that his candidacy could unite the state's Democratic Party, which is engaged in a feud so bitter that leaders from South Jersey now refuse to meet with their counterparts from North Jersey.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McGreevey, the Woodbridge mayor, refused to be muscled aside. With the help of his political patrons, State Senators John A. Lynch and Raymond J. Lesniak, Mr. McGreevey locked up the support of the labor leaders and party chairmen he has courted assiduously since 1997 and prevented Mr. Torricelli from gaining endorsements from all seven counties in South Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli won the backing of some labor leaders and endorsements in Camden, Morris, Bergen and Burlington Counties. As recently as last Friday, Mr. Torricelli's closest advisers predicted that he would win the endorsement of party leaders in populous Essex and Hudson Counties early this week and gain a stranglehold on the nomination.</p>
        <p>But over the weekend, the state party's polling found that Mr. McGreevey, who has run almost nonstop for the last six years, led Mr. Torricelli among likely primary voters by 35 percent to 31 percent. When asked whether the controversies surrounding the senator's personal finances and campaign fund-raising would affect their decision, more than 20 percent of likely voters said it would make them less likely to support Mr. Torricelli, said a party official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>When Mayor James announced his endorsement today, along with other Essex County leaders, including State Senator Richard Codey, it was clear that Mr. Torricelli would face a bitter and divisive primary. The state party chairman, Thomas Giblin, said he was grateful that Mr. Torricelli decided to withdraw rather than further fracture the party, and said Democrats could now focus on helping Al Gore win the state's presidential vote and electing Jon S. Corzine to the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. McGreevey's victory however, there were few signs that the various factions of the party might resolve their differences soon.</p>
        <p>At the news conference announcing the endorsements, Mr. McGreevey, 42, took a swipe at Mr. Torricelli.</p>
        <p>''The Democratic Party is greater than any individual's political ambitions,'' he said. When Mr. Torricelli later withdrew from the race, Mr. McGreevey did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>George E. Norcross, the Camden County political leader and de facto head of the disaffected Democrats in South Jersey, said he thought that the party was still in a crisis.</p>
        <p>''It remains to be seen whether the wounds can be healed,'' Mr. Norcross said. ''This has created greater wounds than already existed.''</p>
        <p>In announcing his withdrawal from the race, Mr. Torricelli was sparing in his praise for Mr. McGreevey and refused to offer an endorsement. Instead, the senator mentioned two United States representatives who might consider seeking the nomination, Bill Pascrell and Frank Pallone, although most party leaders now consider that unlikely.</p>
        <p>When asked whether Mr. McGreevey might be able to unite the party in New Jersey and win the governor's office, Mr. Torricelli did not sound enthusiastic.</p>
        <p>''I hope that someone can,'' he  said.</p>
