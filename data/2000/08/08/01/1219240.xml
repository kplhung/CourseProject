        <p>With final results of the ''mega-election'' here on Sunday tabulated today, President Hugo Chavez has won an overwhelming personal victory, but his coattails were apparently not quite long enough to pull into Congress the followers needed to guarantee him absolute powers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez won 59 percent of the vote. But in the races for the National Assembly, pro-Chavez parties won 99 of 165 seats, which although impressive fell just short of the two-thirds majority that would have turned the new single-chamber legislature into a rubber stamp.</p>
        <p>The two-thirds watershed was crucial to Mr. Chavez's plans to carry out the ''peaceful social revolution'' he has promised supporters. With it he would have avoided any opposition resistance to decisions to discharge Supreme Court judges and members of Congress; decree certain laws; and appoint prosecutors, members of the Central Bank board and other officials.</p>
        <p>''What we need from here on in is to find the path to national unity,'' said Henrique Salas Feo, the opposition governor of the state of Carabobo, in what was seen as a veiled message to Mr. Chavez to be more conciliatory. ''The divisions must end, and we must all have the conviction that we are members of the same community.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Chavez's majority in the National Assembly is still large enough to assure passage of an ''enabling law'' that would allow him to decree at least some of the sweeping measures unpopular with the opposition. It was the granting of those special powers last year that allowed Mr. Chavez to dissolve the opposition-dominated Congress and take over the judicial system.</p>
        <p>Also working in his favor is the fact that his adversaries remain fragmented and demoralized. His main rival, Francisco Arias Cardenas, showed few gifts as a campaigner or orator, and the right-of-center political party that divided power for 40 years, called Copei, has all but vanished as an electoral force, winning only five seats in the new legislature.</p>
        <p>The traditional left-of-center party here, known as Democratic Action, did much better, and will be the second-largest political grouping in this nation of 23 million people, which in recent years has been the main source of oil imported by the United States. The party holds 32 seats in the National Assembly and won four or five governorships, depending on the outcome of one especially tight race.</p>
        <p>At the state level, Mr. Chavez did even better than expected. His Patriotic Pole coalition appears to have won at least 12 of 23 governorships, including the re-election of his father in his home state of Barinas, and also appears to have won a majority of the country's 336 mayoral races. Many political experts had predicted exactly the opposite outcome.</p>
        <p>The election Sunday to ''relegitimize'' Mr. Chavez's rule was required by a new Constitution whose formulation and approval by voters has been the main focus of his first 18 months in office. The Constitution significantly expands the powers of the federal government, especially the executive branch, while eliminating a ban on presidents immediately seeking re-election and extending their term of office to six years from five.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez quickly made it clear that he intends to take full advantage of all the new features and powers of the charter. In his victory speech early today, for instance, he indicated that he already plans to run for a second term, in hopes of being the nation's chief executive when Venezuela marks the bicentennial of its independence in 2011.</p>
        <p>In the speech, delivered from the balcony of the presidential palace here, Mr. Chavez mocked Mr. Arias Cardenas and other political rivals, but took an unusually conciliatory tone toward business leaders who have frequently been objects of his wrath.</p>
        <p>''We are all sailing in the same boat,'' he said, adding that he needed them to ''help save the Venezuelan economy,'' which contracted by 7.2 percent last year despite record high oil prices.</p>
        <p>Business leaders responded optimistically to that olive branch. ''If he is holding out a hand, now is the time to shake it,'' said Antonio Herrera, vice president of the Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, differences persist over how to make the economy grow. In the victory speech, Mr. Chavez made a point of saluting his minister of planning and development, Jorge Giordani, and of finance, Jose Rojas, who have taken most of the criticism for his economic policies.</p>
        <p>To Robert Bottome, publisher of Veneconomia, the country's leading business newsletter, the declaration of support did not bode well. ''Nothing makes me think this president is willing to change his policies,'' he said. ''If you don't change Giordani and Rojas, you don't change anything.''</p>
        <p>Whatever course he takes, Mr. Chavez will be under pressure to deliver results soon. When Edelmira de Gil, a Chavez supporter, was asked Sunday at a polling place here how long she would be willing to wait before seeing an improvement, she quickly replied, ''three or four months.'' If Mr. Chavez ''doesn't keep his word,'' she warned, ''he won't get re-elected.''</p>
