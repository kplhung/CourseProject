        <p>Special report, Policing Pop, focuses on remarkable shift in way record companies and radio stations handle explicit lyrics as well as inconsistencies in their methods; song-lyric review and editing procedures have become routine within industry that held itself up as free-speech champion in 1980's and early 1990's as record-buying audience grows younger and political and business pressures on record companies mount; singers are being asked to repeat lyrics, edit out particular words and even excise entire songs from albums; in addition, changes made to songs for radio play are often far more extensive than simple editing required to make them conform to federal regulations (M)</p>

        <p>Something seemed a little strange when the Los Angeles hip-hop radio station Power 106 played a song from an album by pop's biggest current star, the 27-year-old white rapper Eminem, that had not yet been released as a single. Trying to mask offensive lyrics, the station bleeped out a derogatory term for blacks but left in a derogatory term for gays.</p>
        <p>On the so-called clean version of the full-length Eminem album, ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' (No. 3 on the pop charts after two months as No. 1), the record label has excised entire tracks to create an alternative album that parents can buy for their children. In the remaining songs, the lyrics have been extensively edited -- up to 60 times in a single song -- to eliminate references to drugs, violence, profanity and hate. Most anti-gay slurs have been removed, while a derogatory term for women remains, cropping up scores of times.</p>

        <p>Something seemed a little strange when the Los Angeles hip-hop radio station Power 106 played a song from an album by pop's biggest current star, the 27-year-old white rapper Eminem, that had not yet been released as a single. Trying to mask offensive lyrics, the station bleeped out a derogatory term for blacks but left in a derogatory term for gays.</p>
        <p>On the so-called clean version of the full-length Eminem album, ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' (No. 3 on the pop charts after two months as No. 1), the record label has excised entire tracks to create an alternative album that parents can buy for their children. In the remaining songs, the lyrics have been extensively edited -- up to 60 times in a single song -- to eliminate references to drugs, violence, profanity and hate. Most anti-gay slurs have been removed, while a derogatory term for women remains, cropping up scores of times.</p>
        <p>These and other such incidents show a remarkable change in the way record companies and radio stations now handle explicit lyrics as well as the inconsistencies in these methods. In the 1980's and early 90's  major music labels held themselves up as free-speech champions as they fought against pressure groups attacking specific songs. But today, as  the record-buying audience grows  younger, and political and business pressures on record companies mount, song-lyric review and editing procedures have become routine.</p>
        <p>Artists are regularly asked to sing lyrics again, edit out particular words and even excise entire songs from albums. In addition, changes made to songs for radio play are often far more extensive than the simple editing required to make them conform to federal regulations.</p>
        <p>Universal Music, the nation's biggest record label, now has a review board of employees representing different races and both sexes. The board screens the lyrics of every record the company releases for explicit language. As a result, recent albums by rappers like Eminem, Dr. Dre and Juvenile  have lyrics that are bleeped or excised from all copies of their albums -- not just the clean versions -- in a practice that has never existed to such a degree in the industry.</p>
        <p>Although every major music label creates edited versions of explicit singles for radio and clean versions of albums (which can account for 10 to 15 percent of sales for an artist like Eminem), those speaking for major labels outside the Universal system denied having formal committees to review lyrics. Many music executives, however, say review boards are widespread.</p>
        <p>''It's getting like we almost have a McCarthyism in the business,'' said Phyllis Pollack, a press agent who has worked with some of rap's most notorious groups, including N.W.A. and the Geto Boys. ''But the censorship isn't new; what's new is the fear and the compliance going on to this extent. And I think a lot of artists go along with it because they're afraid of being lost in the corporate shuffle and falling out of favor with their labels.''</p>
        <p>Hilary Rosen, the president of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group representing the major labels,  said that the attention paid to lyrics was not a matter of McCarthyism but a means of balancing several different responsibilities.</p>
        <p>''Every label has a review board, or at least someone reviews the music,'' she said. ''I think it's a combination of both not wanting to stifle artists, but wanting what I feel is a very real sense of corporate and social responsibility. The political pressures are real, but I think just as importantly, executives and artists care about the parenting issues.''</p>
        <p>Industry executives and experts cite many other possible reasons for the increased vigilance. Some see it as a response to the increasing cultural dominance of hip-hop, generally a more verbally explicit genre than rock and pop.</p>
        <p>Others point to the increased share of the music market -- 10 to 20 percent for popular artists -- represented by chains like Wal-Mart and Kmart, which refuse to carry albums with parental advisory stickers. And some complain that the industry is giving ground to conservative critics like William J. Bennett, the Rev. Pat Robertson and Senator  Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas. These shifts in the handling of explicit content also come as record labels are seeking government help in their war against unauthorized downloading of music from the Internet, and high-stakes corporate mergers are making many companies more financially and musically conservative.</p>
        <p>''There's no rhyme or reason to what we're made to do,'' complained a top executive at one major label who, like many  interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity because he said he felt caught between artists' rights and the demands of more conservative retailers.</p>
        <p>J-Flexx, a rapper who has written No. 1 hits for Dr. Dre and others, has another theory about the changing attitude toward  explicit content. ''I don't think the industry has such high morals,'' he said. ''I think the industry goes to whoever's buying the music. When gangsta rap was selling four or five years ago, everyone was looking for something hard. But right now pre-teens are buying the records, so the industry is looking at lyrics real closely and catering to them.''</p>
        <p>In many cases there are dozens, sometimes more than a hundred, different versions of a popular single floating around, most of them edited by individual radio stations with no contractual relationship with the artist. But as artists like Eminem are attacked for homophobic and misogynistic lyrics, critics are noticing that those trying to clean up these lyrics have their own faults. The sanitized songs, they say,  are full of inconsistencies and double standards that reveal as much about the sensitivities -- or lack of them -- of the industry expurgators as they do about the artists.</p>
        <p>One example is on the recent Eminem CD. A new song was added to the cleaned-up version to replace one about domestic violence. Titled ''Kids,'' it is a tongue-in-cheek anti-drug rap that parodies the cartoon ''South Park.'' But while much of the hate speech and references to violence and drug and alcohol abuse have been cut out of the album (even to the extreme of removing all instances of the words ''kill,'' ''hit,'' ''slit,'' ''shoot,'' ''O.D.'' and ''Zig-Zag''), in this new  song a student makes fun of a teacher, laughing and saying, ''He's got AIDS.''</p>
        <p>''It's disturbing to me that they even have to make a clean version of a record and eliminate certain things,'' said Danny Goldberg, founder of Artemis Records and the former president of Mercury Records. ''But if retailers want to eliminate things that offend some people, why does that not apply to language that's offensive to gays and lesbians?''</p>
        <p>Executives at Interscope Records and its parent company, Universal, declined to comment on the Eminem inconsistencies or to discuss anything related to the screening or editing of content. But elsewhere, one top-ranking major label executive said that creating a clean version of a record at his label was a haphazard process with no rules and that it was usually done by an unsupervised junior staff member at a computer.</p>
        <p>The finished product, the executive added, is not approved by anyone at the label, in part because it is ''annoying to listen to'' with all the missing lyrics, not unlike a cell phone conversation in an area with bad reception.</p>
        <p>Scott Seomin, the entertainment media director of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said the music business had been far less sensitive than other entertainment industries about the concerns of gay people.</p>
        <p>''As far as radio stations and record labels acting responsibly, it basically comes down to a different standard that is in place for the gay and lesbian community, and also for women,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But these are not the only groups feeling  overlooked by those who edit songs. Many other minority group representatives, in addition to parents associations, have complaints. And rappers say they are singled out for lyric review, song editing and parental advisory stickers more often than rock acts.</p>
        <p>When the Murderers, an African-American rap group, was told by Universal to remove lyrics about violence against police officers and gays from its forthcoming album, the rapper Ja Rule seethed. He told reporters he was upset about the label's hypocrisy: why, he asked, did executives make him remove slurs against gays and the police but say nothing about the band's equally derogatory references to blacks?</p>
        <p>Instances of record labels taking such precautionary measures go as far back as the mid-1950's, when Little Richard, in recording ''Tutti Frutti,'' is said to have worked with a hired lyricist to clean up the risque lyrics of his live version. But many date the modern era of creating clean versions to the obscenity complaints generated by 2 Live Crew's 1989 album, ''As Nasty as They Wanna Be,'' which was also released in an edited version called ''As Clean as They Wanna Be.'' Three years later, the ante for labels was upped by protests over the song ''Cop Killer'' by Ice-T's rock band, Body Count; law enforcement organizations and Time Warner shareholders pressured the label to remove it from the album.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Universal, who nonetheless insisted that his name not be used, confirmed the existence of a formal board that screens all lyrics before a record with a parental advisory sticker can be released. Some of Universal's subsidiary labels, like MCA, have also instituted review panels, meaning that some records have to pass through two committees before being released. As a result, some artists have lyrics noticeably edited or obscured in every version of their albums, making it impossible to hear a song as it was intended to be heard.</p>
        <p>This occurs on recent albums by  Eminem, Dr. Dre and Juvenile. On ''What's the Difference,'' on Dr. Dre's ''Chronic 2001,'' a computerized female voice is inserted to obscure a lyric in which Dr. Dre venomously insults another rapper. On the Eminem record, at least two small passages have been dropped: one sympathizing with the Columbine killers in ''I'm Back,'' another a graphic insult directed at Eminem's own family in the rap ''Marshall Mathers.'' On the Juvenile record ''400 Degreez,'' for some reason the word ''homicide'' has been removed from ''Gone Ride With Me''  while all other references to violence and gunplay on the album remain.</p>
        <p>The Universal spokesman said Universal would neither disclose the names of those on the review board nor permit interviews with them. But executives at other record companies and at radio stations were willing to discuss the editing process, and the consensus was that there was no consensus. What can be played at night on the radio is not the same as what can be played during the day; what's suitable for a modern rock station might not float at an oldies station; what's right for Manhattan might not fly in Little Rock.</p>
        <p>Kevin Liles, president of the urban labels Def Jam and Def Soul Records (which includes Sisqo, a rhythm-and-blues singer,  and Redman, a rapper), said there was one  employee whose job was to pore over lyric sheets with a red pen, circle the explicit lyrics, show them to him and then sit at the computer covering up all offending words with sound effects to create a clean version. In extreme cases, he said, he will ask an artist to sing new lyrics, leaving the offensive words out. In a new single by DMX and Sisqo, for example, the rappers went back into the studio to change the chorus of ''what these bitches want from a nigger'' to ''what you really want.''</p>
        <p>''Some artists feel that's messing with their artistic creativity,'' Mr. Liles said. ''But that's limiting themselves. From our side, we want them to get the maximum amount of airplay, and it's our job as a record company to explain that to them.''</p>
        <p>But often a radio station will return a song to Def Soul anyway, saying that it is still too explicit. Then the label will create an even tamer rendition, which it refers to as a  superclean version.</p>
        <p>Other stations, however, find record label editing too strict. Oedipus, the program director at the modern rock station WBCN in Boston, said he often ended up discarding a label's radio version of a single and re-editing the song at the station to allow more lyrics through. For example, he said, when his station decided to play Eminem's ''Stan,'' he listened to the record company version and then decided to make his own.  ''They took out the part where he says, 'Shut up, bitch' when his girlfriend is in the truck, and we didn't take that out.''</p>
        <p>''Bad taste is not against the law, so we let the audience decide for itself,'' he said. ''The only decisions we make are ones to protect the license.''</p>
        <p>A radio station may be fined by the Federal Communications Commission if it broadcasts -- during hours when children may be listening -- any of seven objectionable words, one of which was not edited out of the record company's clean version of the Eminem CD, or material that is patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, especially references  to sexual or excretory functions and organs. Clearly, many of the changes made to create  radio versions of singles -- particularly new or excised lyrics that remove drug terminology, derogatory expressions and references to violence -- are not necessary according to those broadcast provisions, though they may be a relief to parents.</p>
        <p>In the retail world, executives pointed out, the parental warning stickers affixed to records with explicit lyrics are put there solely at the discretion of the record label, with no rules determining lyrics' inclusion or exclusion.</p>
        <p>One manager of several rock bands, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he regularly sent advance copies of lyric sheets and cover art to Anderson Merchandisers, the CD supplier to chains like Wal-Mart and Kmart. Often, Anderson will suggest lyrics and artwork that should be changed in a clean version; sometimes, if it is just a matter of making one or two minor modifications, the changes will be made to all copies of an album to avoid the expense of creating a clean version, the manager said. But because the resulting clean CD's often make it to Wal-Mart and Kmart without being screened again, discrepancies still abound. This means, for example, that the clean copies they carry of Eminem's ''Marshall Mathers LP'' still contain the word ''bitch,'' while the clean copies they carry of DMX's ''And Then There Was X'' edit out the exact same word. (Anderson did not return several phone calls for comment.)</p>
        <p>''The solution isn't to impose standards,'' said Nina Crowley of the Massachusetts Music Industry Coalition, a free-speech organization. ''It's to not expect labels and television and radio stations to do your parenting for you.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Crowley pointed out an example of random editing from music television programming that captured the inconsistencies plaguing the process. In a VH-1 documentary about the rap producer Dr. Dre, she noticed that the word ''nigger'' was obscured visually in a lyric sheet but at the same time could be heard loud and clear in the music. (A VH-1 spokesman said the word had been left in by mistake and had since been bleeped out.</p>
