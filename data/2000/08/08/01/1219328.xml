        <p>It was the start of a new National Football League season in a new millennium.

        <p>It was the start of a new National Football League season in a new millennium. Making their preseason debuts were a new New England Patriots head coach (Bill Belichick), a new San Francisco 49ers owner (Denise DeBartolo York), a new San Francisco 49ers quarterback (Jeff Garcia) and a new Patriots bold blue-and-silver uniform.</p>
        <p>And, of course, it was the debut of a new ''Monday Night Football'' broadcast team, which included the comedian Dennis Miller.</p>
        <p>The Patriots and the 49ers -- nonplayoff teams last season at 8-8 and 4-12, respectively -- are desperately embracing a fresh start. New England jumped quickly toward that goal, dominating the 49ers early and coasting to a 20-0 victory in the annual Hall of Fame preseason game before 22,840 fans tonight at Fawcett Stadium.</p>
        <p>The night was fanciful as the Hall of Fame class of 2000 -- Howie Long, Ronnie Lott, Joe Montana, Dan Rooney and Dave Wilcox -- was saluted at halftime. Each inductee was enshrined here on Saturday and stayed around for a weekend of glowing and emotional tributes from fans and peers. Montana and Lott even hung around on the 49ers' sideline tonight in the first half, assisting the coaches and players.</p>
        <p>Too bad neither could suit up.</p>
        <p>The 49ers are in a full-bore rebuilding mode. The team of the 1980's, which won four Super Bowls in that decade and another in 1994 en route to an N.F.L.-record 16 consecutive 10-victory seasons from 1983 through 1998, looks weak and wobbly.</p>
        <p>San Francisco did not run, block or tackle well. Its defense looked comical on a 25-yard Patriots scoring pass from quarterback Michael Bishop to running back Kevin Faulk, a play in which Faulk caught a short pass and zigged and zagged through several arm tackles.</p>
        <p>The 49ers looked like a team that was unstable and then suffered the loss of several injured players. They also looked like a team that got rid of 32 players from last season and added 36 rookies to its roster.</p>
        <p>San Francisco was a 12-4 team two seasons ago with Steve Young at quarterback but fell to 4-12 without him last season. Now that Young has retired, San Francisco seeks direction from Garcia and the rookies Giovanni Carmazzi and Tim Rattay and the journeyman Rick Mirer.</p>
        <p>Garcia was effective, completing 6 of 7 passes for 50 yards in a little more than a quarter of work. Carmazzi, from Hofstra University, looked dazed and overwhelmed in completing 3 of 7 for 19 yards with 2 sacks. Rattay, though, showed promise and a nice passing touch. It was the first game for the group, and it showed. Plenty of time for the 49ers to find a way to improve.</p>
        <p>Bill Walsh, the San Francisco vice president and general manager, said: ''We were focusing tonight on our rookies, and I thought they did all right. It's hard to tell about the team with so many injured guys out on defense. Tonight was just the start.''</p>
        <p>For the Patriots, it was a refreshing start. Quarterback Drew Bledsoe played in only the game's first series and threw only three passes. But Bishop showed why everyone around the Patriots has been excited about his early play in training camp.</p>
        <p>Bishop, a second-year quarterback from Kansas State, not only threw for a touchdown but also ran for one, from 22 yards out. He exhibited poise and leadership with flair.</p>
        <p>As exciting for the Patriots was the running of Raymont Harris and Faulk. Both showed that the Patriots may have found an answer to their struggling ground game.</p>
        <p>''One of the reasons I came to the Patriots was because the coaches said I could be a leading back,'' said Harris, who sat out last season with a knee injury and signed as a free agent from Chicago. ''I felt good. I felt like I was young again, like 18. The players here expect to win and that is the environment I need to be around. I feel faster and stronger.''</p>
        <p>Belichick said: ''We really did not game plan. We just wanted to come out and run the stuff the players were confident from in practice. Our guys played hard and I was impressed with that. Over all, this was just effort and enthusiasm.''</p>
        <p>The Patriots' defense recorded four early sacks (two by the defensive end Willie McGinest) and the team committed only one first-half penalty.</p>
