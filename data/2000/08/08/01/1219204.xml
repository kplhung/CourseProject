        <p>Harriet Bass lay on a table at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, her right eye propped open by a metal ring, staring up at a red dot of light.</p>
        <p>''You're going to feel a little pressure,'' Dr. John A. Seedor told Ms. Bass, a 49-year-old casting director, as he was about to slice into her cornea. Using a motorized blade known as a keratome, Dr. Seedor cut a circular flap around the cornea, about one-third of an inch wide and one-150th of an inch thick, and peeled it back.</p>
        <p>Switching to a computer-controlled laser, Dr. Seedor trained an invisible beam of cool ultraviolet light on the exposed soft underlayers. The lenses within Ms. Bass's nearsighted eyes bent light too sharply, making her vision fuzzy. The laser vaporized bits of cornea in a way that flattened the curvature at the front of Ms. Bass's eye to bring images at the back of the eye, on the retina, into focus.</p>
        <p>''All right, Harriet. It looks beautiful,'' Dr. Seedor said. He placed the flap back down, caressing it with a brush back into place. ''Ready for the other eye?''</p>
        <p>Dr. Seedor repeated the procedure. The operation took about 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Although the Food and Drug Administration approved the procedure only last year, Lasik, short for laser in-situ keratomileusis, has quickly grown into a $3 billion-a-year industry, with 750,000 Americans expected to choose the surgery this year. Intended to correct nearsightedness, the procedure can now treat farsightedness as well.</p>
        <p>With 1.2 million American customers expected next year, Lasik is becoming the issue in a financial turf war between ophthalmologists and optometrists, between top-dollar surgeons and low-cost, high-volume centers.</p>
        <p>Ophthalmologists are the eye surgeons with medical degrees who perform the surgery. Optometrists are specialists in measuring vision who prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses, and, increasingly, handle the care before and after Lasik surgery.</p>
        <p>Lasik's popularity is easily explained: for the vast majority of patients, it is safe, effective and, increasingly, affordable.</p>
        <p>''It's a simple procedure,'' said Dr. Richard S. Koplin, medical director of LaserOne in Manhattan. ''It's not brain surgery.''</p>
        <p>With so many people willing to pay out of pocket -- most insurance companies do not pay for the procedure, because they regard it as ''cosmetic'' -- to be rid of contacts or glasses, Lasik surgeons have turned to the familiar marketing tools: celebrity testimonials, billboards, radio and television advertisements, telemarketing.</p>
        <p>For would-be patients, the choices -- LaserOne, Lasik Vision, the Laser Center, Insight Laser Center, Infinity Laser Center, among others -- can bewilder.</p>
        <p>Three general business models have evolved. Dr. Seedor is in the mode of a traditional practice: a patient pays for the attention and experience of the surgeon,  $2,650 an eye in Ms. Bass's case.</p>
        <p>Centers like Lasik Vision and LaserOne are decidedly corporate and mass market; Carmine Asparro of Bellmore, taking advantage of the grand opening special at Lasik Vision in Garden City, N.Y., paid just $500 for Lasik on his right eye. (His left already had 20/20 vision.)</p>
        <p>The third is an increasingly popular arrangement known as ''co-management'' in which a patient's optometrist handles the initial evaluation and postoperative care in exchange for part of the fee. The Laser Center in Manhattan, for example, works with about 75 optometrists who send a stream of patients. The optometrists make money from a procedure that eliminates the need for their services.</p>
        <p>At the Laser Center, Evan Mason of Irvington paid more than Ms. Bass: $5,500 for two eyes. Yet she never met her surgeon, Dr. Mark G. Speaker, before the surgery and has not seen him since. No studies have showed which approach yields better results, and all three have their critics and defenders.</p>
        <p>Marketing materials from the traditional Lasik surgeons often darkly hint that their cheaper competitors might be skimping to make a profit.</p>
        <p>Dr. Joseph Dello Russo of the New Jersey Eye Institute in Bergenfield charges $2,800 per eye. ''I know what I'm worth,'' he said. ''You're not going to get an experienced surgeon for $1,000 an eye.''</p>
        <p>Michael R. Henderson, president and chief executive of Lasik Vision Corporation, which runs centers in North America, is similarly emphatic. ''If you pay $5,000,'' he said, ''you're simply being gouged.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Susan Fromer, an ophthalmologist at Garden City Lasik Vision, says higher-cost surgeons can coexist with the high-volume centers. In addition to her work at Lasik Vision, Dr. Fromer also performs the surgery in her private practice in Manhattan, charging $3,600 for two eyes.</p>
        <p>In her practice, Dr. Fromer handles the evaluation and postoperation visits herself. At Lasik Vision -- which now charges $999 an eye after 1,000 people quickly signed up for the introductory special -- an optometrist on the staff handles those duties, although Dr. Fromer says she reviews the optometrists' data.</p>
        <p>''I believe in both models,'' Dr. Fromer said. ''It's an issue of handholding. The level of care is the same.''</p>
        <p>In the co-management debates, some ophthalmologists are concerned about the appearance of optometrists' steering patients their way.</p>
        <p>Others fear that optometrists may be slow to recognize complications after operations. The Laser Center is ''an economic model,'' said Dr. Joseph Evitar, a surgeon at Chelsea Eye Associates in Manhattan. ''You can't know what is really going on. You're relying on someone else's judgment.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Speaker, on the other hand, says he carefully chooses his co-managing optometrists. ''It wouldn't reflect well on me if I were associated with someone who wasn't knowledgeable,'' he said. The payment, 20 percent, is simply for the visits before and after. ''They are entitled to be paid for their services,'' he said, ''just like any other profession.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mason said she was not aware that $1,000 of the $5,000 she paid Dr. Speaker was going to her optometrist, Arkady Selenow, but that did not bother her. ''I trust Dr. Selenow,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Optometrists say they know their patients better and that results in better care.</p>
        <p>''It's not just a prescription,'' said Mr. Selenow, who practices in Manhattan and Queens and co-manages about 1,000 Lasik cases a year. ''It's knowing their complete lifestyle. You know if they're going to be happy. It's not just a science. There's an art to it, too.''</p>
        <p>For example, he said, a person who spends lots of time reading or staring at a computer screen might be dissatisfied with 20/20 vision, because up-close viewing might be uncomfortable. Leaving the vision slightly nearsighted might be a better option.</p>
        <p>With Ms. Mason, 44, Mr. Selenow steered her toward monovision, where her right eye was corrected to 20/20 vision, while her left eye was intentionally left a slightly nearsighted 20/40. That creates a sort of bifocal vision, with the right eye to focus on distant objects and the left eye for close-up reading.</p>
        <p>The sparring over co-management has escalated to the professional societies of ophthalmologists and optometrists.</p>
        <p>This year, the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery released a paper declaring that co-management should be ''an exceptional, rather than a routine, occurrence,'' applicable, say, to someone who lives far from the surgeon.</p>
        <p>''If the co-management of patients is done on a routine basis for predominantly financial reasons,'' the two organizations said, ''it represents unethical behavior and may be illegal.''</p>
        <p>The American Optometric Association countered, ''This conclusion is not grounded in law, regulation, or the American Academy of Ophthalmology's own Code of Ethics.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, the International Society of Refractive Surgeons, which includes ophthalmologists and optometrists, also said that co-management was acceptable and that it was developing guidelines for it.</p>
        <p>''Properly structured, legal co-management arrangements should not be cast under a pall just because they're co-management,'' said Dr. Jeffrey B. Robin, the society's executive vice president.</p>
        <p>While no study offers a comprehensive picture, anecdotes point to potential pitfalls.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marc Odrich, director of refractive surgery at Columbia and medical director of VISX, a laser manufacturer, tells of one co-managed Lasik patient referred to him.</p>
        <p>The woman's eyesight was worsening, and an exam quickly showed why: cataracts were clouding her lenses. Her optometrist had not spotted the problem. The ophthalmologist did not check and, relying on the optometrist, performed the operation. It went smoothly, but the cataracts render it useless.</p>
        <p>''I don't fault the optometrist,'' Dr. Odrich said. ''I fault the doctor who is operating on someone else's exam. You've got to do the exam. This doesn't absolve you from being a doctor.''</p>
        <p>Most Lasik patients encounter no problems at all, although 1 percent to 10 percent require a second Lasik operation to fine-tune their prescriptions.</p>
        <p>Still, complications do occasionally occur, some serious.</p>
        <p>During surgery, the flap-cutting keratome might jam or create a wrinkle in the cornea, in perhaps 1 in 500 eyes, said Dr. Jonathan Carr, director of medical services for the Lasik Vision chain.</p>
        <p>After surgery, a range of problems can arise, although most can be easily treated if caught promptly. And, about 1 in 500 will experience an inflammation under the eye, Dr. Carr said. The odds of an infection are about 1 in 10,000. And, there is one reported case of a 35-year-old man who had one eye removed after a Lasik-induced infection.</p>
        <p>The operation also cuts down on production of tears, leading to eyes that need drops. Almost always, the condition improves after a few months.</p>
        <p>For some, particularly those with large pupils, Lasik can result in nighttime glare and blurry halos around street lamps. Only rarely does bothersome glare persist longer than a few months, Dr. Carr said.</p>
        <p>Other surgical alternatives exist, including corrective lenses implanted in the cornea. That procedure costs about the same and is reversible.</p>
        <p>And, in June the F.D.A. approved a new procedure called laser thermal keratoplasty for treatment of mild to moderate farsightedness in people over 40. The condition affects an estimated 60 million Americans. The procedure takes less than three seconds: the thermal laser fires 16 bursts in two concentric rings, causing cornea tissue to shrink and steepening the edges.</p>
        <p>Improvements with Lasik are expected to help extremely nearsighted people and those with oddly shaped corneas. For most, Lasik already produces the results as promised.</p>
        <p>''I'm seeing perfect,'' Evan Mason said a couple of weeks after her surgery. ''It was perfect that night.'' Monovision, which she tested with contact lenses before her surgery, was also no problem. ''I adapted immediately.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Asparro, who took advantage of the special offered by Lasik Vision, is also a satisfied patient. ''I'm so happy I did it,'' he said. ''Love it. Would recommend it to anyone.''</p>
        <p>A couple of months after her surgery, Ms. Bass's vision is 20/50, not the intended 20/25. She has bought reading glasses.</p>
        <p>She has a second operation scheduled -- an ''enhancement'' in industry parlance and included in the original cost.</p>
        <p>''They think they have to do me again at the beginning of August,'' she said. ''It's not as easy as I thought it would be. I am not a disgruntled patient by any means. I'm still satisfied with the work because it's greatly improved over what I used to see.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 9, 2000, Wednesday  An article in Science Times on Aug. 1 about laser eye surgery misstated the title of an optometrist who often handles the patient care before and after Lasik surgery. He is Dr. Arkady Selenow, not Mr.</p>
