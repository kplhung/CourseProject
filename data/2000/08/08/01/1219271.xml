        <p>A woman who had lost custody of her newborn daughter because the infant had tested positive for cocaine kidnapped the week-old girl from a Manhattan hospital yesterday, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The police were searching last night for the baby and the woman, Carol Codrington, 29, of Tillitson Avenue in the Bronx, said Officer Gary Cillo, a department spokesman.</p>
        <p>Ms. Codrington had permission to visit and feed the infant at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, but was not allowed to take the girl out of the hospital, an investigator said.</p>
        <p>At 4:10 p.m. yesterday, however, Ms. Codrington walked out the door with the girl, who was born July 24, Officer Cillo said.</p>
        <p>The hospital would not say what security measures it had taken to keep the baby from being taken.</p>
        <p>''We are working with the local police in their investigation of this matter, and until further notice we have no further comment,'' said Andrew Miller, a spokesman for the hospital.</p>
        <p>Ms. Codrington has at least two other children that have been taken from her and put in foster care, said a spokeswoman for the Administration for Children's Services, Jennifer Falk, but she had no details.</p>
