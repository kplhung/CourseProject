        <p>A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY  By Laura Shaine Cunningham  287 pages. Riverhead Books. $24.95.</p>
        <p>In her charming 1989 memoir, ''Sleeping Arrangements,'' Laura Cunningham created an indelible portrait of her 1950's childhood in the Bronx. She conjured up a working-class world built on an absurdly grandiose scale: a world where apartment buildings sprouted Babylonian turrets and Egyptian friezes, and streets aspired to be wide Parisian thoroughfares, a now vanished world that once nurtured a young girl's romantic dreams.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cunningham's latest book is a kind of bookend to ''Sleeping Arrangements'': it chronicles the author's journey from the cacophonous streets of the city to the bucolic, bug-infested hills of upstate New York and her ongoing love affair with a farmhouse that she and her ex-husband bought 18 years ago.</p>

        <p>A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY  By Laura Shaine Cunningham  287 pages. Riverhead Books. $24.95.</p>
        <p>In her charming 1989 memoir, ''Sleeping Arrangements,'' Laura Cunningham created an indelible portrait of her 1950's childhood in the Bronx. She conjured up a working-class world built on an absurdly grandiose scale: a world where apartment buildings sprouted Babylonian turrets and Egyptian friezes, and streets aspired to be wide Parisian thoroughfares, a now vanished world that once nurtured a young girl's romantic dreams.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cunningham's latest book is a kind of bookend to ''Sleeping Arrangements'': it chronicles the author's journey from the cacophonous streets of the city to the bucolic, bug-infested hills of upstate New York and her ongoing love affair with a farmhouse that she and her ex-husband bought 18 years ago.</p>
        <p>Though often as engaging as ''Sleeping Arrangements,'' ''A Place in the Country'' lacks that earlier book's easy, organic shape: it reads less like a memoir than like a series of overlapping (and occasionally repetitive) magazine pieces. Some of the chapters are small, comic essays chronicling a city dweller's bumbling efforts to master the rudiments of country living: ''Green Acres'' meets ''A Year in Provence.'' Other chapters are more elliptical, melancholy accounts of Ms. Cunningham's attempts to grapple with health concerns and a failing marriage.</p>
        <p>The opening portions of the book recapitulate much of the material from ''Sleeping Arrangements,'' recounting the author's girlhood in the Bronx. Her early peripatetic life with her mother, it seems, instilled in her a craving for a real home: for the first four years of her life, Ms. Cunningham recalls, she and her mother sought shelter in relatives' overcrowded apartments, camping out in foyers, entryways, even under dining room tables. It was while sharing a three-room apartment with five other people that her dream of living in a stand-alone house took root, a dream shaped by her immigrant grandmother's memories of a country place, a dacha, back home in Russia.</p>
        <p>After an interlude in the suburban wilds of Tuxedo Park, N.Y. (a community she satirized in her 1980 novel, ''Third Parties''), Ms. Cunningham and her husband embarked on a 10-year search for the perfect country house: ''I did not want,'' she writes, ''a house with a mistaken identity -- a Mediterranean villa or an adobe house. I wanted a house that sprang naturally from its roots; a native place, a home farm,'' a house, in other words, ''without ego.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, they found their dream house several hours north of the city: a pale yellow colonial named The Inn, set on 13 acres, at the very center of what had once been a great estate. To one side lived Lord and Lady Hodgson, who had been selling off bits of the family estate over the years; to another side was a dairy farm owned and operated by a father and son team, Abner Bower Sr. and Abner Bower Jr.</p>
        <p>Like many former city dwellers, Ms. Cunningham and her husband soon succumbed to the ''have to'' mindset of ''the obsessive country place revisionist.'' Ms. Cunningham's passion became turning a cistern that had been boarded over for more than a century into a swimming pool, a project that would entail removing all the old water (which contained, she estimates, some five dozen rat skulls per 5,000 gallons), coating the pit with sealer and then refilling it with new water.</p>
        <p>As for her husband, Ms. Cunningham writes, he became obsessed with stocking their ''farm'' with animals: a menagerie that soon came to include two demented goats named Lulu and Lulubelle who devoured 50-pound sacks of Goat Chow like bags of potato chips, a half-dozen foul-smelling geese, 38 irritable chickens and a puffed-up rooster named Mr. Chicken who ''ate about a hundred dollars' worth of chicken feed a day'' and soon grew so large that he looked like ''an ad for a chicken or a person in a chicken suit.''</p>
        <p>Adept at poking fun at her and her husband's city-slicker dreams, Ms. Cunningham also gives us some delightful portraits of the people who became their neighbors and friends. She tells us about the Smithsons, another couple from the city, who stocked their pond with $10,000 worth of koi fish and installed a zen waterfall. She recalls Lord Hodgson phoning to apologize for ''the poor color of the foliage this year'' and hoping ''to do better for you next fall.'' And she memorializes the estate's late caretaker, Cecil Green, who for almost 60 years presided over the grounds, tending to the boilers in winter, the gardens in summer and the year-round mending of the fences.</p>
        <p>''Because of Cecil,'' she writes, ''I know windmills once stood behind my house, that potatoes grew in the yard, and that the foundation that walls my tennis court was once part of a great dairy barn. 'Mice chewed matches,' was how Cecil explained the fire that burned down the barn long before my time.''</p>
        <p>In the course of her own 18 years in the country, Ms. Cunningham says she has witnessed the gradual demise of a way of life. Nearby, she notes, malls ''were replacing mountains, spawning satellite strips like lunar landing stations, almost overnight.'' Modular houses were popping up like mushrooms in the fields, and light pollution was blanching the nighttime skies. By the turn of the millennium, Lord Hodgson had sold his manor house to the followers of an Indian swami, who had once visited the estate in the 19th century. And the Bowers, too, put their dairy farm on the block. Their farm equipment was sold at auction, the cows trucked away to a new home.</p>
        <p>A New York City psychiatrist bought the Bowers's farm for just over a million dollars and within days had workmen tearing down silos and installing lacquered doors. Ms. Cunningham, a city girl who by now had logged more years in the country than in New York, began thinking of borrowing some cows from a farmer down the road: she says she could no longer envision life without them.</p>
