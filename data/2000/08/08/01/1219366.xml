        <p>BJORLIN-Elizabeth S. (nee Falise). Of Ridgefield, CT and Bedford, NY died at the age of 41 at her home in Ridgefield, on Friday, July 28, 2000 after a courageous three and a half-year battle against cancer. After graduating with honors from Smith College and a semester at Oxford University, Beth enjoyed a growing career at Pepsico (after previous positions at Reader's Digest and Nestle) where her intellect, charm, dedication and genuine concern for other people, so well known by her loving family, were significantly recognized and appreciated. She is survived by her husband, Scott and two beautiful and bright daughters, Kari (7) and Kristen (4), a brother, William MacIntyre Gill, two sisters, Katherine Falise Knapp and Christina Falise and her loving parents, Katharine S. and Robert A. Falise. A memorial service will be held at 11 AM on Wednesday, August 2nd at St. Matthews Episcopal Church in Bedford, NY (on Route 22-Canitoe Road). In lieu of flowers, please send contributions to the Norma F. Pfriem Breast Care Center, 267 Grant Street, Bridgeport, CT 06610.</p>
