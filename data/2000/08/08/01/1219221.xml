        <p>An O'Neill Premiere</p>
        <p>Talk about a play's long journey to the stage. Ralph Waite and Daniel McDonald star in the first production of Eugene O'Neill's ''Personal Equation,'' beginning performances on Friday at the Provincetown Playhouse, 133 MacDougal Street, Greenwich Village. The play, set at the outbreak of World War I, was written in 1915, while the playwright was a Harvard student. The characters must decide whether to enlist in the army or the anarchist cause, a choice that divides a father (Mr. Waite) and son (Mr. McDonald). ''Personal Equation,'' which is at the start of the annual O'Neill festival of the Playwrights Theater of New York, has been staged by the group's artistic director, Stephen Kennedy Murphy.
