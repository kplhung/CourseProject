      <abstract>
        <p>Correction of information about Publishers Information Bureau's monitoring of Talk magazine's advertising pages, which was misstated in July 10 article</p>
      </abstract>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A report in the Media Talk column of Business Day on July 10 about an incentive offered by Talk magazine  to attract advertising from Bacara, a resort hotel in California, referred incorrectly to monitoring of Talk's advertising pages by the Publishers Information Bureau. The bureau indeed monitors Talk, and its figures differ from independent estimates by an industry executive that were used in the article. In February, the bureau counted 138.4 advertising pages, compared with 48.6 for the independent count, although the larger figure included a special advertising section. In March, it counted 48.8 pages, compared with 41.3; in April, 70.3 pages, compared with 70.8; and in June 36.2 pages, compared with 36.1.</p>
