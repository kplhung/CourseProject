        <p>Seeking to ensure the salvation of a Suffolk County hospital that was nearly shut down early this year, the New York State Dormitory Authority plans to sell up to $118.5 million in tax exempt bonds whose proceeds would be used to put the St. Catherine of Siena Medical Center on a sound, long-term financial footing.</p>
        <p>The center, in Smithtown, includes a 311-bed hospital that was previously St. John's Episcopal Hospital. Its former owner, Episcopal Health Services, declared bankruptcy last fall and said it would sell the hospital to Catholic Health Services of Long Island for nearly $100 million.</p>

        <p>Seeking to ensure the salvation of a Suffolk County hospital that was nearly shut down early this year, the New York State Dormitory Authority plans to sell up to $118.5 million in tax exempt bonds whose proceeds would be used to put the St. Catherine of Siena Medical Center on a sound, long-term financial footing.</p>
        <p>The center, in Smithtown, includes a 311-bed hospital that was previously St. John's Episcopal Hospital. Its former owner, Episcopal Health Services, declared bankruptcy last fall and said it would sell the hospital to Catholic Health Services of Long Island for nearly $100 million.</p>
        <p>But a labor dispute with the hospital's nurses in January nearly doomed the sale and brought the hospital to the brink of closing. The dispute was resolved, and the sale was completed in February. Officials said then that the hospital employed 1,700 people and that about 400 doctors regularly practiced there.</p>
        <p>Also sold was a 240-bed nursing home in the medical complex and a subsidized housing development next to the complex whose 298 apartments are largely occupied by the elderly. Most of the bond proceeds would be used to replace bank financing, which was used in making the purchases, with 30-year fixed-rate bonds whose tax exempt status would permit a lower interest rate. The rest of the bond money would be used for renovations and other costs.</p>
        <p>The authority hopes to sell the bonds late next month, a spokeswoman, Claudia Hutton, said yesterday. A hearing on the proposed sale is to be held on Aug. 15 at the agency's Manhattan offices at 1 Pennsylvania Plaza.</p>
