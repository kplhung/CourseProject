        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that the city would re-spray all of Staten Island tomorrow and Thursday with the pesticide Anvil as a ''prudent measure'' against the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>Although there have been no new discoveries of the mosquito-borne virus in birds since the first spraying of Staten Island on two separate nights last month, Mr. Giuliani said the number of dead birds found with the virus on Staten Island -- 13 at last count -- had prompted the spraying. No dead birds with the virus have been found in Manhattan, the Bronx or Brooklyn, and only three have been found in Queens.</p>
        <p>Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city's health commissioner, also said yesterday that an increasing number of mosquitoes found in traps in Staten Island was prompting the city to act. Dr. Cohen joined the mayor at a news conference announcing the spraying.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cohen said that the spraying, to be done from 10 p.m. tomorrow to 5 a.m. Thursday from trucks, was aimed at killing those mosquitoes not reached by the ground-spraying of Staten Island on the nights of July 19-20 and July 24-25.</p>
        <p>''There's always a population of mosquitoes that have recently fed who are not in the air on any given evening,'' Dr. Cohen said. He estimated that the initial ground-spraying of Staten Island might have missed 10 to 20 percent of the mosquito population. Those mosquitoes would breed and hatch more eggs over the course of a week, Dr. Cohen said. The lifespan of a mosquito is  about 8 to 10 days.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cohen said he was most concerned by the number of birds found infected with the virus on Staten Island. This indicated, he said, ''that there's a significant amount of viral transmission of West Nile virus in the borough that's in the bird population.''</p>
        <p>The birds include 11 crows, one blue jay and one sparrow. Recently hatched mosquitoes untouched by the first spraying could feed on those birds, Dr. Cohen said, and become infected.</p>
        <p>Health officials announced Friday that they had found nine more dead birds on Staten Island, bringing the total to 13, but said at the time they had no plans to spray the area again.</p>
        <p>Last year the virus killed 7 people and seriously sickened 55 others in the New York area. Infected birds are considered an important warning sign that the virus is present. Birds pass the virus to mosquitoes that bite them, and people can then be infected if they are bitten by those mosquitoes. No human has been found with the virus this year.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, the city has sprayed Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, health officials in Stamford, Conn., announced that they had found a dead crow infected with the West Nile virus, the first infected bird in that state. A Stamford health official said that area residents had collected 200 dead birds for testing in the past week.</p>
        <p>And in New Jersey yesterday, tests showed that six more crows found dead there were also infected with the virus, including the first ones found in Union County, state health officials said. That makes 15 infected crows found in New Jersey this year, said Dennis McGowan, a spokesman for the State Health Department.</p>
        <p>All counties in New Jersey spray bodies of water to kill mosquito larvae, and Sussex County has done limited ground spraying for adult mosquitoes, said Sharon Southard, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
