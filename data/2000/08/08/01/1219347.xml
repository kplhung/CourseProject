        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Adults as well as children need to know that being a vegetarian means more than just not eating meat (July 25).</p>
        <p>You must replace protein and calcium sources. Many think they will be healthier if they just take meat out of their diets. That is dangerous for many. To maintain nutrition and muscle mass, you must feed your body other sources like tofu and legumes.</p>
        <p>I recommend that parents who want to raise their children as vegetarians follow diets devised by physicians or dietitians. Carnivorous children don't like what adults eat, so why should vegetarian children be expected to follow an adult-oriented vegetarian diet? Vegetarian children require much more attention to their diets than their meat-eating peers and this takes very much planning and effort.</p>
        <p>I have been a vegan for 10 years and it is not easy, particularly in a culture that loves fast food and considers meat a staple.</p>
