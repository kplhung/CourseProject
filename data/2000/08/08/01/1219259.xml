        <p>Time Warner Inc. has made its first deal to allow an independent Internet service provider access to its cable system, a move that was made as the company seeks to be granted regulatory approval for its planned $121 billion acquisition by America Online Inc.</p>
        <p>Time Warner Cable has reached a preliminary agreement with Juno Online Services Inc. to offer high-speed Internet service to cable customers, the companies said today.</p>
        <p>The companies said dates for the start of the Juno service would depend on Time Warner's renegotiating its exclusive agreement with its Road Runner L.L.C., the only service provider currently available to Time Warner subscribers.</p>
        <p>Time Warner's promise to open its cable system to competing Internet service providers is being carefully monitored by regulators and the issue was highlighted on Thursday during Federal Communications Commissions hearings on the Time Warner-AOL merger.</p>
        <p>The merger has been criticized by NBC, the Walt Disney Company, and consumer groups, who fear that the combination could result in an unfair concentration of power.</p>
        <p>''This groundbreaking agreement underscores Time Warner Cable's commitment to offer its cable customers a choice of Internet service providers,'' said Glenn Britt, president of Time Warner Cable. He said the company would try to sign agreements with other Internet service providers .</p>
        <p>At Thursday's regulatory hearings, William E. Kennard, the F.C.C. chairman, challenged the chairman of AOL, Stephen M. Case, and the chief executive of Time Warner, Gerald M. Levin, to provide details about when the cable systems would begin carrying the services of other Internet providers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin said the company was working to open access by restructuring an agreement with Road Runner, a joint venture between Time Warner and AT&amp;T. Mr. Levin said the company was conducting technical trials of how such a system would operate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin also issued an open invitation to any Internet provider that wanted to talk to Time Warner about operating on the company's cable systems, and said that an agreement with a separate online service business was forthcoming.</p>
        <p>Time Warner Cable has more than 12.6 million customers nationwide.</p>
        <p>New York-based Juno offers both free and paid Internet access. It had three million active subscribers in March, making it the third largest provider after AOL and EarthLink.</p>
        <p>Shares in Time Warner Inc. rose $1.3125, to $76.6875, today.</p>
