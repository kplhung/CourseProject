        <p>Steven R Weisman's Editorial Observer column on exuberance at Republican National Convention in Philadelphia warns Republicans of perils of optimism; says they should heed lessons of 1948, when Gov Thomas Dewey won Republican nomination in Philadelphia and was regarded as shoo-in for president, only to be defeated by Harry S Truman (M)</p>

        <p>As they opened their four-day festival of benevolence in Philadelphia, Republicans of all stripes seemed convinced that Gov. George W. Bush's election was a sure thing in November. Yet the best possible reminder of the perils of optimism lay only a couple miles west of the First Union Center at an abandoned convention hall on the other side of the Schuylkill River.</p>
        <p>It was there in Philadelphia's massive old Municipal Auditorium that Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York captured the 1948 Republican presidential nomination, with similarly high expectations. Indeed, Meyer Berger reported in The Times that the delegates were attending ''the richest, the noisiest, the most exuberant quadrennial Republican meeting'' since losing the White House to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.</p>
        <p>By contrast, a month later in the same auditorium, President Harry Truman was given the Democratic nomination at a convention that Mr. Berger likened to a wake. The stifling heat did more than wilt emotions. When some ''doves of peace'' hidden inside a flowered liberty bell were released to signal Truman's arrival, several turned out to have died, while others menaced the delegates as Chairman Sam Rayburn shouted over the radio, ''Get those [expletive] pigeons out of here!'' It was considered just another bad omen for the party.</p>
        <p>For 52 years, of course, every underdog presidential candidate has compared himself to Truman, who defied expectations and won in November. But since 1948 was the last time Philadelphia played host to a national convention -- indeed three national conventions, including that of the Progressive Party of Henry Wallace -- echoes from that year seem particularly acute this year.</p>
        <p>According to a new book, ''The Last Campaign: How Harry Truman Won the 1948 Election,'' Philadelphia was chosen as the convention site because it sat in the center of a coaxial transmission belt enabling television to be transmitted to 500,000 sets from Richmond to Boston. In all, writes the author Zachary Karabell, 10 million viewers watched the conventions in the new medium. Democrats learned from mistakes by the Republicans and shortened their proceedings for viewers, launching a trend culminating in both parties tailoring their entire conventions for an audience that still may reach 100 million this year.</p>
        <p>The substance also reflects how much, and how little, has changed in 52 years. Dewey's capture of the Republican nomination came at the height of the hegemony of the party's so-called liberal Eastern establishment. By the 1960's, control of the party shifted south, along with the Bush family. George Bush moved to Texas out of the shadow of his father, Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut, but he was always seen as a son of that establishment. Now Governor Bush, like his father, proclaims himself a man of the Sunbelt, but acts like an internationalist in the Dewey-Eisenhower tradition.</p>
        <p>Despite the pigeon problem, Truman went on to give a great acceptance speech in Philadelphia that launched his historic come-from-behind victory. What is striking about it is how little the issues have changed. Truman outlined them as Social Security, education, health, the minimum wage and avoiding tax cuts for the rich in order to pay down the national debt.</p>
        <p>The Truman style will be hard to replicate, however. Like Vice President Al Gore in this year's campaign, Truman bragged endlessly on how prosperous farmers and workers had become under the Democrats. But somehow it is hard to imagine Mr. Gore issuing Truman's salty warning to both that ''they are the most ungrateful people in the world if they pass the Democratic Party by this year.''</p>
        <p>At the end of their sweltering convention, drenched and wilted Republicans left town convinced they had a winner but feeling somehow uninspired. Dewey, said the Nation magazine, was ''the nominee nobody loves.'' This year, judging from the reaction of delegates in Philadelphia, that is one thing that is strikingly different. But of course Governor Bush is beloved most of all because he looks like a sure winner. From the delegates' perspective, the presumptive nominee's strategy of staging a streamlined convention with plenty of uplifting talk and pictures of a more diverse Republican Party looks like a winner, too.</p>
        <p>But in the padlocked auditorium across the river, there may be a few ghosts who remember the lesson of 1948. Dewey regarded the convention as the culmination of his effort, rather than as a mere beginning, leaving himself vulnerable to a pugnacious Democrat who refused to believe the polls.</p>
