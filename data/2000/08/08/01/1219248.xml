        <p>For much of the last decade, Russia's government had promised that it would reduce the country's huge tax burden. Last week it finally did. But the changes, business owners say, do not go nearly far enough.</p>
        <p>Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, businesses have been plagued by a tax system so complicated and burdensome that most have chosen to keep big chunks of their revenue hidden. Armies of bureaucrats, many of them prone to bribery, make operating even more expensive and turn company accountants into tax negotiators. Even losses are taxed, while slender profits can turn into losses after taxes.</p>
        <p>The overhaul of the Russian tax code aims to drag enormous portions of revenue out of hiding and onto company books by reducing the tax burden about 20 percent.</p>
        <p>But many businesses, which pay only a fraction of what they really owe, say that only deeper cuts and a fairer system will induce them to pay.</p>
        <p>A payroll tax is considered one of the biggest drags on business. Oleg Ryabov, who owns a small blouse-maker with about 50 employees in northern Moscow, says the deepest cuts in the new tax code passed over him. His seamstresses earn an average of 5,000 rubles a month, or $180, more than double the country's average wage. Still, that is well below the level at which sharp reductions in the payroll tax apply. Mr. Ryabov's business is eligible for a tax cut of only two percentage points. He said he would continue, as before, to show only a third of his workers' wages to the tax authorities.</p>
        <p>In all, about 15 percent of Russians' wages are eligible for the deepest cuts.</p>
        <p>''Now if we pay what we owe, we just cannot compete,'' said Mr. Ryabov, 39, whose small company is tucked away in the back of a former machinery factory.</p>
        <p>The company pays about one-sixth of what it really owes in taxes. Any more would make his blouses more expensive than the Chinese imports at Moscow's biggest outdoor markets. Importers of such garments often avoid paying tariffs, and the imports come to the consumer virtually tax-free.</p>
        <p>Larger businesses have a harder time trimming officially reported wages and revenue. One of Russia's biggest cosmetics producers, Kalina, says it cannot get away with hiding revenue. It welcomed the tax changes, in particular a flat-rate income tax reduction to 13 percent from a maximum of 35 percent. The company, which employs about 2,500 people, will have to withhold far less from workers' wages.</p>
        <p>''When I say we pay taxes, people look at me as if I am crazy,'' said Aleksandr Petrov, finance director at Kalina, in the Ural Mountains.</p>
        <p>The company is languishing in wait for long-delayed changes in taxes on profits, which the government is to begin wrestling with in the fall. Current laws allow it few write-offs for business expenses. For example, only 0.5 percent of advertising expenses can be deducted, while write-offs for aging equipment must be spread over 25 years, reducing the tax benefit.</p>
        <p>Still, the tax changes so far have been welcomed by many Russians as a good start. They allow the poorest people for the first time to take additional write-offs for education and health care, and reduce the revenue tax, until now 4 percent of company income, to 1 percent.</p>
        <p>The Russian industrialist Kakha Bendukidze, who heads Uralmash, a big machinery producer, called on President Vladimir V. Putin at a meeting last Friday to further reduce tax rates. High taxes are the single biggest hindrance to doing business in Russia, he said. ''Until the tax rates are lowered, every businessman is a criminal,'' Mr. Bendukidze said after the meeting.</p>
        <p>The government has promised more cuts in 2002 and 2003.</p>
