        <p>Fred Tepper grew increasingly voluble as he described the wonders of Project: Messiah, the character animation software that he was promoting at Siggraph, the leading annual conclave for specialists in computer graphics, virtual reality and interactive technologies.</p>
        <p>''Since the beginning of time in computer animation, people have been looking for more realistic characters,'' Mr. Tepper said. ''And we're finally getting there.''</p>
        <p>This was the first convention for the company behind Project: Messiah, pmG -- basically a bunch of friends and colleagues with backgrounds in computer animation. And here they were at Siggraph, with their own booth, their own line of products -- right in there with the big guys .</p>
        <p>''We don't really have a company headquarters yet,'' Mr. Tepper said. ''Basically, at the moment, we're kind of all working out of our houses.''</p>
        <p>As computer graphics become increasingly important in the production and distribution of popular entertainment in America -- whether it's three-dimensional animation or photo-realistic special effects -- an argument can be made that the best way to see into the culture's future is not to take in the latest Off Broadway sensation or study the works of the current darling of the Iowa Writers' Workshop, but to stroll around at Siggraph, ground zero in the digital entertainment explosion.</p>
        <p>What would rapidly become apparent on such a stroll is that several converging forces are at work that in the very near future are likely to result in more plentiful, vivid and immersive entertainment, whether it's in a movie theater, in front of a computer screen or seated at a video game console.</p>
        <p>''We're moving into a period of what I call lean-forward entertainment, as oppose to lean-back entertainment,'' said Fred Angelopoulos, chief executive of Pulse Entertainment. ''I am talking about entertainment that doesn't allow you to sit back, that pulls you right into it.''</p>
        <p>Using software that has just arrived on the market, animators will be able to work more quickly and much, much more cheaply. Home hobbyists and aspiring filmmakers will be able to create, on personal computers no more powerful than the ones they probably already have in their homes, special effects and animations of astonishing sophistication. In addition, new methods in what is called image-based rendering are emerging to make it easier to create animation from photographs and other digital images scanned into a computer.</p>
        <p>On the World Wide Web, three-dimensional animation will become increasingly the norm, for shopping, for gaming, for attracting people to Internet sites and keeping them there. New affiliations like those just announced between Intel and Macromedia and between Real Networks and Pulse Entertainment indicate that the science of compressing huge volumes of data may finally make it possible to stream complex three-dimensional images into personal computers.</p>
        <p>Technologies like haptics, which makes virtual objects on a computer or game screen ''feel'' as though they are real by adding tension and vibrations to a mouse or joystick, will intensify the online experience. And with a new generation of powerful video-game machines like Sony's Power Station 2 and Microsoft's X-box, the richness and realism of game animations will take a quantum leap forward.</p>
        <p>''The biggest difference we will see in the coming months is in the realism,'' said Roger D. Chandler, product marketing manager for Intel's Internet Media Initiative. ''For a long time, we weren't getting that realism because the processing power wasn't there on people's desktops. But now the hardware is there. And the software is becoming available to utilize it.''</p>
        <p>Siggraph was founded by the Association for Computer Machinery and stands for Special Interest Group -- Graphics, a name given to the show three decades ago, when the field was dominated by those providing computer-enhanced applications for the military and industry. Gradually, those innovations made their way into commercial use and then into popular entertainment. Now, Hollywood and computer games are the dominant flavor at the annual event.</p>
        <p>The trade floor, where the latest high-tech gizmos are unveiled, is as big as the deck of an aircraft carrier, a labyrinthine grid of blinking lights, overhead screens, twirling logos and cacophonous pitches. Many companies use the event to introduce their latest products, like Sony's Gscube, a video graphics equalizer that allows animators to create complex scenes in real time. (Until recently, animators had to punch in volumes of computer code -- for characters, for textures, for movements -- and then let it process for hours, or even overnight, before seeing how the result looked.)</p>
        <p>Since Hollywood has become so central to the computer graphics industry, Siggraph is held every other year in Los Angeles, where it has attracted around 45,000 people in recent years. In the alternate years, the conclave shifts to places like Orlando, Washington and, this year, New Orleans, and the crowds are generally smaller, around 25,000 to 35,000.</p>
        <p>The event is the largest get-together of the year for those involved in the field, a time when college friendships are renewed and resumes are passed around with zeal. Job seekers formed long lines to apply to the leading animation companies -- Disney, Pixar Animation (creators of ''Toy Story''), Pacific Data Images (''Antz''), Sony Imageworks (''Stuart Little''), Blue Sky Productions (making the forthcoming ''Ice Age''), Square Films (making ''Final Fantasy'') -- and the top effects houses, like Industrial Light and Magic, Digital Domain, Mantex and Rhythm and Hues.</p>
        <p>It is a young field, and the bulk of those attending the event are also young -- certainly under 40, many of them fresh out of college. And, as might be expected when so many young people are gathered together, there is a certain party atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Bulletin boards set up around the convention center were festooned with graffiti (''I Love New Orleans!'') promoting parties and Web sites and all-night raves. Each evening offered an array of company-sponsored parties at French Quarter nightclubs and uptown mansions, many of which lasted until near dawn and brought a certain bleary aspect to the early morning reading of technical papers.</p>
        <p>Siggraph also has a high-art component, a digital art gallery, at which serious artists can display work built upon computer-created images or effects. The results this year ranged from the eerily beautiful to the perplexing and the whimsical.</p>
        <p>In ''Free Range Appliances,'' a corral full of toasters, eggbeaters and other small household items, all mounted on wheels, would spring to life when flashlights were shined on them.</p>
        <p>In a piece called ''Nosce Te Ipsum'' by a University of Michigan artist named Tiffany Holmes, viewers were asked to walk along a path toward a screen displaying a collage of images. As the viewer got closer to the screen, pieces of it were torn away, to the amplified sound of ripping paper, until finally a video image of the viewer appeared on the screen, gaping back at himself.</p>
        <p>In a nearby room called the Studio, visitors could create their own paintings and sculptures using the kind of high-end equipment and software most of them never have a chance to use. And upstairs in the convention center, in dozens of meetings room, classes in computer techniques and theory ran throughout the five-day gathering. Four auditoriums showed a rotating program of 135 pieces of computer animation, chosen from more than 600 submitted from all over the world.</p>
        <p>Almost everywhere, the talk was about breaking through boundaries to make the entertainment experience more vivid, and about how inexpensive the whole field is becoming.</p>
        <p>Project: Messiah began as a plug-in to one of the dominant animation packages, a common first step for animation software. A studio will equip its staff with an animation package -- Maya, Softimage and Houdini are among the bigger names -- and then buy individual plug-ins that enhance a particular feature. Such a plug-in might, for example, offer heightened facial animation capabilities or a range of arcane textures.</p>
        <p>Eventually, many of the plug-in companies move beyond that stage and offer a stand-alone version, a soup-to-nuts animation package, which is what Messiah was doing this year. The first Project: Messiah stand-alone was selling for $395 at the convention.</p>
        <p>''There is a huge home hobby thing going on right now,'' Mr. Tepper said. ''I can remember when I was in high school and wanted to make movies, I got a Super-8 camera. Well, this is sort of the Super-8 camera of the new millennium.''</p>
        <p>And Messiah was far from alone; more than a dozen software companies were offering animation packages and plug-ins that cost well under $1,000 and promised sophisticated results, even on a home computer.</p>
        <p>Bill Riley, the vice president for marketing and business development at Face2Face, said that his company's software, which turns flat images into three-dimensional ones, is aimed at creating more sophisticated facial animation. At the moment, the company is offering the product to animation studios, estimating it will save 25 percent in time and costs.</p>
        <p>''Eventually, we are hoping to move into animation in the house,'' he said. ''Maybe creating the next generation of greeting cards, where people can scan images of themselves into their computer and then create animated versions of themselves to send over the Internet as Christmas or birthday cards.''</p>
        <p>The savings were not limited to at-home animation. Scott Ross, chairman of Digital Domain, said he had seen the cost of equipping one of his company's effects animators plummet from his early days in the business, when he created effects for films like ''The Abyss'' (1986).</p>
        <p>''Not to geek out on you,'' he said, ''but back in 1986 a standard work station cost $65,000, plus $34,000 for the software. So you were looking at a cost of about $100,000 per seat. Now, you can get 10 times the power in a $7,000 computer.''</p>
        <p>In the convention's technical areas, where academic researchers offered technical papers on the latest developments in the field, much of the talk was about moving beyond the current vogue in ultra-realistic animation.</p>
        <p>David Salesin, a University of Washington professor who won the convention's top prize for technical achievement, has written extensively on ways to create watercolorlike effects on the computer and to imitate the brushstrokes and the feel of impressionist paintings, moving computer animation away from the kind of rock-hard accuracy that sometimes made it feel cold and emotionless.</p>
        <p>''We've done a good job with photo-realism,'' Mr. Salesin said. ''Now is the time to look at more expressive forms of drawing.''</p>
