        <p>''Is it a real disease?'' is the most frequently asked question about fibromyalgia, an ailment characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain.

        <p>Not so, say experts who have spent years studying this controversial disorder. Yes, some people with fibromyalgia may be depressed or anxious, but wouldn't you be if you couldn't carry a bag of groceries, walk through a park or tie your shoelaces without considerable pain?</p>

        <p>''Is it a real disease?'' is the most frequently asked question about fibromyalgia, an ailment characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain. The cynical tone that usually accompanies the question suggests that many think this syndrome is all in a person's head, the result, perhaps, of an emotional disorder or an attempt to avoid the demands of work and life.</p>
        <p>Not so, say experts who have spent years studying this controversial disorder. Yes, some people with fibromyalgia may be depressed or anxious, but wouldn't you be if you couldn't carry a bag of groceries, walk through a park or tie your shoelaces without considerable pain?</p>
        <p>And yes, there is as yet no convincing physiological explanation for the array of symptoms suffered by people with fibromyalgia. It is neither an inflammatory disorder nor a degenerative disease. Its victims look perfectly normal. But when even mild pressure is applied to certain points on the body that do not normally hurt, most of those areas are painfully tender in a person with fibromyalgia.</p>
        <p>Dr. Don Goldenberg, rheumatologist at Newton-Wellesley Hospital and Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, cites studies indicating that 10 percent to 12 percent of the population suffers from persistent widespread pain, women more than men and older more than younger. Many of these people have no well-defined musculoskeletal disease but rather satisfy the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, making it the second most common diagnosis in rheumatology clinics, behind osteoarthritis.</p>
        <p>The National Institutes of Health estimates that 3.7 million Americans over 18 have fibromyalgia: about 3.4 percent of women and 0.5 percent of men and more than 7 percent of women from 60 to 79.</p>
        <p>Confusing Symptoms</p>
        <p>A decade ago, after careful study, the American College of Rheumatology concluded that chronic pain patients without some other well-defined disease who had mild or greater tenderness at 11 or more of 18 specific points on the body could be said to have fibromyalgia. But pain is only part of the problem. Patients with fibromyalgia typically also suffer from fatigue, sleep disturbances and headaches, as well as depression and anxiety.</p>
        <p>The disorder is often mistaken for osteoarthritis, which may coexist with it in the elderly. It may also be confused with degenerative spinal disk disease, a nerve entrapment syndrome or chronic Lyme disease. As with these other disorders, symptoms of fibromyalgia are often made worse by weather, stress or inappropriate exercise.</p>
        <p>Half or more of fibromyalgia patients have or once had other disorders that lack a defined organic basis, like chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic headaches or irritable bowel syndrome. This has led some to believe that fibromyalgia is a psychosomatic disorder, an emotional problem that manifests itself as a physical one. But while half or more of people with fibromyalgia have a history of depression, most have no current psychiatric illness.</p>
        <p>Certain organic aberrations have been found in people with fibromyalgia, although it is not yet known if these came before or after the syndrome developed. Among them are changes in nervous system chemicals that may explain the common problem of disturbed sleep. Fibromyalgia patients typically lack restorative, or slow-wave, sleep, which can result in chronic fatigue and heightened sensitivity. Levels of substance P, a chemical related to pain, and some abnormal pain-related peptides are at high levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of fibromyalgia patients, who may also have insufficient blood flow to parts of the brain involved in pain perception.</p>
        <p>Patients often report that their chronic pain is preceded by a physical or emotional trauma, like a neck injury from a car accident or loss of a job. Or the disorder may follow an infection. For example, 10 percent to 25 percent of Lyme disease patients develop fibromyalgia that persists for months or years after they have received adequate treatment for Lyme disease. These patients do not respond to prolonged treatment with antibiotics that treat Lyme disease. Despite considerable investigation, no infectious organism -- not Epstein-Barr virus or any other suspect micro-organism -- has been identified as a cause of fibromyalgia.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dennis Turk, a pain specialist at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, summed up the perplexing disorder: ''Because fibromyalgia is so confusing, other people wonder if it's real. This contributes to the sufferer's emotional distress.''</p>
        <p>Treatment, but No Cure Yet</p>
        <p>Fibromyalgia is considered a chronic problem that could last indefinitely. But proper treatment, which may involve medication to improve sleep along with a specially designed exercise program and psychological counseling, can greatly alleviate a patient's discomfort and disability.</p>
        <p>Even when patients are not depressed, studies have shown that taking low doses of an antidepressant can often treat the underlying sleep disorder and alleviate the accompanying fatigue. But experts warn against using sleeping pills, sedatives or alcohol, because these may only make the sleep problem worse.</p>
        <p>The pain and disability associated with fibromyalgia can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. As patients with pain refrain more and more from physical activity, their muscles become increasingly deconditioned and susceptible to pain from the slightest exertion.</p>
        <p>''The most important key to managing muscles affected by fibromyalgia is to keep them moving,'' says Stacie L. Bigelow, a health educator and counselor who has had fibromyalgia for nearly a decade. In her sensible and informative new book, ''Fibromyalgia: Simple Relief Through Movement,'' she likens the problem to a cement truck that must keep the cement moving to keep it from solidifying. Unused muscles become stiff and painful.</p>
        <p>The key in fibromyalgia is to increase daily activities gradually so that muscles do not remain in one position for long and to adopt a program of gentle exercise to recondition muscles, along with a stretching routine that also helps to reduce pain. Ms. Bigelow's book details ways of adopting a program of activity and exercise (alternating with rest) that, though it may not seem so at first, is essential to reducing the pain of fibromyalgia and relieving the associated disability.</p>
        <p>Another excellent book, ''Fibromyalgia and the Mind-Body-Spirit Connection'' by Dr. William B. Salt II and Dr. Edwin H. Season, describes the enormous benefits that can be gleaned from a relatively brief form of counseling called cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people address self-defeating thoughts that can aggravate pain and make adopting changes to alleviate pain difficult. If you find yourself thinking that you can never get better or that you can't stand it anymore, cognitive behavioral therapy can be very helpful.</p>
