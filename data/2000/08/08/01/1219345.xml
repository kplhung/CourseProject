        <p>Emily Brown Rosen letter says coca producers will resort to soil fumigants and fungicides to protect their crops if the fungus fusarium is used to eradicate them (July 18 article) and that this could have very serious adverse consequences</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Biological control of undesired plants is indeed a promising field of research (''Drug War Awaits Attack of Killer Fungus,'' July 18). Applications that deserve serious consideration include the removal of noxious weeds from farms and ranches and the control of nonnative plants that invade a fragile ecosystem. But there are many questions that should be answered before a virulent, persistent and broad-spectrum soil-borne disease is introduced into any environment. The effect on nontarget species is foremost among these.</p>
        <p>Those who seek to release the plant pathogenic fungus fusarium to eradicate coca in Colombia should expect as an almost certain consequence that the coca producers would resort to application of soil fumigants and fungicides to save their profitable crops.</p>
        <p>Soil-borne diseases, like the many species of fusarium that attack agricultural crops, are very difficult for farmers to control, resulting in the use of some of the most toxic materials in the agricultural arsenal, including methyl bromide and chloropicrin.</p>
        <p>Those who grow illegal crops may care little about such environmental impacts and legal restrictions on pesticides. But this could lead to the widespread use of persistent chemicals outlawed in the United States or targeted for international phase-out.</p>
        <p>This ''solution'' is shortsighted and potentially dangerous.</p>
