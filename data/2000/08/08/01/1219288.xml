        <p>The trade deadline is supposed to be for contenders. Does that mean the Chicago Cubs, who traded for Rondell White, consider themselves contenders?</p>
        <p>Only four games from first place,  the Cincinnati Reds suddenly appear to be contenders. Does that mean they blundered by trading their No. 1 starter, Denny Neagle, for four minor leaguers a few weeks ago?</p>
        <p>Why do the Atlanta Braves consistently make brilliant trades? Why were they able to extract B. J. Surhoff, a solid veteran, from Baltimore when the Yankees could not?</p>
        <p>The deadline passed at 4 p.m. yesterday so it's safe to come up for air, at least until later this month when contenders begin making waiver deals in time to make players eligible for postseason rosters. But yesterday's dizzying flurry of trades that climaxed a four-day cascade of deals was stunning.</p>
        <p>Teams made nine trades involving 29 players, outdoing Friday's flurry of activity that produced six trades involving 25 players. Adding in the weekend activity, teams traded 69 players in 20 transactions, ensuring good scorecard sales all over the country in the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>The Reds did not join the list of traders yesterday, though it was not for a lack of trying. They were part of discussions that, if concluded successfully, would have produced a four-team trade that would have plunked Pedro Astacio into the Reds' starting rotation. Astacio, whom the Yankees had also pursued, would have replaced Neagle, whom the Yankees successfully pursued.</p>
        <p>''We tried to sign Neagle and we couldn't so we traded him,'' said General Manager Jim Bowden of the Reds. ''Same with Larkin. We didn't want to get stuck with draft choices who might never play in the majors. We traded two, signed one.''</p>
        <p>Bowden referred to Barry Larkin, who was at Shea Stadium last night as the Reds' shortstop. Had he accepted the trade the teams made, he would have been the Mets' shortstop, but he didn't and instead signed a contract extension, which the Reds had said they would not give him.</p>
        <p>''We were going to sign them or trade them,'' Bowden said. He added that he was not second-guessing himself for Neagle now that the Reds had improved their playoff chances. ''We'd do it again,'' he said. ''We know we don't have to worry about free agents leaving. The same team can come back next year and play.''</p>
        <p>Bowden went after Astacio because he is signed beyond this year and could have been traded elsewhere next winter. Besides the Reds and the Colorado Rockies, the four-way trade would have included Toronto and Oakland. Presumably, in a pitcher-studded transaction, Kevin Appier would have gone from Oakland to Toronto, Chris Carpenter from Toronto to Colorado, Astacio from Colorado to Cincinnati and Scott Williamson from Cincinnati to Oakland.</p>
        <p>But that was just one of the thousands of discussions that never reached fruition. Another was the Yankees' desire to place White in left field. First they wanted him, then they were leary of a damaged knee, then they were said to have made a late bid Sunday to get him. By then, however, the Cubs had struck opportunistically. Despite the fact that the Cubs had won 15 of their previous 19 games and had leaped from 16 1/2 games from first to 8 1/2, they did not obtain White with the idea of contending for the National League Central championship.</p>
        <p>''We very much were focused on making ourselves as competitive as possible for 2001 and beyond,'' said Andy MacPhail, back in the trenches as the Cubs' acting general manager. ''While a player on the disabled list could be a risk for a contender, it's not a risk for us. We felt we had a unique opportunity to land a high-caliber player who can help us be a competitive team from 2001 forward.''</p>
        <p>The Cubs, however, did not want to take White without working out a contract extension. He rejected a four-year offer, but the Cubs exercised his 2001 option for $4 million, then agreed to a two-year, $14 million extension that White, if he has 502 plate appearances next season, can accept or reject, which would allow him to become a free agent.</p>
        <p>In last Friday trading frenzy, the Cleveland Indians, a distant second in their quest to win a sixth successive division title, turned over 20 percent of their roster in a matter of hours. The Braves, who have a solid division lead, have nevertheless created the same ratio of change in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>They traded for Andy Ashby for their starting rotation, they signed Scott Kamieniecki and Stan Belinda, who had recently been released, for their bullpen, they claimed Paul Bako to be a backup catcher and yesterday they acquired Surhoff for the outfield position that Reggie Sanders did not fill as they had expected.</p>
        <p>The Surhoff trade was just another example of the brilliant work John Schuerholz has done as the Braves' general manager. (Part of his work was not trading John Rocker to Cleveland, a deal that had been reported as having been virtually done.) The Yankees wanted Surhoff but did not satisfy the Orioles' desires or demands. The Braves did.</p>
        <p>Chances are the feelings of the Baltimore owner, Peter Angelos, toward his Yankee counterpart, George Steinbrenner, had something to do with the Orioles' decision to send Surhoff to Atlanta.</p>
        <p>The decision affects the Mets as much as it does the Yankees. Surhoff's presence in the Braves' lineup will make them tougher for the Mets to catch.</p>
