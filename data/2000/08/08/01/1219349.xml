        <p>Top executives are being named to assignments at three agencies.</p>
        <p>Dennis Donlin is becoming president of a new unit of the Starcom MediaVest Group being formed to handle the consolidated United States media planning assignment for the General Motors Corporation. The new unit, tentatively named G.M. Planworks, will be based in the Detroit area and decide where to run advertising with an annual budget estimated at $2.9 billion; G.M. selected Starcom MediaVest, part of the B Com3 Group, to handle the assignment last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donlin, 42, joins G.M. Planworks from the MediaVest Detroit unit of Starcom MediaVest in Troy, Mich., where he had been executive vice president and managing director, overseeing media planning for clients like Budd, Dow Chemical and Pulte Homes. Mr. Donlin also worked at agencies like Benton &amp; Bowles and the Bloom Agency.</p>
        <p>At the J. Walter Thompson Company in New York, part of the WPP Group, Roger Rowe was named executive vice president and worldwide creative director for the Warner-Lambert consumer group account, now part of Pfizer. Before Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert, those duties had been handled by J. J. Jordan, who left Thompson in February to start his own shop, Branding Iron in Irvington, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowe, 47, had been president at NetWerks in New York, a marketing consulting company, after leaving the New York office of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, where he had been executive vice president and executive director.</p>
        <p>While at Saatchi, he worked on accounts like Burger King, Delta Air Lines and Tylenol.</p>
        <p>And Jack Rooney is taking the new post of senior partner and executive group director at the Chicago office of Ogilvy &amp; Mather North America, part of the Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide unit of WPP.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rooney, 42, will oversee the agency's new BP Amoco account.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rooney had most recently been vice president for marketing at Guild.com in Madison, Wis., which sells art over the Internet. His posts before that included vice president for marketing at the Miller Brewing Company unit of Philip Morris, managing director at the San Francisco office of Leagas Delaney and worldwide account director on the Levi Strauss account at the San Francisco office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications.</p>
