        <p>The Giants are gambling at a variety of spots in their revamped starting lineup, hoping they have the right player at the right post. From the offensive line to the defensive line to cornerback, the Giants are taking risks.</p>
        <p>Of all these gambles, the least risky seems to be at free safety, where Shaun Williams was anointed the starter.</p>
        <p>Williams, the team's first-round pick two years ago, has never started a National Football League game. If the Giants are gambling at free safety, it is behind Williams, where the team has no experienced backup.</p>
        <p>Today, Williams was moving around training camp on crutches, with his foot immobilized in a soft boot that covers his lower leg.</p>
        <p>All bets are off.</p>
        <p>Williams sprained his left big toe on the first play in Saturday's scrimmage and will miss at least two weeks. Coach Jim Fassel did not predict when Williams would return. Williams, who missed several weeks with hamstring strains in each of the last two seasons, said the team doctors would not give him a timetable, either.</p>
        <p>''Well, this injury can be tricky,'' said Fassel, adding that X-rays of Williams's toe were negative. ''You don't know. With a sprained toe, some guys are out a long while, some guys it's a week or two.''</p>
        <p>Fassel did not specify which category fits Williams. Neither did he bring up Deion Sanders, who missed six games with a sprained toe in 1998. But the coach did say that Williams will miss Saturday's preseason game against Chicago.</p>
        <p>Starting in place of Williams, and perhaps for another month, will be Lyle West, whose N.F.L. experience is limited to six games last year -- almost exclusively on special teams. West was the Giants' surprise sixth-round draft selection last year from San Jose State.</p>
        <p>As a rookie, West, 23, did not distinguish himself. On the final play of the last preseason game against the Ravens, he misplayed a pass -- going for an interception and failing to make a tackle -- that led to a quirky touchdown, turning a certain victory into a disheartening defeat. In November, he was suspended for four games for violating the N.F.L.'s substance-abuse policy. West finished the season with four tackles on special teams.</p>
        <p>West said an anti-inflammatory prescription medicine he had received from his physician to treat a strained hamstring had contained an anabolic steroid. West said his mistake was not clearing the prescription with the league before taking it.</p>
        <p>''Lyle is making strides,'' Fassel said. ''He has a long way to go, but he's going to get his chance to step up. In terms of experience we're thin in a couple spots, and yeah, I'm a little nervous since that's one of them.''</p>
        <p>Currently, the third safety is Tinker Keck, a rookie free agent from the University of Cincinnati. Should Williams's injury linger into late August, expect the Giants to pursue a veteran when teams trim their rosters. If the Giants lose Williams for any extended period of time, it will be a significant setback to the secondary. Already, the Giants have a new left cornerback in Dave Thomas, who has not started in the league for two years. Thomas, at 6 feet 3 inches and 218 pounds, is known more for his physical play and tackling ability than for his cover skills.</p>
        <p>Thomas, more than right cornerback Jason Sehorn, may need deep help from a fleet free safety, like Williams. Today, Williams seemed understandably depressed about his injury.</p>
        <p>''Somebody landed on the back of my foot, and I kind of hyperextended my toe,'' Williams said. ''I was hoping it would go away, but it kept hurting. It's upsetting because I finally get a chance to start. Now I can't run and I can't even ride a stationary bike to stay in shape. I just have to rest it.''</p>
        <p>West, however, said he was looking forward to Saturday's game.</p>
        <p>''I know the defense a lot better than I did a year ago,'' he said. ''Certainly, I feel a lot more comfortable.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>MICHAEL STRAHAN left camp Monday to visit a Manhattan back specialist and a chiropractor. Coach JIM FASSEL said that Strahan was not seriously injured and that the defensive lineman should play Saturday. ''I am going to be cautious with him,'' Fassel said. But he needs to get practicing.'' But Fassel said that Strahan would not practice on Tuesday. . . . Running back JOE MONTGOMERY wore a red jersey in practice to tell defensive players that he should not be hit. Red jerseys are usually worn by quarterbacks. Fassel said Montgomery has a deep cut inside his mouth. . . . Running back SEAN BENNETT returned after missing last week's workouts because of a back problem.</p>
