        <p>In the early 1840's, as a whaling seaman not yet embarked on his prodigious literary career, Herman Melville read Owen Chase's ''Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex.'' Later he wrote in his own copy of the ''Narrative'': ''The reading of this wondrous story upon the landless sea, &amp; close to the very latitude of the shipwreck had a surprising effect on me.''</p>
        <p>The surprising effect was to give Melville the inspiration for the ending of ''Moby-Dick,'' the sinking, or ''the stoving,'' of the Pequod by the white whale. In the fictionalized version there is only one survivor, Ishmael. In the case of the Essex the 20-man crew lived through the attack, but in the long, disastrous voyage that followed, 12 of them died, some cannibalized by their shipmates.</p>
        <p>The sinking of the Essex and the aftermath are brought viscerally to life in Nathaniel Philbrick's ''In the Heart of the Sea,'' which begins where ''Moby-Dick'' ends.</p>
        <p>''The Essex was absolutely crucial to Melville's conception of the novel,'' Mr. Philbrick said during a recent visit to New York from his home in Nantucket, Mass. ''A book that we think of as such a discursive wandering into the imagination has a ballast of real fact that was very important to Melville. This could happen. This did happen. That's what my book is about.''</p>
        <p>Almost every year there are new books dealing with aspects of Melville, and adaptations of his work onstage, in films or on television. ''Melville is in the air,'' said Mr. Philbrick, who has hit the crest of that wave. His book is both a critical success and an international best seller. For a time it was first on best-seller lists in London and Dublin.</p>
        <p>Recognizing the increasing interest in Melville, Hershel Parker, who is completing the second volume of his monumental biography of the author, attributed it partly to ''a general desire to be stirred, moved, exalted, ennobled by what we read,'' in particular by Melville's mythic voyages.  ''The boom is not over by any means,'' he said. ''Only in recent years has Melville entered the national consciousness beyond 'Moby-Dick.' ''</p>
        <p>Led by books like ''In the Heart of the Sea,'' he added, ''We are ready to look at Melville as a participant in one of the great American adventures: the whaling industry.''</p>
        <p>In addition to ''In the Heart of the Sea,'' Elizabeth Hardwick's ''Herman Melville,'' an intense psychosexual analysis of the author's art in the Penguin series of brief lives of famous people, and Tim Severin's personalized expedition, ''In Search of Moby Dick: The Quest for the White Whale,'' have recently been published.</p>
        <p>Rinde Eckert's ''And God Created Great Whales,'' a bold experimental musical starring Mr. Eckert as a composer attempting to write an operatic version of ''Moby-Dick,'' had a brief run at Dance Theater Workshop in June and is scheduled to reopen next month off Broadway. For the show Mr. Eckert has written -- and sings -- several songs that have the power of the novel.</p>
        <p>In the works is ''Melville's World,'' a book by Andrew Delbanco that will be an ''effort to see the world Melville lived in through his eyes'' and his ''incredibly penetrating intelligence.'' Mr. Delbanco, an author and critic who has been teaching Melville for more than 20 years, plans to deal in the book with the novelist's ''response to the Civil War, industrialization, human sexuality and changes in race and religion in America.''</p>
        <p>The fascination with Melville begins, of course, with ''Moby-Dick.'' In 1850 Melville moved from Manhattan to Pittsfield, Mass., where he bought a farm he named Arrowhead. Two important things happened while he was there. He met Nathaniel Hawthorne, who became his friend and mentor, and, looking out the window of his study toward the whalelike Mount Greylock, he completed ''Moby-Dick'' and dedicated it to Hawthorne.</p>
        <p>When his masterwork was published in 1851, Melville was only 32 and already the author of five novels, beginning with ''Typee'' and ''Omoo,'' popular adventure stories based on his life at sea. Readers apparently had hoped for another ''Typee'' and were not prepared for a daring metaphorical exploration of a man's obsession with good and evil and his monomaniacal act of vengeance. The book was unappreciated and sold few copies, in contrast to Hawthorne's ''Scarlet Letter,'' which was published the previous year.</p>
        <p>Melville immediately followed ''Moby-Dick'' with the obdurate ''Pierre: or the Ambiguities'' and became increasingly bitter at his lack of success. He also felt abandoned when Hawthorne moved from the Berkshires to Concord, Mass. During the last two decades of his life, Melville worked as a clerk in the Customs House in Manhattan and gave up writing fiction, more or less becoming a real-life counterpart to the passive clerk he wrote about in ''Bartleby the Scrivener.'' During this time he was writing his epic poem, ''Clarel.''</p>
        <p>Long after the author's death, ''Moby-Dick'' was rediscovered and became the foundation of his career and of American literature itself. Acknowledging the book's neglect in the author's lifetime, the English critic James Wood says: ''Melville wrote the novel that is every writer's dream of freedom. It is as if he painted a patch of blue sky for the imprisoned.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Philbrick, a former sailing journalist who has written several books about Nantucket and is himself an expert on Melville, calls ''Moby-Dick'' ''the most profound book about America, whaling -- and the world.''</p>
        <p>He got the idea for ''In the Heart of the Sea,'' he said, while cruising with his wife and children on a ship off the coast of Maine. It was the summer of 1997 -- of ''The Perfect Storm'' and ''Into the Air'' and the movie ''Titanic.'' These were, he said, ''survival stories, and the ultimate survival story'' was the Essex. ''It's a piece of American history,'' he said. ''Before the Donner Party, there was the Essex disaster.''</p>
        <p>His father, Thomas Philbrick, a professor of English, had told the story of the Essex to him and his brother when they were children, and diverse books had been written about it. Mr. Philbrick was just finishing a book about the ''Native American legacy on Nantucket,'' he said, and the epilogue referred to the Essex, ''tying it in with Melville's mythmaking.''</p>
        <p>He wondered if the story could be approached in a new way, profiting from contemporary information about areas like oceanography and starvation. He gathered books and other documents into what he described as his war room. While writing the book he took a leave from his position as director of the Egan Institute of Maritime Studies on Nantucket.</p>
        <p>Drawing upon Chase's ''Narrative'' and Thomas Nickerson's ''Desultory Sketches,'' a first-person account by the cabin boy on the Essex, he weighed one report against the other. It was from Nickerson's monograph that he learned that Chase, the first mate, had an opportunity to lance the whale after its first attack but decided not to take the chance. The two narratives and other first-person accounts were recently published in a book, ''The Loss of the Ship Essex, Sunk by a Whale,'' edited by Mr. Philbrick and his father.</p>
        <p>The tragic paradox of the Essex was that the captain, George Pollard, recommended that they head for Tahiti instead of remaining at sea, but the crew was fearful of encountering cannibals and overruled him. As Melville wrote in his annotations in his copy of Chase's ''Narrative'': ''All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex might, in all human probability, have been avoided had they immediately after leaving the wreck, steered straight for Tahiti, from which they were not very distant at the time. But they dreaded cannibals.'' Melville knew that missionaries had been on the island and that it was safe.</p>
        <p>''In the Heart of the Sea,'' published by Viking, is also about Nantucket, the port from which the Essex and the Pequod sailed. At the time, the early 1800's, the island's economy centered on whaling. Young men signed on for periods of two or three years. After several trips they could afford to retire. There was, Mr. Philbrick said, a ''brotherhood of workers'' on whaling ships. At the same time, in his book, he contemplates the fact that none of the African-American seamen survived the Essex disaster.</p>
        <p>Although Melville had not been on Nantucket before he wrote ''Moby-Dick,'' he was able to give a knowledgeable history of the island and he also borrowed many local names for his characters. In his first visit, after the novel was published, he met Captain Pollard, who was then working as a night watchman. He was, Melville wrote, ''the most impressive man, tho' wholly unassuming, even humble -- that I ever encountered.''</p>
        <p>Pollard, Mr. Philbrick learned, was a ''short, fat, jolly man who loved the good things in life but fasted every Nov. 20 in memory of the Essex survivors.'' He believes that in many ways Pollard, in his adjustment to the tragedy, was like Ishmael, and that Chase was like Ahab, haunted forever by his experiences at sea.</p>
        <p>''I think Melville identified very strongly with Pollard,'' Mr. Philbrick said. In a sense both their careers were ''sunk by a whale.'' He said that while writing his book he was keenly aware of Melville's looking over his shoulder. ''I'd see him walking the streets of Nantucket at night, waving at me,'' he joked,</p>
        <p>As for the title, he said he had looked up the word sea in a biblical concordance and found ''in the heart of the sea'' in Exodus. Explaining his interest, he said that he regarded the sea as ''a frontier that was never civilized.'' He continued: ''You go to the west and there are cities and railroads. You go to the sea and we can pollute it all we want but it's still out there. It's as close to an eternal frontier as we're going to get. There's nothing better than the sea in ridding you of the illusion of mastery,'' as man is forced to battle elemental forces beyond his control.</p>
        <p>''The more I got into the Essex disaster,'' he said, ''the more it seemed that in 'Moby-Dick' there is a deep secret, a darkness lurking. I really feel that's informed by the survival and the suffering of the men of the Essex.'' He added, ''I remain impressed with the dignity, stoicism and discipline of the Essex crew'' throughout their ordeal.</p>
        <p>In tribute to Melville he ends his book by recalling a scene from ''Moby-Dick'' in which Ishmael sees a reconstructed skeleton of a whale and realizes how ''vain and foolish'' it is to try to comprehend such a creature by studying its remains. Melville concludes, ''Only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Philbrick suggests that after ''all hope, passion and force of will have been expended, the bones may be all that are left'' -- except, of course, for books like ''Moby-Dick'' and ''In the Heart of the Sea.''</p>
