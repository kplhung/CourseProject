        <p>One does not find them on Savile Row or the Faubourg St.-Honore. They do not clang down at night along Rodeo Drive or Madison Avenue. And while 34th Street in Manhattan is hardly one of the world's grand window-shopping destinations, if some had their way, solid metal security gates would be just as unthinkable there.</p>
        <p>After years of trying to rid the newly spruced-up shopping corridor of these unsightly gates, Daniel A.  Biederman, the president of the 34th Street Partnership, thought he had a proposal to sway even the most stubborn merchant.</p>
        <p>His organization, a business improvement district, offered to absorb the $1,500 to $2,000 cost of replacing the old gates with see-through latticed metal gates that are found in upscale shopping areas. The partnership would also oversee the work and make sure that sales were not interrupted during the changeover.</p>
        <p>Some of the merchants approached by the business group saw this as a good deal.</p>
        <p>''They're making it free, so I'll try it,'' said Julie Kim, the manager of Cliquer's, a clothing store that sells gowns for $21.99 and gauzy flowered skirts for $9.99.</p>
        <p>But much to Mr. Biederman's surprise and disappointment, Mrs. Kim's response was not typical. Of the 11 stores that the organization went after, all between Fifth and Seventh Avenues, more than half said no. ''It's been a long, frustrating path,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many people in retailing believe  solid gates actually invite crime by giving a block a disheveled, uncared-for appearance. ''Counter to what people think,'' Mr. Biederman said, ''they don't need to be used in valuable storefronts because, in general, they're not used on Madison Avenue.''</p>
        <p>Solid gates also attract graffiti, although Mr. Biederman said that  had not been much of a problem on heavily traveled 34th Street in recent years.</p>
        <p>Even the most disoriented tourist is not likely to confuse 34th Street with Madison Avenue, but these days it is home to a number of national chains, including Banana Republic, Skechers and Old Navy, all of which use see-through gates to invite night-time window shoppers.</p>
        <p>More stores are coming. A Sephora cosmetics store and an H &amp; M clothing store are under construction. Annual rents, which stood at $100 a square foot not too long ago, have climbed to $150 or more, said Dan Pisark, a vice president of the partnership.</p>
        <p>As the partnership sees it, the dispute represents something of a clash of cultures between the large chains with the latest merchandising techniques and smaller stores that give character to the street but are badly in need of updating.</p>
        <p>At Herald House of Leather, one of the stores that rejected the business group's offer, the manager, James Lee, said gates had to be considered case by case. What might work for the low-priced shoe store next door would not work for him, he said, because his merchandise is more valuable, and therefore more vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Pointing to the $500 caramel-colored leather jackets in his window, he said his store was frequently plagued with shoplifters despite its security guard and alarm system. He said a see-through gate would only increase the risk.</p>
        <p>''You remember the blackout?'' Mr. Lee asked. Hundreds of stores were looted in July 1977 when the city went dark for as long as 25 hours in some places. ''At that time, see-through gates were mostly the target. My merchandise, some people want to steal it too much.''</p>
        <p>Record Explosion, a cluttered store that has hand-lettered signs in its windows -- also unthinkable, as far as the partnership is concerned -- is another holdout. The owner, who spoke only on the condition that his name not be published, said a change was not needed because his gates protected his store when no one was there.</p>
        <p>''I'm not looking for a headache,'' he said. ''I'm happy with what I have.''</p>
        <p>Le Chateau, a trendy clothing store near the Empire State Building, dumped its solid gate in favor of a see-through gate about 18 months ago under an earlier partnership program that required merchants to pay half the costs.</p>
        <p>Dino Nifakos, the director of store design at the company's headquarters in Montreal, said the results had been very good. ''We're happy,'' he said. ''We notice that people stop and look into the stores. We were concerned a bit about vandalism, but we haven't experienced any so far.''</p>
        <p>Just last week, three men's wear  stores on 34th Street -- two of them operating under the name Porta Bella and one called Fino -- accepted the partnership's offer and will replace their solid gates soon. ''They are looking to improve the street,'' said Karl Ashmawy, the manager of the stores. ''The see-through gates will give us more cosmetic enhancement, more of an open look. If we could make 34th Street look more like Fifth Avenue, it would be a real plus.''</p>
