        <p>China today sentenced a former central government official to death for taking almost $5 million in bribes, the highest-profile case yet in the country's marathon anticorruption drive.</p>
        <p>The former official, Cheng Kejie, who until April was one of 19 vice chairmen of the National People's Congress under its chief, Li Peng, would be the most senior Chinese official executed for corruption since 1949, when the Communists took control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheng was found guilty of taking bribes while he ran the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, a poor, mountainous province bordering Vietnam and populated largely by ethnic minorities, including the Zhuang people. Mr. Cheng is a Zhuang, China's largest ethnic group after Han Chinese.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheng, 67, has 10 days to appeal his sentence, but such appeals are rarely successful. On March 8, the former vice governor of Jiangxi Province was executed for corruption almost immediately after losing his appeal. Executions in China are carried out by pistol shot to the back of the head.</p>
        <p>The anticorruption drive, which has been in operation for two years, is the Communist Party's latest effort to shore up its credibility as its ideological foundations crumble; the party embraces -- albeit reluctantly -- market economics; and the country's best and brightest abandon Marxism to make money.</p>
        <p>The hybrid economy, in which the state owns most assets but is relaxing control over how those assets are used, has given officials huge opportunities for graft. Many economists believe that corruption is unbeatable as long as the system gives officials the use of state assets without making them responsible for those assets' economic viability.</p>
        <p>''The problem can't be solved by just punishing some people,'' said He Qinglian, an independent economist and outspoken social critic, ''because this system itself breeds corruption.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Cheng's case, he and his mistress amassed $4.7 million, primarily from kickbacks on land deals and in return for granting development contracts between 1992 and 1998. There is no open bidding process for such transactions and officials like Mr. Cheng have the power to dole out land rights or development contracts as they see fit.</p>
        <p>Many Chinese are cynical about the party's drive against corruption, which is seen as selective because graft is so endemic that many cases involve party officials with central government protection. China's media, for example, are forbidden to investigate anything more than petty consumer-related corruption cases. Newspapers are regularly told not to write about even well-known corruption cases, or told to limit coverage to dispatches from the central government's New China News Agency.</p>
        <p>Ms. He advocates giving the media freer rein in investigating corruption and allowing nongovernmental organizations to act as watchdogs. Otherwise, the government will never successfully root out corruption from within its own ranks, she argues.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Communist Party has tightened control of the media and punished people like Ms. He, who was recently demoted.</p>
        <p>There has been almost no state media coverage, for example, of the country's biggest ongoing corruption case, which centers on the smuggling of hundreds of millions of dollars in firearms, cars and crude oil through the southeastern port of Xiamen. The case has reportedly implicated 200 people, including Xiamen police officers, bankers and customs agents, and the former wife of a Communist Party Politburo member. She has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>According to widespread rumors, the case also implicates Gen. Ji Shengde, the former head of the army's intelligence department and the son of one of China's most vaunted revolutionary leaders.</p>
        <p>General Ji was identified by a Chinese-American businessman, Johnny Chung, as the source of funds used for donations to the United States' Democratic National Committee in 1996. But, as with much unofficial news about China, the reports that General Ji has been arrested and is awaiting trial come from the Hong Kong media, which often rely on unsubstantiated rumor from the mainland.</p>
