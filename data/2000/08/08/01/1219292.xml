        <p>INDIA: TOP ACTOR KIDNAPPED  Rajkumar, one of southern India's best-known movie stars, left, has been kidnapped by Veerappan, one of India's most notorious criminals, the police said. The actor, who is active in politics, was abducted from his farmhouse in Gajanur village in the state of Tamil Nadu, along with his son-in-law and two other men. The police said Mr. Veerappan, who has kidnapped other people, usually for ransom, had threatened the actor. The kidnappers left an audio cassette with the family, saying a government representative should contact the gang's mediator for demands.</p>

        <p>LAOS: BOMB BLAST  Witnesses said several people were injured in an explosion at the main post office in the capital city, Vientiane, apparently the latest in a series of unexplained bombings. The explosion came one day after witnesses said a suspected bomb was removed from the departure lounge of Vientiane's domestic air terminal.</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: MYSTERIOUS WAYS  God has brought a historic drought upon the nation because of people's neglect of their religious duties and their ingratitude toward the ruling Taliban, the militia's supreme leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, said in an announcement quoted in the official daily Heywad. It was a rare admission of any public discontent with the Taliban.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: STEP CLOSER TO SUHARTO TRIAL  Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said recent medical tests show that former President Suharto is fit to stand trial on charges of corruption during his 32-year rule. He said a case would be filed soon at a district court in the capital, Jakarta.</p>

        <p>KASHMIR: PEACE SETBACK  Six Indian soldiers were killed in a daring raid on a military compound, marring hopes for peace at a time when a major militant group, the Hizbul Mujahideen, has ordered a cease-fire against Indian forces. Another militant organization, Lashker-I-Toiba, claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was in retaliation for the peace gesture, according to the Press Trust of India news service.</p>

        <p>IRAN: EDITOR SENTENCED  Mohammad Reza Zohdi, editor of the banned reformist newspaper Arya, was sentenced to a four-month jail term and an unspecified cash fine for ''insulting officials and government organizations'' and ''disturbing public opinion,'' an official paper reported. Iranian hard-liners, who have waged a war against President Mohammad Khatami's democratic reforms, have used similar charges to close down 20 publications, most of them reformist newspapers, in the last several months.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: TRIP TO LIBYA  President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia accepted an invitation to visit Libya, Mr. Putin's foreign policy adviser said. Abdel Rahman Mohammed Shalgam, the Libyan foreign minister, issued the invitation during a meeting between the two in Moscow, an aide said, according to Russian media. No date for the trip was released.</p>

        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: ANTI-MILOSEVIC PLOT CHARGED  The Yugoslav government said it had arrested four Dutch citizens it said were planning to kidnap or kill President Slobodan Milosevic. Information Minister Goran Matic said the men were assassins sent by Western intelligence agencies to deliver a ''Serbian head'' to President Clinton. He showed a film in which a man speaking English with a Dutch accent said that he and his friends had been looking for people indicted by the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague, who would include Mr. Milosevic.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: HEARING IN KOSOVO KILLING  A sentencing hearing opened in Germany in the case of an American soldier who admitted killing an ethnic Albanian girl in Kosovo last January while serving with the peacekeeping force.

        <p>FIJI: REBELS CHARGED  About 150 rebels were hauled into court as prosecutors pressed the first charges stemming from a failed coup. Most were charged with unlawful assembly and released on bail. The jailed coup leader, George Speight, who set off the crisis in May when he and an armed gang took top government officials hostage, was charged with several criminal offenses, but officials said he was still being investigated for treason.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>BURUNDI: ARMY ACCUSED  Villagers in eastern Burundi have blamed the army for the recent killings of 53 civilians, many women and children. They said the army had killed the people near the town of Ruyigi because they had refused to move into a temporary ''regroupment'' camp as the Tutsi-dominated army searched for ethnic Hutu rebels. The army has forced thousands of mainly Hutu farmers into camps in a bid to flush out the rebels, and frequently tell villagers that anyone found outside the camps will be treated like rebels.</p>

        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: MURDER CHARGE  A policeman was charged with murder in the shooting death of a parliamentarian for the African National Congress in the KwaZulu Natal province, a killing that was quickly deemed political by local members of the A.N.C. Some officers insisted that the shooting of Bheki Mkhize, which occurred while the police were searching Mr. Mkhize's home for illegal weapons, was accidental. But the shooting caused a stir in the province, where many police officers are members of the A.N.C.'s political rival, the Inkatha Freedom Party.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: HEAVY COMBAT  Government authorities said they regained control of the hamlet of Arboleda, the scene over the weekend of a 30-hour battle between the country's largest leftist guerrilla group and security forces in which at least 17 people, including civilians, died. Some of the 29 policeman garrisoned in the hamlet 90 miles northwest of Bogota are believed to have been kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.</p>

        <p>BERMUDA: VICTORY FOR SHORTS  Lawmakers voted to make Bermuda shorts -- the British colony's major contribution to world fashion -- acceptable dress in Parliament. The new dress code also allows Safari suits and Nehru jackets for men and pants suits for women.</p>
