        <p>A week into the horror writer Stephen King's closely watched experiment with self-publishing on the Internet, Mr. King said yesterday that he is about to break even.</p>
        <p>Publishers are eager to see how many people download the first chapter of Mr. King's new electronic novel, ''The Plant,'' about a vampiric vine's assault on a publishing house, in part because the venture tests the proposition that marketing and distribution via the Web can reduce authors' dependence on conventional publishers, at least for famous writers with plenty of money and fans.</p>
        <p>In a statement on his Web site, Mr. King estimated that readers downloaded 152,132 copies in the first seven days, and he promised that he would continue writing new installments, at least for now.</p>
        <p>He had asked readers voluntarily to pay him a dollar for each chapter downloaded, and had said he would stop writing if he did not receive payments for 75 percent of them. But Mr. King reported that 116,200 had paid or promised to pay, meeting his threshold to continue writing. He said 93,200 had already paid by credit card through Amazon.com, which is collecting for him.</p>
        <p>Estimating the proportion of downloaders who are paying required some finesse, said William Thornton, who operates the site. He said that readers had downloaded a total of 227,000 copies, but some were lost to user error and had to be repeated. To account for repeats, Mr. King adjusted his assessment down to a number he considered ''fair,'' Mr. Thornton said.</p>
        <p>After just seven days, ''The Plant'' will soon be in the black. Mr. King said he spent about $124,150 on his self-publishing effort, including two advertisements, in Publishers Weekly and USA Today. A spokesman for Conxion Corporation, a computer server company that is handling the downloads, said each download cost less than 2 cents. With $116,000 in payments promised, after seven days Mr. King is out roughly $10,000. He has few additional costs, and will soon be earning a profit on his experiment.</p>
        <p>On his Web site, Mr. King estimated that if he wrote 10 or 11 chapters, his readers might ultimately download 1,673,452 individual installments and pay him a dollar for each. ''Do the math,'' he wrote. ''It's pretty good math, if people keep coming back.''</p>
        <p>The next installment appears this month.</p>
