        <p>Following are excerpts from the speech by Laura Bush to the Republican National Convention last night, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>I'm so thrilled and I'm honored to be here, and I'll have to say I'm just a little bit overwhelmed to help open the convention that will nominate my husband for president of the United States.</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from the speech by Laura Bush to the Republican National Convention last night, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>I'm so thrilled and I'm honored to be here, and I'll have to say I'm just a little bit overwhelmed to help open the convention that will nominate my husband for president of the United States.</p>
        <p>You know -- thanks everybody -- you know I'm completely objective when I say you've made a great choice.</p>
        <p>George and I have been blessed throughout our 23 years of marriage with many interesting opportunities.</p>
        <p>Our lives have changed enormously in the last six years.</p>
        <p>George was elected governor. We moved to Austin with our then-13-year-old twin girls.</p>
        <p>Since then, we've been through dating, drivers' licenses and, just a few weeks ago, high school graduation.</p>
        <p>Now, now we're helping our daughters pack for college, and we're preparing for our next life crisis: empty-nest syndrome.</p>
        <p>They say that parents often have to get out of the house when their kids go off to college because it seems so lonely.</p>
        <p>Everyone deals with it in different ways.</p>
        <p>But I told George I thought running for president might be just a little extreme.</p>
        <p>I'm grateful for my family, who are here tonight: my mother, Jenna Welch, our daughters, Barbara and Jenna, and a couple that you all know pretty well, my mother-  and father-in-law. I love them all dearly. Thank you all.</p>
        <p>And now I want to thank Michael and the KIPP Academy students for that great introduction. I also want to thank them for very great education in Houston. Thank you all. Thank you so much.</p>
        <p>I've never given a speech before this many people before. But I feel very at-home in this classroom setting.</p>
        <p>Education is the living room of my life.</p>
        <p>George's opponent has been visiting schools lately and sometimes when he does he spends the night before at the home of a teacher.</p>
        <p>Well, George spends every night with a teacher.</p>
        <p>I first, I first decided to become a teacher -- thanks -- I first decided to become a teacher when I was in the second grade. Neither of my parents graduated from college. But I knew at an early age that they had that high hope and high expectation for me. My father bought an education policy, and he always said 'Don't worry, your education will be taken care of.' ''</p>
        <p>Growing up, I practiced teaching on my dolls. I'd line them up in rows for the day's lessons. Years later our daughters did the same thing. We used to joke that the Bush family had the best-educated dolls in America.</p>
        <p>George and I always read to our girls. Doctor Seuss's ''Hop on Pop'' was one of his favorites. George would lie on the floor to read the story and the girls would literally hop on pop, turning the story into a contact sport.</p>
        <p>We wanted to teach our children what our parents had taught us: that reading is entertaining and interesting and important.</p>
        <p>And one of the major reasons George is running for president is to make sure that every child in America has that same opportunity. That's why he's proposed a $5 billion Reading First initiative with a great American purpose: to make sure every child in every neighborhood can read on grade level by the end of the third grade.</p>
        <p>George led a similar initiative as governor with fabulous results. The highly respected nonpartisan Rand study released just last week found that education reforms in Texas have resulted in some of the highest achievement gains in the country among all racial, socioeconomic and family backgrounds.</p>
        <p>It happened because George led the way, focusing state money and schools' attention reading. We developed a rigorous research-based curriculum. We funded intensive in-school, after-school and summer-school reading intervention programs. We improved teacher training.</p>
        <p>When I taught school in Houston and Dallas and Austin, many of my second, third and fourth grade students couldn't read. And, frankly, I'm not sure I was very good at teaching them.</p>
        <p>I tried to make it fun by making the characters in children's books members of our class. We saved a web in the corner for Charlotte.</p>
        <p>But I know many teachers will agree that we need better training in what works to teach children to read.</p>
        <p>And as president, George will fund improved teacher training.</p>
        <p>Public school reforms are crucial. But they aren't enough.</p>
        <p>Learning to read starts much earlier.</p>
        <p>Researchers have learned that parents should read aloud to their babies. Toddlers' vocabularies are closely related to how much time adults spend talking to them.</p>
        <p>And importantly, listening to television doesn't help a young child develop language skills. It's just background noise.</p>
        <p>As first lady, I will make early childhood development one of my priorities.</p>
        <p>And George will strengthen Head Start to make sure it's an early reading and early learning program.</p>
        <p>I watched my husband make a difference as governor not by giving one speech on reading but by giving 100 speeches about reading, directing time, money and resources to our schools.</p>
        <p>And that's the kind of discipline and commitment George will bring to the presidency.</p>
        <p>He'll set great goals and he'll work tirelessly to achieve them.</p>
        <p>George and I grew up in Midland, Tex., a small town in a vast desert, a place where neighbors had to help each other because any other help was too far away. Midland was a place of family and community. And it had a sense of possibility as big as the West Texas sky. Midland formed value reserves as deep and longer-lasting than any of its oil wells.</p>
        <p>And from that wellspring of values, George developed the strength and the consistency of conviction. His core principles will not change with the winds of polls or politics or fame or fortune or misfortune.</p>
        <p>I know because I've known him through the big legislative successes and a few defeats. I sat by his side during some winning and many losing baseball seasons.</p>
        <p>But George never loses sight of home plate.</p>
        <p>I was looking through some scrapbooks recently.</p>
        <p>The first year we married, George ran for Congress in West Texas. And as I thumbed through those old brochures, what struck me is how the things George said then are the same things he believes now: that government should be limited, that local people make the best, that local people make the best decisions for their schools and communities, that all laws and policies, that all laws and policies should support strong families and that individuals, and that individuals are responsible for their actions.</p>
        <p>George stood, George stood on these principles as governor and he worked with Republicans and Democrats to build consensus and to get things done. He shares credit and he doesn't cast blame.</p>
        <p>He sets a tone that's positive and constructive, a tone that's very different from the bitterness and the division that too often characterize Washington, D.C.</p>
        <p>Finally, George has a strong sense of purpose. To quote the hymn that inspired his book, he believes that all of us have a charge to keep, a responsibility to use our different gifts to serve a cause greater than self.</p>
        <p>The president of the United States of America is more than a man, or a woman, as I hope the case will sometime be.</p>
        <p>The president is our most visible symbol of our country, of its heart and its values and its leadership in the world.</p>
        <p>And when Americans vote this November, they'll be looking for someone to uphold that honor and that trust.</p>
        <p>You can see it in the pictures. The pictures are one of the most compelling stories of this campaign. We first saw them on our very first campaign trip. They're the pictures of America's future. Moms and dads and grandparents bring them to parades and picnics. They hold out pictures of their children. And they say to George, I'm counting on you. I want my son or daughter to respect the president of the United States of America.</p>
        <p>George, George is a leader who inspires the best in others. And he'll bring out the best in our country.</p>
