        <p>Sheep dung once was up to the windows of what artists now call the seminar room.

But this summer William Christenberry, a photographer, used this former sheep shed to show slides for his course called Interaction of Media: Photography, Painting and Sculpture.</p>
        <p>Cattle barns and sheep sheds that until 1966 were the heart of an active ranch here now draw acclaimed and aspiring artists from around the world. The Anderson Ranch Arts Center, a four-and-a-half-acre campus eight miles west of Aspen, is a bucolic center for potters, photographers, painters, printmakers, woodworkers, sculptors, art historians and critics. From early June through late September the studios have more than a thousand professional and novice artists in workshops of one to two weeks on topics as basic as Making Stuff in Clay and as lofty as The Meaning of Mountains.</p>
        <p>Internationally renowned artists come to learn from one another and from experts in technologically new fields yet to be fully explored.</p>
        <p>New York has Chautauqua, New Hampshire has the MacDowell Colony, and North Carolina has the Penland School of Crafts. With its Rocky Mountain backdrop, its heady 8,200-foot altitude and its proximity to Aspen, Anderson Ranch has in three decades acquired a reputation for corralling curious artists in search of creative synergy.</p>
        <p>The ranch's course catalog is available in January, and half its courses were full by mid-March. Most workshops are limited to about a dozen participants, but because of the extensive pottery equipment, which include a kiln yard with five gas kilns, a wood kiln, a Japanese Anagama kiln and several electric kilns, ceramics workshops can enroll as many as 16.</p>
        <p>For 15 years Doug Casebeer, a former ceramics consultant to the United Nations, has directed the ceramics program at the ranch. Mr. Casebeer said that artists generally recognize that their profession can require a selfish self-absorption, but that Anderson Ranch is an ''arena where we can all come together, leave the egos at the door, appreciate that everybody has something to say.''</p>
        <p>This summer Paul Soldner, the center's first artistic director, and a fellow ceramic artist, Peter Voulkos, will again teach A Lifetime of Clay, a workshop that encourages ''mentorship and an exchange of ideas.'' Late in July, Ah Leon, a Taiwanese ceramic artist specializing in Yixing-style teapots and sculpture, will lead The Language of Tea: Dissecting the Teapot, which the catalog calls ''a total immersion in the tea experience.''</p>
        <p>Most workshops meet from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, with a break for lunch. Studios are open 24 hours a day. Tuition ranges from $250 for a one-week course called Art and Mud: A Course for Teachers, to $550 for a two-week sculpture class taught by the sculptor Laura Thorne, to $1,295 for two weeks of John Sexton's lab intensive photography course.</p>
        <p>At the cafe these days, which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner al fresco and cappuccino and biscotti late into the night, the Texas sculptor James Surls can often be found sitting beside a 60-year-old lawyer, accountant or business executive who has come to try a first studio art course.</p>
        <p>Seven years ago at age 67, Lloyd Schermer, then chairman of Lee Enterprises, a media company, decided to take his first drawing course. ''Taking a course in art, for Pete's sake. I was terrified,'' Mr. Schermer said. Since then he has taken classes in watercolor, figure drawing, oil, acrylic, collage and monotype (single print) and has become an enthusiastic monotype artist.</p>
        <p>Relying sometimes on wood type he salvaged from one of his newspapers in Missoula, Mont., Mr. Schermer has painted and sculptured and sold more than 100 of his works, which are in the collections of the National Museum of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution, the Aspen Institute, the Tribune Company and the Hearst Corporation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schermer and his wife, Betty, have been donors to the ranch and served on its board; the meeting hall dedicated in 1999 was named for them.</p>
        <p>In August performers from Jazz Aspen will fill the ranch with music. In past years B. B. King stopped by for an impromptu performance. Larry Rivers, the painter, once picked up his saxophone and surprised students with an unexpected riff.</p>
        <p>Artists come from as far away as Nepal, Jamaica and Japan. There are children's workshops for ages 6 through 15.</p>
        <p>Artists can apply for short or long residencies. Past visiting artists have included the Japanese ceramist Takashi Nakazato, the performance artist Laurie Anderson and the painters Red Grooms and Jim Dine.</p>
        <p>The ranch, with an annual budget of $2.8 million, has 55,000 square feet of studios and housing and offers as many as 150 scholarships a year. Full-time art students and art teachers are offered a 50 percent discount on tuition for courses in which space is available.</p>
        <p>Mr. Surls, the sculptor, who has been an invited artist in residence for two years, said that the ranch center had given him ''a midcareer jump, a new lease on life, a second wind.''</p>
        <p>''We are not in the same West of Remington and Russell,'' he said. ''Today there is an incredibly complex set of references. I think everybody conjures from his environment. The landscape here is beautiful. The weather is great. My work has totally opened up. This terrain change has created a head change.''</p>
        <p>James Baker, a photographer and 14-year veteran of the ranch who has been its executive director for five years, said it offered the ''gift of time and space, an opportunity to blend idealism with pragmatism.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker added: ''At a time when our economy is so strong, we've got everything we want except what we really need. You can see that yearning. Society needs this type of fulfillment. To be human is to create, and people need opportunities to create.''</p>
