        <p>The Internet has given a platform to death-row inmates and other American prisoners to plead their cases and seek pen pals, sparking outrage among many families of victims and creating a new debate about the rights of the growing number of prisoners.</p>
        <p>While no American prison allows inmates access to the Internet, prisoners use third-party services, usually for a fee, to reach out to a potentially huge audience.</p>
        <p>In Texas, dozens of inmates like Michael Blue, who is on death row, appear on Web sites saying they were wrongly convicted of murder. On one Web site, Mr. Blue is described as ''a little shy, honest, caring, loving.''</p>
        <p>A California inmate, Askia Ashanti, appears on a Web site looking for ''a pro bono attorney or $5,000 to $10,000 in funds to hire an attorney.''</p>
        <p>And Beau Greene, who is imprisoned in Arizona, appears on a Web site in a picture, cradling a fluffy cat and asking for pen pals. Mr. Greene is described as ''bored and lonely with a surplus of time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greene, 32, does not mention that he was convicted in 1996 of killing a slender, 58-year-old musician, Roy Johnson, by bashing the man's head against rocks.</p>
        <p>When the victim's daughter, Jennifer Johnson Lopez, discovered the Web site, she said she was horrified that the killer, ''trying to look all warm and cuddly,'' was able to use the Internet to escape his feeling of confinement.</p>
        <p>''I was disgusted,'' Ms. Johnson Lopez said. ''He said he missed companionship. I thought, 'Serves you right.' ''</p>
        <p>Victims' rights groups complain that it is humiliating for victims and their families to see prisoners popping up on Web sites. And the groups also complain that some people browsing the Internet might begin correspondence with violent criminals or fall for their stories without knowing the real details of their crimes.</p>
        <p>In the face of such criticism, officials in New York and Arizona have enacted policies or laws that forbid prisoners to use third-party Internet service providers. Washington and other states have debated similar measures.</p>
        <p>But in the view of many civil libertarians, these measures infringe on the First Amendment rights of inmates. Eleanor Eisenberg, the executive director of the Arizona chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said her group was considering filing a lawsuit against the Arizona measure.</p>
        <p>''It clearly impinges on an inmate's First Amendment right to communicate,'' Ms. Eisenberg said. ''It also chills the rights of third parties who have committed no crimes.''</p>
        <p>Prison officials, however, say they are frustrated by the Web sites, and they say the Internet has allowed prisoners to have soapboxes to prey on the innocent and softhearted.</p>
        <p>''The Internet has given these criminals worldwide access and the ability to raise huge amounts of money,'' said Gary Phelps, the chief of staff for the Arizona Department of Corrections. ''Besides that, we've got women coming from Australia, Belgium, England -- all wanting to see these men they've met on the Internet.''</p>
        <p>The Internet has also become a tool in championing the causes of individual inmates, such as Mumia Abu-Jamal, who defenders contend was wrongly convicted of killing a police officer in Philadelphia in 1981.</p>
        <p>At least a dozen Web sites carry details about the case and history of Mr. Abu-Jamal. One of the largest sites, operated by a private anti-death-penalty group in New York called Refuse and Resist, describes the inmate as ''a prominent radio journalist'' being punished because he ''allowed the angry and anguished voices of the oppressed onto the airwaves.''</p>
        <p>It features a photograph of Mr. Abu-Jamal, smiling and raising a clenched fist.</p>
        <p>A page on the Web site, under a headline reading ''The Frame-Up,'' calls the police account absurd and says that witnesses in Mr. Abu-Jamal's defense were harassed by law enforcement authorities. The site invites people to join marches around the country on Mr. Abu-Jamal's behalf. It also encourages Web site visitors to print and distribute the posting to other potential supporters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abu-Jamal's lawyer, Leonard Weinglass, said the Internet had allowed people around the world to closely follow Mr. Abu-Jamal's case. ''If something happens in court, it's important that our friends in France, Germany and Denmark be informed,'' Mr. Weinglass said.</p>
        <p>Brian Henninger, a spokesman for the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, said that group had used its Web site to ''build a campaign of support for inmates,'' like its recent series on young prisoners, ''Stop Killing Kids.''</p>
        <p>''Cyberorganizing is still an art form that's being reinvented,'' Mr. Henninger said. ''It's one way that very small organizations can have a very large impact.''</p>
        <p>The anti-death-penalty group has posted online petitions, as well as sample letters to Congress and state governors asking for appeals and clemency for inmates.</p>
        <p>The Canadian Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty allows any American inmate to post background information at no cost. And some defense lawyers have used the Internet to plead the cases of their clients.</p>
        <p>In most cases, the prisoners are simply looking for people to write to them, a way of whiling away the hours in their cells.</p>
        <p>American prison authorities have long read inmates' mail, except for legal correspondence and letters to elected officials. But in recent years, prisons have made it more difficult for inmates to have contact with people on the outside, said Steve Bright, the director of the Southern Center For Human Rights, an advocacy group for inmates' rights.</p>
        <p>''It used to be viewed as a positive to stay in touch with the outside world, since the idea was that people would be rehabilitated and then returned to society,'' Mr. Bright said. ''Now the attitude is to make the prisons as punitive as possible and make the prisoners as miserable as possible.''</p>
        <p>In general, he said, the courts have almost always sided with prison authorities in clamping down on the ability of inmates to communicate with outsiders, especially reporters.</p>
        <p>In New York, while inmates are forbidden to receive mail from third-party services, they can send mail to these services, as long as they disclose that they are prison inmates.</p>
        <p>''We believe in truth in inmate advertising,'' said James Flateau, a spokesman for the New York Department of Correctional Services. ''We want people to know who they're writing to.''</p>
        <p>Like many other state prison systems, the New York correctional department posts an ''inmate look-up'' on the Internet so the potential pen pals can learn about a prisoner's record, Mr. Flateau said, ''and decide for themselves if that's someone they want to write to.''</p>
        <p>The growing American prison population, together with the surging interest in the death penalty, has given rise to a handful of third-party Internet access providers who typically charge a fee to inmates for posting their information.</p>
        <p>While prisoners have always sent letters seeking supporters, the Internet has vastly increased the potential to reach large audiences far from their cells.</p>
        <p>Rarely do these Internet access providers vouch for the accuracy of the inmates' claims. In addition, some Web sites are maintained by families of inmates.</p>
        <p>One of the largest third-party Internet services for inmates is run by the Rev. Rene Mulkey, who operates in rural Missouri and has a client list of about 1,500 prisoners.</p>
        <p>For $10, a fee that Ms. Mulkey says is used to defray mailing costs, inmates can have a biographical sketch posted on her Web site, usually with a photograph, a first name and an identification number. When people send messages to individual prisoners, she forwards them through the United States Postal Service.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the guys are asking for romance, or friends, or just plain encouragement,'' Ms. Mulkey said.</p>
        <p>Except for very few cases, inmates have not been able to raise sizable amounts of money through the Internet, despite their frequent requests for contributions, or to secure pro bono lawyers to defend them.</p>
        <p>''If they're looking for money for a legal defense fund,'' Ms. Mulkey said, ''I tell them that's probably not going to happen.''</p>
        <p>She said her empathy for inmates stemmed, in part, from what she described as a ''false arrest record'' that had haunted her late husband. ''Things are not always what they seem to be,'' she said. ''The press makes these guys out to be animals, but they're not.''</p>
        <p>But Jane McGrath, a Republican state legislator who sponsored the Arizona bill prohibiting inmates from using third-party Internet services, said it galled the families of victims to see the smiling faces of criminals who describe themselves as decent people.</p>
        <p>''Have you ever run into a criminal who says, 'Yeah, I did it'?'' Ms. McGrath asked. ''Well, the Internet allows these people to distort history. It's a way of further victimizing the victim.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 3, 2000, Thursday  An article on Tuesday about prisoners' access to the Internet misstated the surname of a woman who discovered that her father's killer uses a Web site to seek pen pals. She is Jennifer Johnson Martinez, not Lopez. The article also misstated the given name of an Arizona legislator who sponsored a bill prohibiting inmates from using third-party Internet services. She is Jean McGrath, not Jane.</p>
