        <p>As boys back in Wisconsin, D. Wayne Lukas and Clyde Rice watched wild mustangs file off the trucks en route to the knackers who turned them into feed for the nearby mink farms.</p>
        <p>The pair identified the good-looking ones, bought them for a few more pennies on the pound, cleaned them up and resold them to the local farmers at a decent profit. When Rice's daughter beat Lukas here in last week's Sanford Stakes with City Zip -- a 2-year-old costing a modest $9,000 -- it appeared Linda Rice had inherited her father's eye for a bargain.</p>
        <p>Lukas's taste, however, has grown more extravagant. The Sanford runner-up, Yonaguska, was picked up for $1.95 million seven months ago as a 2-year-old. On the same afternoon, Lukas introduced a $3 million 3-year-old named LaSalle Street whom Mike Tabor had purchased for $2 million. He finished ninth, beaten by 20 1/2 lengths. On Sunday, Lukas unveiled another high-dollar purchase, Padua's Pride, for whom Satish and Anne Sanan had paid a record $4,433,625 as a weanling in England. How did Padua's Pride -- the impeccably bred son of the European sire Caerlon and half-brother to the former European 3-year-old champion Generous -- fare? Ninth.</p>
        <p>All in all, it was not a tremendously productive opening week for Lukas, the Hall of Fame trainer, who has conditioned 20 national championship horses and won 13 Triple Crown races. He has yet to win here. But Lukas is taking it in stride. He has the perennial runner-up Cat Thief, without a victory in eight starts since winning the Breeders' Cup Classic last fall, ready for Sunday's Whitney Stakes. And his prize 2-year-old filly, Sanibel Island, the second foal from the champion Flanders, will be in a maiden race in the next two weeks after a cough forced her to scratch last week. ''You're going to like her a lot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Surfside, Sanibel Island's older three-quarters sister, should run toward the end of the meet. She was 7 of 10 in her career before being sidelined in April because of bone chips. Ultimately, Lukas is a realist. ''When you play at the top end, they don't all always work out,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His owners believe him. The Sanans and their Padua Stable were the top buyers at last month's Keeneland yearling sale, spending $14.4 million on 12 yearlings, including the two sales toppers -- a $3.6 million filly and a $3.3 million colt.</p>
        <p>Jockeys to Watch</p>
        <p>After a week of racing, Jerry Bailey is at the top of the jockey standing with nine victories, followed by Jorge Chavez with seven and John Velazquez with six.</p>
        <p>But a couple of first-time Saratoga riders have the crowds curious. On the second day of the meet, Masi Ebina made his trip from Japan worthwhile by bringing home Grandma Lu by daylight. The 31-year-old Ebina was the Bailey of Japan before deciding to try his hand in the States at the end of June. He has gotten good reviews from fellow jockeys but is struggling to learn English. His interpreter has been vital, but Ebina is accelerating his learning curve for a more practical reason. ''If I do not speak English, I can't ask trainers to put me on horses,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another newcomer, Marlon St. Julien, scored his first victory today when he hustled Dynameesch down a sloppy lane to overcome the front-running Biosintesis in the fourth race. As the first African-American rider in the Kentucky Derby since 1921, St. Julien finished seventh aboard Curule this year.</p>
        <p>He has worked himself through bush tracks in his native Louisiana to leading-rider status in Texas, and has been a top contender in Chicago and Kentucky. He says he is a restless sort and, like Ebina, intends to ride full time in New York. He finished second here on opening day.</p>
        <p>''I came close, but ever since I've been back, back, back,'' St. Julien said. ''The trainers here know I'm a good rider and say they'll give me a chance, but I understand they need to see wins. I got one today and the more I get, the better rides I'll have.'' St. Julien's agent is the former New York rider Randy Romero.</p>
        <p>Winning in a Splash</p>
        <p>Continuous rain and a swampy track pruned a full field of 14 horses for the Grade III Lake George Stakes today to nine. Among the casualties was the favored Gaviola. The one-and-one-sixteenth-mile race was captured by the Bobby Frankel-trained Millie's Quest, who needed a late splashing ride from John Velazquez to nail the $70,080 winner's share of the $116,800 purse. The 3-year-old filly paid $13 for $2 to win.</p>
