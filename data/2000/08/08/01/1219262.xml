        <p>It is a secret world of chance meetings between strangers, of quietly arranged hookups, of one-time encounters that can turn passionate or can even blossom into semipermanence.</p>
        <p>This is not the rave scene.</p>
        <p>This is the territory of Mozart and Brahms and Beethoven.</p>
        <p>Of the many social scenes that weave through New York's night life, few are lesser known than the chamber music crowd. And few have so many dedicated denizens.</p>
        <p>Piano trios, string quartets, wind quintets and other permutations coalesce within apartment walls and then melt away, or meet once for a reading, or grow old together. Many players find one another through Amateur Chamber Music Players Inc., a worldwide organization that lists some 500 members in New York City in a sort of giant collective personal ad. Others navigate in small, informal networks.</p>
        <p>In fact, the amateur classical music world in this city extends far beyond chamber groups.</p>
        <p>There are orchestras: the Doctors' Orchestra, the Lawyers' Orchestra, the Brooklyn Heights Orchestra and ensembles at the Bloomingdale School of Music and 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, among others. Many of the city's more than 20 community music schools have chamber music programs for amateurs. Around the country, there are dozens of weekend or weeklong seminars for players willing to travel, and to pay. One of the most popular seminars runs for a weekend in March under the auspices of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. And this is not to mention youth orchestras and choruses.</p>
        <p>The most fervent devotees seem to be the chamber musicians.</p>
        <p>''I've no hesitation about calling absolute strangers, although more and more you get to know people and have musical friends,'' said Joan Edelstein, a flutist and director of the physical therapy program at Columbia University. ''In some cases they become unqualified friends.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Edelstein plays weekly in a wind quintet, whose previous incarnation lasted 12 years. Her husband, Haskell Edelstein, a bassoonist and tax lawyer, plays in two other quintets and two community orchestras. They play in frequent one-time gatherings and a sometime nonet. When they travel, they always stop in on the local music store, a practice that has swollen their sheet music collection to four shelves' worth.</p>
        <p>Of course, amateur music-making has been around as long as classical music. At first a province of the aristocracy, it broadened into a bourgeois pursuit with the rise of the middle class in the 19th century. Think of Schubertiade evenings in middle Europe or parlor soirees in mid-Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In an age overwhelmed by electronic pursuits, this acoustic world -- at least in New York -- seems to be flourishing.</p>
        <p>The issue is important for those who worry about the health of classical music in America. Amateur musicians are the best sort of audience, informed to the point that they have played the very pieces on a night's concert program. Many serve on the boards of musical institutions, or as arts administrators. Amateur dollars provide income for professional teachers and chamber music coaches.</p>
        <p>And amateur music-making offers an avenue to the types of social bonds and friendships that have declined as life has sped up, a problem addressed by Robert D. Putnam in his recent book ''Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community'' (Simon &amp; Schuster).  Mr. Putnam, a Harvard University political scientist, argues that civic engagement and private networks have declined over the past 30 years, to America's detriment.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Putnam presents data in his book that shows a decrease in the number of Americans in the last 25 years who play instruments, the data does not break out classical music or chamber music. There are, however, indications that these musical ranks have been growing.</p>
        <p>The Amateur Chamber Music Players says its membership has increased by about 800 since the mid-1990's, to 4,900. ''For every member we have I am sure there are four or five who play quartets with a member who just didn't join,'' said Daniel Nimetz, executive director of the association . And the National Guild of Community Schools of the Arts estimates there are 600 arts schools in the country, and more than two-thirds of its members were founded in the last 20 years.</p>
        <p>Quantity is nice, but to many musicians, it is the quality that counts. ''Chamber music by its very nature is a kind of analogue for community,'' said Daniel Epstein, a New Yorker and the pianist of the Raphael Trio. ''It requires cooperation, it requires empathy, it requires listening to other people, all the things you have to do in society to make society run successfully.''</p>
        <p>The devotion of some amateur musicians knows few bounds, judging by the behavior at a chamber music workshop that the Raphael Trio runs in Adamant, Vt., for adult amateurs.</p>
        <p>''They get to camp and before they even unpack they pull out their instruments and start playing,'' Mr. Epstein said. ''They'll play far into the night. People tell us they look forward to this week the whole year. It really gives meaning to the word amateur, in a true sense of the word, somebody who loves something. It's not a job to them. It's something that goes right to the heart of who they are and what they love.''</p>
        <p>It is hard to overestimate the zeal of these amateurs. One subject, Dr. Franz Alt, a retired mathematician at the Bureau of Standards in Washington who fled the Nazi occupation of Austria in 1938, approaches people carrying string instruments on the subway to his neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''I make it a habit of collecting people in Washington Heights who play,'' said Mr. Alt, a violist who takes part in four or five regular quartets at any one time. Mr. Alt is 89.</p>
        <p>At the Amateur Chamber Music Players association, joining simply means gaining a place in a worldwide directory. Musicians grade themselves. Members are encouraged to call one another. New members are asked to volunteer a contribution of $20. A Web site, www.acmp.net, allows members to search for players by instrument, location and grade. In one way, the digital age helps. E-mailing has made contacting players much easier.</p>
        <p>A typical evening of the chamber association took shape Wednesday.</p>
        <p>It was an eclectic mix, like a New York 2000 version of those bomber crews in old World War II movies. There were the Edelsteins; a music therapist; a synagogue caretaker for the Soslowitz Hasidic sect; a federal prosecutor; an official of the city's Department of Environmental Protection; a computer consultant; and a dot-com employee. A reporter sat in. The ages ranged from late 20's to early 60's.</p>
        <p>The evening was organized by Laurence Beckhardt, the environmental official, who borrowed a sister-in-law's large living room in TriBeCa. The program: two wind octets by Mozart, and nonets by Charles Gounod and Theodore Gouvy.</p>
        <p>Chitchat was minimal. There were deferential offers to play second parts. Roles emerged. Barry Fader, the caretaker and an oboist, revealed his former life as a professional musician by occasionally calling for a chord or attack to be repeated, just to get it right. Mr. Haskell, a true veteran of the amateur circuit, assumed the mantle of raconteur and joke-teller. (''Did you hear the one about the soprano standing outside her door in the rain? She forgot her key and didn't know when to come in.'') Jennifer Miller, French horn player and music therapist and another former pro, seemed the most assured on tempi.</p>
        <p>That, in fact, was the chief source of discussion -- how fast to play a movement. ''Too bad this is a democracy,'' Mr. Fader said at one point with a wry tone.</p>
        <p>There is a seamy side -- well, as far as it goes -- in the key and fingerboard set.</p>
        <p>Some players refuse to play in a group that includes an individual they do not like. Sessions can become a wedge between a musician and a nonplaying spouse, or even the source of jealousy when a spouse perceives a rival in the group.</p>
        <p>Anthony Finley, a lawyer and violist, attends a lavish chamber music party in Darien, Conn., every December. ''People bring their spouses, but they group together and leave early,'' he said. ''Then we switch around, go from group to group, room to room. It's almost like a music orgy.''</p>
        <p>A recurrent theme among association members is frustration with players who overrate themselves.</p>
        <p>''It's no fun to be in a group with people who play less well,'' said David Greenwald, the federal prosecutor and an oboist. ''And in the long run, it's better not to play with people who are better than you, because they will resent you. You want to find your own level.''</p>
        <p>Chamber association sessions have a vague etiquette. An offering of drinks is usually important. Don't criticize fellow musicians unless you know them well enough to rib. Try not to be late. It's hard enough getting a bunch of busy professionals together. Be tactful.</p>
        <p>''You have to be careful about not stepping on anybody's toes,'' Mr. Fader said. ''But musicians don't like to be superficial. It's an art that requires great depth of expression.''</p>
        <p>English is not necessary. Mr. Finley says he once played string quartets with an Italian, Japanese and German. Only the Italian spoke English, to a degree. ''Who you end up playing with is sometimes a complete mystery,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I think that people generally regard that having a pleasant evening and being hospitable and having something to eat and telling good stories is almost as important as the music,'' Mr. Finley added.</p>
