        <p>On Thursday night, Republican delegates from across the nation will gather here to nominate George W. Bush as their candidate for president. But one particularly prominent Republican delegate from the state of New York has decided to skip the climactic night of his party's nominating convention.</p>
        <p>The delegate -- Representative Rick A. Lazio, Hillary Rodham Clinton's opponent in this year's race for Senate in New York -- was also one of the very few prominent New York Republicans missing from an invitation-only convention party hosted by Gov. George E. Pataki and Bloomberg on Sunday evening. And he turned down an invitation from convention organizers for a brief, way-out-of-prime-time speech today, instead opting for a swift visit here on Tuesday for a fund-raiser and a  speech with New York delegates at their hotel. That might be the closest Mr. Lazio ever makes it to the convention floor during this four-day session.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's advisers said that he had decided to steer clear of Philadelphia because he believed that he could more profitably spend his time campaigning in New York. But Mr. Lazio's official campaign schedule for today lists not a single public campaign event -- and his aides were unable today to say precisely what he will be doing in New York on Thursday night when Mr. Bush is nominated in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The question of the whereabouts of Mr. Lazio, who for many Republicans has assumed star status in his role as the man who might block Mrs. Clinton's entry into elective office, echoed through the throngs of revelers eating oysters and lobster salad at Mr. Pataki's party on Sunday, and today emerged as one of the few intriguing questions at a convention at which matters of suspense have been in short supply.</p>
        <p>The answer seems to be that after some negotiations -- and considerable division among Mr. Lazio's advisers, some of whom had pushed for Mr. Lazio to get a large role at the conventions -- both Mr. Lazio's associates and organizers of their convention concluded that it was in neither side's interest for Mr. Lazio to have the kind of high-profile spot here that Mrs. Clinton has been promised at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles. The convention organizers' offered Mr. Lazio a minor role in the proceedings, speaking along with other candidates for Senate, an offer Mr. Lazio turned down.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's chief political strategist, Mike Murphy, said today that Mr. Lazio already felt he had lost time campaigning because of his Congressional obligations, which have forced him to spend more time in Washington than he would have liked. Congress is out of session this week, and Mr. Murphy said Mr. Lazio decided to spend just one day here, and take advantage of the respite to concentrate on his New York campaign.</p>
        <p>''We're going to have one great day here and then get back to work in New York,'' Mr. Murphy said this evening, speaking in an interview on the convention floor. He said that the demand of the campaign was the sole factor in that decision.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign spokesman, Dan McLagan, said that appearing in Pennsylvania ''doesn't move the ball down the field. The campaign's priorities are in New York -- we're not running for national office.''</p>
        <p>But other Republicans here suggested that other things might be in play for Mr. Lazio. For example, at a time when Mrs. Clinton has been trying to draw the contest as an ideological Republican-versus-Democratic one, it might not be in Mr. Lazio's interest to be associated with a gathering that is, ultimately, a celebration of the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mrs. Clinton's campaign moved quickly today to stoke the perception that Mr. Lazio was in a bit of a predicament. Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said that Mr. Lazio was ''trying to run away from his party,'' adding, ''In Washington, Rick Lazio is proud to be a member of the Republican leadership, but in New York he tries to hide the fact that he's a Republican at all.''</p>
        <p>The party's national co-chairman, Pat Harrison, disputed that claim tonight, asserting that she understood Mr. Lazio's absence and said he would have been welcome to enjoy a larger role here. ''I think he just has decided that he needs to be campaigning 24 hours a day,'' Mrs. Harrison said.</p>
        <p>Still, several Republicans suggested the party might have little interest in providing Mr. Lazio a prime position. Convention speakers have been instructed to avoid critical remarks in general -- and attacks on President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in particular. Such restrictions might have proved problematic for Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to speak directly before her husband on the opening night of her own party's convention in Los Angeles.</p>
