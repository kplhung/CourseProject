        <p>A novel form of cancer treatment, based on a defective virus that can grow only in cancerous cells, has passed another milestone by showing promise in treating patients with recurrent head and neck cancer.</p>
        <p>The treatment is based on a deep insight into the nature of cancer cells and will, if it works, become one of the first practical contributions to cancer therapy of the theoretical knowledge that has long been accumulating.</p>
        <p>The virus, known as Onyx-015, has been used in a Phase 2 clinical trial, a test in which a small number of patients are treated.</p>
        <p>A larger number of patients are now being recruited for a final, Phase 3 trial, which will determine whether the treatment is effective enough for clinical practice.</p>
        <p>The Phase 2 results, reported in today's issue of Nature Medicine, involved 30 patients with head and neck cancer, most of whom had already failed surgery or radiation treatments. Patients in whom this kind of cancer recurs are considered incurable.</p>
        <p>In 63 percent of the patients treated with a combination of Onyx-015 and chemotherapy, the tumors shrank by 50 percent or more, and in 8 of these 19 responding patients the tumors disappeared altogether.</p>
        <p>''We treated patients at seven different centers and we all saw some pretty striking results,'' said Dr. Fadlo R. Khuri of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, speaking for himself and the other physicians involved in the trial.</p>
        <p>Dr. Khuri described himself as ''cautiously optimistic'' about the treatment, but said a larger trial was necessary.  ''Many things look wonderful in Phase 2 but not in Phase 3,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The trial has confirmed that Onyx-015 grows and replicates in cancer cells but apparently not in the ordinary cells of the body.</p>
        <p>But there are many features of the virus's behavior that remain to be understood. In Phase 1 tests, Onyx-015 given by itself had lasting effects in only 15 percent of head and neck cancer patients. The reason may be that the cancers are solid tumors, infiltrated by normal cells, and in many cases injections of the virus may not have reached all parts of the tumors.</p>
        <p>A lesson from the Phase 1 tests was that the virus was much more effective when given in combination with chemotherapy. In the Phase 2 trial, patients received chemotherapy to the whole body while the tumors were injected directly with the virus. The cause of death in most patients was from other tumors that could not be injected.</p>
        <p>Dr. Everett E. Vokes, a head and neck cancer specialist at the University of Chicago, said that the survival time of the patients in the study was ''very encouraging.'' Onyx-015, he added is a ''very promising, intriguing, genetically based agent.'' He suggested that the virus and the chemotherapy might be effective in combination because the virus was killing the cells in the center of the tumors while the chemotherapy was attacking those on the periphery, which the virus did not reach.</p>
        <p>Another head and neck cancer specialist, Dr. David Pfister of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said the Onyx-015 concept was important but that a larger trial was necessary.</p>
        <p>The use of the virus to attack tumors was conceived of by Dr. Frank McCormick, now director of the University of California at San Francisco Cancer Center. Dr. McCormick is a co-founder of a company, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, that supplies the virus.</p>
        <p>The first trials were with head and neck cancer because the virus was expected to work particularly well with that type of tumor. But Dr. McCormick now believes the virus may be able to infect almost all types of cancer cell.</p>
        <p>Other trials of Onyx-015 are now in progress with liver metastases, ovarian and pancreatic cancer, and general advanced cancers, he said.</p>
        <p>Onyx-015 is an adenovirus, one of the causes of the common cold, with a damaged gene. In a normal adenovirus, this gene swings into action as soon as the virus has entered a cell and makes a product that inactivates a vital cell component called the p53 protein. The role of p53 is to prevent a cell from dividing if its DNA is damaged or if the cell is under viral attack.</p>
        <p>In many types of cancer cells, the p53 gene is damaged by mutation. Dr. McCormick's insight was to realize that though Onyx-015 could not grow in normal cells, because it could not inactivate their p53 protein, it could grow in cancer cells that had already disabled their own p53 gene.</p>
        <p>In other words, the defective virus was in principle the long-sought agent that could discriminate between normal and cancerous cells, killing only the latter.</p>
        <p>One puzzle with tests of Onyx-015 is that the virus kills cancer cells with an intact p53 gene as well as its expected target, the cells with mutated p53 genes. Dr. McCormick believes he now knows the reason, which is that all cancer cells have to inactivate the p53 protein in one way or another or the tumor cannot grow.  Some tumor cells develop mutations in the p53 gene itself, but others inactivate the p53 protein indirectly: they sabotage a second gene whose product, called p14, is required by the cell to keep the p53 protein in active state.</p>
        <p>''P14 now explains perfectly a major difficulty which we couldn't understand,'' Dr. McCormick said.  Onyx-015 may therefore be effective against a wide range of tumor types, he believes.</p>
        <p>A commentary in Nature Medicine hails the new Onyx-015 result as a victory for the beleaguered field of gene therapy. But the two concepts are quite different. In gene therapy new genes are inserted into cells, often using a virus as the vector to deliver the genes. Onyx-015 is not a vector and carries no extra genes. ''It's not gene therapy, it's completely opposite,'' Dr. McCormick said.</p>
        <p>The author of the commentary, Dr. W. French Anderson, a gene therapist at the University of Southern California, said he viewed the two methods as related because they were handled by the same regulatory committee.</p>
        <p>The Phase 2 head and neck cancer trial is the most advanced of the various tests of Onyx-015 now under way. Though promising, the small number of patients is not yet proof it works. Still, the results were impressive to Dr. Khuri. ''I work in an area where you don't cure many people. You learn to relish the victories and this one had a few more victories than usual.''</p>
