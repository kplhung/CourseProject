        <p>Leaving Barneys in Order</p>
        <p>The journey to decision took place in part on a bike trip through northern Burgundy in June. It was there that Allen L.

        <p>Leaving Barneys in Order</p>
        <p>The journey to decision took place in part on a bike trip through northern Burgundy in June. It was there that Allen L. Questrom, the energetic and well-regarded retail executive, weighed the pros and cons of leaving Barneys New York, where he has been chairman and president for 15 months, to become chief executive of a Kiehl's-free J. C. Penney on Sept. 15.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't going to jump uncomfortably,'' Mr. Questrom said, referring to the fact that he wanted to make sure his formula for returning Barneys to solvency was in place. ''On the pro side,'' going to Penney ''was a unique challenge,'' he added. Barneys has sales close to $400 million, while Penney is a $33 billion company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Questrom, 60, who has served as chairman of Neiman Marcus and Federated Department Stores, oversaw Barneys as it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This year, Barneys is expected to be in the black.</p>
        <p>Mr. Questrom's departure signals the most dramatic in a series of changes at one of the world's most chic stores. In the spring, the company's public relations director, Jason Weisenfeld, left for the fledgling Pegasus Apparel Group.  His replacement, Dawn Brown, starts today. More recently, five vice presidents have left -- one for Banana Republic and four for the e-commerce beauty venture Eve.com. Most were replaced through internal promotions.</p>
        <p>''No one likes to lose people,'' Mr. Questrom said of the departures. ''I think it was about people thinking they were going to get rich in the dot-com business.'' The time merchants must spend traveling figured in some people's decisions, too, he added.</p>
        <p>''There were recent mothers and additional children,'' Mr. Questrom said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Questrom, who will retain a place on the Barneys board, says he is guiding the search for his successor, who should be named this month. That person, said a source close to the search process, is expected to be someone who, like Mr. Questrom, is more bottom-line focused than Dutch magazine-focused.</p>
        <p>Redrawing the Matrimonial Costume</p>
        <p>When you have ascended to the status of sexiest man alive and it comes time to ally your greatness with another's in matrimony, no one would expect you to wear a standard tux or Brooks Brothers suit to the wedding.</p>
        <p>When Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston married in Malibu, Calif., over the weekend, Mr. Pitt proved he is not a heartthrob of banal tastes. In July, he phoned the men's wear designer Hedi Slimane, who caused such a stir with his sexually infused clothes at Yves Saint Laurent before leaving the company in the spring, to tell him he needed something to wear to a wedding. The result -- a narrow three-button suit of barathea wool paired with a skinny black taffeta tie and poplin shirt -- marked Mr. Slimane's debut as men's wear designer at Christian Dior, a job he started a few weeks ago. Mr. Slimane, who sent an assistant to fit Mr. Pitt in Los Angeles, cut the suit in the Dior atelier in Paris. The same assistant flew back to deliver the suit personally, an effort made ''to respect confidentiality,'' a spokesman for Dior in Paris said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Slimane had dressed Mr. Pitt for the Oscars this year and the Grammys last year. The bride, by the way, wore a beaded dress by Lawrence Steele.</p>
        <p>A Women's Power Lunch, on the House</p>
        <p>Today at noon, about 60 women, many part of the rare subspecies of New Yorkers who probably could get a reservation at Alain Ducasse if they picked up the phone -- Carolina Herrera, Veronica Bulgari, Aerin and Jane Lauder, Tina Brown -- will be dining at the city's most inaccessible restaurant as guests of Harper's Bazaar. The magazine is the host of a lunch themed ''Women in Power.'' The restaurant's chef and owner, Alain Ducasse, was featured in Bazaar's July issue. Almost no one turned the invitation down, said a spokeswoman at PMK, which is handling Bazaar's publicity.</p>
        <p>With Ducasse meals costing hundreds of dollars a person, the lunch, the brainchild of Bazaar's publisher, Cynthia R. Lewis, could cost the magazine about $20,000. Ms. Lewis plans to have some sort of party every month in conjunction with each issue of Bazaar. The latest issue, August, features women in power, and one of them, CNN's Maria Bartiromo, will speak at the lunch.</p>
        <p>''Our advertisers have so many magazines out there they can't read them all,'' Ms. Lewis said. ''One of the greatest challenges a publisher has is to bring the magazine to life. The event itself will emote the mood of the magazine.''</p>
