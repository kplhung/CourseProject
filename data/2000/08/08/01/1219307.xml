        <p>In the first half of his first game on ABC's ''Monday Night Football,'' Dennis Miller twice remarked how much faster on-field action looked from the announcers' booth. The comedian sounded overwhelmed, if not mentally spent.</p>
        <p>''No, Toto, we're not in a studio in West Hollywood anymore,'' said Al Michaels, referring to rehearsals that he, Miller and Dan Fouts underwent before their debut at last night's San Francisco-New England preseason game.</p>

        <p>In the first half of his first game on ABC's ''Monday Night Football,'' Dennis Miller twice remarked how much faster on-field action looked from the announcers' booth. The comedian sounded overwhelmed, if not mentally spent.</p>
        <p>''No, Toto, we're not in a studio in West Hollywood anymore,'' said Al Michaels, referring to rehearsals that he, Miller and Dan Fouts underwent before their debut at last night's San Francisco-New England preseason game.</p>
        <p>They will get better as they work together and as games grow more meaningful than one in which Drew Bledsoe, the New England quarterback, leaves after one series in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Here's the problem posed by Miller's presence. When he's Milleresque, that is, being naturally funny, the gamble by ABC to hire him pays off. He elevates himself when he questions the oxymoron inherent in a ''minor groin injury'' or jokes about the 49ers' defensive line, ''If you wanted to put someone in the federal witness protection program, you'd put him on the 49ers' D-line.''</p>
        <p>Miller fits his singular role when he said this about Jeff Garcia, the man succeeding Steve Young as the 49ers' quarterback: ''He's the Canadian football quarterback with the Mexican name -- the Nafta quarterback.''</p>
        <p>Miller's hiring is justified when he skews standard analysis, as he did in talking about Patriot defensive back Tebucky Jones: ''They moved Tebucky back to safety. We're used to seeing him out on the corner. They always say cornerbacks operate on an island, and I can only assume that Tebucky's been voted off the island.'' No way Fouts would say that.</p>
        <p>But when he offers mundane football analysis, prosaic enough when uttered by traditional analysts like Fouts, it sounds extraordinarily out of place.</p>
        <p>Expectations are different for Miller, whose hiring invoked comparisons to Howard Cosell. If he is commonplace, what is his value? You want him to work on the thin edge of danger, not shovel out nuggets like: ''We talked to Mariucci last night, Danny, and he loves Ty Streets,'' or ''He's a gamer,'' or ''He's 46-3 in junior college and college, so he knows how to win.''</p>
        <p>Miller appeared to be torn between a compulsion to employ his informed fan's knowledge when he sensed an opening and finding the right moments to inject humor-laced analysis that separates him from Fouts.</p>
        <p>After a third-quarter punt return by New England's Tony Gaiter, Miller must have felt he had earned the right to sound like a veteran analyst who knows the players. Yet he sounded awkward when he said: ''You just feel so good when guys break out of the pack. There's so much competition to make these teams. A kid like Tony Gaiter must be feeling on top of the world.''</p>
        <p>And he should never find himself floating in a sea of statistics as he did when he compared 49ers receiver Jerry Rice and three Hall of Famers.</p>
        <p>But there were enough moments of promise, when the producer Don Ohlmeyer's gamble in hiring a naughty comic didn't seem crazy. Miller had enough guts to show his nervousness, to promise to smooth his ''rough edges'' and to admit that he loved the gig even if ''I might be run out of town on a rail.''</p>
        <p>How many rookie analysts would say after one play, ''I can't tell you how lost I am.''</p>
        <p>With one minute left, Miller announced that, like Don Meredith before him, he had a song to signify that a game was officially done. Miller suggested, ''Start Blow-Drying Teddy Koppel's Hair Because This One's Done.''</p>
        <p>''I just love calling him Teddy,'' Miller said. ''He hasn't been called Teddy since he was an embryo.''</p>
        <p>''Monday Night'' had other changes. Fouts is upbeat but his comments were ordinary, lacking in oomph. And the new sideline reporters Melissa Stark and Eric Dickerson didn't let anyone forget the exiled Leslie Visser. Dickerson was especially ungainly when asking questions, but that's not a surprise because he was hired without a single qualification for the job.</p>
        <p>The most completely positive debut last night was the ''umpcam,'' the tiny camera mounted on the umpire's cap. It delivered what the National Football League hoped for: visceral replays from the line of scrimmage. If it is a preseason success, it could be a full-time, regular-season toy.</p>
