        <p>Moshe Katsav, Israel's new president, is a modest, soft-spoken man who was the country's youngest mayor at 24 and has since soldiered loyally in the right-wing Likud's political trenches.</p>
        <p>Mr. Katsav, 55, was first elected to Parliament in 1977 in Menachem Begin's landslide and was referred to as ''the tolerant and polite'' legislator, a certain distinction in the often rancorous body.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, is said to have chosen him as a candidate for the largely ceremonial post because he had so few enemies. But until the stunning vote in Parliament today, not a single political pundit gave him a chance against Shimon Peres, a Nobel laureate who was twice prime minister, although never by election.</p>
        <p>''It's not easy to compete with someone like Shimon Peres,'' Mr. Katsav mused in a pre-election interview with The Jerusalem Post, whose reporter found him ''remarkably normal.'' It was the kind of regular-guy image he cultivated in his campaign.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important for Israel's domestic politics, he is a Sephardic Jew -- that is, a Jew of Middle Eastern origin -- a native of Yazd, in central Iran, who came to Israel in 1951 at the age of 5. The eldest of 10 children, he grew up in a tent camp named Qiryat Malachi, which became a working-class ''development city.''</p>
        <p>In 1969, when he was 24, its voters elected him mayor. He had by then studied economics and history at Hebrew University -- the first student from the town to attend university -- and worked briefly as a reporter for the newspaper Yediot Ahronot. He still lives in Qiryat Malachi with his wife and five children.</p>
        <p>His military service, often a crucial social and political distinction here, was similarly modest. In contrast to the war heroes, fighter-pilots, paratroopers and commandos who normally populate the upper reaches of Israeli politics, he was an ordinary soldier, serving as a tank loader and a radio operator. He once sat in jail for a week for refusing a command he thought was wrong.</p>
        <p>His strong religious connections undoubtedly helped him, winning the key votes of the 17-member Shas Party of ultra-Orthodox Sephardim. On Sunday, one of the Shas spiritual leaders, Rabbi Yitzhak Kadouri, said he had had a vision that Mr. Katsav was favored by the heavens. As a result, aides to Rabbi Kadouri, who is believed to be over 100, called legislators to urge Mr. Katsav's election.</p>
        <p>''I intend to contribute to the reduction of tensions within our society, and I will be the representative of all classes,'' Mr. Katsav said after his election. ''I call on Arabs of Israel, the religious and secular, Sephardic and Ashkenazic, to see me as their representative, their president.''</p>
