        <p>Among the speakers on this evening's program:</p>
        <p>Condoleezza Rice  Bush foreign policy adviser</p>
        <p>Condoleezza Rice is quarterback of Gov. George W. Bush's foreign policy team, whose members call themselves the Vulcans. That name, taken from the god of metalworking in Roman mythology, also reflects Ms. Rice's hometown, Birmingham, Ala., where a statue of Vulcan overlooks the city. Of the foreign policy team, Ms. Rice is the closest to Mr. Bush. He has said he feels comfortable asking her the most basic questions. Ms. Rice, 45, joined the faculty of Stanford University in 1981 and later became the youngest person to be the university's provost as well as the first woman and first nonwhite to hold the job.</p>

        <p>Elizabeth Dole  Former president of the American Red Cross</p>
        <p>A thirst for politics and a knack for leadership have made Elizabeth Dole probably the most recognized woman in the Republican Party. Her appearance at the 1996 convention when she introduced her husband, Bob Dole, was widely praised. She had placed second to Gov. George W. Bush in many polls before dropping out of the presidential race this year. A native of Salisbury, N.C., she has a political science degree from Duke and a law degree from Harvard. She married Mr. Dole, the Republican senator from Kansas, in 1975, and has held cabinet posts in two administrations. In 1999, she resigned as head of the American Red Cross to run for president.</p>
        <p>John McCain  Senator from Arizona</p>
        <p>Starting as a marginal candidate for president, John McCain emerged as a threat to Gov. George W. Bush in the primaries, attracting independents and Democrats. Before dropping out in March, he won primaries in New Hampshire and Michigan. Mr. McCain, 63, was born in the Panama Canal Zone, the son of a naval officer. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1958 and was a pilot in the Vietnam War. In 1967, his plane was shot down and he spent five and a half years as a prisoner of war. After retiring from the Navy, Mr. McCain moved to Arizona and was elected to Congress in 1982. He ran successfully for the Senate in 1986, 1992 and 1998.</p>
        <p>Patricia Funderburk Ware  Family Advocate</p>
        <p>Patricia Funderburk Ware of Raleigh, N.C., says she has seen the lifestyles that have led to teenage pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. These concerns are the focus of her work as president of the Preserving Family Well-Being Foundation, a group that addresses the problems facing black families.</p>
        <p>Theodore Roosevelt IV  Environmental Advocate</p>
        <p>The great-grandson of the 26th president, Theodore Roosevelt IV is an investment banker and an environmental advocate. A managing director at Lehman Brothers and resident of Brooklyn, he is a board member of the Hudson River Trust, which is responsible for designing, building and operating the park along the waterfront of the West Side of Manhattan.</p>
