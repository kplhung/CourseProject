        <p>When Asteroids Grow Up</p>
        <p>It is a fine line, sometimes, between fame and obscurity. Take the case of the celestial object known as 1999 UX18. One day it's an asteroid, just another bit player meandering around the solar system. The next day it's a star.</p>
        <p>Or rather, a moon. Astronomers at the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory have determined that the small object, thought to be an asteroid when it was discovered near Jupiter last year, is in fact an outer satellite of the planet.</p>
        <p>The object was one of many observed by the University of Arizona's Spacewatch program, which uses a 36-inch telescope to look for comets and asteroids. It was catalogued by the Smithsonian's Minor Planet Center and pretty much forgotten.</p>
        <p>But a staff member of the center, testing new software last month, thought he came across another observation of the object in the Spacewatch data. He tried to come up with a solar orbit for the object that would account for the various observations. When he could not, it dawned on him that perhaps he was wrongly assuming that the object was orbiting the Sun. Perhaps it was actually orbiting Jupiter.</p>
        <p>That turned out to be the case, although its orbit, like those of the other outer satellites, is highly irregular and millions of miles from the planet. And the object is so small -- about three miles in diameter, perhaps -- that it is difficult to see. But the astronomers hope to make another set of observations to confirm their finding. And if it is confirmed as a moon, 1999 UX18 will eventually get a name worthy of its billing.</p>
        <p>Undoing Fish Evolution</p>
        <p>Astyanax mexicanus, a fish found in Mexico, is an unusual creature. It exists in two forms: sightless cave dwellers that have degenerate orbs in place of eyes, and those that live in surface streams and have normal eyes. The two are thought to have diverged from a common ancestor within the past million years.</p>
        <p>Now, scientists at the University of Maryland have uncovered clues to how they evolved differently. They report in the journal Science that the eye lens plays a critical role in the development (or degeneration) of the eye.</p>
        <p>In the cave-dwelling variety, eyes begin to develop in the embryo, but the lens quickly degenerates and other eye tissues like the cornea, retina and pupil develop in only rudimentary form. But when the researchers implanted lens tissue from the sighted variety into a cave-dweller embryo, a large eye with a distinct cornea, pupil and iris developed. It is as if the researchers were able to undo a million years of evolution in one fell swoop.</p>
        <p>The researchers are conducting further experiments to determine exactly how the lens tissue sets off eye development. The work may eventually help in understanding the genetic factors behind certain forms of sight loss in humans.</p>
        <p>Those Talkative Beans</p>
        <p>It's hard to find something nice to say about lima beans, other than that they are easy to spear with a fork. But researchers in Japan have uncovered a reason the vegetable may be worthy of new respect. Limas, it turns out, are good communicators.</p>
        <p>Like some other types of plants, a lima can let its neighbors know when it has been attacked by a pest such as a spider mite. The action of the mite munching on the plant releases volatile compounds that are carried through the air to neighboring lima plants, which then prepare chemical defenses against infestation.</p>
        <p>While it had been known that limas could do this, the exact mechanism had remained unclear. The Japanese researchers, reporting in Nature, discovered that the volatile compounds activate five defense genes in an uninfested plant.</p>
        <p>What's more, the plants can differentiate between a mite infestation and physical damage that might be caused, say, by being stepped on. The compounds released by a damaged plant are ignored by its neighbors.</p>
