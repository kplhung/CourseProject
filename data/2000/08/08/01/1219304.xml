        <p>A federal civil rights agency is investigating possible discrimination against Asian and Asian-American employees at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said spokesmen for the laboratory and the University of California, which manages it.</p>
        <p>Los Alamos is the second federal weapons laboratory to come under investigation by the agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, for possible discrimination.</p>
        <p>Last year the agency began an investigation of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory after claims by nine Asian-Americans that they were subjected to bias in pay and promotions.</p>
        <p>Some Asian and Asian-American scientists at both laboratories also claim that they have been unfairly singled out as possible security risks after the arrest of Dr. Wen Ho Lee, a former Los Alamos scientist who has been charged with mishandling nuclear data. Dr. Lee is a naturalized citizen originally from Taiwan.</p>
        <p>Both laboratories are managed by the University of California under a contract with the Energy Department.</p>
        <p>Rick Malaspina, a university spokesman, confirmed the investigation and said both the laboratory and the university would cooperate.</p>
        <p>''Needless to say, we do not tolerate discrimination or profiling,'' Mr. Malaspina said.</p>
        <p>While a commission spokesman would not comment on specific investigations, he said that in general, legal action could result if evidence of discrimination were found, and if the institution being investigated declined to accept the remedies that the commission proposed.</p>
        <p>The legal office at Los Alamos recently sent a memorandum to about 350 current and former Asian and Asian-American employees of the laboratory, informing them of the investigation ''alleging discrimination against Asian and Asian-American employees.''</p>
        <p>Kevin Roark, a spokesman for Los Alamos, said California law, which governs the university's operations, required the laboratory to inform its employees that as part of the investigation the commission had requested information from their personnel files on matters like their ethnicity and place of residence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roark said that because the commission had not yet revealed the specific accusations it was investigating, the laboratory could not comment on the action.</p>
