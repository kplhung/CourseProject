        <p>JUST as the curiosity of Sherlock Holmes was piqued by the dog that did not bark, Madison Avenue is wondering about the party that is not being thrown.</p>
        <p>The party is known as Advertising New York, an annual benefit event held since 1994 under the sponsorship of three organizations well known in the agency industry: the Advertising Club of New York, Advertising Women of New York and the American Advertising Federation. The popular event, typically held in June at Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan, has drawn more than a thousand attendees each year to buy tickets to elaborate food tastings featuring celebrity chefs from agencies, client companies and the media.</p>
        <p>Profits after expenses have been donated to the charitable and educational programs sponsored by the foundations of the three organizations. Typically, each event yielded an estimated profit of $100,000, said Wally Snyder, president and chief executive of the advertising federation in Washington.</p>
        <p>This year, however, June has come and gone without the party taking place -- and therefore without the money being raised. Also missing this year were the annual honors named the Good Egg Awards that had been presented in connection with the event. The awards, meant to promote corporate citizenship, had been part of the event since 1996.</p>
        <p>While there has been no shortage this year of awards or parties in the New York advertising world, primarily because of the ad spending boom, people became curious when there was no word about Advertising New York, which has also gone by the name Ad Day in New York.</p>
        <p>So what happened? The answer is not quite elementary, my dear Watson, but more a result of a combination of circumstances.</p>
        <p>First off, it turns out that a committee formed by the three organizations to coordinate Ad Day met in December 1999 and decided not to hold it in 2000 and form a task force to rethink the event.</p>
        <p>''The collective judgment was to step back a year and take a breath,'' Mr. Snyder said, ''to see how it could be refocused and what more we could be doing.''</p>
        <p>''It was a great program and I loved it,'' he added, ''but it's a big effort.''</p>
        <p>Ellen Flahive, president at the women's advertising organization, said: ''Ad Day has always served as an important fund-raiser, but I can't think of a recipe for a fund-raiser that you can repeat year in and year out. Advertising is a business that prides itself on the new, the different, the cutting edge. People like change and new things.'' Ms. Flahive is also publisher at the American Park Network in New York, part of the Meredith Corporation.</p>
        <p>''The enthusiasm has died down,'' agreed Frank Ginsberg, chairman, chief executive and creative director at Avrett, Free &amp; Ginsberg in New York, who has been one of the most ardent supporters of the event.</p>
        <p>One reason, Mr. Ginsberg said, is that because ''the business is booming,'' there get to be ''so many events where you can get together with your peers.'' Another reason he gave was that as the years went by, fewer people seemed familiar with the purpose of the event, leading to perceptions it was just another social affair or schmooze-a-thon.</p>
        <p>''People were asking what all the booths with food at Rockefeller Center were there for,'' Mr. Ginsberg said. ''It wasn't clear.'' Avrett, Free is part of the Bozell Group unit of True North Communications.</p>
        <p>As enthusiasm flagged, there was also a change in the composition of the crowds, particularly the volunteers who agreed to be chefs. (The chefs, including this columnist, did not actually cook food but stood by as caterers served the dishes and talked with the attendees who bought tickets to the event.)</p>
        <p>''In the beginning, we got the top people in the industry to come,'' said Brett Caldwell, director for events and programs at the advertising club. ''We're trying to restructure and rebuild it, to make it the way it was.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Snyder at the advertising federation said that he too hoped ''there would be more C.E.O.'s'' from the agencies attending as well as ''more clients.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the advertising club is planning to become the sponsor of the Good Egg Awards. A committee has been formed, Mr. Caldwell said, whose members anticipate resuming the presentations in summer 2001.</p>
        <p>Will there be an Ad Day to accompany an awards presentation when the Good Eggs are revived? As the saying goes, stay tuned.</p>
