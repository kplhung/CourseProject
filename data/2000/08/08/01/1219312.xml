        <p>Dick Cheney, the Republican choice for vice president, kept it short, sweet and subdued for a second day today in what is becoming his hallmark at the party's national convention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, a former congressman from Wyoming, met with his state's Republican delegation at a private breakfast, and then won cheers from delegates when he and his wife, Lynne, entered the First Union Center today to attend about an hour of the opening events.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, a former secretary of defense, spent most of the day working on the speech he is scheduled to give on Wednesday night. Aides said he was writing it himself, but would not discuss the themes. Mr. Cheney returned to the convention hall tonight to hear speeches from Gen. Colin L. Powell, his close friend and a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Laura Bush, the wife of Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>In a brief interview with CNN on the convention floor, Mr. Cheney defended his conservative voting record in Congress, which had been criticized repeatedly by Vice President Al Gore's campaign in the last week. ''I don't think it has much impact,'' said Mr. Cheney, who appeared on all five Sunday news programs to counter Democratic charges that his votes against the Head Start education program, a ban on armor-piercing bullets and some environmental protection measures were the mark of an extremist.</p>
        <p>The partisan barbs failed to matter to delegates here, who are more conservative than most registered Republicans. ''I'm not going to say I agree with 100 percent of his positions, but, over all, I'm impressed with Cheney and his experience,'' said Beth Welbers, 41, an alternate delegate from Spring Valley, Ill.</p>
        <p>Old friends and political allies from Wyoming provided support at Mr. Cheney's opening rally on Sunday, and the Wyoming delegates' breakfast this morning was held aboard ceremonial rail cars of the Union Pacific, for which he was a director.</p>
        <p>''We're here in Philadelphia now, and we have a tremendous opportunity,'' Mr. Cheney told the cheering delegation. ''We've been to seven or eight conventions now, and I've never seen such a united party.''</p>
        <p>The railroad setting evoked strong memories for Mr. Cheney. He recalled that while growing up in Nebraska, he spent vacations with his grandfather, a Union Pacific cook who lived on a rail car that followed the work crews.</p>
        <p>''If you were a kid, 7 or 8 years old,'' Mr. Cheney said, ''there was nothing more romantic in those days than living in a railroad car.''</p>
