        <p>John McMullen said yesterday he feels confident that Puck Holdings, an affiliate of the Yankee-Nets, will complete its $175 million acquisition of his Devils by Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>''They'll lose $30 million if they don't do it,'' he said, referring to the ''breakup fee'' due him from Puck if the deal collapses.</p>
        <p>He called Aug. 31 ''the dor-or-die date.''</p>
        <p>During a news conference at ''21'' where the Devils' Stanley Cup made a tour stop, McMullen said the buyers ''are making every effort.'' But he said it would be easy to take over the team if the acquisition falls apart.</p>
        <p>''By that time, the season will be ready to start, we have our roster stablilized and the team will be ready to go,'' he said, adding that if Puck Falters, he would not seek another buyer. ''Then it's over,'' he said.</p>
        <p>McMullen revealed that in exchange for deferring an unspecified amount of the $175 million purchase price, he would be a part-owner for three years.</p>
        <p>Puck's purchase of the team was scheduled to close July 12, but it has been postponed to as late as Aug. 31 pending National Hockey League approval of six to eight investors. Puck was formed by Ray Chambers and Lewis Katz, two investors in YankeeNets, which would be the general partner of the Devils.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of paperwork,'' McMullen said.</p>
        <p>RICHARD SANDOMIR  CAROLINA SIGNS HATCHER: After a shaky season with the Rangers, the five-time All-Star Kevin Hatcher is headed to his third team in three years. The Carolina Hurricanes signed the free-agent defenseman yesterday.</p>
        <p>Hatcher, who turns 34 in September, failed to support the offensive defenseman Brian Leetch in New York last season, managing just 4 goals and 19 assists with a plus-minus of minus-10 in 74 games. The Rangers acquired Hatcher from the Pittsburgh Penguins last September for defenseman Peter Popovic.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)  RENNEY NAMED PERSONNEL DIRECTOR:Tom Renney, who coached the Canadian national team last season and is a former coach of the Vancouver Canucks, was named by the Rangers yesterday as their player personnel director. He will oversee the team's amateur scouting and will assist in the scouting of pro players.</p>
