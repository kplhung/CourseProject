        <p>Justice Department antitrust prosecutors investigating Christie's and Sotheby's won a court order yesterday postponing the taking of testimony in a civil suit against the giant auction houses until at least Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>The government had argued that the questioning of witnesses in the civil case could prejudice its criminal investigation.</p>
        <p>Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of United States District Court in Manhattan granted the delay while calling the motion ''troublesome'' and saying that prosecutors had made ''no showing as to why the investigation has not been concluded.''</p>
        <p>But Judge Kaplan, who is hearing the civil class-action suit brought by several hundred disgruntled buyers and sellers who contend that they were cheated by collusive practices, said he wanted to avoid any risk of prejudicing the federal investigation.</p>
        <p>Still, he said that if the government were to seek a further stay,  ''it will have to make a substantially more persuasive case than it did on this occasion.''</p>
        <p>The Justice Department had also asked to seal the papers it submitted with its arguments, a motion that Judge Kaplan called puzzling because the papers had already been served on lawyers in the case. The judge ordered them sealed through Aug. 8.</p>
        <p>Lawyers and others close to the investigation said last week that discussions between the government and lawyers for Diana D. Brooks, the former chief executive and president of Sotheby's, had intensified over efforts to secure her testimony as a cooperating witness against Sotheby's former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman. Both resigned in February.</p>
