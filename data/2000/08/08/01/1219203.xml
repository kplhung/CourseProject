        <p>For would-be Lasik patients, there is unfortunately no way to compare the results of different surgeons. The gushing testimonial of a friend may be misleading: Lasik's results are so good that the majority of patients of any surgeon will be happy with the outcome.</p>
        <p>Many experts recommend asking surgeons, ''How many Lasik procedures have you done?'' Some studies have indicated that, on average, a surgeon's rate of complications drops over the course of the first 300 or so Lasik procedures.</p>

        <p>For would-be Lasik patients, there is unfortunately no way to compare the results of different surgeons. The gushing testimonial of a friend may be misleading: Lasik's results are so good that the majority of patients of any surgeon will be happy with the outcome.</p>
        <p>Many experts recommend asking surgeons, ''How many Lasik procedures have you done?'' Some studies have indicated that, on average, a surgeon's rate of complications drops over the course of the first 300 or so Lasik procedures.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Marc Odrich, director of refractive surgery at Columbia University and medical director of the laser manufacturer VISX, says he believes newer flap-cutting keratomes have smoothed out the learning curve.</p>
        <p>He suggests these questions for Lasik surgeons:</p>
        <p>*What is the ''enhancement'' rate, that is, what percentage of patients require a second surgery to fine-tune the prescription? ''I think that tells you how careful they are with the initial work-up and the refraction they are getting,'' Dr. Odrich said.</p>
        <p>*What percentage of people do you turn away? ''If the answer is almost nobody, that would give me concern,'' Dr. Odrich said. ''I think that's the hardest part of the procedure: the judgment. There are lots of patients who are better off not having the surgery.'' Conditions that could rule out patients include thin corneas, past herpes infections in the eyes, diabetes and unrealistic expectations.</p>
        <p>*For people over 40, do you recommend monovision? With monovision, one eye is left somewhat nearsighted, postponing or eliminating the need for reading glasses. If so, ask the doctor if a trial with contact lenses is offered.</p>
        <p>*What complications have you had and how have they turned out? There are two ways that a doctor can avoid complications. ''No. 1 is you're lying,'' Dr. Odrich said, ''and way No. 2 is you've stopped operating.'' What is more telling is how the surgeon handled the complications.</p>
