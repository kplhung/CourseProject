        <p>It seems like an odd recruiting strategy in a tight labor market: tell prospective employees that they can expect to work longer hours and receive fewer perks than they would at rival companies. But that is precisely what a large Washington law firm will announce today as it tries to redefine the summer-associate program that virtually all firms use to woo law students.</p>
        <p>Howrey Simon Arnold &amp; White, which has a roster of blue-chip clients that includes Intel, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble, is scrapping its traditional program -- in which law students spend the summer doing relatively little work, going out for expensive meals and still getting paid more than $2,000 a week. In its place will be a ''boot camp'' in which the potential employees will work 12 hours a day for two weeks on a mock trial, as well as a two-week stint in one of Howrey's six offices around the country.</p>
        <p>Partners at Howrey said they hoped the new program would give young lawyers a more accurate picture of life at a law firm than a summer of free baseball and theater tickets does. That in turn could reduce turnover, which has been rising at most large firms as many associates have taken advantage of the tight labor market and have left behind law-firm work that can resemble drudgery in the first few years for jobs at consulting firms, Internet start-ups and big companies.</p>
        <p>''Everyone is looking for ways to make sure people really understand the life of an associate,'' said Janet Zagorin, the director of practice development at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, another big firm. Howrey's new summer program ''is a very, very interesting idea; it's very different.''</p>
        <p>It also brings some significant risks for Howrey, the 74th-largest firm in the country, according to American Lawyer magazine, and one that focuses on antitrust and intellectual-property litigation. The firm is both cutting perquisites for law students who have dozens of options in a good economy and encouraging them to spend the majority of their summer at another firm that will try to hire them.</p>
        <p>Howrey will mail letters to law students and deans today announcing the change, lawyers at the firm said. It will take effect next year.</p>
        <p>Law school officials and lawyers at other firms said they did not know whether Howrey's idea would spread, but they called it one of the most notable changes in years to the summer-associate program, which is the most important recruiting tool for firms. Each large firm hires dozens of law students, most of them entering their third and final year of school, for two or three months. Partners and associates then spend much of the time trying to persuade the students to join the firm after graduation.</p>
        <p>Howrey's move is also one of the most dramatic illustrations of the ways that law firms are scrambling to respond to raises given to associates earlier this year in an effort to reduce turnover. The pay increases -- lifting the salaries of first-year associates at the nation's largest firms to $125,000, from $100,000 -- have drastically raised firms' costs, causing many to consider eliminating some practice areas or hiring less expensive outside lawyers to do more basic work.</p>
        <p>Howrey's summer program will save it about $700,000 in direct costs, and the firm plans to spend some of that money on new training programs for associates, said Richard Ripley, a partner who oversees the firm's recruiting committee.</p>
        <p>The recent pay increases have also raised the stakes for holding onto lawyers for more than a few years. The largest increases went to the least experienced lawyers at most firms, making fourth-year and fifth-year associates more profitable for firms than their less experienced colleagues with lower billing rates.</p>
        <p>But Howrey has had the same kind of retention problems as many firms. In June, for example, a lawyer who had quit the firm sent an anonymous letter to its partners and associates with a long list of complaints. The ''associates are either leaving like rats from a sinking ship or are grumbling about how unhappy they are,'' said the memo, which was passed along by e-mail to dozens of lawyers at other firms.</p>
        <p>With a summer program intended to mimic the kind of work more experienced lawyers perform, Howrey partners said they hoped to cut down on the number of associates who leave during their first or second year, bored by the long hours and the kind of work that occupies their time then.</p>
        <p>''The problem with the summer-associate programs is that the bulk of the work that can be effectively done during this very short period of time is library research,'' said Edward Han, a Howrey partner. ''Beyond the first year or two of practice, our actual associates don't do that.''</p>
        <p>For its two-week boot camp, Howrey will rent a corporate retreat in Leesburg, Va., where its 50 summer associates and some lawyers from the firm will spend two weeks. The law students will split into two teams of opposing lawyers for the mock trial. They then will depose ''witnesses'' -- played by Howrey employees -- receiving critiques from the firm's actual lawyers, for example.</p>
        <p>During the remaining two weeks, the law students will spread out across the country and go through a shorter version of the typical summer-associate program.</p>
        <p>The students will receive $12,000 for the four-week program, which will end in mid-June. The salary is about $500 a week more than summer associates at other firms receive. But because many students have large law-school debts, they are likely to spend the rest of their summer at other firms. ''If you work for 10 weeks, you pay for a year of law school,'' said W. Stevenson Hopson, the career services dean at the University of Virginia School of Law, which sent four of its graduates to Howrey this spring.</p>
        <p>As a result, Howrey Simon may have a lower acceptance rate than other firms because nearly all of its summer associates will be weighing more than one job offer, Mr. Hopson added.</p>
        <p>Howrey partners said they realized the risk but expected the lawyers who did accept offers to have a solid understanding of their new employer. ''We're thinking that by making a better fit, we will improve our retention,'' Mr. Han said.</p>
