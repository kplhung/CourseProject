        <p>The Liberty zipped behind-the-back passes, spoon-fed each other on the fast break and dropped 3-pointers as if there were no defense to beat.</p>
        <p>There barely was last night in Madison Square Garden, but this game had little to do with the Charlotte Sting.</p>
        <p>Synchronized and smiling, the Liberty has the rhythm these days, rolling toward the Women's National Basketball Association playoffs as surely as Charlotte is trudging toward a merciful end of the season.</p>
        <p>The Liberty, leading Cleveland by two and a half games in the Eastern Conference, clinched its second consecutive playoff berth with an 81-56 victory over the visiting Sting. It collected its 11th victory in 12 games, its fifth straight. And for the third time in four games, forward Vickie Johnson led the team in scoring. She produced 20 points in a game resembling a basketball clinic. ''It's so much fun to play now,'' Johnson said. ''I can't wait until the next game.''</p>
        <p>No wonder. After finishing the first half of the season at 7-9, the Liberty (18-10) quickly built the best record in the conference, with four games left in the regular season.</p>
        <p>The attitudes and the results both changed after the Liberty lost in overtime to Cleveland on July 3 to end the first half of the season. The team returned the next day and, on the holiday, went straight to practice.</p>
        <p>Point guard Teresa Weatherspoon led a team meeting. ''We came back off the plane,'' she said, ''and the first I said was, 'You're going to have to find your spirit, we're going to have to find it together.' And from that point on, we found it.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty found it on defense first, launching fast breaks off aggressive rebounding. ''Everybody is taking pride in our defense,'' Johnson said. ''Now we're not afraid to pressure the ball, we're going to the boards hard and, as a result, we're getting a lot of easy baskets.''</p>
        <p>Last night, in front of an announced crowd of 15,259, the Liberty demonstrated Johnson's point as the opening 15 minutes offered a clear contrast of the best and worst teams in the conference. While the Liberty players were hugging and high-fiving, their opponents were struggling.</p>
        <p>The Liberty quickly led by 30-10, hitting four 3-pointers and running the floor with abandon. Although the Liberty let a 21-point lead slip to 15 points at the half, the players returned for the second half determined to play stingy defense. With 11 minutes remaining in the game, the Liberty built the lead back to 22.</p>
        <p>Liberty Coach Richie Adubato played other substitutes besides the first-round draft pick Olga Firsova. Center Marina Ferragut scored 9 points in five minutes.</p>
        <p>Andrea Stinson scored 18 points to lead the Sting (7-21).</p>
        <p>The Liberty, which won by its largest margin of the season, has a record eight straight victories at home.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is to win the Eastern Conference, and it's within our realm,'' Adubato said.</p>
