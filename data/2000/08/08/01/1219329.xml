        <p>Following are excerpts from remarks delivered last night at the Republican National Convention by Conna Craig, Elaine L. Chao and Sharon Darling as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>Remarks by Ms. Craig</p>
        <p>A stadium twice the size of this convention center could not hold all the children legally free for adoption tonight and waiting for families.</p>
        <p>I understand the wait. I was a foster child for eight years. Then the Craig family adopted me and gave me a last name.</p>
        <p>In memory of my dad, Joe Craig, I established the Institute for Children. The institute works with policy makers to remove the bureaucratic obstacles that force children to languish in foster care. We work with governors to create a more humane, efficient, loving child welfare system.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush understands the needs of children in foster care. His achievements in Texas demonstrate his commitment to real, lasting change.</p>
        <p>The time children in Texas spend waiting for adoption has been cut nearly in half during the past decade. . . .</p>
        <p>Governor Bush knows what my father who adopted me, Joe Craig, knew. Children deserve more than promises, more than programs. Every child should grow up in a permanent, loving family.</p>
        <p>Remarks by Ms. Chao</p>
        <p>Many years ago my parents . . . left a homeland torn by war and instability. I was a child when my father went ahead to make a life for us in America. And it took three long years before he could bring us to this country. . . .</p>
        <p>Now I don't have to tell you our early years in America were really tough. My father held three jobs to make ends meet and my mother worried over our meager budget. . . .</p>
        <p>The story of my family is not unique. It's a story shared by millions of immigrants to America that continues to unfold in communities across our great country every single day. . . .</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush knows the great contribution that immigrants made to America and he appreciates that America's richness comes from its diverse heritage, individual initiative, the bonds of family and community and God's grace.</p>
        <p>But you know, too often new immigrants are not welcomed with open arms but instead are confronted with long lines and a bureaucracy that views them with indifference, or worse, suspicion.</p>
        <p>Well, as president, George W. Bush will change the character of the I.N.S. He will make America more welcoming to immigrants. He will restructure the I.N.S., splitting it into two agencies, one for service and one for enforcement, expediting paperwork and protecting our borders.</p>
        <p>Remarks by Ms. Darling</p>
        <p>Literacy and the Bush family are practically synonymous. Barbara Bush for her exceptional contributions is known as the first lady of literacy.</p>
        <p>Governor George W. Bush implemented a program that dramatically improved reading scores for school children in Texas.</p>
        <p>Laura Bush, an educator in her own right, has spearheaded a successful statewide family literacy initiative in Texas.</p>
        <p>Even Millie, the Bush family dog, rose to literary stardom. . . .</p>
        <p>As president, George W. Bush will launch Reading First, a $5 billion initiative aimed at conquering illiteracy among disadvantaged children and teaching every child to read at grade level by third grade.</p>
        <p>It's an ambitious goal, but one that we must strive for . . . if we are to leave no child behind and more importantly, no family behind.</p>
