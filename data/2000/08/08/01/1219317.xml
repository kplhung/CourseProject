        <p>Two longtime executives at 20th Century Fox were named today to share the job of running the movie studio, succeeding Bill Mechanic, who resigned in June.</p>
        <p>Jim Gianopulos, who has been president of the studio's international distribution division since 1994, will join Tom Rothman, the president of the 20th Century Fox Film Group and a longtime production executive, as co-chairman of the movie studio, said Peter Chernin, president of the News Corporation, the studio's parent company.</p>
        <p>''These jobs are so big and so complicated right now that having two people to share it is good for both of them,'' Mr. Chernin said. ''I did a lot of work, both inside the company and around town, looking to fill this position and what I finally came to feel was that I have not just one but two extraordinary individuals right here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rothman and Mr. Gianopulos said today that while their movie careers had differed in emphasis -- Mr. Rothman has more of a creative and production background and Mr. Gianopulos more of a concentration in distribution and the business side -- they intended to fully share the duties of running the studio.</p>
        <p>''The reason Jim and I are as optimistic as we are is that we are a neat fit in that way,'' Mr. Rothman said. ''We're both long in the tooth in this business and between us have covered all aspects of it, but to be honest we do have more intensive experience in different areas.''</p>
        <p>However, the two executives will not be rigid about dividing up the duties, they said.</p>
        <p>''We will work together on the big decisions and share in each other's areas as much as we can,'' Mr. Rothman said. ''But there will be that primacy in the areas that we each have our respective expertise in. The idea is for this to be very much of a partnership.''</p>
        <p>The resignation of Mr. Mechanic, a widely respected and well-liked executive, caught much of Hollywood by surprise in June.</p>
        <p>The studio had been having a sour run at the box office, from last fall's ''Fight Club'' to ''Anna and the King'' to this summer's animated ''Titan A.E.'' But the resignation came right after the unexpected box office success of ''Big Momma's House'' and just before the release of ''Me, Myself and Irene'' and ''X-Men,'' which both did well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rothman said he expected no significant changes. A look at the movies the studio has released this summer is a good indication of the kinds of films the two executives intend to release in the future. He pointed, in particular, to alliances the studio had made with filmmakers like George Lucas, James Cameron, Robert Zemeckis and Tim Burton.</p>
        <p>''For us, I think originality is the keyword,'' Mr. Rothman said.</p>
        <p>''And diversity,'' Mr. Gianopulos added.</p>
        <p>The studio, they said, will continue to shy away from selling international distribution rights to foreign companies, as many studios do, and may even buy more foreign distribution rights to films produced by other studios -- perhaps even by DreamWorks, whose international distribution deal with Universal Pictures is about to expire.</p>
        <p>''The two core agendas of our parent company are the hunger for content and the ability to distribute it in many different ways on many different platforms, and an international emphasis in general,'' Mr. Gianopulos said. ''This creates for us a global perspective, and those continue to be our core strategies.''</p>
