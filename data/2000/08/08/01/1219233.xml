        <p>When the gurus of high fashion came here from all over the world a few weeks ago for a peek at MorumbiFashion, Brazil's biggest and most prestigious fashion show, they were wondering if this was the industry's next international capital.</p>
        <p>Brazil's textile and garment industries are hoping the answer is yes. But in a country still known largely as an exporter of goods made with cheap manual labor, questions remain about whether the Brazilians can transform this new international attention into something sustainable.</p>
        <p>''Now is the time for us to show to the world that we are offering products of high quality, competitive price, good design and beauty, and with all the characteristics of Brazil,'' said Paulo Skaf, the president of the Brazilian Textile Association, a trade group.</p>
        <p>One thing is certain: Brazilian fashion is hot. It started with the meteoric success of a 19-year-old supermodel, Gisele Bundchen, who was Vogue's model of the year in 1999. In four years, Ms. Bundchen has landed on the cover of more than 250 magazines and paraded down 1,600 catwalks, bringing international attention to the concept of ''Brazilian-ness.'' Evidence of the trend in the United States includes shrinking bikinis and the caipirinha, the potent lime-and-cachaca cocktail that has become the drink of choice in some Manhattan night spots.</p>
        <p>At the same time, such Brazilian designers as Alexandre Herchcovitch and Icarius are gaining cachet on the world fashion circuit. Both have been asked to participate in the ready-to-wear fashion week in Paris in October, while Mr. Herchcovitch has already been seen on the catwalks of London.</p>
        <p>The confluence of the Gisele phenomenon and the growing success of Brazilian designers abroad has been called the Brazilian Moment in this country. But the country's garment industry is working to make sure that the moment never ends.</p>
        <p>''Brazil is all about the sensual -- tropical, Latino, Carnival, sports, women, sex,'' said Nelson Alvarenga Filho, the founder and president of the Brazilian label Ellus. ''It's entertaining, and people always need a little entertainment. That will never go out of fashion.''</p>
        <p>One look down the local equivalent of Madison Avenue -- Rua Oscar Freire in the Jardins neighborhood of Sao Paulo -- would indicate that Brazil is on the right track. Boutiques selling both Brazilian and international fashion are springing up along the most fashionable 10-block stretch, and have spilled into adjacent avenues.</p>
        <p>But while Sao Paulo may be turning into the fashion capital of Latin America, Brazil still has a long way to go to break out of its mold as a source of cheap labor and become an international fashion exporter. Only a handful of the best-known Brazilian designers have landed in stores in the United States and Europe so far, and the $18 billion industry remains dominated by small businesses that lack the resources to expand and export.</p>
        <p>''Exports of garments over the past years have been around $200 million, which is about zero point nothing of world trade,'' said Leda Oliveira, the director of foreign trade at the Brazilian Apparel Association. ''We plan to get to $1 billion by 2003, though. Put that in writing, and I'll sign it.''</p>
        <p>One of the apparel association's first steps has been to organize the country's small and medium-sized apparel businesses into regional consortiums to attract more attention from national and international buyers. The effort seems to be working. Aided by a favorable exchange rate, garment exports were up 33 percent in the first five months of the year, compared with 1999.</p>
        <p>And the Brazilian Textile Association has sought to take advantage of the popularity of Brazilian-created fashion to strengthen its industry. It has publicized plans by textile manufacturers to spend more than $12 billion on modern machinery over the next several years.</p>
        <p>The textile association is a co-sponsor of the MorumbiFashion show, and in June it held the country's first annual Brazilian fashion awards, with Ms. Bundchen receiving the award for model of the year. The textile association is also organizing a show of Brazilian designers later in the year in a European city not yet selected.</p>
