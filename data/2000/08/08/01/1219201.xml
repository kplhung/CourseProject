        <p>Dr Lawrence E Gilbert of University of Texas describes evolutionary relationship between passion flower vine of tropical forests of South and Central America and the heliconius butterfly, which feeds as a caterpillar on the leaves of the vine, which contain cyanide-laden chemicals; says heliconian has a brain twice as large of normal lepidoptera and has learned to digest pollen of the forest cucumber plant; says a male will sometimes perch on a pupa in order to impregnate the emerging female and will even probe into the pupa and fertilize her there; photos (M)</p>

        <p>The rap sheet could scarcely be more shocking. Poisoning with cyanide. Cannibalism. Molestation of minors. But wait, there are extenuating circumstances. The perpetrator is highly intelligent, with a brain more than twice as large as normal. He is remarkably elegant, if that's an excuse. He leads an unusually industrious life. And he is not a party to this society's moral code, being but a butterfly with perhaps one of his own.</p>
        <p>Heliconius butterflies live in the tropical forests of Central and South America aside from one species, Heliconius zebra, which has taken a liking to Florida. The adults have distinctive rounded wings with colorful stripes. Most butterflies fly at full speed to escape predators. But heliconians saunter from flower to flower, flaunting their bright hues, as if they hadn't an enemy in the world. The adult butterflies favor flowers known as forest cucumbers but as caterpillars they feed on the leaves of a family of vines that produce one of the most gorgeous flowers next to orchids, the passion flowers.</p>
        <p>In the forest, everything that is strikingly beautiful is sinister. The creatures that dare display themselves have hidden defenses. The Heliconius butterflies can afford to be nonchalant because their tissues are stuffed with cyanide.</p>
        <p>A curious fact is that the passion vines on which they feed are also packed with cyanide-laden chemicals known as cyanogens, although of a different kind than the cyanogens the butterflies make. As soon as hungry mouths start chewing the vine's leaves, its cells release an enzyme that breaks out the cyanide. Cyanide is a universal poison that interferes with cells' respiration.</p>
        <p>A common interest in the poisoner's art is just one of many links that bind the insect and the vine together. Dr. Lawrence E. Gilbert of the University of Texas, has been studying Heliconius and passion flowers since 1969 and has explored many features of their interactive biology. He and two colleagues, Dr. Helene S. Engler and Dr. Kevin C. Spencer, have now begun to work out the chemical interaction between the two. They reported in Nature last month that one species of the butterfly, Heliconius sara, can convert the principal cyanogen of its food plant to a source of nutrition.</p>
        <p>Biologists suspect that the vigorous interaction between the vine and the butterfly over millions of years may have been a driving force in each group's evolution. There are some 600 species of passion vine in the New World, and 40 species of Heliconius. It may be that the vines diversified first, buttressed by their cyanide defense mechanism against the usual plant eaters.</p>
        <p>Then the butterflies broke the cyanide code and found they had a rich range of food plants more or less to themselves. ''The standard pattern is that a plant develops a novel chemical defense and does well for a while, diversifying, and then some lucky group of insects is able to overcome that defense, which allows them to undergo a parallel radiation,'' said Dr. Andrew V. Z. Brower, an entomologist at Oregon State University.</p>
        <p>Even though its prime defense was breached by the butterfly, the passion vines fought back in other ways. Dr. Gilbert has found their leaves are very variable in shape, as if to disguise themselves from hunting heliconians.</p>
        <p>Most remarkably, some species of vine have developed a defense system of faux eggs. Female butterflies, if they see what appears to be an egg on a new stem, will avoid it and lay elsewhere. The false eggs, essentially yellow bumps on a leaf, exploit a dark feature of Heliconius butterfly: its caterpillars are cannibals. Since they eat only the vine's young shoots, which are large enough to support only one larva to maturity, the first caterpillar to hatch will eat all the other eggs on its shoot.</p>
        <p>The vines have developed the faux eggs by adapting another defense mechanism, nectar-dispensing glands that encourage ants to take up residence on the leaves and repel intruders.</p>
        <p>The vines may be smart but the heliconians, to hear Dr. Gilbert describing his favorite insect, are veritable Einsteins among lepidoptera. Most butterflies lead what may seem pretty pointless lives: they munch away furiously as caterpillars, hoping to turn into pupae before birds or the dreaded ichneumon wasp discover them, but live just a few days as adults. Apart from sipping nectar, they are incapable of feeding.</p>
        <p>The heliconians have transcended this pointless life through a simple but revolutionary advance. The butterflies have learned to feed on pollen by sucking it into their tongues and secreting an enzyme that digests the nutritious grains. This means they can live for months. It also allows them to transfer much feeding effort forward from the vulnerable caterpillar stage to adulthood.</p>
        <p>If they can find enough pollen, female butterflies will keep laying eggs until their skin and wings fray. Not for heliconians the nectar-sex-and-hedonism routine of other butterflies. These are busy insects. They stake out home territories, which they patrol every day, checking out every vine in the neighborhood. The females look for any new shoots produced by the passion vines. Both sexes search for the brief-lived flowers of another sort of vine, the forest cucumber, which provides the pollen.</p>
        <p>''They are very effective at learning their habitat,'' Dr. Gilbert said. ''Pollen feeding gives them a long life span, so once they find a host plant they can relocate it. You see Heliconius butterflies cruise in as if they know exactly where they are going. So we'll see the same individual butterfly checking out the same host plant for months.''</p>
        <p>Though no one knows too much about the organization of insect brains, Heliconines have a larger than usual ''mushroom body,'' a region of the brain thought to be involved with memory.</p>
        <p>The male butterflies have put their minds to at least one reprehensible purpose -- cradle-snatching. They have even invented to a new crime, which might be called cradle rape.  The butterflies are so eager to find mates that they locate female pupae and perch on them, sometimes four males to a pupa, until the female emerges, obliged in her first instants of adult life to manage mating at the same time as she is trying to unfurl her wings.</p>
        <p>Some species of heliconians have taken this aggressive suitorship to a further extreme: they probe into the pupa and fertilize the female before she has even emerged. These attentions are lethal for females of heliconian species that do not practice pupal mating, and have the useful result of preventing other species from sharing the same food plant.</p>
        <p>Pollen feeding has been exploited by heliconians for more than just nutrition. Long ago, maybe, the butterflies learned how to convert the amino acids from the digested pollen into chemicals known as aliphatic cyanogens. Dr. Spencer, a plant toxin chemist who is now senior scientific adviser for the Safeway supermarket chain in Britain, said this might  have been the breakthrough that enabled the butterflies to feed on the otherwise poisonous passion vines. In developing their own cyanogen metabolism, they were somehow able to neutralize the different kind of cyanogens produced by the vines, Dr. Spencer suggested.</p>
        <p>If so, this may explain another key step in the butterfly's evolutionary past, its development of mimicry.  The heliconians may first have mimicked a poisonous species in a related family of butterflies without being poisonous themselves, an imitation known as Batesian mimicry.</p>
        <p>Once they learned how to brew cyanide from pollen, they made their own tissues toxic and developed the higher art of Mullerian mimicry, in which poisonous species resemble one another. Many Heliconine species exist as pairs that mimic one another. The presumed advantage of Mullerian mimicry is that fewer individuals are expended in teaching predators the virtues of avoidance.</p>
        <p>While evolving the narcissistic art of mimicking one another, the heliconians have also been engaged in a furious evolutionary arms race with the passion vines. The vines have evolved a witch's brew of different cyanogens to fend off the butterflies, and each new chemical may have required the heliconians to develop a new stratagem to cope with it. One species of passion vine, Passiflora auriculata, produces no fewer than five different cyanogens, a perilous cocktail for the caterpillars of Heliconius sara, the species that has learned how to eat the plant.</p>
        <p>Dr. Engler has now found that the caterpillars can detoxify the principle cyanogen, a complex chemical called epivolkenin, and convert its cyanide into useful nitrogen. Each step in this intricate chemical battle, Dr. Spencer says, has evolved as a tit-for-tat escalation between each species of heliconian and the passion vine species that is its host plant.  This relentless chemical warfare may have been a factor in the present profusion of species on each side.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gilbert, who has spent 30 years studying the visible biology of the Heliconines and passion vines, hopes a whole new level of interaction will emerge from study of the chemistry and genetics of the system.</p>
