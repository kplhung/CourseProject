        <p>It is no longer routine, as it was in the 1950's, for children to have their tonsils removed to prevent persistent infections. But for the estimated 500,000 Americans who still do undergo tonsillectomies each year, one thing has not changed: the procedure is a painful one that leaves people with difficulty swallowing for up to two weeks.</p>
        <p>Now, Somnus Medical Technologies, a small medical device company in Sunnyvale, Calif., has won Food and Drug Administration approval for an alternative to tonsillectomy it claims will be less painful and allow for a quicker recovery. The idea is to shrink the tonsils rather than cut them out.</p>
        <p>But experts caution that the technique is still highly experimental and not likely to be widely adopted until more testing is done.</p>
        <p>Tonsillectomies hurt because they leave a raw surface exposed after the tonsils are cut out. A small percentage of patients suffer from dehydration, because they cannot swallow for days, or from postoperative bleeding. While newer techniques, like use of a laser instead of a knife, have been developed for removing tonsils, they have not done much to reduce pain or recovery time because they still leave a surface exposed.</p>
        <p>Somnus's technique involves inserting tiny needle electrodes into the tonsils to deliver radio frequency energy. The energy burns the tissue in a controlled way, killing cells and causing the tonsils to gradually shrink from within.</p>
        <p>This minimizes pain and bleeding, the company said. The operation, which takes less than an hour, can be done under local anesthesia, whereas tonsillectomies are often performed under general anesthesia.</p>
        <p>''I've done this procedure and people have gone back to work the next morning, which is unheard of for a tonsillectomy,'' said Dr. Lionel M. Nelson, an ear, nose and throat doctor in San Jose, Calif., who is the medical director of Somnus. ''I had one guy eat a sandwich a couple of hours after I did it.''</p>
        <p>The procedure is not totally painless. Susan Holden, an administrative assistant in San Jose who had the procedure performed in late 1998, said it felt afterward as if she had strep throat, with dry mouth and pain in talking or eating certain foods. But she said the swollen tonsils she frequently endured before the operation had not come back.</p>
        <p>Some doctors express caution.</p>
        <p>The procedure has been tested only on adults, not children, who account for about four-fifths of tonsillectomies. The company is planning trials on children, but for them, the procedure would be performed under general anesthesia, eliminating one of the advantages.</p>
        <p>Even for adults, only Dr. Nelson has tried the technique, and he has performed it on 12 people. He has published one paper covering nine patients who were followed after the operation for 12 weeks.</p>
        <p>''You have to follow up patients for several years to see if the tonsils are going to regrow or not,'' said Dr. Nira Goldstein, assistant professor of otolaryngology at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. She is a member of a committee dealing with tonsils for the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.</p>
        <p>Moreover, since Somnoplasty does not completely remove the tonsils, it might not be applicable as a treatment for recurrent tonsil infections. It would be used mainly for people whose breathing is obstructed by enlarged tonsils, Dr. Nelson said.</p>
        <p>Such patients now roughly equal the number of patients who undergo tonsillectomies to treat infections. While antibiotics have reduced the problem of infections, there is growing awareness of sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing is interrupted numerous times at night, putting a strain on the heart and making it difficult to get a restful night's sleep.</p>
        <p>Somnoplasty is already used to treat sleep apnea and snoring by shrinking the tongue, nasal tissue or the soft palate. But Dr. Goldstein and others said since there was an extra risk in using the procedure on tonsils because they are very close to the carotid artery, which carries blood to the brain. Doctors must be certain the vibrations caused by the radio frequencies will not harm that artery.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lawrence W. C. Tom, an otolaryngologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who is also a member of the academy tonsil panel, said Dr. Nelson's scientific study was ''very limited.'' But he added, ''If it works as they say it does, it has a lot of potential.''</p>
