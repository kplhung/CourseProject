        <p>Shimon Peres, three-time prime minister of Israel and one of most enduring standard-bearers for Middle East peace, is defeated by Iranian-born Moshe Katsav, relatively obscure figure, in contest in parliament to become Israel's eighth president; despite distinguished career replete with many honors including Nobel Prize, defeat will almost certainly mark him as one of Israel's great losers; he has lost four of five elections for prime minister, as well as leadership battles within Labor Party that relegated him to runner-up status, first behind late Yitzhak Rabin and current Prime Min Ehud Barak; photo (M)</p>

        <p>At the moment today when the announcement of Parliament's first ballot for Israel's next president made it all but certain that he had lost what was most likely the last big battle of his 60-year political career, Shimon Peres, Nobel Prize laureate, three-time prime minister and one of the most enduring standard-bearers for Middle East peace, remained in character.</p>
        <p>The result, with 60 votes for Moshe Katsav, the Iranian-born immigrant who was the eventual winner, 57 votes for Mr. Peres and 3 blank ballots, brought loud groans, slumped shoulders and moist eyes among members of Parliament backing Mr. Peres to become the country's eighth president.</p>

        <p>At the moment today when the announcement of Parliament's first ballot for Israel's next president made it all but certain that he had lost what was most likely the last big battle of his 60-year political career, Shimon Peres, Nobel Prize laureate, three-time prime minister and one of the most enduring standard-bearers for Middle East peace, remained in character.</p>
        <p>The result, with 60 votes for Moshe Katsav, the Iranian-born immigrant who was the eventual winner, 57 votes for Mr. Peres and 3 blank ballots, brought loud groans, slumped shoulders and moist eyes among members of Parliament backing Mr. Peres to become the country's eighth president.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Peres himself, aware that Mr. Katsav's second-ballot victory was a virtual certainty, merely thrust his hands into the trouser pockets of his dark suit, leaned back against the chamber's rear wall and talked studiedly with friends.</p>
        <p>The vote came as Prime Minister Ehud Barak survived a vote on a no-confidence motion pushed by opponents of his peace effort. [Page A8.]</p>
        <p>To those who know Mr. Peres, the 76-year-old statesman appeared today to be nursing a deep private hurt, but in his manner and words he did nothing overt to belie his reputation for courtliness.</p>
        <p>The outcome cannot have been made easier by the fact that Mr. Katsav, 54, was a relatively obscure figure who had never held an office more weighty than tourism minister and whose name would almost certainly draw blanks in the chancelleries and palaces around the world where Mr. Peres's visits have become a fixture.</p>
        <p>''At this moment, the only thing I have to say is to congratulate Moshe Katsav on his election as president,'' Mr. Peres told reporters after the second ballot confirmed Mr. Katsav as the victor by 63 votes to 57. ''I wish him success and all the best.''</p>
        <p>With no further word for the clamoring throng, Mr. Peres turned and walked away, this time almost certainly into retirement from a political career whose glittering pinnacle was the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the Oslo peace accords. He shared the prize with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister who was assassinated in 1995.</p>
        <p>For all his honors, today's defeat, denying Mr. Peres a five-year term in an office with mainly ceremonial powers, will almost certainly mark him as one of Israel's great losers.</p>
        <p>Even before the vote, the talk in the Parliament hallways was of whether Mr. Peres could shake off the image he has acquired over the last two decades by losing four of five elections for prime minister, as well as leadership battles within the Labor Party that relegated him to runner-up status, first behind Mr. Rabin and then Ehud Barak, the current prime minister.</p>
        <p>While many factors appeared to have combined to secure Mr. Katsav his victory, including the last-minute defection of at least a half-dozen legislators who had assured Mr. Peres of their support, there was no doubt that the perennial loser tag followed him into the vote, and may even have been what sunk him.</p>
        <p>''His reputation as a loser may have been something that influenced some members,'' said a chagrined Yosef Lapid, 68, a veteran lawmaker whose centrist Shinui Party, which has six seats in Parliament, supported Mr. Peres.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Peres, the defeat marked the likely end of a political story that began with his arrival in British-ruled Palestine at age 11, in 1934. As a teenager, he joined Haganah, the  force that protected Jews against Arabs. After 1948, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion assigned him to build up Israel's navy, and he later held more than a dozen top posts.</p>
        <p>Before becoming prime minister for the first time, he had rotated through virtually every important cabinet post, including foreign affairs, finance, defense, transport and information. Israelis count much of the groundwork for the country's nuclear weapons program among his achievements.</p>
        <p>The vacancy in the presidency came with the resignation three weeks ago of Ezer Weizman, 75, a stalwart of the old political elite, who quit midway through his second term after prosecutors issued a report harshly criticizing him for financial improprieties.</p>
        <p>When the day began, accounts in many of Israel's newspapers depicted the presidential vote as a virtual formality. The papers said Mr. Peres's election was more or less assured by his towering reputation as a peacemaker and as a major figure in Israeli governments since the 1960's and by his association, almost from boyhood, with most of the major political icons of Israel's history.</p>
        <p>An eve-of-vote Gallup poll in the newspaper Maariv had Mr. Peres as the popular choice for the post, with 63 percent to 20 percent for Mr. Katsav and 17 percent undecided.</p>
        <p>But political power in Israel has been shifting for years from the old Ashkenazic elite with roots in Eastern Europe that the Polish-born Mr. Peres personifies, and the newspaper forecasts appeared to have underestimated how far the process has gone among the elected members of Parliament.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Katsav, whose first home in Israel was a tent, Parliament chose a man who is not widely known even inside Israel. His home is in Qiryat Malachi, about 30 miles south of Tel Aviv, one of the working-class ''development towns'' that many prosperous Israelis consider deeply unfashionable. But precisely because of this modest background, Mr. Katsav has a strong chance, as president, of turning himself into an icon for many of Israel's six million people.</p>
        <p>When he is sworn in on Tuesday, he will be the first Israeli president from the underclass of Sephardic immigrants who flooded into the country from the Middle East and North Africa in the 1950's. He will also be the first successful presidential nominee from Likud, the rightist party with broad working-class and Sephardic support.</p>
        <p>In the days before the vote, Mr. Katsav campaigned aggressively among the rightist and ultra-Orthodox splinter parties with strong Sephardic support that control crucial blocs of votes in the 120-seat Parliament, tapping the alienation among the have-nots of Israeli society.</p>
        <p>But in victory, he struck a conciliatory note, saying he intended to ''lock up'' his political views during his five-year term and work as ''the loyal representative of all Israeli citizens, of all strata, of all sections, of all classes.''</p>
        <p>The big question facing Israelis after the presidential vote was what impact it would have on peace efforts. After the huge gains made in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations that have been virtually synonymous with Mr. Peres, the march to a final pact faltered last week after 15 days of negotiations at Camp David.</p>
        <p>One theory about Mr. Peres's loss today was that rightist lawmakers could not stomach the prospect of Mr. Peres as president, despite the office's limited powers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Katsav made widely known his opposition to some of the concessions that Mr. Barak offered Mr. Arafat at Camp David.</p>
        <p>In Parliament hallways, some wondered if the erosion of support for Mr. Peres might have been engineered by Mr. Barak, who has had uneasy relationship with his predecessor as Labor Party leader. But Barak aides said Labor had voted solidly for Mr. Peres, and Mr. Barak himself appeared upset.</p>
        <p>But an even stronger factor than calculations about the peace negotiations appeared to have been played by the growing political power of Sephardic parties, and of political groups that draw their support from among the one million Russian immigrants who have arrived in the last two decades.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 4, 2000, Friday  A front-page article on Tuesday about Shimon Peres's defeat in a parliamentary vote for the presidency of Israel misstated the length of the term. Moshe Katsav, the winner, will serve a single term of seven years, not five. The article also overstated the legislative experience of Yosef Lapid, a supporter of Mr. Peres. He is a first-time member of parliament, not a veteran lawmaker.</p>
