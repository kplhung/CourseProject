        <p>Winston &amp; Strawn, the large law firm in Chicago, said yesterday that it would merge with the New York office of Whitman Breed Abbott &amp; Morgan next month as they join the race to become one of the world's 20 largest law firms.</p>
        <p>The new firm, which will use the Winston &amp; Strawn name, will have about 840 lawyers in six offices worldwide and will be run by existing Winston management. The move adds about 80 lawyers in corporate law, capital markets, project finance and venture capital to Winston, bringing its total New York roster to 250 lawyers, Winston officials said.</p>

        <p>Winston &amp; Strawn, the large law firm in Chicago, said yesterday that it would merge with the New York office of Whitman Breed Abbott &amp; Morgan next month as they join the race to become one of the world's 20 largest law firms.</p>
        <p>The new firm, which will use the Winston &amp; Strawn name, will have about 840 lawyers in six offices worldwide and will be run by existing Winston management. The move adds about 80 lawyers in corporate law, capital markets, project finance and venture capital to Winston, bringing its total New York roster to 250 lawyers, Winston officials said.</p>
        <p>Winston ranked 30th in terms of gross revenue in 1999, up from 34th in 1998, according to the latest American Lawyer rankings; Whitman was not in the top 100.</p>
        <p>Winston is expected to have $347 million in revenue for 2000, excluding the $42 million in revenue that it expects to receive because of the merger, officials said.</p>
        <p>''Their practices will integrate quite easily with our practice in New York,'' said James M. Neis, managing partner at Winston, referring to Whitman's lawyers in New York. ''Our client bases are similar.''</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles office of Whitman is expected to announce a separate merger with another firm today. Lawyers from both Winston and Whitman cited conflict-of-interest issues when explaining why the Los Angeles office did not participate in the merger: the office has clients that are involved in litigation with Winston clients, they said.</p>
        <p>In a similar move, Sonnenschein, Nath &amp; Rosenthal of Chicago announced that it was adding the New York office of Cooperman Levitt Winikoff Lester &amp; Newton to its practice, bringing its New York presence up to 52 lawyers.</p>
