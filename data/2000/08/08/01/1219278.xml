        <p>He rarely mentions President Clinton in his stump speeches these days, and his aides are constantly pointing out that the Republican convention will not be devoted to bashing the Democrats. But as Gov. George W. Bush marches toward his coronation in Philadelphia, it is clear that the president is not far from his mind.</p>
        <p>Even as he hits the high notes about family and faith, Mr. Bush's pointed subtext in his five-day, six-state ''Renewing America's Purpose'' tour is President Clinton and Monica S. Lewinsky. Today, as he does at the end of almost every speech, he raised his hand high and made his ritual pledge.</p>
        <p>''I want to conclude by telling you,'' he said, ''that when I put my hand on on the Bible that day in January of 2001, I will swear not only to uphold the laws of the land, I will swear to uphold the honor and integrity of the office to which I have been elected.''</p>
        <p>As usual, the statement proved his biggest applause getter at a rally this morning at the University of Dayton and again at the Statehouse here this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Republicans have been running against Mr. Clinton's character for years often to see their efforts boomerang. But Mr. Bush does it more subtly than some Republicans. And polls show that while Americans are content with the economy, they are concerned about values and the moral state of the nation, and the Bush campaign hopes to capitalize on that discontent.</p>
        <p>''He talks about restoring the honor and integrity to the White House,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's spokeswoman. ''I think that's something that the American people talk with him about at almost every stop and he does talk about the need for that and I think that's something people are looking for in this election.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes took umbrage at the idea that the governor's words amounted to shots at Mr. Clinton. And she disavowed the warmup speakers at Mr. Bush's rally in Cincinnati on Sunday who struck the same anti-Clinton themes less subtly than Mr. Bush. A radio talk show host spoke about the ''filth and degradation of Clinton-Gore'' while the mayor of Blue Ash, Ohio, Jim Sumner, asked, ''Are you ready to have your daughter serve as an intern?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes said, ''Governor Bush hopes that the Republicans across the country will join with him in helping to raise our political discourse to a higher level.''</p>
        <p>In his speech to the convention on Thursday night, she said, Mr. Bush ''will needle his opponents a little but he will treat them with respect. He will not engage in the kind of trash and burn, attack-style politics that we have become so sick of out of Washington.''</p>
        <p>Her words illustrated a basic point and counterpoint of the campaign. While Democrats have gone on the attack against Dick Cheney and his record of votes in Congress, the Bush campaign responds with attacks against attacks, clearly hoping to reinforce the perception of Vice President Al Gore as running a negative campaign.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign says the Republicans are counterattacking because they are ''wrong on the issues.'' Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore said, ''An informed voter is their worst nightmare.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes countered: ''Let's point out a vote where Dick Cheney voted to increase funding for Head Start by 16 percent. Al Gore voted no. Now, should we run an ad claiming Al Gore's against Head Start?''</p>
