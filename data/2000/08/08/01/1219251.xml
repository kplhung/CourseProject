        <p>Expressing a Wish For a Settlement</p>
        <p>It was a 30-minute hearing to set a date for setting a date.</p>
        <p>The justice presiding over the trial of the rap entrepreneur SEAN COMBS on charges of weapons possession and bribery told him to return to court on Sept. 13, and that the trial would start late this year or early in 2001.</p>
        <p>This was after considerable calendar-checking by Mr. Combs, his two co-defendants and their lawyers, who all said they had busy schedules for the next several months. JUSTICE CHARLES SOLOMON of State Supreme Court in Manhattan could set a date for the trial at the Sept. 13 session. But yesterday he sounded as if he would be satisfied if a trial proved to be unnecessary.</p>
        <p>''If there is any way the case can be resolved for any of these defendants without a trial,'' he said, ''don't hesitate. I leave that to the lawyers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Combs, who is known as Puffy, and the other defendants -- Anthony Jones and Jamal Barrow -- were arrested on Dec. 27 after three people were shot and wounded in a nightclub on West 43rd Street. The police say Mr. Barrow was the gunman. Mr. Combs dashed out of the club with his girlfriend, JENNIFER LOPEZ, and fled in a sport utility vehicle, they said. One of the weapons possession charges stems from the discovery of a pistol in the vehicle.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Justice Solomon turned down a motion by Mr. Jones to prevent that gun from being used as evidence at the trial. The judge also rejected a similar motion by Mr. Barrow concerning a gun in his waistband when he was taken into custody.</p>
        <p>Remembering Vets Largely Ignored</p>
        <p>LOIS POPE, whose husband was the owner and publisher of The National Enquirer, zipped into New York the other day, visiting two Police Athletic League camps and talking about the disabled veterans' memorial in Washington that she has been pressing for. She said the idea for the memorial to veterans who were injured in combat came to mind when she visited the Vietnam veterans' memorial several years ago.</p>
        <p>''I asked the park guard at the information booth where the memorial was for disabled American veterans,'' she said. ''He looked at the map and said, 'There isn't one.' I thought: 'Why not? Why shouldn't there be one?' '' The House passed a bill authorizing Mrs. Pope's Disabled Veterans' Life Foundation to establish a memorial in Washington; the Senate did so last month.</p>
        <p>In May, her son PAUL D. POPE announced a $1 million reward for information about the death of his father in 1988 at 61. The cause was said to have been a heart attack, but Mr. Pope has questioned the circumstances.</p>
        <p>''I can't talk about that,'' Mrs. Pope said. ''Maybe some other time. I just want you to know I love all my children.''</p>
        <p>Heston Underwent Alcohol Rehab</p>
        <p>CHARLTON HESTON, who starred in ''Ben-Hur'' and ''Planet of the Apes'' before becoming president of the National Rifle Association, checked himself into an alcohol rehabilitation program in the spring, a spokeswoman said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''He thought he needed to take care of something that could possibly become a huge problem,'' the spokeswoman, LISA DeMATTEO, told The Associated Press. (She did not return a call for comment.) ''He's actually back at work, taking care of himself and feeling great.''</p>
        <p>She told the news service that Mr. Heston checked himself into a rehabilitation center in Utah in late May.</p>
        <p>''I think it was overwork,'' she told the news service. ''He keeps a horrendous travel schedule and he's 76 years old. He's speaking, he's campaigning, he works for the N.R.A., he's been doing all this stuff, and you know how it is, you go to these dinners and they give you a rubber chicken and food that's not really edible and you have a little bit too much wine.''</p>
