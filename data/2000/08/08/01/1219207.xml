        <p>Particle discoveries, like home runs in baseball, get all the attention from casual fans of physics. The arrival of a new particle is exciting, important and easy to understand. But while physicists appreciate the Ruthian impact of discovering a new elementary particle like the top quark or the recent finding of the tau neutrino, they know that there is a less heralded realm of discovery that can do every bit as much to change the course of science. That realm involves laws of symmetry -- how nature obeys them, and especially how it breaks them.</p>
        <p>Physicists' most hallowed theories of the structure of matter are based on the interplay of symmetries as revealed by the ways particles move, interact and decay. For example, the orbits of an electron in a hydrogen atom depend profoundly on the symmetry, or invariance, of the force on the electron no matter how the atomic nucleus is rotated. As in planetary systems, the force depends only on the distance between the electron and the nucleus.</p>
        <p>Measurements of those subtleties can severely test the accuracy of the theories and reveal their shortcomings. In baseball language, symmetries are the pitching and defense of particle physics.</p>
        <p>The mysteries of symmetry and asymmetry extend to the cosmos, too. Scientists have not quite figured out why nearly all the universe they have observed is made of ordinary matter. If the laws of particle physics were exactly the same for every particle and its antimatter partner -- one kind of symmetry -- then the Big Bang explosion in which the universe is believed to have been born would have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter, which would then have annihilated each other, and the universe would be empty.</p>
        <p>Announcements yesterday by two large, multinational experimental teams at the 30th International Conference on High Energy Physics in Osaka, Japan, herald a new round of research to determine the exact degree of nature's lopsidedness, and what consequences it may have for the observable universe -- whether or not other scientists are hitting home runs with new particles.</p>
        <p>''It's not just the discovery of a new particle which is important for particle physics and cosmology,'' said Dr. Hirotaka Sugawara, director general of the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization in Tsukuba, Japan, called the KEK laboratory for its Japanese acronym. One of the teams, both of which presented new, though preliminary results, was based at KEK. ''Symmetry is something we have to understand,'' Dr. Sugawara said.</p>
        <p>At the core of all these concerns are extremely difficult experiments that observe particles and their antimatter counterparts directly, in search of slight differences in things like their decay rates and the particles they decay into.</p>
        <p>Physicists have known since 1964 that small differences exist, but they have not found a way to measure just how large the differences are.</p>
        <p>Without that quantitative knowledge, physicists have been unable to determine whether the asymmetry is correctly predicted by their Standard Model of particle physics, the theory that describes all existing data on the structure and behavior of matter. Any gap between the predictions and observations would mean that the theory is wrong.</p>
        <p>And if the measured asymmetry turns out to be too small, said Dr. Zoltan Ligeti, a physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago, the impact on scientists' understanding of the cosmos could be serious. ''We would be at a complete loss, and we would have to say we don't know a conceivable way to produce more matter than antimatter,'' Dr. Ligeti said.</p>
        <p>But help in answering those questions is on the way, according to the simultaneous announcements yesterday in Osaka.</p>
        <p>The teams, one based at KEK and one at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California, announced that they had each succeeded in producing millions of well-known, if somewhat obscure, particles called B mesons along with their antimatter counterparts. Scientists at these ''B factories'' plan to compare the decay rates of B's and anti-B's with a precision that has never before been possible. The comparison should provide a new measuring stick of one of nature's most basic symmetries -- or asymmetries.</p>
        <p>The results are still so sketchy, and the experiments so demanding, that neither team is ready to claim definitively that it has seen the asymmetry, which goes by the name of charge-parity violation, or CP violation. But as more data streams in, the early results do show hints of the expected signature of CP violation.</p>
        <p>''These results are very preliminary, and they don't turn the world of science on their ear,'' said Dr. David Hitlin, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology and a spokesman for Stanford's BaBar experiment, a play on ''B-bar,'' as anti-B mesons are often called, and the children's book elephant.</p>
        <p>While the results do show hints of CP violation, its observed strength falls slightly below the predictions of the Standard Model. Cosmologists already find it difficult to reconcile the observed asymmetry of matter and antimatter with the amount of CP violation predicted by the Standard Model, so the conflict would throw a big curve at theorists -- just what experimentalists love to do.</p>
        <p>If the finding holds up as more data comes in, Dr. Hitlin said, ''that would be something that would be very exciting.''</p>
        <p>But first, the experimentalists will have to agree with each other. Dr. Sugawara said the KEK experiment, nicknamed Belle, had found a larger value that was in agreement with the Standard Model. With somewhat less data so far than BaBar, Belle's error bars were also large, so that the two results could not be said to be in conflict. An earlier experiment at Fermilab found a still larger value, near the upper end of the predictions, though once again the uncertainties were substantial.</p>
        <p>Dr. Eric Prebys, a physicist at Princeton University who is a collaborator on Belle, said, ''Everything at the moment is consistent with each other.''</p>
        <p>The measurements are demanding enough that physicists are not likely to accept any startling conclusions until the numbers are much more refined and the experiments agree, Dr. Prebys said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the scientific industry of sorts that has grown around CP violation did begin with a completely unexpected discovery in 1964. Before that experiment, which won a Nobel Prize for Dr. James Cronin and Dr. Val Fitch in 1980, scientists were sure that the laws of physics exactly obeyed what is called CP invariance.</p>
        <p>Checking for CP invariance involves the following imaginary process: First, take all particles and reverse their charge (the ''C'' part) from positive to negative or vice versa. Then change particles with lefthanded ''spins'' to being right handed (the ''P'' part) and vice versa. If the particles behave the same in this new world as they did in the old, then the laws of physics are CP invariant.</p>
        <p>Since the CP operation changes any particle into its antiparticle, CP invariance would mean that physical laws are exactly the same for matter and antimatter.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cronin, of the University of Chicago, and Dr. Fitch, of Princeton University, threw a monkey wrench into that symmetric worldview when they found that particles called kaons sometimes decayed in a way that violated this rule. Two Japanese theorists, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa, later showed how the Standard Model could be modified to accommodate this result. But even though the change should cause CP violation in other particles, experimentalists have still not unambiguously detected it in anything but kaons.</p>
        <p>To make things worse, said Dr. Ligeti of Fermilab, theorists find it problematical, for technical reasons, to compare the kaon results in a very precise or direct way to the asymmetry that the theorists put at the heart of the Standard Model. The violation is thought to be related to something called the weak nuclear force, but effects of another interaction called the strong force confuse matters in kaons.</p>
        <p>''What we are after is trying to test whether the Standard Model is right or wrong,'' Dr. Ligeti said. But in order to make a precise test with kaons, he said, ''we have to compute quantities which we don't quite know how to compute.''</p>
        <p>The predicted effect is both simpler to interpret and larger in magnitude in B mesons, said Dr. Fumihiko Takasaki, a KEK physicist who is a spokesman for the Belle collaboration.</p>
        <p>So both collaborations aimed to create pairs of B mesons and anti-B mesons by smashing together electrons and their own antimatter counterparts, positrons, in particle accelerators. The electrons and positrons are accelerated to high energy in a linear accelerator and then injected into a ring, where they circulate in opposite directions and smash together, said Dr. Riccardo Faccini, a BaBar collaborator at the Stanford accelerator center.</p>
        <p>In an experimental twist, the electrons and positrons are injected at slightly different energies so that the B mesons, when they are created, drift steadily in one direction at about half the speed of light rather than remaining stationary. The drift amounts to a clever way to measure time as a meson, and then its antiparticle, decay in a spray of particles. By allowing researchers to trace this spray of particle tracks back to their source, the high-resolution detectors -- called, unsurprisingly, Belle and BaBar -- pinpoint the spot at which the decays take place.</p>
        <p>Since the B mesons are drifting, the distance they have traveled gives a measure of the time at which the decays took place. By comparing the detailed time dependence of B meson decays and anti-B meson decays, physicists can search for evidence of an asymmetry that indicates CP violation has taken place.</p>
        <p>So far, of 10 million B mesons produced in BaBar, 120 have been of the specific type that allows the team to look for CP violation, leading to their preliminary results. Belle still has fewer events, but both teams are collecting large amounts of data in preparation for an all-out assault on the problem.</p>
        <p>''The science of CP violation in the B physics system is born,'' said Dr. Christopher Hill, a physicist at Fermilab.</p>
