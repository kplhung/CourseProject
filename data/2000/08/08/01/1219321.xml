        <p>The Democratic Party released two new 15-second television commercials yesterday timed to the opening of the Republican National Convention that attack the Texas record of Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican's presumed presidential nominee, on health care and the environment.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Democratic Victory 2000.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- In the commercial on health care, a map of Texas with a bandage slung around the Panhandle appears. In the commercial on the environment, the same map is shown, only with fumes billowing from the Panhandle as if from an industrial smokestack. Both close with the words, ''For the facts, visit www.texasunderbush.com.''</p>

        <p>The Democratic Party released two new 15-second television commercials yesterday timed to the opening of the Republican National Convention that attack the Texas record of Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican's presumed presidential nominee, on health care and the environment.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Democratic Victory 2000.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- In the commercial on health care, a map of Texas with a bandage slung around the Panhandle appears. In the commercial on the environment, the same map is shown, only with fumes billowing from the Panhandle as if from an industrial smokestack. Both close with the words, ''For the facts, visit www.texasunderbush.com.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- In one spot, the narrator reads: ''Tonight in Philadelphia, you'll hear a lot about 'leaving no child behind.' Meanwhile, back in Texas, George W. Bush opposed health coverage for 200,000 more children. The state ranked second to last in children with health insurance. Get the facts.''</p>
        <p>In the other spot, the narrator reads: ''Tonight in Philadelphia, you won't hear a lot about 'the environment.' Maybe that's because back in Texas, George W. Bush appointed a chemical company lobbyist to enforce the environmental laws. Houston is now the smog capital of the U.S. Get the facts.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- On health care, it is true that Mr. Bush fought for a plan in 1999 that would have excluded 200,000 of the more than 400,000 children eligible for the federal Children's Health Insurance Program. But the Legislature insisted on the more expansive plan, and Mr. Bush signed the bill. It is also widely accepted that Texas has more uninsured children than any state other than Arizona. The Bush campaign contends that the number of uninsured children is increasing four times faster nationwide than in Texas.</p>
        <p>On the environment, Mr. Bush's first appointee to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission was a former Monsanto executive, Ralph Marquez, who was also vice chairman of a chemical trade group that did lobbying. And according to preliminary statistics from the Environmental Protection Agency, Houston surpassed Los Angeles last year for having the most days that exceeded smog standards. The Bush campaign says it has significantly reduced industrial air pollution since 1995.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Polls suggest Mr. Bush has been adept at reaching out to centrist swing voters on education and health care, traditionally strong issues for the Democrats. The two new advertisements are part of a broader effort to stop Mr. Bush's march toward the center by portraying Texas as suffering an array of social maladies and the governor as beholden to the rich and powerful.</p>
