        <p>''Old-fashioned'' is not an expression anyone in the superchic, see-you-later-Charlie world of fashion magazines would think of applying to Dennis Freedman, the creative director of W, who turned an aging uptown broadsheet into a visually exciting barometer of the here and now.</p>
        <p>But old-fashioned is what Mr. Freedman is, and one need only picture him in his offices, at 7 West 34th Street, to understand what this means. In the first place, he is wearing jeans with a rumpled khaki sport coat and brown side-buckle oxfords, and he has on the sort of patio-style red checkered shirt you'd expect to see on Eddie Haskell as he comes chuckling across the lawn to greet Wally and the Beav.</p>

        <p>''Old-fashioned'' is not an expression anyone in the superchic, see-you-later-Charlie world of fashion magazines would think of applying to Dennis Freedman, the creative director of W, who turned an aging uptown broadsheet into a visually exciting barometer of the here and now.</p>
        <p>But old-fashioned is what Mr. Freedman is, and one need only picture him in his offices, at 7 West 34th Street, to understand what this means. In the first place, he is wearing jeans with a rumpled khaki sport coat and brown side-buckle oxfords, and he has on the sort of patio-style red checkered shirt you'd expect to see on Eddie Haskell as he comes chuckling across the lawn to greet Wally and the Beav.</p>
        <p>Second, he is at his desk in the vast third-floor newsroom that W shares with its sister publication, Women's Wear Daily. There is a private office behind him that he can duck into for meetings or just to eat a sandwich, but generally, in the longstanding tradition of his boss, Patrick McCarthy, and their mentor, John Fairchild, the retired chairman of Fairchild Publications, Mr. Freedman likes to sit out among the reporters.</p>
        <p>''He isn't an isolated person,'' Joe McKenna, a freelance stylist who works for W and is involved in next month's reintroduction of the men's magazine Details, where Mr. Freedman is also creative director. ''He's sitting there in front of all those people, and he's up and walking around and talking to everyone. I think that environment very much reflects Dennis's character.''</p>
        <p>It's also telling that both the photographer Bruce Weber and the editor Polly Mellen, who are themselves old school, say that Mr. Freedman's open approach -- in particular his ability to recognize the brilliance of an idea even when it's offered in the flakiest terms -- reminds them of the collaborative atmosphere created by Alexey Brodovitch at Harper's Bazaar in the 1940's, and by his successors in the magazine's art department, Marvin Israel, Bea Feitler and Ruth Ansel.</p>
        <p>''You've got to understand,'' Mr. Weber said last week, ''in this business, most editors and creative directors say no to everybody. Dennis doesn't.'' As a result, the editorial well of W has emerged as an important -- maybe the most important -- creative showcase for photography among American fashion magazines. Fabien Baron, a former creative director of Harper's Bazaar whose cinematic portraits of writhing models appear in the current issue of W, said: ''In Europe it's Italian Vogue and in America it's W -- and I would add Vogue, because it's still the pinnacle of American fashion. But that's it.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. McCarthy's view, a turning point came three years ago when W ran a series of pictures Mr. Weber took of Kate Moss, Marianne Faithfull and Stella McCartney. Of course, agreeing to publish Bruce Weber's photographs hardly involves mental lifting. What's interesting -- and this says a lot about why many fashion magazines don't work today -- is that Mr. Freedman didn't hesitate when Mr. Weber presented him with the idea, which was along the lines of ''Let's bring a bunch of English girls together and shoot them.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Weber said of this spontaneous, seemingly chaotic approach: ''Dennis doesn't call you up and say he has a job for you. He calls you up and says, 'Have you ever thought about going to Philadelphia?' ''</p>
        <p>So here is Mr. Freedman, who is 48, with his patio-red checks and easygoing way, and the question that keeps popping up is how: how did this successful commercial magazine (fifth in ad pages behind In Style, Vogue, Cosmopolitan and Elle, with a circulation of 475,000) manage to become a hotbed of great photography while remaining, in its editorial formula of Hollywood and jet-set trivia, fundamentally the squarest of publications? (''Oh, completely,'' agreed the London-based photographer Juergen Teller, who regards W as his primary American outlet. ''It's like, Hello.'')</p>
        <p>The answer, of course, is somehow wrapped up in Mr. Freedman's personality -- and the journalistic ethos of Fairchild. ''Patrick is very decisive,'' Mr. Freedman said, referring to Mr. McCarthy, W's editorial director. ''He doesn't have a long attention span. It's just, 'Let's do it.' And there's trust, an amazing amount of trust.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Freedman, who grew up in Harrisburg, Pa., and did a little of this and that before going to Fairchild in the 1980's as a graphic designer, is one of those busy people who like to give the impression, to borrow a phrase from J. D. Salinger, of never dropping anything for a ringing phone. He seems to have all the time in the world. Last Tuesday, for instance, he was up at the Details office, on Madison Avenue, going over some ideas with an assistant for a design column. Mr. Freedman wants design and architecture to be strong elements in Details.</p>
        <p>He liked some photos of a couple of prototypes -- a condom dispenser, an electric guitar -- but passed on BMW's new motorcycle. ''GQ is going to run that motorcycle, believe me,'' he said. ''As great as it is, it's kind of lazy and boring.'' In between, he took a call from the photographer Philip-Lorca di Corcia. ''I just saw the pictures,'' Mr. Freedman told him. ''Wow!''</p>
        <p>The next day, when the photographer Paul Jasmin dropped by with galleys of his new book, Mr. Freedman spent more than an hour chatting with him. That evening, Mr. Freedman met with the photographer Steven Klein, and on Thursday morning stopped by Michael Thompson's studio, where Stephanie Seymour was posing for the September cover of W. The previous week, he had been in Seattle on a photo shoot. From there he flew to Paris to oversee photography of the haute couture, then to Philadelphia to see Mr. Weber. That evening, he flew to Sicily, where Mr. Thompson was photographing the actor Joseph Fiennes.</p>
        <p>No other creative director spends this kind of time with photographers, and it's why Mr. Freedman has been successful getting some of the best talent, including Craig McDean and Martin Parr (who is going around the world for Details doing self-portraits in eight shirts Mr. Freedman gave him). ''There are so many talented people out there, but they can't do anything if someone puts the lid on,'' said Ms. Mellen, who went to El Salvador on a shoot with Mr. Freedman. ''He pulled out of me moments when I said: 'No kidding, Dennis? You can really publish this?' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Freedman seems to sense that the freedom he has is rare in the magazine world, but the troubles that photographers often speak about -- the fear and second-guessing by editors that so often seem to choke the creative process and produce few shining moments -- don't greatly interest him. He can't imagine, he said, telling a photographer like Mr. Weber or Mr. McDean how to shoot something. ''It would be like telling John Updike to write long, winding sentences but make sure they're happy ones,'' he said. When Mr. di Corcia expressed a vague idea about going to Havana, Mr. Freedman said his response was, ''Great -- let's go.''</p>
        <p>At one point last week he happened to remark that his least favorite words are ''modern'' and ''edgy.'' Which is somewhat funny coming from someone who has pushed the boundaries of not only what is interesting in fashion photography but also what is important to say about today's culture. The fact that W freely publishes images that don't emphasize or even show clothes is partly what sets the magazine apart. As he spoke, Mr. Freedman brought out some images taken by Mr. di Corcia for the September issue that explored voyeurism in a distinctly Park Avenue setting.</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Freedman knows, his approach is not novel. It is, indeed, an  old-fashioned one, going back to the early days of Vogue and Bazaar. It's just that he now makes the pursuit of good work seem so uncomplicated.</p>
