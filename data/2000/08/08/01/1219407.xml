        <p>Michael Clark became the sixth first-time winner on the PGA Tour this season when he rolled in a 12-foot birdie putt on the fourth playoff hole yesterday to defeat the veteran Kirk Triplett in the rain-delayed completion of the John Deere Classic in Silvis, Ill.</p>
        <p>The victory meant a $468,000 paycheck and a two-year exemption for clark, a tour rookie who finished 11th in qualifying school last November to get his tour card.</p>
        <p>The best previous finish this season for Clark, who is from Dalton, Fa., was a tie for 13th at the Compaq Classic in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>In a final round suspected Sunday because of heavy rain, Clark shot a four-under 67, but Triplett birdied the final hole of regulation to tie in a tournament-record 19-under-par 265. Triplett, whose victory in the Nissan Open this year was his career first, had a final-round 70. Triplett twice made birdies to keep the playoff going.</p>
        <p>(AP)  WOODS TO PLAY DUBAI: Tiger Woods said yesterday he would play in the Dubai Desert Classic next March. Woods has played at least one internatinoal event each year since turning pro in 1996. He has played the Deutsche Bank-SAP Open in Germany the past two years. The Dubai tournament, at Emirates Golf Club on March 1-4, will be played at the same time as the Doral Open, an event Woods has not played since 1997.</p>
