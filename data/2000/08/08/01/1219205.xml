        <p>Two gifts totaling $12.5 million have cleared the way for the development of what is being described as the world's most powerful radio telescope designed specifically to listen for signals that may be coming from civilizations elsewhere in the galaxy.</p>
        <p>The SETI Institute of Mountain View, Calif., a private organization conducting research to determine whether intelligent life exists beyond Earth, announced yesterday that the money would be used to begin work on a proof-of-concept version of the telescope. Under current plans, the telescope, a cluster of many 12-foot dish receivers, would be ready for full operation in 2005.</p>
        <p>The principal gift, of $11.5 million, came from Paul G. Allen, a Seattle investor, one of the founders of Microsoft and a philanthropist of scientific research. The project is being renamed the Allen Telescope Array. A $1 million donation by Dr. Nathan P. Myhrvold, former chief technology officer of Microsoft, is to be used to build an electronics laboratory for analyzing data gathered by the telescope.</p>
        <p>The telescope is to be built at the Hat Creek Observatory, 290 miles northeast of San Francisco on a site operated by the University of California at Berkeley. The total cost of the immediate project is estimated at $26 million, but in concept, the telescope array can be regularly modified with improved technology and expanded by adding hundreds of mass-produced dish antennas over a 2.5-acre area.</p>
        <p>Astronomers said the Allen Telescope should enable them to examine up to a dozen target stars simultaneously in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence and to detect signals over an extremely wide range of frequencies. At the same time, other astronomers could be using the telescope for non-SETI observations. And a recent study on astronomy by the National Academy of Sciences praised the concept as innovative.</p>
        <p>''It's a really beautiful win-win situation,'' said Dr. Jill Tarter, research director at the SETI Institute.</p>
