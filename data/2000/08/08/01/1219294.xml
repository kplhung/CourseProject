        <p>More than 1,500 firefighters and a fleet of helicopters and tankers continued to battle a 63,270-acre wildfire in the Sierra Nevada today, with the blaze still only about 15 percent contained  and dangerous dry lightning forecast.</p>
        <p>The fire, which destroyed eight homes in a tiny mountain town over the weekend, started on July 22, of a cause that is unknown, and has burned through the Sequoia National Forest about 120 miles north of here.  It has cost about $4.3 million so far and is just one of about 45 fires burning over nearly 500,000 acres in California, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho and Montana.</p>
        <p>Officials at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, said hot, dry weather, lightning without rain and a spate of new fires were taxing firefighting capacity throughout the region. Training began today for the Army's Third Battalion, 16th Field Artillery, which is being called in from Fort Hood, Tex., to help firefighters in Idaho.</p>
        <p>''This is the worst fire season we've had since 1988,'' said Michelle Barrett, a spokeswoman at the center, noting the atypically hot, dry conditions throughout the region. ''If we had to write a formula for disaster, this is it. You could not write a better formula for having dangerous fires.''</p>
        <p>Today alone, eight new fires were reported scattered throughout the region, and Ms. Barrett said overworked and exhausted firefighters would soon have to be rotated off duty for rest. She said officials would also have to be selective about where they put their stretched resources, trying to control fires of less than 10 acres as quickly as possible in what is known as ''initial attack'' to keep them from spreading, and, eventually, letting some isolated areas burn.</p>
        <p>''As much as we worry about the fires, there's not a blade of grass or a tree out there that's important as the lives of our firefighters,'' Ms. Barrett  said.</p>
        <p>Except for a training accident in Alaska, there have been no firefighter fatalities in forest fires this year.</p>
        <p>The fire in the Sequoia forest, a habitat for California spotted owls, is in an isolated area west of California Route 395. Eleven firefighters there have suffered injuries, all minor.  Nine water-spraying helicopters and eight fixed-wing aircraft dumping flame-retardant chemicals are being used to supplement the efforts of firefighters on the ground, said Doug Johnston, an engineer with the Fire Department of neighboring Kern County, who was one of those called to the scene to help attack the blaze.</p>
        <p>''The estimate now is that it won't be fully controlled for about two weeks,'' Mr. Johnston said, speaking by telephone from a regional command center in the town of Kernville.  ''Our weather is going to change on us, with thunderstorms forecast. If we could get some precipitation, that would be good. But the history of this area is you just get lightning, with no rain.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday, the fire destroyed houses and trailers in the isolated hamlet of Pine Creek, part of an area known as Kennedy Meadows. It had earlier burned eight outbuildings and lodges, including five in an abandoned Boy Scout camp.</p>
        <p>A few structures in the area remain at risk. But Mr. Johnston said that the entire population at the peak of summer was about 100 and that most residents, perhaps all, had already been evacuated.</p>
        <p>Two smaller fires were also still burning in Southern and Central California today, one on the Pechanga Indian Reservation in the Cleveland National Forest, just east of Temecula, and the other in the Los Padres National Forest, 25 miles north of Cambria on the Central Coast, which was expected to be contained by Tuesday.</p>
