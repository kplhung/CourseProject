      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Indo-Caribbeans of Trinidad, descendants of indentured workers brought from India from 1838 to 1917, have had a fairly occluded history; even those who don't speak Hindi have to a great degree maintained and protected their own Indian culture within the island. Fusions between the two cultures have been slow and subtle. So Mungal Patasar's band Pantar, which played at the New York Society for Ethical Culture on Friday night, was an example of rather proactive world-musicking -- a will imposed on two cultures to grow closer.</p>
        <p>Starting in the late 70's, Mr. Patasar, an Indian from Trinidad, got involved in creating a style called Indo-Calypso-Jazz. It's a slight misnomer, for the greatest fusion going on here is between sitar and steel-pan drums; the jazzlike chords of an electronic keyboard are more the property of pop music. On Friday he brought this music to New York for the first time. The sitar and the steel pan sounded amazingly comfortable together; they both make thin, trebly music. They seemed to create a natural seedbed for a meaningful fusion.</p>

        <p>The Indo-Caribbeans of Trinidad, descendants of indentured workers brought from India from 1838 to 1917, have had a fairly occluded history; even those who don't speak Hindi have to a great degree maintained and protected their own Indian culture within the island. Fusions between the two cultures have been slow and subtle. So Mungal Patasar's band Pantar, which played at the New York Society for Ethical Culture on Friday night, was an example of rather proactive world-musicking -- a will imposed on two cultures to grow closer.</p>
        <p>Starting in the late 70's, Mr. Patasar, an Indian from Trinidad, got involved in creating a style called Indo-Calypso-Jazz. It's a slight misnomer, for the greatest fusion going on here is between sitar and steel-pan drums; the jazzlike chords of an electronic keyboard are more the property of pop music. On Friday he brought this music to New York for the first time. The sitar and the steel pan sounded amazingly comfortable together; they both make thin, trebly music. They seemed to create a natural seedbed for a meaningful fusion.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the rest of the music didn't come off that well. In a program that mixed raga (performed by Mr. Patasar and the tablaist Prashant Patasar alone), favorite old calypsos of Lord Kitchener, the old Cuban favorite ''El Cumbanchero'' and touches of reggae, the problem was a clunky group sound; ''jazz'' as sophistication can be a red herring if it ends up meaning the gooey sounds of synthesized keyboards and saxophones. They played music from an album planned by the French division of Virgin records; perhaps the band, which has been together for six years, has suffered from Parisian production values, which can make a lot of music from around the world sound similarly middle-of-the-road. The communication between Mr. Patasar and the steel-pan player, Harold Headley, was decent, but at low points the music moved into torpid background-entertainment territory.</p>
        <p>Opening the concert were the San Jose Serenaders, who represent a strain of Spanish music in Trinidad: the tradition of parang, which began with Venezuelan laborers who moved to the island in the late 1600's. The music's basic use is as Christmas carols; though Spanish is hardly spoken in Trinidad anymore, parang singers move from house to house, alternating religious and secular songs, explaining their lyrics. The music used the stamping triplets of Spanish folk song, with no discernible African elements in it; the songs were tight, infectious and loaded with strummed string instruments.</p>
        <p>Two cuatro (small four-string guitar) players and a mandolin player led the band, with an acoustic guitar and a bass besides. The singer Deborah Joseph delivered songs in phonetic Spanish, and good dancing took care of the rest; Anthony Phillip came out from behind his percussion instruments to execute graceful, waist-winding salsa moves, one hand over his stomach and the other in the air.</p>
