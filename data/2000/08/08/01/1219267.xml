        <p>The assignment for Erikka Richardson's third-grade class was to write an essay on what the pupils did during their summer vacation. And the one thing that  Ms. Richardson could be sure of was that the essays would be short.</p>
        <p>Classes began today at Robert Treat Academy, just a month after the last school year ended, and the students at this charter school in Newark's northern reaches were back at it for another year in what state education officials said was the earliest school opening they could remember. The academy also has the longest school year of any public school in New Jersey -- 210 days, compared with the 180 days in a normal school year and the average 188 in charter schools.</p>
        <p>With bright new backpacks already bulging with new notebooks, pencil cases and erasers, the academy's 250 students -- in first through fourth grades -- seemed enthusiastic about returning to school while their friends in regular public and parochial schools were still deep in summer vacation.</p>
        <p>Kimberly Rodriguez, 6, a newly minted first grader, was simply glad to be in the first grade. Elizabeth Sanchez, 5, a kindergartner, was there shyly on the assurances of her brother Luis, a fourth grader, that ''school was fun.''</p>
        <p>And in Ms. Richardson's third-grade class, Jelahn Wilson, 8, said the summer was ''not very long but it seemed fun.''</p>
        <p>''I went on a trip to the Big Apple to see 'Beauty and the Beast,' and a trip to Funtime America,'' his essay began, then veered suddenly into the future tense to make up for the paucity of material. ''But next summer I think I am going to go to Jamaica with my grandmother because she needs help and. . . . ''</p>
        <p>Under provisions of the state law that authorized New Jersey's publicly financed charter schools, the 46 such schools now in operation have more flexibility in programming, structure, setting and curriculum than other public schools. And three years ago, when the founders of Robert Treat Academy looked at the traditional school calendar, they saw a holdover from an agrarian time that had little to do with urban America and even less to do with the needs of Newark's children.</p>
        <p>''We found out that we needed 25 percent more time in the day, and so we run from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.,'' said Stephen N. Adubato, one of the guiding forces behind the academy's creation and the executive director of the North Ward Center, a publicly financed social services agency in this mostly Italian and Hispanic neighborhood. ''And we found that we didn't need to have the kids out there hanging out in these dirty streets. They need structure, and this charter school is a lab with a license to innovate and test those things.''</p>
        <p>Experts on the charter school movement, as well as those involved in the public debates over the extended school year, suggest that longer school days and years are unlikely to catch on at other public schools. For one thing, many charter schools are viewed as elitist, and as hostile competitors with other public schools for the best students. And the scheduling flexibility the charter schools enjoy reflects their freedom from the contract requirements and benefits that teachers' unions have worked hard to achieve and protect. (The unions and the New Jersey Department of Education have agreed to let the Legislature approve such flexibility, as long as the number of charter schools is limited.)</p>
        <p>Still, the extended school year is steadily gaining popularity, said Marilyn Stenvall, executive director of the National Association for Year-Round Education, which counts any school with fewer than eight weeks off during the summer as a year-round school. About 3,000 public schools in 43 states and the District of Columbia now qualify as year-round schools.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, at a time in our educational life when we are looking to standards in education, more quality time leads to more quality learning,'' said Ms. Stenvall, adding that tradition has been the biggest barrier to changing school calendars and hours. ''And the charter school movement is fertile ground for year-round schools because they are groups looking for change from the outset.''</p>
        <p>Research by the Center for the Social Organization of Schools at Johns Hopkins University adds some scientific weight to Mr. Adubato's view that time spent on city streets in the summer is wasted or even harmful for many students from poor families. The research found what it termed a ''summer slide'' in which poor students who were learning at the same pace as their more affluent counterparts during the regular school year fell much further behind over the summer, and tended to forget more of what they had learned.</p>
        <p>Rosa Chilquillo, the mother of a fourth grader at Robert Treat Academy, said she felt that children lost out with the shorter school year and benefited from the ''good structure'' and immaculate surroundings of the academy.</p>
        <p>Carmen Sanchez, a public school teacher in West Orange who has two children at the academy, said she spent much of the start of each school year reviewing old lessons with her students just to catch up.</p>
        <p>Ms. Richardson, the third-grade teacher, echoed the view of most of the academy's teachers when asked why she was willing to work nearly 11 months a year for the same pay that teachers in public schools get for about working about 10 months.  At first, she said, she thought it would be a ''terrible personal adjustment,'' but it turned out not to be.  She found that her students arrived ready, needing no extensive review.</p>
        <p>The academy's principal, Michael A. Pallante, said the school got about $7,500 per student a year from the Newark school system -- about 90 percent of what other public schools get per student. That money is supplemented with donations from foundations, corporations and the North Ward Center, he said.</p>
        <p>The school, in a spacious former Christian Science church, opened in 1997 with only a first grade, and has added a new grade each year. This year the school, with its first fourth-grade class, will administer the statewide assessment test for all fourth graders.</p>
        <p>As for the short summer, one parent, Carol Thompson, allowed that she had ''some reservations about my child missing the time off and time to just be a kid.''</p>
        <p>But she added, ''With every benefit you get, I guess you have to give up something.''</p>
