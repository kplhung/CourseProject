        <p>In the largest media deal in Canadian history, CanWest Global Communications, a company that started 20 years ago with a North Dakota television station, is to pay $2.36 billion for dominant dailies in 8 of Canada's 10 provinces.

        <p>Making a bold bet on the future braiding of television, newspapers and the Internet, Canada's second-largest private television network said today that it would buy about half of the country's larger daily newspapers from Conrad Black, the international press magnate.</p>
        <p>In the largest media deal in Canadian history, CanWest Global Communications, a company that started 20 years ago with a North Dakota television station, is to pay $2.36 billion for dominant dailies in 8 of Canada's 10 provinces. Mr. Black is to gain a seat on the CanWest board and is to become the second-largest shareholder, after the family of the company founder, Israel H. Asper.</p>
        <p>''The borders are gone, we have to grow,'' Mr. Asper, Global's chairman, told a news conference in Toronto today, comparing his acquisition to Tribune Media's recent purchase of The Los Angeles Times. ''We don't intend to be one of the corpses lying beside the information highway.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Black said in a statement that his company, Hollinger International, ''believes this intimate association with a highly successful telecaster built by an entrepreneurial spirit compatible with Hollinger is the best possible assurance of the strength of the newspaper franchises.''</p>
        <p>In the political realm, the newspaper ownership change could affect Canada's growing conservative movement. Mr. Black has placed his free-market stamp on some of the nation's most influential editorial pages. During the recent leadership race of the new conservative party, the Canadian Alliance, his National Post newspaper seemed, to some readers, to be the movement's official newspaper.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Asper, who runs his national television network from his hometown of Winnipeg, Manitoba, has long been seen as a low-profile social democrat, running the provincial branch of the Liberal Party for five years in the 1970's. Canada does not have laws barring the ownership of newspapers and television stations in the same media market, and the Liberal government of Jean Chretien is not expected to place regulatory barriers in the way of this merger.</p>
        <p>''It looks as if the unapologetic conservative, Conrad Black, has surrendered the reins,'' Chris Dornan, director of Carleton University's journalism school, said today from Ottawa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Black's sale seemed to be motivated at least in part by his large debt load, $1.6 billion. Under the deal, CanWest will assume responsibility for about $460 million in Hollinger debt.</p>
        <p>In the first half of this year, Canada's print media suffered a psychological body blow as most of the nation's newspapers were put up for sale, either by Mr. Black or by Kenneth R. Thomson. Mr. Thomson, chairman of the Thomson Corporation, clearly said that he wanted to invest deeper in electronic information services. Two weeks ago, Mr. Thomson completed the sale of his 49 American newspapers, for $2.44 billion. Mr. Thomson is trying to sell five of his Canadian newspapers and has said he will retain ownership of The Globe and Mail of Toronto.</p>
        <p>Mr. Black has sent mixed signals about newspapers. In April, he said he wanted to sell his Canadian weeklies and smaller dailies. But with today's announcement, he is selling newspapers that dominate some of Canada's most important markets, including The Ottawa Citizen, The  Gazette of Montreal, The Calgary Herald, The Edmonton Sun and The Vancouver Province.</p>
        <p>If the sale goes through as expected in late September, Mr. Black, 55, will have tailored his press fief to ownership of newspapers in prestige cities that he cares about: The Daily Telegraph in London, The Jerusalem Post and The Chicago Sun-Times. As for his pet Canadian project, The National Post, a Toronto-based newspaper that in less than two years of existence has added a muscular conservative voice to Canada's intellectual debate, Mr. Black is to become the newspaper's chairman for five years and Hollinger is to retain management control. CanWest will own 50 percent of this newspaper.</p>
        <p>Mr. Black was on vacation in Europe and did not return telephone calls left at his Toronto and New York offices. But in his press statement, he seemed to expect criticism.</p>
        <p>''There continues to be an audible body of opinion that holds that the newspaper industry has entered a period of stagnation or even decline,'' said Mr. Black, who is Hollinger's chairman. ''We strenuously disagree with this and look forward to demonstrating both the fallacy of this view and the enduring vitality of quality newspaper assets intelligently managed and imaginatively linked with other media.''</p>
        <p>Don Babick, The Post publisher, declined in an interview to predict how the marriage of electronic and print media would happen, saying only, ''We are blending ourselves with a first-class national telecaster.''</p>
        <p>The deal would strengthen the news-gathering capacity of CanWest, making it ''far and away the leading Canadian media operation,'' said Mr. Dornan, a former television journalist. ''These guys are going to have the most robust news rooms in every single market in the country.''</p>
        <p>CanWest estimated that the combined strengths of the merged operations could save the company up to $100 million a year.</p>
        <p>Little known in the United States, CanWest Global emerged in recent years as Canada's third-largest television network, after CBC, the government-owned network, and CTV, a privately owned network. BCE, a major telecommications holding company, wants to buy CTV, largely with the idea of piping TV and Internet programs over Bell lines.</p>
        <p>From the small station imported 20 years ago from North Dakota, CanWest grew by calling its collection of separately licensed stations a ''system'' rather than a ''network.'' Under Canadian laws at the time, networks had to show a higher percentage of Canadian-made programs than systems. American programs can be bought for one-tenth the cost of producing Canadian programs.</p>
        <p>''Global has been as studiously nonpolitical as possible, producing as little Canadian content as possible and making as much money as possible,'' said Vincent A. Carlin, chairman of the journalism school of Ryerson Polytechnic University, in Toronto. ''They were always failing the government guidelines, and always getting a break.''</p>
        <p>After succeeding in Canada, Mr. Asper methodically expanded in the industrialized English-speaking world, buying television stations in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.</p>
        <p>''He has taken some of the economics of a big-box retailer and applied them to small-market media, where you buy American programming in bulk and pass the savings along,'' said Paul W. Taylor, who worked for Mr. Asper's first television station before studying the company for a doctorate in communications. He said CanWest Global was one of the largest buyers of American television programming.</p>
        <p>Dr. Taylor predicted that with the merger, the newspapers would strengthen TV news programs, the newspapers would promote the TV entertainment shows and advertisers would get larger audiences. ''If you are a national advertiser, with a single buy,'' he said, ''you will be able to reach the eyeballs you want to move your goods.''</p>
        <p>A few years ago, CanWest Global became a full network. Now, Mr. Asper and his son, Leonard, the president of CanWest, may have decided that Canadian news is the Canadian content that Canadians most want to see. By this reasoning, Californians want to see California news, but not necessarily California movies. Mr. Dornan said, ''News about ourselves, journalism, current affairs programming, documentaries -- that's what Canadians want to see.''</p>
        <p>At first glance, the deal today suggested that Mr. Black might eventually play a bigger role in Global. He has repeatedly entered companies by holding a minority position, then ended up wresting control. He is to get 15 percent of the equity of CanWest, making him the largest shareholder after the Asper family.</p>
        <p>But this time, Mr. Black may have to settle for what the deal offers: a seat on the CanWest board for himself and for another Hollinger representative.</p>
        <p>''The Asper family's control of the corporation is beyond his reach,'' Richard Siklos, author of ''Shades of Black: Conrad Black and the World's Fastest Growing Press Empire'' (McClelland &amp; Stewart, 1995 ), said today. ''It's an exit strategy for Black and these newspapers. I wouldn't expect it to be a lasting partnership.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 2, 2000, Wednesday  An article in Business Day yesterday about the sale of several large daily newspapers in Canada by the press baron Conrad Black to CanWest Global Communications misidentified one paper in the deal. It is The Edmonton Journal, not The Edmonton Sun.</p>
