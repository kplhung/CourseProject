        <p>CONGRESSIONAL RACES GET SHORT SHRIFT</p>
        <p>Though Republicans have made retaining control of the House of Representatives a priority this election year, the House campaign effort was not given any prime time for the week at the convention, and just 30 minutes at the podium midday yesterday. The Senate, where Republican control seems more likely but the margin of majority is only eight, also got just a half-hour.</p>

        <p>CONGRESSIONAL RACES GET SHORT SHRIFT</p>
        <p>Though Republicans have made retaining control of the House of Representatives a priority this election year, the House campaign effort was not given any prime time for the week at the convention, and just 30 minutes at the podium midday yesterday. The Senate, where Republican control seems more likely but the margin of majority is only eight, also got just a half-hour.</p>
        <p>'INTEGRITY' IS USED AS CORE CAMPAIGN THEME</p>
        <p>As he makes his way to Philadelphia, Gov. George W. Bush has pointedly invoked President Clinton and the Monica Lewinsky scandal. In speech after speech on his ''Renewing America's Purpose'' tour, he has ended with a reference to upholding ''the honor and integrity of the office'' of the presidency -- and has gotten his biggest applause. Polls show that while Americans are content with the economy, they are concerned about values; the Bush campaign hopes to capitalize on that discontent.</p>
        <p>RACE FOR TOP SPOT ON COMMERCE COMMITTEE</p>
        <p>Representatives Michael G. Oxley of Ohio and Billy Tauzin of Louisiana have brought their cash-fueled competition for the chairmanship of the House Commerce Committee to the convention. Each has scheduled parties for last night or tonight financed by the companies the committee regulates. The committee affects much of American industry and its chairman is one of the most powerful figures on Capitol Hill.</p>
