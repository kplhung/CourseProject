        <p>Ending a conflict over the fate of a forest rich in both wood and wildlife, loggers, biologists and the government of Gabon have agreed to keep bulldozers and chain saws out of a 1,900-square-mile reserve with the highest density of large mammals ever recorded in a tropical rain forest.</p>
        <p>The deal includes a slight redrawing of the boundaries of Gabon's Lope Reserve, subtracting 400 square miles of land on the southeastern flank that holds the richest stands of valuable okoume trees, and adding about 200 square miles of previously unprotected terrain that includes remote upland forests that have only rarely, if ever, felt the footfall of a human.</p>
        <p>Several biologists working in the region say the net loss of land is worth it. The area opened to logging had been farmed less than 200 years ago and so is relatively recent growth. In contrast, they say, the newly protected area, which was to have been cut by Malaysian and French companies, is a priceless reservoir of biological riches that is thought to have been essentially undisturbed for the last 10,000 years.</p>
        <p>More important, they say, the agreement -- signed last month by the country's major logging companies, the government, and a variety of private environmental groups -- finally brings meaning to the word reserve, with the government and loggers committing for the first time never to violate the new boundaries.</p>
        <p>The Lope Reserve has also been designated as the first candidate for national park status in Gabon, a country that prospered through oil in the past, but has been in economic decline recently and has seen timber as the source of future wealth. Gabon straddles the Equator and rises from Africa's west coast in a river-laced patchwork of savannah, deep forest and mountains.</p>
        <p>Lee J. T. White, a zoologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society in the Bronx, who has studied Gabonese chimpanzees and rainbow-faced mandrills, said the deal was a major victory for African wildlife.</p>
        <p>For years, he documented how logging was driving adjacent chimpanzee groups into warfare. All around Central Africa, he said, logging roads have provided quick access for hunters supplying the exploding urban market for bush meat, killing everything from snakes to gorillas.</p>
        <p>This practice results in what biologists are calling ''empty forest syndrome,'' Dr. White said, in which snares and guns remove almost every living thing, leaving a green but silent landscape that appears intact but is in fact a zoological desert.</p>
        <p>Now, at least for the forests of Lope, he said, that threat is ended.</p>
        <p>''We don't really want to set the precedent that every time a logger says he wants to log in a reserve you're going to redesign it willy-nilly,'' Dr. White said. ''But we've gone from a situation where about two-thirds of the reserve was actually in logging concessions to the point where we've lost some land but the whole reserve is protected from logging forever.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone is thrilled with the deal. Several private environmental groups in Europe have taken a hard line against logging in the region, saying the companies, all based in Europe or Asia, have too much economic power and the governments are too quick to cave in.</p>
        <p>They say the larger international environmental groups that negotiated the agreement, including the World Wildlife Fund, are far too trusting.</p>
        <p>Simon Counsell, director of the British arm of the Rainforest Foundation, said the net loss of preserve land still had the feel of a giveaway, when the right thing to do would have been for the government simply to enforce its laws.</p>
        <p>''It may be that the new area is better,'' Mr. Counsell said. ''But one can't help but suspect that it's more an indication of the influence and power of some of the large logging companies in Gabon. In some stage further down the line, who's to say that they couldn't redraw the boundaries again?''</p>
        <p>But Gabonese officials say the commitment is real.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Richard Onouviet, the minister of land and water, described how representatives from differing camps, including the World Wildlife Fund and Leroy Gabon, a French-owned logging company, remained cloistered in negotiations for two long meetings to find a suitable compromise.</p>
        <p>''We're preserving the ecological interests but permitting the rational development of the country's forests,'' Mr. Onouviet said. ''The companies working here understand this is the policy of the government.''</p>
        <p>Biologists said the Gabonese shift to considering the ecological consequences of forestry had come just in time to save the most important parts of Lope, which were scheduled for clearing.</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's, logging companies, including Leroy Gabon, a subsidiary of Isoroy, a large French forestry company, had invested heavily in mills in Gabon needed to keep a supply of logs flowing. They had logging rights to okoume stands near the reserve, and after cutting those, were pressing the government for the right to log within the reserve. Okoume is prized in Europe and Asia because it has a red grain and water resistance similar to redwood.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists had long criticized the government for granting logging rights within the reserve. Starting around 1997, some of the more radical European groups began an intensive public relations campaign attacking the big forestry companies for imperiling a supposedly protected forest.</p>
        <p>In addition, the World Bank and other international lending organizations were putting pressure on Gabon to improve its environmental record.</p>
        <p>All this culminated in meetings in Gabon over the last few months in which representatives of Isoroy and other companies said they would agree to give up the rights within the reserve if they received other logging rights in return -- and also if they were at least allowed to cut the rich okoume stands in the southeast.</p>
        <p>Biologists, including Dr. White, said this would be acceptable if the highland forests were added to the reserve. For the logging companies, the highlands present significant logistical challenges in any case, requiring expensive road construction and costly harvesting methods.</p>
        <p>The lesson in all this, Dr. White says, is that when forests are carefully studied, the priorities of biologists and loggers do not always clash. Dr. White said the lands and water minister, Mr. Onouviet, had approved a national forest inventory aimed at identifying other spots to protect and eventually turning them into a network of national parks.</p>
        <p>None of this guarantees success, Dr. White noted, adding that for the moment Gabon's wildlife agency had only 13 staff members for a country the size of Colorado.</p>
        <p>But he said he was confident that he had shifted away from politics and bargaining sessions and returned to field work on mammals, this time outside the forests entirely.</p>
        <p>''It turns out there is a large population of humpback whales breeding off the coast of Gabon,'' he said in a telephone interview, just before heading off to fly over the ocean to try to spot them.</p>
