        <p>Stock prices moved higher yesterday, led upward by bellwether technology issues, which took a beating for most of last week.</p>
        <p>''The technology and telecommunications market was oversold,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index rose 103.99 points, or 2.8 percent, to 3,766.99, with Intel, Cisco Systems and Oracle increasing. The gain, the first in four sessions, reversed a bit of last week's 11 percent slide in the Nasdaq index. For the month, the Nasdaq fell 5 percent. So far this year, it is down 7.4 percent.</p>
        <p>Strong performances from financial stocks like Citigroup, meanwhile, pulled the Dow Jones industrial average up by 10.81 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,521.98. Consumer stocks like Wal-Mart and Procter &amp; Gamble fell, limiting the rise in the Dow.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.94 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,430.83.</p>
        <p>Despite the gains, analysts and traders said major market averages were likely to remain with a small range for most of this week, and possibly the balance of the summer.</p>
        <p>Specifically, they said that economic reports due out Friday, especially employment data for July, will be crucial determinants of how stocks perform between now and Labor Day.</p>
        <p>''Everything up to Friday is pretty much noise,'' said Bob Gasser, head of United States equity trading at J. P. Morgan &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>''But Friday is critical. That data released then has the ability to swing consensus about what the Federal Reserve Board will do at the end of the month in one direction, or the other.''</p>
        <p>Fed policy makers are scheduled to meet on Aug. 22 to determine if short-term interest rates need to be pushed higher. Last month Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told lawmakers that economic data to be released over the next few weeks would determine the course selected by the central bank.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to have conviction in a market like this,'' said Philip S. Dow, a managing director in equity research at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>Among individual stocks, Cisco Systems, which fell nearly 8 percent last week, gained 2 5/8 yesterday, to 65 7/16. Intel, which had a decline of 6.6 percent last week, rose 2 3/16 yesterday, to 66 3/4. The price reflects a 2-for-1 stock split that was effective yesterday.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Steady  By Reuters</p>
        <p>Treasury bond prices were little changed in a quiet session yesterday with most investors on the sidelines awaiting details of coming government borrowing needs and important economic data, both expected later in the week.</p>
        <p>Traders said Treasuries, which have been hemmed in a narrow range since early June, largely ignored reports on regional manufacturing conditions in Chicago and New York. An outright purchase of Treasury securities dated Aug. 15, 2005, to May 15, 2016 kept a floor under the market, they added.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 103 12/32. The note's yield remained at 6.03 percent.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 106 20/32. The bond's yield remained at 5.78 percent.</p>
