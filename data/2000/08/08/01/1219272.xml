        <p>For the second time this summer, the Asian long-horned beetle has been found in an area previously thought to be uninfested, Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said yesterday.

        <p>At least three beetle-infested trees, all red maples, will be removed in the next few days, officials said. But Joseph P.

        <p>For the second time this summer, the Asian long-horned beetle has been found in an area previously thought to be uninfested, Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said yesterday. The beetle, which has destroyed nearly 3,000 city trees, was discovered last week in the Queens Zoo in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.</p>
        <p>At least three beetle-infested trees, all red maples, will be removed in the next few days, officials said. But Joseph P. Gittleman, the director of the federal Department of Agriculture's inspection service, said he expected the final count to be much higher. ''We still don't know if this is the center of the infestation or an outlying area,'' Mr. Gittleman said.</p>
        <p>The only way to fight the beetle is to cut down infested trees, then chip and burn them. The beetle prefers maples, but also attacks horse chestnuts, black locusts, elms, birches, willows, poplars and green ash. It has also been found on Long Island, in Chicago and near the New York-Connecticut border.</p>
        <p>The new area of infestation falls between quarantine zones in Bayside, Queens, and Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which were established last year when beetles were found there. The quarantine zones, whose boundaries are one and a half miles from the nearest infestation, are set by state and city agricultural officials and are expected to be expanded to reflect the new infestation. All trees felled within the zones must be burned inside their boundaries.</p>
        <p>It is not known how the beetle moved to the park, but Mr. Stern suggested that it hitched a ride along the Grand Central Parkway, which runs along the infested area.</p>
        <p>The new infestation was discovered when a zookeeper found one of the distinctive beetles, which are black with gray speckles, on a maintenance path on the east side of the zoo, said Louis Matarazzo, the zoo horticulturist.</p>
        <p>A search led to a nearby red maple, Mr. Matarazzo said. When the federal inspector showed up, Mr. Matarazzo showed him a jar of 20 beetles collected by zoo employees. ''When he saw it, he was just shocked,'' Mr. Matarazzo said.</p>
        <p>In late June, the beetles were found in Norway maples on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The most serious infestations have been found in Greenpoint.</p>
        <p>The Asian long-horned beetle lays its eggs under the bark of trees, particularly maples, where they are beyond the reach of pesticides. When the eggs hatch, the larvae carve through the tree, boring exit holes about the diameter of a pencil. The holes, which appear in July, are one of the few signs of infestation.</p>
        <p>But by the time the holes appear, the beetles have already moved on. That is why some environmentalists have said the city should cut down not only infested trees, but also healthy trees nearby.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern has rejected that suggestion, saying it would involve ''killing tens of thousands of innocent trees.'' Yesterday, he said the Parks and Recreation Department was not reconsidering its strategy. This year, $10 million in city, state and federal money has been budgeted to fight the beetles.</p>
        <p>''The existing quarantine zones have worked,'' he said, acknowledging that additional infected trees have been found. He said tree inspectors recently began using bucket trucks to inspect potentially infested areas near the tops of trees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said anyone who sees signs of the beetles should call (800) 201-PARK.</p>
