        <p>Pearson P.L.C., which has been on an acquisition tear over the last two years, said yesterday that it was buying National Computer Systems Inc. for $2.5 billion in cash.</p>
        <p>The purchase of National Computer, the largest scorer of student assessment tests in the United States, is part of Pearson's expansion into educational publishing. National Computer had a profit of $43 million for the fiscal year ended Jan. 29 on sales of $630 million.</p>
        <p>Pearson, which also owns The Financial Times, already has extensive education holdings, the centerpiece of which is the textbook publisher Simon &amp; Schuster. The addition of National Computer would allow the company to offer a package of services that permits schools and parents to monitor the performance of students and organize remedial work for home and classrooms.</p>
        <p>Several analysts said yesterday that while they supported efforts by Pearson's chief executive, Marjorie Scardino, to expand the company's role in textbook and educational publishing, they were concerned about the structure of the deal, which offers existing stockholders the right to buy some additional shares at about half their value based on Friday's closing price.</p>
        <p>Pearson is paying $73 a share in cash, a 26 percent premium to National Computer's closing price on Friday. Yesterday, National Computer rose $13.75, to $71.875. Pearson is raising $2.56 billion through a rights offering that allows shareholders to buy 3 new shares of Pearson at $:10, or about $15, each, for every 11 shares they already own. Shares of Pearson closed on Friday at $:20.10, or $30.13.</p>
        <p>The American depository receipts of Pearson were unchanged yesterday at $31.50. Pearson has 625 million A.D.R.'s outstanding, and the company has filed to issue additional shares, which it expects to list on the New York Stock Exchange within the next several weeks.</p>
        <p>Some analysts and investors were not happy with the strategy of issuing new stock at a discount to complete the purchase. Shares of Pearson fell 9 percent, to $:18.28, or $27.40, in London yesterday.</p>
        <p>The company said that the stock strategy would make the acqusition price lower because it would reduce investment banking fees. It would also reduce the amount of additional debt Pearson would have to take on, and the company acknowledged yesterday that it was not eager to increase its debt load.</p>
        <p>One industry executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he found the price Pearson was paying -- roughly four times sales -- a high one. A spokesman for Ms. Scardino said she was not returning phone calls because the company was in a quiet period associated with its pending stock registration in the United States.</p>
        <p>Behind the rush to expand in educational publishing and information is increasing demand as more students enter United States schools. At the same time, schools are investing more in textbooks, in part because of swelling state coffers and in part because of the public demand for better education. For example, California will invest $1 billion over the next four years on education, said Ed Atorino, who follows publishing for Wasserstein Perella.</p>
        <p>''On top of that there is a technology play,'' he said. ''Schools are not only spending on textbooks, they are spending on software and CD-ROM's. It started in high school, but it is working its way down.''</p>
        <p>Pearson is not the only company determined to expand in educational publishing. In late June, the Washington Post Company announced that it would buy the Quest Education Corporation for $165 million. Quest provides career-oriented education to more than 13,400 students.</p>
        <p>THE MEDIA BUSINESS  Correction:  August 7, 2000, Monday  An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the purchase of National Computer Systems Inc. by Pearson P.L.C. misstated Pearson's relationship to Simon &amp; Schuster. Pearson acquired Simon &amp; Schuster's educational publishing operation in 1998; Viacom owns the Simon &amp; Schuster trade publishing operation and the name.</p>
