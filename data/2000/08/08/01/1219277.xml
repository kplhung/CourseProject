        <p>Joe Valley was packing boxes for a living, working six days a week at a warehouse in Queens. James Heekin was running his own moving business in Westchester County. Lauren Caldarera was studying anthropology in Kenya, and Carol McKeown was a nanny for a famous talk-radio host in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>But all four yearned for more fulfilling work, jobs that would change not only their own lives, but those of many others. So they dropped what they were doing last month, after learning that they had been accepted into a new program that would send 350 people with little or no teaching experience to work in New York City's most troubled schools this fall.</p>
        <p>''It's a matter of being able to do something meaningful,'' Mr. Heekin, 53, said yesterday as the program's teachers began five weeks of training. ''Moving is a service and people need it, but you don't feel much of an accomplishment at the end of it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Heekin, who lives in Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., and the other teaching fellows, many of whom have spent years in other professions, are the kinds of people that the school system is turning to as it prepares for a severe shortage of qualified teachers. One-third of the city's 75,000 teachers are either uncertified or nearing retirement age, and the teachers' colleges in New York State produce only about 20,000 new teachers a year, most of whom do not stay in the state.</p>
        <p>The State Board of Regents paved the way for the program last month when it voted to create an alternative certification route for teachers. Any college graduate with at least a 3.0 grade point average can apply to the program, and the New York City Board of Education has received more than 2,300 applications from around the country. The new route will allow people from other professions to enter teaching, as long as they earn the equivalent of an education degree in evening, weekend and summer classes over two years.</p>
        <p>New York City's teaching fellows will receive the starting teacher salary of $31,910, and the city will pay for them to get master's degrees in education and provide other support, including mentors. They will need the help; the 99 failing schools where they will work, mostly in Brooklyn and the Bronx, have the highest teacher turnover rates in the city.</p>
        <p>Ms. McKeown, who was a nurse, counselor and office administrator before becoming a nanny, said her experience in other fields would make her a better teacher. She said that she had wanted to teach in the past, but had always assumed she could not because she lacked the proper credentials.</p>
        <p>''I've jumped around a lot, so it will be great to focus on something really valuable to the community,'' said Ms. McKeown, 48, who lives in Brooklyn and asked that the radio host she worked for remain anonymous. ''Now that I'm older, I will be willing to ask for help rather than just stumble through. And I'm more creative than I've ever been.''</p>
        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, who abandoned a career in corporate law to head the school system, has described the teaching fellows program as one of his pet projects, saying that ambitious, talented people from other fields could be an asset to the school system and bring fresh ideas. Mr. Levy's voice broke with emotion yesterday as he addressed the 350 prospective teachers at their first orientation session at La Guardia High School on the Upper West Side, thanking them for taking on the challenge.</p>
        <p>''You're not in it for the money; you're not in it for the glory,'' Mr. Levy told them. ''You're in it because you have a sense of duty. I cannot thank you enough.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Levy's speech, the teaching fellows listened to veteran teachers discuss their experiences in the classroom, began filling out the thick stacks of paperwork that every new teacher has to complete, studied the subway maps tucked into their orientation packets and asked nonstop questions. Would they be eligible for deferments on old student loans? Would they get Labor Day off? What happens if they fail the state certification exam, which most will take on Aug. 19? (They can take it again.)</p>
        <p>''I really have no idea about the New York City schools,'' said Ms. Caldarera, 23, who moved from Houston on Friday and is living with relatives in Queens while she looks for an affordable apartment. ''I'm going into this blind.''</p>
        <p>Roughly 15 percent of the teaching fellows, including Ms. Caldarera, graduated from college this year. But most are in their 30's and 40's and have tried at least one other profession. There are slightly more women than men; about two-thirds are white, though they will be teaching in a system where more than 80 percent of the students are minority. Most will teach elementary school, but about 60 will teach mathematics, science, social studies and English in middle and high schools.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was the start of the five-week ''boot camp.'' The teaching fellows will observe summer school classes, spend seven hours a day in graduate courses at the City University of New York, discuss and practice different teaching methods and study for the state certification exam. The fellows will take courses all year at Brooklyn College, Lehman College in the Bronx and City College in Harlem.</p>
        <p>Vicki Bernstein, an assistant to Mr. Levy who is overseeing the program, said it would cost at least $10,000 per person, or a total of $3.5 million over two years.</p>
        <p>Many teaching fellows interviewed yesterday said that the Board of Education's offer to pay their graduate school tuition was a huge incentive for signing up, along with an application process far simpler than the bewildering system normally used for prospective teachers. The board is also paying about $200 for each fellow to take the licensing exam.</p>
        <p>''This was so simple because they gave us an 800 number to call that gave us all the information we needed,'' said Mr. Valley, 58, the warehouse worker, who taught math for 30 years in Trinidad before moving to New York three years ago. Mr. Valley, who lives in Jamaica, Queens, said that before the new program, he went to the Board of Education's personnel office at least six times to apply for a teaching job, but was so intimidated by the bureaucracy that he gave up.</p>
        <p>James Fogel, a lawyer who used to be a Criminal Court judge in the Bronx, said he would not have applied to teach if it had not been for the streamlined application process. Mr. Fogel, who graduated from Harvard with a physics degree in 1971, said he decided to try teaching at 49 because ''now it's the socially responsible thing to do, to go into the schools and teach math.'' Mr. Fogel, who lives in Riverdale, the Bronx, has three children and will be paying one child's college tuition for the first time this year. He said he would be paid about 90 percent less than he was making as a lawyer, but added that he could afford it at this stage of his life.</p>
        <p>''The stock market is doing well, my wife is a lawyer, I've been practicing law for 25 years,'' he said. ''So at this point, I can afford to take what is in essence a volunteer job.''</p>
