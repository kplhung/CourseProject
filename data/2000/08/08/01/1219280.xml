        <p>A Start-Up Recruits People To Donate DNA to Science  A California start-up, DNA Sciences, is introducing a Web site that will recruit people to donate their DNA to help find genes that cause disease. The company hopes to get 50,000 to 100,000 people to contribute to its ''gene trust'' by appealing to their altruism.</p>
        <p>The new effort reflects a big change taking place in genetics. Studies to link genes to disease are starting to be conducted on an unprecedented scale. While such studies promise to lead to big medical advances, the collection of genetic data on such a wide scale is also raising ethical and privacy issues. [Page A1.]</p>

        <p>Pearson to Buy National Computer  Pearson said that it was buying National Computer Systems, the largest scorer of student assessment tests in the United States, for $2.5 billion in cash. Several analysts said that while they supported efforts by Pearson's chief executive, Marjorie Scardino, to expand the company's role in educational publishing, they were concerned about the structure of the deal, which offers existing stockholders the right to buy some additional shares at a significant discount. Shares of Pearson fell 9 percent, to $:18.28, or $27.40. National Computer rose $13.75, to $71.875. [C11.]</p>

        <p>E-Tale Said to Be Near Break-Even  A week into the horror writer Stephen King's closely watched experiment with self-publishing over the Internet, Mr. King said that he was about to break even.

        <p>FPL Group Agrees to Buy Entergy  FPL Group, the parent of Florida Power and Light, agreed to acquire Entergy for about $7 billion in stock in a deal that would create the nation's largest electric company. But the news sent shares of FPL lower, reducing the original value of the deal, on disappointment that FPL was not the takeover target.
