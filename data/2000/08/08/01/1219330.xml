        <p>It is a charge Steve Phillips has disputed for months. The Mets need more left-handed hitters, the refrain goes, because they have only one in their starting lineup.</p>
        <p>Phillips, the Mets' general manager, does not think this is a problem, and he notes that several right-handed Mets actually hit better against right-handed pitchers. After the nonwaiver trading deadline passed yesterday, Phillips said he did not talk about acquiring a left-handed hitter who would have played regularly.</p>
        <p>Phillips did ask Baltimore repeatedly about the left-handed hitter B. J. Surhoff, who wound up being dealt to the Atlanta Braves. But Surhoff had a no-trade clause that prohibited the Orioles from trading him to the Mets. Phillips wanted Syd Thrift, the Orioles' vice president for baseball operations, to ask Surhoff to change his mind.</p>
        <p>''Poor Syd,'' Phillips said. ''I called Syd probably about four different times and said, 'Syd, just go talk to him and see if he'll change his mind about us being on his no-trade list.' But Surhoff had said no, he didn't want to be traded.''</p>
        <p>The Mets and the Orioles did complete a minor league deal, as the Mets sent the Class AAA starter Anthony Shumaker to Baltimore for Juan Aracena, a right-handed reliever, who was assigned to Class AA Binghamton. But Surhoff went to the Mets' division rival, and that was somewhat deflating for Phillips.</p>
        <p>''That would not have been our first preference,'' Phillips said. ''That's a great addition to Atlanta, no question. That's a great pickup for the Braves.''</p>
        <p>Trades are still possible after the nonwaiver deadline. The Mets landed reliever Turk Wendell this way, in a six-player deal with the Chicago Cubs in August 1997. But the best opportunity to make trades is over, and with last Friday's additions of shortstop Mike Bordick, reliever Rick White and outfielder Bubba Trammell, Manager Bobby Valentine is more comfortable.</p>
        <p>''Mike's experience and his ability alleviate a lot of doubt,'' Valentine said. ''And also there's a lot less little fires that I have to put out amongst the guys that might have occurred had he not been here.''</p>
        <p>Phillips said he could have made deals that would have strengthened some positions at the expense of others. He looked into potential deals for Milwaukee outfielder Jeromy Burnitz and Texas reliever John Wetteland, who were not available, as well as deals for starters Pedro Astacio of Colorado and Matt Clement of San Diego.</p>
        <p>In the end, the Mets stood pat, and to Phillips, that was fine.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we have any obvious holes right now,'' he said.</p>
