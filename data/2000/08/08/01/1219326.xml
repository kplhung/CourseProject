        <p>Republican Party elders and tacticians seemed to be spending much of the day yesterday appearing on every channel with more than a dozen viewers, talking about how to project an upbeat, temperate persona for the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>''We hardly ever mention Clinton-Gore,'' Gov. Tommy B. Thompson of Wisconsin told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell. ''We're talking about moving forward.''</p>
        <p>For the most part, they seemed to pull it off. As far as television cameras were concerned, nothing but happy faces inhabited the Magic Kingdom, otherwise known as Philadelphia's First Union Center.</p>
        <p>''We're thrilled to be here and my husband and I are excited about the future of the party,'' Cindy McCain, wife of Gov. George W. Bush's chief primary opponent, told MSNBC. ABC had outfitted Ms. McCain with a video camera and was planning to regularly show portions of her ''video diary'' during the four-day gathering. Not surprisingly, much of the early footage featured her husband.</p>
        <p>Keeping in touch with the convention yesterday was, for the most part, a cable television and Internet activity. Among commercial broadcast networks, only ABC offered even one hour of coverage last night. NBC directed viewers to its MSNBC cable cousin. And CBS mixed its convention coverage into Monday's episode of ''48 Hours,'' which was described in the Sunday television guide of The Los Angeles Times' as: ''Dan Rather presents live coverage of the Republican National Convention; abuse of human test subjects in medical experiments.''</p>
        <p>For those who ventured to cable or the Internet, though, the news was happy, happy, happy.</p>
        <p>Moderate Republicans, like Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, said  they were delighted that the party was opening its arms to independents. And conservatives, like the evangelist Pat Robertson, said they were happy, too. ''I'm quite pleased that the man I backed in the primaries is the nominee of the party,'' Mr. Robertson told Fox's Brit Hume.</p>
        <p>Democratic officials tried to put their own spin on it, but didn't seem to be getting much traction. ''You are going to see an effort to mask the face of the Republican Party,'' Mayor Marc Morial of New Orleans told Oliver L. North on ''Equal Time.'' Mr. North and the other guest, Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, just laughed.</p>
        <p>The result was that reporters and commentators -- there are 15,000 journalists representing 1,700 news organizations -- were forced to look elsewhere for drama, or to supply it in the traditional way, by arguing among themselves. There was plenty of that. Some inserted quickie features on the Reform Party, which seemed to be coming apart in a battle to eject Patrick J. Buchanan as its candidate.</p>
        <p>Others just tried a different tack.</p>
        <p>CBS gave us a tour of the Main Line, the suburban stretch west of the city, and said it had ''discovered'' that the district was named for the rail line that runs through it. CNN talked about the party scene. Apparently, the hot ticket on Sunday night was a bash by the Bloomberg News Service, although another headlined by Representative J. C. Watts Jr., in which the Oklahoman sang with the Temptations, was a close second. Last night, the place to be was the party for Senator John McCain.</p>
        <p>Some networks decided that the relatively slow news day -- when the chief speakers were Laura Bush, the candidate's wife, and retired Gen. Colin L. Powell -- was a good time to hook up with individual delegates and follow them around.</p>
        <p>On the British Broadcasting Corporation's Web site, the convention  was not even one of the five top stories, relegated instead to a digest at the bottom of the opening page (under ''Americas''). But it did offer a helpful guide on ''how to elect a U.S. president.'' Done in the form of a baseball diamond, the cheeky devils showed how a candidate must move from first base (primaries), to second (the convention), third (campaign) and finally home (Election Day).</p>
        <p>The Web site also offered a quiz, asking when the last time was a Republican ticket did not include a Bush or a Dole (1972) and when a woman first addressed a Republican convention (1920). A score of 9 out of 10 meant ''you should get a job running a political campaign.''</p>
        <p>Great. What's second prize?</p>
