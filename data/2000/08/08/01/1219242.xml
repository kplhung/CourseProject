        <p>A state judge barred the Yankees yesterday from proceeding with a plan for a cable television network because the team failed to give Madison Square Garden Network a legitimate chance to retain its right to carry Yankee games beyond this season.</p>
        <p>The judge, Barry A. Cozier of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, granted MSG's request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the Yankees and International Management Group from consummating plans to form the New York Sports Network.</p>
        <p>However, the order does not keep the Yankees from making a different deal with I.M.G. or anyone else that would comply with MSG's contract.</p>
        <p>In its current Yankee deal, which expires after this season, MSG owns the right of last refusal to match any offer the team receives from a third party, like I.M.G., to ''exploit, or otherwise, exploit itself, Yankees' games commencing with the 2001 baseball season.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees interpret exploitation broadly, to go beyond rights deals like the one it now has with MSG, to include a network of its own that would sell advertising and sponsorships and eventually televise Nets and Devils games.</p>
        <p>Justice Cozier ruled that the Yankees erred by offering MSG the 5 percent stake that Trans World International, a division of I.M.G., would own.</p>
        <p>Under that plan, the Yankees would own the remaining 95 percent, and collect $899 million in fees from from 2001 to 2010, including $65 million next season. The partners also contemplate that the network will go public. If that happens, it will go forward in a different ownership structure.</p>
        <p>Cozier ruled that the Yankees' offer of 5 percent of the network to MSG violates MSG's right to continue to exploit 100 percent of the television carriage of 150 games, which are now seen on MSG and Channel 5.</p>
        <p>In his ruling, Cozier said: ''The Yankees are offering 5 percent and calling it a full loaf. You cannot convert a 100 percent interest to a 5 percent interest. It is not an alternative that MSG can match or make a counteroffer. It would be impossible for MSG to match the offer since the Yankees' 95 percent interest hasn't been offered.''</p>
        <p>If the Yankees make an offer that complies with MSG's rights, Cozier said, ''Then it's up to MSG to match or reject.''</p>
        <p>After the decision, Yankee officials said Cozier had provided a path to resolve the dispute. Lonn Trost, the Yankees' general counsel, said: ''He was quite explicit in saying the Yankees were free to exploit their rights as they saw fit and we were free to launch our own network. The only issue the court had was that we must offer MSG 100 percent of what we initiate, not 5 percent.''</p>
        <p>Trost and Harvey Schiller, chairman of YankeeNets, the Yankees' parent company, insisted the injunction does not compel them to offer MSG 100 percent of what the network has now, although they were vague about any options.</p>
        <p>''What they had before was a rights deal,'' Trost said. ''Our only obligation is to offer them 100 percent of the right to exploit the Yankees' exploitation rights, which may not be in the form they have it now.''</p>
        <p>Trost also said the Yankees have not decided to appeal the injunction.</p>
        <p>Cozier instructed the Yankees to place a monetary value on the proposed venture with Trans World International. The Yankees, in concert with an investment banker, could put such an extraordinary value on the exploitation of Yankee TV rights and the future value of a network that MSG would be unwilling to match it.</p>
        <p>If MSG were to match the 100 percent ''exploitation value,'' it would own the network outright and the Yankees would emerge with far more than the $486 million they collected under their MSG deal, which began in 1989.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, said he was gratified that Cozier ''upheld our position, ensuring that the Yankees partnership will fulfill its contractual obligations regarding MSG Network's right of last refusal.''</p>
        <p>Both sides said they would begin talks soon. But Schiller said, without any elaboration, that the ruling had brought in ''new opportunities from many new interested parties'' to the YankeeNets office.</p>
        <p>The longer the dispute takes to resolve, the less time the Yankees will have to set up the network, which must make deals to be carried by cable systems, like Cablevision, MSG's principal owner.</p>
        <p>''I personally believe there will be good acceptance among the cable carriers,'' Schiller said. ''We don't want anyone to be in a position to prevent the public from watching our games.''</p>
