        <p>CURIOUS facts for curious folks:</p>
        <p>Did you know a disproportionate number of people in the drug policy movement are left-handed?</p>
        <p>We didn't either, but Ethan Nadelmann says so. He happens to be Mr. Drug Policy Movement -- and left-handed.</p>
        <p>''Left-handed people learn from an early age what it's like to be deviant, and that it's O.K.,'' enthused Mr. Nadelmann, 43, a gung-ho guy -- ''do you mind if I pace?'' -- who was holding forth in his book-lined Manhattan office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nadelmann, who has degrees in law and political science from Harvard and is a former Princeton professor, is the much-admired and much-repudiated critic of recent administrations' wars on drugs. Over the years, his left hand has been clasped by a small, powerful and eclectic group of thinkers, including George Soros, the billionaire; Walter Cronkite, the former anchor; and George P. Shultz, the former secretary of state.</p>
        <p>His latest best friend is Arianna Huffington, the writer and saloniste, with whom he and others helped create this month's ''shadow conventions'' in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, to discuss issues like his, which, one may assume, will not be briskly considered at those other conventions.</p>
        <p>He had just been refereeing the in-fighting over the schedule of events today in Philadelphia, which will largely reflect his agenda.</p>
        <p>''About 150 people told me they want to speak,'' said Mr. Nadelmann, who pops up on talk shows when the host needs a respectable flamethrower. ''I'm getting calls saying, 'How come you don't have the hemp issue or the C.I.A. drug-conspiracy issue?'</p>
        <p>''We're a lightning rod for people who oppose us as well as for people who don't feel heard. Yeah, we have our lunatic fringe, but we also have a lot of remarkable people who are smart and menschy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nadelmann, who sees the drug wars as a pricey flop, argues that drug-related crimes and prison overcrowding will be eased if offenders are sent to treatment, marijuana is legalized for adults, and ''harm reduction'' programs, like heroin maintenance, are encouraged.</p>
        <p>He has an affinity for startling comparisons, likening his ''antiwar movement,'' with its focus on how drug laws affect minorities, to the early days of the civil or gay rights movements. A divorced father, he tells his 11-year-old daughter that his job is ''to change bad laws.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Nadelmann does more than debate anyone who bumps into him. He founded the Lindesmith Center, a project of Mr. Soros's Open Society Institute, dedicated to changing drug policy. He advises Mr. Soros on the allocation of about $7 million a year in grants, and had a big hand in initiatives allowing marijuana to be dispensed for medical purposes, passed in a half-dozen states, including California and Maine.</p>
        <p>''I don't think adults should be punished for what they put into their bodies,'' he said.</p>
        <p>HE has the cocksure confidence of one who not only believes that, as he put it, he is doing the Lord's work, but who is effective enough to be cast as something of an antichrist by critics from Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the Clinton administration's drug czar, to Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, the president of Phoenix House Foundation, the drug treatment program.</p>
        <p>Like his father, a Westchester Country rabbi from the American Reconstructionist movement, Mr. Nadelmann has long been attracted to novel, modern ideas. In his earlier graduate school years, he bounded onto the relatively untrod discipline of international law enforcement. Consulting with the State Department's narcotics bureau, he studied how agents pursue money laundering that crosses borders. For academic work, he interviewed drug enforcement agents in 19 countries.</p>
        <p>His interests turned toward drug policy. Around 1987, as Nancy Reagan was saying just say no, he wrote articles begging to differ.</p>
        <p>Did you just say yes?</p>
        <p>He grinned coyly. ''What's the best way to answer this?'' he replied, and then described youthful experimentation with drugs.</p>
        <p>And now?</p>
        <p>''I won't go into more details because I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't,'' he said. ''People will say, 'You just advocate for this because you use,' and if I say I don't, people will say, 'Then you don't know what you're talking about.' ''</p>
        <p>He doesn't spend much time speaking with users on the street, although, with a guide, he would take Princeton students on a field trip to a shooting gallery. On a recent vacation in Europe, he said, ''I went to visit a little heroin prescription room in Amsterdam. I biked over there and it was a nice day.''</p>
        <p>As good as he is at private persuasion -- today's roster includes the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson as well as Gov. Gary E. Johnson of New Mexico, a Republican -- Mr. Nadelmann enjoys the spotlight on himself.</p>
        <p>''I have a huge admiration for a Dennis Ross'' -- the American Middle East envoy -- ''but he's behind the scenes,'' he said. ''I do a lot of peacemaking and reconciliation, too, but there's a part of me that loves public speaking.</p>
        <p>''My dad was an emotional speaker. He'd cry on the pulpit and I inherited a large share of that. I never know the first word that will come out of my mouth. But I'm a very good speaker and I can move people. I'm a good writer, too, but I don't quite have the discipline to sit down.''</p>
