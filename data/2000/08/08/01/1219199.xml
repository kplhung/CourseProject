        <p>Swinging onstage at Broadway's New Amsterdam Theater, Christopher Jackson belts out his opening number in the musical ''The Lion King'' while suspended by a rope 25 feet above the audience.</p>
        <p>As Simba, a role for which he is the understudy and will take over permanently this month, he must convincingly move with the strength and grace of the lion he portrays.</p>
        <p>Down the block at the Martin Beck Theater, Michael Berresse woos his leading lady in the revival of ''Kiss Me, Kate'' by lithely scaling a three-story balcony like a kid on a jungle gym.</p>
        <p>These days the Broadway musical's modern choreography is far more rigorous and physical than the song and dance era of Ethel Merman or Carol Channing.</p>
        <p>''It's much more athletic and aerobic,'' said Kathleen Marshall, the choreographer. ''You have the phenomenon of people going to the gym, developing stronger, leaner silhouettes and more muscular bodies.''</p>
        <p>More strength means more opportunities for choreographers to create challenging routines that highlight a performer's skills.</p>
        <p>Knowing Mr. Berresse's background as a gymnast and diver, Ms. Marshall crafted the climbing sequence in ''Kiss Me, Kate'' with him in mind.</p>
        <p>''I've always been very physical and I've developed athletes' habits,'' Mr. Berresse said. ''In truth, Broadway dancers are professional athletes and they are finally being recognized as such.''</p>
        <p>Choreography may be faster and more hard-hitting because the world itself is moving faster than ever.</p>
        <p>''Just as records keep getting broken in sports and athletes run faster and jump higher than they did 30 years ago,'' Ms. Marshall said, ''dancers are able to do more, bringing a new level of athleticism to  their work.''</p>
        <p>A 1996 Olympic gymnast, Aliane Baquerot, made her Broadway debut this year as Linda Manero in ''Saturday Night Fever'' and says a disciplined sports background is a help in this almost nonstop dance show. ''You find a lot more acrobatics today instead of just traditional musical theater-type dance,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Manny Kladitis, a producer who has been involved with the theater since 1965 and is  producing ''Saturday Night Fever,'' traces the trend toward more physical theater to the resurgence of dance itself.</p>
        <p>''Dance and exercise bring on this rush that gets the audience going, the kind of physical and sexual energy you might get when you're exercising yourself,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Such brawny Broadway performances are not limited to dance, however, as evidenced by the strenuous climbing and mock fighting in the rock opera revival of ''Jesus Christ Superstar.'' Trained as a dancer with  the Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble, Lana Gordon, portraying dual roles as a Disciple and Herod's Girl, tackles her first nondance role with as much vigor as anything she has done en pointe. ''People want to see action,'' she said, describing a scene in which she hoists herself up a steep scaffold in one of the big numbers. ''They don't want to see you just standing around.''</p>
        <p>Preparing for the new demands requires more than the traditional voice and dance lessons and while most troupers get an ample aerobic workout eight times each week, strength training, stretching, yoga and even meditation play crucial roles. As a former fitness trainer, Mr. Jackson knows his way around a gym and trains a minimum of five times a week. ''It's a matter of survival to stay in tip-top shape,'' he said, recalling a knee injury that set him back three months. ''I train like an athlete because I perform like one.''</p>
        <p>As Tommy Djilas in ''The Music Man,'' Clyde Alves, recipient of this year's Fred Astaire Award for Outstanding Dance on Broadway, reaches into his own sports history as a wrestler and gymnast and soccer and hockey player to leap through his performance, capped by a particularly memorable spread-eagle jump over a young cast member. ''It takes more discipline to warm up and keep in shape than before,'' said Mr. Alves, whose warm-up includes push-ups, sit-ups and meditation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gordon finds yoga offers a good balance between mind and body, not to mention a tremendous vocal warm-up. She takes a class every day. And Pilates, the discipline of controlled stretching and toning exercises beloved by dancers, keeps a large proportion of performers limber and strong for the rigors of the theater.</p>
        <p>The line between performance and pumping iron continues to blur with the proliferation of Broadway-based aerobic classes cropping up in gyms across the country. Cast members from ''Chicago,'' ''Swing,'' ''Contact'' and ''Saturday Night Fever'' have all taught health club patrons choreography from the shows in Broadway dance series at fitness clubs.</p>
        <p>As he prepares to take over the lead in ''The Lion King,'' Mr. Jackson figures he'll need to put on 5 to 10 pounds over the next two months because of the show's intensity.  ''It's not unusual for me to drop a couple of pounds in just one show,'' he said.</p>
