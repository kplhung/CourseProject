        <p>For more than a century, the Franciscan friars have made the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center, set in a hilly swath of forest here, their world headquarters.</p>
        <p>Even today, much of Graymoor is like a page out of Chaucer, with whispering friars in brown robes and sandals strolling past abbey-style buildings. Though they may resemble their legendary jolly counterparts of yore, today's friars are hardly known for taking up a stiff cudgel for bandying errant knaves who refuse to yield the path.</p>
        <p>On occasion, however, they can be as fiercely territorial as their forefathers, and they are now fighting to keep a wooded 18-acre section of their property the National Park Service is trying to acquire.</p>
        <p>The parcel is adjacent to the Appalachian Trail, which runs through Graymoor's 400 acres of woods in Garrison, about an hour north of Manhattan, in Putnam County, and is used extensively by hikers.</p>
        <p>The Park Service, which oversees the 2,144-mile trail stretching from Maine to Georgia, says the friars could threaten one section of trail.</p>
        <p>But the friars say it is the Park Service that is encroaching and starting a land grab that could endanger the future of their ministries. So they are standing their ground.</p>
        <p>Graymoor, the world headquarters for the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement, was established in 1898. There are 45 friars and 86 nuns living there; they operate a retreat, a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center, an ecumenical institute and St. Christopher's Inn, a homeless shelter.</p>
        <p>Graymoor definitely has one foot in the past with its abbey-style buildings and wandering friars, but the friars now wear their robes over their street clothes, and their sandals are Birkenstocks. The Rev. Arthur M. Johnson, minister general of Graymoor, has a secretary and a computer in his fifth-floor office in the center's main administrative office building.</p>
        <p>The friars say that losing the parcel involved in the dispute would cripple their ministry in the future. Though the only building on the 18-acre parcel is a maintenance shed, the land is crucial to the maintenance of their complex, they say. Relinquishing rights to it would hinder maintenance of roadways and other buildings. Also, they say, the parcel is next to the center's sewage treatment plant, and surrendering it would hinder access to the plant and any expansion in the future.</p>
        <p>''We may have to take up archery again,'' Father Johnson said.</p>
        <p>His quip was only partly in jest. Instead of stout oaken staffs and longbows, the Graymoor friars are wielding slightly more modern weapons: a publicist and a lawyer.</p>
        <p>The Park Service already has an easement on 58 acres of the friars' property. But the friars said they did not learn until July that in May, the Park Service had asked the Justice Department to order the friars to sell the government an easement on 18 more acres as ''buffer land'' for the trail, under eminent domain, a legal procedure that allows governments to take land for the public good, like roadways and parks, at its fair market value. Neither the friars nor the government would say what the Park Service was offering, but both sides privately acknowledged that it was far less than $10,000 an acre.</p>
        <p>Father Johnson said the battle was not over money but over ''the principle that the federal government thinks it can come in and take over our land.'' Allowing the Park Service to have the parcel, he said, could open the floodgates to future government land acquisition.</p>
        <p>''Who's to say they won't come along next time and say they want more?'' he said, adding that the friars would consider challenging a forced acquisition in court.</p>
        <p>Edie Shean-Hammond, a spokeswoman for the northeast region of the National Park Service, said the agency was simply fulfilling its mandate from Congress to obtain any land it needs to ensure that the trail remains continuous.</p>
        <p>The relationship between the friars and the trail goes back to 1923, when they and the trail's organizers agreed to allow the path to cross an undeveloped wooded area along the eastern edge of the friars' property.</p>
        <p>In 1984, the Park Service wanted to move the trail, and paid $116,500 to acquire a formal easement of 58 acres, much closer to the friars' buildings. Since then, the Park Service has tried unsuccessfully to get the friars to give it an easement on the 18-acre parcel.</p>
        <p>Though the friars still technically own the property covered by the easement, they cannot build on it or sell it without permission from the Park Service.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shean-Hammond said that almost immediately after the friars sold the government the easement in 1984, they violated its terms by building a pump house for the sewage plant on it and by running pipes under the trail. The Park Service has decided to seek more of Graymoor's land to preclude a similar encroachment in the future, she said.</p>
        <p>Father Johnson called the construction of the pump house ''a miscalculation,'' but noted that the building is the size of a one-car garage and is barely visible from the trail.</p>
        <p>''With all due respect for the Franciscan friars, the land has been built on,'' Ms. Shean-Hammond said. ''And we have to ensure that it won't happen again.''</p>
        <p>''Our job is to protect that corridor,'' she added. ''In other cases, we have acted more immediately, but we recognize that the friars have been good hosts to the hikers.''</p>
        <p>She also voiced concern that the friars would someday sell the land to a private developer. Father Johnson said the friars had no immediate plans to do so, but he would not rule out such a sale in the future.</p>
        <p>The friars say they are friends of the trail and have always put up hikers without charge, often allowing them to camp overnight. Day hikers may park free, and the friars have built showers, toilets and a shed for them. Trail users may roam the entire Graymoor property, use the friars' library, and are invited to share dinner with the friars without charge. Some guide books call Graymoor the ''Hilton of the Appalachian Trail.''</p>
        <p>Representative Sue W. Kelly, a Republican whose Congressional district includes Garrison, wrote Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt asking him to have the Park Service drop the acquisition proceedings.</p>
        <p>Touring the property in a sport utility vehicle, Father Johnson said that despite its claims against the friars, the Park Service was the one encroaching on the property.</p>
        <p>''It's like inviting someone for the weekend,'' he said, ''and all of a sudden they stay and claim squatters' rights.''</p>
