        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Don't Shop, but Protest Till You Drop,'' by John Tierney (Big City column, July 25), about the closing of an Upper West Side supermarket and its replacement by a CVS drugstore:</p>
        <p>I write as the co-chairman of West Siders for Viable Neighborhoods. We of the ''secret little Napoleon complex'' will confine our response to two points.</p>
        <p>Regarding the charge that our protest represents a power play of some sort, we plead emphatically guilty.</p>
        <p>Neighborhood empowerment is exactly what the 3,500 signers of our petition and the 300 people who turned out at the community meeting are after: the right, and indeed the duty, of citizens to take part in the shaping of their civic environment.</p>
        <p>All the remaining food stores on the stretch of Broadway in the low 100's in question are owned by the same parent company. Their prices were higher before we lost our one competing supermarket, and they've gone up even higher since. Although paying 20 to 30 percent more for groceries may not be a big hardship for the affluent people who live west of Broadway, it is devastating to the budgets of low-income people living to the east.</p>
        <p>JOHN F. DAVENPORT  New York, July 28, 2000</p>
