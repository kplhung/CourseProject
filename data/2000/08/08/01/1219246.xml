        <p>Last summer, an accident at a local utility curtailed power to Owens Corning's plant in Kansas City, Kan., sending it scrambling to find alternative energy. It was a costly, nerve-racking experience.</p>
        <p>Since then the company has signed a 10-year contract with Enron Energy Services to buy electricity for its 20 largest United States plants, and has hired a sales manager from a Belgian utility to handle its electricity purchases in Europe.</p>
        <p>The Enron unit will negotiate the contracts and pay all the bills. But Owens Corning, a fiberglass maker with an annual electricity tab that tops $200 million, has also hired three energy specialists to help manage risk, reduce consumption and keep abreast of technologies.</p>
        <p>''Enron may be driving the car, but we're still in the front seat,'' said Charles E. Dana, vice president for global sourcing operations.</p>
        <p>There was a time, not so long ago, when buying electricity was a simple matter. The local utility was the only game in town, the state set the rates, there was little to do but sign on the dotted line.</p>
        <p>These days, not only are there myriad utilities and upstart energy companies to choose from, but countless permutations of ways to contract for electricity, including buying it on the Web.</p>
        <p>Different suppliers produce the electricity, transmit it and deliver it. Futures contracts, derivatives and negotiated rate caps all offer ways to hedge against wild swings in use, fuel costs -- a particularly germane consideration nowadays -- or other reasons for rates that soar and dip and soar again.</p>
        <p>Today's energy buyers must know how to predict weather and economic fluctuations as well as how to drive hard bargains. They must know how to find suppliers who will give them a cheaper rate if they switch some of their use from peak to night or other off-peak times -- and then, how to skew energy use so that it can make more use of that cheaper energy.</p>
        <p>''It's no longer the buying of the commodity that's important,'' said Carol H. Guthrie, group manager for Chevron U.S.A.'s electricity supply group. ''It's gathering all the information that allows you to buy it.''</p>
        <p>Thus, from metal smelters to property managers, from manufacturers to telecommunications companies, all kinds of companies are rethinking not only how they buy that critical electricity, but who is doing that buying, how much they are paid, even whom they report to.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying energy knowledge is a requirement for all jobs these days,'' said Robert H. Welsh, a senior partner at the executive recruiting firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles International, ''but if a candidate for chief technology officer also has energy experience, the client nods happily.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, many companies are pulling chief financial officers and chief technology officers into energy buying. Others are retraining and promoting engineers, accountants or particularly talented buyers. Still others are scouring the regulatory community, the utilities, even Wall Street for energy-knowledgeable people. And many are letting consultants seek out suppliers, negotiate contracts, even survey the company for ways to cut use.</p>
        <p>''Buying and selling energy has become a real financial play, and it needs someone with sophisticated knowledge of finance and energy both,'' said Bruce W. Peterson, a managing director at the executive recruiting firm Korn/Ferry International, who is searching for just such a person for a client.</p>
        <p>Such people do not come cheap. Doron Cohen, an energy specialist at the research firm Gartner, knows a vice president at a metals company who quit in a rage when he discovered that younger, newly hired energy buyers made more than he did.</p>
        <p>''The person who'll work for $60,000 doesn't have the knowledge you need, and you can't attract commodities traders unless bonuses and such give them a shot at making $1 million a year,'' Mr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>The competition and the inflated pay rates promise to worsen. Utilities, now that they are increasingly allowed to sell electricity in areas with wildly fluctuating climates and consumptions, are hiring traders to help lock in margins between the price of natural gas they buy and the possible prices of power they might sell.</p>
        <p>Companies like Enron Energy Services, which handle purchases for many clients and thus can more easily justify paying top dollar, have bid the price for the most experienced traders and energy specialists through the roof, offering packages of salary, bonus and equity that can hit $1.5 million a year.</p>
        <p>''Buying energy these days is all about managing risk and income statements,'' said Harold G. Buchanan, a managing director at Enron. ''We're more like an investment bank than a utility.''</p>
        <p>The result, for corporations, is sticker shock. ''The biggest challenge was to create that cultural shift in the client's mind, away from a $60,000 procurement guy to a $200,000 Wall Street professional who can hedge and contain costs and minimize risk,'' said Richard J. Preng, managing director of the global energy practice at the recruiting firm Spencer Stuart. He recently placed an energy supply chief at a metals company, for a pay package ''north of $300,000.''</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the answer for many companies is to pay consultants, not staff members. Corning, the optical cable supplier, used to have four energy buyers; it now has one, whose main job is to be a liaison with a subsidiary of Amerada Hess, which has taken over the company's energy programs.</p>
        <p>''Outsourcing lets us focus on the high-level management of energy,'' said Ernest J. Williams, Corning's director of procurement operations.</p>
        <p>The Rockefeller Group International, which owns several office buildings and industrial parks, saved $500,000 on electricity bills for two New York City skyscrapers when it hired John Flood, an energy consultant, to evaluate energy bids. Similarly, Rockefeller Group's Cushman &amp; Wakefield subsidiary now lets a consultant negotiate its electricity contracts at the dozens of buildings it manages. Frank A. Freda, a Cushman senior managing director, estimated that it had shaved $2.6 million off its energy tab in New York City; he is now using the company in other states.</p>
        <p>The ubiquitous Web has given rise to yet another form of third-party energy buyer: the auctioneer. The Public Service Enterprise Group's Energy Technologies unit in Edison, N.J., just teamed up with Enermetrix.com, a Web start-up, to run Internet auctions in which Public Service clients post total energy requirements, and energy suppliers bid to fill them.</p>
        <p>Still, corporate clients keep a close watch on the results. ''The energy buyers are looking at the bids, and I imagine that higher-level people are giving the final O.K. on the offers,'' said Frederick W. Lark, a vice president of Public Service.</p>
        <p>Indeed, energy is increasingly becoming an executive suite topic. KeySpan Energy's KeySpan Business Solutions unit, which designs and builds energy systems, counts among its clients a large shopping mall developer.</p>
        <p>''They used to let local construction managers write contracts with local utilities,'' said Anthony Sartor, KeySpan's president. ''Now they have an energy engineer who works with their C.F.O. to evaluate bids and finance the energy systems.''</p>
        <p>For commercial companies, reducing energy costs is a nicety. For manufacturers, whose energy tabs go into the multimillions, it is a necessity. Increasingly, such companies are recognizing that scrimping on energy expertise is penny-wise and pound-foolish.</p>
        <p>Hoffman-LaRoche, the drug giant in Nutley, N.J., that is part of Roche Holding in Switzerland, recently piggybacked onto an energy contract the New Jersey Chemical Industry Council had negotiated for its members with Allegheny Energy, an independent supplier. But Hoffman, unlike many companies on the contract, generates some of its own power. So John Parodi, a former utility executive who became Hoffman's senior energy manager three years ago, negotiated extra clauses.</p>
        <p>''I needed the provider to supply energy beyond what we generated ourselves, but also to cover us if our generators go down,'' Mr. Parodi said. He is now scouting out energy suppliers for Hoffman-LaRoche plants in other states.</p>
        <p>Even companies that have had energy experts for years are taking a fresh look at them.</p>
        <p>Since joining Chevron U.S.A. in 1994, Ms. Guthrie has reported first to the vice president in charge of refining operations, then to the vice president of a natural gas unit -- ''there was a perceived synergy in deregulatory processes,'' she explained -- and then again to a refining executive.</p>
        <p>In January, her group's name was changed from energy services to electricity supply, and Ms. Guthrie and her four subordinates report to the head of procurement. One goal is to whittle the number of suppliers.</p>
        <p>''Chevron has more than 130 electricity suppliers, and we want to look at procurement strategies that can span regions and products,'' Ms. Guthrie explained. Last week, Chevron announced that it had started Chevron Energy Services, a unit aimed at helping clients control their total energy costs as well.</p>
        <p>At Honeywell International, which spends upwards of $300 million a year on electricity, buyers are broadening their definition of energy. Honeywell's five specialists -- four of them added to the staff in the last four years -- have worked out contracts with suppliers of industrial gases in which the suppliers set up shop at a Honeywell plant and use some of its waste heat, steam and other sources of energy that might have been vented to the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>''Hydrogen and oxygen are really water and a lot of electricity,'' said William L. Ramsey, Honeywell's vice president for the supply chain. ''So it makes sense to work with industrial gas suppliers as though they were power generators.''</p>
        <p>As deregulation continues its slow creep from state to state, corporate energy czars are rising to prominence at companies that do not have energy-intensive manufacturing.</p>
        <p>Five years ago Bell Atlantic -- which merged with GTE in June, and is now Verizon Communications -- hired Jeremy Metz, a lawyer specializing in energy and environment, to head its energy procurement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Metz, using his regulatory expertise, has already saved the company millions by getting it included in every pilot program for deregulating energy in New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. And last year he hired another full-time buyer, someone with 20 years of experience buying generation equipment. ''I've got the legal and regulatory experience,'' Mr. Metz said. ''He understands the nuts and bolts of the energy world.''</p>
        <p>The company has pulled in operating people, too. Last year it formed Team Energy -- 12 people pulled from various operating groups and charged with looking for ways to economize on energy use. It has hired outside auditors to look for even more efficiencies. And it has put a link on its Web site that plant managers can use to monitor their electric bills.</p>
        <p>''A big part of my job was convincing the people who run our data centers or network operations that some newfangled power supplier is going to be reliable,'' Mr. Metz said. ''Now they're convinced, and they're ready to look for other opportunities to improve the way we use energy.''</p>
