        <p>In what officials say is a case of old-style discrimination in the new realm of cyberspace, a New Jersey landlord posted an Internet advertisement to rent apartments to ''whites only,'' a lawsuit charges.</p>
        <p>State officials filed the lawsuit against the landlord in State Superior Court here on July 25, under New Jersey civil rights and consumer protection laws. It charges that a black resident of New Jersey who was looking for an apartment in southern New Jersey came across the advertisement in the classifieds section of the Web portal Yahoo.</p>
        <p>It is the first time a lawsuit has been brought in New Jersey charging housing discrimination on the Internet, said Mark S. Herr, a deputy state attorney general who is director of the Division of Consumer Affairs. Mr. Herr said it was also the first time anyone in his office could recall seeing the phrase ''whites only'' outside a history book.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, we were all shocked when we saw this,'' said Mr. Herr, whose office has a special Internet crimes unit. ''Not because we are so naive as to think that discrimination does not exist, but that someone would be so bold as to say something was for ''whites only.''</p>
        <p>''The thing that we have learned doing five years of Internet prosecutions,'' he added, ''is that it is the wild, wild West, and there are people who believe that anything goes.''</p>
        <p>The suit seeks compensatory damages on behalf of the black resident, who was not identified. Mr. Herr said that the consumer and civil rights laws provided only for civil penalties, and that criminal charges would not be brought.</p>
        <p>The landlord was identified as Michael J. Matthews of Westfield. The  rental apartment in question is at 115 Medford-Mount Holly Road in Medford, a predominantly white suburb in Burlington County.</p>
        <p>According to the suit, Mr. Matthews posted the advertisement on April 17. The person who found the advertisement contacted the state, and undercover agents posing as would-be renters exchanged e-mail messages with Mr. Matthews arranging to view the apartment.</p>
        <p>When black agents showed up to view it, the suit asserts, Mr. Matthews told them the apartment was no longer available. But he offered white agents a lease, the suit charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Matthews has an unpublished phone number, and he did not respond to an e-mail message seeking comment. His lawyer, Peter Lange Jr., did not return calls.</p>
        <p>Yahoo said it does not review the content of classified advertisements. ''It's just an open platform, and it hasn't been a problem,'' a company spokeswoman said.</p>
