        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote mounted by opponents of his peace efforts today, but his heavily favored candidate for Israel's president, Shimon Peres, suffered a stunning defeat in the twilight of a long career.</p>
        <p>Instead, Parliament chose Moshe Katsav, a little-known Iranian-born lawmaker of the opposition Likud Party who began his political career as mayor of a small working-class desert town.</p>
        <p>Ariel Sharon, the hawkish, hard-line Likud leader was, as expected, unable to muster the 61-seat absolute majority in the 120-seat Parliament that was needed to topple the government. With Parliament scheduled to adjourn on Wednesday for its three-month vacation, the hard-pressed Mr. Barak now has a grace period to try to rebuild his tattered coalition and push for some form of resumption of the talks that stalled at Camp David.</p>
        <p>The vote this evening seemed almost anticlimactic. It followed three hours of heated debate -- relatively short by the Israeli Parliament's standards -- with speakers interrupted by rowdy, hand-waving shouts and insults from the floor. The votes cast were exactly 50 to 50, with 8 abstentions and 12 members simply disappearing, casting no votes.</p>
        <p>But it was far from a victory for Mr. Barak, who now must piece together a coalition in the fragmented Parliament from small parties -- religious, secular, nationalist, liberal and others -- whose interests are often at sharp odds. The vote suggested that many members simply wanted to avoid calling new elections for fear they would lose their seats.</p>
        <p>''The only thing that is sustaining the prime minister is that the Knesset members do not want, at this time, to go to elections within 90 days,'' said Israel radio's chief political analyst, Yaron Dekel. He added that Mr. Peres' defeat was ''a severe blow that can start a snowball effect that can lead to the downfall of his government -- this is a prime minister without a government.''</p>
        <p>A few hours later on Israeli television, after the no-confidence vote, Mr. Dekel said, ''This is the worst day for Barak since he was elected.''</p>
        <p>Much of the drama today centered on the vote for the largely honorary office of president. Mr. Peres, in an elegant dark suit and blue polka dot tie, wandered the Parliament chamber, ashen-faced, when it became clear that he would lose.</p>
        <p>The silver-haired Mr. Peres, three-time prime minister and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, lost to an earnest but colorless politician once known as the ''tolerant and polite'' member of Parliament.</p>
        <p>The blow was all the more shocking because every pundit in this intensely political country had called Mr. Peres a shoo-in. ''Peres Poised to Win Presidency'' was the main headline in The Jerusalem Post, while in Haaretz it was ''Peres confident of capturing Presidency.</p>
        <p>But when the envelopes in the secret ballot were opened in the first round of voting at midday, Mr. Katsav had 60 votes -- one short of victory -- while Mr. Peres had 53. Three ballots were blank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak and his One Israel floor leaders huddled, worried and baffled. Mr. Sharon's Likud supporters and the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic members of Shas grinned and, as the final vote showed Mr. Katsav with 63 votes, hugged and cried.</p>
        <p>It was a big win for Mr. Sharon, the first time the candidate sponsored by Likud was elected president. The election of Mr. Katsav was also seen as a product of the increasing challenge by Sephardic Jews -- largely of Middle Eastern origin -- to the traditional Ashkenazi European elite.</p>
        <p>And, in a long political career, Mr. Peres had also made enemies. It appeared that about five members of his own party voted against him in the secret ballot.</p>
        <p>Though prime ministers do not normally respond in person to a no-confidence motion, Mr. Barak had to attend today's session and listen to the scorn heaped on him because  Limor Livnat of Likud had taken the unusual step of getting 40 members' signatures requiring Mr. Barak's presence.</p>
        <p>In the debate today, Ms. Livnat, one of Likud's most forceful orators, shouted accusations at the prime minister, accusing him of making major concessions, then, ''you write a letter to Clinton stating that suddenly it has become clear to you that the Palestinians are not partners to the talks and they are not negotiating in good faith. For this we should say 'good morning, Elijah.' Finally you have discovered what we have known for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak sat through the lecture, making a few notes, with his usual half-smile.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon led off the Likud attack, accusing Mr. Barak of broken promises.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak responded by mounting the podium and saying: ''I appeal to each and every one of you and ask you to rise above petty politics.''</p>
        <p>He cited President Clinton's appearance on Israeli television on Friday, with its hints of moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem -- a sought-after dream here and a reversal of a 50-year policy. ''We strengthened Israel's international standing,'' he said. ''We removed it from international isolation.''</p>
        <p>At the heart of Mr. Barak's political problem is a 1996 change in electoral procedures providing for with separate voting for prime minister and members of Parliament. Although Mr. Barak won a strong mandate in May, 1999, defeating Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud with 56 percent of the vote, Mr. Barak has had to deal with a fragmented, unwieldy Parliament with many small parties.</p>
