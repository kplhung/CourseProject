        <p>As the Republican convention opened yesterday with appeals to a broad range of voters, Hillary Rodham Clinton warned voters not to be deceived by a what she described as a ''well-scripted show'' intended to conceal the party's extremist record.</p>
        <p>Speaking at the National Urban League's annual convention yesterday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton mocked Gov. George W. Bush's slogan of ''compassionate conservatism'' and used especially caustic language to criticize the Republicans for trying, in her view, to promote ''political amnesia.'' She also alluded to her opponent's connections to the policies favored at the top of the ticket.</p>
        <p>Without using the name of her opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, Mrs. Clinton scoffed at his efforts to present himself as moderate. For the first time in weeks, she linked Mr. Lazio to the reign of Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, a strategy she seized upon when Mr. Lazio entered the race but then quickly dropped.</p>
        <p>''He goes around calling himself mainstream,'' she said, mockingly stretching out both syllables. ''I guess his service as a deputy whip to Newt Gingrich is considered mainstream. We're all just mainstream today.''</p>
        <p>She reminded her audience of some items from the Republican record, hammering at the words and deeds of both Mr. Bush and his vice-presidential choice, Dick Cheney, and attacking their plans to keep the convention free of dissent. (Republican leaders, including Mr. Bush, have said they would not spend time criticizing Mrs. Clinton, a frequent target of some of the party's  voices.)</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton did not seem to feel the need to reciprocate.</p>
        <p>''We need leaders who won't just talk the talk of equal opportunity,'' she said, her voice noticeably hoarse from a week of intense campaigning for the United States Senate seat from New York. ''We need leaders who have, and are, and will walk the walk with all of us. We need to ask, 'What will you do when the cameras go away?'  And 'What did you do before the cameras arrived?' Because if you look at the record, there are a lot of people running for office this year who haven't always walked the walk or talked the talk.''</p>
        <p>She repeatedly referred to Mr. Cheney as Congressman Cheney and pointed to his voting record as a member of Congress in the 1980's. No less than three times in a 30-minute speech, she noted Mr. Cheney's 1986 vote against a resolution urging freedom for Nelson Mandela, who was then in a South African prison. She reminded the audience of Mr. Bush's visit to Bob Jones University, the South Carolina campus that at the time banned interracial dating. She told listeners that Mr. Bush had named Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas as model justices on the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>That remark went far with the crowd, which responded with a loud groan. Mrs. Clinton nodded, pausing for effect. ''We need to make sure everybody knows that,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''The strategy of the other side is to induce a case of political amnesia in every one of us,'' she added. ''Forget about those votes to keep Nelson Mandela in prison and to abolish Head Start. Forget about all that rhetoric. Forget about going to Bob Jones University. Just take us as we are and appear in these beautiful pictures that we send out every day.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney has defended his 1986 vote by saying that Mr. Mandela's group, the African National Congress, was then considered a terrorist organization. He has lately praised Mr. Mandela, who became president of South Africa after the dismantling of apartheid.</p>
        <p>After Mrs. Clinton's remarks, the New York Urban League president, Dennis Walcott, said Mrs. Clinton had struck many of the chords that most resonate with his group's members. The exception, he said, was restraint in addressing police violence.</p>
        <p>Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Lazio, he said, had spoken specifically on whether, for instance, they supported calls for federal oversight of the New York Police Department or a special prosecutor to handle police brutality complaints. Over the weekend, the Rev. Al Sharpton urged voters to suspend their support for either candidate until each had stated positions on the question of federal oversight.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has said nothing specific on federal oversight of the police. Although she has criticized the Giuliani administration for exacerbating tensions between the police and minority groups, she limited her comments yesterday: The police, she said, have a responsibility ''to protect and respect.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign aides have not responded to questions about his stand on federal oversight of the Police Department.</p>
        <p>On another topic, though, a campaign spokesman, Bryan Flood, said  Mrs. Clinton had failed to gain any traction when she invoked Mr. Lazio's ties to Mr. Gingrich in the past.  ''New Yorkers know the Lazio record and they know he's a mainstream candidate,'' Mr. Flood said. ''What you've seen over the last week with the Clinton campaign ratcheting up negative campaign tactics probably reflects some sense of panic over the fact that Mrs. Clinton is not connecting with New York voters.''</p>
        <p>In general, Mrs. Clinton said little about the New York race yesterday, referring to Mr. Lazio not by name, but as ''my opponent.'' Instead, she rattled off a list -- albeit one carefully selected for this crowd -- of the differences between what she called ''our side'' and ''their side,'' on education, gun control and health care.</p>
        <p>She took aim at the convention in particular, saying with sarcasm that she was certain it would be a display of racial and ethnic diversity. One of the convention's keynote speakers on opening night last night was Gen. Colin L. Powell, among the Republicans' most prominent black leaders.</p>
        <p>''They speak in these soothing tones about compassion and harmony and inclusion,'' she said. ''Governor Bush and Congressman Cheney want to present an appealing package and it is, I have to say, a brilliant marketing strategy. They don't want us to open that package. Inside, you know what we'll find? We'll find Republican policies well to the right of the Republican ticket of 1996.''</p>
