      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Bill Clinton was impeached, right? No one here at the Republican National Convention seems to recall.</p>
        <p>''It's forgotten,'' said Robert L. Livingston, the former congressman from Louisiana, who abandoned his dream of being speaker and resigned his seat in the tumult surrounding the impeachment. ''Whether the president was impeached or wasn't impeached really is a nonissue.''</p>
        <p>It sure seemed like a big deal at the time, what with all that talk about history and the Constitution and the rule of law. But a convention is no time to boast about a landmark legislative feat.</p>
        <p>''I think that what the key to this convention is and what the key to this election is, is that voters want to focus on issues,'' said Representative Bill McCollum, Republican of Florida. That sounded remarkably similar to what the president used to say back when he was being impeached so many years ago. Well, two years ago, anyway. O.K., a little less than that, even.</p>
        <p>Back in those days, Mr. McCollum used to say things like, ''his conduct constitutes a great insult to our constitutional system and subverts our system of government.''</p>
        <p>Nowadays, Mr. McCollum, who was one of the House members who prosecuted Mr. Clinton in the well of the Senate, is running to return to that chamber as a senator himself. But no one brings up impeachment on the campaign trail, he said. ''I don't see it coming up unless a media person asks me,'' he reported when asked.</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton, the man who suffered the incredible lightness of being impeached, was off in Florida today raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for Mr. McCollum's opponent, Bill Nelson. But Mr. McCollum demurred when offered the chance to say that the president had put him in his cross hairs for revenge. ''I don't know if he has or not,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In truth, impeachment is forgotten but not gone. When George W. Bush refers to restoring ''honor and dignity'' to the White House, everyone knows that he is talking about the internship program. Republican congressmen have used the issue in fund-raising appeals to gingerly chosen conservative donors. And when pressed about it, Republicans involved declare their pride in having done what they believed was right, at great political cost.</p>
        <p>So there is something poignant in all this silence -- as with the once-ballyhooed Contract with America at the last Republican convention, when Speaker Newt Gingrich (Remember him? He's around here somewhere) chose in his speech to emphasize beach volleyball instead.</p>
        <p>The closest the platform comes to using the I-word is this: ''And, at a time when the nation felt betrayed by misconduct in high office, the Republican Congress responded with gravity and high purpose. We applaud those members who did their duty to conscience and the Constitution.'' (Page 45.)</p>
        <p>For his part, the genial Mr. Livingston said he had moved on. He is attending the convention as a delegate from Louisiana, and he helped draw up the platform. He is working as a lobbyist in Washington and spending time with his family. He cannot vote, he said, but otherwise representing his clients is ''not so far apart from what I did as a congressman, in representing constituents.''</p>
        <p>He said he had no regrets about losing his job in a fight he believes the public no longer cares about.</p>
        <p>''The system worked,'' he said. ''I think he had to be impeached. I think the Senate wasn't ever going to convict him. And that's life. We all played our roles, and I played mine and moved on.''</p>
