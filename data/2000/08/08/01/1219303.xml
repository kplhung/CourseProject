        <p>INTERNATIONAL</p>
        <p>A3-9</p>
        <p>Israeli Leader Weathers A No-Confidence Vote  Prime Minister Ehud Barak survived a no-confidence vote in Parliament mounted by Ariel Sharon and other opponents of recent peace efforts. But it was far from a victory for Mr. Barak, who must put together a coalition from small parties.</p>

        <p>Shimon Peres, the Nobel laureate and three-time prime minister, lost his bid for the presidency to Moshe Katsav, a little-known Iranian-born lawmaker of the opposition Likud.</p>

        <p>German Official Speaks Out  Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, reacting to a wave of anti-immigrant violence, suggested that a silent majority might be abetting such crimes by not speaking out against them.</p>

        <p>Weapons and Diamonds  American and British officials accused the presidents of Liberia and Burkina Faso of taking a personal role in trading arms for diamonds despite a United Nations embargo and of aiding Sierra Leone rebels.</p>

        <p>No Mandate in Venezuela  President Hugo Chavez won an overwhelming personal victory in Sunday's election, winning 59 percent of the vote. But his coattails were apparently not long enough to pull into Congress the followers needed to guarantee him absolute powers. In National Assembly races, pro-Chavez parties won 99 of 165 seats, just short of a two-thirds majority.</p>

        <p>New Overture From Taiwan  President Chen Shui-bian issued another appeal to China to reopen negotiations with his government. But the overture, one of several since he was elected in March, was all but lost in the face of his deepening political troubles at home and evidence of mounting impatience in Beijing.</p>

        <p>Death Sentence for Corruption  China sentenced a former central government official to death for taking almost $5 million in bribes. The former official, Cheng Kejie, would be the most senior official executed for corruption since the Communists took control in 1949.</p>

        <p>G.O.P. Opens Convention On a Theme of Moderation  The Republican National Convention approved a platform intended both to reassure the party's conservative base and signal to the broader electorate that the party had been transformed by Gov. George W. Bush's bid for the center. Democrats and their allies quickly seized on the most conservative provisions, like the call for a ban on abortion, as evidence that little had changed.</p>

        <p>Colin L. Powell challenged delegates to rally behind Mr. Bush with a genuine commitment to minorities.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>The Bush team is giving the House campaign effort no prime-time exposure, although many Republicans worry more about losing the House than winning the presidency. Still, no one from the party's Congressional wing was publicly complaining.</p>
        <p>A15</p>
        <p>Philadelphia police officers backed off before an illegal protest parade, led by a phalanx of toddlers and infants backed up by paraplegics in wheelchairs, rather than face a potentially violent confrontation.</p>
        <p>A17</p>
        <p>President Clinton, fund-raising in Florida, assailed the Republicans and their party's platform.</p>
        <p>A19</p>
        <p>Report on Expedited Citizenship  A Justice Department report detailed numerous errors by the I.N.S. as it rushed to naturalize one million immigrants in 1995 and 1996, including inadequate background checks on 180,000 people granted citizenship, but it cleared the White House of accusations that it had manipulated the citizenship program to inflate voter rolls for the 1996 election.</p>

        <p>U.S. Inquiry Into Bias Claims  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is investigating complaints of discrimination against Asian and Asian-American employees at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said spokesmen for the laboratory and the University of California, which manages it.</p>

        <p>Fighting Western Wildfires  Firefighters continued to battle a 63,270-acre fire in the Sierra Nevada, 120 miles north of Los Angeles, with the blaze still only about 15 percent contained and dangerous dry lightning forecast. All told, about 45 fires are burning over nearly 500,000 acres in five states.</p>

        <p>Torricelli Abandons New Jersey Governor Race  Senator Robert G. Torricelli, left, abruptly quit his three-week-old bid for governor in 2001 after an array of prominent Democrats said they favored his rival, James C. McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge, who nearly defeated Governor Whitman in 1997.</p>

        <p>Making the Gingrich Connection  Hillary Rodham Clinton, speaking in Manhattan at the National Urban League's convention, caustically linked her opponent, Rick A. Lazio, to the reign of Newt Gingrich -- reviving a tactic she briefly used after Mr. Lazio entered the Senate race.</p>
        <p>B1</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio is keeping a low profile at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.</p>

        <p>Jailed Student Dies in Cell  Kenneth Gregorio, 23, a student at Monmouth University in New Jersey, hanged himself in his jail cell a few hours after he and a friend were charged with the possession and intended sale of 49,000 tablets of Ecstasy, the dance-club drug, officials said. Investigators and prosecutors suggested the suicide might have been prompted by fear of tough new penalties for Ecstasy offenses.</p>
