        <p>A renewed wave of anti-immigrant violence in Germany has prompted Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to suggest that a silent majority may be abetting the crimes by not speaking out against them.</p>
        <p>His statement, with its thinly veiled allusion to past German passivity before the rise of rightist violence, reflected growing concern in the government over an abrupt increase in such attacks in a country that has more than seven million foreigners but remains uneasy with the idea that it is a ''land of immigration.''</p>
        <p>A bombing in Dusseldorf on Thursday that wounded nine immigrants, six of them Jews, was followed by a number of attacks over the weekend. The worst occurred in the eastern town of Eisenach, where two African asylum-seekers were kicked, spat upon and pursued by a group of neo-Nazi skinheads shouting ''Sieg Heil!''</p>
        <p>The authorities on Saturday raided the home of a policeman in Potsdam,  near Berlin, after hate calls were traced to his number. Officials found firearms, ammunition and anti-immigrant propaganda similar to the cache recently discovered in the dismantling of a rightist youth movement south of Dresden.</p>
        <p>''The fact that hatred of foreigners probably lies behind the Dusseldorf attack should rouse us all,'' Mr. Fischer, a member of the environmentalist Green Party, said in the statement on Saturday. ''We have reached a point where the majority of the population that has been silent up to now can no longer remain silent.''</p>
        <p>Certainly Germany appears to face a quandary over its identity. With great fanfare, the government today handed over the first of a planned 20,000 ''green cards,'' papers allowing skilled foreigners to come here and work in computer jobs.</p>
        <p>It is the first time since Turkish ''guest workers'' were admitted in the 1960's that Germany has formally invited immigrants in this way, a tacit admission that it requires outside talent to remain competitive in a global economy.</p>
        <p>But even as the door to legal immigration is pried open a fraction, animosity toward foreigners seems to be rising. Heinz Fromm, the president of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, a domestic intelligence service, expressed outrage similar to Mr. Fischer's in a newspaper interview published on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''People are being injured and killed,'' he was quoted as saying. ''These groups keep blacklists, including the names of well-known actors who are identified as Jews. Yet the population does not seem to take all this too seriously. Society must intervene or this development will damage the whole country.''</p>
        <p>The response today from the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine was furious. It published an editorial saying, ''Placing the entire German population under suspicion is hardly the way to promote reason.''</p>
        <p>Many Germans with no sympathy for rightist violence are troubled by the large number of foreigners, particularly Turks, in the country and by suggestions that Germany must embrance multiculturalism. As a result, politicians have been generally hesitant to broach the questions raised this weekend by Mr. Fischer.</p>
        <p>Since the fall of the Berlin Wall a decade ago, rightist violence has become a fact of German life. It is rooted principally in the east, where, since the collapse of the Communist state there, youth unemployment has remained high, alienation widespread and broad exposure to foreigners a novelty.</p>
        <p>''There has been a virtually unbroken nationalist tradition in the east of the country for decades,'' said Klaus Klott, a teacher who worked for several years in the eastern town of Jena. ''Exposure to a multicultural society is something entirely new, and in many instances it is violently resented.''</p>
        <p>What seems clear from the recent attacks is that even a decade of German unity has not diminished this rightist and xenophobic sentiment. In the last decade, more than 100 people have been killed in Germany in xenophobic attacks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fromm suggested that the spread of Internet sites full of racist invective and the passivity of most Germans had in fact allowed the anti-immigrant groups to spread their message.</p>
        <p>''The perpetrators obviously think they will not face much resistance from the community,'' he said. ''They even have the feeling they are acting on behalf of the majority.''</p>
        <p>Officials close to Mr. Fischer suggested that the minister was troubled by what he views as the post-Nazi German taboo surrounding nationalist extremism and anti-Semitism. ''What is needed is more open debate,'' one official said. ''An unhealthy silence has descended.''</p>
        <p>The recent killing of a child by a pit bull prompted a far more vigorous national debate over dogs than anything that emerged from the killing on June 11 of an African immigrant, Alberto Adriano, by a group of neo-Nazi thugs in Dessau.</p>
        <p>This point was made on Sunday in an unusually emotional television debate that touched on the subject, in which Annette Kahane, the director of a foundation that seeks to combat racist violence, noted that no government minister appeared in Dessau after Mr. Adriano's death or issued a statement on his behalf.</p>
