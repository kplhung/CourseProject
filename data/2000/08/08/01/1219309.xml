        <p>Representatives Michael G. Oxley and Billy Tauzin have brought their cash-fueled competition for the chairmanship of the House Commerce Committee to the Republican convention. And corporations affected by the committee are betting on both men.</p>
        <p>At parties tonight and Tuesday financed by some of the companies the committee regulates, Mr. Oxley, of Ohio, and Mr. Tauzin, of Louisiana, will entertain lawmakers and lobbyists with rock 'n' roll and zydeco and stuff them with food.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oxley, who leads the Commerce Subcommittee on Finance and Hazardous Materials, and Mr. Tauzin, who presides over the telecommunications subcommittee, are in a race to see who can raise the most money this year. Since the beginning of last year, they have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars -- and given much of it away to win the allegiance of Republican House members. The Commerce Committee sits astride much of American industry, and its chairman is one of the most powerful figures on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>The confluence of corporate money, political influence and Congressional power is one of the hidden motifs of this and all modern political conventions. While the Congressional leaders in Washington are not being showcased during television prime time in Philadelphia, their Beltway battles and intrigues have followed them here.</p>
        <p>The Oxley-Tauzin contest provides the most striking example of the phenomenon here this week, but other lawmakers are also using the occasion to solicit special interest money, often from industries they oversee. Scott Harshbarger, president of Common Cause, a group that monitors campaign spending, said, ''People are giving who have clear business before these committees.''</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Oxley and Mr. Tauzin have amassed enormous war chests for their re-election campaigns this fall, and nearly all of the money comes from corporate political action committees and individuals with interests before the Commerce Committee, according to an analysis provided by the Center for Responsive Politics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tauzin has already raised $541,845 for his re-election bid, and his leadership political action committee, the Bayou Leadership PAC, has raised $49,234 since January 1999, Federal Election Commission data shows. Mr. Tauzin has given away more than $43,000 of his PAC's money to the election campaigns of his fellow House members. Mr. Oxley does not have a leadership PAC.</p>
        <p>The receptions here span the spectrum of corporate interests. Time Warner, Walt Disney, Universal Studios and Viacom are giving a party for Representative Mark Foley of Florida, chairman of the House Entertainment Industry Task Force. It is one of the hottest tickets this week, to be held on Wednesday at 10 p.m. at the Shampoo Night Club.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T bought martinis and cigars, and Guinness provided the stout for Representative David Dreier of California, chairman of the House Rules Committee at the Continental, a 50's-style diner jammed with so many cigar-smoking lobbyists that 100 people who wanted to could not get in. Limousines and town cars were double-parked outside on Market Street.</p>
        <p>The Oxley and Tauzin receptions, expected to cost as much as $500,000 each, are sponsored by companies with business before the Commerce Committee. Mr. Oxley's party, on the old soundstage of ''American Bandstand,'' was sponsored tonight by 18 investment houses, insurance companies, accounting firms and chemical industry associations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tauzin's Mardi Gras event, to be held on Tuesday night, is underwritten by ''a bunch of telecommunications and energy companies,'' an aide to Mr. Tauzin said today. The aide would not name them.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrylser put on a dual-purpose party, displaying its latest models and paying tribute to Representative J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican Conference. Mr. Watts joined the Temptations on the stage of the downtown Convention Center for a rendition of ''My Girl.''</p>
