        <p>Their heads shook at the memories, and the curses were interspersed with rueful laughter. David Meggett fumbled three punts in the first preseason game of his career and let another one bounce into him before the opposing team recovered it.</p>
        <p>''I have tried a thousand times to forget that game,'' said Meggett, who quit football last year as the National Football League's leading career punt returner.</p>
        <p>Meggett arrived at Jets camp today to begin a two-day tutorial in the finer points of one of those most thankless -- but electrifying -- tasks in football. Coach Al Groh called Meggett last week and asked the former Giant, Patriot and Jet -- who will be a graduate assistant coach at Towson State in the fall -- to come to camp to offer advice.</p>
        <p>''Of all that happens in a game and all the knowledge coaches bring to a game, very few coaches in the league have returned punts,'' Groh said. ''It's an acquired skill. Besides the natural ability, there is some on-the-job training that goes with it.''</p>
        <p>The urgency for Meggett's pointers grew at Saturday's preseason victory over the Saints. Nobody needs his words of wisdom more than Windrell Hayes, the Jets' experiment at punt returner. Hayes, whose University of Southern California biography shows no experience returning punts, skittishly fielded his first punt and was walloped after only gaining 1 yard. He returned the next one for 5 yards. And then the bottom fell out. In the third quarter, he botched the catch and the Saints recovered the ball on the Jets' 22-yard line. One play later, they scored a touchdown to narrow the Jets' lead to 14-13. Hayes looked at the next punt as if it were an alien spaceship hurtling toward him and did not even try to catch it.</p>
        <p>''Things like that happen,'' said Meggett, who also did not return punts in college. ''You don't have to talk to players about mistakes.''</p>
        <p>Meggett was at Saturday night's game, but did no coaching on the sideline. He has not talked to Hayes, and Hayes made it clear today that he did not want to talk about it either when he dodged requests for interviews. Today, Meggett had a classroom of about eight players -- including Wayne Chrebet -- and like a professor teaching a freshman year English literature survey, he began at the beginning.</p>
        <p>''My game plan is the fundamentals that were taught to me,'' Meggett said. ''Ball possession is No. 1. Sprinting to the ball, setting your feet and securing the catch. If you're in good position, there's small room for making mistakes. The only way you can get confidence is repetitions.''</p>
        <p>Groh is committed to Hayes. The Jets could go back to using Dedric Ward but they are clearly hoping that Hayes's reputation for good hands will rescue them. Ward averaged only 7.6 yards on 38 chances last season and, as a team, the Jets were next to last in the American Football Conference with an average of 7.4 yards a return.</p>
        <p>Groh spoke only briefly to Hayes Saturday night -- ''I said, 'Pick it up,' '' Groh said -- and does not seem concerned that Hayes's punt-return problems may make him so nervous that his receiving skills suffer, too, although Hayes caught only 2 passes for 12 yards Saturday. Groh was an assistant coach with the Giants when Meggett came into the league and he has inherited Bill Parcells's tough-love approach. Parcells insisted that Meggett stay with punt returns despite his problems. Meggett remembers the experience differently.</p>
        <p>''My dude left me in the oven,'' Meggett said.</p>
        <p>Meggett has already had one success as a professor, and he may not even know it. Aaron Glenn, who dropped three punts in his preseason debut, credits watching film of Meggett -- whose style was to make a basket with his chest and bent arms -- with helping him overcome his miserable start. Glenn expects to return kickoffs this season.</p>
        <p>''When I started, I tried to catch with my hands,'' Glenn said. ''Now I've gotten better at it. I've started basket catching. It made it much easier.''</p>
        <p>Hayes should be taking notes.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The ax fell swiftly on the second-year running back ROBERT FARMER, who fumbled two handoffs Saturday night and was waived Monday. . . . The rookie defensive end SHAUN ELLIS was briefly ejected from the morning practice after getting into a fight with KEVIN MAWAE. Ellis was in a skirmish during minicamp and was told then that if he did it again, he would be banished. He will also be fined. . . . Right defensive end ERIC OGBOGU (shoulder) returned to practice with a flourish, getting into morning and afternoon fights. . . . Nickel back RAY MICKENS (hamstring) returned, but running back BERNIE PARMALEE (sore foot), defensive linemen JASON WILTZ (elbow) and RICHARD SEALS (elbow) missed practice. . . . Cornerback OTIS SMITH, who is struggling to keep his job while commanding $1.2 million, will probably have to play special teams -- which he has not done in several years -- to make the team. Smith is the fifth cornerback, behind the starters AARON GLENN and MARCUS COLEMAN, Mickens and TONY SCOTT.</p>
