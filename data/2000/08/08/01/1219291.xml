        <p>The Republican National Convention today approved a platform intended to both reassure the party's conservative base and signal to the broader electorate that the party had been transformed by Gov. George W. Bush's bid for the center.</p>
        <p>Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the platform committee, hailed the document's ''positive, uplifting'' tone and described it to the delegates as a platform that ''every Republican can be proud of, and one that will carry George Bush to the White House.''</p>
        <p>But the effort to satisfy moderate and conservative constituencies alike, and help ensure a peaceful convention, carried political risks of its own. Democrats and their allies quickly seized on the most conservative parts of the platform, like its call for a ban on abortion, as evidence that little had changed in the Republican Party beyond rhetoric and imagery.</p>
        <p>''We're going to use the platform like we're going to use George Bush's record in Texas and Dick Cheney's voting record -- to show the American people that this is still the same old Republican Party,'' said Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>The document approved today had been carefully managed by Mr. Bush's allies, and much of it bears his unmistakable mark. It incorporates his policy proposals, and his language, on a set of issues at the heart of his campaign, from education to tax cuts, from health care to immigration. In keeping with his  theme of ''compassionate conservatism,'' it declares that ''for every American, there must be a ladder of opportunity, and for those most in need, a safety net of care.''</p>
        <p>Governor Thompson and other Bush allies worked hard over weeks of private and public meetings to ensure that the platform process was free of the divisiveness of prior years and did not distract from the upbeat message of the convention and the campaign.</p>
        <p>They chose to fight conservatives on some issues -- notably the governor's education plan -- that they felt were imperative to underscore the idea that Mr. Bush was ''a different kind of Republican.'' But they removed the abortion issue from contention early on, declaring that they did not want the plank to change, even though Mr. Bush says his personal position is less restrictive.</p>
        <p>The only suspense today was whether Republicans who support abortion rights would win enough support among delegates either for a minority report or to bring the issue to the floor. They did not, although they insisted they had come close  despite heavy opposition from the party establishment. They vowed to return to the grass roots re-energized, and promised a stronger fight on the issue four years from now.</p>
        <p>As a result, all was harmony when the platform was presented to the convention this afternoon, and quickly approved on a voice vote. Abortion was never mentioned from the podium, although many delegates were wearing vests, handed out by the Republican National Coalition for Life, that bore anti-abortion slogans.  In the only allusion to the division on social issues that at times had roiled the platform committee's deliberations, Mr. Thompson declared, ''As Republicans, there is so much more that unites us than divides us.''</p>
        <p>As passed, the platform embraces Mr. Bush's call for ''bold reforms in education,'' including a strong federal role in more accountability and more school choice; for ''saving and strengthening Social Security'' by allowing some private investment of payroll taxes; for an array of tax cuts; and for a more inclusive tone on immigration. In sharp contrast to the platform of 1996, it does not call for the abolition of a single federal agency, and the partisan attacks are markedly diminished.</p>
        <p>But for all the repositioning, the platform also reiterates most of the agenda of the party's social conservatives. It calls for a constitutional ban on abortion, without exceptions, and the appointment of judges who ''respect the sanctity of innocent human life.'' The only change in the plank is a new denunciation of the recent Supreme Court decision overturning state laws that banned the procedure opponents call ''partial birth'' abortion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has noted that he would personally allow abortion in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of a pregnant woman, and also says he does not support a litmus test for judicial appointments. But abortion rights groups say that by agreeing to the platform he in fact embraced a litmus test, and that this is a crucial indication of how he would make appointments to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''We will trumpet that message across the country,'' said Alice Germond, acting president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. ''On this issue, he's neither compassionate nor kind.''</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, allowed himself some distance from the platform, particularly when responding to Democratic attacks.</p>
        <p>''We're very pleased that the platform has departed substantially from earlier platforms, notably in the areas of education and immigration,'' he said, but added, ''Governor Bush is going to run on his record and his views, and it's on that ground that he'll make his stand.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush differs as well with the platform's position on gays in the military; he supports the current ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy, while the platform declares that homosexuality is ''incompatible'' with military service. The platform also opposes counseling on contraceptives in school-based clinics, any recognition of ''special legal protection'' for homosexuals and any movement to recognize same-sex marriages.</p>
        <p>The document that emerged was generally praised by delegates, who were strikingly optimistic on this first convention day. Moments after the platform's passage, as the strains of ''Old Time Rock &amp; Roll'' filled the hall, Cathie Adams, president of the conservative Texas Eagle Forum, declared herself ''very happy'' with it. ''I think we're going to win,'' she said. ''And I'm going to work hard to make sure we do.''</p>
        <p>Former Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, now a lobbyist, described it as ''solidly right of center, a good, solid, reasonable platform that George W. Bush as nominee won't have to run away from.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Backus, of the Democratic National Committee, asserted that the platform was a mother lode of out-of-the-mainstream positions, not only on abortion but also on the environment, school vouchers and Medicare. ''This is about stripping away fluffy rhetoric and pretty photo ops,'' she said. ''People want to know what a party stands for and what a candidate stands for, and that's where the platform is important.''</p>
