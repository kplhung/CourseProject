        <p>Jomo Cousins remembers where he was when football season began a year ago.</p>
        <p>''Selling trailer homes in Casa Grande, Ariz.,'' Cousins, now a Giants defensive end, said today. ''It wasn't a bad gig, I sold my quota. But the truth part hurt me. I couldn't tell people bold-faced lies. Some of those guys in that business are pretty slimy. I couldn't keep up on the slime level.''</p>
        <p>Not long after, Cousins decided to try to resume his football career, and the Giants, looking for help at defensive end, signed the unheralded Cousins as a free agent in January. Eight months later, Cousins will start the Giants' first preseason game Saturday night against the Chicago Bears at Giants Stadium. He will replace the Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Strahan, out with a back injury.</p>
        <p>''I never thought I'd get to this point,'' Cousins said. ''But I didn't want to be a bust as a football player. I don't know, maybe people don't expect much out of a guy taken in the seventh round. But I do.''</p>
        <p>Cousins, who played two years of football at Florida A&amp;M, was the seventh draft choice of the Arizona Cardinals in 1998. By his own admission, Cousins, who is 6 feet 5 inches and 285 pounds, was raw coming out of college. Quick and athletic, he had potential as a pass rusher, but he lacked technique and experience. Originally a basketball player at Florida A&amp;M, he switched to football, but knee surgery limited his playing time.</p>
        <p>In 1998 with the Cardinals, Cousins was released at the end of preseason, then re-signed to the practice squad. He played in the N.F.L.'s Europe league in the spring of 1999 but hurt his shoulder and spent the rest of the year out of football, waiting for an injury grievance he had filed with Arizona to be settled.</p>
        <p>''I was sitting around the house, which I like to do,'' Cousins said. ''And my wife said, 'Why don't you get out of here and go do something.' I had recently gotten my real estate license because I believe in always trying to get more education. So a friend told me about the trailer homes, and I found myself 25 minutes outside Phoenix selling them. It was long, long hours. And after you see an average paycheck, you don't like it so much.''</p>
        <p>With the Giants, it's still evident that he is not a polished defensive end. But with Strahan missing the last week of practice, Cousins has been getting a lot of work with the first-string defense. His height and quick feet sometimes make him hard to block on an outside speed rush. But he is less skilled in the nuances of power-rushing styles.</p>
        <p>Even so, Cousins's coaches see improvement. And while the Giants say Strahan's injury is not serious, Cousins has a good chance to become the team's third defensive end, especially if the second-round draft pick Cornelius Griffin assumes a regular spot in the rotation at defensive tackle.</p>
        <p>Cousins, who said he was named after Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's founding president, understands he has made a rapid one-year ascent -- from salesman to preseason starter.</p>
        <p>''Last fall, I was selling trailer homes in a dirt town,'' he said. ''Maybe this seems like a lot at once. But I had something to prove. It wasn't about money, I had made some investments. I told my wife, 'I don't need to do this. I just wanted to prove to myself that I could.' ''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>During the final 30 minutes of their second practice Wednesday, linebacker MIKE BARROW, safety SAM GARNES and wide receiver IKE HILLIARD collided diving for a pass in the right corner of the end zone. Barrow stayed down briefly and came up limping. Garnes got up, but went to the sideline where his neck was examined by team doctors. Hilliard was not hurt. ''Barrow is all right,'' Giants Coach JIM FASSEL said. ''He tweaked his knee at little. Garnes got hit in the throat, but everything is fine. He's just sore.'' Garnes was sent to a nearby hospital as a precautionary measure and released. . . . Fassel said MICHAEL STRAHAN, who missed his fifth consecutive practice because of back stiffness, is expected to practice Monday. . . . Defensive tackle KEITH HAMILTON, who has a hamstring strain, won't play in Saturday's game.</p>
