        <p>If you thought that the surface of every public space -- including stadium walls, shopping carts and airplane seats -- had already been appropriated for advertising, you were mistaken.

        <p>If you thought that the surface of every public space -- including stadium walls, shopping carts and airplane seats -- had already been appropriated for advertising, you were mistaken. A company called AutoWraps has found yet another canvas that until recently was untouched by commercialization: your car.</p>
        <p>More than 30,000 people have signed up for the privilege of having their cars used as rolling advertisements, according to Daniel Shifrin, president of the company. Those who are selected receive payments of $100 to $400 a month, depending on how much of the car is covered.</p>
        <p>The cars are wrapped in a vinyl adhesive that is guaranteed not to damage the paint when removed. Many of the cars are also equipped with a Global Positioning System unit that tracks speed limits and driving patterns. Applicants must fill out a three-page registration form on the Web, at www.autowraps.com.</p>
        <p>Advertisers use a password-protected section of the site to find the cars they want to wrap, searching on specifics like the age of the drivers, where they work and which highways they travel.</p>
        <p>''It is commercialization of just about every free space that there is,'' said Mary Houser, director of communications for Scenic America, a lobbying group that fights what it calls billboard blight. ''There are some people who don't like living in one huge advertisement.''</p>
