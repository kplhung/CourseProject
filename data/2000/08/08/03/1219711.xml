        <p>Editorial urges Gov George W Bush, in speech to Republican Convention accepting presidential nomination, to go beyond broad themes and offer some details about specific policies and programs</p>

        <p>When Gov. George W. Bush addresses the Republican Convention tonight, in the most important speech of his career, he will face an oddly difficult challenge of his own making. For four days Philadelphia has echoed with uplifting talk about diversity, inclusion, family values and ''compassion.'' Last night the vice-presidential nominee, Richard B. Cheney, added a strong dose of partisan combativeness by turning Vice President Al Gore's 1992 attack line -- ''It's time for them to go'' -- back on the Democrats. But what is still missing is any discussion of the specific policies and programs that Mr. Bush intends to present to the country. Even Republican policies that the delegates hold dear --  tax cuts, distrust of government, privatizing Social Security -- have scarcely received mention from the podium. Mr. Bush's task tonight is to go beyond broad themes and begin to add some substance to this campaign.</p>
        <p>To be sure, passionate generalities about leaving no child behind and restoring American military strength are part of an honorable tradition of political oratory, and it is heartening to hear a leading Republican emphasize government that cares. But after four days, one has a right to expect something more nutritious. One of the few speakers to make a clear policy point in Philadelphia this week was Gen. Colin Powell, who supported affirmative action for minorities -- a policy the platform rejects. Republican opposition to abortion, gun control, campaign finance reform and the rights of patients to sue health maintenance organizations are core items on the party's agenda. They have hardly been mentioned from the podium in Philadelphia.</p>

        <p>When Gov. George W. Bush addresses the Republican Convention tonight, in the most important speech of his career, he will face an oddly difficult challenge of his own making. For four days Philadelphia has echoed with uplifting talk about diversity, inclusion, family values and ''compassion.'' Last night the vice-presidential nominee, Richard B. Cheney, added a strong dose of partisan combativeness by turning Vice President Al Gore's 1992 attack line -- ''It's time for them to go'' -- back on the Democrats. But what is still missing is any discussion of the specific policies and programs that Mr. Bush intends to present to the country. Even Republican policies that the delegates hold dear --  tax cuts, distrust of government, privatizing Social Security -- have scarcely received mention from the podium. Mr. Bush's task tonight is to go beyond broad themes and begin to add some substance to this campaign.</p>
        <p>To be sure, passionate generalities about leaving no child behind and restoring American military strength are part of an honorable tradition of political oratory, and it is heartening to hear a leading Republican emphasize government that cares. But after four days, one has a right to expect something more nutritious. One of the few speakers to make a clear policy point in Philadelphia this week was Gen. Colin Powell, who supported affirmative action for minorities -- a policy the platform rejects. Republican opposition to abortion, gun control, campaign finance reform and the rights of patients to sue health maintenance organizations are core items on the party's agenda. They have hardly been mentioned from the podium in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>In shunting aside the party's traditional wedge issues in favor of pleasing banalities, Governor Bush's political strategists are no doubt confident in their political judgment. Even the seasoned movement conservatives who support Mr. Bush are withholding their criticism, apparently certain that hiding their positions in a fog of generalities is the right way to go this year.</p>
        <p>But it should give Republicans some pause that the convention's television ratings have slipped sharply, perhaps because viewers have not encountered much in the way of ideas and policies. Mr. Cheney, for his part, did raise the energy level by showing how the Bush-Cheney ticket will use the attack-by-comparison to tie Mr. Gore to President Clinton and attempt to discredit both. Wheeling out what will probably be key words of the fall campaign, Mr. Cheney called Mr. Bush ''a man of principle, a man of honor'' who will ''restore decency and integrity to the Oval Office.'' He also placed the lightly experienced Texas governor in a G.O.P. leadership pantheon of Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.</p>
        <p>The Cheney performance cut against Mr. Bush's assertions that he does not like attack politics, although he is likely to salt his own speech tonight with language designed to remind voters of the Clinton administration's ethical problems. But it is also time for Mr. Bush to begin leveling with Americans on what he plans to do. He could start by laying out exactly why the economy needs the proposed 10-year, $1.9 trillion tax cut that would start in 2002 and eat up the federal surplus. It may sound odd to say it, but the time has come for Republicans to stand up for what they believe.</p>
