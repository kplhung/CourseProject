        <p>To a Bayreuth Festival torn between tradition and the call of modern times comes Jurgen Flimm's new production of the ''Ring des Nibelungen.'' Mr. Flimm, known to Germans as a theater, not an opera, director, brings to Wagner's weeklong tetralogy a kind of low-key iconoclasm. If the temple is not torn down, it is at least redecorated.</p>
        <p>A new ''Ring'' arrives every four years or so at the summer shrine built by the great man and dedicated to himself. The first cycle began last week and continued into this one, ending last night with ''Gotterdammerung.'' In place was the true Wagner audience: reverently quiet, fiercely opinionated and at some distance from the relatively clamorous crowd at the opening night's ''Parsifal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Flimm and his set designer, Erich Wonder, give us a contemporary landscape and fiddle extensively with the minutiae of  Wagner's stage directions. Valhalla is a high rise in the making, a construction site framed by concrete slabs. Wotan and Alberich are businessmen competing for hegemony. The descent into the caves of Nibelheim ends in a contamination-free microchip factory.</p>
        <p>Loge, brightly done by Kim Begley, is a lawyer type with a briefcase and a creamy three-piece suit. The Valkyries appear as a squadron of airborne commandos in combat fatigues. The hall of the Gibichungs is modular glass and stainless steel. Critics here have sniped at Mr. Flimm's alleged lifting of details from previous radically updated ''Ring'' 's, but they may be missing the point.</p>
        <p>Indeed, neither the pros and cons of 21st-century capitalism nor the Freudianisms of dysfunctional family life seem to be much on the director's mind. Past competitors have used the mythic barbarism of the ''Ring'' to project a worldview of current events. Mr. Flimm, on the other hand, is just trying to tell a good story and thinks that recognizable props will do it better. The modern world is helpful to the narrative but not the subject of a tract.</p>
        <p>As soon as the metaphor ceases to tell the story, Mr. Flimm abandons it. Wotan's spear is an accessory to his gray business suit and lies across the architect's drawing board in ''Das Rheingold.'' There are real giants (albeit got up like American Indians); real swords, not tommy guns; real shields instead of bulletproof vests. Are the Rhinemaidens waterfront hookers or bathing beauties in one-piece suits from Bayreuth's local H&amp;M? I don't think we are being asked to decide.</p>
        <p>Fafner in dragon form is a curiously writhing rock formation. Elsewhere, Mr. Wonder has built walls as arcs that rotate and enclose. Brunnhilde's resting place is a tall cylinder, the Magic Fire a red band that encircles it.</p>
        <p>Most people seemed delighted by the simplicity and originality of ''Das Rheingold'' and ''Die Walkure,'' but Mr. Flimm ran into trouble at Saturday's ''Siegfried,'' and his stock continued to decline, bottoming out with the wave of boos at the end of ''Gotterdammerung.''</p>
        <p>''Siegfried'' dragged, but then almost any interpretation of it does. And by the time this third ''Ring'' opera arrived, Mr. Wonder's visual coups had lost any power to amaze. The singing was more damaging. Such is the labor shortage for ''Ring'' productions that intendants seek out not the ideal talent but the least objectionable. Bayreuth is at least fortunate in its Wotan; Alan Titus gathered command and confidence with every appearance.</p>
        <p>Placido Domingo and Waltraud Meier played Siegmund and Sieglinde, one bringing luxurious delivery to Act I of ''Die Walkure,'' the other white heat. Ms. Meier, who blasted the festival's competence in a farewell press interview, contributed her customary hair-raising intensity to the stage. Mr. Domingo's nicety of articulation and beauty of sound may not be Wagnerian, but they have much to teach any Wagner tenor.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Gabriele Schnaut is battle-scarred by a few too many Brunnhildes. She was ferociously loud, and her wobble so favored its upper extreme that the impression was of persistent sharpness. Ms. Schnaut's Brunnhilde bore down on the helpless listener like a sopranic freight train threatening derailment at any moment.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schnaut was at least in better control of her assets than her counterpart, Wolfgang Schmidt. The people who hired Mr. Schmidt surely knew his shortcomings, but I don't think they deserved his near-collapse at the end of ''Siegfried.''</p>
        <p>In ''Gotterdammerung'' he became merely coarse, a distinct improvement. When Mr. Schmidt sang quietly, one heard remnants of a once-attractive tenor voice. But Wagner is a notorious destroyer of techniques. In moments of pressure this Siegfried could offer only strangled desperation. When we were lucky, Mr. Schmidt landed on no pitch at all, creating a kind of 19th-century German Romantic rap.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flimm, to his credit and our relief, had coached both singers into theatrical believability, but their performances did not repay him well. Yet rest assured that neither singer has squandered further chances for employment. Wagner roles constitute a seller's market, and casting them is the art of the possible.</p>
        <p>The production had better luck elsewhere, especially in Gunter von Kannen, a marvelously blowsy and disreputable Alberich, and in John Tomlinson's Hagen, which did much to rescue ''Gotterdammerung.'' Birgit Remmert in the tailored suits of a soccer mom created a Fricka of dignity and poise. Mette Ejsing as Erda boomed attractively. Violeta Urmana, so effective as Kundry in ''Parsifal,'' was a finely passionate Waltraute in ''Gotterdammerung.'' Others (Philip Kang as Fafner, Michael Howard as Mime) were certainly acceptable.</p>
        <p>Giuseppe Sinopoli seemed a strange choice to conduct the ''Ring.'' The Bayreuth acoustical aesthetic (clear, resonant vocal sound in a largely wooden enclosure; warm, almost muffled orchestra sound emanating from a covered pit) does not exactly play into this conductor's hands. Mr. Sinopoli is small, thin and nervous, and his music-making sounds much the same. I admired some of the nearly out-of-control passions surrounding Siegfried's death and also forgave a lot of ragged ensemble work and vague accompaniments.</p>
        <p>Maybe Mr. Sinopoli's prominent winds and brass and his noticeably reticent string sound (more expansive in ''Gotterdammerung'') were the proper companions for Mr. Flimm's high-tech production. Mr. Sinopoli sustained a lot of booing after ''Siegfried,'' appeared for only one curtain call and did not appear at Saturday's news conference.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flimm's production seems caught in the center of a long-running war over Wagner style, and this is one instance where the middle of the road guarantees no safety. Radical revisionists want his ''Ring'' to dare and provoke more than it does. Others, like the American millionaire and patron I overheard at intermission, consider Mr. Flimm ''eccentric.''</p>
        <p>This production also appears in the midst of yet another power struggle for control of Bayreuth. Blustery and combative at 80, Wolfgang Wagner, the composer's grandson, holds on. But his attackers this year are not only family members, but also distinguished Bayreuthians like the bass Hans Sotin, who withdrew from ''Parsifal,'' and Ms. Meier, who has made no bones about her disgust with current policy. Mr. Wagner has been bolstered by a large sum of American money to produce a new ''Tannhauser'' two years from now.</p>
        <p>It is in such turmoil that Mr. Flimm has had to operate. Some of the operas, ''Siegfried'' especially, need work, but once the clamor for spectacle has died down and a more acceptable Brunnhilde and Siegfried have been found, Wagnerites might find that this is a ''Ring'' that tells its story rather well.</p>
