        <p>The second cutting of hay has been postponed in the Berkshires because the farmers can't get into the fields. If August goes on the way July has, the horses will have to eat hostas, which have never looked more prosperous. Everything fungal is also having a high time of it. On yet another wet morning, with the rain disguised temporarily as fog, the bees hung in sodden mats from the hive entrances. The sky has been the color of auto primer all week long. The old metaphors for night's arrival fail. It does not ''come,'' it does not ''fall.'' The sun does not ''set.'' The clouds merely obtrude themselves until darkness is complete. The dogs, who are photosensitive for food, expect 5 o'clock supper at noon.</p>
        <p>And so July ended. It has been like living under a rhubarb leaf. In parts of the Northeast, the month's average rainfall fell in a single day, disbelief rising like water in the storm drains as hour after hour passed with no letup, the runoff gouging out driveways and washing out fields, stunting already stunted corn. The average daily temperature for July was colder than normal by nearly 4 1/2 degrees in New York City, or colder by nearly 8 1/2 degrees than last July, when we were all complaining about the insufferable heat. It goes to show how finely attuned to normal the human organism really is, what keen thermostats we keep within us. At the same time, it makes normal seem like an unapproachable ideal, a figment of the statistician's imagination.</p>

        <p>At a certain point, no matter how long it rains, you just have to give up and go with it. I weed in the rain and pick blackberries and blueberries in the rain. I have seen people mowing in the rain, wearing bright yellow slickers and moving quickly to keep the blades from jamming with wet grass. I harvested the garlic in the garden not long ago and then found myself wondering where I could possibly hang it to dry. Walking up the sunken road that runs past our house, I came upon a great blue heron airing its feet on the gravel crown. A red-tailed hawk hung mewing in the current high overhead, just to feel the breeze.</p>
        <p>What is particularly disconcerting is knowing that, above the hawk and above the cloud cover, the sun is shining brightly, tipping now toward evening and Scorpio's rise. I think of a kind of photomachy going on up there, a struggle between light and dark, the sun trying to pierce the clouds while the clouds, infinitely mutable, block the sun's energies. It is something Rubens would paint, a masterpiece of effulgence and protuberance, a Baroque battle scene in whose shadow the ordinary lives of ordinary people go steadily on, while they wait to see how it will all turn out.</p>
