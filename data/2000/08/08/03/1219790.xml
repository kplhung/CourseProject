        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Forty years ago, when I opened my firm for the express purpose of building traditional pipe organs, crystal ball gazers were sure that I was bound to fail because electronic organs were going to replace pipe organs. They have replaced inferior pipe organs, to be sure. They also have redefined our craft and directed pipe organ builders worldwide to create superb wind-blown musical instruments: pipe organs. The firms in the Associated Pipe Organ Builders of America and their colleagues in the International Society of Organ Builders -- most of them makers of pipe organs -- do not endorse so-called hybrid instruments. They simply believe that uncompromisingly beautiful musical instruments have an important place in today's world.  There are enough discerning clients to keep them very busy; their average backlog for new organs is about two years.</p>

        <p>As long as musicians of the New York Philharmonic use real (and expensive) violins, discriminating musicians and churches equating excellence with their religious beliefs will create a strong demand for wind-blown, excellent pipe organs.  FRITZ NOACK  Georgetown, Mass.</p>
