        <p>''6,000 Years of Housing'' was first published in 1981, but a new edition, published last month, has added the 20th century to the discussions of ancient huts and yurts. The book, by Norbert Schoenauer, an emeritus professor of architecture at McGill University, notes that many primitive cultures built dome-shaped structures of leaves, bark, mats or skins. ''There are no vertical walls, windows or smoke holes, but only an entranceway without a door,'' he said. For today's cities, he urges a mixture of single-family homes, high-rise apartments and buildings sized in between. (W. W. Norton, $50.)</p>
