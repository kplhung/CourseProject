        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The economic rationale for the addition of electronic components to organs is most compelling. Electronic components are a fraction of the cost of the compressors, connectors, values and pipes that can run the cost of traditional pneumatic instruments into six figures. Proponents of electronics argue that digital sampling technology makes sounds indistinguishable from the sounds made by wind blowing into pipes. Traditionalists insist that the rich tones and harmonics created by pipes playing together cannot be reproduced electronically.</p>

        <p>The economic rationale for the addition of electronic components to organs is most compelling. Electronic components are a fraction of the cost of the compressors, connectors, values and pipes that can run the cost of traditional pneumatic instruments into six figures. Proponents of electronics argue that digital sampling technology makes sounds indistinguishable from the sounds made by wind blowing into pipes. Traditionalists insist that the rich tones and harmonics created by pipes playing together cannot be reproduced electronically.</p>
        <p>But there is another issue. A half-century ago, a renaissance in pipe organs began in this country. The purpose has been to accurately recreate the music of classical composers, most famously Bach. Ancient Baroque instruments were brought from Europe and restored, and new organs were built and installed with 17th-century designs and materials. Music deriving from the Baroque still comprises a large part of organ music played in concerts and churches. Organists and audiences take great pride in these American renaissance organs, with air as the only medium, as authentic to the classical repertory.</p>
