        <p>W. E. Moore started one of the earliest public transportation lines in Britain in 1815, with three donkeys and a cart. The company first delivered packages in an area centered around the English town of Colchester and started carrying people around 1865. Horse-drawn passenger service started in 1881, and a Clarkson steam passenger bus began running in 1914. The company lasted more than 150 years and was eventually purchased in 1963.</p>
        <p>The history of the Moore Brothers company and of several other fleets is online at the British Bus Archives (www.britishbus.co.uk  /index.html), with pictures of motorized coaches, double-decker buses and trams, articles by bus fans and links to more than a dozen museums.</p>
