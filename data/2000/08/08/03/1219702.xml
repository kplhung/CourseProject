        <p>When Relativity Technologies began a search this spring for a new president, its equity was in great demand. Even before negotiating with job candidates, it had to deal with the demand for a stake from the executive search firms.</p>
        <p>Well aware that competition for top talent is fierce, Vivek Wadhwa, the company's chief executive, planned to hire one of the top firms. When he contacted two of them, Heidrick &amp; Struggles International and Christian &amp; Timbers, he was surprised to find that they wanted more than just a six-figure cash fee. Each asked for a sizable equity position in his company, a software developer based in Cary, N.C., that eventually plans to go public.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wadwha considered the price, nearly half a million dollars, too high and refused. Instead, he chose Kathy Forbes, who runs a small recruiting business in Atlanta. ''It's become insane,'' he said. Companies like his are no longer selecting search firms, he says, so much as the firms are picking them.</p>
        <p>Giving away an equity stake began as a way for companies without much cash to compensate lawyers, consultants and recruiting firms. But deluged with work in a tight labor market, executive recruiters increasingly demand -- and get -- equity as a condition of performing a top-level search for many private companies aiming to go public or others whose stock seems particularly appealing.</p>
        <p>''We've created this mantra: you want to work with us, we have to get equity,'' said Ted Martin, the founder of his own recruiting firm in Chicago. In choosing an assignment, recruiters now routinely consider how well a client's stock might do, especially given the recent market swings. ''With all these new technology companies, everybody wants to be in because you want the home run,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Few executives seem to have taken Mr. Wadhwa's stance, refusing to hand over a significant share of their company, but others have bristled at the arrangement. ''You are going to run into clients who think you're smoking weed,'' Mr. Martin admitted.</p>
        <p>Recruiters are well positioned to get what they want. Venture capitalists and other investors are flooding start-ups with capital, allowing companies to throw around large sums to pay somebody to help run the business. Top recruiters have typically demanded the equivalent of a third of the executive's first-year pay package. With the booming stock market, those packages have increasingly included a hefty portion of stock options or warrants, and recruiters have begun in the last year or two to ask for a third of that equity as well.</p>
        <p>''These search firms are incredibly busy,'' said Charles Johnson, a venture capitalist with Noro-Moseley Partners in Atlanta, who generally recommends that the companies his firm has backed pay the prevailing rate. An investor in Relativity, Mr. Johnson suggested Heidrick for that search.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wadhwa, though, was surprised by the overheated environment for his company's first major search. No neophyte, he had helped found another company, Seer Technologies, in 1990 before leaving in 1997 to found Relativity and had spent more than 25 years in the technology industry.</p>
        <p>Although the position of president had been open for more than a year, after Matthew Szulik left in 1998 to become the president of Red Hat, Mr. Wadhwa had been in no rush to fill it. As Relativity began contemplating an initial public offering of stock, Mr. Wadhwa felt the need for someone to help run the company.  ''What I needed was a good operations executive,'' he said. ''I hate details.''</p>
        <p>He initially turned to his board for some names, but soon decided to approach an executive recruiter to find a president and chief operating officer. He had met Jeff Christian of Christian &amp; Timbers, and had been impressed. ''Jeff was my first choice,'' Mr. Wadhwa said. ''He was in the lead by a mile.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wadhwa had expected to pay about $100,000 for Mr. Christian's services, but Mr. Christian also demanded equity equal to about a third of what the new president would get in his first year. The least he would take was 75,000 shares, according to Mr. Wadhwa. Those options were worth $375,000 since the shares had been valued at about $5 each during the latest round of financing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christian says that search firms are entitled to an equity position for their work. ''The philosophy that we had was there were lots of ideas and lots of money, but there was a shortage of talent,'' he said. Receiving warrants or options aligns his firm's interests with those of its clients and the candidates it is recruiting, he said.</p>
        <p>''Search firms are becoming a little more like venture guys,'' he said. Mr. Wadhwa ''did not value the relationship of a good search firm as others did.''</p>
        <p>Wayne Luke of Heidrick &amp; Struggles also wanted cash and equity, Mr. Wadhwa said. Heidrick declined to comment. But the firm has a policy not to do any searches for a chief executive or chief operating officer for pre-public technology companies unless it receives warrants, according to a spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>At the suggestion of Mr. Johnson, the venture capitalist, Mr. Wadhwa then contacted Ms. Forbes. She, too, was interested in equity. ''I like having skin in the game,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Unlike the other recruiters, though, Ms. Forbes proved willing to negotiate because she was more interested in the exposure the search might offer. The two eventually struck a deal where she would get just 5,000 options, worth perhaps $25,000, and an $80,000 fee. ''It was worth it in this case,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Wadhwa was initially concerned about going with a less- established recruiter, Ms. Forbes argued that she would devote more time and energy to the task than the better-known firms. She quickly supplied him with a list of names. Within weeks, Relativity hired Michael J. Espina, who had been a senior executive with Computer Associates International.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espina said he was not looking for a job and had turned away calls from other recruiters. Even though Ms. Forbes was not at a ''big name-brand'' firm, ''she was persistent,'' he said, and got him to schedule a short meeting, which stretched on for six hours. About a month later, he was on board.</p>
