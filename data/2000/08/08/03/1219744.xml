        <p>For the first few soggy, gray days of her family's two-week vacation that started here on Saturday, Barbara Cagliostro had a simple question: Where is everyone?</p>

        <p>For the first few soggy, gray days of her family's two-week vacation that started here on Saturday, Barbara Cagliostro had a simple question: Where is everyone?</p>
        <p>Ms. Cagliostro, who lives in Armonk, N.Y., said her family had been coming here for eight years and had never seen it this empty. ''We were wondering, is it just the weather, or is it that people don't want to come to the Jersey Shore anymore?''</p>
        <p>As many of her fellow vacationers could have told her, it's the weather. From Cape May to Cape Cod, rainy, dank days have turned many family vacations into waterlogged duds.</p>
        <p>Today, Ms. Cagliostro was resting on a blue vinyl lawn chair on the deck of her seaside rental, enjoying the first truly sunny day of her vacation. The day before, Jenkinson's Beach here was closed because of the weather. Lifeguards were told to go home early in the day because it was so overcast. Boutique and restaurant owners complained they were losing money because of the sparse crowds.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Cagliostro sunned herself, her children sold hand-painted seashells to passers-by on the boardwalk for a quarter apiece. ''Even their sales have been down,'' she said.</p>
        <p>It was not clear whether today's sunshine was just a respite or a turn in the weather.  Meteorologists said this July was the coldest one on record in the New York metropolitan region, and one of the wettest. And so far, August looks like it might start off just as damp. Thunderstorms are predicted for Thursday in much of the area, the National Weather Service said, although the weekend could be clear.</p>
        <p>''It should be a pleasant summer weekend,'' said Ingrid Amberger, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Brookhaven, N.Y. She said the long-range forecast for August was for normal rainfall.</p>
        <p>At Jenkinson's Beach and Pavilion, the weather has meant fewer people in the amusement park, fewer crowds to watch the Elvis impersonators parachuting out of planes, and miserable business for local shops.</p>
        <p>''It's been a horrible summer,'' Matt Hrynkiewicz, assistant manager of the Beach Hut Boutique on the boardwalk, said from behind a counter laden with expensive sunglasses and surfer car ornaments. On Monday, he said, the store grossed $300, compared with $3,000 to $4,000 on a good day. ''The thing that's really killed us the most is the forecasts,'' he said. ''People hear it's going to be lousy weather, so they don't come.''</p>
        <p>In fact, while much of New England and Long Island has been drenched, there has been more gray weather than rain here.</p>
        <p>Diana Szala of Robbinsville, N.J., in Mercer County, heard the predictions of rain for Tuesday, but headed to Jenkinson's Beach with her three nieces anyway. When they arrived, the water was off limits to swimmers, but she and her nieces could still sit on the beach, which is all they wanted to do anyway. And the overcast day brought a boon: they didn't have to pay the entry fee to get on the beach, or the $6 for parking.</p>
        <p>''If they had been charging, we wouldn't have come on the beach,'' Ms. Szala said, sitting on a near-empty beach on blankets with her nieces, all in matching blue floral two-piece bathing suits. ''What if we had paid $16.50 to get in, and then in half an hour it rained? We figured if it was nice enough, we'd just walk on the boardwalk. So we're lucky they're not charging today.''</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, figuring that not many people would want to come to the beach because of the gray skies, Jenkinson's Beach officials decided to allow half the lifeguards, and all of the parking attendants, to go home. Red flags were posted to keep people out of the water, the fifth or sixth day the beaches were closed in the last month, officials said.</p>
        <p>''With the weather the way it is, financially it doesn't make any sense to keep it open and keep our staff here,'' said Marilou Halvorsen, director of marketing for Jenkinson's.</p>
        <p>People in other parts of the region have been coping with cabin fever as their vacations were rained on.</p>
        <p>In Amagansett, on Long Island, the rain drove Janice Horowitz and her husband, Richard Bookstaber, to stock up on arts and crafts projects for their two children. The family began their two-week summer rental, which they would only say cost them ''thousands,'' on Saturday.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Bookstaber and his children went swimming in the ocean despite a drizzle. The next day, for lack of anything better to do, they went to a bowling alley, which was so crowded that the manager was taking reservations, Ms. Horowitz said. She decided to go shopping in East Hampton, but found that much of the village parking lot was flooded, forcing her to turn back.</p>
        <p>''It is definitely just a funny experience,'' Ms. Horowitz said. ''The  rain is what all of the people are talking about. I'm calling friends up  and asking them what to do with kids in the rain.''</p>
        <p>On Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, which had a day and a half of sun between July 16 and 30, Jill Sacks and her family from Westchester County have spent much of their time watching water drip from the kitchen ceiling and mice scurrying across the floors. The swimming pool -- the main reason why the family was renting the house -- has overflowed twice.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sacks did not want to give the exact rental price of the home, but said their stay of two and a half weeks cost more than a family vacation to Europe. In fact, she said, the family had decided to forgo a trip to the Mediterranean partly because they thought they would spend time in the pool.</p>
        <p>''It feels like September, or the end of August, when the hurricanes come in,'' Ms. Sacks said Tuesday. ''It's driving rain, and it's relentless.''</p>
        <p>Today, finally, the sun shone on Martha's Vineyard for a few minutes in the morning.</p>
        <p>The weather has taken its toll on other outdoor activities. In the Berkshires in Massachusetts, the renowned Tanglewood music series  has taken a hit because of the rains, said Caroline Smedvig, a spokeswoman for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, which performs every weekend in the series. About 40 percent of Tanglewood's business comes from lawn seats, Ms. Smedvig said.</p>
        <p>The concerts usually draw their largest crowds, up to 15,000 people, on Sunday afternoons. But last Sunday, only about 5,100 tickets were sold -- 19 of those out on the lawn, Ms. Smedvig said.</p>
        <p>In Point Pleasant Beach, some families were taking the gloomy weather in stride, partly because they could find other things to occupy their time. Even with the ocean off limits to swimming, there was the amusement park. There, Tuesday was armband day, which meant that children could go on all the rides for one price of $10. There was also the Jenkinson's Aquarium, or the arcades and miniature golf. For the grown-ups, there was the Tiki Bar.</p>
        <p>Dave Korey, a police detective from Millstone, N.J., in Monmouth County, has been checking the weather reports on his laptop computer, in between going out to the beach with his wife, Karen, and children Mikayla, 3, and Dave, 1.</p>
        <p>''You've got to take the good days with the bad,'' Mr. Korey said.</p>
        <p>This is the second year the couple has rented a house on the boardwalk for three weeks, and they came well prepared for whatever nature threw at them. They made two trips from home to stock up their three-week rental with enough videos and toys, such as a kiddie pool, to keep their children busy, they said.</p>
        <p>''I said to him, we lucked out, because it's not too hot, and it's not too crowded here,'' Mrs. Korey said, pointing out that the temperatures have been in the 60's at night.</p>
        <p>Despite the clouds, it has been warm enough to go swimming, Mr. Korey said. ''Yesterday they could have made a commercial out here, or a picture for a postcard, because there was no one on the beach,'' he said. ''It's been great.''</p>
