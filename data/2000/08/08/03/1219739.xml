        <p>The limousine stopped, and Zab Judah stepped out. It was time for work.</p>
        <p>Judah walked down several flights of stairs yesterday into the dungeon-like atmosphere of the Church Street Gym in lower Manhattan, where perspiration filled the muggy air, where various boxers were pounding away at heavy bags.</p>
        <p>Judah felt comfortable in this environment, perhaps more comfortable than he felt in the air-conditioned limousine. With an unbeaten record (23-0, 17 knockouts) and an insatiable appetite for boxing, Judah, a native of Brooklyn, has become the International Boxing Federation junior welterweight champion at age 22. And relinquishing the title is not in his plans.</p>
        <p>So while he faces a tough test Saturday night against the former champion Terronn Millett (22-1-1) in a 12-round title bout at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Conn., Judah did not look worried. Instead, he sounded ready.</p>
        <p>''I have respect for Terronn Millett, because he did the work it took to be a former champion, and that's not easy to do,'' Judah said. ''But at the end of the night, I'm leaving with the belt. I have never in my life turned down a fight. I say, 'Bring it on.'''</p>
        <p>Judah brings immense talent to the ring. He is a quick, stylish southpaw boxer who combines speed with knockout power. One of seven brothers who all box, Judah has been called a harder-hitting version of former champion Pernell Whitaker, his close friend. Four of Judah's last five fights have ended in four rounds or less. Some fighters outbox their opponents, while others outslug them. Judah can do both.</p>
        <p>''If Pernell hit like Zab, Pernell would still be a champion,'' said Lou Duva, Judah's co-manager, who also worked with Whitaker. ''The thing I like about Zab is that you can't get him to stop working. He has an entourage, but it's a good one, his father, his brothers, all of them committed to him, and to boxing. I think this kid's going to be a star.''</p>
        <p>But first, Judah must beat the 32-year-old Millett. Millett was supposed to fight Judah months ago, but the bout was postponed after Millett broke his right hand in a knockout victory over Virgil McClendon in July 1999. The I.B.F. eventually stripped Millett of his title, and matched Judah against Jan Bergman for the championship last February. Judah knocked out Bergman in the fourth round, and in his last fight, on June 24, won a 12-round decision over Junior Witter.</p>
        <p>Judah took only a week off after the Witter fight; he admits he gets antsy when he does not box. A student of the game, Judah can often be spotted sitting ringside at fights around the country.</p>
        <p>''You're never too good to learn something,'' he said. ''I consider myself still learning, still getting better. Once you get to the point you think you're too good to learn, you're in trouble.</p>
        <p>''I like to watch a lot of guys -- Felix Trinidad, Oscar De La Hoya, even guys making their professional debut. To be the best, you have to love it. I love it.''</p>
        <p>Judah would not reveal a plan for Saturday's bout, but he wondered how sharp Millett would be, not having fought since July 1999.</p>
        <p>''He's got all that ring rust, and now he's going to fight me?,'' Judah said. ''We'll see.''</p>
        <p>If Judah wins, possible high-profile bouts against the World Boxing Council superlightweight champion, Kosyta Tszyu, or Shane Mosley could be offered. Judah plans to fight another year at 140 pounds, then move up to 147 pounds.</p>
        <p>However, Judah knows that many fighters have been burned looking too far ahead. His focus is on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''I've trained for what it is -- a world championship fight,'' he said. ''If you're not ready by now, you might as well hand the title over. I'm ready.''</p>
        <p>PUNCH LINES</p>
        <p>Saturday's undercard will feature a 10-round lightweight bout between North American Boxing Federation lightweight champion, JUAN LAZCANO (23-2-1) and the former World Boxing Council 130-pound champion, JESSE JAMES LEIJA (40-4-2). . . .Before his workout yesterday, Judah met with several children from the Family Center, a New York organization that provides legal and social services for children with seriously ill parents.</p>
