        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio returned to New York yesterday from the Republican National Convention, and, among other stops, appeared on the radio talk show of Bob Grant, who once drew criticism for derogatory remarks about blacks and Hispanics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio spent about 20 minutes chatting with Mr. Grant and a few of his listeners on WWOR.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grant, a commentator for nearly 30 years, was fired from WABC in 1996 for what station managers said was an inappropriate remark about the death in a plane crash of Ron Brown, the former commerce secretary. Before that, he publicly feuded with New Jersey's Republican governor, Christine Todd Whitman, in 1994. Once a frequent guest, Mrs. Whitman vowed never to appear again on his show after a visit in which she objected to Mr. Grant's racially charged rhetoric.</p>
        <p>He has toned down his commentary in recent years -- ''I got a bum rap,'' he said yesterday -- and Mr. Lazio's appearance was uneventful. Mr. Lazio was asked friendly and routine questions about the state of his Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton, and he responded cheerfully about the race.</p>
        <p>At a news conference before the show, Mr. Lazio sought to draw a contrast with Mr. Grant's past.</p>
        <p>''I stand for inclusion,'' said Mr. Lazio, who appeared on the show a few times before he entered the Senate race in May. ''I think my record reflects that very, very clearly. Bringing people together, finding common ground. I will be responsible for my remarks and myself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides said he accepted Mr. Grant's invitation as part of an effort to appear on a variety of television and radio shows. ''Rick does a lot of interviews,'' said Dan McLagan, his chief spokesman. ''He has been interviewed on over 25 media outlets in the last 36 hours, from CNN to America's Black Forum to MTV.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McLagan also noted that Lanny J. Davis, President Clinton's former special counsel and a supporter of Mrs. Clinton's candidacy, appeared on the Grant show last week. Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said Mr. Davis was not a paid adviser and only contacts the campaign when he is planning to appear on a television show to speak about Mrs. Clinton's candidacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfson said Mr. Lazio should have skipped the show because of Mr. Grant's past. ''He was willing to run with Pat Buchanan on the Independence Party line to win votes. He is willing to go on Bob Grant to win votes,'' he said. ''I'm beginning to wonder what he won't do to win votes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also appeared on ''The O'Reilly Factor'' on the Fox News Channel yesterday. In the first part of a two-part interview that concludes today, he answered questions on a broad range of topics, including abortion. Mr. Lazio said he favors abortion rights, but has been criticized by Mrs. Clinton for not supporting public financing of abortions and opposing late-term procedures.</p>
        <p>In the interview, he suggested that life begins at conception. ''I believe there is a very special status when there is conception,'' said Mr. Lazio, who added that he nevertheless believes government should not make abortion illegal.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 5, 2000, Saturday  An article on Thursday about Representative Rick A. Lazio's appearance on ''The Bob Grant Show'' misstated the call letters of the radio station that carries it. The station is WOR-AM (710), not WWOR.</p>
