        <p>One of the best-loved characters in the world of bridge half a century ago was Harry J. Fishbein, the proprietor of the famous Mayfair Club in New York City. He will be inducted into the American Contract Bridge League's Hall of Fame at ceremonies in Anaheim, Calif., next Thursday.</p>
        <p>Fishbein was born in 1898, and in his teens he played the prototype form of bridge, which allowed unlimited redoubling. He recalled a game in which the bidding started with a base of 8 points and reached 4,096, but he never said whether he won it or lost it. As a young man he played professional basketball, earning trivial sums of money by playing in small gyms, usually as a curtain raiser for a dance.</p>
        <p>He bacame a strong auction bridge player and eagerly took up the new game of contract, introduced to the United States by Harold Vanderbilt in 1926. In 1936 Fishbein won the prestigious Vanderbilt Cup, when his team upset the favored Four Aces, and he won again in 1943. He won the Master Pairs twice, the challenging Masters Individual once and had a series of second-place finishes in national events.</p>
        <p>He had a quirky sense of humor. At a tournament a woman approached him in some excitement. ''I hear Harry Fishbein is here. He won the Masters Individual last year. Can you point him out to me?'' she asked. Harry surveyed the room carefully. ''To tell you the truth, ma'am,'' he responded, ''I can't see him. Ask that tournament director. He knows everyone.'' Others had no trouble identifying him by his trademark beret. He had a large collection and wore a different one each day.</p>
        <p>When he won the Masters Individual in 1942, his defense on the diagramed deal was the talk of the tournament. He sat East, and South's opening four-spade bid ended the auction. The lead was the diamond queen, and South rightly played low from the dummy.</p>
        <p>Fishbein thought this over. Since South had not covered, it was clear that West held the diamond jack with or without a small card. If South had no more diamonds, a second diamond lead would ruin the defense. It was likely that South held eight strong spades and not much else, so Harry overtook the queen with the ace and fired back the club eight. He scored a club ruff, returned a heart to his partner's ace and collected a second club ruff for down two and a top score. South had taken the eight trump tricks he began with, but nothing else. This defense would have been equally essential if West had held a trump trick instead of the heart ace.</p>
        <p>If the opening bid had been three spades instead of four, East-West might have been able to use the famous Fishbein convention. The idea was that a bid of four clubs would be an artificial request for take-out, allowing a double to suggest a penalty. When Harry himself eventually gave this up, the wits said that the Fishbein stuck in his throat.</p>
