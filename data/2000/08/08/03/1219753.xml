        <p>Like nearly all the speakers who have taken the sprawling and colorful stage at the Republican convention here, Melissa Hart, a candidate for Congress from Pennsylvania, made sure to submit an early draft of her remarks to aides to Gov. George W. Bush for review and approval.</p>
        <p>It was returned, she said today, with just one instruction: Cut it to a minute from 90 seconds, with no direction on what she should take out.</p>
        <p>Her experience was not unusual. The week has been characterized by rigid displays of discipline, with Mr. Bush's lieutenants roaming the floor with schedules that list the precise second that each event is supposed to occur, and delegates being handed daily talking points to guide their interviews with reporters.</p>
        <p>But the control over what is being said from the stage has taken a decidedly subtler form, albeit with precisely the uniform result sought by Mr. Bush's aides.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, speeches at the Republican convention in San Diego were diligently reviewed and monitored by convention organizers, who insisted that speakers promise to stick to their script before allowing them to go on. This year, convention organizers have used a velvet hammer on a receptive cast to achieve a uniformity of message, as well as a near silence on topics like abortion, gun control and President Clinton.</p>
        <p>The planners have built each night around a specific theme, carefully choosing elected officials and members of the public who can speak to  that theme. The elected officials are given broad guidelines on what to say and are told as well what not to say: no harsh attacks that can recall the convention of 1992. The convention organizers took care of writing the speeches for everyone else.</p>
        <p>The public figures were asked to submit all speeches for review. The main concerns of the ''auditors,'' as the convention speech screeners are called, has been to keep the talks short and upbeat, so as not to interfere with the snappy, happy production Republicans organizers are seeking to present to the American public, according to speakers and convention officials alike.</p>
        <p>That is not to suggest that dissidents are clamoring for floor time. ''There just hasn't had to be the usual arm-twisting,'' one of Mr. Bush's senior advisers said, with clear relief.</p>
        <p>These are different times, and Republican leaders have made the best of them. There are no rebels trying to commandeer the microphone, and no opposition candidates vying for attention. Indeed, the most potentially risky moment for Mr. Bush's convention organizers should have been when Senator John McCain of Arizona, who lost the nomination to Mr. Bush, appeared on Tuesday. But Mr. McCain had submitted his speech to Mr. Bush in advance, and not a single change was demanded.</p>
        <p>''I saw the draft,'' said Mike Murphy, formerly Mr. McCain's strategist. ''It went to Bush and I saw the draft after it came back. I can't remember a single change.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain was one of Mr. Bush's sharpest critics in the primaries, saying at one point that the governor ''twists the truth'' like Mr. Clinton, and he was the only major rival of the Texas governor to speak at the convention. Yet in this environment, where Republicans are intent on not doing anything that might distract from the march to the nomination, Mr. McCain was not about to harm his future standing with the party.</p>
        <p>Beyond the question of Mr. McCain, Mr. Bush's absolute control of the convention has been evident every night in the choice of speakers and their content, the result of a team that includes Andrew Card, former secretary of transportation who is chairman of the convention, and Ed Gillespie, who is in charge of assigning and reviewing each day's events. With such a free hand, Mr. Bush's advisers built each evening around a theme (''Prosperity with a purpose'' is tonight's).</p>
        <p>In interviews, many speakers said  they were given only general marching orders. Representative Vito J. Fossella, the Staten Island Republican, was asked to speak on Social Security, an interest with which he has been identified in the House and all his life, since his great-grandfather, James A. O'Leary, a congressman who represented Staten Island from 1936 to 1944, voted to create Social Security. ''The conversation was very straightforward: They asked me if I'd be interested in speaking on Social Security and Medicare,'' Mr. Fossella said.</p>
        <p>''They said they wanted a positive speech,'' he said. ''That was it.''</p>
        <p>A Republican aide assigned to help work with speakers in 1996 and this year said there was a marked difference in the process this time. The aide said that one of the main speakers, Gen. Colin F. Powell, was allowed to tinker with his speech up to two hours before he went on. That would not have been permitted when Bob Dole was nominated by a more divided convention in 1996.</p>
        <p>''They would not put a word on the teleprompter until it was scrubbed,'' the aide said of 1996. ''This time, it seemed all they were concerned about was the number of words.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, a number of speakers said that time, not substance, seemed to be the top concern of Mr. Bush's convention organizers. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said that when he submitted his greeting to convention planners for review, they left in a veiled reference to Mr. Specter's support of abortion rights, but asked him to cut a joke that put a positive spin on W. C. Fields's famously disparaging remark about the city and his home state, just to save a few minutes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Specter said he told them that he wanted the joke to stay. And it did.</p>
