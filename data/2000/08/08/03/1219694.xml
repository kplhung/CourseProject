        <p>'Gruesome' Cow Gets the Ax</p>
        <p>DAVID LYNCH'S cow is being sent back to California without making an appearance in New York's cow parade. Too gruesome, says the parks commissioner, HENRY J. STERN.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch, the filmmaker who created the 1990's television drama ''Twin Peaks,'' chopped off the cow's head and stuck forks and knives into its back. He also covered parts of the cow with a reddish substance that looks like blood.</p>
        <p>''I was surprised David Lynch did this,'' Mr. Stern said. ''I thought it was Charles Manson. I don't know whether it's shock art or schlock art. David Lynch should stick to his day job, making movies.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for CowParade NYC 2000, which organized the exhibition of several hundred fiberglass cows on sidewalks around the city, said the group had no comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said that there was a screening process, but that Mr. Lynch's cow had been submitted late without the paperwork that the 1,200 other cow artists submitted. The CowParade organizers ''looked at it and felt it was so obviously gruesome and macabre that it was not fit for display in city streets,'' Mr. Stern said. ''It seems to me a perfectly reasonable conclusion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said the standards for cows were ''artistic.'' Three cows, including one from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, were rejected before the cow parade began in June; the group sued the city and CowParade NYC 2000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch said he was disappointed and dismayed. ''Don't you think when people tell you you're allowed to do whatever you want as long as it's not sexually X-rated, that they should stand behind their word and show your cow?'' Mr. Lynch said yesterday. ''I think they should show my cow proudly and let people make up their own minds.''</p>
        <p>Another Part Of a Toy Story</p>
        <p>Here is a postscript on the announcement that Toys ''R'' Us is planning the world's largest toy store in Times Square:</p>
        <p>Before Toys ''R'' Us signed the deal for space at Broadway and 44th Street, it had been negotiating for a store in the new Reuters Building, two blocks to the south, on the west side of Broadway between 42nd and 43rd Streets. One broker said that deal came apart because Reuters did not want the new tower to become known as the ''Reuters 'R' Us building.''</p>
        <p>WILLIAM C. RUDIN of Rudin Management, Reuters's partner in the tower project, denied that, saying there was simply not enough space in the new building.</p>
        <p>What happened, he said, is that Reuters ended up needing the third floor, which had been planned for retail use. That would have left Toys ''R'' Us with 75,000 square feet, instead of the 100,000 it wanted.</p>
        <p>Simon Chuckles After Simon Sings</p>
        <p>PAUL SIMON, the singer, had something to say after PAUL SIMON, the former Illinois senator, performed ''Hello, Dolly'' with his daughter's blues band last month in Carbondale, Ill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon the singer sent Mr. Simon the former senator a tongue-in-cheek note: ''I am being inundated with requests from bluegrass festivals all over the country asking me to perform and sing 'Hello, Dolly.'</p>
        <p>''Also, do you think you could work up a version of 'Still Crazy After All These Years' into your next set? It would help me a lot,'' the note continued. It was signed, ''Yours truly, the other Paul Simon.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon (the former senator) had written to Mr. Simon (the musician) before the performance, joking that somebody's musical career would plummet when word of the Carbondale performance spread.</p>
        <p>''I was glad to know that he got a kick out of it,'' Mr. Simon the former senator told The Associated Press.</p>
