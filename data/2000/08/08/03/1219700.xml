        <p>A Texas jury has found that a New York lawyer defrauded several hundred relatives of a 19th-century priest more than six decades ago and now owes them millions of dollars in oil royalties and interest, according to a decision announced today in Brownsville.</p>
        <p>Relatives of Padre Nicolas Balli and his nephew Juan Jose Balli had sued the 90-year-old lawyer, Gilbert Kerlin, in 1994, charging that Mr. Kerlin had promised to pay mineral royalties to their families when he began acquiring title to their properties on Padre Island, east of Brownsville, in 1938.</p>

        <p>A Texas jury has found that a New York lawyer defrauded several hundred relatives of a 19th-century priest more than six decades ago and now owes them millions of dollars in oil royalties and interest, according to a decision announced today in Brownsville.</p>
        <p>Relatives of Padre Nicolas Balli and his nephew Juan Jose Balli had sued the 90-year-old lawyer, Gilbert Kerlin, in 1994, charging that Mr. Kerlin had promised to pay mineral royalties to their families when he began acquiring title to their properties on Padre Island, east of Brownsville, in 1938.</p>
        <p>The island, rich in oil and natural gas, is named for Padre Balli, who received title to the land from King Carlos III of Spain. Padre Balli died in 1829, leaving most of the land to his nephew.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerlin had argued during the trial that Padre Balli's nephew had sold the land, about 60,000 acres, in 1830 and that the titles he acquired from the Balli family descendants were thus invalid.</p>
        <p>But lawyers for the family produced evidence in the trial that Mr. Kerlin and his lawyer, F. W. Seabury, had used the titles to back up their claims of ownership when selling surface and mineral rights to the land.</p>
        <p>In the decision announced today, the jury found that Mr. Kerlin had conspired with Mr. Seabury, now deceased, to defraud the unsophisticated Balli landowners by refusing to pay mineral royalties as called for in the deeds of sale.</p>
        <p>The jury found that Mr. Kerlin and Mr. Seabury had acted with malice in another transaction, involving 7,500 acres of surface rights to the island, by claiming to represent the Balli heirs while gaining possession of the land in a 1940's lawsuit but never informing them of their ownership.</p>
        <p>''Today, the Balli family honor is restored,'' said Hector Cardenas, a Balli descendant and one of the lawyers representing the family. ''This isn't the end of the process, but we're very happy with the jury's decision.''</p>
        <p>Though the Balli ancestors have asked for $11 million in unpaid mineral royalties, interest and lawyers' fees, plus an unnamed amount in damages for fraud, the actual amount to be paid has yet to be determined, said lawyers involved in the case.</p>
        <p>''The jury has given us nearly everything we asked for, but there are some differences in the way they want to calculate the royalties,'' said Robert Johnson, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers. ''We haven't calculated what the various awards made today by the jury amount to yet, but it's safe to say that the families will receive several million dollars at least.''</p>
        <p>More than $1.5 million in legal fees were also awarded to the plaintiffs' lawyers, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Another lawyer involved said the family's legal team estimated that unpaid royalties and interest alone would exceed $10 million.</p>
        <p>The jury will begin deliberations about punitive damages on Monday, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Contacted today in New York, Mr. Kerlin, citing an order by the presiding judge in the case not to talk about the lawsuit, would say only, ''We've still got a long way to go yet.''</p>
