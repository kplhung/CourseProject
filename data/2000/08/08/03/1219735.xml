        <p>What disturbs California utility executives and regulators is that this week's crisis has come even though none of the state's power plants or transmission lines has failed, at a time when temperatures around the state have been hot but hardly extraordinary. The state's power supply simply can no longer keep up with peak demand, they warn. [Page A1.]</p>
