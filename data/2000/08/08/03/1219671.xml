        <p>Martin Guggenheim letter says case of Bently Louis Grant, the man wrongly arrested for assaulting Tiffany F Goldberg with a chunk of concrete, is a disturbing illustration of the ability of the police to create an 'overwhelming' case of guilt against an indisputably innocent person</p>

        <p>If not for the sheer happenstance that Bently Louis Grant was in range of the security cameras at the Virgin Megastore at the moment that Tiffany F.

        <p>Why isn't there more public outrage over this case? Isn't anyone troubled by the apparent ability of the police to create an overwhelming case of guilt against an indisputably innocent person?</p>
