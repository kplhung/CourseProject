        <p>In a killing rampage remarkable even for the bloodied mountains and forests of Kashmir, at least 93 people were slain late Tuesday and early today in six separate massacres.</p>
        <p>Most of the dead were innocents: pilgrims on their way to pray at a holy site, laborers working at a brick kiln, villagers awakened from their beds and lined up for killing.</p>
        <p>To many in India the cause of all this killing seemed straightforward enough: a peace initiative last week by one militant group has been deemed a contemptible betrayal by others, requiring sabotage.</p>
        <p>''It is clear that after the Hizbul Mujahedeen called for a cease-fire and talks, other militant groups have been instructed by Pakistan to step up their attacks on innocent and unarmed people,'' India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, told Parliament. He added, ''I will tell these terrorists that we will not bow down to their threats.''</p>
        <p>But Pakistan, as well as several of the militant groups critical of the peace initiative, denied any responsibility for the multiple attacks.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry issued a statement asserting that India's own ruthless conniving might be to blame. ''On previous occasions,'' the ministry said, ''terrorist acts aimed at civilians have been carried out by renegade elements at the behest of the Indian security forces, to malign the Kashmiri freedom struggle internationally.''</p>
        <p>Each of the two countries now occupies part of Kashmir, though India's share is far larger and includes the valley that is the heart of Kashmiri culture.</p>
        <p>Since 1989, Pakistan-backed militants have been rebelling against Indian rule. An estimated 25,000 to 40,000 people have died in the fighting.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Hizbul Mujahedeen -- one of the main insurgents -- declared a unilateral cease-fire for three months, a surprise announcement that brought an offer of talks from India and condemnation from other Islamic militants in the fray.</p>
        <p>The Kashmir dispute is a deep morass, and while little common ground would seem to exist between the Hizbul and India, plans for discussions appeared to be going forward, so violent efforts to derail the process could hardly be unexpected.</p>
        <p>Many in India have presumed that the Hizbul Mujahedeen would not have declared a cease-fire without at least the tacit approval of Pakistan's military government, which has been under pressure from the United States.</p>
        <p>Inflamed oratory aside, the attacks raise questions about whether Pakistan indeed favors the new dialogue and how much capacity it has to control the militants.</p>
        <p>The attacks were particularly jarring and heinous, and the victims were overwhelmingly Hindu. In the worst incident, gunmen opened fire on pilgrims on their way to a religious shrine at Pahalgam, 55 miles south of Srinagar. The death toll in that one incident has risen to 33, according to hospital officials.</p>
        <p>In a small brickmaking community near the town of Anantnag, attackers forced people from their homes, lined up the men and shot them. Eighteen died there.</p>
        <p>Curfews have since been imposed in parts of the state. The authorities say they fear a violent Hindu backlash against Muslims.</p>
        <p>For their part, the Hizbul Mujahedeen were loath to suggest that any militant groups had taken part in the massacres. Instead, the group's chief, Sayed Salahuddin, demanded that India's leaders come to the table without any preconditions and be ready to discuss Kashmiri secession.</p>
