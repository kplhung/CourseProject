        <p>The government of Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori was slammed by its second political scandal in a week when one of his top advisers admitted accepting millions of yen in questionable donations.</p>
        <p>The chief cabinet secretary, Hidenao Nakagawa, who is the government's top spokesman, acknowledged that he had received 8.5 million yen, or $77,810 at current exchange rates, from two people in 1997. The maximum legal donation an individual can make to a politician is 1.5 million yen -- and the amounts that came to Mr. Nakagawa above that limit arrived in a roundabout way.</p>
        <p>As the government's spokesman, Mr. Nakagawa holds what is arguably the second-highest ranking job after the prime minister's. Additionally, he is a member of the inner circle of ruling party politicians that call the shots behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>''There were no legal violations involved, and I reported to the Home Affairs Ministry,'' Mr. Nakagawa said, denying any impropriety. ''But I will be careful in the future not to repeat it.''</p>
        <p>The donations may not have been illegal, and it is unclear if Mr. Nakagawa will be forced to step down or will face legal action.</p>
        <p>But on Sunday, Kimitaka Kuze,  another cabinet member, was forced to resign as chairman of the Financial Reconstruction Commission after acknowledging that he had received 230 million yen, or $2.1 million, for advisory work for the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation  over 13 years that ended in 1996. He also accepted 100 million yen from a condominium developer.</p>
        <p>There has been much speculation about why the scandals are breaking one after the other. Many believe that it may be the result of turmoil inside the party as members jockey to determine who will take on the mantle of Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister whose influence shaped Japanese politics for three decades until he died shortly before the recent election.</p>
        <p>''Of course, money politics is nothing new in Japan, so the question is why are all these revelations coming out now?'' Marshall Gittler, a currency strategist at the Bank of America, asked in a report to investors. ''It looks as if someone has it in for Prime Minister Mori,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mori's cabinet, appointed after general elections last month in which his ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a drubbing in urban areas, is suffering some of the lowest approval ratings of any government since World War II.</p>
        <p>The prime minister, who is currently undergoing a grilling by Parliament over various financial matters, has been limited to using prepared scripts because of his penchant for unwittingly making politically incorrect comments. During the parliamentary debate on Tuesday, he read the same answer in response to three different questions.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Nakagawa's insistence that he did nothing illegal, the way in which the money arrived suggests that someone who was involved knew that the donations were not kosher.</p>
        <p>In one case, a Hiroshima businessman donated a total of 4.5 million yen to Mr. Nakagawa.</p>
        <p>The amount allowed by law, 1.5 million yen, was accounted for as a donation, according to a Home Affairs Ministry report. But an additional 3 million yen went to two political groups that then turned the money over to Mr. Nakagawa, the report said.</p>
