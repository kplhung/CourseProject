        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Republican Party's Exercise in Minstrelsy,'' by Brent Staples (Editorial Observer, Aug. 2):</p>
        <p>I disagree with Mr. Staples's view of the Republican National Convention. George W. Bush has a long history of bringing together people of different races and political viewpoints in Texas, and not just as window dressing but to get positive things done. It's about time we had such a man in Washington to create an environment of cooperation.</p>

        <p>Re ''The Republican Party's Exercise in Minstrelsy,'' by Brent Staples (Editorial Observer, Aug. 2):</p>
        <p>I disagree with Mr. Staples's view of the Republican National Convention. George W. Bush has a long history of bringing together people of different races and political viewpoints in Texas, and not just as window dressing but to get positive things done. It's about time we had such a man in Washington to create an environment of cooperation.</p>
        <p>Also, this race is not about a former president, George Bush, and a soon-to-be former president, Bill Clinton, as Maureen Dowd suggests (column, Aug. 2). Rather, it is a choice between a governor with a strong record and a man who can't seem to figure out who he is.</p>
