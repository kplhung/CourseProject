        <p>HAUPPAUGE: THE HUMAN TOUCH -- Suffolk County government agencies are rushing to comply with a county law enacted in March that requires them to give callers a choice of speaking to an operator instead of computerized voice-mail. The law's sponsor, Steve Levy, Democrat of Holbrook, said taxpayers deserved not to be annoyed when calling the government. Agencies have until September to change answering systems that lack the option.</p>

        <p>HUNTINGTON: MOSQUITO SPRAYER FINED -- A Long Island landscaping company that falsely claimed that its bug spray would kill mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus has agreed to pay a $35,000 fine and immediately suspend its advertising. The company, Green Island Tree Spray of Huntington, advertised its service while warning of ''the very real threat of an encephalitic mosquito outbreak.'' But the state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, whose office investigated the claim, said the spray was not effective against mosquitoes. A lawyer for Green Island said the company had been misled by the spray's manufacturer.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: OFFICER CHARGED -- Federal agents charged a New York City police officer yesterday with using interstate communications to try to entice a minor into having sex. Prosecutors charged that the officer, Philip Amatulli of Bronxville, sent e-mail to an undercover agent posing as a 14-year-old girl. In one of his messages Mr. Amatulli included a photograph of himself in uniform sitting in a police car, according to court papers. Mr. Amatulli's lawyer, Rene Medina, said his client was not guilty.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: DEMOLITION PROTEST -- About 125 Edgar Allan Poe admirers, historic preservationists and Greenwich Village residents gathered near Washington Square Park yesterday to protest plans to demolish the buildings on a block that includes Poe's former home. New York University plans to tear down the row of houses and replace them with a 13-story law school building. Carrying signs that read ''Shame on N.Y.U.'' and ''No No Poe Won't Go,'' the subdued crowd read from Poe's poem ''The Raven'' to protest the plans.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: ASTHMA HOSPITALIZATION -- The number of New York City children entering hospitals as a result of asthma declined 27 percent from 1997 to 1998, city officials said. They attributed the drop in part to an intensified effort in city health clinics, schools and elsewhere to improve asthma treatment and prevention. In 1998, 10,727 city children 14 years and younger were admitted to hospitals for asthma, or 7.2 hospitalizations per 1,000 children, down from 9.9 in 1997. Health care advocates said city officials might be too quick in claiming credit because additional research was needed to confirm why hospitalization rates dropped.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: POLICE OFFICER STAYS HOME -- City officials are wondering why their former acting police chief, Deborah Barrows, has not returned to work. On July 17, hours before City Manager Saundra Kee Borges demoted Ms. Barrows to her prior rank of captain because of what was termed poor performance, Ms. Barrows said she was taking a 10-day medical leave. She had sought treatment for chest pains the previous weekend. City officials said Captain Barrows had not returned since the leave expired July 27. Reached at home, Captain Barrows declined to comment.</p>

        <p>WEST HARTFORD: GAS PRICES FALL -- The average price of a gallon of gas in Connecticut dropped from $1.79 on July 1 to $1.72 on Aug. 1, according to the monthly AAA gasoline price survey. A law cutting the state's gas tax to 25 cents a gallon, from 32 cents, took effect on July 1, but it was unclear whether the price drop was completely due to the tax cut. The national average for a gallon of regular unleaded was $1.52 on Tuesday, down from $1.65 on July 1.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: GRANDPARENT FINANCIAL SUPPORT -- Grandparents cannot be forced to provide financial support for their grandchildren, even if the parents are minors, an appeals court ruled this week. The mother of a teenage mother sued the father of the baby's father to help support a 21-month-old girl. Court documents do not identify the teenagers or their parents. The court noted that no state law required that grandparents be responsible for grandchildren.</p>

        <p>CAMDEN: HOUSING PROGRAM SET -- New Jersey will spend $5.5 million on new housing and other improvements for the Cooper Plaza area of downtown Camden, adding to more than $2 million already spent at the site in a program meant to attract middle-class families back to New Jersey's poorest city. The money will also help expand off-street parking and create a neighborhood park, the state Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency said.</p>

        <p>TOMS RIVER: POLLUTION SUIT FILED -- A second class-action lawsuit alleging that the former Ciba-Geigy Corporation polluted the air and water also says the former Toms River Water Company failed to protect the public water supply. An earlier suit said Ciba-Geigy, now known as Ciba Specialty Chemical Corporation, contaminated Dover Township's water. The latest suit says that 201 people were harmed when Ciba mishandled waste from its dye manufacturing operations and that United Water Toms River, formerly known as Toms River Water Company, failed to protect water purity. Spokesmen for both companies denied wrongdoing.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: INSPECTION STICKERS MISSING -- The New Jersey State Division of Motor Vehicles said 242 auto-emission inspection stickers were missing and might be headed for sale on the black market. New Jersey drivers are required to have such stickers on their cars. A state audit found last spring that the stickers were missing from 11 automobile inspection stations, including those at Secaucus and Paramus. Sixty-four employees at the stations are being questioned.</p>
