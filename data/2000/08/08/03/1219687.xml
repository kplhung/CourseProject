        <p>The Ford Motor Company is deep in negotiations with the Changan Automobile Group to build an affordable passenger car in China, the latest in a series of signs that the country is loosening its grip on the auto industry ahead of its expected entry into the World Trade Organization later this year.</p>
        <p>Ford has tried for years to get into the Chinese market after having lost to General Motors in a fierce competition in the mid-90's for the last major car deal sanctioned under the government's auto-industry master plan. After G.M. won the right to build Buicks in Shanghai, officials started talking instead about shutting manufacturers down. China has more than 100 car manufacturers, including those that assemble cars using kits imported from abroad.</p>
        <p>But China fears that without an expanded domestic car manufacturing base, imports could quickly dominate the growing market after the country joins the W.T.O. So the government is relaxing its grip on the industry, allowing car companies rather than officials in Beijing to decide what the market can bear.</p>
        <p>Honda was allowed to buy a defunct Peugeot joint venture in Guangdong province, in the south, several years ago, and earlier this year Toyota signed a deal to make passenger cars in the city of Tianjin, in the northeast. Car companies have also been allowed to set their own prices again; after a price war in the late 90's, officials had stopped the industry from cutting prices further . The Chinese joint ventures of Citroen, Volkswagen and General Motors have all reduced prices on their cars in the last few months.</p>
        <p>While China's automobile sales growth has been sluggish in recent years and the market has fallen far short of the ebullient estimates made in the mid-90's, no one doubts that the country will eventually become a major auto market. The cities are already choked with cars, but the country's eastern region is crisscrossed with new highways, most of them largely empty of vehicles. And a campaign to develop the long-neglected western region includes plans to build more roads there.</p>
        <p>Already, manufacturers like G.M. are reporting an unexpected surge in the number of private car buyers. And small, affordable cars, like the boxy Suzuki Alto already made by Changan, are the fastest-growing segment of the market.</p>
        <p>In June, Beijing finally gave Ford the go-ahead to negotiate a joint venture. ''Changan and Ford are now in negotiations trying to formalize details and prepare the proper documents required to put the proposal to the government for a final approval,'' said Kenneth Hsu, a Ford spokesman in China.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hsu declined to talk about what kind of car might be built or how large the venture might be, but auto analysts suggest that Ford is considering a version of its Ikon, a compact four-door sedan that the company created for the Indian market. The car would be larger than Changan's Alto but still in a price range that would put it in reach of China's new private car buyers.</p>
        <p>Ford currently has six Chinese joint ventures producing auto parts and offering after-sales service. It also has a 30 percent stake in the Jiangling Motors Corporation, which makes the Ford Transit, a light commercial van.</p>
        <p>Ford is not the only maker contemplating a small car. Toyota's joint venture in Tianjin will produce one. And because China has relaxed restrictions on new models by joint ventures, Volkswagen is expected to soon introduce a small car at its Shanghai venture. General Motors has studied building a version of the Opel Corsa at its Shanghai plant. The company has so far declined to comment on reports suggesting that it may introduce a small-car model as early as this year.</p>
