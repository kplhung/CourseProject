        <p>Two of the biggest companies that solicit proxies from shareholders during major mergers and acquisitions are doing a deal of their own.</p>
        <p>Georgeson Shareholder Communications, the world's largest proxy solicitations company, will announce today that it has acquired Corporate Investor Communications, the third largest firm in the rather insular industry of shareholder communications. Terms of the deal are not expected to be disclosed.</p>
        <p>As consolidation continues across most major industries at a quick clip, companies like Georgeson and C.I.C. work with the affected companies to communicate with their shareholders about their deals.</p>
        <p>According to the two companies, their deal will give them the capacity to communicate with more than 100 million shareholders a year by mail, e-mail, telephone, fax and the Web. The combined company will communicate with 200,000 shareholders a day by phone, representing 3,000 corporate clients and will deal with most of the mutual fund industry.</p>
        <p>While Georgeson, based in New York, is known for its proxy solicitation business during hostile takeovers, C.I.C., based in Carlstadt, N.J., works much more behind the scenes on deals, responsible for the actual printing and mailing of proxies.</p>
        <p>William M. Crane, Georgeson's president, said the acquisition was prompted by a fundamental change in his company's market.</p>
