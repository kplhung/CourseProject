        <p>CONNIE BACON, a regular seller on eBay, thought that she had brokered an excellent deal. On behalf of a consignment shop in Charleston, S.C., she had sold a Rolex watch for $13,500 in an online auction, and everything had gone smoothly.</p>
        <p>A man who identified himself as Kelvin Johanis had put the money in an escrow account, assuring Ms. Bacon that the payment was good, and the shopkeeper had shipped the package to a house specified by the buyer in Lynwood, Wash.</p>
        <p>A few hours later, Ms. Bacon got an urgent e-mail message from I-Escrow, the company holding the payment. I-Escrow said the buyer was suspected of using a stolen credit card. Please, the message pleaded, do not ship the watch.</p>
        <p>''I was shaking,'' Ms. Bacon said. ''This was a $13,500 watch that wasn't mine.''</p>
        <p>She had good reason to be concerned. Online sellers are even more vulnerable to fraud than online buyers, experts say. Those who buy faulty or fake goods through online auctions or Web shops have some recourse; insurance programs and credit card companies will often come to their rescue and credit their accounts, at least up to a certain amount.</p>
        <p>But individuals who are selling goods in online auctions have little protection. Stolen credit cards, fake money orders and bounced checks are risks they face. For them, the adage is turned on its head: Seller beware.</p>
        <p>In Ms. Bacon's case, she was not the only Ebay seller who did business with the person who called himself Mr. Johanis. His real name was Michael Prime, according to court documents, and he turned out to be a 19-year-old unemployed high school graduate in Brier, Wash.</p>
        <p>According to I-Escrow's investigators (informally known as the fraud squad), Mr. Prime had opened 25 accounts on the I-Escrow system and had been in contact with at least nine sellers. He had used stolen credit cards to get almost $20,000 worth of  merchandise, including laptop computers, other Rolex watches and three remote-controlled scale-model helicopters.</p>
        <p>When people worry about fraud in online auctions, they do not usually think about buyers like Mr. Prime. They assume that they are most likely to be deceived by sellers -- particularly by people hawking counterfeit or broken merchandise.</p>
        <p>''That is really not true,'' said Dr. Audri Lanford, a sociologist and editor of an e-mail newsletter, Scambusters.org. ''Fraud is a huge issue, but it is from the seller's perspective.''</p>
        <p>In fact, online sellers are 1O to 18 times as likely as bricks and mortar merchants to lose merchandise to people using stolen credit cards, according to a survey by the Gartner Group, a market research company. The survey, which was released in July and polled 166 retailers, showed that 1.13 percent of all online transactions were conducted with stolen cards.</p>
        <p>Once online sellers accept a stolen card, they often find that the credit card company is of no help. Under federal law, the owner of the credit card would not have to pay for those items. The credit card companies do not have to cover the cost either; they are liable for the purchases only if the seller got a signature from the card holder. So the seller bears the cost and will never be paid.</p>
        <p>A year ago, that might not have sounded like an issue for consumers to worry about. But now, with auction sites like those offered by eBay, Yahoo and Amazon.com, consumers can be sellers as easily as they can be buyers. Today, millions of people are selling goods online, with no background in running a business and none of the resources used by traditional businesses if things go awry.</p>
        <p>Until recently, most individuals selling through online auctions have not been able to accept credit cards and have had to worry only about bounced checks. But this spring, the introduction of credit card services like Billpoint have made it possible for anyone -- even someone selling one item -- to take credit cards online. Now people who have no business savvy, and who may simply be selling miscellaneous items to clean out their basements, are vulnerable to the same credit card fraud that is plaguing online merchants.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bacon, an antique-glassware trader who can often be spotted on eBay under the name GrayHorse, was an experienced online auctioneer when she decided to help a consignment shop sell the Rolex last summer. She had already run into a few problems, mainly with buyers who retracted their bids. But she was still not prepared when she heard that the sellers she was acting for had been defrauded by Mr. Prime. ''I felt very violated,'' she said. ''It made me very angry.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Prime, it turned out, was doing more than simply using stolen credit cards. Those involved with the case say that he is a whiz with computers, though he has little education beyond high school. His lawyer, Tim Tesh, described his client as ''one of these self-taught kids who can just pick it up.''</p>
        <p>According to I-Escrow, Mr. Prime first registered for accounts using stolen cards in July 1999. But I-Escrow detected that the accounts were based on stolen cards and quickly canceled them.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Prime tried to get around the system. According to I-Escrow, he told sellers that he wanted to use I-Escrow and would start the process of setting up accounts. But instead of completing the transaction through the escrow service, officials said, Mr. Prime would close the deal by pretending to be an escrow agent and sending messages from ''I</p>
