        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Churches and synagogues have been enjoying digitally sampled organs since 1971, when the late Jerome Markowitz introduced the Allen Digital Computer Organ. He was a quiet genius who bet the future of his company on untried technology. Much of the musical sampling we now take for granted was created in his lab. Using computer code, Mr. Markowitz was able to produce the complex wave forms and attack and decay envelopes that give organ pipes a unique sound. There are almost 40,000 Allen computer organs in churches throughout the world, including the largest pipe-digital hybrid organ ever built.</p>

        <p>Churches and synagogues have been enjoying digitally sampled organs since 1971, when the late Jerome Markowitz introduced the Allen Digital Computer Organ. He was a quiet genius who bet the future of his company on untried technology. Much of the musical sampling we now take for granted was created in his lab. Using computer code, Mr. Markowitz was able to produce the complex wave forms and attack and decay envelopes that give organ pipes a unique sound. There are almost 40,000 Allen computer organs in churches throughout the world, including the largest pipe-digital hybrid organ ever built.</p>
        <p>The bickering among organists concerning the tone quality produced is similar to the great office debate of the 1970's between word processors and typewriters. To the listener in the church or synagogue pew, the organ tone created by the computer is identical to that from a pipe organ. To the church treasurer, the difference is profound because digital organs, unlike their pipe organ cousins, never require tuning and seldom need service. I sold two of the first three Allen Digital Organs ever built. They are still in use every Sunday.  LEE STADELE  Belle Mead, N.J.</p>
        <p>The writer is a distributor for Allen Organs and has sold electronic organs for 50 years and digital organs for 29 years.</p>
