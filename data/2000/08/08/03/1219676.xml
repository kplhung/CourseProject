        <p>Harry N. Abrams Inc. agreed to pay about $6 million to acquire the assets of Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, combining two prominent publishers of illustrated books.</p>
        <p>Abrams, a unit of the French publishing concern La Martiniere Groupe, is one of the largest publishers of illustrated art books in the United States. One of its best-selling recent titles is the two-volume photograph collection, ''African Ceremonies.''</p>
        <p>Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang was founded 20 years ago by former Abrams executives, including Andrew Stewart, the former husband of the publisher and television personality Martha Stewart.</p>
        <p>Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang specializes in coffee-table books about subjects like cooking, decorating and gardening, as well as popular art books like the recent Blue Dog series.</p>
        <p>Paul Gottlieb, chief executive of Abrams, said the acquisition would broaden its business into more consumer books, which it could also sell overseas through its parent company's French and German units. ''We admire their attitude towards style and presentation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Abrams acquisition also includes Golden Turtle Press, a calendar publisher with licenses to publish calendars featuring characters from Star Wars, the World Wildlife Fund and the HBO television series ''The Sopranos.''</p>
        <p>U.S. Media Holdings, based in New York, acquired Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang five years ago and this spring filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in New York. In February, the company listed assets of $24.7 million and liabilities of $25 million.</p>
        <p>The bankruptcy court this week approved the Abrams bid for Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang. The deal is expected to be completed next week.</p>
