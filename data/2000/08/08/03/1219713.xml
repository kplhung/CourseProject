        <p>WE'RE used to hearing Public Advocate Mark Green and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani disagree about the city's Police Department. And the Rev. Al Sharpton and Police Commissioner Howard Safir. And many other local public figures with opinions about what is right and wrong about city policing.</p>
        <p>But the very federal panel that swooped into town to advise us on the N.Y.P.D.? Yes, members of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, which issued a report that first circulated in April, are in sharp disagreement, raising the question of just what Washington has accomplished by adding two more partisan voices to an already divisive issue.</p>
        <p>The commission report, ''Police Practices and Civil Rights in New York City,'' criticizes just about every aspect of the Police Department's race relations, from recruitment to promotions. Eliciting angry charges of partisanship from the mayor, it accuses officers of engaging in racial profiling and recommends that an independent prosecutor investigate the most serious allegations of police misconduct.</p>
        <p>Not all commissioners agreed, and now come strong words from the two dissenters. In a seven-page statement, not yet publicly released, Russell G. Redenbaugh and Carl A. Anderson say: ''Instead of providing a meaningful discourse on police-community relations in New York, the report is, itself, an exercise in profiling. The attack it makes is based not on evidence, but on conjecture, opinion and perception as reality.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Redenbaugh, a director of an investment firm in Philadelphia, and Mr. Anderson, a board member of the Knights of Columbus in New Haven, roundly denounce the report as ''a sweeping indictment of the New York Police Department.''</p>
        <p>It would seem that outsiders could bring some clarity to a fundamental issue facing New Yorkers: whether aggressive policing, while contributing to the drop in crime, has chipped away at the civil rights of minority New Yorkers. A critical question, especially now, in the aftermath of the police killings of Amadou Diallo and Patrick M. Dorismond, both unarmed black men, the torture of Abner Louima, the allegations of racial profiling by the Street Crime Unit.</p>
        <p>But cool analysis demands impartiality. In Washington? Of the eight members of the Civil Rights Commission, four are Democrats, three are independents, one is a Republican. President Clinton named four commissioners, Congressional Democrats named two and Congressional Republicans named two -- the dissenters.</p>
        <p>This is not to suggest that partisanship always skews the work of political appointees. But this report does raise questions about the role politics played in determining its findings. The chairwoman, Mary Frances Berry, is a proud liberal who gave a $250 donation to Hillary Rodham Clinton. (A mistake, Ms. Berry later conceded. That's for sure, since the report would have been a large issue in the Senate campaign if Mr. Giuliani hadn't dropped out.)</p>
        <p>The commission examined reams of material, but held a grand total of one day of hearings in the city. The report includes selective anecdotal material, including, the dissent notes, a police sergeant's remark that recruitment and hiring ''is already prostituted and it's already corrupted.''</p>
        <p>That reflects ''the perceptions of officers of color,'' the commission said. But does a quotation from one critic do that? And why does the report minimize the fact that city police officers use deadly force less than officers in other major cities, presenting that as a department assertion?</p>
        <p>WE do not dispute the number of killings, but the report is about professionalism, protecting civil rights, racial profiling,'' Ms. Berry said in a recent phone interview. But it would seem relevant to all New Yorkers, minorities included, that police shootings are down: 11 people shot dead in 1999 compared with 41 in 1990, for instance.</p>
        <p>''I think they were extremely high-handed and highly political,'' said the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, who complained to the commission that it never questioned him about police prosecutions, though it recommends that independent prosecutors investigate allegations of serious police misconduct -- which would undermine his authority. It was not reviewing prosecutorial practices, explained the commission.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berry characterized the dissent as ''mostly false and totally ideological.'' Mr. Redenbaugh, speaking over the phone, called the report ''blatantly political; the findings and recommendations don't proceed from the facts.''</p>
        <p>Maybe what the city needs is more facts. And the kind of objectivity even more rare in Washington than in City Hall.</p>
