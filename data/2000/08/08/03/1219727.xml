        <p>The leak in the ceiling had been there for weeks, a nasty bruise of moldy plaster and peeling paint. Though Anthony Spero had been trying his best to get a handyman in, there wasn't a guy in all of Staten Island who would take the job.</p>
        <p>''Nobody wants to come out here,'' Mr. Spero, the reputed consigliere or counselor of the Bonanno crime family, grumbled the other day as he glared at the ugly water stain. ''They gotta give their Social Security number, their date of birth and go through a background check. No repair guy I know is gonna want to go through that.''</p>
        <p>These are the domestic troubles of wise guys subjected to a new and remarkably restrictive form of house arrest. In the last two years, a handful of men accused of mob-related crimes have been freed on bail before their trials and forced to live with tapped phone lines, draconian visiting rights and round-the-clock surveillance as their private castles are turned into virtual jails.</p>
        <p>Though only a small number of people have borne the kind-of-in, kind-of-out existence that characterizes the home-as-jail, a judicial order issued in a Brooklyn court in June has made it tougher for mob defendants to be freed on bail, meaning that those who are released are more likely to wind up shuttered inside their homes.</p>
        <p>The cases have piqued the interest of prosecutors and defense lawyers, who naturally disagree on whether releasing a defendant from custody on the condition he convert his house into Sing Sing is fair and safe. And given that the defendants themselves must foot the bill for the harsh security measures, questions have also arisen about whether it is only the richest suspects who can pay the price of freedom by creating a prison atmosphere at home.</p>
        <p>The federal government has fought these so-called super-bail packages every time they have been offered. To let a suspected gangster out of custody before his trial, they say, is to invite jury tampering, witness intimidation -- or worse.</p>
        <p>''At bottom, these packages have an element of trust built into them because the guards can't watch these guys 24-7,'' said one law enforcement official who spoke on the condition that his name not be used. ''And if they're not watched round-the-clock, there's always the potential that they'll call their associates and continue committing crimes.''</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers, on the other hand, repudiate the notion that a man locked up inside his house with his phone lines tapped, his friends kept away and his movements watched by federal agents could manage to slip an illegal message to a crony or carry on with a criminal life.</p>
        <p>''The bail system itself has an element of trust built into it,'' said Gerald L. Shargel, Mr. Spero's lawyer, who is widely credited with devising the home-as-jail. ''Unless you put someone in a dungeon and chain them to a wall and put tape around their mouths, there's always the possibility of some kind of communication being sent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spero, 70, is to go on trial next month on charges that he ordered the deaths of four men while running what the government has called a particularly vicious Bonanno family crew. He posted $13.5 million in bail in May 1999 and for more than a year has been awaiting his day in court inside his pleasant house on Edgegrove Avenue with its airy parlor and cream-colored sofa set.</p>
        <p>It's a strange life, waking up in your own bedroom every morning but feeling as though you were still in jail, he said one afternoon last week. After all, video cameras are trained on every window and door. Armed guards must be present when his daughter stops by. There is a lovely pool in his small backyard, but he cannot use it. The electronic bracelet he wears beneath a tube sock on his ankle must not be submerged or removed.</p>
        <p>Then there are the family complications, mainly revolving around his live-in companion and her 26-year-old daughter, who also lives in the house but cannot have boyfriends over or talk on the telephone without sharing her innermost thoughts with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And, of course, there are the challenges presented by living in such close quarters with the private security guards who must accompany every guest.</p>
        <p>''We cook for the guards all the time,'' said Mr. Spero's companion, who asked that her name be withheld. ''One of them even gave me a great recipe for stuffed escarole the other day,'' she said, over a lunch of cheese cubes and turkey wraps.</p>
        <p>Not that it's all that easy, she added. ''The worst is when the agents come over to search the house at random. I'm always thinking, 'Oh God, are the beds made? Is everything clean?' I mean, you've got strangers walking through your home.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Spero was quick to insist that he is overjoyed to be out of jail. He gets to see his grandchildren. He gets to eat a sausage and pepper sandwich at any hour. He gets to sleep on a real bed, not some back-breaking cot.</p>
        <p>''And you can watch TV whenever you want when you're at home,'' he said as the Mets game blared from a nearby set. '' 'Cause when you're in jail, they're the ones that control the switch.''</p>
        <p>This version of house arrest is generally reserved for defendants charged with violent crimes or accused of having tampered with witnesses or juries in the past. Under federal law, defendants who apply for it must convince a judge of two things: that they pose no danger to their communities and that they will return to court on their appointed day.</p>
        <p>Most of the time, putting up a healthy sum of money will do the job, but, in a handful of recent cases, high-profile mobsters have had to subject themselves to considerably more.</p>
        <p>The first of these was John A. Gotti, the son of John J. Gotti, the imprisoned Gambino family boss. The younger Mr. Gotti was freed from jail in October 1998 after he secured his release with $10 million and oaths to wear an electronic bracelet that tracked his every move, to allow his phones to be monitored by the F.B.I. and to permit a full-time guard to be posted outside his home in Oyster Bay, N.Y.</p>
        <p>At the lengthy detention hearings in the case, federal prosecutors argued, among other things, that Mr. Gotti should not be released simply because he could afford the cost of his circumscribed freedom. Why, they asked, should a rich defendant be granted house arrest but a poor defendant be denied?</p>
        <p>Mr. Shargel, who represented Mr. Gotti in the case, countered that a defendant's pockets -- no matter how shallow or deep -- should never be used against him. If a poor man cannot afford to outfit his house like Rikers Island, he argued, it doesn't mean that a rich man should be penalized just because he can.</p>
        <p>The federal government has no centralized office that tracks defendants who ask for and are granted highly restricted house arrest, but, as it turns out, most do have vast resources. Some are like Chris Paciello, a wealthy Miami nightclub entrepreneur accused of robbery and murder, who is living under lock and key just miles from Mr. Spero's home. Others are like Carmine Agnello, the elder Mr. Gotti's son-in-law, who was charged with arson and extortion but was denied bail in June even though he offered to transform his $4 million Long Island home into a comfortable sort of jail.</p>
        <p>But the judge who rejected Mr. Agnello's application, Nina Gershon of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, does not like the idea that the rich can buy a more comfortable jail. She wrote in her order that suspects should not be free simply because they are ''able to pay the cost of extravagant release conditions.'' Yet legal experts say that it would be unconstitutional to deny bail automatically to every racketeering suspect. So the home-as-jail may be the only option for prosecutors looking to prevent a suspect from fleeing the country or committing more crimes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spero is spending a good deal of money on house arrest, his lawyers said, though nowhere near the $20,000 a month that the young Mr. Gotti paid. In fact, Mr. Spero hardly thinks about the money. He is wrapped up in more quotidian concerns.</p>
        <p>''I cleared it with the government that Anthony could take the garbage out,'' his companion said as she showed a visitor around the house. ''But he's always saying he can't do it. He's not allowed past the driveway. The electronic bracelet is to blame.''</p>
