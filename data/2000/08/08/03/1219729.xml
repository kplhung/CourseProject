        <p>A 25-year-old bus driver who lost control of his bus on 34th Street Tuesday night, seriously injuring a traffic enforcement agent and smashing into a building, told the police that he blacked out shortly after he pulled the bus away from a stop near Ninth Avenue, transit officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>But the officials said why he lost consciousness remained a mystery. Nothing in the driver's medical records indicated any diagnosis of a condition that could lead to blackouts or seizures, like diabetes, epilepsy or a heart condition.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing at all that raises any red flags,'' one transit official said, adding that the results of routine drug and alcohol tests performed on the driver Tuesday night would not be known for two or three days.</p>
        <p>The officials added that there were no reports of fumes in the bus that could have caused him to black out, though the bus is being closely inspected.</p>
        <p>The driver, Antonio Battista of Ozone Park, Queens, has been driving a city bus only since last May, and doctors found that he was in good health when he underwent a mandatory physical examination last year before getting the job, transit officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Battista and 34 passengers were hurt, though none of the injuries were life-threatening.</p>
        <p>Passengers said that in the accident, the driver slumped over the wheel, allowing his 19-ton bus to veer across two lanes of oncoming traffic and jump up onto the sidewalk just east of Ninth Avenue. It knocked down small trees and crushed a concrete planter before crashing into an office building at 333 West 34th Street.</p>
        <p>The traffic agent who was struck remained at Bellevue Hospital Center in stable condition yesterday and the driver was listed in stable condition at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Battista's traffic record shows no driving problems, except a minor infraction in 1997, in which he apparently disobeyed a green turn signal in Manhattan and was fined $15.</p>
        <p>A woman who answered the telephone at Mr. Battista's house in Ozone Park yesterday said that no one in his family wanted to comment about the incident and that she would not answer questions about whether Mr. Battista had had any recent medical problems.</p>
        <p>The incident recalled one on Fifth Avenue in 1997, in which a driver named Charles Alston had a seizure and lost control of his bus for seven blocks, killing a foot messenger and critically injuring a bicyclist. The next year, the State Public Transportation Safety Board said city transit officials had violated state law because they knew that Mr. Alston had a long history of seizures and alcoholism -- in addition to suffering from asthma and glaucoma -- but they failed to take him off the road. After the crash, a doctor who treated the driver said he probably had had  an epileptic seizure.</p>
        <p>Shortly after that accident, New York City Transit said it had started a program to monitor more aggressively those employees with illnesses or conditions that might impair their performance on the job.</p>
