        <p>Jeff Madrick (Economic Scene) examines efficient-market's hypothesis, which in 1970's was article of near-religious faith among economists but is being questioned by many who now say financial markets do not appear all that efficient after all; discusses findings by Harvard Prof Andrei Shleifer in book Inefficient Markets; hypothesis holds financial markets process all new information about securities so efficiently that no one can get consistent advantage over other investors; photo (M)</p>

        <p>BACK in the 1970's, the efficient-markets hypothesis was an article of near religious faith. As an economics student, I certainly bought the argument whole.

        <p>What the efficient-markets hypothesis principally meant was that you could not beat the market. Economists generally agreed that financial markets processed all new information about securities so efficiently that no one could get a consistent advantage over other investors.

        <p>BACK in the 1970's, the efficient-markets hypothesis was an article of near religious faith. As an economics student, I certainly bought the argument whole. ''There is no other proposition in economics which has more solid empirical evidence supporting it,'' Michael Jensen, a leading proponent of this school of thought, concluded in 1978.</p>
        <p>What the efficient-markets hypothesis principally meant was that you could not beat the market. Economists generally agreed that financial markets processed all new information about securities so efficiently that no one could get a consistent advantage over other investors. In other words, stock prices fairly reflected their true value most of the time. Better to buy an index fund that replicated the broad stock market averages like the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</p>
        <p>But economists are increasingly challenging the orthodoxy. A growing number argue that according to the best new evidence, financial markets do not appear all that efficient after all. My immediate reaction is to wonder how much my eminent professors cost me by convincing me that I could not outperform the averages. An investment of $5,000 in an index fund, earning about 10 percent a year since 1975, would have grown to $50,000 or so by now. But if I had invested with George Soros or Warren Buffett and earned maybe 30 percent a year (delusions of grandeur, I grant, but it serves as an example), that $5,000 would have run up to $3.5 million.</p>
        <p>In fact, if markets are not as efficient as once thought, there are more important consequences than my personal financial loss. Being less efficient suggests that speculative and dangerous stock market bubbles are entirely possible and even likely, that the federal authorities must remain vigilant about the complete and open flow of information, and that the stock market does not necessarily allocate capital investment to the right places.</p>
        <p>The best summary of the position is found in a new book, ''Inefficient Markets'' (Oxford University Press), by the Harvard professor Andrei Shleifer. Mr. Shleifer is no outsider to the economics establishment. He is the recent winner of the John Bates Clark award, given to an outstanding economist under 40. He was an influential proponent of the swift and highly debated introduction of free markets in Russia, known as shock therapy.</p>
        <p>Make no mistake about the efficient-markets hypothesis. As Mr. Shleifer makes clear, it is a powerful idea. Economists did not argue that all investors had to be rational for the market to work efficiently. Rather, they figured the mistakes of investors often offset one another. More important, even if investors pushed stocks out of line, there were enough well-informed investors who would sell the overvalued stocks and buy the undervalued ones. They would thus set stock prices right again -- and, through arbitrage techniques, they would take little risk in doing so.</p>
        <p>Probably the most important factor among evidence supporting the thesis is that adjusting for the amount of risk taken, economists showed that almost no professional money manager actually beat the market over time. If anyone did, it was considered pure luck -- like a gambler rolling seven 10 times in a row.</p>
        <p>Beginning in the 1980's, more sophisticated research found unsettling anomalies. For example, stocks that performed poorly in one period typically did better on average over time. If markets were truly efficient, well-informed investors should have sprung into immediate action and bought those poorly performing stocks well before anyone had a chance to make a big profit.</p>
        <p>It increasingly became clear, even to economists, that human behavior -- sometimes irrational -- affected stock prices. A long period of bad news could indeed induce investors to drive stocks to irrationally low prices, as happened in the 1970's. A long period of good news could induce them to buy at ever higher prices, creating a bubble.</p>
        <p>As for those well-informed investors who would correct stock prices, Mr. Shleifer argues that in real life, riskless arbitrage is virtually impossible in markets with thousands of securities.</p>
        <p>Evidence is persuasive that stocks often move whether or not their true value changes. For example, Mr. Shleifer notes, America Online rose by nearly 20 percent in late 1998 simply because it was announced that it would be included in the S.&amp; P. 500. This certainly did not reflect a change in the fundamental value of AOL.</p>
        <p>Not all economists have accepted this new heterodoxy. But a growing number have climbed aboard a wagon driven by a few brave pioneers, including Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago, Robert Shiller of Yale, Richard Roll of U.C.L.A. and now Mr. Shleifer. So if Mr. Shleifer and his mentors are right, there are opportunities to beat the averages. Maybe an investor like Mr. Soros, who often invested against the dominant psychological grain of the moment, was not just a lucky risk-taker after all.</p>
        <p>That the federal authorities should be more concerned with swings in the market means, in part, more diligent efforts to assure that all relevant information is made public. It means closer scrutiny of the books by federal investigators. It means strict accounting standards. Henry Kaufman, the former Salomon Brothers economist, is especially worried that the authorities are not vigilant enough these days.</p>
        <p>In my view, it also means that higher margin requirements and other credit restrictions on funds available for investment should be considered when markets reach dizzying heights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shleifer also says both evidence and theory suggest that many investors do poorly in the market over time because they chase the latest fashion. If so, he argues, we should think twice about encouraging plans to privatize Social Security, requiring average Americans to manage their own money.</p>
        <p>For those who wonder whether the academic skirmishes among economists really matter, here is a good example. An ideological attachment to market efficiency can lead to damaging conclusions about such diverse policies as Social Security privatization and federal oversight. The good news is that economists themselves are coming to the rescue.</p>
