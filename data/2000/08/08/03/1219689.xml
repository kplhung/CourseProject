        <p>The 30-year bond received a reprieve yesterday, and its fate is now probably in the hands of the next administration.</p>
        <p>In its announcement of the details of its quarterly auction of Treasury notes and bonds, the government did not put the 30-year bond, the onetime benchmark for Treasury interest rates, on the endangered species list, a development that surprised some investors.</p>
        <p>But some longtime bond market analysts, who have been reluctant to believe that a president and Congress could keep government surpluses running long enough to pay down most of the government's $3 trillion of publicly held debt, now think that the demise of the 30-year bond is nigh.</p>
        <p>It is now possible, said Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson &amp; Associates, to say that the public debt will shrink so much in the next few years that the only bonds that might be left will be those hoarded by investors unwilling to sell them back to the Treasury.</p>
        <p>The reason for this is the sheer size of the government surplus, which is now forecast to be $211 billion in the 2000 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, and $228 billion in the 2001 fiscal year.</p>
        <p>About a month ago, President Clinton announced that the projected surplus for the 2001 through 2010 fiscal years would be slightly less than $4.2 trillion. Of that, $2.3 trillion is expected to come from the Social Security system and the rest, almost $1.9 trillion, from general tax receipts. Both Democrats and Republicans consider the Social Security surplus off limits for tax cuts or spending programs. So that leaves $1.9 trillion to finance the tax cuts and spending increases that the two parties will fight over.</p>
        <p>What makes the demise of the 30-year bonds more plausible is that it is not practical to sell them when the publicly held debt could be eliminated in just more than a decade.</p>
        <p>So the pressure on the 30-year bond has been growing since last August, when the Treasury first announced it was considering buying back some of its longer-term debt and would reduce the amount of 30-year bonds it issued.</p>
        <p>The actual buybacks began early this year, and so far the Treasury has repurchased $17.5 billion of bonds with remaining maturities of 15 to 25 years. By the end of this year, the total should approach $30 billion, with two buybacks of $1 billion to $3 billion each month.</p>
        <p>And some investors apparently thought that the Clinton Treasury, in an effort to highlight its success in wiping out government deficits and starting to pay off the public debt, would have announced the next step for the 30-year bond yesterday. When they were disappointed, the price of the 30-year bond dropped a full point as its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 5.79 percent, from 5.72 percent on Tuesday. The bond rallied late in the day and finished down 18/32, to 106 30/32, with the yield at 5.76 percent. The 10-year note rose 2/32, to 103 26/32; its yield fell to 5.97 percent from 5.98 percent on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The announcement these investors were waiting for was that the Treasury would actively consider no longer issuing 30-year bonds, similar to the announcement it made in May about one-year bills.</p>
        <p>Gary Gensler, the under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, said there was no need for any significant change either in the Treasury's reduced pace of issuing new Treasury bills, notes and bonds, or in its plan for buying back existing debt. He said the reason was the large amount of government debt that the Treasury had paid off so far -- $360 billion over three years -- and the fact that the amount of maturing Treasury debt was still high next year, $464 billion, and the year after, $382 billion.</p>
        <p>One small change announced was that the Treasury would now include callable Treasury securities in its buyback program. A callable security can be repurchased on demand by the Treasury at a certain date before its maturity. The Treasury also said it would buy back securities with remaining maturities of 10 years or more.</p>
        <p>With the 30-year bond down to new issuance of just $15 billion a year -- $5 billion of that next week -- a decision on its fate cannot be far.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gensler, however, said yesterday that it was Treasury policy ''to give the market ample notice should we decide to eliminate or curtail a particular issue.''</p>
        <p>We will continue to follow that practice,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So it is likely that the next administration will decide the fate of the 30-year bond. The current one has one more chance, at the next quarterly news conference announcing Treasury intentions, on Nov. 1, the Wednesday before Election Day.</p>
