        <p>Just days after the New York State Supreme Court blocked the demolition of Judson House, a Greek Revival town house at Third and Thompson Streets in Greenwich Village that was home to some of the most experimental dance work of the 1960's, a newer troupe is honoring its legacy. Beginning tonight, the White Oak Dance Project, under the direction of Mikhail Baryshnikov, will wrap up its residency at the McCarter Theater in Princeton with four performances of its latest undertaking, ''Past Forward,'' featuring reconstructed and new works by Judson Dance Theater choreographers like Yvonne Rainer, David Gordon and Trisha Brown. Mr. Baryshnikov will dance, and narrate ''Past Forward.''</p>

        <p>High Notes</p>
        <p>What becomes a legend most? If you're Van Cliburn, the answer most certainly has to be Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto in B flat minor, the work that sent his star soaring in 1958, when he won the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, got a ticker-tape parade in New York and sold more than a million copies of his LP recording. On Friday, the pianist, who, though no recluse, has managed to whittle down his concert performances from more than a hundred to a dozen or so a year, will give a rare performance of his signature piece with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, led by Seiji Ozawa, at Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass. Mr. Cliburn turned 66 in June.</p>
        <p>A Merry Mess</p>
        <p>The Hamptons Shakespeare Festival has plunged into its summer season with a new staging of ''Much Ado About Nothing.'' Now in previews, it opens on Saturday and runs through Aug. 20 at Theodore Roosevelt County Park on Route 27, three miles east of Montauk. All performances begin at 7:30 p.m., with a suggested donation of $10. Information: (631) 267-0105 or at the festival Web site, www.hamptons-shakespeare.org.</p>
        <p>People's Choice</p>
        <p>As for Shakespeare in another setting, the Gorilla Repertory Theater Company is at work fulfilling its mission to ''bring theater to people where they are'' with its traditional summer presentation of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Set in Washington Square Park, the ethereal romance, which opens tonight, will run in repertory with another comedic favorite, ''As You Like It.'' Not to be outdone, the company is also taking its production of Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta ''The Pirates of Penzance'' on board the Peking, a three-mast ship docked at the South Street Seaport, starting Friday. Tickets are $15. Information: (212) 330-8086 or www.gorillatickets.com.</p>
