        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Ford Said to Plan Improved Mileage in Sport Utilities'' (front page, July 27), you report that ''lighter auto parts are usually more expensive, because they need to be made from aluminum instead of steel.''</p>
        <p>Over the last six years, the global steel industry has demonstrated the untapped potential of steel to reduce the weight of auto components at no cost premium through its series of ''ultralight steel auto body'' initiatives. Ford and other vehicle makers have been increasing their use of advanced high-strength steels and processing technologies to save weight, improve performance and safety, and reduce cost.</p>
