        <p>Showy Matron</p>
        <p>Q. At a nursery, while looking for fall-blooming plants to mix into my garden, I found Sedum Matrona, a purple-foliage sedum I have never seen before. Can you give me any information about it?</p>
        <p>A. Sedum Matrona is a relatively new hybrid between S. telephium subsp. maximum Atropurpureum and S. spectabile, and it is spectacular. Both parents are winners of the Royal Horticulture Society's Award of Garden Merit, and Matrona, bred in 1990 in Germany, has been declared Hardy Perennial Plant of the Year for 2000 in several European countries. It is also popular in garden centers in the United States, because it combines so well with other late-blooming perennials and shorter ornamental grasses. If they are sold out, think about your fall garden earlier next year. If Sedum Matrona becomes Perennial Plant of the Year in this country, it will sell like a new Harry Potter book.</p>

        <p>Showy Matron</p>
        <p>Q. At a nursery, while looking for fall-blooming plants to mix into my garden, I found Sedum Matrona, a purple-foliage sedum I have never seen before. Can you give me any information about it?</p>
        <p>A. Sedum Matrona is a relatively new hybrid between S. telephium subsp. maximum Atropurpureum and S. spectabile, and it is spectacular. Both parents are winners of the Royal Horticulture Society's Award of Garden Merit, and Matrona, bred in 1990 in Germany, has been declared Hardy Perennial Plant of the Year for 2000 in several European countries. It is also popular in garden centers in the United States, because it combines so well with other late-blooming perennials and shorter ornamental grasses. If they are sold out, think about your fall garden earlier next year. If Sedum Matrona becomes Perennial Plant of the Year in this country, it will sell like a new Harry Potter book.</p>
        <p>Taller than other sedums at 20 to 24 inches, its thick, sturdy dark red stems keep it matronly upright and show off the large heads of delicate pink flowers with darker pink stamens. The eye-catching contrast between the flowers and the fleshy, succulent purple-veined and purple-tinged leaves works much better in person than it sounds in words.</p>
        <p>The umbrella-shaped flowers turn bronzy as the weather gets colder. Even dry, they retain their garden interest into winter. Like other sedums, Matrona prefers full sun and average, well-drained soil and a prominent place to show off.</p>
        <p>Columbine Collector</p>
        <p>Q. The seed heads on my white columbines have browned. Before they open and scatter, I would like to gather the seeds. Since the seeds are ready to go, it seems as if this is the right time to plant, but I wonder if they can be held until spring?</p>
        <p>A. When the slender seed heads split open, the small shiny-black seeds are ready. You needn't stand around waiting for them because the seed heads are held upright, so the seeds don't all fall out when the head opens. Instead, the seeds scatter a few at a time whenever the wind blows. By tipping the heads into an envelope, you'll capture nearly all of them.</p>
        <p>As to when to plant, your options are limited. Robert Bartholomei, director of outdoor gardens at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, said columbine (Aquilegia) requires stratification, which breaks down inhibitors to germination. While many seeds that need stratification can be kept slightly damp in a refrigerator for a month or two, columbine seems to need a changing environment, alternating cooling and warming.</p>
        <p>Nature is the best stratifier. Plant them now or later in the fall; either way, they won't germinate until next spring. Lightly scratch up the soil, scatter the seeds and just barely cover them. Have a drink to their health and wait for spring.</p>
        <p>Columbines are easy to transplant when they have two to three sets of leaves, but not when they are mature plants. So if you want to move them around in the garden, or give a few away, do it while they're young. Saving columbine seeds to start new plants is a good idea because the plants tend to be short-lived, dying out after three or four years.</p>
        <p>Will you get that beautiful white columbine back? Most likely. Normally, they are notorious for cross-pollinating with any other neighborhood columbines in bloom, and the offspring is unpredictable. But white columbines are almost guaranteed to be a cultivar of A. flabellata, which blooms earlier than other columbines. Pollination without competition is the ideal way to ensure that seedlings will look like their parents.</p>
