        <p>IN a critical report released last year, the Center for Science in the Public Interest referred to soft drinks as ''liquid candy.'' Now there's a minitrend toward producing what might be called solid soft drinks.</p>
        <p>A case in point is Snapple Beverages, a unit of the Triarc Companies, which is introducing a line of Snapple candy this fall. The concept came from two entrepreneurs who thought the unusual Snapple flavors -- like Peach Tea, Mango Madness and Pink Lemonade -- might translate well into candy.</p>
        <p>''We thought the image of Snapple, which was fun and quirky and innovative and different, lent itself to the industry,'' said Scott Semel, who founded Cody Kramer Imports, based in Blauvelt, N.Y., with Reid Chase. ''Most candy licenses are event-driven or character-driven, and not brand-driven. We solicited three or four brands with our idea, and Snapple was our first choice because it made the most sense.''</p>
        <p>Other companies are pursuing similar paths. Jelly Belly jelly beans makes three flavors derived from soft drinks: Dr Pepper, A &amp; W root beer and A &amp; W cream soda. All three brands are owned by Cadbury Schweppes. ''It is a wave of the future,'' said Susan Fussell, a spokeswoman for the National Confectioners Association. Other examples include Hi-C fruit chews, made by Brach Confections, and Sunkist fruit chews, which are produced by the Ben Myerson Candy Company, she said.</p>
        <p>Both the soft drink industry and the candy industry have experienced flat to little growth over the last several years, and more manufacturers are trying to increase their sales in convenience stores, so cross-marketing may have special appeal. On the other hand, candy brands have been crossing over for some time to other food categories; Snickers became an ice cream confection several years ago, and other Mars brands turn up as ingredients in McDonald's desserts and other ice cream concepts.</p>
        <p>Cody Kramer approached Triarc last June and fairly quickly obtained a licensing agreement. The companies would not disclose the terms, but, typically, brand owners receive a percentage of sales from licensing their names.</p>
        <p>The candy has evolved into several forms. Snapplets are hard candies packaged in Lifesavers-style rolls, as well as in bags. Then there are Snapple Beans, which closely resemble jelly beans, and Snapple Fruits, which are reminiscent of Gummi bears. A fourth product, Snapple Whirls, is also similar to Gummi bears.</p>
        <p>The benefits are abundant, both for the licensee and the brand owner, Mr. Semel said. ''It raises brand awareness in places where it hasn't been,'' he said. ''You could be checking out of a grocery store and see a Snapplet roll at the counter, and it will visually enhance the brand in your mind. There's an intangible value to that.''</p>
        <p>Then there's the object-permanence factor. ''You drink a drink and it's gone in 30 seconds,'' Mr. Chase said. ''But a bag of candy is going to stay with you. You'll have it in your house or on your desk, and it's going to be in front of you for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Cody Kramer began as an importer of Lindt chocolate, pastilles and other luxury products. It then ventured into private-label candy, producing tins of hard candy for clients like Old Navy and Williams Sonoma. But those categories represented the fringes of the candy business, and the founders wanted to find a third area to develop.</p>
        <p>''That's when the idea of licensing came into our heads,'' Mr. Semel said. Other brands he wanted, but didn't get, include Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade Inc., the Vermont ice cream company that was acquired by Unilever P.L.C. earlier this year for $326 million. Efforts to license brands like Cherry Garcia and Chunky Monkey went nowhere, Mr. Semel said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, ''Snapple has been tremendous to work with,'' Mr. Chase said. ''They are constantly coming up with ideas for promotions, how we can work with their beverage distribution. A pizza parlor may have a Snapple machine, but there is not typically candy in there.''</p>
        <p>He and Mr. Semel expect their company's sales to grow to $40 million next year, up from $22 million this year, with about $12 million to $15 million of next year's sales coming from Snapple candy.</p>
        <p>''It's a great idea,'' said Ms. Fussell, the spokeswoman of the confectioners group. ''It combines two things that are already popular, candy and beverages.''</p>
