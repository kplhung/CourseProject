        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak took another battering today in the wake of the Camp David summit meeting when his foreign minister resigned over Mr. Barak's willingness to compromise with the Palestinians on Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>The prime minister also faced four separate bills in the Knesset, or Parliament, calling for new elections that passed by the same number of votes that would be needed to topple his government in a no-confidence vote. The bills had no immediate impact, but they served to further embolden the opposition.</p>
        <p>The resignation of Foreign Minister David Levy was not unexpected. He had threatened to quit today if Mr. Barak did not bring the right into a national unity government. And Mr. Levy, who is known for his keen sense of which way the prevailing political winds are blowing, had switched sides before when he resigned as foreign minister from the cabinet of Mr. Barak's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, once a commando used to operating alone in enemy territory, appeared unfazed, even cocky in the face of his latest challenges, moving with a bouncy step and tight smile through the tumult in the Parliament. At one point, he sat next to Mr. Levy -- who had just resigned with a fiery speech -- clapped him on the back and shook his hand.</p>
        <p>With the Parliament now in recess for its three-month vacation, Mr. Barak and his dwindling supporters hope to reach some kind of an agreement with the Palestinians, and possibly then go to new elections on the prime minister's own terms, with the elections serving as a kind of referendum on the peace effort.</p>
        <p>''In a few more weeks the dust will settle,'' Mr. Barak said. ''We may have three months to try and consolidate either the peace negotiations or the government, and this may be the 90 days of the most important period in the present Israeli agenda.''</p>
        <p>''We will be able to broaden the base of the government and continue into the future to achieve our objective,'' said Mr. Barak, with apparent confidence.</p>
        <p>Yossi Sarid, a longtime peace advocate and chairman of the 10-seat Meretz party, which has supported Mr. Barak's government, added: ''We have to gain time now, that is the recipe. We have to gain a few months in order to gain something much more important, because time won't do its part if we don't do ours. The time will allow the achievement of an agreement with the Palestinians, and this is possible.''</p>
        <p>But Limor Livnat, a stalwart of the right-wing Likud, shouted scornfully, ''Don't try to pull any fast ones while the Knesset is on recess.''</p>
        <p>The leader of the conservative Likud party, Ariel Sharon, warned on Tuesday that what he called his ''Jerusalem Coalition'' would ''stand on guard,'' ready to call Parliament back into session if any agreement threatening Israeli sovereignty over all of Jerusalem appeared likely.</p>
        <p>Before his resignation today there had been signs that Mr. Levy was seeking to return to his old home in Likud. During the Camp David meeting, while he was acting prime minister in Mr. Barak's absence, Mr. Levy made a sympathetic visit to hunger-striking settlers outside the prime minister's residence.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Levy spoke of the ''grave situation'' that had developed because of the introduction of the once-taboo subject of Jerusalem at Camp David. ''These things touch upon the soul of the people,'' he said. ''It turns out that we are talking about the very heart of ancient Jerusalem. We are talking about things that the vast majority of the people are connected in their soul, their past, present and future.''</p>
        <p>''I can say that the fact of an announcement that we would get access to the Western Wall takes us backward to the time before the establishment of the Jewish state,'' Mr. Levy added. ''Regarding the Temple Mount, the Holy of Holies, they refused to understand the connection of the Jewish people to the Holy of Holies. That is a denial of our past in this land.''</p>
        <p>In all, five bills were introduced today calling for dissolution of the Parliament and new elections. But because they will be referred to a committee controlled by Mr. Barak, the measures can be bottled up and will produce no immediate effect.</p>
        <p>The first bill, introduced by Likud's Silvan Shalom -- who said, ''the 'prime minister of the people' has become the prime minister of one man -- Ehud Barak'' -- received 61 votes in favor, 51 opposed and 6 abstentions. Three similar bills each received the same totals, and as some members drifted away a final bill received 60 in favor, 47 opposed and 6 abstentions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak reportedly criticized his colleagues in the One Israel party during a meeting this afternoon for not putting up a decent fight, saying they were coming across as whining and defeatist. Their problems did not reflect a state of total collapse, he said, adding the faint-hearted should step aside.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Parliament Speaker Avraham Burg -- a potential rival -- warned Mr. Barak that he was keeping too many decisions to himself and would stand alone if he did not take other Labor Party leaders into his confidence.</p>
        <p>In the immediate speculation over who would be named foreign minister, the public security minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, figured prominently because the dovish history professor has been a senior negotiator in the peace talks and meets frequently with Palestinian security officials. There was also talk of Mr. Sarid, the Meretz party chairman, but he is said to want to regain the Education Ministry post he resigned in the vain hope of keeping the Shas Party, with its crucial 17 seats, in Mr. Barak's coalition. Shas quit the government on the eve of the Camp David meeting.</p>
        <p>The problems Mr. Barak has had in contending with recently changed election procedures, which have resulted in a fragmented Parliament of small parties that pursue their own interests, were on full display again today.</p>
        <p>The five ultra-orthodox members from the United Torah Judaism party were clumped in the back of the chamber not taking part in the vote, saying they were under orders from their spiritual leader, Rabbi Shalom Yosef Elyashiv, to abstain.</p>
        <p>Shouting Likud members descended on them and threatened that if they did abstain Likud would vote against a bill they have sponsored granting additional government benefits to large families. The five votes were duly cast against Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>The parliamentary sessions have become so emotional that Mr. Burg, in his summing up of the summer session, expressed concern that the tension might lead to fisticuffs on the floor.</p>
        <p>''If there is a prayer in my heart, it is that I won't be the first Knesset speaker in whose term of office there was violence in the Knesset,'' he said.</p>
