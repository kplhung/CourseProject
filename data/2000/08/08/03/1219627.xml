        <p>Most window boxes span one window. I-Beam, a Manhattan design firm, has an indoor window box that runs 41 feet beneath 11 windows. In the fall it is planted with sod, above. (Who mows it?) In summer, it holds basil, petunias and impatiens. Suzan Wines and Azin Valy, the partners in the firm, set up their office in a 500-square-foot loft on West 29th Street in 1998 and discovered that the space was so bright they could garden indoors. Ms. Valy designed the planter box (actually 10 contiguous boxes) and wood cabinets, which hide radiators and provide storage. The plexiglass planter boxes are 4 1/2 inches deep and extend 16 inches into the room. The cost for the cabinets, planter boxes, soil and seeds was around $4,300. Growing basil for pesto costs almost nothing.</p>
