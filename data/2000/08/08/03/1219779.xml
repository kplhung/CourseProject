        <p>Two days after announcing disappointing quarterly financial results, the Computer Sciences Corporation said yesterday that it had won a $3 billion contract to provide technology services to Nortel Networks of Canada for the next seven years. Nortel, North America's second-biggest maker of telecommunications equipment after Lucent Technologies, will essentially turn over responsibility for its internal computer systems to Computer Sciences, which will manage computers on more than 75,000 desktops worldwide for Nortel.</p>
