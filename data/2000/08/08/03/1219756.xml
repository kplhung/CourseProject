        <p>It is all so murky, the rhetoric here, that you might think yourself back in the presidential campaign of 1952, when Dwight D. Eisenhower promised, ''I shall go to Korea,'' but supplied no details about what he would do to end the war once he got there.</p>

        <p>It is all so murky, the rhetoric here, that you might think yourself back in the presidential campaign of 1952, when Dwight D. Eisenhower promised, ''I shall go to Korea,'' but supplied no details about what he would do to end the war once he got there.</p>
        <p>Or maybe 1968 or 1972, in the heyday of Richard M. Nixon, another campaigner often short on specifics. Confident that he was well ahead of Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968, he told the nation he would end the war in Vietnam, but he never bothered to say what he had in mind. Four years later, more confident, he stayed off the stump, running the first Rose Garden campaign.</p>
        <p>This year, en route to nomination for president, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has hammered the Clinton administration's foreign policy, suggesting that it has been inept, ill-focused and lacking in priorities.</p>
        <p>In a speech in Washington on May 23, he said that ''the world has changed faster than United States policy'' and called for a fresh approach to nuclear weapons and a more comprehensive missile defense system. At other times he has hinted he would spend less energy on humanitarian missions and more on dealing with great powers like China and Russia and on shoring up America's alliances.</p>
        <p>But the first three nights of a Republican convention that Mr. Bush had promised would lay new ideas before the American people, including a night designated as an occasion to discuss national security, produced few details of what a Bush administration might do overseas.  The speeches have been vague even by the lax standards of convention oratory, an art form that was tailor-made for bloviation.</p>
        <p>Most of what has been said dealt with Mr. Bush's personal qualities, not with policy -- grist for People magazine, not Foreign Affairs.</p>
        <p>''No specifics, no nuance,'' said the historian Michael Beschloss. ''I think the lack of content may be unprecedented. They argue that Bill Clinton paid less attention to foreign policy than any president since Herbert Hoover, which may be fair. But they have given no example here of how they would lead or where they would go.''</p>
        <p>It may be that Mr. Bush himself will fill in the gaps when he appears before the convention on Thursday night. But if so, he will change the pattern that has emerged this week.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Colin L. Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff during the war in the Persian Gulf, talked almost exclusively about domestic affairs, including the ills afflicting urban areas, the need to pay more attention to the education of the nation's children and the problems of minorities. Only at the end did he look overseas, assuring the delegates that Mr. Bush ''will not repeat the mistakes of the past and let our insurance policy, our armed forces, fall into disrepair.''</p>
        <p>Tuesday's speeches consisted mostly of similar generalizations.</p>
        <p>Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded American troops in the Middle East during the war, said that American military strength had withered since then. But he gave no prescription for rebuilding it, except to voice a wish for ''another commander in chief named George Bush with Dick Cheney on his team.'' Mr. Cheney, nominated tonight as Mr. Bush's running mate, served as defense secretary during the war.</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain of Arizona, whom Mr. Bush defeated for the nomination, said that Mr. Bush ''knows well that there is no safe alternative to American leadership, and he will not squander this unique moment in history by allowing America to retreat behind empty threats, false promises and uncertain diplomacy'' -- an indirect indictment of Mr. Clinton, presumably, but one unaccompanied by even shadowy proposals for policy initiatives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's main foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was only slightly more forthcoming. She said that Mr. Bush would not regard the American military as ''a global police force'' without a clue as to where and under what circumstances troops should be used; she promised that Mr. Bush would move at the earliest possible date to institute ''the deployment of effective missile defenses,'' without saying when that might be, and asserted that Mr. Bush ''recognizes the challenge the Chinese government poses to our interests and values,'' without outlining how that challenge might be met.</p>
        <p>Much of what she said sounded like cheerleading, as when she praised Mr. Bush -- ''the George W. Bush that I know'' -- as a man of ''uncommonly good judgment'' who is ''focused and consistent'' and knows ''that we Americans are at our best when we exercise power without fanfare and arrogance.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, Mr. Cheney joined in the chorus, praising Mr. Bush in his advance text as ''a man who has the courage and the vision and the goodness to be a great president.'' Big changes, he said, are coming to Washington, following eight years of ''squandered opportunities.'' He did not name them.</p>
        <p>Aside from promising, like almost everyone, to devote more resources to the military, Mr. Cheney concentrated on life at home. He talked about education and Social Security and working with Democrats to end the air ''of bitterness and ill will and partisan strife'' in Washington, but not about Europe or Asia.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Clinton eight years ago, Mr. Bush began the campaign with an inconvenient dearth of foreign policy experience. Like Mr. Clinton, and unlike Vice President Al Gore, his Democratic rival, he has no service in Vietnam to dwell upon with pride.</p>
        <p>Early on, Mr. Bush surrounded himself with an impressive array of national security experts, most of them veterans of past Republican administrations, including Ms. Rice, Paul Wolfowitz, Robert Zoellick and Richard Perle. (The notable exception is James A. Baker, one of his father's secretaries of state, whose performance in his father's unsuccessful 1992 campaign the younger Mr. Bush has often faulted).</p>
        <p>In a ''coming-out'' speech at the Ronald Reagan Library near Los Angeles on Nov. 19, George W. Bush won good marks for what most experts considered a polished performance. His choice of Mr. Cheney lent the ticket further heft on foreign policy.</p>
        <p>But there remains a long list of issues on which the delegates, and those across the country following the convention in the news media, have so far heard little. Among them are strategies for dealing with the intractable problems of Russia and China, the issue of expanding NATO farther into Eastern Europe, the manifold complications of expanding free world trade and the doubts that surround the present requirement that the Pentagon be prepared to fight simultaneous wars in two different theaters of war.</p>
        <p>There are divisions within the Republican party on issues like Kosovo that have yet to be resolved.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush leaves too much unspoken for too long, he may hand Mr. Gore a significant opening. Mr. Gore, after all, has had broad experience in foreign policy matters, first on Capitol Hill, then in the White House. And while the Clinton administration has had its flops overseas, in places like Africa and Haiti, it has also recorded significant achievements, particularly in peace efforts in Northern Ireland and the Middle East.</p>
        <p>But then, Mr. Bush may have decided that too much talk about foreign policy is bad business. He has talked often to friends and acquaintances about his father's loss to Bill Clinton eight years ago, when the elder Bush focused on foreign affairs and the Arkansas neophyte emphasized the economy.</p>
