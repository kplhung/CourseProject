        <p>CHILDREN have always come in a wide range of sizes. And finally, their desks and chairs do, too. With the proliferation of computers for games and homework, children's rooms are beginning to look like miniature home offices. Like adults, children need properly proportioned desks and chairs for comfort and safe posture. Elbows should stay at waist height when the child uses a keyboard. The monitor should be at eye level. Feet should be flat on the floor. The furniture here is adjustable in small increments so it can grow along with its users.</p>

        <p>CHILDREN have always come in a wide range of sizes. And finally, their desks and chairs do, too. With the proliferation of computers for games and homework, children's rooms are beginning to look like miniature home offices. Like adults, children need properly proportioned desks and chairs for comfort and safe posture. Elbows should stay at waist height when the child uses a keyboard. The monitor should be at eye level. Feet should be flat on the floor. The furniture here is adjustable in small increments so it can grow along with its users.</p>
        <p>1. The z1 computer desk by Skools is a complete workstation made of molded plywood. The 37-by-28-inch desktop accommodates a computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse and printer and comes with a built-in surge protector, storage shelf and cutouts for electric wires. The height of the work surface adjusts from 14 to 30 inches in two-inch increments. The unit, on lockable casters, is shipped fully assembled; $875. The molded wood chair, $150, available in 12- or 14-inch seat heights, does not adjust. Available from www.kinderlink.com or (800) 545-4474.</p>
        <p>2. The work surface height of the iCart by Anthro is adjustable in one-inch increments and will hold PC's as well as Macs. The metal tubular frame, on locking casters, comes in dozens of colors, including the iMac hues -- lime, grape, tangerine, strawberry, blueberry and silver. The tall cart (shown) has a top shelf for a printer or storage and costs $199. (An adjustable keyboard tray is another $100.) Other accessories (document holder, cup holder, more shelves) are also available. From www.proergo.com or (888) 374-6776. The iChair for children adjusts just as an adult ergonomic office chair and comes in vinyl or fabric. Colors include all the iMac shades. Wheels are included; $169 for the smallest chair (kindergarten through sixth grade), $189 for middle-school size and $209 for high-school size. Also from www.proergo.com.</p>
        <p>3. A wood and plastic workstation ($360) designed by the New York architect Roberto Gil has an adjustable work surface, a lower shelf for peripherals and wires, a monitor stand and a hutch-style storage unit. The adjustable chair ($130) is on casters and comes with a storage shelf. From www.momastore.org or (800) 793-3167.</p>
        <p>4. A computer desk by Kidstation in bright washable laminate fits most PC's, Macs and video game units. Both the seat and the seat back of the companion chair are adjustable, and the height of the work surface goes from 12 inches, for very young children, up to 22 3/8 inches. The set is recommended for children 3 to 8 and costs $179 from www.kidstation.com or (800) 397-9055.</p>
        <p>5. A light-gray laminate computer workstation, 43 inches wide by 20 1/2 inches deep, has a pullout keyboard tray. The legs are adjustable from 18 to 22 inches; $200. The adjustable wood chair  costs $29. From Tuffyland Products, www.tuffyland.com or (800) 245-7224.</p>
