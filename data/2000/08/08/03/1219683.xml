        <p>Alvin R. Tresselt, a children's book author who won praise for describing and explaining nature to the young, died on July 24 at his home in Burlington, Vt. He was 83.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tresselt's books had sold over a million copies, the multivolume reference work ''Contemporary Authors'' reported in 1980. By that time, it noted, he was the sole author of more than 30 children's books and had written a score of book-length adaptations of folk tales.</p>
        <p>His book ''The Dead Tree'' (1972), for children ages 4 to 8, was named an American Library Association Notable Book and won the Irma Simonton Black Award of the Bank Street College of Education. That work was called a classic by Publishers Weekly. King Feature Syndicate described it as ''an informative book that shows how the animals, birds and forests thrive because of the natural cycle of a dead tree.'' It was reissued in 1992 with a new title, ''The Gift of the Tree'' (Lothrop).</p>
        <p>Mr. Tresselt's book ''White Snow Bright Snow'' (Lothrop, 1948), with illustrations by Roger Duvoisin, was written for children ages 3 to 6. It ''captures the excitement and ever-recurring wonder which all children feel as the first flakes fall and the world takes on a softer shape and new colors,'' The New York Times Book Review said. The work won the American Library Association's Caldecott Medal for excellence in children's book illustration in 1948.</p>
        <p>Another early Tresselt-Duvoisin collaboration, ''Sun Up'' (1949), for ages 4 to 8, was praised in The Times Book Review for creating ''an evocative impression of the changing moods of wind and weather.''</p>
        <p>Reissued in 1991, with new illustrations by Henri Sorensen, the book was lauded by Smithsonian magazine as a ''lyrical account of one day on a family farm, accompanied by watercolors steeped in sun and shadow'' and ''certainly one of the year's most beautiful offerings.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tresselt was born in Passaic, N.J., graduated from high school there, worked in other fields and began writing children's books in the 1940's.</p>
        <p>He was for a time the editor of Humpty Dumpty's Magazine, a children's publication, and executive editor and vice president from 1967 to 1974 of Parents' Magazine Press, where he was head editor of its children's books.</p>
        <p>Surviving are his wife, Blossom Budney Tresselt, also a children's book writer; two daughters, Ellen Victoria Tresselt of Danbury, Conn., and India Rachel Tresselt of Westford, Vt.; and two grandsons.</p>
