        <p>Shares in Global Crossing Ltd. soared more than 12 percent yesterday after it said its second-quarter cash flow exceeded expectations. Although the company's $365.4 million quarterly loss was also larger than expected, Global Crossing added $2.5625, to $27.875, in trading yesterday. Cash flow at Global Crossing, which is based in Hamilton, Bermuda, was $1.415 billion, compared with the $1.295 billion forecast. Global Crossing's chief executive, Leo J. Hindery Jr. told analysts that the company now views its previous estimates of cash flow and sales for 2000 as ''understated'' as it presses forward with plans to make nearly all of its fiber optic cable systems around the world operational by next year.</p>
