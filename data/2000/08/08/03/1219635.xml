        <p>MacIntosh users may have easier time in a Windows world now that Microsoft has spun off a unit to create Mac software from ground up, instead of merely recycling old Windows code into Mac versions of its programs (State of the Art column) (M)</p>

        <p>IT'S never easy living as a Mac user in a Windows world, but it is a lot easier than it used to be. Microsoft, maker of Windows, was once thought to be Apple's greatest enemy. I will admit to referring to Microsoft as ''the Borg'' (taken from the dominating alien race on ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'') in those dark days of '97 when Apple's future looked shaky. But then things got better.</p>
        <p>Instead of trying to squash the Mac, Microsoft has actually spun off a unit to create Mac software from the ground up, instead of merely recycling old Windows code into Mac versions of its programs. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.5 browser for the Mac featured many technogoodies, like a page-print preview option, that were not included in the concurrent Windows versions, and Internet Explorer 5 for Mac has even more.</p>
        <p>The Mac version of Microsoft's Office suite, which includes the Word 98 word-processing program, Excel 98 for spreadsheets and the PowerPoint 98 presentation program, also had features that didn't appear on the other platform until the release of Office 2000 for Windows. At the Macworld exhibition in New York last month, I saw a demonstration of Microsoft's Office 2001 for Macintosh, which featured some enticing additions like Entourage, an e-mail and personal-information manager that can be fully integrated with current Office programs and can synchronize with Palm organizers.</p>
        <p>Toolbars and icons within the Office suite have been redesigned to make them more intuitive and Mac-like, and QuickTime movie clips can be easily incorporated into PowerPoint presentations. Microsoft Office 2001, available only for Macs, is due in October. More information is available at www.microsoft  .com/mac.</p>
        <p>Computers are all about communication in one form or another, and having your Mac files be compatible with Windows files from the ubiquitous Office suite is often a real concern among those of us in Clan Macintosh. Microsoft promises that Office 2001 will sustain ''seamless compatibility'' with Windows Office 2000, which means that a Mac user can write a memo in Word 2001 and send it as an e-mail attachment to a Windows user running Word 2000 and magical things will happen -- the file will open with no problems and all the formatting will be intact. The Save As dialogue box in Word 2001 will even let Mac users save their files with a three-letter Windows file extension appended to it, making things move even more smoothly between the two systems.</p>
        <p>Not every document I get has been sent in a Windows Office format -- some are in WordPerfect by Corel or the AppleWorks software, and I also receive graphics, spreadsheet and database files that are not Mac-friendly. I usually run those types of hard-to-open files through my copy of MacLink Plus, by DataViz (www  .dataviz.com). That little $99 lifesaver will convert just about any text, graphics or spreadsheet file into something my Mac can read. It will also convert my own files into formats that a Windows user can probably handle.</p>
        <p>Third-party software like MacLink Plus is designed to bridge the gap between the two systems. But helpful  software is sometimes right there in the Mac operating system. Mac users have been able to read and use PC-formatted floppy disks on their machines for years, thanks to the system's PC Exchange utility, even if they have to buy an external floppy drive to do so.</p>
        <p>The small size of my New York apartment will not allow me to indulge my dream of having several computers scattered around, all running different operating systems. For those times when I absolutely have to use Windows at home (for, say, one of those genealogy programs that come with what seems like 47 CD-ROM's, all of them Windows only), I resort to Virtual PC 3.0 from the Connectix Corporation (www.connectix.com).</p>
        <p>Virtual PC, which will emulate a Windows system on your Mac and let you run Windows-only software, is for users willing to part with roughly $180 and more than 500 megabytes of hard drive space to store the program. It runs more slowly than a real Windows system, but you can configure the settings to make your Mac's ports function like those on a PC running Windows.</p>
        <p>You can drag and drop graphics and files from the Mac desktop onto the Virtual PC faux-Windows desktop and open them. The program also lets a Mac user surf the Web and get e-mail while in Windows mode without bothering with dial-up or network settings. Virtual PC comes in five  versions: Windows 95, 98 and 2000; PC-DOS; and Red Hat Linux for the  especially adventurous.</p>
        <p>For current news, reviews and Mac-related information, I regularly check the MacInTouch (www  .macintouch.com) and Mac Observer (www.macobserver.com) Web sites. For example, the Mac Observer recently reported that 3dfx, a maker of powerful graphics cards for PC gamers, had released its first made-for-the-Mac add-in card. Fans of game-playing on the Mac will probably be cheered by this news, as well as by the fact that Blizzard Entertainment just released the Mac version of its popular game Diablo II (www.blizzard.com), less than a month after the PC version's debut. For Mac gamers, that's progress.</p>
        <p>Recognizing the demand for software, other companies that produce Windows software are beginning to release the Mac versions around the same time. Grolier Interactive (www.grolier.com), which makes the robust Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia reference suite on CD-ROM,  plans to release the 2001 Mac version of the suite just a week or so after the Windows version hits the shelves in early September. And some companies are still making great software just for the Mac, like the SoundJam MP program by Casady &amp; Greene (www.soundjammp.com), which gives the Apple faithful a full-featured program for creating and playing MP3 music files.</p>
        <p>I will also be scouring the Web for news of Mac OS X (as in 10), the long-awaited revamping of Apple's operating system. The drumbeats have been sounding about it for years, and Apple plans to release a public beta version for impatient Mac-heads to play with. Mac OS X includes enticing treats like a new graphical design, protected memory and pre-emptive multitasking -- fancy words that mean that when the goofy shareware of the giant eyeball self-destructs, your entire system won't crash along with it. The final version of the operating system isn't expected until at least January 2001.</p>
        <p>Even though using a Mac can be a bit more expensive than using a PC because of the extra software it takes to be fluent in Windows, I will keep using the Mac until a computer system I like better comes along. In the meantime, I have my eye on one of those new G4 Cubes. Apple has stuffed a lot of firepower into that little box, and the design of the thing has entranced me.</p>
        <p>And as I mentioned before, I have a small apartment.</p>
