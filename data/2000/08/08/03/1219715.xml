        <p>Drew Pearson, the former Dallas Cowboys receiver, will be named today as the general manager of the New York/New Jersey XFL franchise that will play at Giants Stadium, a league official said.</p>
        <p>Pearson joined the upstart football league at its formation in February and has been serving on its advisory committee.</p>
        <p>Last month, Dick Butkus, a Chicago Bears Hall of Fame linebacker, was named the coach of the Chicago team in the XFL, a venture of NBC and the World Wrestling Federation.</p>
        <p>Hiring Butkus and Pearson appears to be one strategy to insure that the XFL will play its football straight, without any infiltration from W.W.F.'s scripted mayhem. The XFL vows that it will play a looser, more entertaining brand of football than the N.F.L. It will start play in eight cities in February on Feb. 3, playing a 10-game season.</p>
        <p>The XFL has enlisted other former N.F.L. executives, including Ken Valdisseri, the general manager of the Chicago team, and Steve Ortmayer, who will be Memphis's director of player personnel.</p>
        <p>Gerry DiNardo, the former head coach of Louisiana State University, will coach the Birmingham team.</p>
        <p>In addition to New Jersey, Chicago, Memphis and Birmingham, the XFL will play in Orlando, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Jose.</p>
