        <p>General Motors will build a $500 million high-tech engine manufacturing plant at its complex in the Buffalo suburb of Tonawanda, saving 600 well-paying jobs through the largest private-sector investment in western New York State in many years, Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday.</p>

        <p>General Motors will build a $500 million high-tech engine manufacturing plant at its complex in the Buffalo suburb of Tonawanda, saving 600 well-paying jobs through the largest private-sector investment in western New York State in many years, Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Had the company chosen to build the plant in another state or in Canada or Mexico, something state officials said G.M. had been considering, it would have been a major blow to the Buffalo area because the 600 blue-collar jobs would have been phased out from the Tonawanda complex's 3,800 existing jobs.</p>
        <p>As it is, the Buffalo metropolitan area's unemployment rate was 5 percent in June compared with a 4.3 percent rate statewide. And as the economy has been booming, the Buffalo area has been adding jobs at a much slower rate than the state has over all. In the 12-month period ending in June, the number of jobs in the area increased by 2,300, or 0.4 percent, the lowest job growth rate in any metropolitan area in the state. The job increase rate statewide was 2.1 percent.</p>
        <p>''The threat was very strong to move the 600 jobs,'' Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said in an interview. Among the other options, officials said, were the 10 other engine plants the company has in the United States, Canada and Mexico.</p>
        <p>State and General Motors officials said the Tonawanda site was selected for the plant partly because of what Mr. Gargano called the state's incentive package, which included a commitment to spend $9 million to upgrade streets around the site and water and sewage facilities. They also cited an agreement permitting more flexible work rules that G.M. reached with the union.</p>
        <p>The Tonawanda complex produces four-, six- and eight-cylinder engines, and Mr. Gargano said that G.M. planned to phase out some of the old production lines there. The plant to be added at the site is intended to produce a six-cylinder, all aluminum, inline engine that will be used in a wide variety of G.M. cars and light trucks.</p>
        <p>Construction of the new plant is to begin later this year, and the plant is scheduled to begin operation in early 2003. Mr. Gargano said the construction alone would provide 600 jobs in the building trades.</p>
        <p>The Tonawanda supervisor, Ronald H. Moline, said that the G.M. engine complex had been a ''vital part of our industrial base for more than 50 years,'' in which thousands of area residents had been employed at  well-paying jobs. ''This expansion,'' he said, ''will add stability to our industrial base and to the lives of thousands of families.''</p>
