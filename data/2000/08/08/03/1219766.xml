        <p>So what is Conrad Black going to do with his bags of money now that he has sold most of the crown jewels of Canada's newspapers in one fell swoop?</p>
        <p>''Do you remember that cartoon character, Scrooge McDuck?'' Mr. Black said, answering a question with a question. ''Do you remember how he used to get into his little bulldozer every morning and plow back and forth over his gold coins? Well, maybe I will just sit and look at it for a while.''</p>

        <p>So what is Conrad Black going to do with his bags of money now that he has sold most of the crown jewels of Canada's newspapers in one fell swoop?</p>
        <p>''Do you remember that cartoon character, Scrooge McDuck?'' Mr. Black said, answering a question with a question. ''Do you remember how he used to get into his little bulldozer every morning and plow back and forth over his gold coins? Well, maybe I will just sit and look at it for a while.''</p>
        <p>Looking back to 1969 when he bought a tiny English-language paper in Quebec, Mr. Black, now 55, said, ''I started in this business 30 years ago with an investment of $500.''</p>
        <p>Returning to the present, he said of the deal announced this week: ''It was time in the history of my country, and time in my own history, to make things shipshape, to get rid of the debt, to get a bit of a cash box to work from, to enjoy life a little more.''</p>
        <p>Few pundits in newspapers today predicted an easy-chair life for Mr. Black, a Napoleon buff who has run his newspaper empire from a chair once owned by his military hero. As Mr. Black trims his sails in North America -- a sale of his community papers in the Chicago area is believed to be imminent -- Canadians believe he will turn his energies to Europe.</p>
        <p>A holder of dual British and Canadian citizenship and owner of The Daily Telegraph of London, Mr. Black could seek out new European investments for the company that on Monday bought most of his Canadian newspapers, the CanWest Global Communications Corporation, now Canada's largest media company.</p>
        <p>Commenting extensively about the deal for the first time since it was announced, Mr. Black said in a telephone interview Tuesday night that the sale to CanWest would leave his company, Hollinger Inc., on a solid financial footing. ''We will go from $1.7 billion in debt to zero plus $500 million in cash, perhaps a bit better than that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Noting that Hollinger stock had bounced back from depressed levels in recent months, he said he was selling his newspapers ''fairly close to the top of the economic cycle.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Black also justified his heavy sell-off here, saying he was ''overexposed in Canada.'' In a separate interview with The National Post, his Toronto-based newspaper, Mr. Black added, ''The reputation of Canada is not particularly great among American investors.''</p>
        <p>Although Americans have poured billions into the Toronto Stock Exchange this year, helping it to rise faster than the New York exchanges, Mr. Black said his pool of buyers was artificially limited by Canadian laws that discourage foreigners from buying Canadian newspapers. Noting that Canada is essentially off limits to American newspaper chains, he complained, ''With these ridiculous foreign-ownership rules in Canada, you can't get much equity.''</p>
        <p>Israel Asper, the chairman of CanWest, has predicted that the editorial line of his newspapers will be ''balanced,'' a word rarely found in the lexicon of Mr. Black, a crusty, conservative press baron who has been described by detractors as a thesaurus that walks like a man.</p>
        <p>In response, Mr. Black snorted at newspaper characterizations of Mr. Asper as a ''social democrat,'' saying that he and his new business partner see eye to eye on economic issues and recalling that he first met Mr. Asper 25 years ago when he was writing a personal tax column for The Winnipeg Free Press. Questioned further, he acknowledged having had ''a bit of wrestling match with Izzy'' over The National Post, which in less than two years has established an intellectual beachhead for conservative, free-market changes in Canada.</p>
        <p>After the wrestling was over, ownership of The National Post was split 50-50 between the two business groups. Mr. Black, who is to be chairman of the newspaper for five years, says it sells 330,000 copies daily.</p>
        <p>''Under our arrangement, he has no ability to change it,'' Mr. Black said of Mr. Asper and the editorial line of The Post, which has become a cheerleader for the Canadian Alliance, the nation's new tax-cutting party. Asked if the editorial line would change, he stressed: ''Zero, nothing, not one millimeter.''</p>
        <p>But leaders of Canada's ruling Liberal Party, frequent target of criticism from the editorial pages of Mr. Black's newspapers, were elated at news of the purchase by Mr. Asper, a longtime centrist Liberal.</p>
        <p>Calling the sale ''the best news they had had in a long time,'' Lawrence Martin, a Southam News political analyst, wrote from Ottawa of the Liberals: ''Even a measured neutrality will be viewed by the prime minister as a major plus over the treatment he felt he was receiving before the newspaper sale.''</p>
        <p>The government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien has not given the slightest hint that it will move to block the sale.</p>
        <p>Toronto is home to one of the toughest newspaper wars in the English-speaking world, a three-way battle among The National Post, The Globe and Mail and The Toronto Star. On Tuesday, The Globe and Mail printed on the top of its front page a large full-color cartoon of Mr. Asper grinning and preparing to dine on a prostrate Mr. Black, who was depicted stuffed and spiced, with a sprig of parsley in each ear. The headlines read: ''Asper: Mogul and a half'' and ''Black: Only half a mogul.''</p>
        <p>Despite its gloating, The Globe and Mail now stands alone, virtually the only major English-language Canadian newspaper that does not have ties to CanWest, which has a Canadian network of television stations broadcasting coast to coast.</p>
        <p>After a day of reflection, The Globe and Mail came out today with an editorial salted with crocodile tears and headlined: ''Black to fade.''</p>
        <p>''Since Canada does not have so many larger-than-life characters that it can afford to lose any of them cheerfully, the notion of a vanishing Conrad Black is rather affecting,'' the editorial said. In a service to readers, it warned that some Canadians ''will experience the disorientation that follows the abrupt end of a toothache.''</p>
