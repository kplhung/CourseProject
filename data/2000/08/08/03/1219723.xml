        <p>Tari Phillips spun her head from side to side, whipping her four pigtails behind her as she launched into song:</p>
        <p>''I am Pippi Longstocking,'' she crooned in perfect pitch. ''I am Pippi Longstocking, if you haven't heard.''</p>
        <p>It was hard not to hear Phillips's off-off-Broadway routine from the Liberty's Madison Square Garden locker room Monday night. Her teammates laughed and said, ''That's just Tari.''</p>
        <p>Known for being flighty off the court, Phillips has skipped to her own time schedule and her own show tunes this season. At center, the 6-foot-2-inch Phillips has entertained her teammates as well, grabbing rebounds ferociously and passing selflessly from the post. '' 'That's Tari' is the reason why we're in the playoffs,'' Liberty General Manager Carol Blazejowski said.</p>
        <p>Phillips, who is averaging a team-high 13.8 points and 8 rebounds per game, is also a big reason the Liberty could win its third Eastern Conference title next week. In a city that embraces the unique, Phillips has found her stage. But her sweet smile hides the pain she endured to get to this point.</p>
        <p>''She's her own person; she's in her own little world,'' forward Sue Wicks said. ''She makes us all laugh. She's fit in really well here. And she has a world of talent. I'm thinking about it all the time: 'Who would let her go?' ''</p>
        <p>Two teams let her go. Left unprotected by the Orlando Miracle last season and traded by the expansion Portland Fire to the Liberty the day before this season began, the 31-year-old Phillips became a Women's National Basketball Association All-Star with the Liberty and is a top contender for the league's most improved player award.</p>
        <p>''I think people in the league knew Tari was a talented athlete, but I don't think anyone thought she would bring it to the next level like she has,'' said Blazejowski, who included herself among the doubters.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow night, Orlando comes to the Garden in the throes of a six-game losing streak. When the Miracle, her hometown team, drafted her in the first round last year, it seemed the perfect situation. But while close to her family, which numbers nearly 80 people, Phillips averaged 4.1 points and 2.1 rebounds under Carolyn Peck, the former Purdue coach.</p>
        <p>After being a two-time All-Star with the now-defunct American Basketball League, Phillips became a backup to another former A.B.L. star, Taj McWilliams. ''I was proud and very controlled,'' Phillips said. ''But I was sitting on the bench thinking I could wreak a lot of havoc.''</p>
        <p>Her quirky style did not mesh with the team, and she became frustrated. ''You see half the people in the stands who know you and they're asking you: 'What's going on? What's happening?' '' Phillips said. ''You don't really have the answers.''</p>
        <p>After the season, Phillips left to play in Sicily, and Portland took her in the expansion draft. Liberty Coach Richie Adubato went to Italy to scout her, and noticed how she had lost weight and was playing in top condition. Blazejowski had to trade for a center when Kym Hampton retired again at the beginning of the season, Venus Lacey had a poor training camp and Rebecca Lobo seemed likely to miss the season rehabilitating her left knee.</p>
        <p>Phillips left Sicily in May, the day after leading her team to the Italian league championship. After traveling for 24 hours, she made it to Portland for one practice and flew with the team for a preseason game in Minnesota. The next day, Portland agreed to trade her to the Liberty in exchange for Carolyn Young-Jones, a small forward who missed last season when she was pregnant and who missed this season rehabilitating a knee injury.</p>
        <p>By this time, Phillips was tired of moving. ''If you guys want me, I want to play,'' she told Blazejowski. ''I packed my bags that afternoon.''</p>
        <p>While the Liberty battled injuries, and she was learning the plays, the team went 7-9 at the halfway mark. Since then, the Liberty is 11-1, with Phillips dominating on both ends. ''Tari's like a guard in a 5-body,'' forward Vickie Johnson said. ''I think there is no one in this league who can defend her. When she's on, she's on.''</p>
        <p>Point guard Teresa Weatherspoon now calls Phillips by her initials, which she says also stand for ''Too Proper'' and ''Total Package.''</p>
        <p>Some teammates in Orlando did not agree. At the All-Star Game in Phoenix, a group of Miracle players started snickering when they saw Phillips, and the way they mocked the Liberty center angered Wicks. '' 'Oh, that's just Tari,' they said, and I defended her,'' Wicks recalled.</p>
        <p>But Phillips just turned away. ''I have no animosity for the other players or teams,'' she said. ''I'm on a mission to win a W.N.B.A. championship.''</p>
        <p>So what if Phillips gets sidetracked window shopping or wandering off in airports, or ices her knees right before tipoff? Adubato lets her do it her way, although he has handed her a few $150 fines for being late this season.</p>
        <p>''She's funding our postseason picnic,'' he said. But Phillips is providing for it as well.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Liberty playoff tickets will go on sale today at noon at the Madison Square Garden box office, all Ticketmaster outlets and online at www.ticketmaster.com. The top four teams in each conference will make the playoffs, and each playoff series will be two games of three.</p>
