        <p>The absence of the MetroStars' leading middle defenders was evident tonight as several costly mistakes on defense led to a 3-2 overtime loss to D.C. United at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium.</p>
        <p>In danger of missing the playoffs and in desperate need of points, United played with more urgency in a game marked by physical play. United was certainly the better team in the overtime and won on A. J. Wood's deflection after a shot by Richie Williams, in the last minute of the 10-minute overtime.</p>
        <p>Raul Diaz Arce and Jaime Moreno scored the goals in regulation for United (6-13-6), while Adolfo Valencia and Billy Walsh scored the goals for the MetroStars (13-9-2), who suffered their first loss in the last 10 games (7-1-2). The start of the game was delayed for 33 minutes after D. C. United had to change jerseys because Referee Marcel Yonan said the teams were wearing shirts that were too similar.</p>
        <p>Mike Petke and Daniel Hernandez have been the main players in the middle of the defense all season for the Metrostars, but Petke was serving a one-game suspension and Hernandez suffered a season-ending knee injury last week. With Lothar Matthaus not 100 percent fit for league action, the MetroStars were forced to field an unfamiliar defense. Coach Octavio Zambrano used Thomas Dooley and Mark Semioli in the middle of the defense for the first time this season. It was from the middle of the defense that D.C. United scored all three goals.</p>
        <p>''We lost the match because at crucial times of the game we made some mental errors,'' Zambrano said of his central defenders. ''This combination has not played too much together and it showed in this game.''</p>
        <p>Semioli made only his fourth start of the season, and his rustiness was evident. He made the biggest mistake in the game, which cost the MetroStars. Semioli lackadaisically tried to pass the ball to his goalkeeper, Mike Ammann, but his pass was so soft that Diaz Arce picked it off easily and slid the ball underneath the onrushing Ammann for his fourth goal of the season.</p>
        <p>The goal by Diaz Arce, 5 minutes 21 seconds into the game, was the earliest goal the MetroStars allowed this season. The goal could have easily rattled the MetroStars, but they showed a great deal of composure and tied the game in the 30th minute on a penalty kick by Valencia.</p>
        <p>The penalty was awarded to the MetroStars when Petter Villegas was taken down in the penalty area by Jeff Agoos, the left fullback. Valencia executed the kick calmly, sending the goalkeeper, Mark Simpson, the wrong way for his 11th goal of the season.</p>
        <p>Moreno put United in the lead in the 68th minute, but Walsh tied the score for the MetroStars with a header after a cross from the right wing by Steve Shak in the 86th minute, setting the stage for the overtime and Wood's winner.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>Two other regulars, ROY MYERS and RAMIRO CORRALES, also missed the game for the MetroStars. Myers, who has been creative in midfield, is nursing a left calf strain he suffered in practice last week, while Corrales served a one-game suspension because of accumulation of yellow cards. . . . Defender DANIEL HERNANDEZ underwent successful reconstructive surgery on his right knee Wednesday. . . . The MetroStars will play in Chicago on Sunday in a league game against the Fire and will play in Columbus against the Crew on Wednesday in a quarterfinal game for the United States Open Cup. . . . After changing to their regular home jerseys of solid black with some white horizontal stripes, United came out on to the field at about 7:58 p.m. and was greeted by the roar of an impatient crowd. United sent someone to retrieve different jerseys from its practice site about 40 minutes away, but he became stuck in traffic.</p>
