        <p>Over one month, three home furnishings stores -- Interieurs, Waterworks and Room -- will have opened in Manhattan, the first two because they outgrew their previous locations and the third because it wanted to be more than just a Miami shop with a catalog. ''One-third of our customers are in the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut area,'' said Amy Crain, near left, the owner of Room. Last week, her new 2,500-square-foot store, designed by S.

        <p>Waterworks is a chain of 28 stores that promote the bathroom as a complete environment. Its two Manhattan stores were not large enough, so a 7,500-square-foot shop is to open today at 225 East 57th Street, replacing a smaller showroom. The stores offer the complete bathroom -- from, at left, towels ($44) to tubs ($3,500).</p>
