        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani agreed yesterday that more must be done to relieve New York's housing shortage, and he promised to explore proposals from three prominent politicians for major new subsidized construction.</p>
        <p>''No question, more has to be done,'' the mayor said. ''Affordable housing is a big problem in New York City.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani made the remarks in response to a City Hall news conference at which the participants, all Democrats, called on the Republican mayor to take action.</p>
        <p>The participants -- former Mayor Edward I. Koch, the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, and the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields -- proposed that he appoint a task force to prepare a program to encourage housing construction. They also urged that a housing trust fund be created and that new housing be financed through budget surpluses and additional property tax revenues expected after the state sells the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>The mayor sounded receptive. ''We are going to look into all those ideas,'' he said. ''Those are all ideas worth looking at. There are always more things that should be done.''</p>
        <p>In proposing an ambitious new program, Ms. Fields said: ''We're facing a growing housing crisis that shows no sign of letting up. This city hasn't had a comprehensive housing plan in a decade.'' Referring to Mr. Giuliani's push for new sports stadiums, she said, ''If we can build homes for minor league sports teams, we can certainly build them for all New Yorkers.''</p>
        <p>In his own defense, Mr. Giuliani said that since 1994 his administration had spent $1.6 billion to build or renovate 60,000 dwellings. City Council aides said that nearly half that money came from other sources, and that half the homes were built by the New York City Partnership, a business and civic group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone said the housing shortage was forcing middle- and working-class residents to leave the city. ''It's estimated that 200,000 units are needed right now,'' Mr. Vallone said. ''Over half a million New Yorkers are now paying more than half their income for rent. This is an unacceptable situation.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fields said that the city needed to find sites for construction, including unused manufacturing areas and city-owned property.</p>
