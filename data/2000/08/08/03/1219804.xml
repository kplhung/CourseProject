        <p>The legendary outlaw Veerappan, a lean man with a twirling, jet black mustache, has ranged through the vast jungles of South India for a generation, slaughtering elephants for their ivory tusks, smuggling out perfumed sandalwood and playing Robin Hood to the forest dwellers, the authorities say.</p>
        <p>For a decade, hundreds of policemen have been dedicated to nothing but hunting him down. He is wanted for killing dozens of them, as well as strangling his newborn daughter to silence her telltale cries.</p>
        <p>He has eluded capture, but life on the run has taken a heavy toll. He is in his 50's now, an aging brigand with asthma and a bad stomach who yearns to come in from the cold and live a normal life.</p>
        <p>On Sunday he put into action what the police are calling his boldest, most diabolical plan yet to win a pardon. He abducted Rajkumar, 72, a beloved movie star whose half-century-long career portraying Hindu gods, kings of yore and heroes of every kind has endowed him with a mythical stature of his own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Veerappan, who like many South Indians including his captive goes by only one name, took Mr. Rajkumar to a jungle lair and has kept silent about what he wants, letting the drama build. But the police expect his demand to be simple: his freedom for Mr. Rajkumar's life.</p>
        <p>A notorious gangster's kidnapping a matinee idol would transfix the public of any nation, but perhaps only in India would it provoke groups of fans to stone passing cars, blockade major roads with flaming tires, press shopkeepers to pull down their shutters -- and bring life in a bustling metropolis to a halt.</p>
        <p>That is just what happened on Monday and Tuesday in Bangalore, the heart of India's booming information technology industry and one of Asia's fastest-growing cities. As word of the abduction spread on Monday, his fans crowded the streets to protest and give vent to their fury. Most people went back to work today and bus service was restored, but schools remained closed, a ban on public gatherings stayed in place, traffic was light and anxiety remained palpable.</p>
        <p>''Bangalore is a cosmopolitan town, like Bombay,'' said U. R. Ananthamurthy, a novelist and poet writing in Kannada, the native tongue of most people in the state of Karnataka and the language spoken by Mr. Rajkumar in his more than 200 films. ''It belongs to the modern world system and thinks it can ignore mass psychology. But it forgets that other reality that lurks within.''</p>
        <p>Here in South India, movie stars and their millions of fans can be compared to religious deities and their devotees. Mr. Rajkumar, who came from a low-caste family and grew into a symbol of regional pride, has a huge and committed following.</p>
        <p>In Bangalore alone he has hundreds of fan clubs organized down to the neighborhood level, like a political machine. But unlike N. T. Rama Rao of Andhra Pradesh or M. G. Ramachandran of Tamil Nadu, film stars, now dead, who became the chief ministers of their states, Mr. Rajkumar has stayed out of politics -- and is all the more trusted by his fans because of it. They have flocked to his home weeping and chanting slogans for his release.</p>
        <p>''I worship Rajkumar as a god,'' said Nagaraj, a somber 22-year-old who pumps gas for a living. He was not being purely metaphorical.</p>
        <p>South Indian movie stars who choose to play virtuous heroes and mythological figures from the great Hindu epics are identified in the minds of their audiences with those values, said Sara Dickey, an anthropologist and author of ''Cinema and the Urban Poor in South India'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993).</p>
        <p>''It's easier in India for humans to become deities than in some other cultures,'' Ms. Dickey said, ''certainly more than in the Western Judeo-Christian traditions.''</p>
        <p>The drama is so like the plot of one of Mr. Rajkumar's films, and the pairing of these two larger-than-life characters so perfect -- Mr. Rajkumar in his familiar role as the gentle hero and Mr. Veerappan as the swashbuckling villain -- that the line between life and art seems almost to have disappeared.</p>
        <p>Both men have gained maximum visibility in their respective dominions. And for the police officers who have spent years chasing Mr. Veerappan, the knowledge that he has Mr. Rajkumar is chilling.</p>
        <p>''He's a cunning, ruthless criminal,'' said Shankar M. Bidari, an inspector general in the Karnataka state police who spent more than three years in the mid-1990's commanding 200 men in pursuit of Mr. Veerappan. ''He wants to escape the clutches of the law, and he will sacrifice anybody. He's tired. He's desperate. And he knows there's no way out for him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Veerappan has survived on his wits all these years in forests, making his way through them on paths trod by elephants. At the peak of his power in the 1980's he employed thousands of people in his sandalwood lumbering empire and more than 100 armed gangsters to keep everyone in line, Mr. Bidari said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Veerappan and his henchmen knew the ways of the jungle and mimicked the birds and deer in a system of warning signals that helped them dodge the authorities.</p>
        <p>The people who lived on the fringes of the forest often protected Mr. Veerappan because he was their patron. He gave them jobs, helped the poorest among them to pay for their daughters' weddings, built temples and kept meddlesome bureaucrats away with well-placed bribes, the police say.</p>
        <p>But his murderous tendencies became more pronounced as the years went by, and in 1990 the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka set up teams of officers to pursue the Veerappan gang into the jungles that span their border.</p>
        <p>Ten years later, Mr. Veerappan stands accused of 141 murders, Mr. Bidari says, but is still at large, a fact that doubtless goads his pursuers. Still, he has been forced into a nomadic life that has worn him down and cost him most of his men, the police say. Dozens have been killed in encounters with the police, and more than 100 have been arrested.</p>
        <p>Under interrogation, some have described their leader's life as one of unceasing movement, with never more than a night of sleep in any one camp, the police say. When it rains he has only plastic sheeting over his head. He eats dal and rice, buried at spots in the jungle, and wild boar and birds hunted there.</p>
        <p>''He used to walk briskly in the forest,'' said C. Dinakar, director general of the Karnataka state police, adding: ''Now we have received information that he's slowed down. He has breathing problems and diseases of the colon from cooking in dirty water.''</p>
        <p>Since 1994, Mr. Veerappan has tried several times to surrender in exchange for a pardon. In 1996 and 1997 he kidnapped batches of people and demanded amnesty, but eventually freed his hostages when he was refused. Then for several years he simply dropped out of sight -- until Sunday night.</p>
        <p>At 9:30 p.m., he and 11 of his gunmen strolled into Mr. Rajkumar's farmhouse in the village of Gajanur in Tamil Nadu, just six miles from the edge of the forest. The movie star was sitting on a couch with his wife watching the local news. The couple recognized Mr. Veerappan's trademark mustache.</p>
        <p>''Why are you taking us?'' Mr. Rajkumar's wife, Parvathamma, recalled asking. ''We've never done anything to you. We will give you whatever we have.''</p>
        <p>''I want only Sir,'' Mr. Veerappan replied respectfully, promising that he would take care of her husband and proclaiming himself one of the movie star's fans, and then threatening to kill him if she notified the police after they left.</p>
        <p>''You want me, take me,'' she said her husband firmly replied. ''But don't harm anyone else.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Veerappan gave Mrs. Rajkumar an audio casette and instructed her to take it to the chief minister of Karnataka. He then picked up the elderly actor's spectacles, tucked them into a pocket and led him away, dressed only in loincloth, shirt and sandals. Three other hostages were also taken.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Rajkumar and two of her servants drove through the night in a lashing rainstorm and reached the chief minister's residence here in Bangalore after 2 a.m. Monday. They had called to alert him.</p>
        <p>The tape revealed the kidnapper's only request: that an official emissary be chosen to visit him and convey his demands. The Karnataka chief minister flew to Madras to meet with his counterpart in Tamil Nadu. They agreed to dispatch a magazine editor, R. Raja Gopal, as the emissary. Mr. Gopal headed into the jungle the next day, Tuesday, and has not yet been heard from. Messages from Mr. Rajkumar's family have been broadcast on All India Radio in hopes that he and his abductor will hear them on the transistor radio that Mr. Veerappan carries.</p>
        <p>''I appeal to you in all humbleness and with love and affection to send him home soon,'' Mrs. Rajkumar pleaded. ''He has knee pain. Don't make him walk. I trust in you.''</p>
        <p>On the streets outside the star's home, his fans gathered in mute, anguished clumps on Tuesday and today, though policemen waving long wooden sticks kept chasing them away.</p>
        <p>As one fan, Byalapp Chandrashekar, 28, put it, ''We don't like to see our god suffering.''</p>
