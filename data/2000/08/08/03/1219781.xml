        <p>A leading Irish developer of encryption software, Baltimore Technologies P.L.C., reported higher-than-expected revenue of $38.5 million and a smaller-than-expected loss of $6.6 million for the first half of the year. The results at the company, which is closely watched as a developer of Internet security for financial transactions, suggested it was far closer to profitability than had been thought, and its shares rose $2, to $21.3125, on the Nasdaq market. Software license sales, an indicator of the company's foothold in the market, were up 500 percent and accounted for more than half of revenue.</p>
