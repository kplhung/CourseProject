        <p>The Nasdaq stock market stumbled yesterday as skittish investors sought safety in blue chip stocks or headed for the sidelines waiting for Friday's report on the job market in July.</p>
        <p>Although the decline in the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was modest, 27.06 points, or 0.7 percent, to 3,658.46, analysts found little reason for optimism. They said that high-technology shares, especially semiconductor companies, are prone to summertime slumps and that stocks carrying high prices relative to earnings seem most vulnerable to rising interest rates.</p>
        <p>''There's still not a very high level of conviction that the economy is slowing enough that the Federal Reserve can stop tapping the brakes,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. The Fed, which has pushed short-term rates up six times in the last 13 months, is scheduled to meet next on Aug. 22. The government's tally of early-summer employment and other economic reports will figure in the Fed's decision.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80.58 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,687.53. Hewlett-Packard jumped 4 5/8, to 112 1/2, and I.B.M. increased  4 1/8, to 114 11/16. Exxon Mobil rose 1 1/2, to 81 7/16; Johnson &amp; Johnson gained 1 11/16, to 96 1/2; and Home Depot rose 1 1/8, to 53 1/8. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.60 of a point, to 1,438.70.</p>
        <p>Stocks were buoyed by news that sales of new homes fell for a third consecutive month to the lowest pace in more than years and by comments from William Poole, the president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, whose benign view of inflation risks implied that the Fed might be able to forgo further rate increases.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq's poor performance seemed to cast a pall over the market in general. Dell Computer skidded 2, to 39 9/16, after being downgraded by an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray who questioned projected revenue growth. Cisco Systems fell 2 1/4, to 60 15/16.</p>
        <p>''There's a tremendous amount of negative sentiment,'' said Matthew W. Johnson, chief Nasdaq trader at Lehman Brothers. ''Some people are taking money off the table,'' he added, while others are switching into more defensive positions, like those provided by established companies in oils, pharmaceuticals and utilities.</p>
        <p>While investors hope the Fed can rein in the strong economy to avoid inflation, the risk is that profit growth will slacken.</p>
        <p>''Wall Street's consensus forecast that S.&amp; P. 500 operating earnings will grow 12 percent to 15 percent annually is more than a stretch,'' a Chase Securities report said.</p>
        <p>One of the day's biggest winners was the Sapient Corporation, which jumped 16 15/16, to 120 13/16, after announcing better-than-expected earnings and a 2-for-1 stock split.</p>
        <p>A prominent casualty was Cigna, which dropped 4 11/16, to 96 9/16, after it said earnings growth was being hurt by problems in disability insurance.</p>
