        <p>A 4-month-old infant was raped in her baby sitter's apartment in Passaic last week, and a teenage relative of the sitter's was ordered held in $200,000 bail today on charges of aggravated sexual assault, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The baby girl underwent surgery for genital injuries inflicted during the assault, which occurred on July 24, and was hospitalized for nearly a week, said Boris Moczula, first assistant prosecutor in Passaic County.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moczula said county investigators were surprised at the age of the girl when they first learned of the  attack, and verified her age at St. Joseph's Hospital in Paterson after the surgery. She is thought to be the youngest victim of a sexual assault in Passaic County history, he said.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Marios Patino Cabrera, 18, was arrested on July 27. As he appeared in New Jersey Superior Court in Paterson today, detectives arrested the baby sitter and accused her of giving investigators false information about the attack.</p>
        <p>''Evidence suggests she knew an assault occurred,'' he said. The baby sitter, Rosalba Rodriguez, 24, was charged with endangering the welfare of a child for failing to seek medical help for the baby and, later, lying to investigators, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cabrera, who works in a clothing factory in Newark, is believed to be a cousin of the baby sitter's husband and lives in their apartment in Passaic with several other relatives of the couple. Mr. Moczula said the residents, as well as the victim's family, were illegal immigrants from Mexico. Ms. Rodriguez had served as the infant's baby sitter since May, he said.</p>
        <p>The attack occurred about 11:30 a.m. on July 24, Mr. Moczula said. In midmorning, he said, Ms. Rodriguez placed the baby on her bed to sleep. The assault is thought to have occurred there, Mr. Moczula said.</p>
        <p>In early afternoon, the baby sitter called the infant's mother at work and told her the baby had bled while being given a bath. The baby sitter said she thought the bleeding was caused by a diaper that had been put on backward, Mr. Moczula said.</p>
        <p>The baby's mother examined her and found injuries to her genitals.</p>
        <p>The baby was discharged from St. Joseph's Hospital last weekend.</p>
