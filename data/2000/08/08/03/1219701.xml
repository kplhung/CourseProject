        <p>Editorial on Sen Robert Torricelli's withdrawal from New Jersey gubernatorial race holds his brief bid for nomination leaves wounded Democratic Party with new fractures</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Perhaps the best that can be said of Senator Robert Torricelli's leap into the icy preliminaries of next year's gubernatorial race in New Jersey is that he leapt out again so quickly. Three weeks after declaring plans to run for governor, the ambitious senator suddenly decided to keep his job in Washington. Many of the state's most powerful Democrats had refused to desert his rival James McGreevey, who almost defeated Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in 1997. Their reasons ranged from fair play to political revenge against Mr. Torricelli to the results of a quick weekend poll that showed Mr. McGreevey more popular.</p>
        <p>As a result of his public misstep, Mr. Torricelli said he had been ''humbled,'' an added value for any senator in the grand hallways of Congress. But back in his home state, the senator's intrigues leave his own wounded political party with a few new fractures. One of the more telling plots starred Representative Robert Menendez of Union City, who has been simmering for months over a broken Torricelli promise of support in this year's Senate race. Mr.  Menendez and other state leaders basically stalled a few public endorsements for Mr. Torricelli while Mr. McGreevey lined up enough supporters to ruin the senator's sudden appetite for one of the most powerful governorships in the country.</p>

        <p>As he backed out of the race, Mr. Torricelli refused to endorse Mr. McGreevey while Mr. McGreevey sniped that ''The Democratic Party is greater than any individual's political ambitions,'' meaning greater than Senator Torricelli's. For Democrats, the only good news is that this important state election is still more than a year away.</p>
