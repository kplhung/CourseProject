        <p>Determined to toughen up by adding another power forward to their roster, the Knicks will entertain Danny Fortson, the 6-foot-7-inch free agent from the Boston Celtics, today.</p>
        <p>Even though he played only 15 minutes a game last season, Fortson has established himself as one of the league's best offensive rebounders in his three years in the National Basketball Association and would unquestionably strengthen the weakest area of the Knicks' game.</p>
        <p>''We're going to show him the city and our practice site, and we'll have him up to Westchester for a little while,'' said Scott Layden, the Knicks' general manager. ''Then he'll stay in the city and leave the next day.''</p>
        <p>Though he apparently will not get the yacht ride afforded Portland's Brian Grant last month, Fortson has been a priority for the Knicks since July 1, when they telephoned him shortly after midnight and mailed him a team jersey with his name on the back. In an attempt to assure themselves of getting a valuable player in return for Fortson, the Celtics extended him a multiyear contract offer, but when the Knicks offered point guard Chris Childs, Boston was unmoved.</p>
        <p>After failing to fill their shooting guard position with either Ron Mercer or Tariq Abdul-Wahad, however, the Celtics may now be willing to take Childs. They have turned their attention to signing a point guard, and the Knicks' backup looks especially good considering what is left on the market.</p>
        <p>To make such a sign-and-trade deal work, the Celtics would need to include another player, perhaps Doug Overton. The Knicks might prefer to sign Fortson for the $2.25 million mid-level exception, and while Raymond Brothers, Fortson's agent, has said his client would not play for such a small salary, the likelihood of his accepting the exception is growing.</p>
        <p>The market is awfully thin, and Fortson may not be able to get more money elsewhere. Last week, he was enamored with the Golden State Warriors and spoke as if he would join them for $2.25 million, so it is likely that the Knicks will be able to sell him on the merits of playing a key role for a conference contender.</p>
        <p>Fortson will be the second power forward behind Washington's Aaron Williams, a 6-9 journeyman, to visit the Knicks this week.</p>
        <p>Though he is not as good a rebounder as Fortson, Williams is more athletic and might be offered the $2.25 million exception if the Knicks are not able to get Fortson.</p>
        <p>The visits from Fortson and Williams may imply that the Knicks' chances of obtaining Grant are all but dead. There are strong indications that Grant will end up in Cleveland in a sign-and-trade deal that will send Shawn Kemp to Portland.</p>
        <p>Both teams want to do the deal, but Grant, a native of southern Ohio, is not keen on playing in Cleveland. Unless he accepts less money, Grant may not have a choice, though, as Bob Whitsitt, the Portland president, has said he would sign Grant and trade him for Kemp during the season if Grant refuses to agree to the sign-and-trade now.</p>
        <p>The Knicks, with the assistance of Mark Bartelstein, Grant's agent, are hoping to make it a three-team deal that would bring Grant to New York and send Marcus Camby and Childs to Cleveland. But the Cavaliers have little interest in Camby.</p>
