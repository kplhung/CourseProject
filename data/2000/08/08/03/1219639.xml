        <p>WHILE living in Iowa two years ago, I saw the sky turn green. A number of events rapidly followed: the tornado sirens blared, my husband and I took shelter downstairs, and the Weather Channel visuals blipped off the television set. Then the electricity went out, and I frantically wondered if I had remembered to recharge the radio's batteries so we could monitor the tornado's movement.</p>
        <p>Had I? Of course not. For me, and for most people in the developed world, the occasional power disruption cannot disrupt the expectation that as sure as the sun rises, the lights will go on in the morning when the bedroom switch is clicked. But there are increasingly more situations where it is desirable or necessary to be independent of the electricity grid and freed of what Rory Stear, the chief executive of Freeplay Energy, a company that makes hand-powered radios and flashlights, calls ''the tyranny of the disposable battery.''</p>
        <p>Situations where you might not want to be -- or cannot be -- tethered to an electrical socket include boating and camping, as well as crises that knock out power, like tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes. In many places in developing nations, there is no electricity grid to knock out, but people there still need electricity. And the need for easily available energy is compounded as laptops, cell phones and personal digital assistants put portable computing into more hands.</p>
        <p>The alternative energy source is old-fashioned. All you need are some calories, H2 O, O2  and maybe some vitamins. The human body is a powerful source of energy. Many electrical devices now taken for granted had human-powered antecedents that date to only a generation ago. My farm-girl mother can remember churning butter by hand, and my father recalls starting a friend's Model T Ford, ''a temperamental beast,'' with a hand crank. Today, companies are looking at ways to use the human body to power CD players, cell phones and even home computers.</p>
        <p>Most human-powered devices are entirely mechanical, with a direct relationship between input and output. Simple human-powered devices that use electricity, like bicycle lights, can generate energy but not store it.</p>
        <p>But the human-powered devices being developed today are designed to use energy more efficiently and, most important, are built to store energy.</p>
        <p>Freeplay Energy, which was formed in 1995, sells a human-powered flashlight lantern and human-powered radios. Cranking the handle on its newest handheld radio for 30 seconds yields about 45 minutes of play (larger models play for an hour with 30 seconds of cranking). The same effort provides three to six minutes of light from the Freeplay lantern.</p>
        <p>The Freeplay products use a mechanism that winds a steel spring from one spool to another.</p>
        <p>When the spring returns to its original position, it drives a DC generator, which sends current to the device. Successive cranking can also store energy in the lantern's rechargeable battery, or the lantern can be plugged into an outlet. Some Freeplay radios can capture solar energy.</p>
        <p>Similar products on the market include the Nightstar flashlight made by Applied Innovative Technologies. The company's president, Steve Vetorino, said, ''Thirty seconds of shaking at three shakes per second will provide high illumination for five minutes and a lesser light (enough to read by) for about 20 minutes.'' For longer illumination, Mr. Vetorino said, the Nightstar should be turned off every two to three minutes and shaken for 10 to 15 seconds. The shaking makes a magnet move through a wire coil, generating current, which can be stored.</p>
        <p>Hand-cranked products are sold for diverse reasons all over the world. The Freeplay radios are bought and distributed by many international aid agencies working in remote places, like Kosovo. In the United States, the radios and lights are bought by campers and by some households to keep for emergencies.</p>
        <p>Freeplay's sales rose significantly in the United States at the end of last year because of concerns about Year 2000 problems. The sales in this country indicated an Olympian level of panic, while sales were calm and orderly in Britain and Germany.</p>
        <p>As the Web increasingly becomes liberated from wire, the application of human power to computing and communications will become more crucial.</p>
        <p>If you have the latest laptop, pager, cell phone or P.D.A., you can go a fair way without recharging, but you cannot go on safari in the Serengeti. A number of companies and institutions are addressing that problem.</p>
        <p>The Freeplay lantern can already be used to power another device, like a personal stereo. Freeplay is also developing pocket devices to power things like cell phones or P.D.A.'s and larger hand-cranked generators for writers who have laptops and good upper arm tone and who want to escape to desert islands.</p>
        <p>For the past year, the Bridges Equipment Company has has been selling AladdinPower devices -- human-powered electricity generators invented by Nissho Engineering, a Japanese company. AladdinPower was recently spun off as its own company, based in Tampa.</p>
        <p>AladdinPower's handheld rechargers and  its Stepcharger, which is pumped by stepping on it (but it is now out of stock), can be used to power cell phones, handheld radios, personal CD players and, in the case of the Stepcharger, which operates at a higher voltage, laptops.</p>
        <p>Keith Collins, president and chief executive of AladdinPower, said that about two to three minutes of pumping on the handheld charger gave a cell phone user approximately 20 minutes to use the phone, depending on the vigor of the pumping. Tens of thousands of AladdinPower units have been sold, Mr. Collins said. He predicted that ''300 million units will be sold in the next 10 years because of the expansion of cellular markets worldwide.''</p>
        <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory is working on human-powered electric devices, but in a far sneakier way. The idea of this parasitic power harvesting is to generate power in an ancillary way while people are doing things like walking or typing, or to pick up energy from the body as it breathes, pumps blood and generates heat.</p>
        <p>All of these potential sources of power were examined in 1995 by Dr. Thad Starner, who was then a graduate student at the Media Lab and is now an assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology; he concluded that the heel strike would be the most easily tapped and potent source of energy.</p>
        <p>Since then, Dr. Joseph A. Paradiso, a researcher at the Media Lab, and his students have developed various shoe inserts that convert walking energy into electrical current. The inserts are made of a piezoelectric material, which generates voltage when placed under mechanical stress. Dr. Paradiso said the Maxwell Smart-like shoe could power pagers, health monitors and emergency receivers, or it could be used to charge a battery to power devices like phones or small computers.</p>
        <p>''It's probably the best way to take energy out of the body,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the balance between energy harvesting and a comfy shoe isn't easy to achieve. ''If you do it wrong,'' Dr. Paradiso said, ''they'll be the worst shoes you ever wore.''  His research group is not the only one hoping to develop a power shoe prototype. The Electric Shoe Company, based in Britain, is also working on the technology.</p>
        <p>For such a shoe to be a viable commercial product, people would have to find it to be durable, affordable and worth wearing as a fashion statement.</p>
        <p>The ability to scavenge power from the human body is also of interest to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, which is also developing shoe-power programs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert Nowak, a program manager at Darpa, said researchers wanted to generate one to two watts per shoe. He said, ''Most similar technologies produce only milliwatts, which won't have much practical value for the military user.'' The shoes will be used to power radios, computers and night vision and navigational equipment, as well as to recharge batteries. They could also power detectors that could warn soldiers away from mine fields</p>
        <p>One challenge for harnessing human power is finding ways to match various systems with the energy needs of any given machine. Radios and small lights require relatively small wattage, but current human-powered generators could not be easily used to run the family television. The Seiko Kinetic Auto Relay Watch is a particularly good fit between the energy harvesting ability of the device and the wattage it requires. All the wearer has to do is move, and the watch works.</p>
        <p>Human power also lends itself to products like toys; to a land mine detector that Freeplay is developing with Battelle, a military product developer; and to a variety of transportation alternatives. In addition to the commonplace, like bicycles and rowboats, the human-powered transportation found on various Web sites includes four-wheel bikes that drive like cars, landrowers (a tricycle that is powered by pulling on the handlebars), watercycles and submarines.  One of the oddest sites features a human-powered ornithopter, which perfectly captures the slightly kooky nature of using the human body to power other devices. It raises the ancient -- and some would argue, answered -- question, Can we fly with human-powered flapping?</p>
