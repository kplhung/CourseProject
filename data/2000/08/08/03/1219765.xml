        <p>The purpose of a political convention used to be to select a presidential candidate. That ended a generation ago, but three other purposes remained:</p>
        <p>First was to have the party identify what it stood for, as state leaders and national candidates hammered out internal compromises on the anvil of the party platform.</p>
        <p>Next was to draw a sharp contrast with the policies and priorities of the other party. The final purpose of a convention, especially in modern times, has been to enable candidates to introduce themselves to a national audience. In this vital showcase of acceptance, the chosen leader is supposed to unify his party and, with the nation paying attention, smite the political foe and present his own vision.</p>
        <p>But this week we are enduring a non-political political convention. No contesting views means no news; this leads to less coverage and diminishing interest. What is politics without the clash of ideas? What's the use of a great political showcase without a partisan show?</p>
        <p>By vitiating the first two purposes of a convention -- no internal dissent allowed, and then no external issues clearly drawn with the opposition -- George W. Bush offers voters in a prosperous time little compelling reason to switch control of the White House. That, in turn, undercuts his ability to showcase both what's in his heart and what's on his mind.</p>
        <p>Here is the tactical reason Bush operatives give for repressing internal G.O.P. dissent: If, for example, the anti-abortion plank had been amended to make it palatable to most Republican voters, pro-life absolutists in at least seven states would have triggered a floor fight. That would have negatively dominated news of the convention as well as alienated the ''base.'' (By such hardball did Pat Robertson get his payoff and do the Democrats keep their powerful gender-gap issue.)</p>
        <p>But what of the traditional role of the party out of the White House in carrying the battle to the Ins?</p>
        <p>Again, the tactical, practical reasoning: Voters are turned off by partisan bickering. Because impeachment was not popular, overt criticism of any Clinton scandal, from lying under oath to illegal Asian fund-raising, is taboo. The only permitted reference is oblique: women speakers talk of ''restoring respect'' or promise Bush will ''tell the truth,'' allowing alert viewers to impute dishonor or untruthfulness to the White House incumbent, whatsisname.</p>
        <p>This oratorical delicacy averts the dreaded ''mean-spiritedness,'' which pollsters say is death to a candidate. And because Pat Buchanan's diatribe at the 1992 Republican convention declaring cultural war helped elect Bill Clinton, managers of this convention of consensus continue to overreact, insisting on only sweetness and light, patriotic fervor and passion-free compassion.</p>
        <p>That's why we saw Colin Powell limit himself to a single sentence of party irregularity, and watched a wistful John McCain, in a moving expression of loyalty to country and party, ignore the campaign finance issue on which he campaigned. It was left to Dick Cheney to save the day for partisanship -- which he did.</p>
        <p>By suppressing internal dissent on the platform and about primary reform, and by muting vigorous criticism of Democratic policy, the G.O.P. -- except for Cheney -- drained its 2000 convention of vitality.</p>
        <p>My right-wing brethren are loath to knock this. Because Clinton stole conservatives' clothes on curbing welfare and stole swing voters' hearts by harping on hope, many approve stealing the Clinton approach to campaigning.</p>
        <p>But touchy-feely, above-the-battle  mutual back-patting, so universally advised by consultants, smacks of smugness, and calls to mind the candidate atop the wedding cake.</p>
        <p>My ideological allies will say I'm a controversialist who needs a public scrap to sell his wares. (How do they know what's in my heart?)</p>
        <p>Not every expression of outrage at hypocrisy on high is ''the politics of personal destruction.'' Not every wave of media boredom is a ''vast conspiracy'' to deny coverage. Not every reminder of demonstrable lying is ''beating a dead horse.'' Not all spiritedness is mean-spiritedness.</p>
        <p>And if Bush's smiling-in-lockstep strategy backfires, the next G.O.P.  convention may be much livelier.</p>
