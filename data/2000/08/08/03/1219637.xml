        <p>IT was common knowledge in the 1970's that my mother-in-law trafficked in broken Godiva chocolates that she bought in unmarked plastic bags at insanely low prices from an outlet store near her home in Reading, Pa.</p>

        <p>IT was common knowledge in the 1970's that my mother-in-law trafficked in broken Godiva chocolates that she bought in unmarked plastic bags at insanely low prices from an outlet store near her home in Reading, Pa.</p>
        <p>She was the one to see if you wanted chipped dark chocolate leaves, imperfect toffees or cracked pralines. Living at the epicenter of the outlet store revolution that created a national obsession with blemished merchandise, she was also known to lug home bags full of misshapen pretzels, sets of dishes with the glaze marred by air bubbles and Izod shirts whose alligators were missing part of a snout.</p>
        <p>But things went sour over the years as the nature of outlet stores changed. These days you will not find much blemished merchandise. (When I phoned Godiva's outlet store in Reading, the clerk who answered said, ''Oh, no, Godiva does not sell anything imperfect.'') Nor will you find my mother-in-law working the aisles in vain pursuit of partial snouts.</p>
        <p>''Outlets sort of killed themselves, because a lot of manufacturers started to produce a separate lower budget line for the outlets, and suddenly it wasn't so cheap anymore,'' said Christina Lindholm, chairwoman of fashion design and merchandising at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>
        <p>''I haven't seen a genuine outlet in a long time selling stuff that once had been full price, then got marked down, then became truly a bargain,''  Professor Lindholm said.</p>
        <p>Don't bother boarding a bus for a day trip. These days, the best place to shop for old-fashioned, outlet-quality blemished bargains is online, where a growing number of retailers are offering seconds along with factory close-outs and severely marked-down examples of first-quality items that failed to sell in a store.</p>
        <p>From panty hose with an imperfect seam at Onehanesplace.com to baseball bats with a smudged label at Hq4sports.com to computer monitors with a scratch on the case at Surplus-pc.com, you can find examples of almost any category of (legal) merchandise simply by typing ''blemished'' into a search-engine's query box.</p>
        <p>And according to online retailers who sell first-quality merchandise along with blemished products, there is a growing appetite among online shoppers for the slightly imperfect stuff if it is offered at bargain prices.</p>
        <p>''We actually do more business on our seconds page than on our regular site,'' said Steven Kundrat, who sells ethnic musical instruments online at Mid-east.com.</p>
        <p>About 75 percent of the site's retail sales are of blemished instruments, like the sitar with ''finish blemishes,'' priced at $400 plus shipping (compared with $640 for one listed in perfect condition).</p>
        <p>To anyone who lived through the golden age of outlets, the popularity of blemished merchandise online should come as no surprise. But there is an underlying reason for the enduring allure.</p>
        <p>''We're a country of great excess, in all things,'' Professor Lindholm said, ''and the American shopper is very much into quantity and bargains and good deals.''</p>
        <p>But she added that ''many people will not spend very much on any one thing, but overall will end up spending more money than if they had just bought a single good-quality item that they needed.''</p>
        <p>That raises a philosophical question that has been nagging at me since a certain weekend jaunt to Reading in the mid-1980's: Which is better to own, a chipped example of an enormous blue enamel baking dish that you don't need or a mint version of one you actually wanted?</p>
        <p>''A bargain is only a bargain if you need it and can use it,'' Professor Lindholm said (nearly 15 years too late to help me, I might add).</p>
        <p>So if you troll for blemished merchandise online, you should bear a few things in mind:</p>
        <p>* Make sure you really need that extra pair of shoes from Classicpumps.com or that book with a scuffed cover from Bookzone.com or that dented wine rack from Wine racks-unlimited.com.</p>
        <p>* Be fussy as you home in on your quarry. ''If you're going through a bin,'' said Carol Davis, spokeswoman for Onehanesplace.com, ''you can pick the thing up and say, 'Do I really want to live with this color?' But online you don't have that luxury.''</p>
        <p>For that reason, many online retailers will pick through the blemished items for you. ''We don't sell any marginal stuff because of that,'' said Keith Richardson, owner of Sierratradingpost.com, ''and generally the response from customers once they get it is that they can't even find the flaw.'' The company sells both blemished and first-quality name-brand clothing at discounts that typically range from 35 percent to 70 percent off retail.</p>
        <p>The company cuts out the labels from imperfect items from manufacturers like L. L. Bean. ''They're very picky about what merchandise is out there with their name on it,'' Mr. Richardson said.</p>
        <p>* Buy only from sites that clearly describe the imperfection. Sierra tradingpost.com, for example, clearly explains the difference between items described as overstocks and close-outs (''always first quality'') and seconds (''cosmetic blemishes/ irregular'').</p>
        <p>* Before you buy, make sure the site posts a clear return policy. And don't be afraid to ask questions, either by phone or e-mail, before you purchase.</p>
        <p>''I want people to be sure they know what they're buying, so I don't have a shopping basket on the site,'' said Mr. Kundrat of Mid-eastcom. ''We like to talk to the customer on the phone before they place the order.''</p>
        <p>I certainly learned my lesson with the enamel baking dish. I won't buy any more imperfect merchandise unless it serves a genuinely useful, practical purpose.</p>
        <p>And as for my mother-in-law, she went retail.</p>
        <p>Note to Godiva.com: We would both reconsider if you would.</p>
