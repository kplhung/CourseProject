        <p>Voters in Kansas have repudiated the state school board's removal of human evolution from the state science standards, making it all but certain that the decision will be overturned.</p>
        <p>In a Republican primary on Tuesday, the voters defeated three conservative candidates who supported the decision, made by the Kansas Board of Education a year ago. They chose instead, in the first board election since then, three moderate Republicans who pledged to return evolution to the standards. And those three will be running in November against Democrats who hold similar positions.</p>
        <p>As a result, the move to reinstate evolution in the standards will command a majority of the board that takes office in January.</p>
        <p>''I think parents want their kids to have a strong, competitive education,'' Sue Gamble, a moderate Republican, said after defeating a conservative incumbent, Linda Holloway, who was the board's chairwoman when it voted to revise the standards last August. ''The message was that that includes a full set of science standards, and that includes evolution.''</p>
        <p>While the board vote last summer did not bar the teaching of evolution in the schools, it effectively removed evolution as the sole explanation for the origin of species, as well as the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe, from state student assessment tests. Many scientists and educators therefore saw the move as a way to discourage teachers from spending time on those subjects.</p>
        <p>That 6-to-4 decision was considered one of the most significant victories for those who believe that the creation of the species was the work only of God or some ''intelligent designer.'' Proponents of such theories have stepped up their activity in recent years, prompting several states to dilute the teaching of evolution in one way or another. Many other states, wrestling with evolution debates of their own, had their eyes on Kansas as the primary neared.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the evolution issue transformed a usually obscure election  into a race of unusual intensity. Campaigns that typically raise no more than a few hundred dollars received tens of thousands, some from out of state. Candidates even ran television advertisements.</p>
        <p>High-ranking Kansas Republicans got involved in the race, with Gov. Bill Graves endorsing the Republican moderates and Senator Sam Brownback backing the conservatives. And Democrats switched parties just to vote in the Republican primary, which in heavily Republican Kansas often determines November's winner. One Democratic school board member, Bill Wagnon of Topeka, even campaigned for Ms. Gamble, who now faces a Democratic opponent in November.</p>
        <p>Five seats on the 10-member board were at stake on Tuesday. In the end, only one of the four conservatives running against opposition was a winner: Steve Abrams, an incumbent who helped write the new standards. In a fifth district, Mr. Wagnon was unopposed in the Democratic primary and now faces a conservative opponent, who was also unopposed. But whatever the outcome in November, there will be no more than four conservatives on the board.</p>
        <p>Ms. Holloway, the former chairwoman who lost her seat, said she ''had no idea it would be that much of a defeat.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Holloway maintains that evolution can be taught alongside creationism or other beliefs. ''There is clearly still a misunderstanding of what we did,'' she said. ''There is still this stereotype that 'this is religion, and this is science.' It was much more complicated.''</p>
        <p>She blamed ''this elite group in Washington that have an agenda, the National Academy of Sciences and other science groups.''</p>
        <p>Phillip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley who maintains that the universe is so complex that there must have been an ''intelligent designer,'' said: ''I think that the academics and the journalists succeeded pretty well in embarrassing the people of Kansas. And there was a sense that 'people are laughing at us, people think we're rubes, industry doesn't want to come here anymore.' ''</p>
        <p>''This is very heavy-handed intimidation,'' Professor Johnson said.</p>
        <p>In the wake of the board's decision last summer, some districts reacted by considering the teaching of creationism, and some teachers who already favored the teaching of alternatives to evolution felt emboldened.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, though, districts vowed to teach evolution only, and in  Kansas and across the country, their allies rejoiced today.</p>
        <p>''I am relieved, and I'm also thinking that we're back on the road to reality and sanity,'' said Al Frisby, a biology teacher at Shawnee Mission Northwest High School in the Kansas City suburbs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frisby said that as a result of the new standards, ''my life turned upside down.'' In the past, when students or parents mentioned creationism and objected to the teaching of evolution, he could always say that ''the State of Kansas wants us to teach this because it's on the assessment test.''</p>
        <p>Without that rationale, Mr. Frisby had to innovate in his classes. He had students find colored toothpicks he had hidden in the grass and pick them up with plastic knives, forks and spoons. (They learned, for example, that red toothpicks had a smaller chance of ''survival'' because they stood out more than green toothpicks, and that people with forks scoop up fewer toothpicks than those with spoons, an analogy to the process of natural selection.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Frisby joined the American Civil Liberties Union and Kansas Citizens for Science, a group formed to fight the new standards. He even went to a forum on creationism, where he asked why, if Adam gave Eve a rib, Eve did not end up with male XY chromosomes.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Frisby wore a tie that summed up his feelings. It featured three see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil monkeys, with hands covering the eyes, ears or mouth. A fourth monkey's mouth was agape.</p>
        <p>''I feel like the first three monkeys represent the conservative school board members,'' he said. ''They had their eyes closed, they had their ears closed, they had an agenda they were trying to follow. And I'm the monkey at the bottom, saying, 'Wow, it's remarkable.' ''</p>
