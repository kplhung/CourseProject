        <p>These are complicated times for social conservatives.

        <p>There was, unmistakably, a wave of grumbling in the conservative ranks -- about the shortage of strong conservative voices on the stage, about the convention speech awarded to an openly gay member of Congress, about the lack of a stronger and more direct condemnation of the Clinton-Gore administration.

        <p>These are complicated times for social conservatives. They feel they are winning on their core issues at this Republican National Convention, but some of them clearly miss the red-meat rhetoric and partisan edge of conventions past, replaced this week by the Bush campaign's relentless appeal to the center.</p>
        <p>There was, unmistakably, a wave of grumbling in the conservative ranks -- about the shortage of strong conservative voices on the stage, about the convention speech awarded to an openly gay member of Congress, about the lack of a stronger and more direct condemnation of the Clinton-Gore administration. Delegates reacted with pure pleasure tonight to the partisan nature of Dick Cheney's speech.</p>
        <p>But inside the conservative movement, as in the Republican Party more broadly, there is an overriding desire to win in November. So social conservatives are focusing on the victories of Philadelphia; notably, a strong anti-abortion platform and the selection of a running mate, Mr.  Cheney, who is a staunch anti-abortion conservative.</p>
        <p>Some argue that the Bush campaign has merely repackaged core conservatism into a more inclusive appeal; others say that they may well have to remind Gov. George W. Bush of his conservative commitments once he is elected; all agree, passionately, that he is infinitely better than Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>So the Rev. Jerry Falwell and other leaders were putting out word that it was time to hold ranks, maintain discipline and help Mr. Bush win.</p>
        <p>''Some of our people have just got to grow up,'' said Mr. Falwell, when asked about the grumbling in an interview today. ''We have a platform that is strongly pro-life, pro-family, pro-strong national defense. We have a presidential candidate and a vice-presidential candidate, both of whom are pro-life, pro-family and pro-strong national defense.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''Our crowd needs to get into the battle, keep their mouths shut and help this man win.''</p>
        <p>Chuck Sigerson, chairman of the Nebraska Republican Party and a longtime member of the Christian Coalition, noted: ''You know, in 1992, all the left-wing Democrats were mad at Bill Clinton. They didn't like a lot of the things that Bill Clinton stood for because he was a New Democrat. But what did they do?  They shut up, because they knew that although he was not as left wing as them, at least they thought not, they knew if he got elected they could still get most of their programs through.  And they did.''</p>
        <p>The unease among some social conservatives bubbled up on the convention floor on Tuesday night when a small group of Texas delegates protested in silent prayer while Representative Jim Kolbe of Arizona, who is gay, spoke on trade. Cathie Adams, president of the conservative Texas Eagle Forum and one of those protesting delegates, said that Mr. Kolbe's selection was ''all about affirmative action.'' She added, alluding to social conservatives: ''We're not the favored sons. That's very apparent and that makes me sad.'' But she made it clear that she would work hard for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Colleen Parro, director of the Republican National Coalition for Life, said of the Kolbe choice, ''If they wanted diversity, why didn't they ask Alan Keyes to speak?'' Mr. Keyes, who was a contender in the Republican primaries, is black and staunchly conservative.</p>
        <p>And Chuck Donovan, acting president of the conservative Family Research Council, described the media presentation of the proceedings this week as a ''Sally Field convention:  'You love me; you really love me.' ''  But he quickly added: ''In terms of substantive action, the platform and the choice of Cheney, social conservatives have every reason to be pleased. And if you've got to choose something, take the substance over the symbol.''</p>
        <p>Once Mr. Bush is elected, Mr. Donovan added, ''We'll certainly be there with the fire that's in the platform and say, 'This is the fire we're going to hold your feet to.' ''</p>
        <p>The Family Research Council gave the platform good grades for reasserting the party's opposition to legalized abortion, its endorsement of tax cuts, its defense of traditional marriage and its declaration that homosexuality is ''incompatible'' with military service.</p>
        <p>Ralph Reed, a former executive director of the Christian Coalition and now a top Bush adviser, said in an interview today that ''social conservatives have become increasingly mature and sophisticated about the political process and understand that a political party is not a church, and that becoming a governing majority requires that you work with others with whom you occasionally disagree. And if there wasn't a full understanding of that 8 or 10 years ago, there certainly is now.''</p>
        <p>Eight years out of power have certainly fueled the social conservatives' political pragmatism. Mr. Falwell said, ''There's no question that the Clinton-Gore philosophy has lowered the moral bar in this country, almost irreparably.''</p>
        <p>At a crowded rally on Tuesday at a downtown hotel, Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, highlighted the stakes for religious conservatives in the election, focusing on the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''Five people can decide the destiny of unborn children,'' Mr. Robertson thundered. ''Five people can decide whether we can pray or not pray.'' He added, ''It looks as if two or three of those unelected officials are getting ready to retire or go on up to that great court in the sky.''</p>
        <p>Vowing a renewed coalition campaign this fall, with 75 million voting guides distributed by churches, he told a cheering audience, ''We need to have the election of a man who will appoint righteous judges to the court of the United States.''</p>
        <p>The paramount importance of the abortion issue was cited again and again by social conservatives this week. Well before he had the nomination, Mr. Bush signaled that he would support the Republican platform's abortion plank, which calls for a ban on the procedure without exception, and the appointment of judges who support the ''sanctity of innocent human life.'' Mr. Bush, however, says he personally would allow abortion in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman is in danger.</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Bush says he does not have a litmus test for the appointment of judges, a New York Times/ CBS News poll in late July showed that conservative Republicans overwhelmingly expected him to appoint Supreme Court justices who would vote against abortion rights.</p>
        <p>Carol Tobias, political director of the National Right to Life Committee, said, ''We're really very pleased with the way things are going.''</p>
        <p>Asked about the scant mention of abortion from the podium, she replied: ''We're keeping everything in perspective. We got the important things, and we're very happy.''</p>
