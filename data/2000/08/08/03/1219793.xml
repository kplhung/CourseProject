        <p>Hotjobs.com, the job-search Web site, is awarding its creative assignment, with billings estimated at $30 million to $40 million, to Weiss Stagliano Partners in New York.</p>
        <p>The previous creative agency, handling those duties since early 1999, was the Troy, Mich., office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. McCann described its parting with Hotjobs.com as mutual.</p>
        <p>''Weiss Stagliano understands the Hotjobs brand, who we are and who we need to be,'' Marc Karasu, who recently joined Hotjobs.com in New York as advertising director, said yesterday. Mr Karasu added that Hotjobs.com, which advertised during the last two Super Bowls, was ''considering'' buying time during Super Bowl XXXV in January 2001. TBS Media Management in New York continues as the media services agency. The decision came after a monthlong review that had been narrowed to Weiss Stagliano and two other finalists, Mr. Karasu said, identifying them as the New York offices of Fallon Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe, and TBWA/Chiat/ Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>Carl Johnson, president and chief executive at TBWA/Chiat/Day New York, said yesterday that his agency had withdrawn from the Hotjobs.com review before the final decision ''to put our hat in the ring for Monster.com.'' That company, a job-search Web site owned by TMP Worldwide, began a review last month for its domestic account, with billings estimated at $75 million to $90 million.</p>
