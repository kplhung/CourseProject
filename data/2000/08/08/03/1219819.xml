        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your July 29 editorial ''Copyright in the Age of Napster,'' about legal issues raised by the Web site:</p>
        <p>Most music is never played on the radio. Unless we have a legal opportunity to hear that music in its entirety, how on earth do the music executives and artists expect us to buy it, or even to know it exists? I resent that I am forced to break copyright laws just for the privilege of listening before I buy.</p>

I resent that I am forced to break copyright laws just for the privilege of listening before I buy.</p>
        <p>For me, Napster has been a breath of fresh air. My purchase of music has more than tripled since I began downloading songs, all from artists who get little or no airplay where I live.</p>
        <p>We've heard so much about the rights of the music industry to control its music.</p>
        <p>What about the rights of the consumers to know what they're buying? After all, you can't return a CD after it's opened.</p>
