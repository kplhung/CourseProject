        <p>Cable television networks are increasingly turning to original dramatic films and series to expand and solidify their audiences as broadcast networks venture into 'reality' and quiz shows, once the province of cable networks; HBO, Showtime, TNT, Lifetime and A&amp;E, which led the way, are now being joined by FX, MTV, VH-1 and E! Entertainment and even ESPN; photos (M)</p>

        <p>FX is one of those cable networks that many channel surfers glide past because it offers reruns of enduring hits like ''N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' ''The X-Files'' and ''Married with Children.''</p>
        <p>But Peter Liguori, president of FX Networks, which is owned by the News Corporation, said that like other cable stations, FX was trying to get more attention and reinvent itself in the face of an increasingly competitive network arena obsessed with reality programs like CBS's ''Survivor'' and quiz shows like ABC's ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire.''</p>

        <p>FX is one of those cable networks that many channel surfers glide past because it offers reruns of enduring hits like ''N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' ''The X-Files'' and ''Married with Children.''</p>
        <p>But Peter Liguori, president of FX Networks, which is owned by the News Corporation, said that like other cable stations, FX was trying to get more attention and reinvent itself in the face of an increasingly competitive network arena obsessed with reality programs like CBS's ''Survivor'' and quiz shows like ABC's ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>''Original television movies are now being minimized in the world of the networks,'' Mr. Liguori said. ''This opens up opportunities in the world of basic cable to fill the void.''</p>
        <p>The result is a provocative FX drama, ''Deliberate Intent,'' which will have its premiere at 8 p.m. Sunday, the first dramatic film on a network not known for original films.</p>
        <p>FX is hardly alone. MTV, VH-1 and E! Entertainment -- which are known for their music videos, lightweight interviews and documentaries -- are joining the ranks of HBO, Showtime, TNT, Lifetime, A&amp;E and other stations in the quest for audiences seeking dramatic films and series. ESPN, the sports network, is also considering making dramatic films.</p>
        <p>The reason is straightforward: cable  networks like MTV and E! want to solidify and expand their audiences by moving into new areas like dramatic shows.</p>
        <p>''It's ironic that cable and the broadcast networks are coming from different directions and moving toward the middle -- the broadcast networks once had scripted and fiction shows and are now moving towards the reality side, while the cable networks are moving from reality to fiction,'' said Mindy Herman, president and chief executive of E! Networks, which is planning 10 to 15 series and 4 to 6 films a year.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Brian Graden, president of programming at MTV, said the network was adding dramatic shows and series to its mix of music videos and interviews, largely aimed at 12- to 24-year-olds. Starting at 10 p.m. on Wednesday, MTV will offer a 13-part series called ''Live Through This,'' a multigenerational drama about a reunited rock band of the 70's that goes back on tour accompanied by their teen-age children.</p>
        <p>''We're certainly crossing the line, creating dramas and series around music,'' Mr. Graden said. ''MTV is such a special brand that as the head programmer, I want to take it slowly. We don't want to put all our eggs in one basket. Our model is HBO. I want to make sure that we don't end up as a traditional television channel.''</p>
        <p>Home Box Office, under its former chairman, Michael Fuchs, began making films and series in 1983, serving as a model for other cable networks. (HBO's first film was ''The Terry Fox Story,'' about a one-legged runner, and its first series was ''Not Necessarily the News,'' with news clips in sketch comedy).</p>
        <p>Though the broadcast networks are still dominant, in recent years they have been envious of and a little irritated by HBO's success with free-wheeling shows like ''The Sopranos'' and ''Sex in the City,'' which have few constraints on language and sex and are the darlings of critics. Last year, despite 16 nominations, ''The Sopranos'' did not win the best dramatic series award at the Emmys, which has been taken as a sign of resentment toward HBO for its daring treatment of sex and language. Instead, ''The Practice'' on ABC won for the second straight year.</p>
        <p>For the cable networks, the risks of competing in this new arena are largely financial. A two-hour drama on cable often costs $3 million to $5 million and sometimes much more. A reality show may cost $200,000. The payoff in producing dramatic shows, they hope, is higher advertising rates and larger audiences.</p>
        <p>''The risk is that these are expensive pieces of programming, and we know how difficult the movie business is,'' Mr. Liguori said . ''What you hope to do is make intelligent bets and promote them wisely. It's a high-risk reward for cable to do this, while traditional networks are squeezing back on writing and storytelling and heavying up on reality.''</p>
        <p>Beyond this, there's a more intangible risk for some cable networks. ''If you don't create the right type of movie or drama and you are a very branded channel like VH-1 or MTV or ESPN, then you risk watering down your brand by providing the wrong type of product,'' said Jeffrey Gaspin, executive vice president of programming and production at VH-1. ''So our movies are about music.''</p>
        <p>The VH-1 films have been about the lives of the Monkees, about the performer Meat Loaf and about Ricky Nelson.</p>
        <p>To writers and directors struggling in the face of diminishing numbers of dramas and series on network television, the entry of cable into the arena is clearly a boon. FX, for example, plans four films a year.</p>
        <p>''It opens up a whole new world of venues where you can tell stories that in some cases are edgy and will get attention and are certainly not what the networks are doing,'' said Andy Wolk, the director and co-author, with Lisa Mohan, of the adaptation of ''Deliberate Intent.'' The harrowing legal drama is based on a book by Rodney A. Smolla, a First Amendment lawyer and expert on Constitutional law.</p>
        <p>The drama is a true story about a hit man hired by a former Motown record executive to kill his ex-wife, their paraplegic son and a nurse for insurance money that paid for the boy's medical care. In murdering the three, the killer meticulously used the details provided in a mail-order book called ''Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors,'' published by Paladin Press. The result was a lawsuit against Paladin Press and its owner, Peder Lund, a former Green Beret.</p>
        <p>The cast includes Timothy Hutton as Mr. Smolla, who represented the plaintiffs -- the victims' family -- in the groundbreaking lawsuit. Other members of the cast include Ron Rifkin as another family lawyer and two well-known television actors, James McDaniel of ''N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' who plays the former Motown executive, and Clark Johnson of ''Homicide,'' who plays the killer for hire.</p>
        <p>Other networks joining the drama bandwagon include E!, which has completed four films so far. One, ''Best Actress,'' a drama about Oscar contenders, was presented last year about the time of the Academy Award ceremonies. Another, ''Becoming Dick,'' about a Hollywood actor who realizes that the only way to succeed is to turn into a jerk, will be shown on Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>Ms. Herman, the president of E!, said that one factor easily overlooked is what she calls the halo effect. ''Doing these movies does have an effect on your brand and your position in the marketplace,'' Ms. Herman said. ''When you launch these shows, you get higher ratings. You get more press and publicity. It creates a halo for your network that hopefully trickles down to the other shows you have.'' She added: ''Ten years ago HBO was the archetype network when they started doing movies. It added a certain cachet. We're learning from that.''</p>
        <p>Jeff Bewkes, HBO's chairman, said his network was not troubled by the trend of cable networks to move into films and dramatic series. Over the last two years TNT and Showtime have sought to compete with HBO: TNT last year announced a schedule heavy on classics like ''Animal Farm,'' ''Don Quixote'' and ''David Copperfield.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bewkes said that the many cable networks creating feature film and series ''should actually reinvigorate these genres.''</p>
        <p>''They're right to do this, and I'm not surprised it's happening,'' he said. ''A network needs to have distinct programming. And movies and series are a way of doing that.'' He added that HBO did not view just other cable networks as competition. ''NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox are our competition too,'' he said.</p>
