        <p>Composure was the last thing anyone wanted from Einsturzende Neubauten on Tuesday at Irving Plaza. Nonetheless, that's what this German band first offered. The sextet stood motionless, surrounded by its instruments, many fashioned from steel blades and industrial tools. Blixa Bargeld, the group's handsomely cadaverous singer, sucked smoke from his cigarette and sighed, ''Silence is sexy.'' Everyone paused. Then the clanging began.</p>
        <p>When Neubauten emerged 20 years ago, all most people heard was clanging. With a name that means collapsing new buildings and a tendency to combust onstage, Neubauten was one of the world's most shocking bands. Its mostly improvised, highly cacophonous performances left listeners with ringing ears and astounded minds.</p>

        <p>Composure was the last thing anyone wanted from Einsturzende Neubauten on Tuesday at Irving Plaza. Nonetheless, that's what this German band first offered. The sextet stood motionless, surrounded by its instruments, many fashioned from steel blades and industrial tools. Blixa Bargeld, the group's handsomely cadaverous singer, sucked smoke from his cigarette and sighed, ''Silence is sexy.'' Everyone paused. Then the clanging began.</p>
        <p>When Neubauten emerged 20 years ago, all most people heard was clanging. With a name that means collapsing new buildings and a tendency to combust onstage, Neubauten was one of the world's most shocking bands. Its mostly improvised, highly cacophonous performances left listeners with ringing ears and astounded minds.</p>
        <p>Much has changed, however. The Berlin Wall's fall has transformed Germany. The musical dominion that includes Neubauten has also opened up; industrial music, which the band pioneered, now touches heavy metal, techno and even hip-hop. As heavy music has grown more prevalent, Neubauten has softened. Its latest album, the double-disc ''Silence is Sexy'' (Mute), is tuneful, funny and melancholy, but not so jarring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bargeld and his mates showed no anxiety about these changes. The tools still gleamed from the stage: a tight row of working saw blades, sheets of metal, heavy chains, sculptural cymbals, vibrators, an air compressor and the Noodle, a giant one-stringed instrument fashioned from a pipe, deployed by N. U. Unruh and Rudolph Moser, the two percussionists. They banged away often enough, but also wrung sweetness from those alloys, making the blades sound like bells or the sheet metal undulate.</p>
        <p>The music's dynamic range was enhanced by the steady low bass of Alexander Hacke, the band's powerful anchor, and the delicate manipulations of the guitarist, Jochen Arbeit. These players sometimes used pipes and vibrating appliances to produce fantastic sounds, but they never lost control of their effects, although at times the songs rambled into abstraction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bargeld played host in this sound gallery. In German or English, he intoned very literary lyrics about phantom lovers, death's specter and the perils of totalitarianism. Mr. Bargeld's decadent style made him seem like a Weimar dandy except when he let forth his shriek, a highly controlled, otherworldy wail two octaves above his normal range. As the rhythm bursting from Neubauten's doctored machinery took over, the music went from dry to visceral.</p>
        <p>Even at its most assaultive, Neubauten's music remained fundamentally cerebral. The brain is a physical organ too, of course, as the band reminded the audience in an extended version of its classic meltdown, ''Headcleaner.'' As the music surged and retreated, Mr. Bargeld turned the Beatles song ''All You Need Is Love'' into a demonic incantation. It was a particularly clear example of Neubauten's gift for pummeling expectations into submission, as the musicians did with the metal from which they wring sweetness.</p>
