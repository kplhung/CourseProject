        <p>South Africa's minister of safety and security has ordered an indefinite moratorium on the release of crime statistics, saying the system for collecting such information here in one of the world's most crime-plagued countries is flawed and unreliable.</p>
        <p>After reportedly denying plans for a moratorium -- an idea unpopular with some legislators and specialists -- the minister, Steve Tshwete, and the national police commissioner, Jackie Selebi, have in the last week reversed themselves and acknowledged the decision.</p>
        <p>Mr. Selebi, the first black commissioner to lead the 120,000-member national police service, has been the man in the spotlight on crime, beginning a national initiative, called Operation Crackdown, in April, three months after taking office. But the quick results he promised have yet to materialize.</p>
        <p>Many of the critics concede that methods for collecting and analyzing crime statistics are problematic; they support the work of a task force that began meeting this week to work out a plan for correcting the problems.</p>
        <p>But some also argue that keeping the public in the dark about crime rates for months is questionable.</p>
        <p>''They say, 'We know the statistics are flawed and we're going to correct them,' '' said Eric Pelser, who studies the South African Police Service for the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria. ''At the same time they have a crime control strategy that is dependent on these statistics.''</p>
        <p>Few of the country's problems have done more to discourage foreign investment and international tourism than the high rate of violent crime.</p>
        <p>Carjackings and other types of robberies, widely considered a barometer of personal safety, have climbed steadily since 1994, according to the last crime statistics released by the police before the moratorium took effect this month.</p>
        <p>The murder rate has declined in  the last five years, to 55.3 per 100,000 in 1999 from 69.3 per 100,000 in 1994, according to an analysis by the Institute for Security Studies. But it remains among the highest in the world, and much of the decrease has been attributed to the gradual falloff in politically motivated killings that racked the country in the mid-1990's, during the transition to black-majority rule.</p>
        <p>The commissioner's spokeswoman, Sally De Beer, insisted that he was not ''covering up or trying to clamp down on bad news.'' ''Commissioner Selebi uses these crime statistics to plan operations and to deploy personnel, and he doesn't want to plan his operation on what could be faulty data,'' she said.</p>
