      <abstract>
        <p>Letter from Peg Breen of New York Landmarks Conservancy deplores Congress's passage of Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act without hearings (July 27 editorial)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your July 27 editorial ''Religion and Its Landmarks'' was on the mark calling for Congressional hearings on the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. While there were prior hearings on a much broader version of this bill, there has never been a fair representation of witnesses questioning the bill's constitutionality, necessity and effect. Unfortunately, the bill has since passed -- without hearings and without debate.</p>
        <p>The Landmarks Conservancy has helped more than 1,000 religious institutions throughout the state over the last 14 years. We have never seen evidence of a need for a sweeping bill of this type, and we have seen many examples where solutions to zoning or landmark issues were successfully resolved at the local level.</p>

        <p>New York City cannot pass legislation without proper public input. The same standard should apply to Congress.</p>
