        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Behind the Music: Organs Go Electronic'' (July 27) was a well-researched and fair appraisal of the controversy over using electronic sounds for some or all of the sound of an organ. For years there were builders of genuine pipe organs and makers of electronic imitations. The distinction was clear.</p>
        <p>One of the cleverest ploys of the imitation manufacturers was to foster the merging of the genuine and the imitation in the same instrument, suggesting to the world at large that both are artistic equals. The unpleasant fact is that pipe organ builders on the down-market side of the field welcome the marriage of the artificial and the genuine because there are always clients who are eager to have more for less. Meanwhile, the preferred builders of pipe organs, both in Europe and North America, usually have long waiting lists and need make no compromises.</p>

        <p>The technology for electronic sound production, though indisputably improved in the last couple of decades, is changing fast and therefore prone to rapid obsolescence. The union of this obsolescence with the proven longevity of the traditional craft is an unhappy one.</p>
