        <p>Ireland's largest bank, Allied Irish Banks, reported a 12 percent increase in first-half earnings to 480 million Irish pounds, or $562 million, on the strength of its business in the booming domestic economy and demand for financial services in Poland, where the bank has significant operations through its ownership of Bank Zachodni. But a cloud hangs over the bank because of an inquiry by Ireland's tax authorities into whether it owes taxes on bogus nonresident accounts, which analysts speculate could exceed 100 million Irish pounds, or $117 million.</p>
