        <p>In a murder case that drew national attention but seemed to be growing colder by the month, the police have charged two men with the fatal stabbing of Amy Watkins, a 26-year-old graduate student, on a Brooklyn street a year and a half ago.</p>
        <p>The man who police say did the stabbing, David Jamison, 27, admitted his role in the killing in a videotaped statement and was charged with first-degree murder, a senior law enforcement official said.</p>
        <p>The other man, Felix Rodriguez, 20, was charged with second-degree murder because he helped Mr. Jamison rob Ms. Watkins and the robbery led to her murder, said Sgt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman. Both men were also charged with first-degree robbery and weapons possession.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jamison has a record of more than half a dozen arrests, mostly for petty crimes and drugs and once for robbery, the police said. He was arrested yesterday about 11 a.m. at his home, 126 Sterling Place in Park Slope, mere blocks from where the stabbing took place.</p>
        <p>A third man, Pierre Antoinne, 26, an unemployed house painter, was being questioned by the police, his relatives said yesterday. In his statement, Mr. Jamison said that the two men were present during the robbery and killing, law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>After the stabbing, on Park Place in Prospect Heights on March 9, 1999, the police were left with a highly publicized crime and few clues. There were no known witnesses, and because the killer had apparently concealed the large carving knife in a white plastic bag during the attack, no fingerprints were left behind.</p>
        <p>More than six months after the robbery and killing of Ms. Watkins, who had moved to New York from Kansas to attend the Hunter College Graduate School of Social Work, investigators reported that despite thousands of hours of work, their leads had dwindled to zero. Their only hope was that the killer would turn himself in, commit another crime in front of witnesses or tell someone about the stabbing. A $10,000 reward went unclaimed.</p>
        <p>The police said that hundreds of people had been questioned,  but that Mr. Jamison's name had never come up. At various times, the police theorized that the crime could have been committed by a homeless man or someone who knew her, according to a senior investigator.</p>
        <p>Finally, detectives got a break, an investigator said yesterday: in recent days, Mr. Jamison talked about the case, and word got back to detectives through an informant in another part of the city and a tip to the police Crime Stoppers hot line.</p>
        <p>News of Mr. Jamison's arrest came as a surprise to Ms. Watkins's friends and family, many of whom said they had given up hope that the killer would be found.</p>
        <p>''I think we'll have feelings of reawakened grief,'' said Lawrence Watkins, her father, a history teacher at the Dominican Academy on East 68th Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Adam Green, Ms. Watkins's boyfriend at the time of her death, said he had moved out of the neighborhood where she was killed. He said he had thought the police would never find a suspect. ''A good part of me hoped it would stay that way,'' he said. ''I was not in need of a name and a face, because that wasn't going to change anything for me.''</p>
        <p>In its brutality and apparent randomness, the killing of Ms. Watkins was the kind of homicide that had become increasingly startling with the declines in reported crime in New York City. That was one reason  it drew national attention and tabloid headlines. Ms. Watkins's dedication to helping others, particularly women who were victims of violence, and the shock that the killing sent through the newly gentrified area near Prospect Park made the story even more compelling.</p>
        <p>On that cold March night, Ms. Watkins, described by a classmate as ''a soldier of social work,'' was on her way home from the Bronx Community Center where she worked with battered women. As she walked down her quiet street, neighbors heard two screams, and found her less than two blocks from her apartment with a knife in her back, surrounded by fallen groceries. Her purse was later found near Washington Avenue.</p>
        <p>The police said their initial suspicion, that the motive was robbery, was borne out yesterday.</p>
        <p>Detectives John Barber and Robert Rivera were able to draw the confession out of Mr. Jamison, an investigator said.</p>
        <p>According to his statement, investigators said, he and the two other men were sitting in a luncheonette on the southeast corner of Flatbush Avenue and Park Place when they saw Ms. Watkins walk by laden with shopping bags and decided she would be ''an easy mark.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jamison approached Ms. Watkins from behind while, investigators believe, the two other men were in front of her. After Mr. Jamison stabbed her, the three fled in different directions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jamison apparently claimed to police that the stabbing was unintentional. ''He's got some story that she moved backwards onto the knife,'' a senior investigator said, ''which is inconsistent with the wounds.''</p>
        <p>Three relatives of the men who were waiting in the lobby of the 77th Precinct station house last night said the men had nothing to do with the murder.</p>
        <p>Veronica Corea, 25, Mr. Jamison's sister-in-law and Mr. Rodriguez's sister, acknowledged that Mr. Jamison had been in trouble with the law -- he has prior arrests for robbery, petty larceny and drug-dealing -- but she said that he was not violent.</p>
        <p>''Everyone makes a lot of mistakes, but he would never take it to that level,'' she said. ''Just because a brother hangs out in the street and smokes a little weed, he's a killer? Come on.''</p>
        <p>Ms. West, a cashier at the Yankee Stadium box office, said that her brother was not capable of murder.</p>
        <p>''He's an idiot and a moron, but he wouldn't be able to do that,'' she said. ''If you knew my brother, he's a real coward. He doesn't have the heart to do that.''</p>
        <p>The police had said that Mr. Rodriguez, a warehouse worker who lives on Prospect Place not far from the murder site, was talking to investigators last night, but that Mr. Antoinne was not. Mr. Antoinne, a Haitian national, began serving a state prison term for an attempted drug sale in 1995. On Jan. 25, 1996, state records indicate, he was paroled to the United States immigration service. A police investigator said that Mr. Antoinne might have been deported to Haiti under a special program and then might have returned, on his own and illegally, to the United States.</p>
        <p>When the stabbing occurred, it drew focus to a rapidly changing  neighborhood. Some said that professionals who had recently moved to Prospect Heights had chosen to overlook the rougher areas of the neighborhood at their peril.</p>
        <p>But old residents as well as new mourned the loss of Ms. Watkins.</p>
        <p>Janet Abdelmegeed, 47, a waitress who has lived for 13 years in the building where Mr. Jamison was arrested, said yesterday that she was shocked to learn that a neighbor was a suspect in the killing. She said she had attended a candlelight vigil for Ms. Watkins. ''I remember when that little girl died,'' she said. ''Who couldn't cry over that?''</p>
