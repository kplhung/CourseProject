        <p>Senator Mitch McConnell, the chairman of the Republican Senate campaign, was introducing the party's candidates for open seats at a luncheon here today. He pointed to John Ensign of Nevada, Bill McCollum of Florida and Don Stenberg of Nebraska, and then searched the room.</p>
        <p>''Is anyone else here?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>''Bob Franks!'' shouted the men from New Jersey, sitting near their overlooked friend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks has had that kind of week.</p>
        <p>The Republican National Convention was supposed to be a chance for Mr. Franks, a four-term congressman from northern New Jersey with a low profile even in his home state, to grab some needed attention for his underdog Senate campaign against Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic multimillionaire who spent $35 million of his own money in the primary alone.</p>
        <p>But on Monday, when Mr. Franks was to give his three-minute speech from the convention floor, the daily schedule had him listed as Gary Franks of Connecticut, who is not even a congressman anymore. Mr. Franks humbly began his remarks -- a biting attack on Mr. Corzine, who he said ''makes Ted Kennedy look like Barry Goldwater'' -- by acknowledging his own obscurity: ''You don't know me, but you probably have heard of my opponent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks's turn at the podium might have received a fair amount of attention in the New Jersey news media, always hungry for a local angle. But at about the time he was speaking, Senator Robert G. Torricelli was abandoning the Democratic race for New Jersey governor. So Mr. Franks found himself quoted, if at all, in stories about other people.</p>
        <p>At least his fund-raising efforts have not been fruitless. Monday night, Mr. Franks was the guest of honor at a $1,000-a-person party -- all that for hot dogs and an open bar -- aboard a Cape May ferry that had made a detour to Camden. The event raised more than $100,000, Mr. Franks said.</p>
        <p>And this morning, Mr. Franks was introduced by former Senator Bob Dole at a mixer of big-ticket contributors organized by the Republican Leadership Council, a group that helps finance moderate candidates.</p>
        <p>''We just picked up another 15 to 25 checks,'' Mr. Franks said as he emerged from the hotel suite.</p>
        <p>More important, Mr. Franks and his finance director, Laura Slomka, have been networking with party rainmakers in California, Connecticut, Florida and elsewhere to hold fund-raisers for the Franks campaign in the next several weeks. The first two, in Dallas and Houston, will be given by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, he said.</p>
        <p>The next month or so will be critical for Mr. Franks, whose aides say he must raise $8 million to $10 million to stand a chance against Mr. Corzine. So at every opportunity, he is reminding listeners of Mr. Corzine's liberal platform and even more liberal campaign spending.</p>
        <p>''That's the lens through which people outside of New Jersey are looking at this race,'' he said. ''I can get up there and blah-blah about the marriage penalty, or I can get their attention for 180 seconds and establish the stark contrast between Jon Corzine and Bob Franks, the Republican they've never heard of.''</p>
