        <p>The Supreme Court of New Jersey upheld the state's death penalty review process today while at the same time finding that it was ''inherently unreliable'' in assessing whether race plays a role in determining who is prosecuted for a capital crime and ultimately sentenced to death.</p>
        <p>Consequently, the court directed that the system of reviewing the role race may play in capital cases be refined with additional and more pointed statistical methods. And the state's high court said that the refining should take place annually.</p>
        <p>The ruling was the broadest among four from the court today that were related to the death penalty. The other three were in individual cases, and the court upheld the death sentence as proper and in proportion to sentences in similar cases.</p>
        <p>But in its more philosophical look at the fairness of how the death penalty is administered, the court had questions.</p>
        <p>''A myriad of discretionary decisions are made at every level in the system,'' the court said in a 5-to-1 ruling approving the changes in the review process, ''and sorting out their relationship to the race of either defendants or victims is complex and difficult. We have learned that statistical modeling for that purpose is largely untested and that its usefulness is uncertain. The improvements and additions we approve today will need further review down the road.''</p>
        <p>The ruling represented a minor but significant change from a 1999 decision upholding the state's review process and finding that systemic racism was not a factor in capital punishment in the state. Today's decision sustained that general ruling, but expressed an interest in delving further into the question of the effect of race in such cases.</p>
        <p>The ruling was applauded by both the state attorney general's office, which defended the review process, and lawyers from the state public defender's office, which challenged it.</p>
        <p>Anne Paskow, chief of the appellate bureau in the state attorney general's office, said the ruling meant that there were no ''racial problems to warrant not going forward'' with executions in the state.</p>
        <p>She noted that in the three other rulings today, the court upheld as proportional the sentences of three men awaiting execution. With these rulings, she said, all 11 death sentences that have gone to the high court for proportionality review since the state reinstated capital punishment in 1982 have been upheld.</p>
        <p>Still, she lamented the fact that the court had rejected the state's argument that no further studies were needed. ''We keep studying the same thing over and over,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But Claudia Van Wyk, chief of the appeals office of the state public defender, said she was ''encouraged that the court is interested in finding out if race really plays a role.''</p>
        <p>There was no such interest in most of the 38 other states with a death penalty, she said, where review processes aimed at determining whether a particular death sentence was in line with other such sentences in similar cases had been scaled back in recent years.</p>
        <p>The death penalties upheld today came in the case of Ambrose Harris, convicted in the 1992 carjacking, rape and murder of Kristin Huggins in Trenton; of Robert W. Morton, in the 1993 death of a Burlington County gas station attendant, Michael Eck, who was stabbed 24 times during a robbery; and of Richard Feaster, in the shotgun murder in 1993 of a gas station attendant, Keith Donaghy, during a robbery.</p>
        <p>In each case, the court found that the penalties were in line with death sentences in similar state cases.</p>
