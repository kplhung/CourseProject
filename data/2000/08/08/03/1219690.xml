        <p>Standard Chartered P.L.C., a London-based bank with most of its operations in Asia, announced a severe global cutback today that will eliminate 5,000 positions, or about 20 percent of the staff, to help lower costs.</p>
        <p>Such cuts, which tend to increase a company's stock price, have been made by other big banks worldwide.

        <p>Standard Chartered P.L.C., a London-based bank with most of its operations in Asia, announced a severe global cutback today that will eliminate 5,000 positions, or about 20 percent of the staff, to help lower costs.</p>
        <p>Such cuts, which tend to increase a company's stock price, have been made by other big banks worldwide. But Standard Chartered's cutback was coupled with an announcement that its earnings in the first half of the year had been lower than expected, and the bank's shares fell here today by more than 10 percent, losing 98 pence to close at $:8.52, or $12.71.</p>
        <p>Standard Chartered said the cost-cutting, to include a streamlining of its data-processing centers, would itself cost $715 million in severance and other expenses. It is projected to produce savings around $105 million next year and $255 million annually from 2003 onward.</p>
        <p>The bank said 6,000 jobs would be eliminated and 1,000 others created. Of the special expenses, about $150 million will be used to integrate Grindlays Bank, which Standard Chartered bought for $1.3 billion in April as part of a planned Asian expansion. The company said the purchase made it the leading international bank in southern Asia.</p>
        <p>Though it does relatively little business in Britain, Standard Chartered has operations in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, India and other parts of Asia, where recovery from the financial crisis of 1997-98 has benefited banks there, such as the rival HSBC, by making it easier for individuals and companies to repay loans.</p>
        <p>But while HSBC reported a better-than-expected increase of 31 percent in its first-half profit this week, Standard Chartered's profit increase seemed less robust. Investors compare the two banks because of their similar emphasis on emerging markets -- shielding them somewhat from the rough-and-tumble competition of retail banking in Britain.</p>
        <p>Standard Chartered said the Asian recovery had allowed it to set aside less money for potential bad debts -- equivalent to $246 million compared with $360 million in the period last year. This saving increased first- half profit 25 percent above the level of a year earlier, to the equivalent of $346 million. Analysts, though, had forecast a 31 percent increase.</p>
        <p>Rana Talwar, the bank's chief executive, maintained that the job cuts had been under consideration for 18 months and would affect personnel throughout the bank's operations. The reductions matched job cuts by banks in the United States, Britain and Germany, reflecting competitive pressure that make traditional banking operations less profitable.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the Bank of America has said that it will reduce its work force by 9,000 to 10,000, and Dresdner Bank of Germany is eliminating 5,000 jobs, or about 10 percent of its work force. Barclays Bank recently stirred protests from British customers and politicians with plans to close scores of small branches.</p>
