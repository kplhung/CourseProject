        <p>General Motors challenged Ford to a battle over which company can deliver bigger improvements in fuel economy, particularly for sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>Ford said last week that it would improve the gas mileage of its sport utility vehicles over the next five years by 25 percent. General Motors responded that no matter how much Ford improved fuel efficiency, G.M.'s vehicles would do even better.</p>
        <p>G.M. also said that the overall fuel economy for all its light trucks -- a category that includes minivans and pickup trucks as well as sport utility vehicles -- would be better than Ford's in 2005.  Business Day, Page C1.</p>
