        <p>Having outrun an attempt by Senator Robert G. Torricelli to sprint past him toward the Democratic nomination for New Jersey governor, Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge took a symbolic victory lap today at a news conference in Trenton, showing off the state and county party leaders who have rallied to his side.</p>
        <p>''This is what unity looks like,'' Mr. McGreevey said as he stood among a group of 50 party leaders and lawmakers who he said represented both South and North Jersey, as well as cities and suburbs.

        <p>Having outrun an attempt by Senator Robert G. Torricelli to sprint past him toward the Democratic nomination for New Jersey governor, Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge took a symbolic victory lap today at a news conference in Trenton, showing off the state and county party leaders who have rallied to his side.</p>
        <p>''This is what unity looks like,'' Mr. McGreevey said as he stood among a group of 50 party leaders and lawmakers who he said represented both South and North Jersey, as well as cities and suburbs. It included Democratic leaders from 16 of 21 counties and many of the party's state legislators.</p>
        <p>The leaders were assembled by the state party chairman, Thomas Giblin, who said that without Mr. Torricelli's potentially divisive efforts for the nomination, the party was stronger.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey, who was the party's nominee in 1997 and lost by a narrow margin to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, had been moving without competition toward the 2001 nomination until a few weeks ago, when Mr. Torricelli began an effort to line up Democratic leaders behind his potential candidacy. But over the weekend, Mr. McGreevey tied up the crucial endorsements of leaders in populous Essex County. On Monday, Mr. Torricelli announced he would not run for governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli has refused to offer an endorsement for Mr. McGreevey, and mentioned two other Democrats he said might seek the nomination: Representatives Bill Pascrell of Paterson and Frank Pallone Jr. of Long Branch. Mr. Pallone confirmed today that he was considering a run for the nomination.</p>
        <p>But Brad Lawrence, a spokesman for the McGreevey campaign, said it would be hard to mount a challenge with just the potential backing of leaders in the five counties not represented in today's show of support.  Those counties are Camden, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic and Burlington.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. McGreevey was gracious and stopped short of saying that he had replaced Mr. Torricelli as the ''the 800-pound gorilla'' of  state Democratic politics, adding, ''I have the gray hairs to prove it.''</p>
        <p>Among the leaders at today's event was Joseph A. Ferriero, Democratic chairman in Bergen County, the state's most populous and Mr. Torricelli's home county. Earlier in the week, Mr. Ferriero was in a quandary, unwilling to oppose a favorite son but still strongly attracted to the candidacy of Mr. McGreevey.  When Mayor Sharpe James of Newark held a news conference with other Essex County Democrats on Monday to support Mr. McGreevey, Mr. Ferriero was in the audience.</p>
        <p>''I was there to show my support for McGreevey,'' he said of his nervous wait on the sidelines. ''But if Bob Torricelli was a candidate, I would have to support him because he is our local senator. But today, with Bob not in the race, I'm free.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lawrence, of the McGreevey campaign, said that in contrast to the frantic pace of the last two weeks, Mr. McGreevey would use the more leisurely atmosphere of the coming months -- when the presidential and senatorial campaigns take center stage -- to bring other Democratic leaders into the fold.</p>
        <p>''There is still some hard work needed to heal,'' Mr. Lawrence said, ''but today is the beginning.''</p>
