        <p>ENNIS-Bruce J. The American Civil Liberties Union mourns the passing of Bruce J. Ennis, former Legal Director of the ACLU and a longtime friend and colleague. Bruce devoted his career to defending the rights of the most vulnerable among us, serving as the NYCLU's first Director of the Mental Patients' Rights Project and the first lawyer in the country to work full time on the rights of the mentally ill. After entering private practice in the 1980's, Bruce was one of the few, elite lawyers who argued frequently before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1997 he successfully argued Reno v. ACLU, which established landmark protection for internet speech. He was a kind and generous mentor who will be missed.</p>
