        <p>Giants Coach Jim Fassel said this morning that he had called Jets Coach Al Groh and canceled the joint practice scheduled between the teams Tuesday at West Point.</p>
        <p>''I felt bad because I'm the one who instigated all this,'' Fassel said. ''But in the end, considering everything, we're so thin in some spots I decided to make this move to cancel it now. It's like I told Al on the phone, I didn't want to be scrambling around and calling people to do this on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''He was disappointed, and I am, too.''</p>
        <p>Last week, the New England Patriots called the Giants to cancel the joint practice they had planned with the Giants. The Patriots said injuries in their camp made the joint practice too risky.</p>
        <p>Several Giants regulars -- free safety Shaun Williams, defensive end Michael Strahan and defensive tackle Keith Hamilton -- are not playing in Saturday night's preseason game against the Chicago Bears because of injuries. The Giants were also concerned about the timing of the joint practice. It would have come three days after the Giants' first preseason game and three days before their second preseason game.</p>
        <p>Groh, who once coached the Army plebes, said: ''I was looking forward to the competition. Plus, having coached there, was married there, coached games in the stadium. Both of us'' -- Fassel and Groh -- ''thought it would be very productive.''</p>
        <p>It also would have been the first time back for the Jets' new linebackers coach, Bob Sutton, who was fired last winter as Army's head coach.</p>
