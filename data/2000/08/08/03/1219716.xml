        <p>Max is trying to give the Kid some hope.</p>
        <p>Sure, his mount, Crown Derby, is going to be the longest shot on the board, he tells the jockey Norberto Arroyo Jr., but the sire on the dam side, General Assembly, set a track record that still stands here, roaring 1 1/4 miles in two minutes flat to win the 1979 Travers.</p>
        <p>''He won by 15 lengths in a track as sloppy as this one,'' Max Hall, Arroyo's agent, tells the 23-year-old apprentice rider. ''You got a big-time mudder.''</p>
        <p>But when Crown Derby showed he was every bit a 21-1 long shot in the fourth race here today and skidded home sixth in a seven-horse field, Hall told Arroyo what he already knew. ''It's my job to give you confidence, kid,'' Hall told him.</p>
        <p>More often than not, Hall has lined up live horses for his rider -- 138 winners and enough runners-up to earn $4,896,423 in purses in 2000, which probably is enough for Arroyo to capture the Eclipse as the nation's best apprentice rider. But the pair are in a hurry to make history. They are trying to run down the record of $5.1 million earned by Kent Desormeaux at the outset of his career in 1987. Their challenge is that Arroyo loses his bug, or weight allowance, on Saturday, which means he will graduate to journeyman status. He has at least 12 mounts to make up the difference.</p>
        <p>How Hall and Arroyo found each other in New England and decided to take on the New York circuit illustrates how successful riders need both fast horses beneath them and crafty agents behind them.</p>
        <p>Every rider has one. They roam the backsides in the morning, daybooks in hand, watching workouts to figure which barns have the fast horses. The trick then is to sell the talents of their rider to the trainers.</p>
        <p>Last fall, at the behest of Joe Hampshire, one of New England's leading riders, Hall took on Arroyo, who was exercising horses at Rockingham Park. The agent had never handled an apprentice, and at first passed on Arroyo. ''Every time I looked up, horses were getting loose or he was falling off,'' Hall said. ''I didn't want the headache.''</p>
        <p>But Arroyo kept pestering him. Soon, Hall was seeing progress as the young rider worked horses in the morning. He saw a rare combination of aggressiveness mixed with patience that he attributes to Arroyo's experience as an amateur boxer.</p>
        <p>''Besides, Hall said, ''he was a good, polite, well-spoken kid, and you don't come across that much.''</p>
        <p>The agent is a native of England who came to America with his family 31 years ago on a boat that landed in Revere, Mass., not far from Suffolk Downs. The fact about General Assembly's performance in the Travers rolled off his tongue in an accent that is part Buckingham Palace, part Fenway Park.</p>
        <p>Hall offered his apprentice free of charge to exercise horses in the morning and shopped the low-profile barns with long-odds horses for mounts in the afternoon. He wanted the fledgling jockey to make his mistakes on horses with little chance. Arroyo almost foiled the plan when he brought a 50-1 horse named Iron Lady home a winner on his third lifetime mount at Rockingham Park.</p>
        <p>Still, Arroyo rode another 120 horses before he picked up his fifth career victory, and his yearlong apprenticeship officially began. The decision to come to New York didn't take nearly as long. Arroyo was a quick study who could change hands with his whip deftly and keep a horse racing on the bit.</p>
        <p>''I had New York agents calling me to come down to ride in the winter at Aqueduct,'' Arroyo said. ''But Max taught me everything I knew, from how to talk to trainers to how to work them from the gate. I wanted us to stay together.''</p>
        <p>''It's not easy to bring a bug boy here with an out-of-town agent,'' said the trainer Robert Barbara, who has utilized Arroyo often. ''You only do it if you got a talented rider, which Norberto is, but Max got him off to a fast start because he is dedicated and a nice guy to be around.''</p>
        <p>As soon as Hall got him mounts, Arroyo delivered winning rides. He was the second-leading rider in the spring Aqueduct meet and finished fourth -- one victory shy of third-place Edgar Prado -- at the summer Belmont meeting. When Arroyo was given a 20-day suspension for careless riding at the Aqueduct meet, Hall tied the ruling up in the appeal process and then the courts.</p>
        <p>''It would have broken our momentum,'' Hall said. ''You might never have heard of us. Instead, he won 12 races that week.''</p>
        <p>As soon as perhaps Sunday, Arroyo will serve a total 40 days of suspension he has compiled and miss the rest of the Saratoga meet and part of the Belmont fall campaign. So today Hall returned from his home in Boston after a brief weekend stay. With Arroyo out, Hall will not be earning the standard agent deal of 25 percent of a rider's cut, which is 10 percent of the purse.</p>
        <p>But the whole point of this year was winning the Eclipse Award, Hall said. ''That is my Kentucky Derby, and I think we're going to win it.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>The Grade III Honorable Miss Stakes at six furlongs was run in two divisions today on a muddy track and beneath intermittent rain storms. Debby D'or, with Shane Sellers aboard, was the long-shot winner of the first heat. She paid $26.80 for a $2 bet. In the second division, the second-choice Bourbon Belle romped by seven lengths and paid $7.20.</p>
