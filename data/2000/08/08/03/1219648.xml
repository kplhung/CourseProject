It's not for lack of talent: Ms. Ayllon, who is in her mid-40's and whose career began in the late 70's, is a strong and outrageously good singer.

        <p>Afro-Peruvian music, which imported older African rhythms into Spanish and Andean song, became popular all over Peru during the 1970's and 80's, when many South American countries were discovering their cultural roots. By the mid-90's it even crept into highbrow American musical culture, via the album ''The Soul of Black Peru,'' an anthology put together by the Luaka Bop label.

        <p>But the career of Eva Ayllon, another singer featured on that record, has not thrived here, and from her performance at Queens Theater in the Park on Tuesday, part of the AT&amp;T Latino Cultural Festival 2000, it was easy to see why. It's not for lack of talent: Ms. Ayllon, who is in her mid-40's and whose career began in the late 70's, is a strong and outrageously good singer. It's that her music has the temper of out-and-out romantic pop, which can be hard for those outside its cultural references to grasp. Still, Ms. Baca makes an ingenious cross between folklore and highbrow art music, two concepts that the American ''world music'' audience well understands.</p>
        <p>For two hard-working hours, Ms. Ayllon's songs moved between waltzes and the Afro-Peruvian rhythms called lando (in three-four) and festejo (in six-eight). At the heart of her band were the drummers. One played the cajon, the wooden box commonly seen in this kind of music, which the player sat on and beat with his hands; one played bongos, and a third played four tuned congas.</p>
        <p>They each made partial patterns, interlocking them so that the high-pitched net of rhythm jumped and jolted and carried the songs along. Otherwise, the band was built of guitars (two nylon-string acoustics, one electric bass) and synthesizers (one on a piano setting, the other imitating guitars, drums, accordions and whatever else was needed).</p>
        <p>Her repertory is filled with references to black and Peruvian pride, about black Peruvians rediscovering their music after slavery and about the natural and historical wonders of her country. But there's also a high quotient of standard tear-jerking romance in her music: songs like ''Mal Paso'' and ''Que Somos Amantes'' were slick, dramatic ballads of troubled love, and Ms. Ayllon's strong, smoky voice hurled the words out powerfully.</p>
        <p>There is cultural consciousness in this music even at the most showbiz-like level. Ms. Ayllon is a highly strung, sharp-tongued, funny performer. She lampooned popular singers; made jokes about her ex-boyfriend, the pianist; and executed the trick (for an entirely Spanish-speaking but multnational audience) of singing bits of songs that were popular among Chileans, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans.</p>
        <p>This was all agreeable, if not that profound. Then she yelled ''Ritmo negro!'' (''Black rhythm!''), and a physical, rocking round of percussion flooded in, causing the synthetic guitars and drums to fall away into the background.</p>
