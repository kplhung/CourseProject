        <p>Six weeks ago, John Franco was called into a tie game at Shea Stadium. He allowed one run, recorded one out and left with the bases loaded. Then Armando Benitez came in and gave up a grand slam. That was the last time either of those Mets pitchers allowed an earned run.</p>
        <p>Franco, Benitez and Turk Wendell shut down the Cincinnati Reds yesterday to give the Mets and Al Leiter a 2-1 victory, completing an 8-1 homestand in which they did everything but gain significant ground on the Atlanta Braves in the National League East. The Mets trailed Atlanta by five and a half games before the Braves' game last night at Arizona; they were six back before the homestand.</p>

        <p>Six weeks ago, John Franco was called into a tie game at Shea Stadium. He allowed one run, recorded one out and left with the bases loaded. Then Armando Benitez came in and gave up a grand slam. That was the last time either of those Mets pitchers allowed an earned run.</p>
        <p>Franco, Benitez and Turk Wendell shut down the Cincinnati Reds yesterday to give the Mets and Al Leiter a 2-1 victory, completing an 8-1 homestand in which they did everything but gain significant ground on the Atlanta Braves in the National League East. The Mets trailed Atlanta by five and a half games before the Braves' game last night at Arizona; they were six back before the homestand.</p>
        <p>Robin Ventura's two-run home run in the first inning gave Leiter and the bullpen all the necessary run support. Leiter improved to 12-4 by working seven strong innings, and seven innings are all the Mets need these days. If they have a lead by then, they believe they will win. ''That's a really good feeling to have,'' first baseman Todd Zeile said.</p>
        <p>Mets relievers allowed only two earned runs in 21 2/3 innings on this homestand, and they have been brilliant for three weeks. The current group has an earned run average of 0.99 since the All-Star Game, and it is easy to see why the Mets have been able to win by one or two runs in 10 of their last 13 victories.</p>
        <p>''This is what everybody envisioned early in the year, that the bullpen would be one of our strong points,'' Franco said. ''We picked it up.''</p>
        <p>The biggest games on the homestand, catcher Todd Pratt said, were the two victories over Montreal in a doubleheader last Thursday. In the first game, Grant Roberts, a rookie, gave up seven runs in less than two innings. But four relievers held down the Expos to make a comeback victory possible. In the second game, Mike Hampton pitched a complete game.</p>
        <p>A rested bullpen helped the Mets win their next two games against St. Louis, and Bobby J. Jones pitched a complete game in the finale on Sunday against the Cardinals, resting the bullpen again.</p>
        <p>''They're rested, confident and shortening the game,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''I think that adds to the confidence of the team.''</p>
        <p>After Leiter struck out the side in the seventh inning yesterday, completing a stretch in which he retired 18 of 19 hitters, Franco came in to face the top of the order in the eighth. He got two outs, then had two strikes on Ken Griffey Jr. when Zeile moved closer to the line at first, protecting against an extra-base hit. Griffey bounced one to the spot Zeile vacated for a single, and Wendell was summoned.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Wendell had allowed a run-scoring triple to Dante Bichette, the only batter he faced. He faced Bichette again yesterday, throwing one pitch, which Bichette grounded to first, ending the inning.</p>
        <p>Benitez worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his 27th save, and after the game he gave credit to one of his setup men, Franco.</p>
        <p>''If Franco doesn't do the job, I don't do the job,'' Benitez said. ''We have good communication. What he's doing, it's great.''</p>
        <p>What is Franco doing? ''Just trying to get outs and get the ball to Armando,'' he said. And what is working? ''Just everything, really,'' Franco said. ''The changeup, the fastball's moving in and out, just trying to throw strikes and let them put it in play. We've got guys behind us that are pretty good fielders.''</p>
        <p>One of those guys is Mike Bordick, the veteran shortstop acquired from Baltimore in a trade last week. In the fourth inning, Bordick reached up to spear a hard grounder from Pokey Reese that shot up over his right shoulder on one hop. Such plays are almost routine with Bordick, who played his first game with the Mets last Saturday, the same day that Ventura, the third baseman, another excellent fielder, was activated from the disabled list.</p>
        <p>The Mets have missed Ventura's bat this year. Bothered by a bruised right rotator cuff, Ventura slumped before the All-Star Game break and did not feel better the first day after it.</p>
        <p>He did not make much of yesterday's homer -- ''I'd rather be lucky than good,'' Ventura said, quizzically -- but acknowledged how much the Mets need him, especially when he bats fifth, behind Mike Piazza.</p>
        <p>''When you bat behind Mike, you don't want people to walk him,'' he said. ''The job for the person batting behind him is to make sure they pitch to him and give him pitches to hit, and you have to be getting singles and everything else to do that.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Ventura batted third while Piazza rested. Ventura's home run was his 17th, second only to Piazza on the Mets. But he has only 39 singles, and he said he wanted to be more consistent in getting base hits. The Mets, who have the second-best record in the National League, can wait.</p>
        <p>''I thought all of Robin's swings today were Robinesque,'' Valentine said. ''There's no doubt that he's a guy we're counting on, depending on, and we're going to jump on his back a few times before this thing's over. Today was one of those days.''</p>
        <p>The bullpen also carried its load, just as it has for weeks.</p>
        <p>''We're clicking pretty well,'' Wendell said, ''but we know we can still pitch a little better.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Second baseman EDGARDO ALFONZO missed the game because he bruised his left shin while turning a double play on Tuesday. He said that it was nothing and that he would play tomorrow in Arizona, where the Mets begin a seven-game road trip that includes four games in Houston. The Mets' RICK REED will face Arizona's RANDY JOHNSON in the opener, but the Mets will avoid the Diamondbacks' other ace, CURT SCHILLING. . . . JOE BICK, the agent for shortstop MIKE BORDICK, said he would be ''receptive to any conversations'' the Mets would intiate on a contract extension, but Bordick is in no hurry to get something done. . . . The Mets plan to give center fielder DARRYL HAMILTON some playing time in left field on his rehabilitation assignment at Class AAA Norfolk. . . . Reds right-hander ELMER DESSENS passed out after the game and was taken to Mt. Sinai Hospital, where he was treated for dehydration.</p>
