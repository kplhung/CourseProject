        <p>President Clinton today delayed what would have been the first federal execution in nearly 40 years as the  Justice Department issued new clemency procedures for inmates on federal death row.</p>
        <p>Juan Raul Garza, a drug dealer from Texas who was convicted of three murders seven years ago, had been scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection three days from now.</p>
        <p>The president's decision postponed the execution to give Mr. Garza time to take advantage of the new clemency guidelines. He is now scheduled to be executed on Dec. 12 at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind.</p>
        <p>Gregory Wiercioch, one of Mr. Garza's lawyers, said tonight in a telephone interview that he planned to use the new clemency procedures to ask President Clinton to spare his client's life.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, we are very pleased that the president has stayed the execution,'' Mr. Wiercioch said.</p>
        <p>He also said that in seeking clemency from the president he would argue that members of minorities, like Mr. Garza, as well as defendants in certain parts of the country, are far more likely to face the federal death penalty than are other criminals.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department is finishing a report on whether such disparities exist in the application of the federal death penalty, and Mr. Wiercioch said he hoped the report would be completed before his client's clemency hearing.</p>
        <p>The data collected so far by the Justice Department indicated that members of minorities made up more than three-quarters of the defendants in federal capital cases and that federal prosecutors in five districts, including two in New York, had filed nearly half of the cases in which the federal death penalty was an option.</p>
        <p>''The information we have seen tells us that the color of a defendant's skin and where the crime was committed are two impermissible factors playing a major role in the government's decision to seek death,'' Mr. Wiercioch said. ''But we need to see the final conclusions of the study being conducted by the Department of Justice.''</p>
        <p>The clemency procedures, which were approved by Attorney General Janet Reno and President Clinton, are the first in federal capital cases since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.</p>
        <p>The procedures call for giving death row inmates 120 days notice of the date of their execution, along with 30 days from the time they receive that notice to ask the president to commute their sentence.</p>
        <p>The new guidelines also give lawyers for death row inmates an opportunity to make an oral presentation to a clemency panel. The clemency process, from the initial filing to the final decision, will take 90 days. The rules also give the relatives of victims the opportunity to make their own oral presentation to the clemency panel, though only with the assistance of the prosecutors in the case.</p>
        <p>The White House expects the Justice Department to complete a review of the racial and geographical breakdowns of people on death row within the coming weeks. The information will then be passed along to Mr. Garza's lawyers for the clemency petition.</p>
        <p>It is far from clear what Mr. Clinton will ultimately decide. He has been a supporter of the death penalty since he was governor of Arkansas, where he refused to commute several death sentences.</p>
        <p>But the report being prepared by the Justice Department is almost certain to raise questions about the fairness of the way the federal death penalty is applied not just in the Garza case but in others as well. Twenty-one men are on federal death row.</p>
        <p>A White House official said it was necessary to postpone Mr. Garza's execution in order to give him the same opportunity to use the new clemency procedures that other death row inmates will now have.</p>
        <p>''This is an incredibly weighty matter,'' the official said. ''Garza would have been treated differently from everyone else on death row. This is far too important based on what happens in the end or doesn't happen.''</p>
        <p>The president's power to pardon are absolute under the Constitution. In Mr. Garza's case, the president's options include a pardon, which would erase the criminal record, or commutation to a life sentence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garza, a Mexican-American high school dropout who is the son of migrant farm workers, was the head of a drug-running operation that smuggled in tons of marijuana from Mexico, the federal charges said. He was convicted in 1993 in Brownsville, Tex., of ordering three executions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garza has insisted that he was not responsible for the murders. But in seeking clemency, his lawyers do not intend to argue that he is innocent. Instead, they will maintain that it is unfair to put Mr. Garza to death because the federal death penalty system, as it currently operates, is discriminatory, racially and ethnically, and unevenly applied.</p>
