        <p>WHEN the Scottish movie ''Trainspotting,'' about young heroin addicts, hit theaters in 1996, some critics called it an advertisement for drug use. But for the residents of 713 East Ninth Street, just east of Avenue C, the film was an opportunity.</p>
        <p>The residents, calling themselves Dos Blockos, were a close-knit group of squatters inhabiting an abandoned six-story tenement that had been stripped of wires, pipes, anything neighborhood addicts could convert to quick cash. When a glossy magazine wanted an appropriately derelict backdrop for a ''Trainspotting'' photo shoot, the squatters volunteered their homes -- for a location fee of $500 a day. ''We used that money to put plumbing in the building,'' said Dan, who had lived in the squat at the time, and declined to give his last name.</p>
        <p>It was a funny transaction, the squatters marketing their picturesque squalor in order to inch their building closer to gentility. But such was life on Avenue C in 1996: a push and pull between urban entropy and bootstrap self-improvement, with money conspicuous primarily for its scarcity. While other parts of the East Village were becoming playgrounds for gentrification, Avenue C was still a frontier. ''Avenue C was pretty crazy,'' said Dan, who is no longer a squatter. ''But it was also beautiful. People were living outside the rules of society.''</p>
        <p>Four years since ''Trainspotting,'' that frontier has been redrawn. On a drizzly evening last week, Mark Edio returned to his home at 713 East Ninth Street, the former site of the Dos Blockos squat. But Mr. Edio, a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology, was returning to a different sort of home: new sheetrock walls, videophone security and key-card entry to the front door. The floors glistened and the common hallways smelled faintly of renovation. The squatters were gone.</p>
        <p>''It's the perfect apartment,'' Mr. Edio said. As he saw it, the new place was big, it was cheap and it was in a great neighborhood.</p>
        <p>He was speaking the new language of Avenue C. Decoded: For roughly 1,000 square feet, on a site until recently deemed not worth maintaining, Mr. Edio and three roommates have just signed a lease for $3,000 a month. It is, they feel, a find.</p>
        <p>The story of the Dos Blockos squat and the new, high-priced rentals that are replacing it mirrors the story of Avenue C, a prosaic stretch that once seemed impervious to change. After decades of disregard, the avenue is in a state of rapid, some say rabid, churn. As crime rates have fallen and fortunes risen citywide, the tide of gentrification has pushed eastward, into the shoe-box tenements and worn street life that long resisted its seep. The newcomers are lured not by fixer-upper lofts or brownstones but by the night life and a social swank, and by the diversity they threaten to upset. ''Here you've got students, you've got professional people, you've got bums,'' said Mr. Edio, who moved from Brooklyn's Park Slope. ''It's more real.''</p>
        <p>In storefronts that once housed drug dens, a handful of entrepreneurs are opening smart bistros, bars and cafes. Neat row house co-ops have risen in place of crumbling squats and community gardens. Gone, too, are the cinder blocks that sealed abandoned buildings; behind the new, double-pane windows are tiny one-bedroom apartments renting for $2,000 a month, surprising even real estate agents.</p>
        <p>''We started to see people get $500-plus per square foot about a year ago'' for co-ops, said Stephen Kliegerman of the Halstead Property Company, or nearly triple what co-ops sold for in the mid-1990's. ''This isn't a fringe neighborhood anymore, it's a mainstream neighborhood,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Blocks that long vibrated with the colors and flavors of working-class Latino families are increasingly drawing dot-comers and students, many of whom, like Mr. Edio, rely on family money to pay the new rents, which have doubled in the last five years.</p>
        <p>''I have my parents for now,'' said Meegan Thompson, 22, who moved into a newly renovated building on East Fifth Street between Avenue B and Avenue C in early July. Ms. Thompson, who graduated from Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland, Ore., in May, is looking for a job in publishing. ''I've worked out the math,'' she said. To make her half of the $2,050 rent, she figured, she needs to find a job paying $26,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Here is another sign of the times: the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center, which provides clean needles and services to drug users, wants to leave the area. ''We're looking for a place where our participants won't have to walk past haute couture clothing stores on their way to us,'' said Drew Kramer, the center's executive director.</p>
        <p>Like many long-term residents, Richard Hell, a musician and novelist, has watched with resignation and sadness as more affluent waves of newcomers have moved east. He came to the neighborhood in the early 1970's, attracted by its cheap rents and invitation to creative dishabille. As a member of the bands Television and the Voidoids, he helped draw punk rockers to the East Village, bringing along a swell of anti-gentrification resentment.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry to see my neighborhood turned into a Coney Island boardwalk, Bleecker Street tourist trap, but it is kind of the cycle,'' said Mr. Hell, whose real surname is Myers. ''The kids come in, then the young artists, and they displace the poor. Then they get displaced. To me it's just like the weather by now.''</p>
        <p>The neighborhood has a history of resisting gentrification, sometimes violently. Twelve years ago this month, locals clashed with police in riot gear over a proposed curfew in Tompkins Square Park. Thirteen police officers and 40 civilians were injured over two days of conflict. Since then, protesters have skirmished with police over the eviction of squatters or the bulldozing of gardens to make room for mixed-income co-ops, some distributed by lottery. The unofficial greeting remains ''Yuppie Go Home''</p>
        <p>But as the new gentry have pushed east to Avenue C, known locally as Loisaida Avenue, the voices of protest have been uncharacteristically quiet. ''A lot of people just accepted that this is like trying to stop a Mack truck,'' said Lesley Heathcote, a gardener and painter who has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years. Ms. Heathcote added, ''A lot of people who have come in aren't part of this latest wave but want a more middle-class lifestyle, so aren't going to fight the gentrification in the same way.''</p>
        <p>Still, locals say the economic gap between new and old residents has never been greater.</p>
        <p>Last week, Maizie Torres, 33, reflected on the sweep of transformation along the avenue. Ms. Torres has lived in the neighborhood all her life, and now works for the tenant advocacy group Good Old Lower East Side, or Goles. When she was a teenager, her parents would not let her leave the apartment by herself, she said, because the neighborhood was too dangerous and drug-infested.  Now, as a single mother of four, Ms. Torres is relieved that she can let her children go to the store alone.</p>
        <p>Though she cannot afford the new cafes, she welcomes her new neighbors. The co-op owners she has met, she said, have adopted the local ethos of community self-improvement.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Torres is at best ambivalent about the broader changes in the neighborhood. Her apartment, on East Tenth Street between Avenue B and Avenue C, has for the last 20 years been subsidized under a federal Housing and Urban Development Department program that allows low-income tenants to keep their rents at 30 percent of their incomes; HUD picks up the rest. Ms. Torres currently pays $203 a month.</p>
        <p>DURING lean times, when the neighborhood was racked by drugs and neglect, such subsidies were profitable for landlords.  But as rents around Avenue C began climbing, they lost their luster.</p>
        <p>This year, along with 150 of her neighbors, Ms. Torres received a chilling notice: at the end of October, her landlord, the Center Development Corporation, has the option to drop out of the HUD program. This change would allow it to bring rents up to market rate -- or way beyond the reach of most tenants.</p>
        <p>William Hubbard, a general partner at the corporation, says it will probably stay with the HUD program, negotiating higher, so-called mark-up-to-market subsidies from the government. But this possibility offers small comfort to Ms. Torres.</p>
        <p>''I don't mind the new people in the neighborhood,'' she said. ''I just have a problem that our landlord made money off this contract for 20 years, and now he thinks it's time for us to get out. Now that the community's cleaned up, we should be able to live in a neighborhood that's cleaned up.''</p>
        <p>Even where subsidies are not an issue, some landlords are eager to evict low-income tenants in order to raise the rent, said Margaret Hughes, the executive director of Goles. Five to ten families come to the organization daily, ''at the precipice'' of losing their apartments, she said. The organization can no longer help out families who want to move into low-income housing; it can barely see all the people who are about to lose their apartments.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of animosity toward the new people coming in,'' Ms. Torres said. ''I try to explain that it's not the new people. You can't blame them because they can afford it. We direct animosity more toward the landlords and politicians and the developers.''</p>
        <p>The changes on the avenue become most striking after dark. A few years back, come evening, the strip was deserted save for the drug traffic and the Latino social clubs. Now, the same sidewalks bustle with well-dressed young people promenading  among a handful of new bars and restaurants: C-Note, 9C, Baraza, Esperanto, Alphabet Lounge. Though not the Saturnalian theme park that Avenue B or Ludlow Street have become, the strip of the avenue between Seventh Street and Eleventh Street is evolving into a night life destination.</p>
        <p>''I like the ambience over here,'' said Monica Bhambhani, a New York University graduate student, who was finishing a Pan-Latin dinner at Esperanto. Ms. Bhambhani, who lives near Union Square, found the restaurant through Citysearch.com and thought it might make a good spot for her coming birthday party. ''The people here are more eclectic'' than uptown, she said. On a Saturday night out with a woman friend, Ms. Bhambhani said, she felt safer on Avenue C than in Midtown.</p>
        <p>Dimitri Vlahakis, 34, and Stephan Gerville-Reache, 33, the owners of Esperanto and Baraza, are among the avenue's agents of change. Mr. Vlahakis grew up and still lives in Bensonhurst; Mr. Gerville-Reache grew up in the banlieues of Paris,the blocks of housing projects, built for immigrant laborers, that ring the city.</p>
        <p>They were drawn to Avenue C three years ago by the cheap rents and limited competition, but also by the character of the neighborhood: the gardens reclaimed from sites of devastation, the mix of artists, working Latino families and squatters. ''It's a real neighborhood, with families and old people,'' Mr. Gerville-Reache said. ''Not like a fake neighborhood like SoHo, where everyone is between 20 and 40.''</p>
        <p>When they first opened Baraza, they found a sign at a flea market that read, ''No Cocaine Peddling.'' It seemed perfect for the bar. The location, as they understood it, had once been a base for coke dealers. In their first weeks, squatters scrawled anti-yuppie graffiti on the bar's gate. But soon after, the two men noticed the same people coming in to drink, listening as Mr. Gerville-Reache spun salsa music on the turntables. The squatters ''were testing us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The current night life pickings on the strip are just a small sample of what's to come. By fall, at least five bars or restaurants are planning to open, including a spinoff of the popular First Avenue bar D.B.A., which specializes in single-malt whiskeys, and a combination cafe and furniture design studio, which will showcase high-end pieces beyond the means even of the new local swells.</p>
        <p>On a recent afternoon, Sylvester Schneider set to work on a mission that seems idiosyncratic even for this neighborhood: Zum Schneider, a traditional Bavarian beer garden, complete with plaster trees. If this is gentrification, it is from within as much as from without. Most of the new entrepreneurs, like Mr. Schneider, live in the area, and struggle under budgets as taut as those of the neighboring households. Ray Deter, a co-owner of D.B.A., lives with his wife and two kids in a one-bedroom apartment off Avenue B and sends the children to the local public school. He said he cannot afford a bigger apartment in the neighborhood. ''I'm stupid,'' Mr. Deter said. ''I should have taken a place on Avenue C a couple years ago,'' before the rents took helium.</p>
        <p>The gentrification, though, may be reaching its natural limits. Janet Abu-Lughod, a professor emerita at the New School for Social Research and the author of ''From Urban Village to East Village: The Battle for New York's Lower East Side'' (Blackwell), has studied the slum properties of the area and feels that the conditions for gentrification -- undervalued properties in a desirable location -- have been overtaken by all the new arrivals. The bargains are now in Harlem, she said.</p>
        <p>Even the current veneer of snazz  runs shallow, a thing of Sheetrock rather than bedrock, warned Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, a longtime housing advocate in the neighborhood. Business on Avenue C has a rocky track record. Ms. Lopez ticked off the names of several establishments that came and went in the last year. ''Turnover continues to create an environment of instability and speculation,'' she said. ''Developers and speculators are getting rich, that's it. It's not the residents, not the small business community.''</p>
        <p>As for the Dos Blockos squatters, after several losing court battles, they awoke on the morning of April 27, 1999, to a police helicopter and officers in riot helmets coming to remove them from their homes. The encounter was noisy but nonviolent. Dan and several other squatters ultimately ended up in Bushwick, Brooklyn, renovating a loft in another poor, long-neglected neighborhood.</p>
        <p>More recently, he decided to leave Bushwick for Harlem, where another wave of pioneers, black and white, are riding another neighborhood through transition.</p>
        <p>For Dan, Harlem offers a fresh renewal, but also the start of a familiar cycle -- like Avenue C before it. ''I have some contradictions,'' he said. ''I see that my person, my culture, my lifestyle facilitates gentrification. It's like I'm a tool of the system. I don't know what to do. I just live my life the way I live it.''</p>
        <p>Under his nest of sandy brown dreadlocks, Dan now tends bar at Baraza and Esperanto, where the new gentry of the neighborhood come to make merry. He has become a student of the neighborhood's change. The new apartments at 713 East Ninth, he pointed out, are smaller than those of the squat.</p>
        <p>On Avenue C, the cultural mix continues its rock and its roll, listing toward an equilibrium it never quite finds. Mr. Edio and his roommates represent one element, trying to make a home amid the swirl.</p>
        <p>The other night, one of the roommates watched someone stealing a bicycle on the street below, but this hardly shook Mr. Edio's regard for his new home. He is planning a trip to Ikea, soon.</p>
