        <p>It was disheartening to see Colin Powell up there doing his bit to help mask the reality of the G.O.P., a party that since the 1960's has been relentlessly hostile to the interests of black Americans.</p>
        <p>This was on Monday night, when you couldn't tell whether you were at the Republican National Convention or the Motown Review. The number of blacks paraded before a national television audience by this nearly all-white convention was incredible. The delegates are about 90 percent white, mostly male and rigidly conservative. So it was a breathtaking exercise in hypocrisy for them to haul so many blacks before the cameras for the sole purpose of singing, dancing, preaching and praising a party that has wanted no part of them.</p>

        <p>It was disheartening to see Colin Powell up there doing his bit to help mask the reality of the G.O.P., a party that since the 1960's has been relentlessly hostile to the interests of black Americans.</p>
        <p>This was on Monday night, when you couldn't tell whether you were at the Republican National Convention or the Motown Review. The number of blacks paraded before a national television audience by this nearly all-white convention was incredible. The delegates are about 90 percent white, mostly male and rigidly conservative. So it was a breathtaking exercise in hypocrisy for them to haul so many blacks before the cameras for the sole purpose of singing, dancing, preaching and praising a party that has wanted no part of them.</p>
        <p>General Powell used some of his time to urge the party to become more inclusive, and chastised it for opposing affirmative action. But he nevertheless was the featured performer in the cynical lineup of blacks and other minorities that was put together in a blatant effort to cast the party as something it is not. If you looked at the stage during this farce, and then turned and looked at the audience, you saw two entirely different worlds.</p>
        <p>It's been like that all week -- ethnic overkill to mask the party's lack of diversity. J. C. Watts, a black Republican Congressman from Oklahoma, was harmonizing one moment with the Temptations, and singing the next with a gospel choir. Other entertainment was provided by rhythm 'n' blues singers, dancing black children and a fired-up preacher and his exultant congregation.</p>
        <p>The makeover artists of the G.O.P. put together a slick mix of race, religion and culture and used it for all the wrong reasons. It was exploitive and demeaning.</p>
        <p>The Republicans still aren't interested in blacks. They are simply trying to present a friendlier, more moderate face to white, middle-class swing voters who have been put off by the party's excesses over the past several years.</p>
        <p>If the Republicans really wanted to embrace black voters (and not just black children at photo ops) they would honestly address such things as Dick Cheney's voting record; George W. Bush's campaign appearance at Bob Jones University; George Herbert Walker Bush's use of the disgraceful Willie Horton (let's-scare-the-white-folks) campaign ads; President Bush's cynical selection of Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court; and the G.O.P.'s viciously anti-black Southern strategy, which has been a divisive force in American politics for more than 30 years.</p>
        <p>If the Republicans were serious they would reassess the many long years they spent attacking programs for children and the elderly and the sick, and demonizing Democrats and liberals for attempting to help minorities and the poor.</p>
        <p>But they're not serious. They are engaged in a four-day charade, an exercise in duplicity that includes the shameless theft of the slogan ''Leave no child behind,'' which was the registered trademark of the Children's Defense fund, a favorite G.O.P. target.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush says he is a ''different'' kind of Republican. But different from what? We need to know what it was about the Republican Party of the last several decades that he thinks should be changed.</p>
        <p>Does he think Republican policies need to change, or just that Republican candidates should hug more black children?</p>
        <p>Republicans have long favored enormous tax cuts that served the dual purpose of providing bonanzas for the wealthy and bleeding the government of funds that could be used to help the less fortunate.</p>
        <p>Does Mr. Bush think that should change?</p>
        <p>Most of the Republicans I spoke with this week found it difficult to think of anything substantive about their party that should change.</p>
        <p>Representative John Kasich, a conservative Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, was typical.</p>
        <p>''We believe in less government,'' he said.</p>
        <p>I asked what he thought Mr. Bush meant when he talked about a ''different'' kind of Republican.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasich looked uncomfortable. ''I don't know,'' he said. ''I don't know. You'd have to ask George Bush how he's different.''</p>
