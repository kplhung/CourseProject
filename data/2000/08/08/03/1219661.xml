        <p>Until recently, computer users measured out their lives in downloading times. Now there's an even slower, more agonizing measurement of time discovered by those who copy or create their own CD's: burning time.</p>
        <p>Most CD-rewritable drives copy data at a ratio of about eight to one, meaning that they can  record about 60 minutes of music (or 545 megabytes of data) onto a compact disc in about 7 1/2 minutes. The new veloCD (pronounced ''velocity'') burner from TDK can record 60 minutes' worth of music in about five minutes, a big difference for those who are already late for the party.</p>
        <p>Those speeds refer only to write-once discs (CD-R). Copying data onto rewritable discs (CD-RW), an increasingly popular option for people who want to back up their data, is slightly slower,  although the veloCD still copies data on a rewritable disc in about half the usual time.</p>
        <p>But you'll pay for that higher gear. The suggested retail price for the PC-compatible internal burner is $399, which is more expensive than many similar devices. To achieve full speed, it's also necessary to use TDK's high-speed discs, which run about $4.99 each, more than twice the price of most generic rewritable discs. The velo CD also comes with music management software and Burn-Proof, a licensed technology that allows users to open other applications on the computer while information is being copied.</p>
