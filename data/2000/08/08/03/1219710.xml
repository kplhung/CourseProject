        <p>The money manager who promised Hollywood stars and other artists a safe investment haven pleaded guilty yesterday to fraud and admitted to misappropriating some of his clients' funds.</p>
        <p>''What I built became so big that I lost control,'' said Dana C. Giacchetto, whose Cassandra Group investment advisory firm counted such stars as Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Cameron Diaz among its clients.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giacchetto, a 37-year-old Manhattan resident, was charged with five criminal counts in federal court earlier this year and pleaded guilty to one of them, fraud under the Investment Advisory Act. Under terms of the plea agreement, he faces 46 to 57 months in prison and restitution payments to fraud victims as well as a possible fine. He is to be sentenced on Nov. 3 by Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. of the Federal District Court in Manhattan. Under the agreement, the other four counts will be dismissed, but Mr. Giacchetto still faces continuing litigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giacchetto managed more than $100 million for more than 300 clients. The Cassandra Group, which he founded, billed itself as a provider of conservative investments for clients who might be naive about money.</p>
        <p>But according to court documents, Mr. Giacchetto misappropriated more than $9 million of Cassandra clients' money by moving it from a custodial account to bank accounts controlled by Cassandra. He also misled some of his clients about why money was being withdrawn from their accounts, telling them that it was being used to buy bonds or other investments when it was not.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Giacchetto used the money to cover a variety of expenses, according to court documents. Some of the money was used to pay rent on the Cassandra Group's Manhattan loft, to cover more than $100,000 of airline tickets and helicopter rides, to pay individual restaurant bills that in some cases exceeded $15,000, and to donate $5,000 to the New York Police Scholarship Foundation.</p>
        <p>Dressed in light blue prison scrubs, the studious-looking Mr. Giacchetto smiled and chatted amiably with his attorney, Ronald P. Fischetti, until it was time for him to rise and address the court. At that point, he began to weep, pausing several times to regain his composure.</p>
        <p>''When I started Cassandra Group I had the idea that artists were taken advantage of and exploited,'' he said. ''I'd like to apologize to everyone I caused harm to.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''I pray and hope we will make reparations and that no one will lose money. I intended that everyone would get paid back.''</p>
        <p>Exactly how many people lost money is not yet clear, but attorneys on both sides said they would work to determine that over the next several months. Mr. Fischetti said that reports of Hollywood stars losing money were exaggerated.</p>
        <p>''None of these stars have lost a dime,'' he said, mentioning Mr. DiCaprio and the actress Courtney Cox Arquette. He added that some clients that claimed to have had money taken from them actually lost money because of poor investments.</p>
        <p>''In Hollywood, when a person falls from grace, all his friends disappear,'' Mr. Fischetti added.</p>
        <p>But at least a dozen of Cassandra's clients lost ''significant'' amounts, according to Alexander M. Vasilescu, a senior trial counsel for the S.E.C.</p>
        <p>''Some have lost hundreds of thousands,'' he added. The rock band Phish, he said, lost more than $1 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giacchetto was arrested on April 4 and released on a $1 million bond the same day. He initially pleaded not guilty to all the charges.</p>
        <p>Five days later, he obtained tickets from New York airports to Los Angeles, Honolulu, Tokyo, Singapore, Germany and Italy, according to court documents. He was taken into custody at Newark International Airport on April 12 after violating the terms of his parole by flying to Las Vegas. When he was arrested, he was carrying 80 airline tickets and about $4,000 in cash.</p>
        <p>In court yesterday, Mr. Giacchetto explained that his firm was named for ''a prophetess who foretold the fall of Troy.'' Considering Cassandra, he said the name he chose was ''fitting for someone contemplating a long term in prison.''</p>
