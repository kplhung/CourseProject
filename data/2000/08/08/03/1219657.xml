        <p>Long e-mail messages are rarely welcome by busy computer users. But they can be almost unbearable when viewed through the tiny screens of wireless gadgets.</p>
        <p>AmikaNow, a Canadian software company, now offers a service that it says will automatically extract only the most important sentences before passing them on to a wireless device.</p>
        <p>''People want e-mail highlights,'' said Suhayya Abu-Hakim, the company's president and chief executive. AmikaFreedom.com is a Web-based variation of software the company has been selling for about a year.</p>
        <p>To use it, users must fill out a long registration form to indicate, among other things, the address of their main e-mail servers. AmikaNow's servers copy e-mail messages as they arrive at customers' main mail servers. The software then does the chopping, first by selecting the most important sentences, then by further reducing them.</p>
        <p>The software is largely based on artificial intelligence research by Dr. Abu-Hakim at the Canadian government's National Research Council.</p>
        <p>Not all the decisions about cuts are made using complex algorithms. The first sentence is usually the first to go, Dr. Abu-Hakim said, because ''a lot of people begin e-mails with some nicety like 'it was good to see you again.' ''</p>
        <p>By the company's estimate, the software has a success rate of 75 percent to 80 percent. That is  partly because of the current software's limitations, Dr. Abu-Hakim acknowledged.</p>
        <p>But she said there was another important factor: ''Not everyone writes well. In the case where the e-mail makes no sense and the writing is poor, the highlight is going to be poor.''</p>
        <p>The service is currently free as it is still in development. Dr. Abu-Hakim said the company planned to start charging users $2 to $5 a month for the service by the end of the year.</p>
