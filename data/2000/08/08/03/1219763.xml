        <p>The first time Blake Stein visited Yankee Stadium two years ago, he kept his jacket on while he sat nervously in the bullpen because he did not want any raucous fans to see the name on his Oakland Athletics uniform. Some of Stein's teammates warned him that the fans would orally harass him if they found out who he was, so Stein kept his jacket buttoned and tried to remain anonymous.</p>
        <p>Stein, who is now with the Kansas City Royals, was not anonymous yesterday, and everyone noticed the name on his uniform because he frustrated the Yankees in meandering to a 4-1 victory.</p>
        <p>It was a listless day at Yankee Stadium. The sun finally poked through and it was warm, dry and humid, weather suitable for playing baseball or taking a nap. The Yankees did more of the latter against Stein.</p>
        <p>While Stein stymied the Yankees on one run and two hits in eight innings, some Yankees did not feel as if they had been dominated because Stein walked six and allowed baserunners in eight innings. But Stein stopped the Yankees in a rare way, feeding them fastballs as he fell behind in the count and then getting them to sock harmless fly balls to the deepest parts of the Stadium in left field and center field.</p>
        <p>''It helps me realize I do have a place here,'' Stein said. ''I can pitch in the big leagues. The Yankees are one of the best teams in baseball for the last four or five years and one of the best this year. To come in and pitch this way is a really good feeling.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees looked sluggish when the Royals rapped Denny Neagle for three runs in the second inning, and they never really recovered.</p>
        <p>Neagle's first pitch of the game produced a broken-bat single, and his second pitch resulted in a bunt single. After three pitches, Neagle furiously rubbed a baseball and waved to the fans in the right-field bleachers who chanted his name. He should have waved for help because it got stickier after his 21-pitch first.</p>
        <p>Neagle told Roger Clemens that he hates having difficult innings early in games because it drains him. Sure enough, four of the first five Royals clubbed hits in the second inning, and three of them scored. Neagle did not have a decent slider or fastball, and he felt helpless while losing for the first time in his four starts as a Yankee.</p>
        <p>''Everyone has those days when they struggle,'' said Neagle, who gave up 3 earned runs and 11 hits in 7 innings. ''I felt like it was going to be one of those days where I battled. I battled and kept us in the game.''</p>
        <p>Not really.</p>
        <p>Because of Stein, the Yankees were barely in the game. So Stein, who entered the game with a 7-13 record and a 5.89 earned run average in his career, topped Neagle, who had been 2-0 with a 2.25 E.R.A. in three starts for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''You scratch your head, you wonder how that could happen, but you watched it firsthand,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said. ''A guy goes out there as big as Stein and he can have his way.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees were perturbed after going 2 for 11 with runners on base against Stein, who also pitched eight innings of one-hit ball against them last Aug. 19.</p>
        <p>Torre and Derek Jeter did not recall Stein's previous gem, and Neagle uttered ''not much'' when asked what he knew about the 6-foot-7-inch right-hander with the jumpy fastball and imposing presence.</p>
        <p>Six of the nine Yankees in the lineup had opposed Stein before, and they were a combined 0 for 19. It was a small sample, and most of the at-bats came in Stein's only appearance against the Yankees 11 months ago. But it proved valid as Stein held the Yankees to 2 hits in 23 at-bats yesterday, even though 60 of his 122 pitches were balls.</p>
        <p>Stein walked Chuck Knoblauch to lead off the game, but Jeter hit into a double play. With a runner on first and two outs in the second inning, Johnny Damon made a sprawling catch of Chris Turner's fly ball.</p>
        <p>A walk and Knoblauch's single put two runners on in the third inning, but right fielder Jermaine Dye leaped into the fence to catch Jeter's 310-foot fly ball.</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill's sacrifice fly scored the Yankees' only run in the eighth. Ricky Bottalico pitched the ninth to save Stein's victory.</p>
        <p>''He threw well, but, in some respects, we let him get away a little bit,'' Scott Brosius said. ''He certainly didn't throw a dominating two-hitter. We had walks, we had base runners and we didn't make anything happen.''</p>
        <p>Still, O'Neill said, ''What we did or didn't do, what he did, anyway you put it, on the scoreboard he threw well.''</p>
        <p>Stein was one of the three pitchers traded from St. Louis to Oakland for Mark McGwire on July 31, 1997, and he was also part of the deal that sent Kevin Appier from the A's to the Royals on July 31, 1999.</p>
        <p>Stein was not dealt on the July 31 trading deadline this season, but he tamed the Yankees two days later. He turns 27 today, and the fans behind the dugout definitely knew who Stein was this time.</p>
        <p>''They were saying, 'Good job, don't ever do it again,' '' Stein said. ''When someone walked in the ninth, they said they'd hate to see me lose this one, but it would be all right. They were pretty complimentary.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>ORLANDO HERNANDEZ and DAVID CONE will rejoin the Yankees tomorrow. Cone is expected to start on Saturday.</p>
        <p>ROGER CLEMENS (5-0, 1.91 E.R.A.) was named the American League's pitcher of the month.</p>
