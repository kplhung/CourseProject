        <p>Former President Gerald R. Ford was admitted to the neurological intensive care unit of Hahnemann University Hospital here today after suffering what doctors said was at least one small stroke over the last three days.</p>
        <p>After a day of tests, he was listed in ''serious and improving'' condition, with the prognosis good for full recovery.</p>
        <p>''The president should totally recover,'' Dr. Robert J. Schwartzman, the hospital's chief neurologist, said in a briefing late this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford, who is 87 and served as the nation's 38th president, was in Philadelphia for the Republican National Convention. Only hours before being admitted to the hospital, near the city's center, he had been given a rousing salute by convention delegates for his brief, generally calming and healing stewardship of the nation in the embarrassing aftermath of Watergate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford arrived at the hospital at about 9 a.m. today, complaining of dizziness, weakness in his left arm and an inability to speak without slurring his words. He was admitted, hospital officials later said, after an imaging scan indicated he had suffered at least one stroke in the brain stem in the rear of his head.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Ford's second visit to the hospital in less than 10 hours, his first having occurred around midnight when, accompanied by his usual Secret Service security detail, he walked in on his own complaining of sinus pain. He was given some pain medicine and released.</p>
        <p>Hospital officials defended their decision to release him without further tests, saying they felt that they had sufficiently responded to the symptoms they saw.</p>
        <p>''All he sought was some pain relief,'' Dr. Wayne Satz, the hospital's chief of emergency medicine, said.</p>
        <p>Asked what was different about the symptoms that led to a sinus infection diagnosis first and later a diagnosis of a stroke, Dr. Satz said the symptoms were more acute in the second hospital visit and that Mr. Ford's wife, Betty, had reported that Mr. Ford had also felt ill earlier in the week.</p>
        <p>On Monday, before heading for Philadelphia, Mrs. Ford told doctors, Mr. Ford saw a doctor in Colorado, complaining then, as later, of head pain.</p>
        <p>In the convention hall on Tuesday night, while Mr. Ford was being honored, he appeared visibly tired and in one interview noticeably slurred his words.</p>
        <p>News that he had been hospitalized injected a somber note into a convention that up to then had been one big joyful celebration of George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Hahnemann doctors said they were treating Mr. Ford with blood-thinners in an effort to diminish the likelihood of future strokes. In someone his age, they emphasized, there was a greater danger of another stroke than in someone younger.</p>
        <p>But a minor stroke is not unusual at that age.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schwartzman said Mr. Ford was ''perfectly awake, functioning mentally -- that's not a problem.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the former president, Calvin McDowell, said Mr. Ford was ''very alert and ready to go home.'' Should he continue to recover without any complications, hospitals officials said, he might be released in five or six days.</p>
        <p>''He is able to take calls,'' Mr. McDowell said, ''but we are trying to insist that he get some rest.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Schwartzman said he did not think Mr. Ford had suffered any brain damage from the stroke.</p>
        <p>''I think this will all clear, mainly in his balance center,'' he added. ''That should all recover.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Thomas Brott of the National Stroke Association, said it was possible that the signs and symptoms Mr. Ford spoke about in his visit to the hospital Tuesday night, when he complained of pain in his face, dizziness and sleeplessness, would not have immediately suggested to doctors that a stroke had occurred. Symptoms described by a patient, Dr. Brott said, are often ambiguous and might point to a cause more likely than a stroke, like an infection.</p>
        <p>On the same point, Dr. Schwartzman said that a mild stroke ''looks like an inner ear infection sometimes, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.''</p>
        <p>A stroke is usually caused by a blood clot blocking a vessel in the brain, so that cells beyond the blockage do not receive nutrients, and can thus be injured or die.</p>
        <p>The cells affected in Mr. Ford's case are in the lower back of the brain where motor activity, like balance, is controlled.</p>
        <p>In many cases, when the stroke is small, the damaged brain cells can recover or the killed cells can be bypassed so that other healthy cells can perform the same function, leading to complete recovery.</p>
