        <p>THE doctor will see you now. So will the only undisputed homegrown Democratic candidate for United States senator from New York.</p>
        <p>Gosh, they're the same chipmunk-cheeked guy, and neither one oozes schmooze. They're operating out of the same Park Avenue war room, a minimal space with an ominous screen for viewing X-rays, a manila folder for keeping track of campaign promises and, in the tradition of doctors' offices everywhere, the sound of toilets being flushed as you cower in the visitor's chair awaiting news about that orthopedic surgery.</p>

        <p>THE doctor will see you now. So will the only undisputed homegrown Democratic candidate for United States senator from New York.</p>
        <p>Gosh, they're the same chipmunk-cheeked guy, and neither one oozes schmooze. They're operating out of the same Park Avenue war room, a minimal space with an ominous screen for viewing X-rays, a manila folder for keeping track of campaign promises and, in the tradition of doctors' offices everywhere, the sound of toilets being flushed as you cower in the visitor's chair awaiting news about that orthopedic surgery.</p>
        <p>But no need now for Dr. Mark S. McMahon, 38, to drum up his bedside manner -- possibly a good thing, as rumor has it that this is not a strong suit with him, except when he's home tending to his three children. Two of whom -- honest! -- attend P.S. 6, one of the city's A-list public schools.</p>
        <p>Our topic is the doctor's obsession: politics, apparently a moth-to-flame thing with him ever since he was elected homeroom president back in elementary school. And even if Hillary Rodham Clinton, wearing the party's halo, treats Dr. McMahon like a nebbish -- ignoring his debate invitations and pretending he's polling-place toast -- he's got news for her.</p>
        <p>He's officially on the ballot and sticking around until the Sept. 12 primary; maybe longer. Sure, he thinks it's fishy that there are suddenly four other insurgents on the ballot, none of whom scraped up the required 15,000 signatures, all of whom could undermine his effort to monopolize the anti-Hillary vote.</p>
        <p>But his mother, Eva, a retired nurse, and his father, Tom, a semi-retired dentist, didn't scavenge the malls and Home Depots of Long Island helping him collect those 44,107 signatures for nothing. So regardless of the decision on his court challenge to the validity of the other party-crashers, he's forging ahead with his no-frills, no-television-commercials, $200,000 (more or less) campaign to heal what ails the Senate by sending it a physician, not another lawyer.</p>
        <p>He doesn't drink, smoke, curse, golf, or philander. (Does this fellow really meet the qualifications to be a Senator from New York?) He's never been arrested, and the closest he's come to the fast track is skipping the 8th and 11th grades at Fordham Prep in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''Maybe that's my problem a little,'' he says about being on the cusp of nerddom. ''I may be just sort of, ah, insipid in that sense. I don't know. I just felt I owed it to my parents to lead sort of an exemplary life.''</p>
        <p>Meet candidate McMahon, the Harvard-educated doctor, vanity-published medical-thriller author and self-confessed goody-two-shoes who insists that not only is candidate Clinton not the people's choice (''I'm shocked at the level of anti-Hillary sentiment that exists'') but that she's absolutely the wrong candidate to combat Rick Lazio (''My biggest gripe with Hillary is that because of her, this seat may end up in Republican hands. Giuliani is replaced by an understudy candidate of limited distinction, and now he's seven points ahead of the other candidate, the most famous woman on the planet, quote, unquote,'' he sputters.)</p>
        <p>HIS handshake is a limp one, but don't hold that against him. Maybe he's saving strength to wield his scalpel -- he's already done six operations today and, like a savvy politician who blueprints names and faces, he demonstrates total, if a tad disinterested, recall. One carpal tunnel release, two tumor removals (benign), three knees scoped. The usual stuff. Frankly, after seven years in private practice, he'd rather be in the Senate making policy than renovating bone matter. He would, he says, be a leader in health care reform, but not a one-issue automaton, not with that 1985 degree from the London School of Economics.</p>
        <p>The McMahon mission in a nutshell: expanded Medicare and services for the elderly; increased research on AIDS and cancer; gun control; capital punishment; rent control; higher minimum wage and teachers' salaries; the sovereignty of Israel's borders. He opposes prayer in public schools, school vouchers, late-term abortion, gay marriage, eliminating affirmative action.</p>
        <p>He did not take a cram course on the issues: this is stuff he thinks about all the time.</p>
        <p>So far his patients haven't rebelled at his alternate career: ''But I could imagine somebody saying 'I want to go to someone who all he thinks about is scoping knees, not this guy who's running for Senate, too.' ''</p>
        <p>Dr. McMahon refuses to attack Mrs. Clinton's political platform (he's waiting for the debate that he says she owes the state's 4.9 million Democrats) and slyly says they even have something in common: ''Neither one of us has held office.'' But he makes short work of Mr. Lazio: ''He's the un-Hillary. What does he stand for? What's his rationale? For example, about Israel, where's he been on that? My sense of him is that there's no there there.''</p>
        <p>Enough air time for Rick Lazio. Let's talk about Mark McMahon. What do you do for fun? ''Spend time with the kids,'' he says. ''I can't understand parents who all they want to do is get away from their kids.'' His are 6, 5 and almost 1 and unaware that daddy is running for Senate. He is, he adds, opposed to ''using them as campaign props.'' And his wife, Lynne, a radiologist at Bellevue Hospital Center, is ''apolitical,'' so he expects no stumping from that quadrant, either.</p>
        <p>''She'll probably vote for Hillary,'' he says. It's his first, and last, joke of the day.</p>
