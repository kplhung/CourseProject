        <p>It's great that Turner Classics Movies has revived many rare old films that were written, directed or produced by women for its Women Film Pioneers series. So I'll take it as a backhanded compliment to women (and interested men, of course) that the cable network is broadcasting many of these 37 films in the middle of the night. Someone must be assuming that all of us know how to program our VCR's.</p>
        <p>The five-week-long series begins, however, in prime time, with an 8 p.m. premiere of a documentary called ''Without Lying Down,'' based on Cari Beauchamp's insightful book about the screenwriter Frances Marion and other powerful women in early Hollywood. Ms. Beauchamp also produced and wrote this spirited piece of work with Bridget Terry, and it will be immediately followed by an overnight retrospective of Marion's films.</p>

        <p>It's great that Turner Classics Movies has revived many rare old films that were written, directed or produced by women for its Women Film Pioneers series. So I'll take it as a backhanded compliment to women (and interested men, of course) that the cable network is broadcasting many of these 37 films in the middle of the night. Someone must be assuming that all of us know how to program our VCR's.</p>
        <p>The five-week-long series begins, however, in prime time, with an 8 p.m. premiere of a documentary called ''Without Lying Down,'' based on Cari Beauchamp's insightful book about the screenwriter Frances Marion and other powerful women in early Hollywood. Ms. Beauchamp also produced and wrote this spirited piece of work with Bridget Terry, and it will be immediately followed by an overnight retrospective of Marion's films.</p>
        <p>Without being sentimental or star-struck, tonight's documentary evokes a comparatively innocent Hollywood after the turn of the century, when movies became the lodestone for writers and actors. Women quickly filled the ranks -- before people figured out how much money there was to be made in the business. Almost half the screenwriters were women, and they weren't relegated to ''women's pictures.'' Bess Meredyth was co-screenwriter of the original ''Ben-Hur.'' Lois Weber, a successful director, ran her own production company.</p>
        <p>This was the world that drew Frances Owens, a young woman from a good San Francisco family who had worked as a photographer's model but had larger ambitions. She headed for Hollywood, sketchbook in hand, and was drawing in a park when the vaudeville star Marie Dressler came by. They had met before, in San Francisco, so it wasn't entirely strange for Dressler to stop and urge Owens to jump into the ''cement mixer'' of the movie business.</p>
        <p>Owens, who soon became Frances Marion during a brief acting career, would have jumped anyway. The woman portrayed in this documentary was adventuresome and extremely talented. She would write the screenplays for more than 150 movies during her career, direct, act and become one of the first women correspondents to go overseas during World War I.</p>
        <p>She was also loyal. When talking pictures arrived, she discovered that her old friend Dressler, who had become a silent movie star, had been dismissed as obsolete and was about to take a job as a housekeeper. By then, Owens-Marion had become one of Hollywood's most prominent screenwriters, assigned to adapt ''Anna Christie'' for Greta Garbo. She wrote a part for her old friend Dressler, whose career was revived in the medium's new incarnation.</p>
        <p>The documentary deftly uses the Frances Marion story to illuminate how she and other women were able to capitalize on the freewheeling creativity that kept the movie business humming in the early years. It helps that this prolific writer left behind plenty of commentary, which the actress Kathy Bates reads with a strong, bright voice, evoking real feeling for Marion and her vigorous outlook.</p>
        <p>The women helped one another. Marion was the host of weekly parties for Hollywood's female producers, writers and actors where they screened their movies and complained about the business. Marion briskly described these relationships like this: ''In the picture business you can spend your life searching for a man to look up to without lying down.''</p>
        <p>Her career was jump-started by her friendship with Mary Pickford, with whom she collaborated on more than a dozen silent movies, many of them adaptations of classic children's literature. It is fascinating to see clips of Pickford, in her 20's, convincingly playing adolescent girls in movies like ''The Little Princess'' and ''Pollyanna.''</p>
        <p>Apart from its historical interest, the documentary cogently discusses Marion's screenwriting skill, using a scene from ''The Scarlet Letter'' starring Lillian Gish to illustrate the challenge of translating prose into a silent film -- and to make a novel about Puritans accessible to a Jazz Age audience. Later, when movies had sound and she was writing ''The Big House,'' her Oscar-winning screenplay about prison life, Marion toured San Quentin and listened to the inmates talk. ''My ears became attuned to their vernacular,'' she reported.</p>
        <p>An elderly Jackie Cooper, recalling the part she wrote for him as a child star in the 1931 film ''The Champ,'' says, ''Everything was so believable, what this boy had to say.''</p>
        <p>Marion's private life had the ingredients for a Hollywood bio-pic -- with her overseas reporting adventures and her loving but tragically curtailed marriage to Fred Thomson, who trained to be a Presbyterian minister but became one of his era's most famous Hollywood cowboys, and died at 38. But she was not self-pitying, even when the business became an industry and women lost their foothold. Lois Weber, who gave Frances Marion her start in the business, died so poor that Marion paid for her funeral. After Marion herself was demoted to script doctor by Louis B. Mayer, she had the wherewithal to turn to painting and sculpture as well as other forms of writing.</p>
        <p>Modern female filmmakers (including the director Martha Coolidge and the producer Polly Platt) comment on Marion's craft and legacy, offering smart analysis but with the earnestness and self-consciousness of our age. They appreciate and perhaps envy Frances Marion, who was from a different time, before the industry hardened, when possibilities seemed endless because it was all new.</p>
        <p>WITHOUT LYING DOWN  Frances Marion and the Power of Women in Hollywood  Turner Classic Movies, tonight at 8</p>
