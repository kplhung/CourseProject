        <p>The Food and Drug Administration said today that it would begin requiring that recycled medical devices originally intended to be used only once meet the same regulatory standards that they did when manufactured.</p>
        <p>The requirements apply both to companies that clean and repackage the devices for subsequent uses and hospitals that do the work themselves. The practice of reusing disposable devices, including catheters, syringes and biopsy needles, has spread in recent years as a cost-cutting measure. It is impossible to say exactly how widespread the practice is, but recycled devices are believed to account for only a very small portion of the medical device market.</p>
        <p>The major reprocessing companies welcomed the regulations, saying they would dispel doubts about the safety of the recycled devices.</p>
        <p>''We think it's a good thing,'' said Ronald Nordquist, the president of  SterilMed Inc. of Minneapolis, a medical device reprocessor. ''It should force people that are substandard out of this industry.''</p>
        <p>Manufacturers have argued that the reuse of devices designed to be  disposable can pose health risks, like infections or breakage, to patients.</p>
        <p>Josephine Torrente, president of the Association of Disposable Device Manufacturers, said the new guidelines did not go far enough. ''The policy has some significant gaps in it,'' Ms. Torrente said.</p>
        <p>Device reprocessors say the manufacturers' concerns are related more to competition and profits than to patient safety.</p>
        <p>''It's an economic issue for them,'' said Pamela Furman, executive director of the Association of Medical Device Reprocessors. ''Their objective from the beginning has been to make reprocessing go away.''</p>
        <p>The reprocessors' association estimates that the annual sales of its members total $20 million, a fraction of the multibillion-dollar medical device market. Boston Scientific, one of the major manufacturers of single-use devices, had sales of nearly $3 billion in 1999.</p>
        <p>Hospitals have cleaned and reused disposable devices for about 20 years, said Larry Spears, an enforcement official with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the F.D.A. Companies specializing in the cleaning and repackaging of single-use devices first appeared about a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Reports like one about a recycled catheter breaking in a patient during surgery led to Congressional hearings on the issue last year and a review by the General Accounting Office.</p>
        <p>Drug agency officials said they started reviewing the issue last year, because more complicated types of disposable devices, like certain kinds of catheters for heart patients, were now being reused.</p>
        <p>''We questioned in our own minds whether those could be effectively reprocessed,'' Mr. Spears said. ''We felt there was a need to look more closely about this.''</p>
        <p>Under the new guidelines, reprocessors and hospitals that clean and reuse devices must register with the F.D.A., and the agency, which has been inspecting reprocessing companies, will also begin inspecting the  reprocessing operations at hospitals.</p>
        <p>If a device required an agency review before being put on the market, then the reprocessed version of the device must now undergo the same review. Depending on the nature of the device, recyclers have 6 to 18 months to submit safety data to the drug agency.</p>
        <p>The manufacturers' association says a gap exists in the guidelines because if a new device did not require F.D.A. approval, the recycled version can also escape review. A biopsy forceps, a device used to collect a small tissue sample for cancer tests, is exempt from reviews, but Ms. Torrente said studies had shown that forceps were particularly difficult to clean.</p>
        <p>''Despite that, they will be reused in patients without F.D.A. review,'' Ms. Torrente said. ''That's an enormous gap in patient protection.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Torrente said a second concern was that the F.D.A. had not yet clarified what data it would require in its reviews. ''Patients deserve to have this review standard made transparent,'' she said. ''We're asking for regulations that will ban all unsafe reprocessing.''</p>
