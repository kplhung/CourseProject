        <p>After opening the 34th season of the Mostly Mozart Festival with a free outdoor concert on Monday at Lincoln Center's Damrosch Park, the conductor Gerard Schwarz took the festival orchestra back to its traditional indoor site, Avery Fisher Hall, to begin the season proper with a sold-out gala concert on Tuesday night. Two of the works, Mozart's ''Prague'' Symphony and the overture to Beethoven's ''Fidelio,'' were repeated from Monday's concert. Playing outside in the thick humidity with heavy amplification must have taken a toll, for the orchestra's performances of those two works in the hall were somewhat careless and poorly balanced.</p>
        <p>The most successful performance came when the pianist Peter Serkin joined the orchestra for Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 19 in F major. Mr. Serkin played this genial and engaging music with his customary fleet fingerwork, rhythmic vigor and elegance. And without exaggerating any element of the music, he made clear just how inventive the concerto is. He boldly called attention to inner voices that nudge the melodic line in unexpected ways, used the pedal to bring an occasional touch of misty obscurity to the surprising harmonic turns, and here and there let a sudden flourish of passage work shoot out during a moment of ambling lyricism. The orchestra and Mr. Schwarz responded with their most tidy and musical playing.</p>

        <p>After opening the 34th season of the Mostly Mozart Festival with a free outdoor concert on Monday at Lincoln Center's Damrosch Park, the conductor Gerard Schwarz took the festival orchestra back to its traditional indoor site, Avery Fisher Hall, to begin the season proper with a sold-out gala concert on Tuesday night. Two of the works, Mozart's ''Prague'' Symphony and the overture to Beethoven's ''Fidelio,'' were repeated from Monday's concert. Playing outside in the thick humidity with heavy amplification must have taken a toll, for the orchestra's performances of those two works in the hall were somewhat careless and poorly balanced.</p>
        <p>The most successful performance came when the pianist Peter Serkin joined the orchestra for Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 19 in F major. Mr. Serkin played this genial and engaging music with his customary fleet fingerwork, rhythmic vigor and elegance. And without exaggerating any element of the music, he made clear just how inventive the concerto is. He boldly called attention to inner voices that nudge the melodic line in unexpected ways, used the pedal to bring an occasional touch of misty obscurity to the surprising harmonic turns, and here and there let a sudden flourish of passage work shoot out during a moment of ambling lyricism. The orchestra and Mr. Schwarz responded with their most tidy and musical playing.</p>
        <p>The soprano Carol Vaness, scheduled to perform in excerpts from Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' with the tenor Vinson Cole, had to withdraw because of the death of her father. Replacing her was the American soprano Christine Brewer, who has been winning attention for her forays into the dramatic soprano repertory. In the great aria in which the character of Leonore pledges to somehow rescue her unjustly imprisoned husband, Florestan, Ms. Brewer displayed vocal richness and clarion tone. Her voice seems not fully secure as yet, especially her top notes, which were a little tight. But she sang with involvement and artistry and has great promise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cole's tenor voice is rather light for this heroic music. Yet he tried to turn this to advantage by singing Florestan's impassioned soliloquy from his prison chamber with a lyricism and poignancy that you seldom encounter. It was an honorable account, and preferable to the bellowing that is sometimes heard from dramatic tenors. But in the end he lacked the requisite power and gravity.</p>
        <p>In these arias and in the final duet, ''O namenlose Freude!,'' sung by Ms. Brewer and Mr. Cole, the orchestra's playing was not solid enough. One is prepared to discount an occasional blooper on the French horn, a notoriously difficult instrument to hold on pitch, especially on humid nights. But the mistakes from the horn section just kept coming.</p>
        <p>The concert ended with a more confident though unexceptional account of Beethoven's ''Leonore'' Overture No. 3. The concerts by the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra have long been popular with audiences. But on this night a notable stream of people kept leaving well before the substantial program had ended.</p>
