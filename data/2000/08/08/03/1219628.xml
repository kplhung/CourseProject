        <p>The Shelburne Museum in Vermont is known for its re-creations of 18th- and 19th-century buildings (it has a one-room schoolhouse) and evocations of early America, like horse-drawn carriages. This summer, the museum opened ''The Fabulous 50's: Welcome Home to Postwar Vermont,'' for which it restored a 1952 six-room ranch house on its 45-acre property. ''In the 1950's, there were waiting lists for dishwashers, blenders, refrigerators and cars,'' Sloane Stephens, managing curator of the museum, said. The consumerist bent is reflected in the true-to-life Vermont kitchen, above, with its 1949 Frigidaire. And those tilted cabinets? They are authentic too, the way the owner built them in 1952. Information: (802) 985-3346 or www.shelburnemuseum.org.</p>
