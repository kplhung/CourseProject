        <p>WHEN Salon.com revamped its Web site in May, readers greeted it with hundreds of e-mail complaints. They criticized the horizontal scrolling, the small type and the headlines that no longer linked directly to articles.</p>
        <p>Within days, Salon's editor, David Talbot, posted a note to readers saying, ''You win!'' and the site reverted to some of its old design.</p>
        <p>The Salon revolt speaks volumes about the growing impatience that Web users are having with constant face lifts of their favorite sites or with sites that are difficult to navigate.</p>
        <p>In the early days of the Internet, users flocked to Web sites with the latest gee-whiz technology, and other sites soon replicated it. Some sites posted Web cameras even if they had nothing to show; others experimented with animation, even if it was of a  construction worker, to alert users that a page was not quite ready.</p>
        <p>Today, the Web ''is much less fashion driven,'' said Jakob Nielsen, a Web-usability consultant at the Nielsen Norman Group, a consulting firm in Mountain View, Calif.</p>
        <p>''In the early days, users embraced change because the Internet wasn't useful,'' Mr. Nielsen said. ''Now they punish change because they need the Web. It's a useful tool.''</p>
        <p>As a result, users expect more of the Internet than simply entertainment. And they easily become frustrated with sites that don't deliver the goods.</p>
        <p>Alycia Eck is using the Internet to look for a used car. Unable to browse the car lots on her own, Ms. Eck searches for pictures on the Web but has found that most Web sites warn that the picture she sees may not be of the actual car. And her e-mail to lenders goes unanswered.</p>
        <p>''I thought it would be like that Saturn commercial where the kid orders a pizza one day from his dorm room and the next day he orders a car,'' Ms. Eck said. ''They haven't taken the time on their Web sites to get me to come in and see the car.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, for the most part, consumers don't trust Web sites to give them the information they need. A common debate among site designers is how much information to put on the home page. Is it easier to scroll down a front page with possibly hundreds of links or to click through several pages?</p>
        <p>Popular home pages are now a mix of a directory and a search engine. The growing consensus is that users want ''the broad and shallow,'' said Louis Rosenfeld, president of Argus Associates, an Ann Arbor, Mich., consulting firm that specializes in organizing Web sites, a field known as information architecture.</p>
        <p>''People don't trust that if the site makes choices for them on the main page, that those would be the ones they would go by if they were clicking through,'' Mr. Rosenfeld said. ''We're finding, rather surprisingly, that they would rather a front page of 100 links.''</p>
        <p>As they did during the early days of the Internet, users still demand speed. That will  become more important, Web designers say, as more users connect to the Internet through their mobile phones, with their small screens and sometimes unreliable service.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the needs of users are becoming more sophisticated. Designers say that customization and anonymity are the two things users want most right now. For example, consumers favor features like My Yahoo and Amazon.com's Recommended lists. So companies are looking for ways to customize their sites for users, but without the usual annoyances, like passwords. Consumers are reluctant to register for sites until the site proves useful, Mr. Nielsen said. ''People don't want to buy into something unless they know they're going to use it often,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The biggest complaint on message boards about Web designs is information overload. Users on the message boards say that companies have concentrated too much on design and content and not enough on how the information is structured.</p>
        <p>For the most part, users say, search engines on sites are unreliable. Either the search results yield too many choices, with useless ones at top, or some sites have employed broad-based search engines, like Google, that traverse the whole Web instead of just the particular site.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Nielsen said, users want a site that is designed to help them find what they want, not what the marketing department wants to promote.</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, a woman was trying to describe to a friend bedding she had seen in a Garnet Hill catalog. So the woman, Denise Russo, decided to try the company's Web site. She had even planned to place an order, but she said she had to ''click through what seemed like 700 pages to get the picture I was looking for, and then it was too small and I couldn't enlarge it.''</p>
        <p>''The whole experience was way too annoying,'' Ms. Russo added. ''I'm never going back there.''</p>
        <p>Unlike magazine or book editors, site designers are hampered by a lack of commonly agreed upon conventions on the Web. Some similarities in Web designs are emerging. For example, nearly every publicly held company has an investor-relations area on its Web site where users can quickly find the latest press releases, annual report and stock information.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rosenfeld said he doubted that Web users would ever see similarities on the Web like the chapters and indexes they find in books.</p>
        <p>''A book is a self-contained information space, and it's finite,'' Mr. Rosenfeld said. ''A Web site could be designed in any way the human mind could imagine.''</p>
        <p>At least 90 percent of Web sites need to be redesigned in some way, said Mr. Nielsen, the Web usability consultant. But most Web sites, he added, are not redesigned for the right reasons. In the early days of the Internet, sites were redesigned every few months to take advantage of the latest technology. Now a site may be changed simply because a designer is bored with it or because a company executive had a problem with it. Few companies test their sites with users, Mr. Nielsen said, or if they do, they ignore the advice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nielsen suggests subtle redesigns and encourages companies to explain how to perform old functions on the new site. For example, when eBay revamped its auto auction site in April, canceling some of its previous auction categories, it touched off a spate of complaints from users who had listed their items during the switch.</p>
        <p>''This is the worst mistake that eBay has made,'' a customer wrote on the site's message board. ''I hope that someone at eBay has the foresight to listen to its sellers and buyers and change it back.'' The company later made changes.</p>
        <p>At Salon, the editors say that 90 percent of the redesigned site is still intact, including a new color scheme, a navigation bar across the top of the page, a switch to four columns from three and a search box on every page. And Salon editors say the negative reaction to the redesign will not discourage them from redesigning again in a year or two.</p>
        <p>''People have an understandable and justifiable preference for what they're accustomed to,'' said Scott Rosenberg, vice president of site development and managing editor of Salon. ''They don't want to be bothered to learn new ways of doing things -- and unless you can make clear to them that a new way is superior to the old, familiar way, why should they?''</p>
