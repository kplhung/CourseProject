        <p>The parliamentary elections are over, but in the rustling fields, black squatters are still occupying a thousand white-owned farms. And even the governing party acknowledges that ''criminal elements'' have been causing havoc on some farms.</p>
        <p>Today, the opposition alliance of black union members and white business owners brought the nation to a standstill as thousands of black employees stayed home from work, and white industrialists shut banks and stores to protest the farm invasions.</p>
        <p>President Robert Mugabe, whose party won a narrow majority in Parliament a month ago, buoyed by his promise to redistribute land, has refused to remove the squatters, despite several court orders.</p>
        <p>But he seemed to bow to the pressure today. He said the squatters would leave most farms in a month,  as the government completes its redistribution plan. ''We will, in the process, be removing all war veterans from the rest of the farms that will not be resettled,'' Mr. Mugabe said at a news conference. ''The time frame? I cannot be that exact. But certainly I want to say within this month.''</p>
        <p>But here, on a sprawling tobacco farm an hour from the capital, there is no sign of change. Squatters armed with machetes disturb the uneasy peace. And it seems increasingly clear that Mr. Mugabe is willing to do whatever is necessary to remake the hated colonial map that left the tiny white minority in control of more than half the country's fertile land.</p>
        <p>This week, government officials stunned the white farmers' union and foreign donors with an announcement that they would soon redistribute more than 3,000 white-owned farms, half the white commercial farm land, to 500,000 peasant families.</p>
        <p>''You're living in a state of anarchy,'' said Bob Sherriffs, 33, whose family farm here has been occupied by black squatters and earmarked for acquisition. ''You're living in a state of fear. One minute you feel it will all come right. The next minute you feel, 'Is there any hope for us?' ''</p>
        <p>Officials close to Mr. Mugabe said he was focused on his legacy, determined to go down in history as the liberation hero, as the man who wrested the land from the whites, who make up less than 2 percent of the population, and returned it to the blacks. So this time, the squatters on the farm here did not disappear after the election. They came back in bare feet and fraying clothes, determined to sleep at the foot of Mr. Sherriffs's family property until they had their own piece of land.</p>
        <p>The adversaries, white and black, stood side by side, with Mr. Sherriffs on one side and the squatters on the other, with everyone smiling their polite good mornings in the awkward detente that has become an accepted daily ritual.</p>
        <p>Zarimba Zarimba, 24, a squatter who has been living on the farm since April, said he believed that the battle would soon be over. Soon, he said, the whites will return the land that was stolen from his ancestors decades ago. Soon, he said, he will be tilling his own potatoes, tobacco and corn. He hopes the transfer will be peaceful, he added, but he is ready to fight.</p>
        <p>''The nation wants land,'' Mr. Zarimba said. ''We will not leave until we are all satisfied.''</p>
        <p>The pointed outrage of the white farmers and the steely determination of government officials often mask a complicated reality. High-ranking officials at the white farmers' union are well aware that the 3,000 farms represent two million acres of land, the very acreage of underused land that the union and Western donors have agreed should be given over to landless peasants.</p>
        <p>Although the farmers have serious concerns about whether the farms were properly selected, Westerners say union officials have repeatedly promised and failed to deliver their own list of underused farms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mugabe, on the other hand, likes to fault whites for the slow pace of land reform while his government has lacked the will, the capacity and the cash to make redistribution a reality. Over the years, his promises of speedy redistribution were viewed as hollow campaign pledges that ushered in the start of each election season and faded out after the votes had been counted.</p>
        <p>But now, after 20 years in power, Mr. Mugabe, 76, seems to feel a sense of urgency. He has watched his popularity plummet. In June, his party lost its overwhelming dominance in Parliament for the first time since 1980, when the nation voted in a new opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change.</p>
        <p>Today, he watched the capital become a ghost town as ordinary citizens ignored the state-controlled media's call for people to report to work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mugabe has been taking several steps to respond to his critics. This week, the government finally devalued the Zimbabwe dollar, a move that was quickly applauded. Last month, Mr. Mugabe formed a cabinet that now includes several highly respected business leaders.</p>
        <p>Also today, Mr. Mugabe gave President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa assurances that the government would deal with the lawlessness on the farms. ''It's a matter that we discussed,'' said Mr. Mbeki, who was visiting Mr. Mugabe and said he believed that the issue would be resolved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mbeki has heard that promise before. In April, Mr. Mugabe told Mr. Mbeki that he would bring an end to the violence on the farms. In fact, the violence intensified and further alienated Western donors, who are desperately needed to rescue the flailing economy.</p>
