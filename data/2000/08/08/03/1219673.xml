        <p>DROWNING RUTH  By Christina Schwarz  338 pages. Doubleday. $23.95.</p>
        <p>An eerie, watery death is at the heart of ''Drowning Ruth,'' and the only reliable witness was 3 years old when it happened. What's more, Ruth Neumann's memory of the event seems to have played some strange tricks. Ruth remembers the night her mother, Mathilda, fell through the ice on a frozen lake, and she knows her mother drowned there. But she also clings to the peculiar thought that somehow, she herself drowned, too.</p>
        <p>Christina Schwarz, the author of this suspenseful, unusually well-crafted first novel, cleverly contrasts Ruth's impressions with those of her aunt, Amanda Starkey, whose recollections are darker. On the night in 1919 when her sister died, not long after their mother and father succumbed to influenza, Amanda wound up with a bite mark on one hand, and the book creates a sinister sense of how it got there. ''Who would have thought she would struggle so fiercely?'' Amanda later thinks to herself. ''I found my father's whiskey and dabbed a little on my wounds. Then I drank a glass. People said it made you forget.''</p>
        <p>It's clear from the start, in a book that intersperses Amanda's and Ruth's voices with a predominant third-person narrative, that Ms. Schwarz can make a great deal out of the mystery of what really happened. Sparingly and expertly, in a richly textured book with an enveloping sense of the sisters' Wisconsin farm life, she doles out the details. It develops that Carl Neumann, Mathilda's husband and Ruth's father, was away in the army when his wife died, and that he must depend on Amanda for an explanation.</p>
        <p>It also develops that the strain of keeping a lid on her emotions is enough to land Amanda in a psychiatric asylum soon afterward. ''After all, it must have been hard for her,'' thinks Clement Owens, a married man whose involvement with Amanda becomes one of the book's most volatile ingredients. ''All those deaths, the parents, then the sister. Anyone might crack.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Schwarz is able to deploy a line like that in casually chilling fashion, so that the book stirs up powerful undercurrents of foreboding. And she fuses this suspense with such strong period detail that ''Drowning Ruth'' creates a visceral sense of the forces that constrain its women's lives. ''My mother's dresses smelled of lavender water,'' Amanda recalls, with typical attention to evocative particulars. ''She kept them perfectly, the sleeves and bodices stuffed with paper to hold their shape, old shawls draped over their shoulders to keep the dust off. It looked as if there were six copies of my mother in the wardrobe, each without a head.''</p>
        <p>No less frozen, in her own way, is Amanda, whose options in the Wisconsin of 1919 are severely limited by her spinster status and who clings desperately to her new role as Ruth's surrogate mother. Throughout a book whose abundant plot twists would be spoiled by too much discussion here, Amanda behaves in ways that make her motherly side frighteningly apparent. She wants Ruth. She wants Carl out of the way. And maybe she wanted her sister out of the way, too. When Ruth grows up and becomes close to a girlfriend named Imogene, her aunt's most agonizing maternal instincts are put to the test.</p>
        <p>With deft pacing and a clear, vivid evocation of its principal setting (the family farm and the isolated nearby island where Mathilda drowned), Ms. Schwarz's homespun-sounding book has a noticeably cinematic style. So Wes Craven, the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' director who showed a surprising flair for the womanly aspects of ''Music of the Heart,'' is scheduled to bring it to the screen, no doubt drawn to such frissons as the sudden sight of Mathilda frozen in the lake, ''the blue eyes staring, the mouth open, screaming without sound, trapped in that bottomless black hole.'' Other nicely horrific aspects include the book's hint of reincarnation, its stirrings of a revenge plot and the mountingly Gothic tone of Ruth's traumatic memories: ''Under the bed was where to go the day the noises were scary. . . . Under the bed is a good place to hide when you hear the screaming, when you hear the breathing, when you hear the 'God, oh, God, oh, God.' ''</p>
        <p>But in the end, the real shock in ''Drowning Ruth'' is the realization of how deeply its story of sisterly love and rivalry supplants everything else. In an ambitious book that sees its characters through to 1941, moving from suspense-tinged, romantically rustic farm life (meals of bacon and turnips, honeysuckle and black-eyed susan braided into wreaths, a local cheesemaker having excellent luck with white cheddar) into the more urbane lives of the next generation, the full meaning of Amanda and Mathilda's final struggle is saved for the story's revelatory ending. In this assured last stroke, Ms. Schwarz affirms the psychological underpinnings of a book that would have worked page-turningly well as a straightforward mystery alone. She gives it the extra wisdom that marks ''Drowning Ruth'' as the chilling, precociously good start to a bright new novelist's career.</p>
