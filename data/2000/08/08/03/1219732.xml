        <p>The criminal case against two state troopers that is at the heart of New Jersey's racial profiling scandal has been rocked by the discovery of two new witnesses who support the accounts of the troopers, who are accused of attempted murder for shooting three unarmed minority men on the New Jersey Turnpike.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the troopers, John Hogan and James Kenna, said they were told Friday and again Monday that state prosecutors had told them that they had found two new witnesses and that the witness accounts backed the officers' version of the April 1998 shooting.</p>
        <p>As a result, the state has persuaded a judge to wait until Sept. 7 to rule on a defense motion to dismiss the charges; the judge, Andrew J. Smithson of Superior Court, had planned to issue the decision on Thursday. A hearing on the new evidence is scheduled for Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>James Gerrow, the state's special prosecutor in the case, acknowledged today that there was new evidence but would not discuss it in detail.</p>
        <p>''I'm not even confirming that it involves witnesses,'' Mr. Gerrow said in an interview. ''I told them that new evidence has come to the attention of the state and that it may very well impact on the indictments or on a portion of the indictments, and so I asked the judge for additional time to complete the investigation of the evidence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hogan and Mr. Hall were indicted last year on charges of attempted murder for firing 11 shots into a van they had stopped on the  turnpike. The police maintained that they had fired in self-defense after the driver backed up and struck Trooper Hogan.</p>
        <p>Three of the van's four occupants, who were all young black or Hispanic men from New York City, were wounded.</p>
        <p>The incident coincided with increasingly detailed charges that New Jersey state troopers were singling out minority drivers for traffic stops -- a practice state officials were eventually forced to admit -- and Mr. Hogan and Mr. Kenna were held up by the state's critics as examples of the racial profiling scandal. In the wake of the shooting, Carl A. Williams, the state police superintendent, was fired by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman after he defended taking race into account in making some drug-related traffic stops.</p>
        <p>The troopers said that they had pulled the van over for speeding, but an analysis of the time stamp on the driver's toll ticket and the distance driven indicated that the vehicle could not have been traveling much over the speed limit.</p>
        <p>The troopers were indicted and suspended without pay, largely on the testimony of the only witness identified so far, a bicyclist who testified that from a nearby overpass he saw the troopers keep firing after the van had stopped backing up.</p>
        <p>Although the emergence of new evidence appears to help the troopers' defense, neither of their lawyers acted very pleased today. Instead, they accused the prosecutor of knowing about the new witnesses for months and of withholding this information during the defense's preparation for trial.</p>
        <p>''He keeps saying this is newly discovered evidence, but my inclination is that he's known about it for months and months and months,'' said Robert Galantucci, Mr. Hogan's lawyer. ''I'm just about convinced that they breached their obligation to provide me with any exculpatory information.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerrow, the special prosecutor, said he had been prompt in notifying the defense about the new evidence. ''I have been very candid with the defense,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jack Arseneault, the lawyer for Mr. Kenna, said he was told about the new witnesses on Friday, with additional information handed him on Monday. But he said neither he nor Mr. Galantucci had been told the identity of the new witnesses or the reason it took two years for them to come forward.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arseneault speculated that the witnesses had been among those stuck in the traffic that piled up on the turnpike after the incident occurred.</p>
        <p>''And I'm quite certain that that if there were these two people who saw what happened, there have got to be hordes of others who saw the same thing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arseneault said he objected to the judge's postponing Thursday's scheduled ruling on the motion to dismiss without first letting the defense see the new evidence.</p>
        <p>''Why raise this new information at the 11th hour?'' Mr. Arseneault asked in an interview. ''Let the judge make the ruling on the record extant now, and if this new evidence is exculpatory, then let there be further rulings later on.''</p>
        <p>The motion to dismiss is based on defense charges of prosecutorial misconduct during grand jury proceedings, and, at the hearing on Aug. 31, the two defense lawyers will presumably focus heavily on the question of how long the state knew of the new evidence.</p>
        <p>''This just supports my view that they're just running rampant,'' Mr. Galantucci said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arseneault agreed. ''All these new facts should be put before the grand jury,'' he said. ''It's not up to the prosecutor to cherry-pick now as to which facts should be part of the case and which ones shouldn't be.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Arseneault said, the new break in the case -- if it proves to be a break -- has been about the only good news the two troopers have received since their indictment last year. ''I will say things are looking better now than they did a week ago,'' he said.</p>
