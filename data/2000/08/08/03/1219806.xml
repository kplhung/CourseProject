        <p>For customers in New York City and Westchester County, trying to get a candid explanation for a sharp increase in electricity rates has been a complicated game of who's to blame, with the parties involved pointing fingers at one another. The explanation was no less elusive yesterday as state legislators questioned regulators, power producers and Consolidated Edison.</p>
        <p>One thing, however, was clear from yesterday's hearings: regardless of who is at fault, customers have made it clear in a flurry of complaints that they are fed up.</p>
        <p>All told, the average electricity bill for New York City and Westchester County residents this summer is expected to be 30 percent more than last summer's average, officials said. The average June bill jumped 43 percent compared with last year, city officials said.</p>
        <p>But Eugene R. McGrath, the chairman and chief executive of Consolidated Edison, pleaded with legislators to stop looking to his company for answers. Since deregulation began in New York State, Mr. McGrath noted, Con Edison has been forced to sell most of its power plants and no longer controls the cost of producing power, the part that he said has caused customers' bills to increase.</p>
        <p>Blaming the new Con Edison, he said, was akin to getting upset with the delivery man when a farmer decides to double the price of milk.</p>
        <p>''Our rates are going down,'' Mr. McGrath said, noting that Con Edison's part of the bill, which covers distribution of the electricity, has decreased 17 percent since 1980. ''On the supply side, rates are going up, and I think we need to better understand what is going on in the market.''</p>
        <p>Legislators said they were concerned that businesses would soon be passing on the cost of higher electric rates to their customers. Officials from the National Supermarket Association said that those costs would be likely to show up on grocery bills.</p>
        <p>''No one can absorb such a large increase in their electricity costs and not pass it on to consumers,'' said Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist for the National Supermarket Association, a group of independent grocery stores in New York.</p>
        <p>Legislators expressed concern that the higher costs could mean the  loss of electricity for poor, elderly and disabled people who are unable to pay. Yesterday, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, who last month called for the hearing, said in an interview that the ''spike threatens the economic and physical health of New Yorkers.''</p>
        <p>While legislators grilled officials and tried to place the blame on Con Ed and the Pataki administration's oversight of deregulation, conspicuously absent from the hearing was the group that might be able to explain the increase in rates: executives from the companies that produce power. A legislative aide who insisted on anonymity said that the executives were invited only at the last minute, adding that the misstep was a sign of how even legislators were even struggling to grasp how the new system works.</p>
        <p>Under deregulation, Con Ed was forced to sell most of its power plants to unregulated companies that could set prices based on market rates. Con Ed now makes money by transmitting power from the plants to customers. The higher costs are on the generation side, which is now virtually unregulated.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGrath said that he did not know why power providers, who own the plants, had increased prices. He said it appeared that the higher costs of gasoline and oil, fuels used to run most power plants downstate, explained about half the rise. But it is unclear what is causing the rest of the increase, Mr. McGrath added.</p>
        <p>Representatives of the power providers did not explain the increase other than to say that demand was outpacing supply.</p>
        <p>Maureen O. Helmer, chairwoman of the State Public Service Commission, defended the Pataki administration's oversight of deregulation. She and Mr. McGrath said that the Legislature must encourage the building of new power plants.</p>
        <p>''Just as increased supply reduces the price for milk, oranges or telephone service, the placement of power plants in New York City will reduce upward pressure on prices and increases the reliability of the city's supply,'' Ms. Helmer said.</p>
