        <p>ANCIENT Persia with a touch of jazz has sprung to life at the new Malcolm X Plaza in Manhattan, where there are paving stones in Islamic geometric patterns, flowers that once bloomed in Persian gardens and a grove of trees in the middle of what used to be concrete and asphalt. (If the city art commission approves, there will also someday be green Art Deco-style benches that hark back to the Harlem Renaissance.)</p>
        <p>The tiny plaza, only 100 by 200 feet, which is due to open officially at a ribbon cutting on Saturday at 11 a.m., sits jauntily on the complex intersection of St. Nicholas Avenue, Malcolm X Boulevard and 110th Street, at the northern end of Central Park.</p>
        <p>People who have long come out of the subway stop on this corner and teetered on the edge of traffic coming from all directions just might pinch themselves to make sure they aren't seeing a mirage.</p>
        <p>''It was just a bare patch of asphalt with no trees,'' said John Reddick, the project manager for the Cityscape Institute, a nonprofit design group that  halted a city design for the new plaza after it had already gone out to bid. ''It was the tail end of six years of work on Malcolm X Boulevard, from subway and sewer improvements to a broader street, and they wanted to be done with it. We wanted a bigger vision for the project.''</p>
        <p>The city design was ''90 percent paving and asphalt pavers,'' he continued, with trees down the center that obscured the views up the wide avenues. ''We wanted to open up those key sightlines,'' said Mr. Reddick, who praised the city architects, engineers and the art commission for agreeing to another go-round on ideas.</p>
        <p>With a generous $500,000 appropriation from  Councilman Bill Perkins, who dipped into his discretionary fund for capital improvements to beef up the city's $300,000 budget, an entirely new plaza was born.</p>
        <p>Now, a little grove of catalpa trees, set in triangular planters, and a large triangular bed of white and yellow roses have the uncanny effect of following both the diagonal line of St. Nicholas Avenue and the north-south alignment of Malcolm X Boulevard, thus framing the views of both wide streets.</p>
        <p>''The skewed axis of St. Nicholas Avenue forms an 'X' with Malcolm X Boulevard, and all components of the plaza take on this 30- or 60-degree angle,'' said the landscape architect Ken Smith, who designed the plaza, in collaboration with Zevilla Jackson of Jackson-Preston Design. The entire plaza plays with the triangular axis.</p>
        <p>Organizing space around an axis harks back to Persian paradise garden traditions, Mr. Smith said, and the resulting triangular patterns were considered sacred geometry.</p>
        <p>Earth tones of brown, black, tan, terra cotta and slate green spread at his feet in geometric patterns that seemed to change before your eyes.</p>
        <p>''It depends on your viewing angle,'' Mr. Smith said, as the multicolored pavers, each one a parallelogram, shifted from stars to flowers to ziggurats that marched toward the subway station and the streets beyond.</p>
        <p>Building a plaza over a subway station (the Seventh Avenue express stops here) was not easy. Trees are planted in raised beds, with planting pits of ''structural soil'' -- a mixture of aggregate, topsoil and compost -- extending three feet below the surface.</p>
        <p>Continuous tree pits -- 10 feet wide and 3 feet deep, paved with granite blocks set in sand -- will be planted all the way up Malcolm X Boulevard to 117th Street. They should serve as a beautiful example of how to plant street trees in the city.</p>
        <p>Malcolm X Plaza is part of a trilogy of commemorative public spaces extending along 110th Street, with the statue of Duke Ellington at Fifth Avenue and a yet-to-be-built memorial on the western edge of the park at Frederick Douglass Circle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reddick said: ''Malcolm X Boulevard cost $50 million -- without any graceful finished project that speaks to the community. This is a defining entrance to Harlem.'' The designers left a generous space on the north side of the plaza for a future piece of art.</p>
        <p>There will also be tables and chairs when people get coffee and goodies from Make My Cake, the new bakery  on the corner of St. Nicholas Avenue and 110th Street. The benches, should they be approved, can be straddled, lounged on like an Art Deco sofa, or used to play cards or write a letter or  read a book. Councilman Perkins was cheered by the vision of the once forlorn corner bustling with life.</p>
        <p>''It's the first thing you see when you go to work in the morning,'' he said. ''It affects how people enter that station, their emotional state, their sense of peace.''</p>
        <p>The plantings include hardy old-fashioned yellow day lilies, white and yellow shrub roses and white Iberis, or candytuft, all of which are fragrant. Some, like the Persian yellow roses and the lilies, were considered sacred elements of the paradise gardens.</p>
        <p>No plant blooms before May 19, Malcolm X's birthday. The yellow Topaz and the white Blanc Double de Coubert roses begin blooming in late May, along with the Iberis, followed by the large clusters of creamy flowers of the catalpa trees in mid-June. Then come the day lilies, which bloom into August, followed by the autumn rebloom of the roses and Iberis. The catalpa, an underused tree with beautiful large leaves, produces long showy pods that dangle from the bare branches all winter.</p>
        <p>''I saw them planted at the edge of Olmsted's Long Meadow in Prospect Park,'' Mr. Smith said, evoking America's father of city parks, Frederick Law Olmsted. ''The texture of the leaves brought them forward from the rest of the park. And I think they'll do the same thing here.'' So, this little bosque, which recalls the sacred fruit groves of paradise gardens, will stand forward from the lovely old ginkgo trees edging Central Park.</p>
