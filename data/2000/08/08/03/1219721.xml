        <p>The genome of the bacterium that causes cholera has been decoded, paving the way for devising better vaccines and drugs against a major killer, which has caused seven pandemics since 1817.</p>
        <p>With the genome sequenced, all of the 3,885 genes found in the bacterium's inventory are now open for inspection, giving biologists the basis for understanding every detail of the microbe's evolution and its tricks for surviving in such different conditions as the open ocean and the human gut.</p>
        <p>The genome was sequenced by the Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville, Md., and is described in an article published today in the journal Nature.</p>
        <p>The bacterium turns out to have 4,033,460 units of DNA, arranged in two circular chromosomes. The larger chromosome has the usual housekeeping genes, which are similar to those of E. coli, a common and usually harmless inhabitant of the human gut. The smaller chromosome seems to contain many of the genetic elements that make the cholera organism pathogenic.</p>
        <p>Dr. John J. Mekalanos, a microbiologist at Harvard University, said he had used the cholera genome to make a gene expression chip, a device that tests when any of the bacterium's genes are active. The chip should help determine which genes are switched on when the bacterium is growing in the human intestine. Such knowledge may pinpoint ways to attack the bacterium, Dr. Mekalanos said.</p>
        <p>The cholera bacterium belongs to a family of microbes known as Vibrio, which are found everywhere in the world's oceans. Most are harmless, and the expression chip may help determine how Vibro cholerae, the causative agent of the disease, acquired the means to infect people.</p>
        <p>Pathogenicity seems to have arisen at least twice in history. Most of the known cholera pandemics were caused by a strain of the bacterium that has now disappeared and has been replaced by a new strain, the El Tor variety, Dr. Mekalanos said. The El Tor strain is the one whose genome has now been sequenced.</p>
        <p>Dr. Claire M. Fraser, director of the Institute for Genomic Research, said the genome work had cost $740,000 and was financed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>
