        <p>FOR adults with aging or infirm parents, determining what type of care their parents need can be a complicated, multilayered process. Several new sites, like AccentCare.com and CareThere.com, help families do that and even keep daily or weekly track of the care their relatives are receiving.</p>
        <p>AccentCare.com, of Irvine, Calif., started a Web site in May that helps consumers determine the appropriate care through an online questionnaire about the relative's  medical history, independence in daily activities and mental state. The company offers services only to California and Arizona residents but is forming affiliate agreements with agencies in other states. (The agencies will be listed on the Web site.) If it is determined that the relative can remain at home, AccentCare refers California and Arizona residents to care providers from its own 13 branches or an affiliate agency.</p>

        <p>FOR adults with aging or infirm parents, determining what type of care their parents need can be a complicated, multilayered process. Several new sites, like AccentCare.com and CareThere.com, help families do that and even keep daily or weekly track of the care their relatives are receiving.</p>
        <p>AccentCare.com, of Irvine, Calif., started a Web site in May that helps consumers determine the appropriate care through an online questionnaire about the relative's  medical history, independence in daily activities and mental state. The company offers services only to California and Arizona residents but is forming affiliate agreements with agencies in other states. (The agencies will be listed on the Web site.) If it is determined that the relative can remain at home, AccentCare refers California and Arizona residents to care providers from its own 13 branches or an affiliate agency.</p>
        <p>Although AccentCare does not refer registered nurses, it offers services like grocery shopping, coordinating of doctor visits and keeping track of the client's medication. It's possible to arrange the care online, but most people choose to call a care manager to talk about obtaining references and scheduling hours.</p>
        <p>Once care is arranged, AccentCare sends updates to family members from reports filled out by the care provider.</p>
        <p>''AccentCare is unique in that they own the brick-and-mortar centers,'' said Rachel Terrace, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York. ''But the challenge will be maintaining quality control of their staff as they expand into other states.'' AccentCare has 1,300 employees.</p>
        <p>Caryn Jacoby, a sales executive in New York, has hired several AccentCare employees to take care of her mother, who lives in San Francisco and has Alzheimer's disease. (In June, AccentCare acquired the Tammy DeCarlo Agency in San Francisco, the agency Ms. Jacoby had been using since 1997.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacoby said she usually talked to her mother once a day and was setting up a family page with AccentCare to keep in touch with the care provider. ''I can't talk to the caregiver without her thinking something is wrong,'' Ms. Jacoby said, ''so this is a way of finding out what's going on directly.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacoby said that because she was often out of the office for many hours each day, staying in contact with the care provider via e-mail would also make her life easier. ''The fact that I can e-mail someone with a question and have it returned that day is wonderful,'' she said. ''I'll be able to do it from home and from work.''</p>
        <p>Kenneth Kleinberg, a health analyst with the Gartner Group, based in Stamford, Conn., said wireless communications would further help care providers stay in contact with their agency and relatives of their client. ''There's a huge boon to the caregiver with wireless devices, and it's long in coming,'' he said. ''Handheld devices will let them check in on the spot.''</p>
        <p>But the concept of families keeping tabs on the care their parent's receive, even if they live across the country, will have to be backed by service agreements, Mr. Kleinberg added. ''It should be understood that the caregiver will read an e-mail within a few hours, not after a few days,'' he said.</p>
        <p>AccentCare is also talking with companies that keep electronic medical records about involving doctors in online communications, said Joe Davis, president of AccentCare. The family member viewing updates from the caregiver on his page, for example, could also receive updates from doctors after visits. ''The capability is there, but for whatever privacy or liability reasons, the medical community has so far been slow to adopt,'' Mr. Davis said.</p>
        <p>CareThere.com, a site based in Mountainview, Calif., started in July and offers decision-making help in the form of legal and financial information, and forums where people can exchange information and advice. CareThere offers lists of specific resources, as AccentCare does, but it doesn't own any of the care agencies it lists.</p>
        <p>Dr. George Savage, president and chief executive of CareThere, said the site was designed to let relatives of patients rate the care being given. Elder-care agencies will be able to display their quality ratings in CareThere's directory.</p>
        <p>''The caregiving industry is so fragmented,'' Dr. Savage said, ''and there's such an imbalance with demand and supply that people who aren't that good go from job to job making the same money. This will be a good way to rate individual caregivers.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Savage said CareThere also serves as a place for care agencies to send e-mail updates to families. ''In the past, it's been nearly impossible to get feedback from an agency because it's so labor intensive,'' he said. ''Now, as the agency types in a report, part of that can be sent as an e-mail message to the family.''</p>
        <p>Companies like AccentCare that refer care providers from businesses they own or from affiliates might exclude other resources available to consumers, said Kathleen Kelly, executive director of the Family Caregiver Alliance, a nonprofit group in San Francisco that publishes a directory of care resources available in California. ''My observation is that most of the caregiver sites that are trying to create a large-scale national database don't always include state-funded or community-based programs,'' she said. ''They're a good starting place, but they won't meet the needs of everyone.''</p>
        <p>Such sites should not be the sole resource for finding support, said Suzanne Mintz, president and co-founder of the National Family Caregiver's Association, a nonprofit organization in Kensington, Md. ''Once you get the name of a company, you still need to get references and ask questions about your own particular needs,'' she said.</p>
        <p>At the very least, Ms. Mintz said, the decision-making tools on sites like CareThere and AccentCare help people to think about what kind of care their parents need or may need in the future.</p>
        <p>''People are beginning to understand that at some point, elder care is going to be part of their family's life,'' she said. ''The caregiver sites help you think about planning ahead.''</p>
