      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The World Health Organization has issued a report detailing an ambitious, often covert effort by the tobacco industry to curb global anti-smoking initiatives, dating back to the late 1980's. The campaign's strategy consisted of having ostensibly independent surrogates attack the credibility of international health organizations and spin the concern with smoking as a first-world issue not worthy of the developing world's attention.</p>
        <p>The W.H.O. report, written partly by Dr. David Kessler, the former federal food and drug commissioner, relies on tobacco company documents that surfaced in recent lawsuits. It accuses the companies of creating bogus front groups, misrepresenting research, pitting other international organizations against the W.H.O., and lobbying to cut the organization's funding.</p>

        <p>The World Health Organization has issued a report detailing an ambitious, often covert effort by the tobacco industry to curb global anti-smoking initiatives, dating back to the late 1980's. The campaign's strategy consisted of having ostensibly independent surrogates attack the credibility of international health organizations and spin the concern with smoking as a first-world issue not worthy of the developing world's attention.</p>
        <p>The W.H.O. report, written partly by Dr. David Kessler, the former federal food and drug commissioner, relies on tobacco company documents that surfaced in recent lawsuits. It accuses the companies of creating bogus front groups, misrepresenting research, pitting other international organizations against the W.H.O., and lobbying to cut the organization's funding.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most alarming, the report alleges that some consultants served both the W.H.O. and the tobacco industry. It exhorts international health organizations, and their member states, to develop strong safeguards against such conflicts of interest.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kessler and the three international experts who also contributed to the report were unable to ascertain the extent to which this industry campaign is still being waged. But Philip Morris, one of the companies cited, said that the tactics depicted in the report were the product of a polarized environment in the past and did not reflect an approach that the company would adopt today.</p>
        <p>Even so, the W.H.O. report should be read as a cautionary tale as the health organization starts negotiations in October to frame an international tobacco-control treaty. Negotiators must remain alert lest the beleaguered industry, under assault in the American market, seek treaty language that would leave consumers unprotected in less sophisticated markets overseas.</p>
