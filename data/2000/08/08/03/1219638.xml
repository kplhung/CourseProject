        <p>THEY say a boat is a hole in the water you dump money into, and Billy Joel has emptied his wallet many times.</p>
        <p>''It's a disease,'' he said last week from the deck of his 65-foot yacht, the Islander, moored in East Hampton's Three Mile Harbor. ''I don't know how I'd kick it.''</p>
        <p>It's unlikely he'll ever try. Long before stepping into the recording studio and selling more than 100 million records, Mr. Joel began his nautical career by swimming out to other people's moorings off the North Shore and ''borrowing'' their  boats. He has owned many since and now also lures other millionaires into the boater's morass with a high-end speedboat he helped design, called the Shelter Island Runabout -- with a base price of $300,000. A stereo to blast Mr. Joel's sentimental song of the sea, ''The Downeaster 'Alexa,' '' will set you back an additional $1,900.</p>
        <p>This day, under an extraordinary blue sky, Mr. Joel, 51, hopped barefoot about the deck of his yacht as though his true calling were the sea, not MTV. Peter Needham, who builds the 36-foot runabouts, had just roared across Gardiners Bay in one to take the singer to lunch. Mr. Joel busied himself catching lines so he and Trish Bergin, a  29-year-old Channel 12 news reporter who shares his stateroom these days, could board. Then he paused to smile down at the speedboat like a proud parent, admiring its celadon hull and upholstery white enough to blind a Modernist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Joel's ideas for the boat's graceful lines were drawn from Long Island lobster boats. And the idea of keeping it fast came from the large commuter yachts that industrialists like J. P. Morgan used to speed from Great Neck to Wall Street in less than an hour. Mr. Joel, who has no training in design, began by sketching on the proverbial cocktail napkin, in consultation with Mr. Needham. A naval architect translated their ideas for a lightweight, fast boat into detailed blueprints.</p>
        <p>Mr. Joel owns the patent on the hull design, and collects a royalty on every runabout that Mr. Needham builds -- about seven a year -- at his Coecles Harbor Marina on Shelter Island. The first boat was christened in 1996. Now, the yard employs 14 carpenters and electricians. At midcentury, Long Island was home to dozens of mom and pop boat builders, but Mr. Joel can name only four other companies now in business. So he takes great pride in having revived boat building on the East End.</p>
        <p>The same people who buy mansions buy boats. Recently, a buyer  ordered a 50-foot version at $1.5 million. But most buyers are satisfied with the regular model, which can hit 48 knots (about 55 miles per hour). That's perfect for the mogul who wants to crack lobsters in Newport, followed by a swim off Block Island before heading back to East Hampton for the evening. At a mile a gallon of gasoline at top speed, the twin 415 horsepower MerCruiser motors would make an SUV owner feel saintly. With Mr. Joel offering his hand, Ms. Bergin stepped gamely aboard Mr. Needham's runabout in clunky, heeled sandals, ready to cruise.</p>
        <p>''I neglected to bring my boating shoes,'' she said, with a pronounced Long Island accent. With her puffy lips and sparkling eyes, Ms. Bergin appears to possess the same television-friendly genes as Deborah Norville. Mr. Joel, with his T-shirt, chinos and sun-baked cragginess, looks more like the guy who would clean the fish for you once you got back dockside. Still, they make a good pair.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Joel took the helm, Ms. Bergin said, ''I'm a good mate, aren't I, Billy?'' He laughed and set the boat in motion.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bergin and Mr. Joel met five years ago when she interviewed him for a news program. She's a South Shore girl and he's a North Shore boy -- a few miles inland in Levittown, to be precise -- and they got along well. But they didn't start dating until a few months ago.</p>
        <p>''I got married first, and then I got divorced,'' Ms. Bergin said.</p>
        <p>That's when Christie Brinkley, Mr. Joel's wife until 1994 and a friend of Ms. Bergin, called Mr. Joel to say, ''Did you notice that Trish isn't wearing a wedding ring anymore?'' Mr. Joel asked Ms. Bergin out.</p>
        <p>Now, the two spend much of their free time out on the water, trying, often unsuccessfully, to escape notice. ''People come out of nowhere,'' Mr. Joel said. Pointing across the harbor to the house of the photographer Patrick Demarchelier, he added, ''One day that guy came screaming up to us in his boat saying, 'Billeee, tout le bla bla bla.' I couldn't understand a word.'' His challenge one recent day was slipping past the crowds at the waterfront East Hampton Point restaurant. With its teak details and classic look, Mr. Joel's runabout is so distinctive that it's not the boat for shrinking violets.</p>
        <p>''Even sailboaters who look down their noses at all powerboats wave to this one,'' Mr. Joel said, as the restaurant came into view. Two other Shelter Island Runabouts were tied up near the restaurant, looking distinguished and serene in the ostentatious flotilla of fiberglass and  chrome.</p>
        <p>During lunch, a couple more  passed in the harbor. Mr. Needham remembers the details of each one. He becomes so attached to the boats while building them, he said, that he cried the first time he had to ship one off to a Microsoft millionaire.</p>
        <p>''I knew I'd never see it again,'' he said. Most buyers add custom woodwork, upholstery, tuna towers and other extras that easily raise the price to $10,000 a linear foot.</p>
        <p>Although the excess of tropical hardwoods makes the galley and cabin feel luxurious, the space holds little more than a microwave, a refrigerator and a sink, with room in the bow for two to sleep in a pinch. (Mr. Joel designed the head twice as large for comfort.) Some owners hire interior designers to tweak the teak, but the clean design doesn't take well to froufrou.</p>
        <p>''Over the years, I've developed a pretty good idea of what a boat should look like,'' Mr. Joel said. ''And it shouldn't look like you started with the screening room and designed out from that. It's also easy to overyacht a boat with too much nautical stuff. I see those curtains printed with anchors, and every light fixture designed like an old boat lamp, and I want to say, 'Hey, I get the point -- we're on the water!' ''</p>
        <p>While Shelter Island Runabout owners will probably never drag a bleeding swordfish up over the transom, Mr. Joel likes that utilitarian illusion. It's all part of his workingman fantasies. For years, he's been identified as a friend to bay men on the East End. He's fought, unsuccessfully by and large, to preserve their fishing lifestyle, and he's done countless benefits for local causes. But the reality is that nostalgic millionaires are snapping up Mr. Joel's surrealistic versions of the old fishing boats just as the bay men are disappearing into history.</p>
        <p>This partly explains why Mr. Joel recently sold his East Hampton estate, complete with a collection of boats on the lawn, to Jerry Seinfeld, after more than a decade of living year-round on the South Fork.</p>
        <p>''Jerry asked me, did I want to sell the place,'' Mr. Joel said. ''I threw out a number and he said O.K. So I asked my daughter, 'Should I sell this house?' And she said, 'Daddy, change is good.' ''</p>
        <p>And she wasn't talking small change -- $34 million. Mr. Joel is looking for a waterfront place on the North Shore. ''As celebrity spotting became a sport, it became hard for me to leave my driveway on weekends,'' he said. A commotion in the restaurant caused him to look up. ''Hey, there's Alexa,'' he said of his teenage daughter, his face brightening. Alexa and her mother's blond mane came into view across the room. Cameras flashed as Mr. Joel reminded Alexa to remember her passport for an upcoming trip. Two  women nearby suddenly felt the need to videotape. Ms. Bergin asked Ms.  Brinkley about her new yacht, a cute but respectable work boat she recently bought, which clearly shows Mr. Joel's influence. Alexa then took her mother off to the powder room for a makeup session.</p>
        <p>A waitress appeared at Mr. Joel's side, looking nervous. ''I know people must say this to you all the time,'' she said. ''But your music has been the soundtrack to my entire life. And I hope you'll keep making more of it so I can have something to get married to, to have my babies to.''</p>
        <p>''I will,'' Mr. Joel said kindly. ''Although I don't know if you'll like it. I'm composing classical music now.''</p>
        <p>The waitress looked puzzled. She hadn't heard about this sea change.</p>
        <p>In the distance, the Islander putted out of the harbor, heading for Connecticut, where Mr. Joel rents it out.  Mr. Needham piloted the runabout to a pier, where Mr. Joel and Ms. Bergin's car waited. Then, Mr. Needham headed back toward Shelter Island,  throttle wide open, waving to yachtsmen all the way. It was a Sunday, and his crew was working overtime. Another millionaire was expecting his new boat on Thursday, and the bow wasn't quite ready for a Veuve Clicquot christening.</p>
