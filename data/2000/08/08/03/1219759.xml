        <p>Just six years ago, when George W. Bush ran for governor of Texas, even his parents expected him to lose.</p>
        <p>It was his younger brother Jeb who held the family's confidence and aspirations, who had diligently prepared for his bid to become governor of Florida in 1994. George W., in contrast, had come to his ambitions haphazardly, and his mother, Barbara, flatly tried to discourage his seemingly quixotic resolve. Friends and family members say that the elder Bushes worried that George W. would be forced to bow again, as he had several times before, to failure.</p>
        <p>But that story had a surprise ending: while Jeb lost, George won. And in the process, George Walker Bush, now 54, launched himself, without any grand plan or intricate forethought, on a trajectory that on Thursday will place him in the spotlight as the Republican nominee for president, continuing along what historians may recall as a most remarkable path to the White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is almost an accidental candidate, a cocky and cheerful fellow who drifted through much of his life and who was largely unknown in the United States until he assumed his first political office five and a half years ago. Yet he now leads the polls and will have, if elected, one of the thinnest resumes in public service of any president in the last century.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's exceptional trajectory also means that he remains a riddle wrapped in layers of paradox. It would be too much to describe him as the Republican Party's blind date, but there still is a great deal about his beliefs and leadership style -- about the kind of president he would be -- that remains unknown.</p>
        <p>He is a man who sometimes tortures the English language, puzzling audiences with references to the ''vile'' hemisphere (instead of ''vital'') and tailpipe ''admissions'' (''emissions''), and mystifying a group of New Hampshire schoolchildren during Perseverance Month when he earnestly counseled them, ''You've got to preserve,'' as if they should all rush out to can tomatoes.</p>
        <p>Yet he has a dazzling charm, tremendous social skills, a bold self-confidence, growing political savvy, great popularity among the Texans who know him best -- and a past littered with opponents who underestimated him. Those who have worked with Mr. Bush, Democrats as well as Republicans, mostly say that contrary to all the jokes, he is smart, shrewd and a quick study.</p>
        <p>The paradoxes go on. He is the law-and-order candidate, the amiable governor who presides over a stream of executions, the preacher of traditional moral values, the mover behind a convention that called for giving young people the ''moral strength'' to resist drugs. And yet he was arrested twice in college for pranks, and he avoided military service in Vietnam, abused alcohol and dances around questions in ways that suggest that he used illegal drugs himself.</p>
        <p>He steers a conservative path. And yet he can startle all-white Republican audiences full of women in pearls with sympathetic remarks about Mexican immigrants.</p>
        <p>He is the ultimate outsider candidate, dripping with scorn about the ways of Washington and disdainful of Ivy League institutions, always deeply proud of his frontier roots in the rattlesnake country of Midland, Tex. And he is the ultimate insider candidate, a Yale and Harvard graduate whose Rolodex brims with the names of corporate and political titans, and blue-blooded enough that even as a little boy he realized on a visit to his relatives that his best friend should not have drunk from the finger bowls.</p>
        <p>Like most Republicans, he rejects quotas used for affirmative action as unfair. Yet he never complained about the fairness of preferences that in the 1950's helped boys like him get into high schools like Andover or colleges like Yale, because their fathers had gone there before. Judging from his high school grades and college board scores, he almost certainly would not have been accepted at Yale without his family ties.</p>
        <p>Better than virtually any other politician, Mr. Bush reflects Kipling's ideal -- ''If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings -- nor lose the common touch.'' He has hobnobbed with Queen Elizabeth and is equally at ease with beer-bellied baseball fans; he would be a gold medalist in small talk if it were an Olympic sport. Yet he is the scion of one of America's most prominent political families.</p>
        <p>(The word ''dynasty'' is taboo around the Bushes, sometimes turning Mr. Bush's charm congealing into something close to icy fury. But Mr. Bush is a direct descendant of President Franklin Pierce on his mother's side and of a more recent president on his father's side.)</p>
        <p>He is casual and unpretentious, sometimes goofy. Before mealtime recently on his campaign plane, the flight attendant handed him a piping-hot towel, and he did what passengers typically do, rubbing his fingers and mouth. But then he draped the towel over his face and leaned toward the person next to him as if playing peek-a-boo.</p>
        <p>Where, oh where, was the Republican presidential candidate? Hiding under a  square of terry cloth, as he pursued an office that embodies gravitas and dignity.</p>
        <p>Always quick to lampoon bigwigs, Mr. Bush used to entertain friends with splendidly cruel impressions of some of his father's more haughty cabinet members. And now this man who delights in deflating important people may himself become the most important person in the world.</p>
        <p>The Personal Over Politics</p>
        <p>It is too early to resolve these paradoxes with any certainty, and Mr. Bush, somebody allergic to what he dismisses as ''psychobabble,'' is not much help. But it may be possible to venture a few useful clues.</p>
        <p>One is that Mr. Bush is -- and perhaps always has been -- more of a ''people person'' than a political person. In high school  and college, he always sought to be the center of attention but showed no interest in political debate. Marlin Fitzwater, who was President Bush's spokesman, says that in the late 1980's and early 90's, when he saw the Bush children young George was amiable, but far from political.</p>
        <p>''George W. almost never showed interest in politics or policy,'' Mr. Fitzwater recalled. ''I can't remember us ever talking about policy, in fact. In those days, he was in the oil business in Midland, at first, and then involved in baseball, and so we would talk about that or we'd chat about what was in the newspaper or about sports.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzwater added, ''George W. was so apolitical in the way he approached the presidency and the family that I was shocked when he ran for governor.''</p>
        <p>That may overstate the case. Mr. Bush, who was born on July 6, 1946, has been around politics since he helped his father campaign for the Senate in 1970 (giving such good pep talks, remembers Anson Franklin, then an aide to his father, that some people even then said he was a better speaker than his father). But when he helped his father run for the Senate, or later for president, he seemed impelled more by love and loyalty than by passion about the issues. Friends say that when he himself ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1978, he was motivated not by deep-seated ideological convictions but by the thought that it would be cool to be a congressman.</p>
        <p>In adulthood, one of the best ways to be in the spotlight and get the loudest laughs for your jokes is to be successful in politics, and Mr. Bush has seemingly drifted toward that spotlight less because of political beliefs than because he enjoys it and is very good at it. But there is something more: the pressure to uphold his family legacy of public service and the expectations it created.</p>
        <p>''He admired his father tremendously and wanted to live up to the expectations that his family had for him and for all members,'' recalled Ted Livingston, a Yale roommate.</p>
        <p>This Bush legacy offers another clue to understanding him. Deep in the family aristocratic tradition there is a commitment to public service that is easy to mock as a version of the white man's burden -- a sort of Bushes' burden. One of Mr. Bush's heroes was his grandfather, Prescott Bush, an impossibly tall, impossibly severe financier who would have died rather than kiss a baby. Yet Prescott Bush subjected himself to the indignity of electioneering so as to be elected senator. He was pragmatic and nondoctrinaire in much the same way as his grandson, and he became one of the first senators to denounce Joseph McCarthy.</p>
        <p>Herbert S. Parmet, a historian and biographer of President Bush, said he believed that the younger Bush's political career arose from that family legacy honoring public service. His political flexibility, his talk of inclusiveness and his speeches about ''compassionate conservatism'' all reflect Bush family values, Professor Parmet said.</p>
        <p>''It's easy to ridicule,'' he acknowledged. ''But it comes out of the family, out of noblesse oblige and all that.''</p>
        <p>Thriving on Instinct</p>
        <p>Another clue is that in place of an ideology, Mr. Bush seems to have something milder and sketchier -- call it instinct. It is not rigid or deeply partisan, and its essence is to incline toward pro-business policies, tax cuts and limited government. In recent years, Mr. Bush has fleshed it out a bit more, relying upon right-wing thinkers and writers like Marvin Olasky and Myron Magnet, who have written books harshly criticizing 1960's liberalism and the welfare state.  In a note to Mr. Magnet, Mr. Bush praised him for having ''charged our intellectual batteries.''</p>
        <p>Still, these batteries often seem like triple A's. Mr. Bush is determinedly anti-intellectual, gives little evidence of having thought out a political philosophy, waffles on many issues and often jokes about his fondness for reading the executive summary and skipping the long report. All this means that he is not exactly a blank slate, but a relatively illegible one.</p>
        <p>The famous pop quiz that he flunked last year, about foreign leaders, may have been silly in some respects, but it perhaps got at something deeper: this is a man who is often very casual about geopolitical information, and it is another way in which he is an unusual and sometimes awkward candidate. Mr. Bush seems deeply out of sync with America's elite, dismissive of its icons and ignorant of what it regards as essential information.</p>
        <p>Left to his own devices, on his campaign plane, Mr. Bush talks more about his pets than his proposals. When heading back home to Austin after a campaign trip, he talked about his upcoming weekend.</p>
        <p>''I'll be reading policy,'' he declared with an exaggerated and mock seriousness. Then he grinned and admitted, ''No, I'll probably take a few naps.''</p>
        <p>Yet some of his advisers say that all this places him in greater touch with the American heartland.</p>
        <p>To understand the world around him, Mr. Bush reaches first not for policy papers but for his Bible. He says he reads it every day. When asked to name his favorite philosopher-thinker, he simply replied: ''Christ, because he changed my heart.'' He does not wear his faith on his sleeve, does not thump on his Bible and is reluctant to talk about his views on evolution. But Mr. Bush, who was raised Presbyterian and then joined his wife's Methodist church after his daughters were born, is clearly shaped in important ways by his religious beliefs.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush has an ideology, it is personal, not political; it is simply loyalty. It is a deep loyalty to his father and to friends who have stood by him and his family. Many of his top aides have been friends for many years or decades, and loyalty was again a subtext when Mr. Bush chose as his running mate Dick Cheney, the defense secretary under President Bush. The Texas governor was not merely going to restore honor and integrity to the White House, as he pledged in many a stump speech. He was going to reunite the personnel.</p>
        <p>An Ever-Evolving Style</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush often seems an echo of Prince Hal, the likable but dissolute son of King Henry IV in Shakespeare's histories. Hal sobers up when he inherits the crown as Henry V -- and ultimately becomes a model leader who is a better ruler for his past wildness. One of the most interesting questions about Mr. Bush is whether he will grow in the same way.</p>
        <p>Certainly there are signs that he has matured. For much of his life, his awesome people skills were undermined by his volatile temper, his sharp tongue, his tendency to hold grudges. But when he ran for governor in 1994, his opponent, Ann Richards, thought it would be easy to goad him into losing his cool and humiliating himself; instead he surprised friends and rivals alike with his steadiness under pressure and a newfound discipline.</p>
        <p>That discipline and self-restraint have been evident in a taut campaign this year, in which Mr. Bush kept his temper in check and relentlessly stayed ''on message.'' After a divisive primary season, he managed better than many had expected to unite the Republican Party and get what he wanted in this convention.</p>
        <p>Central to this political success is his campaign style. Mr. Bush's years as a farmer of wild oats left him with a down-to-earth manner that resonates with voters in a way his father's and grandfather's styles never quite did.</p>
        <p>''I never thought of myself as a bad campaigner,'' President Bush mused in a recent interview. ''After all, I was elected president of the United States. And I like people and all. But I think George is better.''</p>
        <p>Friends of the family second that. Indeed, the very things that critics often denounce in George W., such as his anti-intellectualism and uninterest in policy details, come across to many voters as an unpretentiousness and fundamental likability that are his greatest political strengths.</p>
        <p>One aspect of Mr. Bush's personality that irritates his critics and endears him to his supporters is that he seems to have a mere human-sized ambition. One sometimes gets the sense that Vice President Al Gore wanted to be president from second grade; little Georgie wanted to be a major league baseball player.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has always put a priority on having a good time. Of his schoolbook Latin, the phrase that he summons from memory is, characteristically: ''ubi ubi sub ubi.'' It is a sophomoric pun, which he translates as: ''Where, oh where, is your underwear?''</p>
        <p>Even now, Mr. Bush balances his ambition with his desire for comfort. It is important to him; he carries his own feather pillow on the road, goes out of his way to vow that the couches will be ''comfortable'' in the house he is building on his Texas ranch.</p>
        <p>''During the Democrat convention, it's traditional for a candidate to go out of the news, which I plan to do,'' Mr. Bush mused recently. ''We started thinking about a lot of places to go. I said, 'I want to go to my own place, my own bed, my own house, my own dog.' So that's what I'm going to do.''</p>
        <p>Of course, for most of his life Mr. Bush  had little reason to be pretentious. Until the late 1980's, he was simply a struggling oilman in Texas, albeit the son of the vice president, and his career took off mostly after he became a part-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team in 1989, and then was elected governor of Texas in 1994.</p>
        <p>His name and connections helped him, and without them it is difficult to imagine that he would be a candidate today (a proposition that Mr. Bush does not really argue with, although he hates to talk about it).</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's underdog victory as governor did not seem to be a harbinger at first; ''Bush'' was then a four-letter word in many Republican circles, a reminder of a president who had broken his no-new-taxes pledge and surrendered the White House to those exasperating Clintons.</p>
        <p>But then Governor Bush was re-elected in 1998 with an astonishing 69 percent of the vote, and his fortunes soared. He became the great Republican hope, the money poured in, and he was crowned as the presidential front-runner.</p>
        <p>There was a bumpy stretch in the primaries after Senator John McCain won in New Hampshire, but within six weeks Mr. Bush had recovered. He has been almost constantly ahead of Al Gore ever since.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it is this front-runner status, or more likely a trait ingrained since childhood, but Mr. Bush campaigns as an utter stranger to self-doubt. He seems certain that he will win. One result is that he reaches out to formidable policy advisers; he does not seem to worry that he will look ignorant in comparison -- or, more searchingly, that he should, like them, devote himself more energetically to understanding the world.</p>
        <p>This self-confidence can also breed trouble. He is so sure of himself, his own good intentions and the prospect that people will see him as he wants to be seen, that he is often perceived as arrogant. His confidence can also lead him to stumble.</p>
        <p>When he spoke at Bob Jones University in the primary season, despite its founder's record of anti-Catholic comments and the school's reputation for racism, he seemed unprepared for the fallout and taken aback by it. He assumes that he should be judged inclusive for his willingness to speak to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, rather than exclusive and insensitive for his speech at Bob Jones.</p>
        <p>Likewise, he seemed surprised that people would see his pick of Mr. Cheney, a rich, white relic of his father's administration, as contradicting his portrayal of himself as a fresh voice, an outsider, an agent of a new inclusiveness in the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's self-confidence leaves him one of the least neurotic people on the planet, and also one of the least inclined to examine himself. He glides along, glibly and optimistically, confident that his innate cleverness will make up for whatever else he lacks, deliberately ignoring the slings and arrows of his outrageous good fortune.</p>
        <p>''I don't read half of what you write,'' he told the press corps on his campaign plane last month, in a bit of pregnant banter suffused with equal parts defiance and mischievous charm.</p>
        <p>''We don't listen to half of what you say,'' one of the reporters shot back.</p>
        <p>''That's apparent,'' Mr. Bush replied, never missing a beat, ''in the other half of what I read.''</p>
