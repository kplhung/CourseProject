        <p>THE ghost of Looking Glass Studios hovers about me as I explore Deus Ex. The specter of that celebrated game developer, which closed its doors in May, whispers in my ear as the story folds conspiracy upon conspiracy. It cackles softly as I fumble for equipment to master the game's electronic locks and struggle to recall passwords. It curls about my ankles like an unseen cat as I stand in darkness and debate my next direction. I have many choices and, in most of them, the ghost follows close upon my heels.</p>
        <p>Looking Glass did not participate in the design of Deus Ex, an action and role-playing game that was developed by Ion Storm in Austin, Tex. But the producer of Deus Ex, Warren Spector, worked on Looking Glass's two Ultima Underworld games, System Shock and Thief, and he appears to have brought to this new game the restless spirit and the delightful sense of freedom associated with that studio's best work.</p>
        <p>The appearance of Deus Ex within weeks of Looking Glass's shutting down had the feel of an epitaph. But it is a grand, poignant epitaph that pays a compliment both to the Looking Glass legacy and to the skill of Mr. Spector and his team.</p>
        <p>Computer and video games tend to slide into the nearest convenient hole. Although the details vary, you can reasonably predict that a role-playing game will be driven by relentless combat. An adventure game will unfold a story in puzzles. An action game will send you out to kill.</p>
        <p>Looking Glass games were different. Beginning with the Ultima Underworld games in the early 1990's, Looking Glass consistently expanded the boundaries of the genres in which it worked. Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri was one of the first 3-D games to offer squad-based combat. Even when Looking Glass spread its wings and delved into unfamiliar genres -- flight simulation, with the Flight Unlimited series, and sports, with British Open Championship Golf -- it did so with panache. The flight simulators were written for passengers as much as for pilots and the golf game had wonderful crowds.</p>
        <p>But Looking Glass found its true calling in its 3-D action-adventure games. Games like System Shock, Thief: The Dark Project and their recent sequels belonged to no single genre. They were action, role-playing and adventure games living under one roof, mingled so closely that you could not easily tell where one genre left off and the next began.</p>
        <p>The result was the purest, freest kind of play, unhindered by categories, rules or expectations and, finally, not even by the machine on which it operated. (Looking Glass Games always seemed to hover in the ether between the player and the screen.) The typical measures of role-playing games -- the experience points and character statistics -- became irrelevant as you effectively became the on-screen character. Just as the genres melted into one another, the player melted into the game.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to Deus Ex. Set in a plague-ravaged world, the game casts you as a technologically augmented agent named J. C. Denton, who is working for a United Nations anti-terrorist unit. The story laid out for him at the end of the first of 15 missions sounds like a paranoid's nightmare. (The government started the plague for population control. The Trilateral Commission is behind a secret government. I am just waiting for a reference to black helicopters.) The paranoia gains in strength and resonance as the game progresses. Soon enough, you will not know what to believe.</p>
        <p>Like its Looking Glass antecedents, Deus Ex presents the player with a wide range of fascinating and well-distributed tasks. It is pleasantly, albeit sinisterly, full of alternate approaches, things to do and things to find and use. It never does the same thing for too long and thus never allows you to grow weary with a single conceit.</p>
        <p>There are newspapers to be read, locked doors to be unlocked, characters to be questioned (and re-questioned). There are people to shoot, and people to avoid. There are enhancements to bestow upon your character. There are experiments to perform with exotic inventory items. There are computers to be hacked. There are out-of-the-way places to be explored (with attached experience-point bonuses).</p>
        <p>The twist in Deus Ex is the psychological state of the player. In the Looking Glass games, your actions were always imbued with purpose, but in Deus Ex, they come to be imbued with doubt. After an initial  aggressive foray up a headless and torchless Statue of Liberty, I found  myself growing steadily more tentative, shocking enemies into unconsciousness instead of shooting them, asking questions first and paying more attention to who I wanted my character to be than to what he could do. Almost without knowing it, I had slipped into his skin.</p>
        <p>These are a few of my favorite things. It is not the end of the list, and I am not even sure that I can make a list. I can't begin to remember all the loose ends I want to follow up -- missions are still tugging at my cuffs, begging to be replayed in different fashion -- and I have no doubt that there are other, looser ends I will discover if I look long enough and hard enough.</p>
        <p>Deus Ex is not quite perfect. It lacks some of the sense of balance and grace of the Looking Glass games, and since it is spread over disparate levels around the world, it lacks some of the wholeness of being sited in a single ominous place. But its open structure and varied play should serve to encourage movement toward games that are less defined by genre and more by immersiveness and fun. At the very least, it should help foster a fertile climate for coming transgenre efforts like Loose Cannon, an action-driving game; Giants: Citizen Kabuto, an action-strategy game; and  Oni, an action-fighting game. Then again, playing mix-and-match with genres can be risky. In 1997 and 1998, two action-strategy hybrids, Uprising and Battlezone, garnered much critical acclaim but failed to capture the public imagination.</p>
        <p>If Deus Ex is a hit, Looking Glass will not be around to celebrate. But its reflection lingers.</p>
        <p>Deus Ex, developed by Ion Storm; published by Eidos Interactive for Windows 95 and 98, $39.95; published by Aspyr for Macintosh 8.1 and later, $49.95; for players 17 and older.</p>
