        <p>The number of birds and mosquitoes testing positive for West Nile virus in New York State is accelerating rapidly, state health officials reported yesterday, in a finding that is inspiring yet more rounds of pesticide spraying in New York City, Suffolk County and other areas.</p>
        <p>As of the end of July, the state had confirmed 67 infected birds and 25 samples of mosquitoes that were carrying the virus. But in just the last two days, those totals jumped to 115 birds and 38 samples of mosquitoes, state officials said.</p>

        <p>The number of birds and mosquitoes testing positive for West Nile virus in New York State is accelerating rapidly, state health officials reported yesterday, in a finding that is inspiring yet more rounds of pesticide spraying in New York City, Suffolk County and other areas.</p>
        <p>As of the end of July, the state had confirmed 67 infected birds and 25 samples of mosquitoes that were carrying the virus. But in just the last two days, those totals jumped to 115 birds and 38 samples of mosquitoes, state officials said.</p>
        <p>No human cases of the mosquito-borne virus have been reported so far this year. Last year, 7 people in the New York region died and 55 became seriously ill from West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, the virus had been confirmed in 15 birds as of July 31, and in Connecticut, it was confirmed in one bird in Stamford on Monday, as in mosquitoes there earlier. And in Massachusetts, officials last week reported their first infected bird.</p>
        <p>Within New York State, the reach of the virus has also grown in the last week, with a report for the first time this year that infected birds had been found far from New York City, in Ulster County and in the village of Liverpool, near Syracuse.</p>
        <p>The most intense evidence of the virus continues to surface in the New York City area, especially on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that health officials had confirmed 15 additional infected birds, 2 in Manhattan and 13 on Staten Island. This means that as of yesterday, the total number of infected birds found this year in New York City had doubled to 32.</p>
        <p>The mayor announced that for the first time the city would extend its pesticide campaign to the southwest Bronx and most of Manhattan north of 110th Street, after an infected dead crow was found near Trinity Cemetery at Broadway and 155th Street. The second infected bird found in Manhattan was picked up in the southern section of Central Park.</p>
        <p>Given the finding of the infected bird in Central Park and growing signs of resurgent mosquito populations there and in Alley Pond Park in Bayside, Queens, Mr. Giuliani also announced that the city would respray the two parks, both of which were treated with pesticides late last month.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan, Bronx and Queens sprayings are set for tomorrow night and before dawn on Saturday. Central Park will be closed to the public shortly after midnight tomorrow, officials said. All of Staten Island was scheduled to be sprayed last night.</p>
        <p>Dr. Neal L. Cohen said that city officials were working intensely to try to ensure that any human cases of the virus were identified. To date, the city has ruled out 160 possible cases while it awaits test results from some 40 people with West Nile-like symptoms.</p>
        <p>''We are very, very actively looking,'' Dr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>West Nile-related pesticide spraying has also taken place, or is scheduled, in Liverpool and in Suffolk County. Officials in Suffolk reported yesterday that the virus had been confirmed in 13 samples of infected mosquitoes collected on July 17 and in 12 additional birds.</p>
        <p>The infected mosquitoes in Suffolk appear to be concentrated in Belmont Lake State Park in Babylon, which was sprayed with pesticides the day after the infected mosquitoes were collected.</p>
        <p>John R. Bianchi, a spokesman for the National Audubon Society, said he thought pesticide spraying had been excessive. The spraying might present a risk to humans and wildlife, he said. City officials have offered assurances that the treatments are safe.</p>
