        <p>The independent counsel investigating President Clinton has impaneled a new grand jury to hear evidence about Mr. Clinton's relationship with a White House intern, two and a half years after it was first disclosed.</p>
        <p>The independent counsel, Robert W. Ray, convened the panel last month to consider whether Mr. Clinton should be charged with perjury or obstruction of justice after he leaves office in January, the officials said.</p>
        <p>At issue is whether Mr. Clinton lied when he denied under oath having a sexual relationship with Monica  Lewinsky. The officials said there was no indication that the grand jury would be hearing any fresh evidence.</p>
        <p>The White House reacted angrily to the grand jury disclosure, which came just hours before Vice President Al Gore was to accept the Democratic Party's nomination for president.</p>
        <p>''The timing of this leak reeks to high heaven,'' Jake Siewert, a White House spokesman, said.</p>
