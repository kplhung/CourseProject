        <p>With growing evidence of catastrophic damage to the hull of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, Russian officials said today that ''irrefutable data'' pointed to a collision. They said the object or ship that collided with the Kursk has not been identified yet.</p>
        <p>Any vessel that could cause the sort of damage described by the Russian officials would itself have suffered enormous damage, and no such vessel has been reported.</p>
        <p>One school of speculation is that the Kursk collided with a Russian cargo ship. Adm. Eduard Baltin, a senior commander of submarine forces in the Pacific under the Soviet Union, said today in an interview that the Kursk was operating in a sea lane frequently used by cargo vessel traffic. ''I think the only realistic version is that the sub collided with a cargo vessel because it is in an area where there is a recommended course for civil navigation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>American military and intelligence officials have been dubious that a collision occurred. They say that American submarines that were reportedly monitoring the exercises in which the Kursk was taking part were not involved in the disaster, and have reported hearing large explosions underwater, which they said were distinct from a collision.</p>
        <p>Russian rescue teams made several more unsuccessful efforts today to try to lock onto a rear escape hatch of the Kursk.</p>
        <p>Even though there have been no signs of life for two days now from the 118 sailors and officers who went down with the submarine last weekend during training exercises in the Barents Sea, navy commanders met for eight hours with Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov at Severomorsk, headquarters of the Northern Fleet, and decided to continue the rescue efforts.</p>
        <p>They said they would continue studying a plan to raise the vessel with pontoons and begin salvaging operations to recover two nuclear reactors that pose a long-term threat to the fisheries of the Arctic seas. After several days of stormy weather, sea conditions improved today.</p>
        <p>Although the Russians initially insisted that they were capable of handling the emergency, they asked for foreign help on Wednesday, and the British provided a small rescue submarine, the LR5, which is rushing to the scene.</p>
        <p>But it will not arrive until Saturday. If that is not too late, a British submarine commander, Alan Hoskins, offered greater hope today that the rescue vehicle would be able to latch onto the Kursk, having determined that the hatches on both vessels are compatible.</p>
        <p>British authorities also said today that they had learned from Russian officials that the Kursk is not lying at such a precipitous angle as they had thought. It is at a 20-degree angle, not the 60 degrees the Russians had spoken of, and that would make it easier for a British vehicle to attach itself to the sub, or an American one if it had been rushed to the scene.</p>
        <p>Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev, said the evidence pointed to a collision of the Kursk and an unknown vessel; he did not elaborate on the nature of such evidence. The Russians originally suggested that the cause of the accident was a collision -- either with another submarine or an old mine -- then said it seemed likely that a torpedo had exploded aboard the Kursk.</p>
        <p>The talk of a collision was evidently based at least in part on an underwater video that showed the Kursk's shattered bow section, cracked deck plates, shredded foredeck and battered conning tower, also known as the sail.</p>
        <p>Late tonight, Mr. Klebanov, who is heading an investigation, said at a news conference in Murmansk that it appeared that the Kursk sank after a collision with ''some external object of very large tonnage'' that delivered ''an extremely strong dynamic blow'' to the forward section of the submarine, where a ''terrible hole'' was opened, causing forward compartments to flood.</p>
        <p>The Kursk was operating at a depth of 60 feet at the time and may have been on an upward incline with its periscope extended in preparation to surface.</p>
        <p>Though Russian officials have asserted that two American submarines were operating in seas adjoining the exercise area, no allegation has been made that an American vessel was involved in the collision. The area also straddles shipping lanes for cargo vessel traffic between Murmansk and the polar port of Dikson in Siberia.</p>
        <p>In Moscow, Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov called the situation ''next to catastrophic.''</p>
        <p>The growing prospect that the crew may be beyond rescue, making the sinking of the Kursk Russia's worst peacetime naval disaster, generated a wave of recriminations through the Russian news media, much of it aimed at the military, but also at President Vladimir V. Putin, who remained on vacation at the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Mr. Putin went forward today with plans to meet with leaders of former Soviet republics on Friday, the day when navy officials were expected to acknowledge that the Kursk crew will be out of air.</p>
        <p>The Russian president has only appeared on television once since the Kursk disappeared on Saturday. On Wednesday he pronounced the situation ''critical'' and said everything was being done to save the crew. But later, after consulting with Western officials, including a 25-minute telephone conversation with President Clinton, Mr. Putin ordered the military to accept all offers of foreign assistance in the rescue operation. Many Russians now believe he waited too long.</p>
        <p>The most poignant criticism was expressed on national television by the mother of Aleksei Nekrasov, a sailor from the city of Kursk who lies trapped inside the submarine. ''We are indignant,'' she told a local official charged with arranging her transport to the far north. ''We are indignant that our children are still there, and not enough has been done to get them out of there.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile in Murmansk, where Russian naval officials had mobilized the hospital ship Svir, a sense of gloom set in.</p>
        <p>''What can I know apart from that my husband is dying there,'' a tearful Galina Beleyeva, the wife of one crew member, told reporters as she arrived in Murmansk.</p>
        <p>Irina Lyachina, the wife of the Kursk's commanding officer, Gennadi Lyachin, 45, told a Murmansk television station today that she was still holding out hope. ''I will only listen to what is said officially,'' she said, her voice trembling. ''I will not pester every day, asking what is going on. I think that when there is news, they will tell us.''</p>
        <p>Today, the Russian media questioned why the military and Mr. Putin failed to disclose to the nation that a tragedy had occurred last Saturday, when the first reports of underwater explosions rattled Western intelligence sensors in the region.</p>
        <p>''The sailors on the Kursk fell silent yesterday,'' the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda stated in large red type, ''Why has the president been silent? Why on earth did he think it was possible to keep mum for five days?''</p>
        <p>Underwater video taken over several days and analyzed at navy headquarters today confirmed major structural damage to the forward compartments, including the compartment that contains the bridge directly beneath the conning tower, where Captain Lyachin and a number of senior officers of the Northern Fleet would have been stationed during the maneuvers.</p>
        <p>Several officials referred to a large dent in the conning tower, another sign of collision.</p>
        <p>''The accident happened so quickly we can say it was like a flash,'' said a navy spokesman, Igor Dygalo.</p>
        <p>The Kursk, a 14,000-ton vessel, traveled through the shallows of the Barents Sea at a depth that several Russian naval officers regarded as dangerously shallow.</p>
        <p>The Oscar II-class attack submarine, designed during the cold war to assault American aircraft carrier battle groups and prevent NATO from being reinforced by convoys from the United States, has an overall length of 490 feet. If it stood on end in the place where it sunk, a 100-foot section of the hull would rise above the surface. And, from the bottom of the keel to the top of its conning tower and periscope masts, the submarine measures more than 100 feet.</p>
        <p>Operating submerged at such a shallow depth, a simple failure of a torpedo tube or a stuck diving plane could pull the submarine's nose down and send it crashing into the bottom, Western and Russian naval experts said.</p>
