        <p>The City University of New York has agreed to widen public access to its board meetings, doing so with the attention and gravitas often given to high-level diplomatic meetings.</p>
        <p>Under New York State law, the meetings must be open to the public. But CUNY only agreed to increase access after being sued, and finally came up with guidelines after nearly two years of on-again, off-again negotiations.</p>
        <p>The guidelines cover a variety of  details. For example, at least 60 places (sitting and standing) at each meeting must be reserved for members of the public. And if more than 67 people speak at a public hearing before CUNY's board meeting, the meeting must be moved out of its board room on East 80th Street to a larger auditorium in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In addition, no more than three meetings may be held outside Manhattan, and only one may be more than a five-minute walk from a subway station.</p>
        <p>''It is an important part of democracy to be able to watch as decisions are made,'' said Bill Crain, a City College psychology professor who was one of the two original plaintiffs in the lawsuit and one of the primary negotiators. Three more people later joined the suit.</p>
        <p>Jay Hershenson, a spokesman for CUNY, said yesterday that the university ''welcomes the public and is pleased to make the necessary accommodations.''</p>
        <p>But those who sued CUNY charged that when the board faced contentious issues like remedial education, CUNY filled its modest-size board room with staff, leaving little room for the public.</p>
        <p>''It is a very small room for the largest urban public university,'' Dr. Crain said.</p>
        <p>The green marble board room where CUNY's 17 trustees usually meet is on the ground floor of the university's headquarters at East 80th Street and East End Avenue. It holds 125 people.</p>
        <p>Much of what CUNY trustees discuss at their board meetings 10 times a year is mundane, things like contracts for building repairs and computer leases. But in 1995, the subject was budget cuts and interest was high. Dr. Crain and a former City College student, David Suker, filed a lawsuit charging that many people who wanted to attend were shut out.</p>
        <p>The settlement, approved by Justice Elliott Wilk of State Supreme Court, was made public this week. In the five years since the lawsuit was filed, CUNY has begun to televise board meetings live over its cable station, CUNY-TV.</p>
        <p>Judge Wilk also ordered CUNY to pay $125,000 in fees to the plaintiffs' current lawyers at Beldock Levine &amp; Hoffman and to a former lawyer, Mitchel Grotch.</p>
