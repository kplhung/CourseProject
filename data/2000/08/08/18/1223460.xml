        <p>When  Al Gore sat down at his laptop to  write  no pressure, but everyone said it had better be the speech of his life -- he began by raiding some of his favorite speeches past, culling some material that had been written for him and some of his own stuff, like the eulogy he wrote for his father's funeral.</p>
        <p>He threw in everything he might even conceivably want to mention -- 12,000 words in all, then let his speechwriters edit and polish.</p>
        <p>''Everything in the speech reflects what he wanted in the speech, if you know what I mean,'' said his top consultant, Carter Eskew, one of three aides who helped edit the vice president's acceptance speech.</p>
        <p>The top-down approach is not only the perfect reflection of the way Mr. Gore operates, but the mirror image of the way his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, worked on his recent acceptance speech. Mr. Bush, as is far more typical of presidential nominees, left the writing to the professionals and then fiddled with the text, asking for certain changes and adding some personal touches.</p>
        <p>That Mr. Gore would make the highly unusual decision to write his own words surprised no one who knows him well. After all, he wrote his own book, ''Earth in the Balance,'' and before running for office was a reporter for The Tennessean in Nashville, where his former editors fondly recall having to tear copy out of his hands as he kept right on reporting past deadline.</p>
        <p>As of Wednesday afternoon, he was still asking his staff for documents he might want to draw from.</p>
        <p>A few hours before the vice president was to deliver his address, an aide, Laura Quinn, joked, ''It's in draft 625.''</p>
        <p>''It won't be short,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Gore's first draft ran 12,000 words, he never intended to deliver a speech of that length, Mr. Eskew said.</p>
        <p>''The process was to gather a lot more material than he knew he could use,'' Mr. Eskew said. ''He enjoys the editing process. That helps him decide what's essential.''</p>
        <p>What was essential? He wanted to explain why he is running and what he has learned from listening to voters, and told several stories of people he had met in the last year, like a parent who lost a child at Columbine, and whispered in his ear, ''Promise me that these children will not have died in vain.''</p>
        <p>He wanted to introduce himself with some good biographical stories, telling about how his father, Senator Albert Gore, grew up poor in Possum Hollow, Tennessee and after living through the Depression ''entered public service to fight for the people, not the powerful.'' And how his mother, Pauline LaFon Gore, put herself through law school waiting tables in an all-night coffee shop. Yet he also wanted to get into policy details that he thought Americans ought to hear.</p>
        <p>''He has the attitude that if people don't like that they should still know that's what they're getting, ''said Mr. Gore's oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also felt strongly that he  wanted to use the speech to look to the future. ''He thinks people are not as interested in hearing what he did as vice president,'' Ms. Schiff said..</p>
        <p>After taking his initial, 12,000-word crack at the speech, he handed a computer disk with that first draft on it to a consultant, Robert Shrum, and a speechwriter, Eli Attie, who whittled it to 7,500 words.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore took that version with him on his recent vacation in North Carolina. He kept putting various chunks that his aides had taken out back in -- again in contrast to Mr. Bush's impulse to pare down his speech.</p>
        <p>''He wanted to include a foreign policy section,'' for example, Mr. Eskew said. ''Some of us felt that might be a place to cut, but he said it's an important part of the job and I want to talk about it. That's very much him.''</p>
        <p>When asked, recently, whether he regretted anything he had written in ''Earth in the Balance,'' a book that proposed phasing out the internal combustion engine, and has been widely parodied, he said he still regretted some sections that were edited out.</p>
        <p>As a senator, he not only wrote his own op-ed pieces, but in the early 1980's once turned up at the office of The New York Times and announced, ''I pulled an all-nighter on this one,'' and hung over an editor's shoulder as his piece on arms control was being edited.</p>
        <p>Where he did make cuts in his acceptance speech, though, was in streamlining wording that did not feel comfortable. His aides, for example, had come up with the line, ''We're for the people; they're for the powerful.'' His team wanted him to repeat the line about a half-dozen times.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'Well, that's true, but I only need to say it once,' Mr. Eskew said. In the final version, he quoted his high school headmaster: ''Sometimes, you have to be willing to spend your popularity in order to pick the hard right over the easy wrong.''</p>
        <p>He worked in one of the fun facts he loves, mentioning that ''there is more computer power in a Palm Pilot than in the spaceship that took Neil ARmstrong to the moon.''</p>
        <p>And, voicing his personal reaction to the discussion of honor that he heard at the Republican convention, he talked about his own definition of honor: ''Getting cigarettes out of the hands of kids before they get hooked is a family value...A new prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all our seniors, that's a family value.''  His second daughter, Kristin, who works as a comedy writer, contributed a play on words on why he opposes a Republican-size tax cut: ''You would get 62 cents in change, but that's not the change I'm seeking in America.''</p>
        <p>It was his youngest daughter, Sarah, who will be a senior at Harvard in the fall, who of all his family worked most closely with him on the speech, and spent much of the family vacation helping him edit and rewrite.</p>
        <p>Late Thursday afternoon, Mr. Eskew said the speech was now down to 5,700 words, about 1,800 more than Mr. Bush's.</p>
        <p>He insisted Mr. Gore did not feel pressured by expectations.</p>
        <p>''It's a speech he's been waiting to give for a long time.''</p>
