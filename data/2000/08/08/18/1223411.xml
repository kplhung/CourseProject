        <p>The sinking of a Russian nuclear submarine in the Barents Sea is not just a tragedy for the sailors trapped aboard, it is a warning of the dangers of running a nuclear navy on the cheap -- the way an impoverished Russia must do everything these days. There is disagreement between American and Russian experts over whether the accident was caused by an explosion aboard the submarine or by a collision with another ship. But either way, the underlying cause may be more fundamental. Money is so short that submarines rarely put out to sea.  They lack maintenance and the crews get little training. These problems, compounded by a longstanding disregard for safety, have caused accidents in the past and could have been contributing factors in this one.</p>

        <p>The sinking of a Russian nuclear submarine in the Barents Sea is not just a tragedy for the sailors trapped aboard, it is a warning of the dangers of running a nuclear navy on the cheap -- the way an impoverished Russia must do everything these days. There is disagreement between American and Russian experts over whether the accident was caused by an explosion aboard the submarine or by a collision with another ship. But either way, the underlying cause may be more fundamental. Money is so short that submarines rarely put out to sea.  They lack maintenance and the crews get little training. These problems, compounded by a longstanding disregard for safety, have caused accidents in the past and could have been contributing factors in this one.</p>
        <p>These problems have also obstructed rescue efforts. Until five days after the accident, the Russians were using primitive diving bells and a mini-sub with batteries that sustained it for only three hours. Their more advanced rescue sub may not have been ready for rapid deployment. The Russian government has also shown a chilling indifference to the sailors' fate. President Vladimir Putin has continued his Black Sea vacation, and offers of foreign assistance were rebuffed for days.</p>
        <p>The Russian Navy's deficiencies not only endanger its crew, they pose a risk to the local ocean environment. So far, Norwegian monitors have detected no radiation leakage from the downed submarine, the Kursk, but that could change if it breaks apart or if the reactors have not been completely shut down, as happened in a 1986 submarine accident despite official reassurances to the contrary.</p>
        <p>An even greater contamination danger comes from some 120 decommissioned submarines rusting off the coastlines near Murmansk and Vladivostok.  Most were mothballed when Russia simply ran out of money to operate them. Some of the submarines are no longer watertight and are in danger of sinking. Radioactive waste is slowly seeping into the surrounding water and air. Neighboring Norway is worried about a possible explosion from one of the reactors, which could contaminate local waters, kill fish and marine mammals and harm both nations' fishing industries.</p>
        <p>The United States and Norway are helping Russia to design and build prototype facilities for storing the spent fuel. But Russia does not have the money to continue the efforts. One way to get it would be to expand a program championed by Senator Richard Lugar and former Senator Sam Nunn that pays to dismantle Russia's nuclear arsenal but does not cover most of the decommissioned submarines.</p>
        <p>The chief responsibility is Russia's, however, and its performance so far has been troubling. Moscow has blocked American and Norwegian officials from seeing some of the sites they are trying to clean up, prosecuted a former naval officer who has written reports exposing the problem, and slowed progress with internal battles over financing and demands for taxes on donations. It may be a long time before Russia has the funds to operate and decommission its nuclear submarines safely, but it should at least refrain from compounding the risks.</p>
