        <p>A deputy no more, Vice President Al Gore made his debut as the Democratic presidential nominee tonight with a vow to work for all Americans, ''especially those who need a voice, those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up so they are never left behind.''</p>
        <p>Speaking to the Democratic National Convention that nominated him on Wednesday night and to the nation beyond, Mr. Gore said, ''I stand here tonight as my own man'' -- a clear rejoinder to the Republicans who have sought to picture him as a cut-rate version of President Clinton.

        <p>A deputy no more, Vice President Al Gore made his debut as the Democratic presidential nominee tonight with a vow to work for all Americans, ''especially those who need a voice, those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up so they are never left behind.''</p>
        <p>Speaking to the Democratic National Convention that nominated him on Wednesday night and to the nation beyond, Mr. Gore said, ''I stand here tonight as my own man'' -- a clear rejoinder to the Republicans who have sought to picture him as a cut-rate version of President Clinton. [Transcript, Page A21-22.]</p>
        <p>The vice president told a whooping crowd at the Staples Center on the fringe of downtown Los Angeles that he would give working families ''a full range of targeted tax cuts,'' including an early end to the so-called marriage penalty and a reform of the federal estate tax. But his proposals stopped well short of those made by his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>In a pointed reference to Mr. Bush's promise to cut federal income taxes by more than $1.3 trillion over 10 years, Mr. Gore said, ''I will not go along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process.''</p>
        <p>In what sounded like a subtle attempt to distance himself from Mr. Clinton, he promised, ''I will never let you down.'' And he was careful to confine his criticism of the opposition to policies rather than personalities.</p>
        <p>Trailing Mr. Bush in the polls, faced with an uphill fight in the Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic swing states that will decide the outcome, Mr. Gore seemed to be laying the groundwork for a fall campaign in which he would identify himself as the friend of the little guy and Mr. Bush as the candidate of the rich, powerful and influential.</p>
        <p>''Together let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not just the few, but all working families,'' the vice president declared.</p>
        <p>Again and again, he spoke of unspecified ''powerful forces'' and ''powerful interests,'' which he implicitly identified with the Republicans, standing in the way of working men and women. It was reminiscent of Theodore Roosevelt's denunciation of ''the malefactors of great wealth'' in 1907 and Franklin D. Roosevelt's castigation of ''economic royalists'' during the New Deal.</p>
        <p>''I'm happy that the stock market has boomed and so many businesses and new enterprises have done well,'' Mr. Gore said. ''This country is richer and stronger. But my focus is on working families -- people trying to make house payments and car payments, working overtime to save for college and do right by their kids.''</p>
        <p>The economy is in many ways Mr. Gore's greatest asset on the stump. Given its strength, he should be doing much better, by normal standards. Candidates of parties that hold the White House usually fare well when the economy is strong and the country is involved in no foreign war.</p>
        <p>But the vice president has been unable to generate the kind of electricity that follows Mr. Clinton everywhere. And Mr. Clinton's speech on Monday night did nothing to light a fire for his protege. ''All he did was, he made a good case for Clinton,'' said Gerald Rafshoon, Jimmy Carter's image-maker.</p>
        <p>Even in this most important hour of Mr. Gore's career, the shadow of Mr. Clinton fell across his path. It was disclosed in Washington that a new grand jury has been convened to consider whether the president should be indicted after leaving office for having lied under oath about his affair with a White House intern.</p>
        <p>Some weeks ago, Sam Popkin, a professor at the University of California at San Diego who is working in the Gore campaign, defined the goals of the two candidates at their respective conventions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, Professor Popkin said, needed to show some gravitas, while Mr. Gore needed to show some levitas. In other words, one needed to show he was not a lightweight, the other to lighten up.</p>
        <p>By common consent, the Republican made at least a start at the Philadelphia convention towards establishing himself as a serious political figure, capable of handling large issues. It was less clear how much the Democrat had improved on his image as a plodding, overearnest orator and campaigner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's speech had few rhetorical flourishes or unexpected policy departures and fewer flashes of humor. Speaking more quickly than usual, Mr. Gore poured out a flood of words; sometimes he sounded like a man with his car double-parked. But he gestured more than Mr. Bush had, and was altogether more animated.</p>
        <p>The speech, which lasted for 52 minutes, was a shopping list, and Mr. Gore acknowledged he may have sounded like a policy wonk. He even admitted, ''I won't always be the most exciting politician.''</p>
        <p>Still, he hit hard on key points, sometimes almost shouting to drive home his message. And the crowd cheered wildly when he promised to preserve abortion rights, to oppose school vouchers and to support affirmative action.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest cheers came when he promised that a comprehensive campaign spending reform bill would be the first he sent to Congress if he was elected. But he did not commit himself to the most stringent such measure -- the one sponsored by Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>''Go, Al, go!'' the crowd chanted, waving blue-and-white ''Gore'' signs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, continuing his string of promises, said that as president he would provide universal child health insurance by 2004, universal preschool education of a high quality by 2010 and use federal funds to put 50,000 more police officers on the streets of American cities.</p>
        <p>Some in his camp still hope for a modest post-convention ''bounce'' in opinion polls about Mr. Gore's candidacy, but their ultimate goal is to turn the race around in the debates with Mr. Bush. The Texas governor agreed today to three debates with the vice president, starting in early October, as well as two between the vice presidential nominees. But the Bush campaign made no agreement as to the debates' length or format.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was preceded to the podium by a parade of speakers, including Kweisi Mfume, a former congressman who is now president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamente of California, the first statewide Hispanic officeholder in this state this century.</p>
        <p>Then, in the modern, made-for-television style, a parade of friends of the nominee extolled his virtues. Among the speakers were David Halberstam, the journalist and author, a family friend, and Robert Delabar of Seattle, who met Mr. Gore while both were stationed at Fort Rucker, Ala., in the Army.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore served in Vietnam while Mr. Bush did not, a point Mr. Gore emphasized in his speech as he has done on the stump throughout the campaign.</p>
        <p>''I was an Army reporter in Vietnam,'' he said. ''When I was there, I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform.''</p>
        <p>Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, came on to introduce him. An amateur photographer, she called her husband ''a decisive leader with strong values'' and showed a series of shots from what she described as ''the family photo album.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore entered through the crowd, high-fiving several delegates, then ascended the stage to give Mrs. Gore, dressed in a sky-blue silk dress and coat, a robust bearhug. There was in Mr. Gore's speech, much of which he wrote himself, an echo of Mrs. Gore's past attacks on popular music that features explicit sexual content.</p>
        <p>''I believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning,'' he said. ''And as president I will stand with you for a goal we all share: to give more power back to the parents, to choose what your own children are exposed to, so you can pass on your family's basic lessons of responsibility and decency.''</p>
        <p>Among Mr. Gore's other themes was an openness to voters' views.</p>
        <p>''If I'm your president,'' he declared, ''I'm going to keep on having open meetings all over this country. I'm going to go out to you, the people, because I want to stay in touch with your hopes, with the quiet, everyday heroism of working families.''</p>
        <p>The vice president underlined that point by introducing people in the audience who, he said, had taught him about key issues when he met them during the campaign -- an Iowa woman who needed a tax cut to help pay for her daughter's college education, for example, and a Hispanic family from Texas who long for a less crowded, better-built school for their children.</p>
        <p>Echoing John F. Kennedy, who announced the start of a national journey to a New Frontier when nominated here in Los Angeles 40 years ago, Mr. Gore urged his listeners tonight to ''set out on a new journey to the best America.''</p>
        <p>He called it, in some of the most poetic language he used tonight, a journey ''on which we advance not by the turning of wheels, but by the turning of our minds, the reach of our vision and the daring grace of the human spirit.''</p>
