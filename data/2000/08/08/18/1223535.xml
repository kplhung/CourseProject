        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. *denotes a highly recommended film or series. The ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 7.</p>
        <p>Now Playing</p>
        <p>*''ALICE AND MARTIN,'' starring Julliette Binoche and Alexis Loret. Directed by Andre Techine (R, 123 minutes; in french with English subtitles). Mr. Techine's sprawling, emotional love story is the kind of movie that makes you work a little. It takes time to figure out the relationships between the characters, to say nothing of their motives and feelings. But like so many of Mr. Techine's movies, ''Alice and Martin'' repays the effort. The unlikely, complicated passion between Martin, the troubled illegitimate son of a wealty industralist, and Alice, a brittle violinist, unfolds against an equally complicated and sometimes overcrowded background of family secrets and shifting domestic alliances. Ms. Binoche and Mr. Loret are superb in the title roles (A.O. Scott)</p>
        <p>''AUTUMN IN NEW YORK,'' starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder. Directed by Joan Chen (PG-13, 105 minutes). In this embarrassing 1940's-style weepie, Mr. Gere is a super-star Manhattan chef and ''older man,'' ala Cary Grant, and Ms. Ryder the kooky, doe-eyed 22-year-old that designer who reforms him. Oh yes, she happens to be dying of a rare heart disease and has only a year to live. It isn't the actors' fault that this oil-and-water mixture of 40's studs (Ms. Ryder's character gorws more etherally beautiful the sicker she gets) and millennial sexual angst doesn't gel (Stepehn Holden).</p>
        <p>''BLESS THE CHILD,'' starring Kim Basinger, Rufus Sewell and Jimmy Smits. Directed by Chuck Russell (R, 115 minutes). A runny supernatural soap opera - the first thriller of the ''Touched by an Angel'' era - that tries for the elegant clam of ''The Sixth Sense'' but fails. It is too often overcome by its flamboyantly cheesy reflexes. Ms. Basinger is the protector aunt of a child (the gifted Holliston Coleman) whose heavenly powers make her the target of an evil cult leader (Mr. Sewell, chewing his English accent as if it were sunflower seeds). He means to kill her before Easter; you may feel the need to leave long before then. ''Bless the Child'' seems derivative of so many other movies that you're surprised it doesn't have to credit its sources the way hip-hop artists do when they sample songs. With Mr. Smits as an F.B.I. agent and Ian Holm as a priest who does a laughable steal from ''The Usual Suspects'' (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>*''BUTTERFLY,'' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano. Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes; in Spanish with English subtitles). This gentle, devastating film, based on short stories by the Spanish writer Manuel Rivas, tells the story of Moncho (Mr. Lozano), a sensitive young boy coming Spanish Civil War. The movie touches on the usual excitements and mysteries of childhood, but Moncho's relationship with his teacher, the proudly republican Don Gregorio, beautifully played by Mr. Fernan Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos and political complexity (Scott).</p>
        <p>*''CECIL B. DeMENTED,'' starring Melanie Griffith, Stephen Dorff, Ricki Lake and Patricia Hearst. Written and directed by John Waters (R, 88 minutes). Mr. Waters's newest comedy portrays the ultimate cult director (Mr. Dorff) as a punk madman, part Charles Manson, part Andy Warhol, leading a band of freaky ''cinema terrorists'' in blows against the Hollywood empire. When they kidnap a spoiled star (Ms. Griffin) and force her, Symbionese Liberation Army-style, to commit terrorist acts that bcome their movie-in-progress, she gleefully takes to her new role. The targets range from Pauly Shore to ''Patch Adams'' to ''Forrest Gump.'' Although smart and funny, the movie lacks the maniacal edge of Mr. Waters's most memorable work (Holden).</p>
        <p>*''CHICKEN RUN,'' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson adn Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (G, 86 minutes). The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Mr. Park, who also directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Mr. Lord's continuing stairical take on British modesty and balmy superiority. ''Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ''Stalag 17'' to ''Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Mr. Gibson, the voice of Rocky, the matinee-idol dlying rooster who is asked to teach the hens to fly. Finally the film shows that the hends can save themselves through the pluck of Ginger (Ms. Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal of this. It's a great eggscape from banality (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>*''CHUCK AND BUCK,'' starring Chris Weitz and Mike White. Directed by Miguel Arteta (R, 95 minutes). At the center of Mr. Arteta's funny, creepy and poignant new film is Buck, a 27-year-old man who inhabits the mental world of a preadolescent boy. As played by Mr. White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive, an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend Charlie (Mr. Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed careerist. Mr. Arteta's visual sense, Mr. White's insightful script and strong supporting performances from Mr. Weitz and his brother, Paul, as well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some time. ''Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore, magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this year (Scott).</p>
        <p>''DISNEYS 'THE KID,' '' starring Bruce Willis, Spencer Breslin, Emily Mortimer, Lily Tomlin and Jean Smart. Directed by Jon Turtletaub (PG, 101 minutes). In this cloying throwback to Disney's modest live-action comedies of old, Mr. Willis plays a smarmy image consultant humanized by his encounter with his 8-year-old self (Spencer Brelin), who arrives in Los Angeles via a toy red prop plane. By rights the movie should be dreadful, and it is thick with therapeutic cliches, but it occasionally soars to heights of not bad, thanks to strong performances from Mr. Willis, Ms. Tomlin and Ms. Smart, and to Audrey Wells's surprisingly clever script (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE,'' directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (PG-13, 79 minutes). Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, the former wife Jim Bakker, is the most American of stories, a figure of tragedy and a joke. This documentary walks us through her life, a veritable catalog of bad marriages, lost televangelist empires, squandered relationships with children and, despite it all, indomitable optimism. ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' cries out for a little more analysis of its subject. Instead, it joyfully wallows in the black-draft of her excesses. The directors are awfully quick to forgive Ms. Messner's lack of self-awareness, possibly because she has a heart as big as her hair. She was one of the first in the televangelist crowd to accept gay men because she's a survivor; it's more of a mash note than a formal documentary, and there's nothing wrong with that (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''FANTASIA/2000,'' with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and introductions by Steve martin, Bette Midler, Mr. Levine, Itzhak Perlman, James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, Quincy Jones and Penn and Teller. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The millennial version of Disney's 1940 ground-breaking fusio of animation and classical music includes seven new segments ad keeps one from the original film (the wonderful ''Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' starring Mickey Mouse). Despite the science fiction title and the Imax-size screen on which it is shown, ''Fantasia/2000'' is more backward-looking than futuristic. The two best segments are ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' a witty Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfield set to the music of Gershwin, and the finale (set to stravinksy's ''Firebird'' Suit), in which a cometlike sprite whooshes around the globe explosively creating, destroying and renewing the planet's life forms. Celebrity introductions lend the film the feel of a deluxe corporate promotion. At the Sony IMAX, Broadway at 68th Street, Manhattan (Holden).</p>
        <p>''HOLLOWMAN,'' starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue. Directed by Paul Verhoeven (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Verhoeven's sluggish new speical-effects thriller takes a tantalizing premise - the corrupting effects of invivsiblity - and drowns it in horror-movie hack work. Mr. Bacon plays an egomaniacal scientist who injects himself with a serum that disrupts his ''quantum synchroniation with the visible universe.'' You can guess the rest. He ends up pursuing his colleagues (including his ex-girlfriend, played by Ms. Shue) through a laybrinthine underground laboratory, looking, thanks to computer-generated imagery, like a plasticine anatomical model on a rampage (Scott).</p>
        <p>''LOSER,'' starring Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari and Greg Kinnear. Directed by Amy Heckerling (PG-13, 93 minutes). Admirers of Ms. Heckerling's movies - notably ''Clueless'' and ''Fast Times at Ridgmont High'' - may be disappointed by her latest effort, a romantic comedy about two college students who overcome the snobbery and cruelty of their surroundings to find true love. The script could have used a few more drafts and a less perfunctory climax, but Ms. Heckerling's characteristic wit and intelligence are still in evidence. Fine performances by Mr. Biggs as the title character, Ms. Suvari as the girl of his dreams and Mr. Kinnear as a sleazy literature professor help make ''Loser'' more enjoyable than most recent youth-targeted date movies (Scott).</p>
        <p>''NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS,'' starring Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson. Directed by Peter Segal (PG-13, 105 minutes). In this sequel, Mr. Murphy again displays enough agility to show that he deserves to be taken seriously. Parts of the film a variation on the Jekyll and Hyde story, are tremendously funny. Every single scene in which Mr. Murphy, hidden away undermillions of dollar's' worth of transformative makeup, plays all the members of the Klump faimly - all of them together in some scenes - will knock the blues right out of you. But some of the cheap laughs to which the picture stoops will give you the blues. This makes ''Nutty Professor II'' half a movie at best. The broad humor at times derails Mr. Murphy's performances, but the film provides a vehicle for him to display his read (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE PATROIT,'' starring Mel Gibson and Chris Cooper. Directred by Roland Emmerich (R, 158 minutes). A grueling Revolutionary War epic that, at more than two and a half hours, seems to take place in real time. The brutality and sentimentality are effective, though the film will leave you feeling used as you exit the theater. This sort-of prequel to Mr. Emmerich's ''Independence Day'' stars Mr. Gibson as a gentle farmer who leads the Colonies in wresting freedom from the Brits, using counterintuitive methods alarmingly similar to those of terrorism. His anguished masculinity is brandished like a musket. The film's chief asset is his relationship with the young actors playing his children; it draws on the actor's real-life feelings about his own large brood, and his work with them is stirring (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE PERFECT STORM,'' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, John C. Reilly and Diane Lane. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (PG-13, 130 minutes). Impressive but monotonously redundant special effects smother the human drama in this true story (adapted from Sebastian Junger's best-selling book) of a group of swordfishermen battling ''the strom of the century'' off Massachusetts in 1991. Mr. Clooney is the ship's glowering, enigmatic captain, and Mr. Wahlberg and Ms. Lane are the appealing lovebirds who lend the movie its stingy quotient of warmth. The early scenes, which paint a romantic portrait of the fisherman's life in Gloucester, Mass., promise a great deal, but the movie becomes water-logged once it leaves shore (Holden).</p>
        <p>''THE REPLACEMENS,'' starring Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman. Directred by Howard Deutch (PG-13, 105 minutes). This negligible jock comedy, about a group of misfit macho clowns who suit up for pro football during a players' strike, just wants to be loved: is that so wrong? This rehashed and desperate picture stars Mr. Reeves as the honorable, stoic full-in quarterback (he glides through). Mr. Hackman musters his requisite command as the honorable, stoic fill-in coach in a ward-robe from the Tom Landry Collection, mouting dialogue from ''Hoosiers'' and old United Airlines commercials. The unvaried rag-tag scab players include a pair of violent body-guard brothers (Faison Love and Michael Taliferro), a violent cop (Jon Favreau) and a violent felon on loan to the league (Michael Jace). Brooke Langton is the cheerleader who resolves not to date players and dates Mr. Reeves anyway. It's a peculiarity from union town L.A.: a film that celebrates anti-union activity (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''SAVING GRACE,'' starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson. Directed by Nigel Cole (R, 93 minutes). This innocuous piece of comic Anglophilia features the usual cast of lovable British eccentrics plopped down in a picturesque seaside spot, in this case a Cornish village. Ms. Bleythn is Grace, a widow whose husband committed suicide, leaving her $450,000 in debt and in danger of losing her lovely stone house. She and her resourceful gardener (Mr. Ferguson, who also wrote the screenplay) convert her greenhouse into a marijuana farm, and the resulting high jinks resemble a twee hybrid of ''The Full Monty'' and the lesser works of Cheech and Chong (Scott).</p>
        <p>''SCARY MOVIE,'' starring Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra and Shannon Elizabeth. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (R, 88 minutes). Mr. Wayans's latest genre-film spoof doesn't so much lampoon the ''Scream'' movies as offer the latest remake, this time as gross-out comedy. ''Scary Movie'' abounds in crude, often stale jokes involving male genitals, female pubic hair, flatulence and dismemberment. There are a few hilarious moments, and some that will provoke guilty laughter, but Mr. Wayans hasn't quite figured out how to parody movies - like the wildly popular ''Scream'' series - that already parody themselves (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''SPACE COWBOYS,'' starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and Hames Garner. Directed by Mr. Eastwood. The second half of Mr. Eastwood's new movie is a pleasant reworking of the standard trouble-in-space movie, with Mr. Eastwood himself leading a heroic team of astronauts that also inlcudes Mr. Jones, Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Garner. But the first half, which consists of the comic, tough-old-guy interplay between these four sublime actors, is a boisterous, easygoing tribute to manhood and maturity. Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Jones are in especially fine form, as are Marcia Gay Harden, playing a NASA engineer, and James Cromwell as (once again) the villainous bureaucrat who tries to deny the old-timers their shot at celestial glory (Scott).</p>
        <p>''SUNSHINE,'' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle, Rosemary Haris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180 minutes). In Mr. Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history, Mr. Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family - grandfather, father and son - who endure the corruption of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the viciousness of Fascism and the brutality of Communism. Mr. Fliennes's performances and those of Ms. Ehle and Ms. Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life) help save the film from melodramatic excess. Even though much of the story is crudely told, ''Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated and painful historical experiences (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE TAO OF STEVE,'' starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman. Directed by Jenniphr Goodman (R, 87 minutes). The ''Steve'' in the title refers to the spiritual embodiment of cool as exemplified by Steve Mcqueen, Steve McGarrett (''Hawaii Five-0'') and Steve Austin (''The Six Million dollar Man''), a goal to which the blobby and amiable Dex aspires. In this light-as-a-marshmallow romantic comedy. Dex (Mr. Logue) has lined up quotes from Heidegger, Thomas Aquinas and ''Don Giovanni'' to rationalize his aimless pleasure-seeking in this rather aimless movie. Mr. Logue's performance as a nice-guy player - his weight doesn't keep him from scoring with the ladies - makes the movie glide. Dex has a cherub's glee over what he gets away with. The movie becomes a lot less interesting when it rolls around to the inevitable quest for a steady relationship with a girl (Ms. Goodman) whose feelings were trampled in Dex's compulsive fox-hunting. ''Tao'' can't redeem the moves to its predictable end, but is protagonist has a great time getting there. (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''WHAT LIES BENEATH,'' starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (PG-13, 130 minutes). Mr. Zemecks's film takes its time in laying out the story of high-strung Claire (Ms. Pfeiffer), who is dissolving into hysteria on a regular basis. Her daughter has just gone off to college, and Claire is still recovering from the trauma of a car accident. Then her house starts showing signs of being haunted. Her husband, Norman (Mr. Ford), is a driven research scientist with a secret. This thriller is as implausibly chiling as any ''X-Files'' episode. By the last 10 minutes, your interest will have long vanished (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''THE WIND WILL CARRY US,'' sarring Behzad Dourani. Directed by Abbas Kiarostami (noted rated, 118 minutes). The latest film by this Iranian director, widely considered one of the greatest living filmmakers, is oblique, evocative and visually stunning. Mr. Kiarostami's views of hillsides, valleys and gnarled, solitary trees seem almost other-worldly in their clarity and depth, and his story, about a morose engineer who has come to remote Kurdish village on an enigmatic mission, is as simple and mysterious as a folk tale. This is one of those rare movies that completely absorb your attention - and demand your concentration - while you're watching, and that stay in your thoughts, growing richer and more powerful, for a long time afterward (Scott).</p>
        <p>''X-MEN,'' starring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin. Driected by Bryan Singer (PG-13, 105 minutes). The long-waited arrival of Marvel Comics' do-gooder mutants is mildly fun on a couple of levels: for one, the acting duel between Mr. Stewart (as the mutant telepath Professor X, the X-Men's leader) and Ian McKellen (as the mutant nemesis Magneto, who possesses the power of supermagnetism). As these two austere hams trill their vowels at each other, you get the feeling that you really are watching members of another species in action. And Mr. Jackman scores as the two-fisted, confrontational Wolverine, a mutant with superstrength, an ability to heal all wounds and metal-alloy claws that shoot out from his knuckles. He lives to fight, a boisterous tragic hero with no complications. Otherwise, the movie is an earnest affair that is clumsy when it should be light on its feet; it takes itself even more seriously than the comic book does, though its fans may be overjoyed by that devotion (Mitchell).</p>
