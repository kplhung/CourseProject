        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio has attracted an unbidden guest at some of his campaign events this week: a Democratic lackey in an impressively garish Uncle Sam costume who taunts Mr. Lazio over his failure to release copies of his income tax returns.</p>
        <p>Call it sophomoric or tacky (Lazio partisans call it much worse). Still, the jeers have helped draw attention to a question that has hung over Mr. Lazio: Why has he not yet disclosed his tax returns, particularly given the long history of politicians in New York stumbling over this issue?</p>
        <p>Almost since the day Mr. Lazio entered the Senate race in May, the Lazio campaign has pledged to make the information public. And with each passing week, his assistants say they need more time, explaining that they want to ensure that the returns are thoroughly researched so that when they are released, the campaign will not be blind-sided by anything in them. By the end of summer, the assistants promise. By Labor Day? The autumnal equinox on Sept. 22? They won't say.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have been sowing conspiracy theories of the what-is-Lazio-hiding variety, not to mention dispatching Uncle Sam to keep the issue in reporters' faces. On Wednesday, Howard Wolfson, the chief spokesman for Mr. Lazio's opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, even showed up at a Lazio event in Harlem to fan the flames.</p>
        <p>There is no evidence that Mr. Lazio is hiding anything, and no law requires candidates to release their tax returns. But it has become customary in high-profile contests for candidates to do so; many elected officials always do. President and Mrs. Clinton have released their returns since he took office in 1993, and before that, when Mr. Clinton was governor of Arkansas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio thus cannot easily brush aside the matter, leaving him fending off the same accusations of obfuscation hurled at the Clintons at times. And that diverts him from his strategy of trying to keep the spotlight on whether Mrs. Clinton is suitable for the job.</p>
        <p>''The Clinton campaign very badly needs to get him into the race,'' said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ''Lazio would happily rent a rowboat up in the Adirondacks and just paddle around until November and let it stay all about Hillary.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, reporters repeatedly asked Mr. Lazio about the returns as he campaigned in central New York. ''People are going to find this is a pretty boring subject,'' he said, declaring that he was not a wealthy man and vowing that the public and the media would have plenty of time to examine the returns. He seemed to suggest that they might be released by the end of the month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also attacked the Clinton campaign and the State Democratic Committee, which is paying for the Uncle Sam character. ''It's beneath what the public expects, I think, in a good, civilized dialogue about the issues and about government,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Since he went to Washington in 1993, Mr. Lazio has been required to file financial disclosure statements with the House, which are available to the public and provide limited details about his investments and other aspects of his finances. Mr. Lazio, whose Congressional salary in 1999 was $136,700, disclosed several securities trades on the forms but the profits were not specified; they were listed under a range that goes from zero to $15,000 each. Information in those documents about Mr. Lazio's trading in the securities of a brokerage firm, Quick &amp; Reilly, led to an ongoing inquiry by regulators into whether he profited from inside information.</p>
        <p>The returns would supply far more data, including how much, for example, his wife, Patricia, earned; how much the couple donated to charity; and other deductions they took.</p>
        <p>The wrangling over the returns could have few repercussions if Mr. Lazio releases them soon and they are unremarkable. Yet the delay has already left its mark, in that the returns seem likely to be scrutinized far more closely now than if they had been distributed in June.</p>
        <p>That is a lesson that more than a few politicians in New York have learned over the years, most notably former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro. In her last three runs for office -- for vice president in 1984 and for the United States Senate in the primaries of 1992 and 1998 -- Ms. Ferraro had to confront criticism that she was not releasing her tax returns or hindering access to this information. She lost all three races.</p>
        <p>In 1984, her delay in releasing her and her husband's returns dominated the news after Walter Mondale selected her for the Democratic national ticket.</p>
        <p>''I was ready to have a stroke, only because the media frenzy was so bad,'' Ms. Ferraro, now a consultant, said this week. ''The media was killing me. What happens is that when you don't stop that kind of stuff, and it gets out of control, you discuss nothing else. You discuss no issues, you discuss no campaign.''</p>
        <p>Fourteen years later, in her final run for office, she imposed restrictions on access to her returns, allowing reporters only three hours to view them and declining to provide copies.</p>
        <p>Over the years, fights over disclosure of tax returns have roiled other New York campaigns. After Gov. Hugh Carey, a Democrat, won a difficult re-election in 1978, assistants of his Republican opponent, Perry B. Duryea, a former Assembly speaker, conceded that Mr. Duryea's refusal to release several years of returns played a crucial role in his defeat.</p>
        <p>Such history did not impress Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party and a Lazio adviser. Mr. Long said he did not think Mr. Lazio had to release anything because the disclosure forms he filed with the House provided plenty of information about Mr. Lazio's finances.</p>
        <p>''I believe that the average New Yorker understands that here we have a person who has never worked in New York, never paid income taxes in New York, now asking for someone else's tax returns,'' Mr. Long said. ''It's clearly harassment, it's clearly a diversion to create a distraction. Just because Mrs. Clinton wants to see his tax returns, the congressman should jump through a hoop and do everything she demands?''</p>
        <p>''I don't see any purpose for it,'' Mr. Long said.</p>
