        <p>MetroStars goalkeeper Mike Ammann remained in St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa, Fla., yesterday with three fractured ribs, a punctured lung and facial bruises as the team pondered playing the rest of the Major League Soccer season without him.</p>
        <p>Ammann, hit by the hard-charging Tampa Bay Mutiny forward Mamadou Diallo on Wednesday night as he tried to smother a loose ball at the top of the penalty area, will be unable to travel for several days because of the punctured lung, a team spokesman said. Orlando Conguta, a recently hired MetroStars employee for team affairs, is staying in Tampa with him.</p>
        <p>The injury left the MetroStars fuming at Diallo and the game officials for not issuing a red card.</p>
        <p>MetroStars Coach Octavio Zambrano wondered if Diallo's status as a star is why officials did not throw him out of the game.</p>
        <p>''They, in a sense, become fans of the game,'' Zambrano said. ''They have to have the strength of character to make what really would have been a tough call.''</p>
        <p>The MetroStars, leading New England by 11 points in the Eastern Division with six games left in the regular season, must lean on Tim Howard as the team's goalkeeper for Sunday's home game against Colorado. But Howard -- who gave up all of Tampa Bay's goals in a 4-3 loss on Wednesday -- is scheduled to leave the MetroStars in early September to play for the United States Olympic team. He will be gone for at least three weeks.</p>
        <p>Zambrano said the likely goalkeeper will be the little-known Russell Payne, who has been playing for the Boston Bulldogs in the A-League.</p>
        <p>Another goalkeeper on that team, Anthony Latronica, might be promoted to back up Payne</p>
