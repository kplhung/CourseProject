        <p>A PARISIENNE and her companion walked around a red BMW C1 parked on a sidewalk near Trinity Church. He leaned in to view the speedometer, with a top marking of 120 kilometers an hour, or about 70 m.p.h., then fiddled with the windshield wiper. She stood back, regarded the curved roof and nodded approvingly.</p>
        <p>''It's the minivan of scooters,'' she declared, summing up the safe appearance of the relatively large scooter, which has a windshield, rollover bars and safety belts.</p>
        <p>The C1 represents a new niche in two-wheel vehicles at a time when scooters are hot. Sales of two-wheel motorized vehicles jumped 44 percent in Europe from 1995 to 1999, and although scooters are not tallied separately, several manufacturers said they were gaining faster than motorcycles.</p>
        <p>Scooters have a flat floor and an upright riding position; motorcycles force riders to straddle the engine. In a nutshell, riders can touch their knees together on scooters, and motorcycles are generally more powerful.</p>
        <p>Automakers have not ignored scooters' new popularity. BMW started selling the C1 in May, and Renault will introduce a line next spring. They join Peugeot Motocycle, which has made scooters for 50 years, and Honda, which builds them in Italy.</p>
        <p>Automakers don't regard scooters as competition. ''People have a car and a C1, or a big motorcycle for the road and a C1 for the city,'' says Arvid Des Horts, BMW's marketing director for the C1 in France.</p>
        <p>Scooters are popular, in part, because they can squirt through traffic. ''Urban congestion is creating a great opportunity,'' said Jacques Compagne, secretary general of the Association des Constructeurs Europeens de Motocycle, an industry group in Brussels. ''It has become a market of middle managers who want to get around.''</p>
        <p>Car drivers tend to choose scooters over motorcycles because of their automatic transmissions and lower center of gravity. ''There will always be a market of passion for the motorcycle,'' Mr. Des Horts said. ''But the scooter is loved for its efficiency.''</p>
        <p>That is why Renault wanted to get into the business. ''An important market is developing for urban mobility with light two-wheelers,'' said Francois Rouvier, chief of commercial projects for Renault Sport. Benelli S.p.a., an Italian scooter company with about 6 percent of the European market, will manufacture Renault's scooters. Renault will provide new designs, suspensions and clean-engine technology.</p>
        <p>For carmakers, two-wheelers carry their brand names to young people. In much of Europe, teenagers without licenses can ride scooters of up to 50 cubic centimeters.</p>
        <p>''We do a lot of special series for young people,'' said Isabelle Puzenat, a spokeswoman for Peugeot. ''The X-Team is in red, white and blue. The Urban Black was all matte black, for them to personalize.''</p>
        <p>While the youth market is relatively stable, more adults are getting on board. In many European countries, adults with a car driver's license can drive a 125 cc scooter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Compagne, of the industry group, said the average age of a two-wheel buyer was 40 last year, compared with 30 in 1990. European sales of 50 cc scooters were down 2.3 percent last year, Peugeot said, while sales of larger scooters were up 41 percent.</p>
        <p>Authorities in Germany, France and several other countries have agreed that the C1's safety features mean that its drivers don't need helmets. ''For women, it's especially nice to drive without a helmet,'' said Christine Bellanger, a BMW dealer.</p>
        <p>The red C1 parked near the Paris church belongs to Edouard Martin, a consultant in Paris who lives 22 miles away, in Elancourt.</p>
        <p>''The round trip in my car takes two and a half hours,'' Mr. Martin said. ''With the C1, I save an hour. I park in front of my office, which saves more time and 1,700 francs a month,'' or about $250.</p>
        <p>He said that the C1 was noisy and relatively expensive at $6,500. But he well understands the trade-offs between two and four wheels: his consulting firm helps companies manage their fleets of cars.</p>
