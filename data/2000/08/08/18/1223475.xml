        <p>A suspect in a string of violent break-ins on the Upper West Side was charged yesterday with three counts of attempted murder and 11 other felonies, the Manhattan district attorney's office said.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Van Baskerville, 32, was linked to six break-ins from July 14 to Tuesday, when he was arrested as he tried to burglarize an apartment on West 95th Street, said Gloria Montealegre, a spokeswoman for the the office.</p>
        <p>The authorities said Mr. Baskerville bludgeoned a woman with a heavy flashlight in one break-in, fractured a man's skull in another, and critically injured a man in a third. His arrest came as a relief to many worried residents of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baskerville, who has no known address, has convictions for robbery, burglary and parole violations, though he is not on parole now, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>In addition to the attempted murder charges, Mr. Baskerville faces five counts of assault and burglary and one count of attempted burglary, Ms. Montealegre said. The maximum sentence on each of the 10 most serious charges is 25 years.</p>
        <p>All six break-ins occurred in a ground-floor or basement apartment, and in most cases Mr. Baskerville entered through an open door or window in the early morning, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>In the first break-in to lead to an attempted murder charge, on July 24, Nicholas Rotz, 70, confronted Mr. Baskerville after Mr. Rotz's wife, Wanda, found him outside her bedroom door on West 93rd Street, the police said. Mr. Baskerville beat Mr. Rotz, critically injuring him, broke Mrs. Rotz's wrist, and fled with $300, they said.</p>
        <p>Four nights later, the authorities said, Madelyn Simon, 50, a businesswoman, and Dr. Leonard Simon, 63, a psychologist, were awakened by Mr. Baskerville in their apartment on West 87th Street. He beat both of them unconscious with a flashlight, but Dr. Simon revived and called 911, the police said. The attempted murder charge is for the attack on Ms. Simon.</p>
        <p>In the most recent break-in involving a charge of attempted murder, the authorities said, Mr. Baskerville fractured the skull of Jack Kravitz, 57, in his apartment on West 81st Street on Aug. 10. Mr. Kravitz's wife found him unconscious on the second floor of their apartment.</p>
