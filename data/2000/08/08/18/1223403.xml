        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate candidate, toured two high-tech businesses today to underscore what he said were bright spots in the upstate economy and to counter what he said were Hillary Rodham Clinton's portrayals of the region as an ''economic wasteland.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, on the second day of a bus tour across the state, watched machinery spool cable wire at a plant in Cortland and then donned a white protective coat and blue ducks as he inspected components for motion sensors at a company in Ithaca.</p>
        <p>Afterward, he called the companies examples of an economic rebound and models of the future in a region that he said had got a negative reputation. Although upstate has lagged the rest of the state in job growth, it is now catching up, he said.</p>
        <p>''We don't think we are in an economic wasteland, like the other side likes us to believe,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>To keep things moving, Mr. Lazio said, he would work for tax relief for businesses, including cutting the capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to 15 percent, and encourage technology businesses to move upstate, perhaps linking with local colleges and universities, as the Kionix Technology Company in Ithaca did with nearby Cornell University.</p>
        <p>The state's chief economist, Stephen Kagann, reported last month that private-sector employment increased and unemployment rates fell over the last year, both downstate and upstate. Private employment in June rose 2.3 percent over June 1999, with a 2.5 percent increase in New York City and its suburbs and 1.8 percent upstate. The national growth rate was 2.2 percent.</p>
        <p>Independent analysts, however, have said that much of the growth occurred in low-paying retail jobs. The statewide unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent in June from 5.3 percent a year earlier but still remained higher than the national average of 4 percent.</p>
        <p>Both candidates view the upstate region as a pivotal trough of votes and have mounted remarkably similar swings through the area. Just last month, Mrs. Clinton, too, visited electronics and technology companies, advocating those sectors as potential areas of growth and promising tax breaks and other incentives. Her aides said she has never called the region a wasteland but, like Mr. Lazio, has talked of young people leaving the area for higher-paying jobs and the need to explore other areas like technology to stimulate growth.</p>
        <p>''Apparently, Hillary is the only candidate in this race who knows upstate needs more jobs and has a plan to create them,' said Cathie Levine, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, referring to a plan the first lady unveiled in February.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Lazio sought to keep his day focused on the economy, he was distracted by the tactics of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, which has a young worker following the congressman with a video camera for prospective advertising footage, and the Democratic Party, which has sent a young man dressed as Uncle Sam pursuing Mr. Lazio and demanding he release his income tax returns. Mr. Lazio, for the third straight day, said he would release the returns this month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides, after nearly three months of tolerating the young man's videotaping, turned angry today and began holding signs in front of the man's camera. One aide stuck his face right up against the lens, with a hard stare.</p>
        <p>At a stop in Owego, Mr. Lazio ended his remarks to a gathering of party loyalists by introducing the young man who was taping him. ''So let's all say hello to Hillary Clinton and the whole Clinton camp,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''We don't have to resort to that stuff, do we?'' A chorus of no's then rose up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio had arrived in Owego somewhat self-consciously since his staff had misspelled it in a news advisory as Oswego -- which is on  Lake Ontario about 300 miles away. The gaffe was noted by local newspapers today. The campaigns have seized on each other's geographical blunders as evidence of a lack of familiarity with the state.</p>
