        <p>Americans spend $23 billion a year on pets, according to BrandWeek, a trade magazine.

        <p>IT? Stay? No, America's dogs are taking to the highway, and a few canine-conscious automakers are giving them their own travel gear.</p>
        <p>Americans spend $23 billion a year on pets, according to BrandWeek, a trade magazine. That number, which is expected to triple within five years, has not been lost on automakers, who hope to lure dog lovers with an array of products that might seem far removed from the nuts and bolts of the car business.</p>
        <p>Saab led the way in 1999, after it found that 60 percent of its customers traveled frequently with their dogs. So it came up with a line of accessories called Saab Pet Gear. The items include belts and leashes ($19.95 to $49) designed to protect dogs during accidents, playing off the company's reputation for safety engineering. Other items include cargo space guards and dividers ($145 to $155), orthopedic mats ($69.95 for the 9-5 wagon), dog or cat first-aid kits ($27.95) and food dishes ($21.50). For $19.95, Saab offers a book listing hotels and motels that accept pets.</p>
        <p>Saab is donating 10 percent of the cost of the special gear to the Humane Society of the United States.</p>
        <p>Other carmakers also aiming at what BrandWeek calls ''petophiles'':</p>
        <p>* Ford offers Focus buyers ''Have Spot Will Travel'' kits for $189 that include a sleeping mat that can be heated or cooled with water. There are also dishes, harnesses, an electronic air purifier and a lint and hair remover that fits in a cup holder.</p>
        <p>* Mercedes sells doggy-proof rear seat covers for most models (about $50) and cargo guards and dividers ($250 to $590) for its M-Class sport utility vehicle.</p>
        <p>* Subaru station wagons can be had with specially fitted cargo guards ($160).</p>
        <p>With all this paraphernalia, what dog worth his spots wouldn't want to take his human for a drive?</p>
