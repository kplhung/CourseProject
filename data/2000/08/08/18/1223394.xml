        <p>The United States Olympic swimming trials ended Wednesday night, only a month before the 2000 Summer Games begin in Sydney, Australia. It was a scheduling decision that was both calculated and risky.</p>
        <p>The last time the Americans held their trials so close to the Games was also the last time the Summer Olympics were held across the international date line -- 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. Except for Janet Evans and Matt Biondi, the Americans put on a tepid performance in Seoul, and for only the second time in the history of the modern Games did not win the swimming medal race.</p>
        <p>By comparison, the Americans held the 1996 Olympic trials in March, four months before the Atlanta Games, giving swimmers a chance to decompress before building their training again toward the Olympics. The United States ended up winning 26 medals (13 gold) in Atlanta, more than any other country, in the home pool.</p>
        <p>Tom Dolan, who won the 400-meter individual medley in Atlanta, was highly critical of the United States swimming federation for not putting the same break between the 2000 trials and the Sydney Games. Athletes would essentially have to remain at their peaks from now through late September, he said after winning the 400-meter and 200-meter individual medleys at the trials.</p>
        <p>''Now it's one big meet that takes two months,'' Dolan said.</p>
        <p>But Don Talbot, who coaches the Australian Olympic swim team, said the Americans might benefit from holding the trials so close to the Olympics. It can be difficult for swimmers to regain their momentum and intensity in training when there is a long period between the two events, he said. The Americans will now train for two weeks in Pasadena, Calif., before beginning to taper their workouts as they point toward the Sydney Games. Swimming competition begins on Sept. 16.</p>
        <p>''We learned something from 1988,'' said Richard Quick, who will coach the American women's team in Sydney. ''We do need to have that balance of work and rest.''</p>
        <p>Nine American records were set at these trials, compared with none in 1996, but no world records were broken, compared with five world records set at the Australian trials in May. In Sydney, the American men will be favored to win six golds -- two by Lenny Krayzelburg, in the 100- and 200-meter backstrokes; Dolan in the 400 individual medley; and Tom Malchow in the 200-meter butterfly and a pair of relays. Gary Hall Jr. also swam the fastest 50-meter freestyle in an eight-lane competition and could upset Olympic champion, Aleksandr Popov of Russia. Ed Moses could also win the 100-meter breaststroke.</p>
        <p>The American women will be favored in only two individual events -- the defending Olympic champion Brooke Bennett in the 800-meter freestyle and 16-year-old Megan Quann in the 100-meter breaststroke.  In the sprints, Dara Torres, at age 33, will be the first American to swim in four Olympic Games. Jenny Thompson has been among the world leaders for a decade. But they will be underdogs in Sydney to Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands, who has set world records this year in the 50- and 100-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly.</p>
        <p>''We've got to improve,'' Quick said of the women's team. ''We're ranked No. 1 in the world in one event, the 800 freestyle. It's my belief we have athletes in many events that have the right to think about and prepare for winning efforts. But they will have to swim better than they ever have in their lives to do that.''</p>
