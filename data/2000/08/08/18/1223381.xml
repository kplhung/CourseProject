        <p>Milt Rosen, a versatile writer whose work included television scripts, comedy one-liners and books, died last Friday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 77.</p>
        <p>The cause was cancer, said a friend and author, Austin Kalisch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rose's more than a dozen books include ''The Second Book of Insults'' (1985), containing lines like: ''She's not very photogenic, especially in person,'' ''He stays longer in an hour than most people do in a week,'' and ''She's not the girl she used to be, and she never was.''</p>
        <p>He also edited the book ''More of the Best of Milton Berle's Private Joke File'' (1994, Avon). Berle and Arnold Schwarzenegger were among the celebrities he wrote one-liners for.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosen edited the book ''A Treasury of Sports Quotes and Wisdom'' (1999) Mr. Rosen and Robert Foster were nominated for an Edgar Award of the Mystery Writers of America in 1976 for an episode ''Murder Comes in Little Pills'' for the CBS series ''Kate McShane. Among the other television series Mr. Rosen wrote for were 'CHiPs,'' ''Lewis &amp; Clark,'' ''Mr. Novak'' and ''Tales of the Gold Monkey.''</p>
        <p>He was also a co-author of the screenplay for the film ''Do Not Disturb'' (1965) with Doris Day.</p>
        <p>Born in Poland, Mr. Rosen came to New York City with his family as a toddler and went on to graduate from City College. During World War II he became chief navigator of his squadron in the Eighth Air Force in the European Theater of Operations. He won the Air Medal five times, Mr. Kalisch said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosen taught in New York City public schools and moved to California in 1958.</p>
        <p>Surviving are his wife, Judy; a son, Joshua; two daughters, Stephanie Rimbach and Rachel Rosen, all of Los Angeles; and four grandchildren.</p>
