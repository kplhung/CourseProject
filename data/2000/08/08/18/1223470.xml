        <p>Vice President Al Gore accepted the Democratic presidential nomination last night with a forceful address designed to humanize him to the voters and to accelerate his drive to free himself from the understudy's role. Imploring Americans to take a fresh look at his life experiences and values, Mr. Gore issued a calculated declaration of independence from President Clinton. ''We're electing a new president, and I stand here tonight as my own man,'' he asserted, promising to fight against ''powerful forces'' on behalf of working Americans. And in a striking, unmistakable reference to the scandals of recent years, he drew a thunderous ovation by promising, ''I will work for you every day and I will never let you down.''</p>
        <p>Yet the center of Mr. Gore's sales pitch invoked the Clinton administration's economic record and laid out a budgetary approach that will clearly be a main theme of his campaign against Gov. George W. Bush. The vice president repeatedly hammered Mr. Bush as someone who would squander the surplus on ''a huge tax cut for the wealthy.'' Just as ardently he portrayed himself, over and over, as someone who would ''fight for working families.''</p>
        <p>He argued that the current economic abundance had brought an extraordinary opportunity to address the ills of American society.</p>
        <p>Racing through his speech and sometimes even stepping on his own applause lines, he offered an unusually detailed outline of the case for using the budget surplus to save Social Security and Medicare, provide prescription drugs to the elderly and offer limited tax cuts to help the middle class pay for college and health care. In a sense it was like a State of the Union address, but with an almost bellicose declaration that ''for all our good times, I am not satisfied.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore did not enter the Staples Center in Los Angeles with Mr. Clinton's gladiatorial dash through the corridors. Instead he came down an aisle as a determined underdog with a clear tactical mission. His campaign hopes the traditional convention ''bounce'' will put him within a few points of Governor Bush just as voters start to focus on the issues. The paradox is that voters do side with Mr. Gore on many issues he emphasized last night, particularly the economy and social concerns like gun control, abortion rights and protecting the environment. But to the dismay of Democrats, their agreement has not translated into political dominance or public acclaim for him.</p>
        <p>The twin goals of Mr. Gore's acceptance speech were clear. He was inviting listeners to look beyond the candidates' personalities to the issues that would make them very different presidents. He also hopes that the voters will rethink the stereotype of him as an automaton more comfortable with abstractions than with the everyday worries that Mr. Clinton empathized with, almost to the point of self-parody. Trying to turn his political defects into virtues, the vice president acknowledged that ''sometimes people say I'm too serious.'' But one of his biggest ovations came when he declared: ''The presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a day-by-day fight for people.'' In a kind of homage to his father's New Deal economic populism, Mr. Gore introduced members of the audience who he said deserved fairer, more caring treatment from a government that should not bestow undeserved tax-cut windfalls on the wealthy.</p>
        <p>After a week of the Democrats' hanging out at movie studios, it was striking how Mr. Gore tried to appeal to Americans alienated from the content of popular entertainment. Echoing the longstanding campaign of both his wife, Tipper, and his running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, he declared that ''we must challenge a culture with too much meanness, and not enough meaning.''</p>
        <p>It was said by Mr. Gore's staff that the vice president, a former newspaper reporter, had written his speech himself, and the address seemed to galvanize him. It drew waves of ovations from an audience that sometimes appeared impressed that he was trying -- often successfully -- to rise above his usual plodding delivery. Mr. Gore clearly did what he needed to do and impressed and perhaps surprised his audience in the process. He moved his party to full-throated support, and he sharply defined the battle lines for what could now turn into a close race over real policy differences.</p>
