        <p>The independent counsel investigating President Clinton's relationship with a White House intern has impaneled a new grand jury to hear evidence in the case, government officials said today.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The independent counsel investigating President Clinton's relationship with a White House intern has impaneled a new grand jury to hear evidence in the case, government officials said today.</p>
        <p>The independent counsel, Robert W. Ray, convened the panel last month as part of his publicly announced intention to consider whether Mr. Clinton should be charged with criminal wrongdoing in the case once he leaves office, the officials said.</p>
        <p>But the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was no indication that the decision to impanel the grand jury was based on any fresh evidence in the case. Nor did it indicate that prosecutors were preparing to seek an indictment soon, they said.</p>
        <p>The White House reacted angrily to the grand jury disclosure, which came hours before Vice President Al Gore was to accept the Democratic Party's nomination for president.</p>
        <p>''The timing of this leak reeks to high heaven,'' a White House spokesman, Jake Siewert, said.</p>
        <p>Karen P. Hughes, communications director for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee, called the timing unfortunate. ''We think the timing was wrong,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''It was simply not appropriate for this type of news to come out on Al Gore's big day. This election is not about the past and it's not about President Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Officials said the new grand jury was impaneled on July 11. But its existence became known only today, a day after a panel of three federal judges decided to allow the special prosecutor to continue his investigation for another year. It was unclear if the judges' decision had anything to do with the timing of today's leak to The Associated Press, which first reported the existence of the new grand jury, attributing the information to ''legal sources.''</p>
        <p>Officials in Mr. Ray's office were said today to be fearful that the disclosure would undercut their credibility and force an investigation into whether anyone in the office had provided the information.</p>
        <p>The independent counsel's office issued a statement that said: ''News organizations are reporting that a new grand jury has been impaneled to hear evidence with respect to the investigation involving allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice by President Clinton. This office has no comment with respect to these reports and will neither confirm nor deny them. These reports indicate, and we confirm, the source of these reports is not within the Office of the Independent Counsel.''</p>
        <p>Some Republicans, mindful that the 1998 impeachment of Mr. Clinton had probably contributed to their loss of seats in the House, expressed reluctance to see any re-emergence of the Clinton scandal story.</p>
        <p>''I think the timing is terrible,'' said Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, a Republican moderate from Connecticut. ''I wish he hadn't done this in a political season.''</p>
        <p>Rahm Emanuel, a former senior adviser to Mr. Clinton, said the news of Mr. Ray's office was ''brazenly political'' and predicted it would cause a backlash against Republicans.</p>
        <p>''I take my hat off to their gall,'' said Mr. Emanuel, now an investment banker in Chicago. ''But my gut tells me the American people, in their great wisdom, will once again recognize the political nature of this investigation.''</p>
        <p>Aides to Governor Bush declined to speculate on the political impact of Mr. Ray's action. But one spokesman said that the development would be viewed by the public as a reminder of the caustic climate in Washington during the Clinton years.</p>
        <p>''The American people are sick and tired of investigation and scandal,'' said Ray Sullivan, a Bush spokesman. ''The best way to change that and change the tone in Washington is to change administrations in the White House. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney aim to do just that.''</p>
        <p>The latest grand jury's work begins more than two and a half years after Mr. Ray's predecessor, Kenneth W. Starr, initiated his inquiry into Mr. Clinton's relationship with a White House intern, and more than a year and a half after the president was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr began his inquiry examining the Whitewater real estate development in Arkansas, and over the years expanded that investigation to include a number of other matters, including the intern issue.</p>
        <p>Although the independent counsel statute expired in June 1999, Mr. Ray remains in office because the investigation began before the law lapsed, assailed by both political parties as an unwieldy investigative bludgeon that failed in its intended purpose to remove politics from corruption cases against high-level administration officials.</p>
        <p>In interviews earlier this year, Mr. Ray, who took over from Mr. Starr last October, said he had completed the investigation into whether presidential aides engaged in wrongdoing in connection with the firing of employees at the White House travel office and with another matter, the collecting of hundreds of Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel files by White House employees. Mr. Ray decided against bringing charges in either case.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ray said that two matters remained open in an investigation that had cost $47 million as of October 1999. One continuing matter was if the White House improperly kept e-mail messages from Congressional and Justice Department investigators looking into a variety of accusations involving presidential aides.</p>
        <p>But the other, more incendiary, issue was whether Mr. Clinton could be charged with perjury or obstruction of justice when he denied having a relationship with the intern at a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment civil case against him.</p>
        <p>The judge in the Jones case has already found that Mr. Clinton testified falsely and fined him for civil contempt of court. The disciplinary committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court has also moved to revoke Mr. Clinton's law license.</p>
        <p>In impaneling the grand jury, Mr. Ray will seek to determine whether Mr. Clinton's testimony in the Jones case was sufficiently misleading to warrant bringing criminal charges against the president once he leaves office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray's office would not comment on any grand jury decision.</p>
        <p>The appellate court panel that re-authorized Mr. Ray to continue his work for another year decided that termination was ''not currently appropriate.'' Under the law, the panel must decide annually whether to discontinue investigations of independent counsels like Mr. Ray who were named before the law expired.</p>
        <p>A year ago, one of the three judges, Richard D. Cudahy, a Democratic appointee to the bench, said the ''endless investigation'' should be shut down when Mr. Starr stepped down. The two other judges, appointed under Republican administrations, Peter T. Fay and David B. Sentelle, the presiding judge, ruled that the office should continue. On Wednesday, the decision to keep the inquiry open was unanimous.</p>
        <p>Keith Ausbrook, senior counsel to Mr. Ray, said today that the judges' decision suggested that the prosecutor was making progress to conclude the inquiry. ''It reflects substantial progress in completing our work,'' Mr. Ausbrook said. ''It also reflects that there are open matters.''</p>
