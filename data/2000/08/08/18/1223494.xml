        <p>For three straight years, Alonzo Mourning has had to walk off his home court in Miami while watching the hated Knicks celebrate a playoff victory that ended the Heat's season. He does not want it to happen a fourth time, and based on the moves Miami has been making recently, there is a good chance it will not.</p>
        <p>Mourning was at the NBA Store in Manhattan yesterday, and he was naturally asked about the deals the Heat has made, or will soon make, that will produce a starting lineup next season of Mourning, Tim Hardaway, Eddie Jones, Anthony Mason and Brian Grant. It is a lineup that under the play-hard-or-play-elsewhere approach of Coach Pat Riley, may make things tough on everyone else in the Eastern Conference.</p>

        <p>For three straight years, Alonzo Mourning has had to walk off his home court in Miami while watching the hated Knicks celebrate a playoff victory that ended the Heat's season. He does not want it to happen a fourth time, and based on the moves Miami has been making recently, there is a good chance it will not.</p>
        <p>Mourning was at the NBA Store in Manhattan yesterday, and he was naturally asked about the deals the Heat has made, or will soon make, that will produce a starting lineup next season of Mourning, Tim Hardaway, Eddie Jones, Anthony Mason and Brian Grant. It is a lineup that under the play-hard-or-play-elsewhere approach of Coach Pat Riley, may make things tough on everyone else in the Eastern Conference.</p>
        <p>Asked about the deals yesterday, Mourning said: ''I had an idea, but I didn't think it would be of this magnitude. It looks good on paper, but you don't know until you hit the floor. I hope we can develop some chemistry quickly and that these guys can learn Riles's system. It's the toughest system in the league.''</p>
        <p>Mourning said he was excited that Jones, a 6-foot-6-inch guard, had been acquired by the Heat in a deal with Charlotte that also brought Mason to Miami but forced the Heat to give up P.J. Brown and Jamal Mashburn.</p>
        <p>''Jones is an All-Star in this league, but people underestimate his defense,'' Mourning said. ''He's led the league in steals the last two years, and that's what we emphasize.''</p>
        <p>As for Mason, and Grant, who will soon go to the Heat from Portland in a three-way deal that, by league requirements, cannot be completed for another week, Mourning said: ''The bigger, the better. Mason knows Riles's system, and that's a help. Grant's work ethic is impressive. I see similarities to myself in him. He's got a great attitude and he gives such an all-out, hard-nosed effort.''</p>
