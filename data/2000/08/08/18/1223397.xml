        <p>The excellence of Tiger Woods has become expected, particularly at major championships. Was anyone surprised that Woods opened the P.G.A. Championship with a six-under-par 66? You could almost hear some of his competitors saying to themselves, ''There he goes again.''</p>
        <p>Forget the thought of Woods getting off to a slow start. If Woods is to be denied his third consecutive major championship,  someone at Valhalla Golf Club will have to play superb golf to beat him. Today, on a sultry Kentucky afternoon, Scott Dunlap, who has never won a PGA Tour event,  shot 66 to tie Woods for first place. Darren Clarke, who defeated Woods this year in the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship, was tied for third place at 68, along with Davis Love III, the 1997 P.G.A. champion.</p>
        <p>Play was suspended at 8:27 p.m. with 18 players still on the course.</p>
        <p>The tightly bunched leader board, which featured many players under par, gave credence to the theory that it may be harder for Woods to run away with this major. Many players have the ability to shoot low scores this weekend. But the big question remained the same. Will anyone shoot lower than Woods?</p>
        <p>''Tiger has won the last two majors by 23 shots combined,'' said Dunlap after his  round, which included five birdies, one bogey and a chip-in eagle at No. 2 that  jump-started his day. ''His presence is nothing but discouraging to everyone else in the field.</p>
        <p>''If he's going to do it, he's going to do it. There is no stopping him. All I can do is come out tomorrow, play another good round and take it from there.''</p>
        <p>Woods intends to take another championship and become the first player to win three consecutive majors since Ben Hogan in 1953. Woods took advantage of his 9:13 a.m. tee time, playing most of his round before the afternoon temperature reached 91 degrees, with a heat index of 100. It was telling that Woods, Dunlap, Clarke and Love  teed off before 10:30 a.m. Those who played  in the afternoon felt as if they were in a sauna with the temperature gauge stuck on high. Some of the afternoon rounds were painfully slow.</p>
        <p>Several of the pre-tournament favorites struggled, including Hal Sutton (74), Sergio Garcia (74), Vijay Singh (77) and Tom Lehman (82). But despite the hoopla surrounding Woods as he entered this tournament, he remained unflappable. Woods was paired with Jack Nicklaus and Singh, marking the first time that Nicklaus and Woods had ever been paired together in a competitive round. As expected, their gallery was the biggest and the most boisterous, yet Woods played with machine-like efficiency, making seven birdies and just one bogey.</p>
        <p>Want more bad news for the competition? Woods putted well. And when Woods putts well at majors, he usually wins.</p>
        <p>''Any time you shoot 66 in a major championship, you are going to be happy,'' said Woods, who said he enjoyed playing with Nicklaus, who shot a 77. But Woods never lost sight of his goal. ''It was an honor to play with Jack. To be honest, though, when I am on that first tee, I could care less who I am playing with. I am trying to put myself in position to win a major championship.''</p>
        <p>That is exactly what Woods did, and from the moment Woods's name appeared on the leader board, his opponents knew it meant trouble. Woods can bunch birdies together at any time, on any golf course, and you can never tell when a torrid stretch might begin.</p>
        <p>Today, it started at the par-5 seventh. Playing at even par through six holes, Woods birdied Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 10 to reach four under par. At the 597-yard seventh, Woods reached the green in two shots with a driver and a 7-iron, then two-putted from 30 feet. At No. 8, he made a 12-foot putt. At No. 9, he made another 12-footer. And at the par-5 10th hole, after missing the green with his second shot, Woods hit a beautiful chip from behind the green that stopped three feet from the cup, setting up an easy birdie putt.  Woods added another 12-foot birdie putt at No. 12, and he birdied the par-5 finishing hole, hitting his second shot into the green-side bunker, then blasting out to three feet to set up the birdie putt.</p>
        <p>While Woods is accustomed to leading majors, Dunlap, who turned 37 Wednesday, continued his celebration with a superb round. The highlights included his chip-in eagle at No. 2, a 35-foot birdie putt at No. 9, a 20-foot putt to save par at No. 15. and an up-and-down birdie from a bunker at No. 18. Dunlap entered the tournament unsure of how he would perform, having not played since last month's British Open, and still feeling somewhat drained after fighting a bad cold last week. His best finish this year is a tie for third at The Players Championship, so Dunlap realized he was a long shot to keep pace with Woods for three more days. That didn't mean Dunlap wouldn't try.</p>
        <p>''We all know I have not won on the PGA Tour yet,'' Dunlap said. ''But you never know when your first one is going to be. Jeff Sluman's first one was the P.G.A., so why not mine?''</p>
        <p>Woods, however, had different ideas. And as he went to bed with a share of the lead, it was an unsettling thought for the rest of the field, thinking about a player who shows no mercy in majors.</p>
        <p>''It used to be you could slip up a couple of times, have three very good rounds and one O.K. round, and still win the championship,'' said Curtis Strange, who shot a 72. ''Not any more.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>DUDLEY HART, ranked No. 27 in the world, withdrew following an opening-round 79 because of a bad back.</p>
