        <p>Agilent Technologies Inc., the test and measurement equipment business spun out of Hewlett-Packard, reported third-quarter earnings yesterday that met analysts' estimates. For the quarter ended July 31, Agilent reported earnings of $155 million, or 34 cents a share, up 15 percent from $135 million, or 36 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Per share figures reflect an increase in the number of shares outstanding. Sales rose 28 percent, to $2.67 billion, from $2.09 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 1999. Taking into account the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options, Agilent had pro forma earnings per share of 33 cents, equal to the consensus estimate provided by First Call. Earlier this week, Agilent said its unprofitable Healthcare Solutions Group would begin a global reorganization program to reduce its regular work force of approximately 5,000, by about 450 people by the end of October.</p>
