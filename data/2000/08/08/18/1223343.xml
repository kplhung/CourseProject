        <p>Robert Greenwald said the idea for making his new film, ''Steal This Movie!,'' about the life of the 1960's radical-prankster Abbie Hoffman, began when he was talking to his daughters.</p>
        <p>''They're in their 20's, college-educated young women who had great interest and excitement about the 60's,'' he said. ''You know, the tie-dyed clothes, the music. They even heard rumors there were drugs back then. But they didn't know much more about it than that.''</p>

        <p>Robert Greenwald said the idea for making his new film, ''Steal This Movie!,'' about the life of the 1960's radical-prankster Abbie Hoffman, began when he was talking to his daughters.</p>
        <p>''They're in their 20's, college-educated young women who had great interest and excitement about the 60's,'' he said. ''You know, the tie-dyed clothes, the music. They even heard rumors there were drugs back then. But they didn't know much more about it than that.''</p>
        <p>A short while later, while at a Los Angeles bookstore, he came across an old copy of ''Letters From the Underground,'' the book of correspondence between Hoffman, who died in 1989, and his wife, Anita, during the years that Hoffman was living on the run from the law. ''It was a wonderful love story,'' Mr. Greenwald said. ''A bell went off. This would make a wonderful movie.''</p>
        <p>If anything, he said, the sudden re-emergence of mass street protests -- at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle last year, at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia and, again this week, at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles -- has only made the story of Hoffman's emergence at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago and his subsequent trial, flight and descent into manic-depression more relevant.</p>
        <p>''Originally, when we finished the movie and delivered it to Lions Gate Films to be distributed, the thinking was that it would appeal mostly to people who were there back then, to baby boomers and others interested in the nostalgia factor,'' Mr. Greenwald said. ''Then, after the W.T.O. demonstrations, it was like an alarm clock went off. We started getting letters from youth groups all around the country who wanted to screen the film.</p>
        <p>''You know, there's a scene in the film where the protesters are trying to get a permit, and they keep getting the runaround, and it's the same sort of thing that happened to the protesters in Philadelphia and Los Angeles this year. It's eerie, like history repeating itself.''</p>
        <p>After he read the book, he said, he tracked down Anita Hoffman in California and got to know her. ''We played volleyball together in Venice, like all good radicals,'' he said. He told her how he had discussed the 60's with his daughters, found her book and now wanted to make it into a movie. ''She said: 'Absolutely not. It's Hollywood and they'll just screw it up.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenwald said he had promised to make the movie independent of any studio -- ''there wasn't any studio that was going to make a movie on this subject, anyway'' -- and to show her every draft of the screenplay. He also sent her some of the television movies he had made in the past, like ''Forgotten Prisoners'' in 1990 (about a crusading lawyer for Amnesty International) and ''The Burning Bed'' in 1984 (about spousal abuse), and finally Mrs. Hoffman said he could go ahead.</p>
        <p>That was three and a half years ago, Mr. Greenwald said. He commissioned a screenplay, began to interview people about Hoffman's life and started to think about casting and raising production money. ''We got very lucky,'' he said. ''There was something called a hedge fund. I'll never understand what it is, but they had the money and wanted to invest it.'' In the end, Vincent D'Onofrio was cast as Abbie and Janeane Garofalo as Anita, who died in late 1998.</p>
        <p>Two screenings were arranged this week in Los Angeles for some of the people who were in town to protest at the convention. And the film's limited release begins today in New York and a few other cities (review, Weekend, Page 1).</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Greenwald said, he hopes his daughters will have at least a little better understanding of what the 60's were about. ''This movie is about that period of time,'' he said. ''And Abbie is the tour guide.''</p>
        <p>Ramblin' Jack Revisited</p>
        <p>Aiyana Elliott said she ''did not intend to make a personal film when I set out to make this movie; I wanted to make as objective a film about my dad as I could.'' But in the making, ''The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack,'' a documentary about her father, the folk singer Jack Elliott, turned into a far more personal film than she had anticipated.</p>
        <p>''I think it was this interview I did with my mother,'' Ms. Elliott said. ''She was just talking to me, her daughter, and talking about what it had been like for me to grow up with my dad on the road all the time. And when we brought the footage back to New York, our editor looked at it and said that it was really interesting. It changed the whole direction of the picture.''</p>
        <p>Her film was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in January with her father in the audience to see it for the first time. He had resisted making the film, she said, and was not at all comfortable with some of the more personal material about their family life. ''But I think it helped for him to see it with an audience,'' she said, ''to hear them laugh and to applaud and to see how people were reacting to his story.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Elliott is a contemporary of such legendary folk artists as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, and in the critically acclaimed film, which opened in New York on Wednesday, their stories intertwine with his.</p>
        <p>''I started out thinking it would be a more traditional verite film, following my dad around with the camera, listening to his stories,'' she said. ''It would be a natural. But then the movie changed, and it was very difficult to tell such a personal story, sometimes very painful. I often wondered if it wasn't just creating more tension and problems for me and my dad, but in the end, I think we have gotten closer because of it.''</p>
        <p>The Men of Summer</p>
        <p>Michael Dinner said he hadn't seen Clint Eastwood's ''Space Cowboys'' yet, and it's just a coincidence that he, too, had a summer movie coming out in which older actors played the central roles. ''It's kind of nice to be able to see these actors in a summer movie,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dinner's film is ''The Crew,'' opening next Friday, a comedy about a foursome of aging gangsters in a Miami Beach hotel who inadvertently find themselves in a dangerous duel with a South American drug lord. Burt Reynolds, Richard Dreyfuss, Dan Hedaya and Seymour Cassell play the old wise guys.</p>
        <p>''Maybe the audience is used to the big extravaganzas, and now it's August and maybe it's time for some older actors and some smaller movies that aren't all about special effects,'' Mr. Dinner said. ''There's always the conventional wisdom that in the summer the kids are out of school, so all the movies have to be geared to kids. Maybe the success of a 'Space Cowboys' can show that it doesn't always have to be like that. Besides, I grew up watching all of these actors. It's fun to see them working in a summer movie again.''</p>
