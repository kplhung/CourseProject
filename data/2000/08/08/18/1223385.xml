        <p>The business of straightening teeth has always been a small-scale, fairly low-tech affair -- a one-on-one interaction between orthodontist and patient, usually an adolescent.</p>
        <p>Colored ''designer'' bands and clear ceramic brackets held in place by a wire may have supplanted the tortured metal-mouth look, but this has been a world of incremental change mostly beyond the reach of computers, Wall Street and the other trappings of the new economy.</p>
        <p>Until now. It seems a stretch that a classic Silicon Valley start-up could create a role for itself in this highly local profession, but that is exactly what seems to be happening with Align Technology, a manufacturer of a clear-plastic alternative to braces aimed at appearance-conscious adults.</p>
        <p>Zia Chishti and Kelsey Wirth, the young co-founders of Align, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., drew the attention of many orthodontists with their claim that computers could be used to design and make a customized series of plastic retainers for each patient that would gradually move their teeth as prescribed by the orthodontist.</p>
        <p>''Believe me, this is the last thing I ever thought I'd do,'' said Ms. Wirth, Align's 30-year-old president, recalling how she hated her braces in high school. But, she said, Mr. Chishti's vision of the technology seemed to fit her search for an opportunity to ''build a company and revolutionize an industry.''</p>
        <p>Unlike braces advertised as invisible but held in place by a wire, Align's product is transparent. Instead of visiting the orthodontist to have braces adjusted, patients would simply switch to the next retainer in the series every two weeks.</p>
        <p>Align claims that roughly half the nation's 8,500 orthodontists have attended a seminar and invested in the equipment necessary to offer its product, an astonishingly rapid technology deployment for such a conservative industry.</p>
        <p>Now, armed with promising early results and backed by venture capital on a scale that has stunned the industry, Align is unrolling the most aggressive consumer advertising plan the dental profession has ever seen. ''It has to be 10 times more than anyone else has ever done,'' said Charles Schultz, general manager of GAC International, a leading supplier of braces and other orthodontic supplies.</p>
        <p>The Align system, marketed under the Invisalign brand, is already inspiring competitors. For instance, GAC recently began offering an all-plastic device designed by Dr. Keith Hilliard, a Florida orthodontist. That device, formed in the orthodontist's office by drawing a vacuum seal over a model of the mouth, can be adjusted by the orthodontist to push teeth in a desired direction using pliers.</p>
        <p>Align's ambitious plans are based on research gathered by the American Association of Orthodontists concluding that although fewer than 1 percent of American adults have severe orthodontic problems, more than 100 million adults with lesser dental irregularities are potential candidates for orthodontics. Only 400,000, or one-half of one percent of adults, get braces each year, so Align believes there is a huge untapped market.</p>
        <p>''Some people don't care about their appearance, and others do but can't tolerate the burdens of correcting it,'' said Mr. Chishti, Align's 29-year-old chief executive. ''We are going to attack both groups with marketing, and it will be a huge market-expansion opportunity for everyone.''</p>
        <p>Competitors in the $450 million orthodontics supply industry are hoping so. They are eagerly awaiting the biggest step yet in Align's marketing program -- a $31 million campaign starting in September that will be the first effort by an orthodontics products company to appeal directly to consumers through television.</p>
        <p>The expectation is that many consumers responding to the ads will instead end up persuaded to try more standard treatments. Some will discover that they have more severe problems than Align is willing to tackle, and others are likely to balk at the 50 percent premium over braces that many orthodontists charge for Invisalign.</p>
        <p>Invisalign starts with an orthodontist making an imprint of the patient's teeth in a plastic material that is sent to Align along with the orthodontist's prescription of how the teeth should be moved to attain a desired final appearance.</p>
        <p>Patients with severe overbites, underbites and other serious problems are excluded, as are all children because growing jaws and erupting teeth are too complicated for Align's computer to model. But if the adult's deformities are mild enough to fall within Align's specification, Align develops an animated computer program -- a process that takes three weeks to a month and is handled by computer technicians in Pakistan -- that can be downloaded over the Internet and will show how the teeth will move.</p>
        <p>Once the treatment plan depicted by the animation is approved by the patient's orthodontist, the specifications are transmitted to Align's manufacturing plant in Mexico. The patient gets the first aligner six weeks after the initial visit. Most treatments require 20 to 60 aligners, which are worn approximately two weeks each. If the patient is following directions, they are taken off only for eating and tooth-brushing.</p>
        <p>Orthodontists have mixed feelings about Align. Jennifer Salzer, whose practice is on Park Avenue in New York, is in the fifth month of wearing the aligners. She and her partners have more than 40 patients using them. ''People who don't get involved are going to be left behind,'' she told 135 orthodontists and assistants who attended a one-day course Align offered in New York recently.</p>
        <p>The New York audience included plenty of skeptics who said that Invisalign would make sense for only a small percentage of their patients, many of whom might fare just as well with a retainer, which is far cheaper. A treatment that might cost several thousand dollars with Invisalign might be done for several hundred dollars with a retainer, they say. Others said that treatment with the aligners, like all removable dental appliances, is prone to failure if patients do not wear them around the clock.</p>
        <p>Align asserts that orthodontists using Invisalign have increased profits on the order of 30 percent because, without the need to adjust braces, they need less ''chair time'' for each patient. But some said that orthodontists who work mostly with children could find productivity going down if Invisalign brings in more adults, because adults always take up more time with questions than children.</p>
        <p>Whatever their doubts, orthodontists who delay preparing to offer Invisalign risk being viewed as behind the times once the television advertising campaign takes off, said Dr. George W. Scott, an orthodontist in Middletown, N.J., and former president of the New Jersey Orthodontists Association. ''I'm here only because I'm afraid,'' he said with a laugh at the end of the New York meeting.</p>
        <p>Many other orthodontists say their biggest fear is that Align's drive to grow will eventually lead it to offer its system through general dentists, thus eating into their practices.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wirth said that Invisalign does nothing to simplify orthodontics and that the company could not rely on dentists to use it appropriately.</p>
        <p>New technology has traditionally crept slowly into the market, with practitioners developing devices they eventually sold to companies like GAC International; the Ormco subsidiary of Sybron; or 3M Unitek, a subsidiary of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. Some misunderstandings and suspicion seem inevitable given that Mr. Chishti and Ms. Wirth come out of the hothouse of Silicon Valley with no background in dentistry.</p>
        <p>The two entrepreneurs met as classmates at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. Mr. Chishti, a native of Pakistan who had been a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company and a financial analyst at Morgan Stanley, became intrigued at how his teeth, which had been straightened by braces, would drift out of position when he neglected to wear his plastic retainer and how the retainer moved them back to the proper place. It did not take much research to learn that orthodontists had been talking as far back as 1945 about the possibility of using a sequence of removable plastic appliances instead of braces to move teeth toward a predetermined end point. Many had used simple plastic devices fashioned in their offices for minor adjustments.</p>
        <p>But no one could figure out how to make wider use of plastic aligners practical until Mr. Chishti and Ms. Wirth, a former environmental consultant and investment banker, set up Align in 1997 to apply computers to the problem. Not only could computers be used to design the sequence of aligners, they realized, but stereo lithography, a computer-driven process widely used by design engineers in industry for building plastic models layer by layer, could be the key to inexpensive automated production.</p>
        <p>The first venture capitalists they approached did not share the vision. Some laughed at the idea of putting money into unfashionable orthodontic supplies, Ms. Wirth recalled. The industry leaders were equally unimpressed. GAC declined to invest because Align could not show them any results with patients, Mr. Schultz said.</p>
        <p>But after Joseph S. Lacob, a general partner at Silicon Valley's most famous venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, became enthusiastic in 1997 just 15 minutes into Mr. Chishti's presentation, doors began to swing open.</p>
        <p>The company recently collected $100 million from institutions and wealthy individuals in its fourth round of financing. It was managed by Robertson Stephens, the San Francisco-based investment bank where Ms. Wirth worked before heading for Stanford.</p>
        <p>The company had offers for an additional $100 million to $200 million that it turned away, Ms. Wirth said. The next step is likely to be a public offering, possibly before the end of the year. Some orthodontists, like Dr. Michael Steinberg, of Millburn, N.J., say such a step would be encouraging because they want to be sure the company has the resources to stay in business if they are going to start many of their patients on treatments that can easily last more than a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chishti is certainly prepared for a road show. He likes to drive home the point that the devices are next to invisible by nonchalantly popping out his current aligner, which invariably has gone unnoticed until that moment.</p>
        <p>''It gets a good reaction,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 21, 2000, Monday  An article in Business Day on Friday about new technologies in ortho dontics misidentified the firm that managed the most recent round of financing for Align Technology, which makes a clear-plastic alternative to braces. It was Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, not Robertson Stephens.</p>
