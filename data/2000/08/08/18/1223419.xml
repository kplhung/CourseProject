        <p>Robin Ventura sometimes seems to be a victim of his past success. Whenever he contributes offensively, he is asked if he thinks he is coming around, if he feels good and might be taking off as a hitter.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Ventura went 2 for 2 to raise his average to .241, 60 points lower than it was last year. He homered in the Mets' 13-2 victory over the Colorado Rockies, and his production has been fine with 20 home runs and 69 runs batted in. But that batting average has to bother him, right?</p>
        <p>''When we're in the situation we're in, I don't sit there and think, 'I'm not coming around,' '' Ventura said. ''I feel pretty good at the plate, and that's all I worry about. If I helped us win today, that's great. The only thing that matters right now is what I do from tomorrow to the end of the year.''</p>
        <p>Ventura, who has been bothered by a sore right rotator cuff, went through a midseason slump with 8 hits in 50 at-bats. But he is not indifferent to his season-long struggles. He is third on the team in R.B.I., but he needs to get on base and start rallies more often. Now that his shoulder is healthy again, the third baseman is again optimistic he will be a factor on offense. ''That's something I think is going to get better,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ventura contributed in all four plate appearances yesterday, driving in runs on sacrifice flies in the first and the third, singling and scoring in the fifth and lining a homer in the sixth. He was one of four Mets who hit home runs, including Todd Zeile, whose homer was the 200th of his career.</p>
        <p>Zeile kept the baseball, but he was unaware of the feat until Manager Bobby Valentine mentioned it in the dugout. In an era when Mark McGwire and company regularly break home run records, 200 in 12 years does not mean much. ''It's like four years of McGwire,'' Zeile said.</p>
        <p>Valentine considered giving Zeile the day off, but the first baseman, who is a career .307 hitter against the Rockies, asked to play. He also wants to play in front of his family in the Mets' next three games, in Los Angeles. Zeile led the majors in innings played from 1996 to 1999, and although he leads the Mets in games played this year, he said it feels odd to have had four days off.</p>
        <p>''I've taken more days off this year than I've probably had the last few years combined,'' Zeile said. ''That's one thing I actually credit Bobby for. I think he does a good job of working other players in and resting guys, keeping them fresh.''</p>
        <p>Zeile has needed the rest; he was sick during a road trip last month, lost eight or nine pounds and is just now feeling better. He had 7 hits in his last 44 at-bats before the Rockies came to town, then went 7 for 12 in the four-game series.</p>
        <p>Besides Ventura and Zeile, Benny Agbayani and Mike Bordick hit homers for the Mets.</p>
        <p>Bordick's homer was his fourth for the Mets and 20th over all; the shortstop did not hit his 20th career home run until 1996, his seventh major league season. Agbayani hit his 10th homer of the year, giving the Mets seven players with at least 10 home runs for the first time since 1990.</p>
        <p>''A lot of teams think the bottom of our order is weak,'' Agbayani said. ''Once they get through the middle of the lineup, they probably think, 'Okay, we're out of the jam.' It helps us a lot. If we're one through eight strong, we're going to be a very good team.''</p>
        <p>They were a very good team yesterday, piling on 13 runs for the first time in months. The Mets have won mostly close, low-scoring games lately, and a blowout like the one yesterday was a nice change in the pattern.</p>
        <p>''A win's a win,'' Ventura said. ''But if you could sit there and pick which ones you'd want to have, you'd pick these.''</p>
