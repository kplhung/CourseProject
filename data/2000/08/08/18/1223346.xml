        <p>The Martha Graham Dance Company has not performed since the troupe suspended activities in May because of continuing friction between the Graham board and Ron Protas, the director of the company and of the Martha Graham Trust, which licenses Graham's dances.

        <p>The Martha Graham Dance Company has not performed since the troupe suspended activities in May because of continuing friction between the Graham board and Ron Protas, the director of the company and of the Martha Graham Trust, which licenses Graham's dances. But dancers manage to find ways to dance. Current and former company members did just that on Wednesday evening in Union Square Park in ''Keeping the Channels Open,'' a program of their own work presented by the Summer in the Square 2000 festival.</p>
        <p>Tadej Brdnik didn't give Katherine Crocket much to do in an inexplicably anguished solo from his ''In Every You, One of Me,'' set to droning music by Guy Klucevsek. But Ms. Crocket clenched and stretched her body with impressive eloquence.</p>
        <p>Javier Dzul and Miriam Barbosa were stylized ancestral figures in Mr. Dzul's ''Y'Itz Ka'anil,'' danced to music by Antonio Zepeda and Jorge Reyes. The duet stood out for its intricate and sometimes risky- looking partnering. It would have been much improved, however, by some stringent editing.</p>
        <p>Jacqulyn Buglisi, the most experienced of the nine choreographers, was represented by two pieces. ''Sospiri,'' a romantic duet to music by Elgar, received a lush and lyrical performance from Virginie Victoire Mecene and Kevin Predmore. An excerpt from Ms. Buglisi's ''Red Hills,'' a work inspired by Georgia O'Keeffe's ''Red Hills With Sun,'' was as thin and repetitive as Mr. Brdnik's solo. But Jennifer DePalo swung her hair and body around with passion, to music by Liszt.</p>
        <p>Errol Grimes's ''As I Lay Lying,'' danced to music by Villa Lobos, made the most of Martin Lofsnes's long tapering body, dressing it in high-waisted red tights and placing it on a large orange disc like a hand on a large clock.</p>
        <p>''The Burghers of Calais,'' a solo choreographed by Gary Galbraith and Karen Potter to music by Arvo Part, effectively juxtaposed Mr. Galbraith's tall angular body with the flaring fabric of a long tunic. But the choreographers need to break away from the Graham canon a little more. And some stories are better told less literally than this.</p>
        <p>Two of the program's most appealing works came from Erica Dankmeyer and Kun-Yang Lin. Ms. Dankmeyer's ''Forest Incantation,'' set to music by John Williams, was a dance for two mercurial wood sprites with quick-moving feet. Ms. Dankmeyer and Alessandra Prosperi were first-rate in the roles, wearing stylish costumes designed by Leslie Myers that were the color of night leaves.</p>
        <p>''Pilgrimage,'' the opening section of Mr. Lin's ''Land of Lost Content,'' moved a wedge of six dancers across the stage slowly to music by Philip Glass. Silently chattering mouths and strange gestures for the fingers added texture to this Wigmanesque ritual, which had a powerful simplicity. ''Pilgrimage'' was danced by Jennifer Binford, Mr. Brdnik, Mr. Galbraith, Mr. Lin, Nai-Yu Kuo and Ms. Mecene. The handsome costumes were designed by Tamaki Kawano and Maika Misumi.</p>
        <p>The dance component of the free festival continues with programs by the Battery Dance Company on Wednesday and by Carol Fonda and Company on Aug. 30.</p>
