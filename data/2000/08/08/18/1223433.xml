        <p>Although the tragedy with Russia's Kursk submarine has placed an urgent spotlight on the need for rescue craft, the United States Navy is planning to retire one of its two best undersea rescue vehicles at the end of August in a cost-cutting move that could make it harder to save stricken American submariners, military officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The deep-diving craft are among the vessels that the United States offered to send this week to try to save any Kursk sailors still trapped under 350 feet of arctic water.</p>
        <p>Defense experts say that if the Russian Navy had accepted the offer, it would have had a much greater chance -- though no guarantee -- of saving any survivors than it has had with its own equipment.</p>
        <p>Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, confirmed that one of the minisubmarines, the Avalon, is to be retired at the end of this month. The decision was made long before the Kursk sank last weekend, and Navy officials said they had no plans to reconsider.</p>
        <p>The Navy plans to build a new generation of rescue vehicles in the next five years. The officials said they could get help from other Western nations if a crisis taxed their other rescue capabilities.</p>
        <p>But critics said there could be pressure from Congress to keep the Avalon in use until the new equipment is ready. After the Kursk disaster, Norman Polmar, an independent Navy analyst, said, ''I think the decision demands a re-evaluation.''</p>
        <p>The Avalon and its sister craft, the Mystic, have been based in San Diego for nearly 30 years but have never been needed for a rescue operation. The United States has lost only two nuclear-powered submarines, the Thresher and the Scorpion. Both sank in the 1960's in such deep waters that there was no chance of saving anyone.</p>
        <p>As a result, even many submariners take little comfort in the idea that the vehicles were available. The Avalon and the Mystic theoretically can rescue 24 men at a time at depths of up to 2,000 feet, while in most areas of the oceans, a stricken submarine would plunge tens of thousands of feet, disintegrating along the way.</p>
        <p>Both craft operate under their own battery power and can maneuver themselves onto the hatches of sunken submarines to rescue the crew.</p>
        <p>The Russians have relied on less-advanced gear, including diving bells that dangle from a surface ship and are hard to guide.</p>
        <p>If the Russians had asked for help immediately after the Kursk sank, United States officials said, either the Avalon or the Mystic could have been flown to a Russian port by Monday and carried to the Kursk by a Russian cargo ship.</p>
        <p>One concern was whether the hatches on the American craft would have fit tightly enough with the hatches on the Russian submarine. Another was whether the Kursk was leaning too far toward one side for the rescue craft to connect to it.</p>
        <p>But after Russian officials finally requested international help on Wednesday, Great Britain dispatched a smaller rescue submarine. It is expected to reach the Kursk on Saturday. And though that could be too late to save any crew members who survived the submarine's plunge to the seabed, British authorities said yesterday that their hatches should match up with the Kursk's.</p>
        <p>They also quoted Russian officials as saying that the Kursk is listing only 20 degrees, and not 60 degrees, as previously announced. That raises the possibility that either the Avalon or the Mystic, which were designed to work at angles of up to 45 percent, could have carried out a rescue.</p>
        <p>Under the Pentagon's plan, the Mystic will remain in use until 2005, when the next rescue devices are scheduled to be completed.</p>
        <p>But the rescue craft require periodic overhauls, and critics worry about what might happen if a submarine were to sink when the Mystic is not available. The Navy's backup would be two old diving bells similar to some tested by the Russians this week, though American officials say they could also seek help from Britain and other countries.</p>
        <p>Some Navy veterans also fear that the next generation of rescue equipment may be less capable in some ways. No one questions that the Avalon and the Mystic are aging and need to be replaced.</p>
        <p>But while they theoretically could carry 24 submariners to safety at a time, the replacement systems will be centered around diving bells that might be able to rescue only 12 men on each descent.</p>
        <p>The bells would be far more sophisticated and manueverable than current ones, Navy officials said, adding that they also could be transported more easily and quickly to rescue sites. And their efforts would be augmented by deep-sea divers, who would be able to aid rescue efforts at much greater depths. Navy officials said they are buying four high-tech diving suits, at $1.5 million each, that will allow divers to go as far underwater as 2,000 feet.</p>
