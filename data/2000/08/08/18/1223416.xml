        <p>When Gov. George E.

        <p>When Gov. George E. Pataki visited the newly opened New Covenant Charter School in Albany last September, he lavished it with praise, proclaiming it a model of the kind of educational change he intended when he pushed a charter school bill through the State Legislature nine months earlier.</p>
        <p>In the months after Mr. Pataki's visit, however, New Covenant descended into apparent chaos. Its fourth-graders scored among the lowest in the state on standardized English tests; the for-profit company overseeing the school's academic program resigned; two principals came and went, as did one-fourth of the school's 500 students.</p>
        <p>Aaron Dare, founder of the school and president of the local Urban League chapter, whom Mr. Pataki hailed during his visit as ''a visionary,'' quit the New Covenant board after two state inquiries accused him and the school of multiple violations of state education law, including misappropriation of tax dollars.</p>
        <p>Now, with three weeks to go before the scheduled start of the new school year, state regulators have threatened to revoke the school's charter, and it is uncertain when, or even if, New Covenant will open again.</p>
        <p>How things went so wrong so quickly at New Covenant is a cautionary tale for entrepreneurs and education reformers who are attracted by the potential of charter schools, which have been hailed around the country as one of the most promising solutions to the problems plaguing public education, particularly in poor minority school districts in the inner city.</p>
        <p>The nation's 2,069 charter schools operate with public money but are free of the control of local school districts. They are often championed by conservatives and liberals alike, who see them as a competitive alternative to troubled public schools because of their ability to experiment with teaching methods and to hire nonunion teachers.</p>
        <p>That such a spectacular failure could occur practically in Mr. Pataki's backyard, at a school in which he took a close interest, speaks of the difficulties -- in oversight, administration and academic achievement -- in starting a charter school.</p>
        <p>Some critics contend, however, that New Covenant's failures were not simply bad luck but rather a direct result of an unnecessary rush last year by Mr. Pataki, a vocal champion of charter schools, and his political appointees to open new schools without time for adequate planning and training. New Covenant received its initial approval a mere three months before it opened.</p>
        <p>Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the State Assembly's education committee, said, ''New Covenant is a case study of how not to do a charter school.''</p>
        <p>Around the country, 79 charter schools, or about 4 percent of the charter schools started in the past nine years, have shut their doors, though many others have established a successful foothold, including two New York City charter schools that opened at the same time as New Covenant: the Sisulu Children's Academy and the John A. Reisenbach school, both in Harlem.</p>
        <p>Suzanne Morris, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said that the state's review process for new charter schools, including New Covenant, was very thorough. While no one expected things to go as wrong as they did at New Covenant in the last year, she said, ''the governor does not believe this particular situation is a reflection on the future of charter schools,'' which he believes is ''quite positive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dare said yesterday that tax money was not used for any purpose other than to improve the school. ''There's never been anything done by me or anyone at the school that was malicious or not in the best interests of the children,'' he said. Ward DeWitt, co-chairman of New Covenant's board, said he was confident that New Covenant would open this fall.</p>
        <p>Last week, the board asked state authorities to allow Edison Schools in Manhattan, the country's largest for-profit operator of public schools, to replace Advantage Schools, an education company based in Boston, as manager of New Covenant's academic programs in the coming year. Edison hired Eleanor P. Bartlett, a member of the State Board of Regents, as principal of the school, and Ms. Bartlett resigned from the Regents to take the job.</p>
        <p>Before the school can open, charter school regulators at the State University of New York, the Education Department and the Board of Regents must once again hastily review Edison's proposed academic program, in even less time than they did last year.</p>
        <p>At issue is whether Edison and the newly reorganized school board will be able to correct the faults detailed by two regulatory panels, which issued their independent reports within a week of each other in late July and early this month.</p>
        <p>Near the end of the school year, a team of observers from the Education Department visited New Covenant, in the Arbor Hill neighborhood near the State Capitol. The team found ''serious violations of law and of the school's charter,'' including inadequate academic programs, building code violations and students who were missing or unaccounted for. The report said that the school, housed in trailers, ''appeared to be very rundown'' and overcrowded, with some classes being taught in hallways, where carpets were mended with duct tape.</p>
        <p>A separate review by the State University of New York, which granted the school its charter, found many of the same problems as well as a lack of financial controls. SUNY also reported conflicts of interest among school board members, many of whom were also affiliated with the Urban League and some of whom were relatives of Mr. Dare. One board member was his aunt and another was the husband of his mother.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Pataki, speaking last week on an Albany radio program, said that he had ''reservations'' about the school's ability to reopen next month.</p>
        <p>Doubts about whether the school will reopen have left the 386 children who completed its first academic year uncertain about where they will go this year; board members said many of the children intended to enroll again this year at New Covenant, which is for kindergarten through fifth grade.</p>
        <p>''This school really was the result of a grass-roots effort that was pushed by the community,'' Mr. DeWitt said. ''People here were looking for a bona fide choice to move their children's education along. With that kind of momentum, it would have been hard to tell them to wait for a more deliberate process.''</p>
        <p>From the beginning, there were signs that the approval process was being rushed and that problems were on the horizon. In June 1999, shortly after the SUNY trustees approved a September opening that year for New Covenant and two other charter schools, questions were raised about whether the trustees had given adequate legal notice and a chance for public comments by officials and parents in the Albany school district. Because charter schools draw their money from local school districts, those districts are entitled by law to have a voice in the process.</p>
        <p>The SUNY trustees, who are appointed by Mr. Pataki, voted again in July to approve the school, but in August the Regents raised objections, questioning whether the school's temporary quarters in trailers were adequate and expressing concern that the school, with an annual budget of about $4 million, would draw too much money out of the Albany public school system. Because of political compromises that forged the charter school law, the Regents cannot block a SUNY-approved school from opening, but they have do have advisory powers.</p>
        <p>Steven F. Wilson, the chief executive of Advantage Schools, said inadequate facilities were among the primary problems with the school. ''We knew our program couldn't successfully operate'' in the portable classrooms, Mr. Wilson said. In its application, the school's sponsors, including Mr. Dare, said that a new, permanent site would be ready in mid-February of this year.</p>
        <p>By then, however, the Urban League was having financial difficulties that were beginning to weigh on New Covenant's operations. The school leased its temporary space from a for-profit subsidiary of the Urban League known as the Commons, and last year, the Commons was also in financial trouble. It had made a $2 million loan to a financial company for which it was constructing an office building, but in December, that company collapsed and was unable to pay back the loan. At the same time, an Albany construction company that had performed work on the trailers being used by the school was demanding payment.</p>
        <p>According to an inquiry conducted for the SUNY trustees by Richard J. Bartlett, a lawyer in Glens Falls, N.Y., $89,000 in state education money that was supposed to be paid to Advantage was instead forwarded to the Albany construction company by Mr. Dare in December, on behalf of the Commons. Mr. Bartlett said the act violated Mr. Dare's financial responsibilities to the school.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bartlett wrote in his report that while Mr. Dare's actions did not ''rise to the level of criminal conduct,'' Mr. Dare should resign from the school's board. Mr. Dare said yesterday that his departure was not related to Mr. Bartlett's report.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Dare's resignation, several other directors also resigned, and the school's board members have been substantially replaced.</p>
        <p>Willard Washburn, co-chairman of the board, said that Mr. Pataki's office expressed interest in New Covenant and Advantage throughout last year. Top Advantage officials and Mr. Dare had first talked about establishing the charter school after being introduced to each other by Lisa O'Brien, an Advantage executive at the time who had previously worked as a midlevel aide in the Pataki administration. In an interview, Mrs. O'Brien, who now heads a charter school trade group, said her work for the Pataki administration was coincidental to Advantage's selection as the operator of the school.</p>
        <p>If New Covenant's charter amendment is acted upon by the SUNY trustees in the next three weeks, the Regents can perhaps clear the way for the school to open late next month.</p>
        <p>Edison has pledged more than $3 million toward the construction of a $10 million building for the school.</p>
        <p>Others have expressed less certainty about whether the school can open in the fall. Among the Education Department's concerns was the performance of the school's fourth graders on the state's English test. Only 9 percent of New Covenant students met or exceeded the state standard, among the worst performances of any school.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Sanders of the education committee said he believed that New Covenant's failures could be traced back to the accelerated approval process. ''The failure, in my judgment, was in SUNY and the governor trying to accelerate the approval process when it really needed more time,'' he said. ''The results speak for themselves.''</p>
