        <p>Though the hero of ''Sheep in the Big City'' is a sheep named Sheep, there is nothing generic about this sly, mordant new series, which will have a preview on the Cartoon Network tonight at 9. (It will begin for real in November.) The show's model is unmistakably ''Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' with its hilariously puffed-up storytelling voice, several cliff-hanging episodes in each half-hour installment, puns and most of all a humor that is silly enough to appeal to children and satiric enough for adults.</p>
        <p>But ''Sheep in the Big City'' has its own look and feel. The brightly colored characters have faces that are sometimes as askew as those in a Cubist portrait, a reflection of the show's cockeyed yet astute view of the world.</p>

        <p>Though the hero of ''Sheep in the Big City'' is a sheep named Sheep, there is nothing generic about this sly, mordant new series, which will have a preview on the Cartoon Network tonight at 9. (It will begin for real in November.) The show's model is unmistakably ''Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' with its hilariously puffed-up storytelling voice, several cliff-hanging episodes in each half-hour installment, puns and most of all a humor that is silly enough to appeal to children and satiric enough for adults.</p>
        <p>But ''Sheep in the Big City'' has its own look and feel. The brightly colored characters have faces that are sometimes as askew as those in a Cubist portrait, a reflection of the show's cockeyed yet astute view of the world.</p>
        <p>The first brief episode is not the most engaging. The mute yet perfectly communicating Sheep is abducted from his home at Farmer Brown's by an evil military group that needs him as ammunition for its secret weapon. Things pick up instantly when Sheep escapes in the city and has to evade the villainous General Specific and his cohorts, General Dentistry and General Interest. Farmer Brown, a man who has had way too much therapy, arrives and walks the city street calling out in a sing-sing voice: ''Shee-eep! Where are you? I need clo-sure.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Sheep is doing just fine, getting money from an A.T.M.. Don't ask how he earns it (innocently) or why Farmer Brown thinks Sheep has become a cross-dresser; those are big-city surprises.</p>
        <p>It is no surprise that Sheep will make it in the city and go on to fresh adventures. The preview ends, after all, with him tossing his fleece in the air, evoking the hat toss at the end of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and signaling a happy future for this series.</p>
