        <p>Re ''A New Surge in Violence Kills 16 in Embattled Kashmir'' (news article, Aug. 14): It was evident from the start that last month's offer of a three-month unilateral cease-fire by the largest of the Muslim rebel groups in Kashmir, the Hizbul Mujahedeen, was a sham.</p>
        <p>When Hizbul's call for ''unconditional'' negotiations was accepted by the Indian government, two caveats were then quickly attached to the offer: that India must negotiate outside the framework of the Indian Constitution, which prohibits permitting Kashmir's secession from India, and that Pakistan must be included in the talks.</p>

        <p>India has long maintained that it would do neither. Its refusal to do so now should not be construed as intransigence. The militants and their Pakistani backers should realize that the costs of war in Kashmir are too high to play with the prospects of peace.</p>
