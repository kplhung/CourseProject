        <p>The big Netherlands-based banking group ABN Amro Holding N.V. reported a 13 percent gain in first-half earnings, to 1.63 billion euros, or $1.5 billion, although increased costs, notably for employee bonuses in investment banking, offset gains in fees and commissions. While commission income rose 45 percent, to 3 billion euros, thanks to strong global stock markets, and overall revenue rose 20 percent, to 9.2 billion euros, operating expenses rose 24 percent. Rijkman Groenink, who became chief executive in May, said ABN would take a one-time charge this year of 800 million euros for a reorganization.</p>
