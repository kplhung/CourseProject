        <p>Only a diehard fan of the long-running Japanese ''Godzilla'' series could love ''Godzilla 2000,'' the 23rd screen appearance of the indestructible fire-breathing monster that emerges from the sea to wreak awesome destruction. This is not to say that there aren't thousands (perhaps even millions) of cultists who won't adore it. Watching this transcendentally tacky movie, which wants us to laugh at it and with it at the same time, it is easy to see why the series threatens to be as enduring as its namesake.</p>
        <p>The Japanese version, as opposed to Roland Emmerich's pretentious, clanking Hollywood update of a few years back, takes a more philosophical view of Godzilla. Is the monster a super-clumsy lumbering friend of mankind? Or is he our enemy? Or is he both? Might his longevity owe itself to the fact that he is really ourselves in a different form? Ah, who knows what evil lurks?</p>

        <p>Only a diehard fan of the long-running Japanese ''Godzilla'' series could love ''Godzilla 2000,'' the 23rd screen appearance of the indestructible fire-breathing monster that emerges from the sea to wreak awesome destruction. This is not to say that there aren't thousands (perhaps even millions) of cultists who won't adore it. Watching this transcendentally tacky movie, which wants us to laugh at it and with it at the same time, it is easy to see why the series threatens to be as enduring as its namesake.</p>
        <p>The Japanese version, as opposed to Roland Emmerich's pretentious, clanking Hollywood update of a few years back, takes a more philosophical view of Godzilla. Is the monster a super-clumsy lumbering friend of mankind? Or is he our enemy? Or is he both? Might his longevity owe itself to the fact that he is really ourselves in a different form? Ah, who knows what evil lurks?</p>
        <p>The beast's latest resurrection, directed by Takao Okawara, has been scaled back from 328 feet (his height from 1991 through 1995), to 170 feet, which is close to his original size. (From 1954 to 1975, the production notes inform us, Godzilla was 164 feet.) Such things matter to cult audiences.</p>
        <p>What really hasn't changed radically in 46 years is the series' 1950's-style comic book pacing and dialogue. The movie wastes no time cutting to the chase. In the first five minutes, Godzilla destroys a submarine and a seaside restaurant. By the end of the film, most of Tokyo lies smoking at his feet. Unlike the Hollywood version, ''Godzilla 2000'' doesn't try too terribly hard for realism. The structures that are toppled and snapped like match sticks look like toys.</p>
        <p>Compounding the fun is the awfulness of dialogue that has been hilariously (and badly) dubbed into English and is always spoken in the semi-robotic, gee-whiz tones of Saturday morning cartoons. It reaches a peak of silliness when one startled character actually exclaims, ''Great Caesar's ghost!''</p>
        <p>''Godzilla 2000'' has enough story to fill three movies. The fable basically pits the good guys (those who want to study Godzilla and learn from him) against the baddies (those determined to destroy Godzilla as quickly as possible and who are willing to sacrifice human lives to get the dirty deed done).</p>
        <p>This time, the debate over Godzilla's fate is complicated by the discovery of what at first seems to be a  meteorite on the bottom of the ocean. It metamorphoses into a flying rock and then a U.F.O. with designs on taking over the Earth. Ultimately, Godzilla goes literally head to head (and in one scene head in mouth) with a Godzilla-like monster the aliens have conjured up on the smoking ruins of what used to be Tokyo.</p>
        <p>Beyond being an obvious fable about nuclear power in the computer age, none of this adds up unless you are determined to force every square peg into every round hole and  pretend they fit. The most ardent fans, no doubt, will be able to piece together an allegorical puzzle.</p>
        <p>''Godzilla 2000'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes scenes of violence and destruction that could upset young children.</p>
        <p>GODZILLA 2000</p>

Running time: 90 minutes. This film is rated PG.</p>
