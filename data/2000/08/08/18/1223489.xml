        <p>Corning Inc. said yesterday that it would build an $80 million plant in the Rochester suburb of Henrietta, N.Y., that would produce components for fiber optic communication networks.</p>
        <p>The plant, to be built in an existing factory, is expected to create 440  jobs, the company said. The announcement comes several weeks after Corning said it would spend $50 million to expand a similar three-year-old plant it operates in Erwin, N.Y., a step that a Corning spokesman, Dan Collins, said would add 700 jobs to the 1,500 there. The company is also building a third similar plant  in Scranton, Pa.</p>

        <p>Corning Inc. said yesterday that it would build an $80 million plant in the Rochester suburb of Henrietta, N.Y., that would produce components for fiber optic communication networks.</p>
        <p>The plant, to be built in an existing factory, is expected to create 440  jobs, the company said. The announcement comes several weeks after Corning said it would spend $50 million to expand a similar three-year-old plant it operates in Erwin, N.Y., a step that a Corning spokesman, Dan Collins, said would add 700 jobs to the 1,500 there. The company is also building a third similar plant  in Scranton, Pa.</p>
        <p>The state's Empire State Development Corporation is to provide Corning with a $4.3 million grant toward the $80 million cost, and the company is eligible for $10 million more in the form of state tax breaks. Charles A. Gargano, the agency's chairman, said that the aid package persuaded Corning to build in the state rather than at a site in Georgia, which the company was considering.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collins said that production would begin early next year at the Henrietta site, which will make items that amplify the electronic signal used in fiber optic communication systems.</p>
