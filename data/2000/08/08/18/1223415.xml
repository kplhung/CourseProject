        <p>MANHATTAN: CHARGES DROPPED IN CONCRETE ATTACK  A Manhattan judge yesterday formally dropped charges against Bently Louis Grant, 35, a homeless man charged with attacking a woman last month with a chunk of concrete. The police had said that Mr. Grant confessed. Security videotapes, however, showed that he was at a Manhattan record store at the time of the attack. On Wednesday, Mr. Grant, who has been treated for mental illness, was moved to an apartment with the help of psychiatric social workers at Elmhurst Medical Center, where he received care after being released from jail.

        <p>UNIONDALE: UTILITY TO EXPAND POWER DISTRIBUTION  The Long Island Power Authority asked for proposals from potential suppliers yesterday for one or more cables beneath Long Island Sound, each capable of carrying 200 to 600 megawatts of electricity to Long Island by as early as May 2003. The authority chairman, Richard M. Kessel, said the power would meet rising demand from 1.1 million customers on Long Island and the Rockaway Peninsula.</p>

        <p>MINEOLA: PROPERTY TAX STUDY  The Nassau County Board of Assessors unanimously selected a firm yesterday to reassess the value of every property in the county. The firm, Cole-Layer-Trumble Company of Dayton, Ohio, must be approved by the County Legislature before it can start work. Critics have said that the Nassau property tax system uses construction prices from 1938 and that land values are based on prices from 1964. Poor communities are typically overtaxed under this system, critics say. The cash-strapped county has paid millions of dollars to taxpayers who have successfully challenged their tax assessments.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: HUMAN REMAINS FOUND  A blue Samsonite suitcase packed with human body parts was found floating in the Hudson River near Battery Park yesterday afternoon, about 13 hours after a plastic bag containing human limbs was caught on the hull of a Consolidated Edison barge in the East River near 14th Street, the police said. Both sets of body parts appeared to be from the same black or Hispanic woman, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner said.  Elissa Gootman (NYT)</p>
        <p>ALBANY: PATAKI SIGNS CIGARETTE BILL  A measure that could make New York the first state to require that all cigarettes be self-extinguishing was signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday. The legislation is intended to reduce the number of fires that occur when smokers fall asleep or otherwise handle a cigarette carelessly. By mid-2003, all cigarettes sold in New York must be made to go out if no puffs are taken for a while. The governor said the law would prevent needless tragedies.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN  The jobless rate in New York City edged down last month to 5.5 percent, from 5.6 in June and 6.8 percent a year ago, according to the New York State Department of Labor. For the state as a whole, unemployment fell to 4.2 percent, the lowest since 1988. Both state and local unemployment rates remain above the national level of 4 percent; upstate, the rate has fallen to 3.5 percent, from 3.7 last month and 4.2 percent a year ago.</p>

        <p>WHITE PLAINS: PRISON GUARD RECRUITMENT  The New York Department of Correctional Services is recruiting prison guards, in part because of prison expansion but also because of the possibility of a larger than average number of retirements in the near future. There are currently 20,500 guards, who oversee 71,000 inmates and earn an average salary of $35,000 a year. A new maximum security prison, the Five Points Correctional Facility, is to open this month in Romulus, N.Y., and other prisons are being expanded. No specific number of new hires has been given.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: DRUG RING ARRESTS  Authorities said yesterday that they had arrested the leader and other members of a marijuana smuggling ring that used exotic dancers as couriers to move as much as 400 pounds of marijuana through Kennedy International Airport each week. The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said the dancers and others were given round-trip airline tickets and $1,000 each to fly to California and smuggle the marijuana into New York in their suitcases. Six people were arrested between Wednesday night and yesterday morning, with other members of the ring arrested over the last few months, Mr. Brown said.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: TAX-FREE WEEK  Connecticut's first week without the 6 percent sales tax for clothing and shoes costing less than $300 is to begin on Sunday. State Representative Robert M. Ward, who lobbied the General Assembly for a no-tax week, modeled on the one in New York, said the program would save consumers about $3 million.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: PLOT AGAINST PROSECUTOR  An imprisoned sex offender and his brother were charged in connection with a plot to kill a Windham state's attorney. The prisoner, Richard Straub, 64, is serving a 15-year term for using his position as a probation officer to force young men in his custody to have sex with him. He was arraigned Wednesday on charges of attempted murder, bribery, and conspiracy to escape from the Cheshire Correctional Center. The police had discovered he twice tried to hire someone to murder the lawyer, Mark Solak, who prosecuted his case in 1999. Roland Straub, 60, was charged with bribery and helping his brother try to escape.</p>

        <p>LAKEHURST: CRASH MEMORIAL  More than 2,000 people gathered in the gymnasium of the Naval Air Engineering Station yesterday for a memorial for the 11 people who died Aug. 9 when two small planes collided over a subdivision in Burlington County. Six victims worked at the base and were taking a shuttle flight to headquarters in Maryland when it crashed into a plane carrying an aviation instructor and his student. As mourners sang ''Amazing Grace'' and placed carnations in front of photographs of the dead, a naval brigade fired a 21-gun salute, and a bugler played ''Taps.''  Andrew Jacobs (NYT)</p>
