        <p>The five dozen delegates from Iowa had just finished breakfast today when the North Carolina senator, dressed in blue suit and black cowboy boots, strode confidently into their meeting room.</p>
        <p>The senator, John Edwards, had come to praise Vice President Al Gore, but he managed to squeeze in a few words about himself, too. How the ''struggling farmers'' of Iowa reminded him of the struggling farmers of North Carolina, for instance. And how, as a trial lawyer, he once fought an insurance company on behalf of a boy who had been denied coverage.</p>
        <p>The delegates hooted and cheered for the brief but fiery speech. And as Mr. Edwards turned to the door, the state Democratic chairman, Rob Tully, pulled him aside, saying, ''I think we'll see a lot of you.''</p>
        <p>It was a not-so-subtle reminder that the the presidential primary season kicks off in Iowa.</p>
        <p>Election Day 2000 is not yet upon us, but the beauty pageant for 2004 and beyond is already under way, judging from the parade of prospects who have visited the Iowa delegation this week.</p>
        <p>Few people at the Democratic National Convention here will say that they expect Mr. Gore to lose this year -- but plenty are preparing for the day he departs the national scene. And so this year, as in any other convention year, the party's would-be rising stars are strutting their wares, meeting the Democratic cognoscenti, raising some money and laying the groundwork for future campaigns.</p>
        <p>''That's politics,'' Mr. Tully observed. ''In case the world comes to an end, and Al Gore and Joe Lieberman aren't elected, there will be people already working to fill the void.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Edwards, 47, a first-term senator who gained national attention when Mr. Gore put him on his short list of potential running mates, logged a schedule this week of someone with plans to make plans for a national campaign. He made speeches to the delegations from Massachusetts, New York and California, a prime-time appearance on the convention stage, several appearances on national talk shows, and gave scores of news media interviews.</p>
        <p>He was far from alone. Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Evan Bayh of Indiana, Govs. Gray Davis of California and Tom Vilsack of Iowa and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, all had busy, high-profile weeks here. And all are considered potential presidential contenders.</p>
        <p>The jockeying has already begun among the party's noisy factions to promote their favorites. Labor leaders talk up Mr. Gephardt. Former  Senator Bill Bradley's supporters want him to give it another go. Moderates promote Mr. Bayh. And liberals say they would love to see Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Gephardt or Hillary Rodham Clinton -- who is still seeking her first elected office, senator from New York -- run for the White House.</p>
        <p>''If this ticket goes down, I think progressives are going to be pretty determined to have a horse in the field next time around,'' said Robert Borosage, co-director of Campaign for America's Future, a nonprofit group that promotes liberal ideas.</p>
        <p>Many Democrats have complained that their bench seems rather thin. By comparison, the Republicans had a deep pool of well-known, highly experienced governors who could have been the running mate for their nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. (That said, Mr. Bush chose a former congressman and defense secretary, Dick Cheney.)</p>
        <p>But other Democrats note that in 1996, when the Republican Party seemed in desperate need of new blood, Governor Bush was just mid-way through his first term and barely registering on most people's political radar screens.</p>
        <p>Among Iowa Democrats, there are widespread hopes that Mr. Vilsack will emerge, Bushlike, from the pack. An obscure state senator when he was elected governor in 1998, Mr. Vilsack offers what many Midwestern Democrats think their party needs more of: a folksy, earnest style coupled with a populist agenda.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vilsack, 49, put some of those assets on view today when he spoke before members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. After getting bumped down the speakers' list by more prominent Democrats, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Mr. Vilsack muttered, ''I'm batting eighth in an all-star lineup here.''</p>
        <p>But he brought the crowd to its feet with a story about how a union member had given him a $100 campaign contribution out of her tiny savings.</p>
        <p>In separate interviews, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Vilsack brushed aside suggestions that they might be thinking ahead to national campaigns. But they did not exactly close the door to the idea, either.</p>
        <p>''It's interesting to watch all these people maneuvering and thinking about the future,'' Mr. Vilsack said. I'm just going to work hard, which is what I've always done. I'm a fighter. And if it works out, something comes up in the future, then we'll go after it.''</p>
