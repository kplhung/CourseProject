        <p>Just days before the United States women's tennis team was made public in early August, Coach Billie Jean King called Lisa Raymond, the No. 1 ranked doubles player in the world at the time, to tell her she would not be going to Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Raymond was in disbelief.</p>
        <p>In the past, the Olympic team was made up of the top three ranked American women, plus the top-ranked doubles player available.</p>
        <p>Instead, Serena Williams, who had no ranking as a doubles player by the cut-off date of July 10, was chosen to join Lindsay Davenport, Monica Seles and Serena's sister, Venus.</p>
        <p>''I could have thought, 'O.K., this is no big deal,' '' Raymond said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''But then I thought, I don't want to sit by and let this happen. It's not in my personality to be confrontational, but I had to do something.''</p>
        <p>Raymond filed a grievance against the United States Tennis Association and is preparing for an arbitration hearing scheduled for Monday in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Raymond's lawyer, Gregory Becker, will argue that the U.S.T.A. failed to follow the rules for Olympic team selection and violated the United States Olympic Committee's guidelines by using discretion when picking the team.</p>
        <p>Officials from the U.S.T.A. declined to comment on Raymond's grievance until the matter is resolved. But according to the criteria the U.S.T.A. submitted to the U.S.O.C., the selection of the team was based on the top four ranked American players, but it did not differentiate between singles and doubles rankings.</p>
        <p>''The precedents that have been set will fill out any ambiguity,'' said Becker, who cited the example of Gigi Fernandez's selection to play in the 1992 and 1996 Olympics based on her ranking in doubles. ''The U.S.T.A. failed to follow the approved rules by the U.S.O.C. The selection system does not allow for discretion.''</p>
        <p>The semantics of the rules aside, there was obvious pressure on the U.S.T.A. to put Serena Williams on the team. During her Wimbledon run to the title, Venus Williams indicated that she would be reluctant to play for the Olympic team if her sister was not chosen to play doubles.</p>
        <p>A decision from the arbitrator is expected within 48 hours of the hearing and cannot be appealed.</p>
