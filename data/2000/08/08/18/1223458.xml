        <p>Can political star power be measured by parking lot rates? If so, Al Gore may have reason to worry.</p>
        <p>One of the outdoor parking lots closest to the convention has altered its rates on a daily basis. On the day President Clinton spoke, the lot charged $25. The Joseph I. Lieberman night resulted in a discounted parking rate of $15. Today, the biggest and final day of the convention, when the presidential candidate, Al Gore, spoke to the delegates, parking lot rates tumbled. All-day parking cost only $5.</p>
        <p>Doing the Hokey Hokey</p>
        <p>It was an hour before the biggest speech of Al Gore's life. The packed Democratic National Convention was pulsing with energy. The crowd waited. But then the convention's planners began an Oprah-style tribute to Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>And no one listened.</p>
        <p>The stage presentation featured among others David Halberstam, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who talked about Mr. Gore's family and The Tennessean, the newspaper where both he and Mr. Gore once worked. There were also tributes to Mr. Gore as a mountaineer, a man of religion, a soldier, a friend.</p>
        <p>The tribute was designed to depict Mr. Gore as warm, gutsy and accessible. But it went on and on.</p>
        <p>And on.</p>
        <p>''I didn't hear it,'' said Senator.  Charles E. Schumer of New York.</p>
        <p>''I didn't hear it,'' said Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the New York State Assembly.</p>
        <p>''I didn't really listen to it,'' said Christine Quinn, a New York City councilwoman.</p>
        <p>''Sure it's hokey,'' said Jaynne Keyes, a former New York City film commissioner. ''But three-fourths of America is hokey, and proud of it.''</p>
        <p>Big Guy in Gore's Shadow</p>
        <p>Now that Al Gore is the Democratic Party's new leading man, what happens to the big guy still on stage in the White House? At a raucous reunion party late Wednesday in West Hollywood for past and present Clinton staffers, Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said that the president would be out fund-raising for Mr. Gore ''a couple of times a week'' between now and the election.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Mr. Clinton's role in the Gore campaign is undecided -- and a big source of debate here. Will Mr. Clinton's presence on the campaign trail strengthen Mr. Gore, or dwarf him? ''The president can raise money and raise issues, but otherwise he ought not to be out there campaigning,'' said Paul Begala, the former Clinton adviser, who turned up at the party at Manhattan Wonton Company, a restaurant on Melrose Place. ''He would tend to distract and overshadow.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart said Mr. Clinton would do whatever the Gore campaign wanted, which, a Gore adviser said, will be trips to the South, to black communities and to California -- places where he is popular. Mr. Clinton is also speaking nearly every day to his old friend, William Daley, the Gore-Lieberman campaign manager. Offering political advice, yes? Mr. Lockhart wouldn't say, but Mr. Begala, a veteran of the 1992 Clinton campaign offered this: ''In 1992 there was always a creative tension between the people who were hired to run the campaign and the person who wanted to run the campaign.''</p>
        <p>New Kosher Kid on the Block</p>
        <p>Kosher food for the Liebermans? No issue, said Wolfgang Puck, the premier chef of Los Angeles, who has catered dozens of convention parties in the last few days. Mr. Puck said he had not yet specifically made dinner for Mr. Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, who keep kosher. ''But,'' he said, ''there's no difficulty at all -- I cook for a lot of customers who have kosher homes and they eat some white fish, some vegetables, some fruit. They don't eat butter and cream with meat. You avoid these.''</p>
        <p>Some Orthodox Jews, like the Liebermans, either avoid restaurants at any cost, or even bring their own plates out of concern that restaurant dishes, however clean, had been used in the past for nonkosher food. But the Connecticut Democrat has eaten at numerous receptions here and dines at trendy places in Washington, like I Ricci. One of his friends said, ''He eats salad and fish -- no big deal. He has bread. And he's a stickler for kosher wine -- that's  what he drinks when he has wine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Puck, owner of Spago and other restaurants, said jokingly that while providing food for the Liebermans would pose no difficulties, the hungry delegates were another matter. ''They like to eat, they really like to eat, much more than people do in L.A.,'' he said. ''In L.A., with the movie people, they take a little food, a little mineral water, sometimes a glass of champagne. But these delegates are something else. They enjoy their food! I like that. We had a dinner the other night at Spago. Eight hundred were supposed to show. Well, 1,800 showed. I was shocked. They kept coming and they kept eating.''</p>
        <p>G.O.P. Spin Squad</p>
        <p>Republicans? At the Democratic convention?</p>
        <p>''We felt like the people who were entering 'Checkpoint Charlie,' it's kind of like going into East Germany,'' said Rick Wilson, a consultant to the Republican National Committee who has been in town for the last week with a half-dozen members of the G.O.P. shmoozing the press at the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>Were the Republicans spinning the news? ''I prefer to call it 'rapid response,' '' Mr. Wilson said.</p>
        <p>The Republican spinners included Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, Representative Henry Bonilla of Texas, Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Pat Harrison, co-chairman. The group operated from a small suite opposite the Staples Center, and fanned out each day, sometimes wearing press passes, walking the corridors and talking to journalists and radio correspondents about the Democrats' inadequacies.</p>
        <p>At the Republican convention in Philadelphia, the Democrats had a similar squad, but their members were sometimes harder to spot. The Republican group here wore pins reading: ''Bush/Cheney.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Harrison said the week passed perfectly pleasantly for the interlopers. ''Actually we were treated kind of well by the Democrats,'' Ms. Harrison said, sounding a bit puzzled.</p>
        <p>Pity the Poor Millionaire</p>
        <p>One-two-three. Everyone. Let's all feel sorry for the millionaires of the Democratic Party. While billionaires like Eli Broad, one of the Democrats' most generous patrons, seem to have no complaints about how the party is falling all over itself massaging V.I.P's, the lesser contributors are another matter. Lesser means those who have given only, say, $100,000.</p>
        <p>As rich as these donors are, the red carpet is looking a bit frayed to them. The computers were down when they checked into the five-star Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, their parking passes and convention center credentials were not ready, their convention skyboxes had been commandeered by Democratic officials and their parties, which they initially assumed would be exclusive affairs, turned out to be grossly oversubscribed and seemed, at times, like the I.R.T. at rush hour in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>One party fund-raiser heard a torrent of complaints from one big donor and suggested that the unhappy millionaire speak to the party leadership. ''He said to me, 'who am I going to complain to? This whole thing is being run by a bunch of 23-year-old kids.' ''</p>
        <p>One-two-three. Everyone. Let's all feel sorry . . .</p>
