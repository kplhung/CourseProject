        <p>Demonstrating some of the political dexterity that has kept him in public office for 30 years, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman tried today to rally support from leaders of his party's liberal wing and then a few hours later had lunch with fellow members of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council.</p>
        <p>Each group greeted him with hugs and kisses all around.</p>
        <p>''A love-fest'' is how Mr. Lieberman's campaign manager, Thomas R. Nides, described the sessions, shaking his head in wonderment at Mr. Lieberman's appeal.</p>
        <p>Thus, in only a few hours, Mr. Lieberman gave a glimpse of what will be one of his major goals in the critical weeks of campaigning to come: reassuring the party's liberal base while keeping faith with his moderate allies in the Democratic Leadership Council, of which he is the chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman began his day by meeting with leaders of labor groups, teachers unions and women's groups. In the morning sessions, he spoke of fighting for working families, of breaking down econcomic barriers for all groups. At lunch, he spoke the language of the centrist New Democrats, talking about the virtues of personal responsibility, for example, and describing government as a catalyst for social improvement, but no more.</p>
        <p>With his willingness to tailor his political messages to different audiences, Mr. Leiberman displayed a competitive streak somewhat at odds with his reputation as the conscience of the United States Senate, as a politician who speaks his mind without regard to the consequences.</p>
        <p>''We didn't come to play, we came to win,'' Mr. Lieberman told the Democratic Leadership Coucnil, adding, ''I'm from the Vinnie Lombardi school. Winning is the whole deal.''</p>
        <p>In his morning meetings, Mr. Lieberman continued what has been a weeklong effort to persuade the party's liberal base that he will be a loyal soldier to Al Gore, who is markedly left of Mr. Lieberman on several issues that are of deep importance to the liberal wing.</p>
        <p>For example, in meeting with education leaders, including representatives from the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, Mr. Lieberman made clear that he continued to support experimental programs of providing low-income parents with vouchers to help pay for their children to attend private schools.</p>
        <p>Many education leaders bitterly oppose vouchers, and Mr. Gore himself has called them a threat to the nation's system of public schools. Mr. Lieberman told the leaders that while he would not hesitate to share his views with Mr. Gore in private, he would firmly support Mr. Gore's ultimate policy positions.</p>
        <p>And so, as he has all week, Mr. Lieberman focused this morning on areas of agreement while playing down some of his more conservative views.</p>
