        <p>Well, it appears the Kennedy magic has fizzled.

        <p>And what, you may ask, have we learned from the Democratic convention?</p>
        <p>Well, it appears the Kennedy magic has fizzled. Ted Kennedy, one of the few surviving politicians to whom the word ''bellowing'' is relevant, has become a commodity best reserved for off-screen appearances. Seeing Caroline was nice, but the next-generation gene pool seems to be getting shallow.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats did not feel compelled to keep their Congressional delegation locked up. In fact, if you are represented by a Democratic member of the House who was not on television sometime during this week's activities, he or she either has a very safe district or a party scheduled for the Playboy mansion.</p>
        <p>But for the most part, the convention was all about Al Gore, and a lot like a birthday party being thrown by an anxious family for a kid who isn't particularly popular. The parents keep inserting themselves into the action, joshing nervously and trying to create the impression that all the fun is emanating from the rather lumpish guest of honor.</p>
        <p>This was a convention in which the presidential nominating speech focused on a story about how at Harvard, Mr. Gore once roasted a turkey in the dorm fireplace.</p>
        <p>''We watched 'Star Trek' when maybe we should have been studying,'' Tommy Lee Jones assured the nation. The actor, who was Mr. Gore's roommate at Harvard, was part of a cast of thousands who marched onstage to hammer home the idea that the vice president is actually the life of the party.</p>
        <p>Last night Tipper Gore did everything but turn cartwheels to get the auditorium revved up on her husband's behalf, and the crowd practically levitated when he came into the auditorium. But by the time he got to ''the private sector, the engine that drives economic growth,'' you knew he was never going to master the trick of creating a sense of intimacy within a huge arena. He delivered a speech that was true to himself: serious, partisan, issue-driven, estimable, but no walk in the park.</p>
        <p>The curse of Al Gore's life is that he appears insincere, even when his heart is totally in it. We keep trying to find reasons for this in his upbringing, or his ambition, but perhaps the bottom line is that what we've got here is a perfectly O.K. person who's been cursed by fate with an unwinning smile and a tin ear that flattens out his speech.</p>
        <p>The convention also saw a 13-minute video about Mr. Gore's lighter side that was directed by Spike Jonze, of ''Being John Malkovich'' fame. Try to catch it if you get a chance -- this may be your only opportunity to see the candidate body-surfing, showing off the gas masks the security guys make him carry in the car, and cheerfully pointing out a nude self-portrait of his wife.</p>
        <p>The film does make Mr. Gore seem like a guy who's fun to be around, but you can't help noticing the amount of heavy lifting Tipper and the girls have to do to get him there. The vice president is good at playing the straight man, protesting mildly while his children make fun of the way he overmanages the family TV viewing. (When a video is on, Mr. Gore apparently stops the action whenever anybody leaves the room, and rewinds back to the F.B.I. warning when the lost sheep returns.) However, the real message you get is that it might be amusing to hang out with Karenna.</p>
        <p>Actually, Mr. Gore does have a sense of humor, but it's very dry. This year the Democratic ticket is carrying around a whole lot of wit that's on the arid side. If the American public ever puts out a call for irony, these guys are ready.</p>
        <p>The public's Gore aversion may be nothing more than a sense that the current team in the White House is like a TV series that's run its course. Even ''M*A*S*H'' got canceled eventually. ''Home Improvement'' ran out of steam after eight years, and the people on that were less stressful company than this administration.</p>
        <p>The whole point of the last four days was to prepare the American mind for the spinoff, to make people realize that Bill Clinton may be  ''Happy Days'' in its final season, but Al Gore is the first episode of  ''Joanie Loves Chachie.''</p>
        <p>Or maybe not exactly.</p>
