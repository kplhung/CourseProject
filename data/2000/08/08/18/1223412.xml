        <p>The New Jersey Supreme Court, in striking down a state parental notification requirement for minors seeking abortion, has followed the court's longstanding tradition of interpreting the New Jersey State Constitution in a manner broadly protective of fundamental privacy rights.</p>
        <p>The parental notification statute was signed into law by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman last year in the face of bitter opposition from abortion rights advocates. This enlightened rejection of that law came from a court dominated by six Whitman appointees, which applied in straightforward fashion the legal precedents developed under New Jersey constitutional law.</p>
        <p>The statute required a doctor to wait 48 hours after written notice had been given to the parent of a minor before performing an abortion. Notice was not required in cases of medical emergency or if a minor got a waiver from a judge. About 40 states have enacted laws that require parental notification or consent in a minor's abortion decision. The United States Supreme Court has upheld state parental notification requirements on due process grounds provided there are adequate provisions for judicial waivers.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey court has long maintained that the State Constitution gives women greater protection in abortion rights than the federal Constitution. In this case the court found that the notification requirement violated equal protection by imposing a burden on minors seeking abortions but not on minors seeking other medical and surgical care during their pregnancies.</p>
        <p>The court pointed out that state law did not, for example, require parental notification for a minor getting a caesarean section to deliver a baby, which is more invasive than abortion. It also observed that  notification would probably delay the abortion, and in many cases deter teenagers from obtaining abortions at all. The court said that a judicial waiver was not a cure for this constitutional flaw because it merely imposed an additional procedural burden on young women who may be unable to communicate with their parents. No legal mandate can heal broken lines of communication between a parent and child, and no amendment to the statute is likely to correct its unconstitutionality.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Deborah Poritz wrote in the majority opinion that ''a minor's right to control her reproductive decisions is among the most fundamental of the rights she possesses.'' This court's decision protects the right of young women to make the most intimate choice of whether to carry a child to term.</p>
