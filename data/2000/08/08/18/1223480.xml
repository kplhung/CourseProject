        <p>If Bill Clinton's backstage walk to valediction on Monday was a heavyweight champion's last indulgent moment in the sun, Al Gore's arrival in the Staples Center tonight was a dogged contender's first chance to enter the arena alone. He strode through a sea of pennants down a side aisle with a posse of seconds trailing humbly in his wake.</p>
        <p>By the time Mr. Gore had climbed the gray-carpeted steps of the podium and wrapped his wife, Tipper, in a sweeping embrace and a long kiss, the giant arena was shaking as if struck by a California earthquake, strobe lights were flickering, tears were streaking delegates' faces, and the crowd was utterly his.</p>
        <p>Speaking unusually quickly, confidently, even ebulliently at times, Mr. Gore seemed determined to shake the plodding pace and the tone of condescension that often mark his formal speeches. He virtually raced through a litany of causes and issues dear to core Democratic constituencies, from health care to civil rights, affirmative action, public education, and abortion rights, with perhaps the biggest applause line of all that ''the last thing this country needs is a Supreme Court that overturns Roe v. Wade.''</p>
        <p>After eight years of loyal service to a consummate, intuitive political performer, Mr. Gore left no doubt from the start tonight that he was determined to present himself without Mr. Clinton's shadow darkening his center stage. When he said, ''I stand here tonight as my own man, and I want you to know me for who I truly am,'' his young speechwriter, Eli Attie, and his image-meister, Carter Eskew, watching from just below the podium, slapped a high-five in satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Nearly 50 minutes later, at the end of his speech, Mr. Gore even found his own formulation of Mr. Clinton's 1992 pledge to stay with the voters of New Hampshire until the ''last dog dies,'' by vowing: ''If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be the most exciting politician. But I pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day, and I will never let you down.''</p>
        <p>The contrast with the disappointment that Mr. Clinton's personal conduct has caused Democrats was unspoken but perfectly clear.</p>
        <p>As they climbed the aisles to the press section afterward, Mr. Gore's aides took particular satisfaction at the way he had defined himself and made his argument for election, as when he said: ''This election is not an award for past performance. I'm not asking you to vote for me on the basis of the economy we have. Tonight I ask for your support on the basis of the better, fairer, more prosperous America we can build together.''</p>
        <p>The vice president's aides also expressed surprise that Mr. Gore had finished his speech far faster than in any of his repeated rehearsals with a teleprompter.</p>
        <p>Notably, for a candidate with proven skill at cut-and-thrust, Mr. Gore made not a single direct mention of his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and very few indirect ones.</p>
        <p>About the closest he came to a direct attack was his vow to fight against tax cuts for the wealthy, and fight for prescription drug benefits for the elderly. ''And that's the difference in this election,'' he said. ''They're for the powerful, and we're for the people.''</p>
        <p>This was a convention week in which conventional wisdom held that Mr. Gore needed to knock one out of the park tonight. Only time will tell how he touched the television audience, which matters most, but many  delegates here, perhaps in reflection of the glittery, giddy high of the moment, said he had done just that.</p>
        <p>''Oh, my gosh, I was moved to tears -- I'm so proud of him,'' said Dianna Johnson, a delegate from Virginia who grew up in Tennessee.</p>
        <p>Kevin Whalen, a Massachusetts delegate, said: ''He kept right on the issues, and the issues are what will help him win in November. His style was great. He absolutely was not wooden. As Tiger Woods would say, he brought his A game.''</p>
        <p>Marcia Hale, a longtime Clinton aide who came back this season to help manage the convention for Mr. Gore, flashed a thumbs-up sign as she passed journalists on deadline. ''I think he showed his own persona,'' she said, ''and he told his own story and he said it clearly and with emotion.''</p>
        <p>Afterward, as star-shaped mylar balloons, and red, white and blue rubber ones, and gold and silver confetti fired from air cannons filled the air, the newly minted nominee was  joined on stage by a pantheon of the Democratic family, winners and losers, past and present alike, from his primary rival, former Senator Bill Bradley, to John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. When Mr. Gore finally made his way through the tunnel off the speaker's platform, delegates were straining to shake his hand or snap his picture, and a new aura surrounded him.</p>
        <p>From late afternoon on, the energy in the hall had built steadily. Souvenir stands that were all but deserted on Wednesday suddenly had long lines. Aisles that had been passable were filled to overflowing. Air-conditioning that had been icy seemed just a bit less cold. By 5:30 p.m., the stage was groaning with a gaggle of party leaders and dignitaries.</p>
        <p>By the time Mr. Gore's wife was introduced by their daughter Kristin an hour later, there was pandemonium. Mickey Hart, the old Grateful Dead drummer, beat a tom-tom on stage, and Mrs. Gore, radiant in powder blue, shook and boogied, clapped and high-fived. What seemed like an ocean of round red, white and blue signs reading ''Tipper Rocks'' bobbed in the hall.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gore, an accomplished amateur photographer, narrated pictures from a family album interspersed in a video that paid tribute to Mr. Gore's service in Vietnam, his journalism career and his virtues as a family man. She concluded over stirring music, ''To me, for all the past accomplishments and future promises, he's still the man I fell in love with in high school.''</p>
