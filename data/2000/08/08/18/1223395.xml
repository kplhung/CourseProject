        <p>The arm of a crane at a Manhattan construction site buckled yesterday, sending a one-ton concrete slab crashing to the ground near Union Square, fire officials said. Two people were slightly injured as a result of the accident.</p>
        <p>The boom of the 170-foot red crane at 14th Street and Third Avenue buckled about 1:30 p.m. as it was lifting the slab to the south face of a 15-story New York University dormitory that is under construction, said Assistant Fire Chief Frank Cruthers. The slab landed in the construction area, and one witness said the crash sounded like ''a couple of bread delivery trucks colliding.''</p>
        <p>An electrician was treated for small cuts to his face from flying glass, and a firefighter also suffered minor injuries, Chief Cruthers said.</p>
        <p>''We're extremely grateful that all the injuries seem very, very minor,'' said John H. Beckman, a spokesman for New York University. ''Our second concern, since we stress safety, is to work with all the city agencies to be sure we have an understanding of what happened here and can make certain it never happens again.''</p>
        <p>After the accident, emergency crews quickly lashed the boom to the building. City officials closed off 14th Street from Third Avenue to Irving Place and said they expected to have it open again sometime today. The Police Department and the Buildings Department were investigating, Chief Cruthers said.</p>
        <p>The dormitory is being built on the former site of the Palladium nightclub and the New York Academy of Music. It has been under construction for two years by J. A. Jones-GMO, which is based in Charlotte, N.C. Alex Bergo, director of business development, said the company was investigating the accident. He added that the crane work was subcontracted to Artex Precast, a Toronto company.</p>
        <p>A woman who answered the telephone at Artex said the firm had no comment.</p>
        <p>The accident occurred when the surrounding sidewalks were filled with pedestrians.</p>
        <p>''All we heard was a really loud crash,'' said Wayne Hulse, who was installing carpeting on the ground floor of a building across the street. ''We felt the shake. We looked out the window and saw people scattering. People were running all over the place; they were freaking.''</p>
        <p>He said the crane was swaying slightly right after the accident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beckman said that in March, two construction workers suffered broken bones during an accident involving a hoist.</p>
