        <p>Communications systems based on Internet technology have many strengths, but discernment is not among them. That is because in cyberspace, each digital packet of data is generally treated identically to each of the others; at a company, the chairman's urgent e-mail message may well be delayed as an intern browses the Web for sports scores. Yesterday, however, a small private company, Aplion Networks Inc. introduced the first entrants in a line of products meant to change that. Aplion's first products are meant to sit on the edge of a business customer's network and help set priorities for use of the network. E-mail, for instance, could be given higher priority than Web surfing, for instance, or certain users could be given higher priority than others. Aplion, based in Edison, N.J., hopes that communications providers will buy its systems in an effort to offer more finely tailored data services to business customers.</p>
