        <p>They are your parents' Yankees, Bronx bombers, with a little ''b.'' Only now the left-handed hitter with the swing suited perfectly for Yankee Stadium is David Justice, not Roger Maris. The potent and defensively challenged part-time slugger is not Johnny Blanchard, but Glenallen Hill.</p>
        <p>Throw in Jose Canseco, who came here with 440 career home runs, and suddenly the Yankees' lineup is transformed. Less defense, less speed. Far, far more power.</p>
        <p>The Yankees hit 100 home runs in 83 games before the All-Star Game break, but already have 53 homers in 34 games since then, including homers from Hill, Justice and Luis Sojo last night in a 6-1 thumping of Anaheim at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Denny Neagle (3-3) gave up nine hits in six and two-thirds scoreless innings and snapped his three-game losing streak, helped by three exceptional defensive plays from third baseman Scott Brosius.</p>
        <p>If you project the rate of home runs generated by the Yankees in the last 34 games -- nearly a quarter of the schedule -- over an entire season, they would hit 252 homers, more than the club record of 240 set by the Yankees of Mantle and Maris in 1961.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre said he has not managed a team with more power in five seasons here.</p>
        <p>''No, I don't think so,'' Torre said. ''We had Cecil and Strawberry in '96 -- that was probably the closest to what we have now, with Canseco, Justice and Glenallen Hill.''</p>
        <p>Torre had to figure out ways to cram Cecil Fielder and Darryl Strawberry into his lineup that year, and he's doing the same now. Hill, Justice and Canseco are all most effectively used as designated hitters, and they all were in the starting lineup last night -- Hill in left field, Justice in right field and Canseco as the designated hitter. They have combined for 20 home runs since joining the Yankees, in only 205 at-bats, or about one for every 10 at-bats. Torre does not know exactly how it will work out, trying to find playing time for all of them; the only thing he does know is that so far, it has worked out. The Yankees have averaged nearly a run per game more since they began remaking their lineup with the trade for Justice on June 29.</p>
        <p>''This was a great team before we came here,'' Justice said. ''All of us new guys want to contribute and not hurt the team.''</p>
        <p>They are making it better, each in his own way.</p>
        <p>Playing for the San Francisco Giants in 1997, Hill saw Mark McGwire take swings for the St. Louis Cardinals late that summer and noticed something was different about McGwire's swing. Watching McGwire more closely, Hill realized that McGwire was releasing the bat with his right hand as he waved it through the strike zone.</p>
        <p>The advantage in this, Hill realized, is how it allowed McGwire to have a better angle on his swing. When a right-handed batter swings with a traditional two-handed approach, there is a point when his top hand and wrist -- his right hand -- rolls over the left hand, and this naturally turns the bat head downward.</p>
        <p>By driving the bat with his right hand before releasing it, and using his bottom hand -- his left hand -- to guide and finish the swing, McGwire found he could cover more of the strike zone and maintain his uppercut just a little longer.</p>
        <p>McGwire told Hill it took him years to make the change, but Hill began adopting the new approach, trying to brand the style into his own muscle memory. These days, Hill said, he is caught somewhere in between: sometimes he releases the bat with the top hand, sometimes he doesn't.</p>
        <p>Hill is 35, but his swing is compact and quick and devastating, like a snap of a bullwhip. He can be vulnerable to breaking balls when he is behind in the count, but Torre mentioned last week that if Hill hits a pitch solidly, it will get very small very quickly, disappearing into the distance.</p>
        <p>Anaheim's Kent Mercker tried whipping a low fastball past Hill in the second inning last night, but Hill turned on the ball with his huge 35-ounce bat. It was if he had applied a 3-iron to a golf ball: his drive soared, on a line, just to the right of straightaway center, and when the ball bounded into the black seats -- only the 19th home run hit there in the remodeled Yankee Stadium -- it caromed further back into the rows of seats, like a ball skipping along a fairway. It was his 38th at-bat with the Yankees, and his seventh home run, and it gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead.</p>
        <p>The Angels threatened in almost every inning, but twice sabotaged rallies with base-running mistakes.</p>
        <p>With the Yankees leading, 2-0, Canseco walked leading off the sixth inning; he seems to have been liberated in the Yankees' lineup, feeling free to take bases on balls, rather than swing at bad pitches in an effort to create offense.</p>
        <p>Justice followed. As each pitch is thrown to him, Justice will raise his right leg and jab his foot forward in the air, like a bat-wielding martial artist. It is a timing mechanism for his swing that he did not have when he started his major league career, and Justice cannot remember when he started doing this, or why.</p>
        <p>Justice has always been a pull hitter, but scouts who have followed the Yankees the last month believe that the short right-field stands present a particularly attractive target for him, and think that in certain situations, he will try to turn on pitches and lash them to right.</p>
        <p>The left-hander Juan Alvarez, pitching to Justice, threw a ball inside. Justice lifted and flicked his right foot, turned his hips, swung, and the only thing that prevented the ball from landing in the upper deck was the screen attached to the right-field foul pole.</p>
        <p>Justice has 11 homers with the Yankees, nine in Yankee Stadium, home of the new Bronx bombers.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Struggling to find someone to bat leadoff against right-handed pitchers, Manager JOE TORRE indicated yesterday that he might settle on DEREK JETER -- who usually bats leadoff against lefties -- to bat first all the time, with JORGE POSADA batting second. Jeter went 1 for 2 and walked three times last night. Posada was 2 for 4. Torre has been trying to find a replacement for the regular leadoff hitter, CHUCK KNOBLAUCH, who is rehabilitating his injured right elbow.</p>
