        <p>When you are selling 800 vintage, classic and antique sports cars in one place, you are bound to come across a big party or two.</p>
        <p>Nonstop festivities are planned around the car sales in Pebble Beach, Calif., this weekend, and auction houses, car manufacturers, restoration shops and car clubs expect at least 20,000 people from all over the world. The gathering will be as glamorous as (or more glamorous than) the one at the Democratic National Convention, with entertainment stars, dot-com billionaires and business tycoons in attendance. As Bing Crosby once said of his own golf tournament at Pebble Beach, ''It's going to be a great clambake.''</p>

        <p>When you are selling 800 vintage, classic and antique sports cars in one place, you are bound to come across a big party or two.</p>
        <p>Nonstop festivities are planned around the car sales in Pebble Beach, Calif., this weekend, and auction houses, car manufacturers, restoration shops and car clubs expect at least 20,000 people from all over the world. The gathering will be as glamorous as (or more glamorous than) the one at the Democratic National Convention, with entertainment stars, dot-com billionaires and business tycoons in attendance. As Bing Crosby once said of his own golf tournament at Pebble Beach, ''It's going to be a great clambake.''</p>
        <p>This weekend concludes the Monterey Historics Week, with car rallies, auctions, the Concours d'Elegance (a display, on the golf course, of vintage cars, which are judged according to body design, restoration work and originality), and various  races at a track at nearby Laguna  Seca.</p>
        <p>Miles Morris, the head of Christie's car department in New York, said, ''Winning Pebble Beach is undoubtedly the most prestigious competition in car judging in the world.''</p>
        <p>Car collecting may be changing. Once many people bought elegant vintage cars simply to admire them in their garages. They formed clubs like the Horseless Carriage Club, organized by Los Angeles car enthusiasts in 1937, to swap gossip and restoration tips about cars made before 1916. (The Horseless Carriage Club's Web site is horseless.com.)</p>
        <p>Now, famous car collectors like Jerry Seinfeld, Jay Leno, Ralph Lauren, Nicolas Cage and the cellular communications billionaire Bruce McCaw buy racing cars to drive. ''The vast majority use their cars on the road on a regular basis,'' said Robert Brooks, the founder of the English-based Brooks Auctioneers. Tomorrow Mr. Brooks is to conduct his third annual California sale -- 73 vintage, classic and antique autos -- at the Quail Lodge Resort and Golf Club in Carmel.</p>
        <p>''These are seriously important cars,'' he said. The sale includes Mary Pickford's 1962 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud II saloon, Pope Pius XII's 1936 Cadillac V16 Series 90 Ceremonial Town Car by Fleetwood and a classic prewar racing car, a 1936 Alfa Romeo 8C 2900A short-chassis Botticella Grand Prix winner, which is being sold to raise money to preserve the Brazilian rain forest.</p>
        <p>''The Botticella is the be-all and end-all of pre-World War II sporting cars,'' said Paul Clark, managing director of Brooks U.S.A. Only four short-chassis models were made, all built to race.</p>
        <p>Christie's International Motor Cars is conducting its 11th annual ''Exceptional Motor Cars'' sale on Sunday at the Pebble Beach Equestrian Center. This sale, which begins at 6 p.m. Pacific time, will have a live Webcast (www.christies.com), so interested collectors around the world can participate.</p>
        <p>The sale includes the car collection of the late Denver lumber magnate Robert D. Sutherland, which features several prewar American and European racing cars and has a sales estimate of at least $5 million, and 50 classic cars from the collection of Matt and Barbara Browning of the Browning firearms family.</p>
        <p>For the 15th year, the Monterey Sports Car Auction will hold its sales in Monterey at the Doubletree Hotel, tonight and tomorrow. This sale has 135 vintage cars of the more reasonably priced variety.</p>
        <p>The only great car missing in California is one that will be sold on Sept. 27 in New York in the William Doyle sale of property from the estate of James Cagney. The Doyle sale is not a car sale, but it does include Cagney's elegant 1961 green Bentley S2 four-door saloon.</p>
        <p>Cagney, who won an Academy Award for his role in ''Yankee Doodle Dandy'' in 1942, played a race car driver in the 1932 film ''The Crowd Roars.'' His Oscar is displayed in the Brooks tent with an announcement about the September sale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brooks is making a push to penetrate the antique car market in America. He founded Brooks Auctioneers in England in 1989 after working for 14 years at Christie's in London. The son of a legendary London auctioneer, Mr. Brooks took over Christie's motor car department in 1977. In 1989, after organizing a Christie's car sale in Monte Carlo that brought in $33.4 million, he asked to be put on Christie's international board.</p>
        <p>His request was denied, and he left Christie's to start Brooks. ''We are the biggest specialist auctioneers of motor cars in the world,'' he said. ''Last year we did 33 auctions in 9 countries.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brooks conducts sales of what he calls ''mechanical antiquities'' -- that is, motor cars, motorcycles, automobilia, aeronautica, mechanical toys and watches. Last year he reported car sales of $46 million. ''We sell 800 to 1,000 cars per year,'' he said. ''We have 40 percent of the U. K. market. But the U. S. is the home of motorcar collecting. In America the competition is fierce. It's exciting.''</p>
        <p>Brooks neither buys nor restores cars. ''At the end of the day, the owner is selling the car,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''We might polish it, but we don't fix it. And we don't do third-party auctions. We only act as an agent for people who want to sell their cars.''</p>
        <p>Christie's normally doesn't buy cars, either, but in Carmel it will sell at least one it owns: a 1908 Roll-Royce Silver Ghost Landaulette made for Lord Dundas of Dundas Castle in Scotland. It was built to be especially quiet; hence, the name Silver Ghost. (And it was made by C. S. Rolls and Henry Royce, as well as Claude Johnson, a founder of the Royal Automobile Club.) ''It's one of the earliest Silver Ghosts ever built, and it's one of the most important of the early ones,'' Mr. Morris said.</p>
        <p>Car auctions are not like sales of Impressionist paintings. ''This is a market that, to a degree, is event- or club-driven,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''Many sales are set at racing sites. In Carmel, everyone shows up for the Monterey Historic Automobile Races, one of the top races in the world.''</p>
        <p>''I'm a great believer in the importance of sale venues,'' he added. ''With motorcars, it's London, Gstaad, Geneva, Monte Carlo and Carmel.'' Brooks's December sale, which is held in Gstaad at the Palace Hotel, consists entirely of Ferraris. ''The sale is part of the social season,'' he said. ''People are attracted to the location.''</p>
        <p>Of the 20,000 expected at the Concours d'Elegance, 2,000 will attend the sales. Mr. Clark said that 700 to 1,000 people register to bid in Brooks's California sale. Of these, at least 150 will bid. Information: (831) 620-1950.</p>
        <p>''Everyone can appreciate a car, no matter what sector of society you come from,'' Mr. Clark said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brooks remarked, ''The beauty of motor cars is the third dimension, the movement.''</p>
        <p>The auctioneer, who still races his own cars, observed, ''Cars appeal to the little child in all of us.''</p>
