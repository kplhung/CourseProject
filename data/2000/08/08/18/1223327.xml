        <p>This week's DVD releases include ''Nashville,'' with a commentary by Robert Altman, and ''Planet of the Apes: The Evolution,'' Fox's umbrella title for the Charlton Heston epic and its four sequels (''Beneath the . . .,'' ''Escape From . . .,'' ''Conquest of . . .'' and ''Battle for . . .'') on five discs, along with a sixth disc with the documentary ''Behind the Planet of the Apes,'' about the making of the series. And on Tuesday will come ''The Tigger Movie,'' with assorted games and songs about the Pooh clan augmenting a sweet little film from Disneywith muscle enough to take in more than $40 million at the box office.</p>
        <p>But the DVD of the month will arrive a week later: James Cameron's ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' (1991), to be released by Artisanon Aug. 29. In the minds of many disc aficionados, ''T2,'' as it is known, is the ultimate. ''The general consensus was that it was the greatest laser disk ever produced,'' said Douglas Pratt, editor of the DVD Newsletter and author of The DVD Video Guide. When DVD was new, ''T2,'' a sequel starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a machine man dispatched from the future to rescue a little boy destined to save mankind, was issued at its original theater length. Now, scenes have been added and many of the supplements that were on the laser disc have been transferred to accompany new ones on a special DVD edition.</p>

        <p>This week's DVD releases include ''Nashville,'' with a commentary by Robert Altman, and ''Planet of the Apes: The Evolution,'' Fox's umbrella title for the Charlton Heston epic and its four sequels (''Beneath the . . .,'' ''Escape From . . .,'' ''Conquest of . . .'' and ''Battle for . . .'') on five discs, along with a sixth disc with the documentary ''Behind the Planet of the Apes,'' about the making of the series.

        <p>But the DVD of the month will arrive a week later: James Cameron's ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' (1991), to be released by Artisanon Aug. 29. In the minds of many disc aficionados, ''T2,'' as it is known, is the ultimate. ''The general consensus was that it was the greatest laser disk ever produced,'' said Douglas Pratt, editor of the DVD Newsletter and author of The DVD Video Guide. When DVD was new, ''T2,'' a sequel starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a machine man dispatched from the future to rescue a little boy destined to save mankind, was issued at its original theater length. Now, scenes have been added and many of the supplements that were on the laser disc have been transferred to accompany new ones on a special DVD edition.</p>
        <p>The list of extra features totals 40. ''For all the people who haven't seen the laser disc, which is 99 percent of the population, the DVD will be a revelation,'' said Van Ling, a DVD producer who put together the supplements for laser in 1993 and helped create the new DVD. That has to do primarily with the quality of picture and sound. ''It is considered one of the standard demonstration films for home theater,'' he said. And the effects, with machine men rising from melting silvery puddles, play at their best on large television screens.</p>
        <p>But in other respects this is a movie with a good reputation. ''From the standpoint of a film and disc buff, it's a virtual catalog of cinematic technique,'' he said. Or as Janet Maslin put it in The New York Times, ''Surprise. Mr. Cameron has made a swift, exciting special-effects epic'' with ''better developed characters (after all, the first Terminator was barely verbal), a livelier wit and a more ambitious, if nuttier, message.''</p>
        <p>For the DVD, Mr. Ling said, he tried to present a film school class, with much material on production and editing and other aspects of big-budget moviemaking, from writing and editing to location scouting and promotion. The new disc employs an interesting approach to the director's commentary, also borrowed from the laser disc. Instead of a film-length discourse by Mr. Cameron and Mr. Schwarzenegger, which neither would do in the first place, the commentary pieces together parts of interviews with 26 people who made the movie. ''Sometimes,'' Mr. Ling said, ''directors get so engrossed watching the movie they stop talking.''</p>
