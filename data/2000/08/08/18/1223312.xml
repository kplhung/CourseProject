        <p>In ''Drawings 2000,'' the current show at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery, there are works on paper by no fewer than 111 artists. All were made this year.</p>
        <p>The show makes a long look and a long walk, but it's worth it. Good new works on paper are in almost every case a declaration of independence. ''This is ME!'' the artist is saying. ''ME, and nobody else!''</p>

        <p>In ''Drawings 2000,'' the current show at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery, there are works on paper by no fewer than 111 artists. All were made this year.</p>
        <p>The show makes a long look and a long walk, but it's worth it. Good new works on paper are in almost every case a declaration of independence. ''This is ME!'' the artist is saying. ''ME, and nobody else!''</p>
        <p>The Gladstone show supports this point by proving that in the year 2000 there are more and more ways to make works on paper. And many of the artists in this show are more and more ready to spell out the particular ways of working that they have favored.</p>
        <p>Substances without precedent in former times are now widely in use. Acrylic on wool, paintstick on Mylar, alkyd and aerosol on gessoed paper, toner with solvent on paper, C-print and ink on acetate overlay: all find a good home, as do ''ink, graphite, colored pencil, photograph on paper and museum board,'' in one case, and ''graphite, colored pencil and gesso on an Andy Warhol serigraph'' in another. Matthew Barney may also earn commendation for his use of a ''self-lubricating plastic frame.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes these elaborations culminate in a result that is both completely serious and wonderfully dandified. This happens, for instance, when Brice Marden uses ''sepia wash, sepia ink and Kremer white shellac, on 33 lb. Lanaquarelle paper.''</p>
        <p>Barbara Gladstone foresees that ''we are faced with an almost incomprehensible expansion of new media -- especially with the proliferation of uses for the computer and the revolutionary impact of the Internet.'' These tools, she says, ''will shape the 21st century as purely as the steel beam and the elevator have changed the nature of architecture.''</p>
        <p>This may or may not prove to be true. But the present show also relates to another of Ms. Gladstone's perceptions: that ''as our world is rapidly changing, there is a renewed interest in humanism.'' I don't think she means that her artists have been boning up on Erasmus, but simply that most of them want to deal with other human beings in a sympathetic and understanding way.</p>
        <p>One of the best things in the show, in that context, is by two artists who live in Vienna, Markus Montean and Adi Rosenblum. Done with acrylic and crayon on paper, the work shows a radiantly beautiful and happy young woman who fills almost the whole of the image. Huddled way behind her in the lower right-hand corner is a woebegone older figure.</p>
        <p>The tale is told in a handwritten coda at the bottom of the image.  ''Language,'' it says, ''allows us to hide under an illusory permanence and fixity while the world changes minute by minute.''</p>
        <p>If that's the new humanism, let's have more of it.</p>
        <p>The unsparing study of oneself is also a part of humanism. Francesco Clemente is one of the most searching portraitists around, and his ''Self-Portrait'' stands out in this show. We see his head twice over, as if two medallions were one on top of the other. His taut, wary gaze almost singes the air.</p>
        <p>There is also a place for mischief in the context of this putative humanism. Jane Kaplowitz has been scavenging for years among the folk images of our day, and in ''The Planet of the Apes'' she sends up one of the more hilarious among them. The scale counts, too. Few images in the show tell so strongly from a distance.</p>
        <p>It is also fundamental to the new humanism that a considerable candor is allowed in sexual situations. Never one to flag in this domain, Cecily Brown gives us, in her untitled drawing, a tumultuous idea of what it can mean to sit on a sofa with one or two (or three) friends.</p>
        <p>Even sharper is Sue Williams's ink drawing, simply called ''Can't.'' As that title suggests, it is about an erotic encounter between a young man and a young woman that for one reason or another fell short of expectations. When we see how the young woman's monumental right leg shoots up the edge of the drawing, we see what an opportunity was missed.</p>
        <p>It should be said that many of the most successful of these works on paper are by people who have a long record of first-rate work behind them and see no reason to chase  after new fads and fancies. Among them are Richard Serra, Ellsworth Kelly, Vija Celmins, Elizabeth Murray, Alex Katz, Joel Shapiro, Kiki Smith, Terry Winters, Ellen Phelan and Sol LeWitt. A Spanish guest, Antoni Tapies, should also be included.</p>
        <p>Among the drawings that are well worth looking at, even if they will never rival ''the steel beam and the elevator'' in their effect on the world we live in, one might single out the large sheet of stage designs for a production of Martha Graham's  ''Appalachian Spring,'' to music by Aaron Copland. This is by Sam Durant, and it racks up a long list of details that many balletgoers will remember, among them the rocking chair by Isamu Noguchi.</p>
        <p>This is, finally, an ecumenical show in which Barbara Gladstone saw to it that almost every kind of effort found a place. There are quieter drawings like Elizabeth Peyton's ''Tony Awake,'' and flashes of the human comedy like John Currin's ''Mrs. So-and-So.'' Robert Bechtle's ''Arkansas Street'' is the epitome of a certain America, as is April Gornik's ''Windward Sky.'' This wildly generous show should not be missed.</p>
        <p>''Drawings 2000'' remains at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 206-9300, through Aug. 31.</p>
