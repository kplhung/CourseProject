        <p>Many commentators have noted the impact that the coming election will have on the direction of the Supreme Court. But a compelling issue for the federal courts is being overlooked. With the next president expected to appoint more than 20 federal appellate judges and close to 100 federal district court judges, the candidates and their parties should articulate the extent of their commitment to diversity on the federal bench.</p>
        <p>After the political conventions, voters might be confused about which party truly stands for diversity and pluralism, but the position of the parties on this issue is clear from their behavior.</p>
        <p>The 35th anniversary of the signing of the Voting Rights Act on Aug. 6 came just a day after the first anniversary of a less-publicized event, the nomination of James Wynn Jr. to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Wynn, currently serving on the North Carolina Court of Appeals, is the second of three African-Americans whom President Clinton has nominated to the Fourth Circuit. No African-American has ever served on this court even though the states that make up the Fourth Circuit have the largest population of African-Americans of any appellate circuit in the country.</p>
        <p>President Clinton's first two attempts to desegregate the Fourth Circuit were blocked by Senator Jesse Helms, using review powers accorded to senators over nominees from their own states. Senator Helms has argued that the Fourth Circuit is operating efficiently at its current size.</p>
        <p>Rather than support the nomination of qualified African-Americans, he is content to leave the 15-member court with four vacancies and no representation from North Carolina. Two of these vacancies have been declared judicial emergencies; one seat has been vacant for 10 years, longer than any seat in the country.</p>
        <p>On June 30, President Clinton tried to circumvent the Helms obstacle by nominating Roger Gregory to fill the seat that has been vacant for 10 years. Mr. Gregory, an African-American from Virginia, has received the bipartisan endorsement of both his home-state senators. Still, the Republican-led Judiciary Committee has not acted to give him a hearing, the first step in the confirmation process.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to reconcile this opposition to integrating the federal bench with the image of inclusiveness projected from the Republican Convention. George W. Bush recently stated that the Senate has an obligation to act promptly on judicial nominations and that he would expect action within 60 days on any he made. The record of the Republican-controlled Senate makes a mockery of this standard.</p>
        <p>President Harry Truman began the process of desegregating the federal judiciary in 1949, by nominating William H. Hastie, but by 1976 only four African-Americans had been appointed to the federal appellate courts. President Jimmy Carter made dramatic strides during his four years in office, appointing nine African-Americans to these courts. When he left office, however, the tide reversed. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush made only three African-American circuit court appointments during their combined 12 years in office -- a lower ratio of black appointments to courts of appeals than F.W. de Klerk had in his tenure as the last apartheid leader of South Africa, as Judge A. Leon Higginbotham noted at the time.</p>
        <p>President Clinton brought new conviction to the task, nominating 13 African-Americans thus far, but he is still making up lost ground. Only last month did the representation of African-Americans on the federal appellate courts reach the same level as in 1980. The struggle for integration of the federal courts has essentially stood still for the past 20 years.</p>
        <p>Many of the judicial nominees who have waited longest for confirmation since Republicans took control of Congress in 1994 are women or minorities. The striking disparity in the speed of confirmations suggests that these nominees are being more closely scrutinized because of stereotypical assumptions that their positions on legal issues are tied to their race or sex.</p>
        <p>Those African-Americans who have been given a chance to serve on the federal bench cannot be characterized as having followed a judicial agenda defined by their race. Far from being interested only in issues of civil rights, African-American judges have written crucial decisions in areas as wide-ranging as criminal justice, maritime law and intellectual property. African-Americans who have served on the federal bench have proved to be not ideological extremists, but respected jurists. President Clinton's nominees, the most diverse group for any president, have the highest ratings from the American Bar Association in 40 years. The goal of diversity clearly does not entail a sacrifice in quality.</p>
        <p>Senator Helms stated last year that the people of North Carolina don't care who sits on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. ''It matters only to politicians and newspaper editors,'' he claimed. But people do care who sits on the federal bench, and they should. Increasing the representation of women and minorities serves to ensure that the judicial system reflects the broad perspectives of society.</p>
        <p>Describing the immense contribution that Justice Thurgood Marshall made in this regard, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor explained, ''At oral arguments and conference meetings, in opinions and dissents, Justice Marshall imparted not only his legal acumen but also his life experiences, pushing and prodding us to respond not only to the persuasiveness of legal argument but also to the power of moral truth.''</p>
        <p>Judge Higginbotham, who served with distinction on a federal appellate court in Pennsylvania, explained that diversity reinforces the legitimacy of the courts. ''Pluralism is a sine qua non in building a court that is both substantively excellent and respected by the general population,'' he said. ''Judicial homogeneity, by contrast, is more often than not a deterrent to, rather than a promoter of, equal justice for all.''</p>
        <p>With the nomination of Roger Gregory from Virginia, the Republican-controlled Senate now has the chance to demonstrate a commitment to equality in judicial confirmations. It should seize this opportunity as soon as possible.</p>
