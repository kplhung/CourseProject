        <p>With the number of pools of infected mosquitoes climbing and the peak mosquito season approaching, New York City officials yesterday unveiled additional plans for the season's most comprehensive spraying campaign against the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>The ground-spraying campaign, which the city had said would begin in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn last night, will move to the areas of Prospect Park and Green-Wood Cemetery tonight. In Manhattan, Central Park will be sprayed twice -- tomorrow and Tuesday -- and the swath of Manhattan from 23rd to 155th Street will be sprayed tomorrow.</p>

        <p>With the number of pools of infected mosquitoes climbing and the peak mosquito season approaching, New York City officials yesterday unveiled additional plans for the season's most comprehensive spraying campaign against the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>The ground-spraying campaign, which the city had said would begin in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn last night, will move to the areas of Prospect Park and Green-Wood Cemetery tonight. In Manhattan, Central Park will be sprayed twice -- tomorrow and Tuesday -- and the swath of Manhattan from 23rd to 155th Street will be sprayed tomorrow.</p>
        <p>In Queens, officials plan to spray within a two-mile radius of Whitestone on Sunday night. There also will be spraying on Sunday in the Bronx, within two miles of Hunts Point. Roosevelt Island will be sprayed tomorrow; Rikers Island is scheduled for Sunday.</p>
        <p>Details of the schedule came a day after the New York State Health Department reported that 27 additional mosquito pools in New York City had tested positive for the virus, more than doubling the previous confirmed total. In all, three people, all Staten Island residents, have tested positive for the virus this year.</p>
        <p>Throughout the state, officials have scrambled to spray as many affected areas as possible; in Rockland County, which has recorded the most infected birds to date, Orangetown will be sprayed on Monday and Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, state health officials reported no additional pools of infected mosquitoes in New York City, though there were nine more in Suffolk County, four in Rockland County and one in Orange County. And another mosquito species (Aedes triseriatus, a common species that thrives in dark areas and feeds at dawn and dusk) was found to be infected with the virus, bringing the number of known carriers to five.</p>
        <p>''Mosquito protection strategies need to be employed at any time of day that you will be outside,'' said Kristine Smith, a spokeswoman for the State Health Department.</p>
        <p>That reminder, officials said, is even more important as the summer winds down and mosquitoes become most active. The virus, which killed 7 people and sickened 55 others in the metropolitan region last year, will probably persist for several years throughout the Northeast, said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
