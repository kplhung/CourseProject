        <p>''If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be the most exciting politician,'' Al Gore said as he ended his acceptance speech with what seemed, after months of wrestling with the issue, a defiant acknowledgment of fact. Even in a speech declaring himself a man of the future, he was conspicuously uncomfortable as a media candidate. Watching his acceptance was like watching the televised version of a stage play, the kind in which the cameras stand back and put the television audience in the position of distant voyeurs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore nodded as he looked out over the crowd, as if he could connect with individuals in that vast room; that was an effective performance in itself. Yet when he looked toward the camera, he actually seemed to be looking into the teleprompter. And a convincing performance once removed is not what a television campaign needs.</p>
        <p>His one hour in prime time had been preceded by two days of character witnesses, as family and friends appeared in an endless loop of interviews on the morning shows, late shows and everywhere in between. More than once, Tipper Gore and Tommy Lee Jones blamed the office of the vice presidency for Mr. Gore's much-talked-about stiffness. He had been standing so loyally in the background, they argued, that of course he couldn't seem as lively as he was in private. In his speech last night, when he said his mother was from a town named Cold Corner, you could almost imagine them protesting, ''Don't say cold! He's not cold!''</p>
        <p>Oddly, the most effective view of the human side of Mr. Gore came from a short biographical film made for the campaign by Spike Jonze, the director who got his start in music videos before making the sly film ''Being John Malkovich.'' Mr. Jonze is a master of meticulous films that create the illusion of looseness, and he used the intimacy of hand-held cameras, and smooth editing that looked tossed together, to recreate the Gore image.</p>
        <p>In the film, the vice president is seen with his family, walking through the woods of Tennessee, making funny faces (well, not that funny) at his grandson, and singing (off key) a jingle from one of his father's old campaigns. ''Vote for Gore, vote for Gore, He's wise and able, And he's just forty-four.'' Tipper Gore talks about their first date. ''Was I a little stiff?'' he asks. ''Not at all,'' she says and they kiss for the camera. That of course was the message, which Mr. Gore made explicit. ''I'm a lot more comfortable with the idea of rolling up my sleeves and making the system work than I am with campaigning,'' he said in the film.</p>
        <p>But the Jonze film was almost sneaked on the air at an especially off time, 7:30 Tuesday night, as if it were being tested. It was carried only by MSNBC and CSPAN, but clips popped up over the next 24 hours on ABC's ''Nightline'' and ''Good Morning America,'' and on CNN. Something similar in prime time might have gone a long way toward delivering on the promise of showing a new, warmer Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Instead, Tipper Gore introduced  her husband last night with a typically homogenized campaign film, loaded with sentiment and family photographs. The cable news channels, along with PBS and NBC, carried that film, while CBS and ABC replaced it with their own fuller reports, complete with references to the Buddhist temple incident.</p>
        <p>''This campaign is not about the gestures I make in an interview,'' Mr. Gore said in the ABC report, but of course campaigning is largely about imagery. If not, his family wouldn't have worked overtime to  create the warm gestures for him. He needed that long smooch with Tipper on the podium last night to suggest a warmth he would never display on his own.</p>
        <p>In the end, watching both the conventions was like watching a less lively, political version of ''Jurassic Park,'' with two dinosaurs colliding. The networks -- the dinosaurs of the television world compared to cable news -- are cowering and cutting back coverage while wondering how to deal with the conventions, those dinosaurs of the political world. (Even Clinton advisers like Harold Ickes, interviewed on CNN, and Leon Panetta, on MSNBC, said the convention should be cut back to two days.)  And we know what happened to all those dinosaurs.</p>
