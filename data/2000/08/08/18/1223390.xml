        <p>A federal judge in Manhattan ruled yesterday that a Web site operator cannot distribute a computer program used to crack codes that prevent the piracy of movies.</p>
        <p>The ruling, a victory for the motion picture industry, applies only to the Web site operator, Eric Corley, and his company, 2600 Enterprises. But experts on both sides of the issue agreed that the decision could have far greater reach as the courts hammer out legal guidelines that will govern the rules of commerce and free speech in the digital world.</p>
        <p>At issue was the distribution of a code-breaking computer program that can be used to copy movies from digital versatile discs, or DVD's. Like recent decisions concerning the unauthorized transmission of music over the Internet using programs like Napster, the DVD case had been closely watched by the entertainment industry and Internet groups.</p>
        <p>Motion picture companies argued that they had invested tremendous amounts of money on the assurance, through long-recognized copyright laws, that they would have the exclusive right to sell their movies to the public. Their opponents argued that new federal laws intended to protect those copyrights were overly restrictive, both by unreasonably blocking the legitimate use of digital movies and by illegally infringing on their right to free speech under the Constitution.</p>
        <p>In a detailed analysis, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan tried to weigh both positions and to measure Congress's 1998 guidelines for Internet copyright, known as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Judge Kaplan found that Congress had clearly intended to prohibit the distribution of software used to circumvent copyright protections, something he said the defendant's Web site did by posting the code-breaking program.</p>
        <p>''Each side is entitled to its views,'' Judge Kaplan wrote. ''In our society, however, clashes of competing interests like this are resolved by Congress.''</p>
        <p>Judge Kaplan found that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which prohibits the distribution of software intended to circumvent copyright protections, did not violate Mr. Corley's First Amendment right to free speech, and he prohibited Mr. Corley from posting the program in the future or from establishing Internet links with other sites that provided copies of the code.</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, defense lawyers asserted that Judge Kaplan's analysis was incorrect and said they would appeal. Martin Garbus, Mr. Corley's lawyer, said the decision would have made its way to higher courts no matter what the outcome because ''this is an issue that has to be decided by the Supreme Court.'' But he said his client would comply with the ruling while the appeal proceeded.</p>
        <p>Because Judge Kaplan sits on the district court, which is the trial court of the federal system, his decision is not binding on other federal courts and is subject to review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. But the judge's decision has considerable persuasive force for other courts both because it is the first time the law has been tested and because the Manhattan court is among the more prestigious district courts.</p>
        <p>''It is a very important case dealing with how intellectual material is going to be transmitted over the Web,'' Mr. Garbus said. ''The Internet, as a free exchange of information, is crippled by this decision.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the motion picture industry said the case was not about free speech, but about efforts to circumvent copyright protections that were established by Congress. ''What we sued the defendants for was circumventing our protective device,'' said Leon P. Gold, the lawyer for the movie companies. Mr. Gold likened the code-breaking programs to a key that could be used to break into a bank vault.</p>
        <p>''You cannot steal any other person's property, even if it is copyrighted property,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The decoding program at issue in the case is called DeCSS, because it counters the encryption system known as CSS, for content scrambling system. It was devised by a Norwegian teenager and made available, among other places, on Mr. Corley's Web site, 2600.com, based on Long Island. The movie industry filed suit in January and won a temporary injunction against Mr. Corley. Separate cases are pending in California and Norway.</p>
        <p>The extent of any unauthorized copying resulting from the DeCSS program is unclear. But to the plaintiffs, the very potential for piracy was the issue.</p>
        <p>Although yesterday's decision is among the first to balance free speech and copyright protection on the Internet, the courts have been measuring the tension between the two concepts in other media for well over 100 years.</p>
        <p>''The First Amendment protects speech, and the copyright statute restricts the uses of speech,'' said William W. Fisher, a professor at Harvard Law School. ''There is a tension between these two.''</p>
        <p>A traditional exception to copyright law has been the concept of fair use, which usually means the excerpting of material for scholarly, journalistic or artistic purposes. A book review that quotes from a novel is typically not a violation of copyright law because it is considered fair use.</p>
        <p>But Congress severely restricted the fair use concept in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, in part as a recognition that it is much easier to copy and distribute copyrighted material over the Internet than by photocopying or videotaping. The defendants tried to use the fair use concept to defend their distribution of the code-breaking program, arguing that it could be used by scholars and others to make legitimate excerpts of movies. But Judge Kaplan denied that claim, saying that Congress considered this possibility and ''clearly faced up to and dealt with this question.''</p>
        <p>He said Congress had listened to arguments about the need to protect copyrighted works and the counterarguments that the protection would inhibit people with legitimate needs to excerpt those works, ''and it struck a balance among the competing interests.''</p>
        <p>The defendants also argued that computer code, including the code-breaking programs, is a form of speech and that Congress cannot lawfully restrict their ability to transmit the code under the First Amendment. But Judge Kaplan rejected that argument as well.</p>
        <p>''Computer code is not purely expressive,'' he said, ''any more than the assassination of a political figure is purely a political statement.''</p>
        <p>Judge Kaplan found that because the restriction of the code-breaking program was not based on the idea it conveyed, Congress had greater latitude to establish restrictions. He ruled that the law was ''content neutral'' and ''in furtherance of important governmental interests that does not unduly restrict expressive activities.''</p>
        <p>In a more limited section of his opinion, the judge also forbade Mr. Corley to establish Internet links with other Web sites that made the code-breaking program available. But Judge Kaplan made it clear that the links to the sites would be unlawful only if someone could prove that the person that established the links did so with the express purpose of transmitting the code-breaking program.</p>
