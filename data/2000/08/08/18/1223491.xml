        <p>The 120th Alabama Stakes for 3-year-old fillies drew a field of nine yesterday, but tomorrow's race at Saratoga still shaped up as a test and a tie breaker for Secret Status and Jostle, the two best fillies in the East.</p>
        <p>Secret Status, the winner of the Kentucky Oaks and the Mother Goose, drew the No. 4 post position. Jostle, who won the Black-Eyed Susan and the Coaching Club American Oaks, drew the No. 9 post. The race will take them a mile and a quarter, and will offer a purse of $750,000 and the chance to become racing's leading 3-year-old filly.</p>

        <p>The 120th Alabama Stakes for 3-year-old fillies drew a field of nine yesterday, but tomorrow's race at Saratoga still shaped up as a test and a tie breaker for Secret Status and Jostle, the two best fillies in the East.</p>
        <p>Secret Status, the winner of the Kentucky Oaks and the Mother Goose, drew the No. 4 post position. Jostle, who won the Black-Eyed Susan and the Coaching Club American Oaks, drew the No. 9 post. The race will take them a mile and a quarter, and will offer a purse of $750,000 and the chance to become racing's leading 3-year-old filly.</p>
        <p>In the Mother Goose at Belmont Park on July 1, Secret Status set a fast pace as the 3-5 favorite and surged to win by two and a quarter lengths over Jostle, overlooked at odds of 18-1. In the Coaching Club American Oaks last month, Jostle was the only true speed horse in the race, but set a slow pace before drawing off to win by three and a quarter lengths. Secret Status, the 2-5 favorite, finished third.</p>
        <p>Secret Status had things go her way in the Mother Goose, and she won, said John Servis, who trains Jostle. We had things go our way in the Coaching Club, and we won. The Alabama is the true test for both fillies.</p>
        <p>Neil Howard, who trains Secret Status and her fast entrymate, Valleydar, agreed with his rival, saying, As far as determining a championship, this race will mean a lot.</p>
        <p>The role of spoiler probably rests with Spain, the daughter of Thunder Gulch. Spain, who is trained by D. Wayne Lukas, won the Monmouth Oaks and will be running for her third straight triumph.</p>
