        <p>The self-proclaimed Kings of Comedy in Spike Lee's concert film ''The Original Kings of Comedy'' couldn't be more resplendent in the outfits they wear onstage. Filmed before a live audience on two nights in February in Charlotte, N.C., Steve Harvey, D. L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac swagger across the stage, urban legends in outfits that can best be described as Mack-tastic, suits that qualify as Players' finery. If there's any real competition among them, it's in their suits.</p>
        <p>For the most part, the Kings' tour last winter escaped media scrutiny -- there was the odd condescending magazine piece -- despite being one of the most profitable stage shows in recent memory, showing the power and hunger of the African-American audiences.</p>
        <p>Until a couple of years ago, the comedians' exposure was limited mostly to cable television; all the Kings have spent time on HBO's ''Def Comedy Jam,'' or in Mr. Hughley's case, BET's ''Comic View'' -- ''Def'' gone even more ghetto. Here, their comedy gives audiences that  have never seen anything like it a  hilarious window on a new world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harvey, the star of ''The Steve Harvey Show'' on the WB network, starts off the film as M.C. Harvey, who also patrols the perimeter of the stage on ''It's Showtime at the Apollo,'' unleashing the Sandman with his hook to snag minimally talented contestants offstage. He wears a suit with a squared bottom and a single flap across the bottom. (Later he changes into an off-white shadow stripe number, as if preparing to star in an all-black version of ''Fantasy Island.'')</p>
        <p>With his flat-top fade haircut now trimmed so it's no longer within range of air-traffic control, Mr. Harvey unleashes a shotgun splatter of profanity. It may shock audiences who know him only from ''The Steve Harvey Show,'' where he plays Steve Hightower, rhythm-and-blues star turned teacher. (Perhaps this confusion stems from the fact that Mr. Harvey and Hightower both dress as if they record for the rhythm-and-blues label Philadelphia International.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Harvey is best at imagery. His upper lip curled so deep in disgust that it cuts a dimple into his cheek, he begins by riffing on ''Titanic,'' talking about how the band stayed on to play, a notion he finds totally unbelievable. ''If Kool and the Gang had been the band . . .,'' he says, then  starts expertly wrapping the mike cord around his arm, miming the packing up of stage equipment.</p>
        <p>It makes sense that Mr. Harvey would play a former soul music pro on his series. ''I'm a 1974 brother,'' he notes, referring to what he considers the pinnacle of black music. In a recent performance with the O-Jays at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan, where his love of his fellow Ohioans and their classic soul lifted him, he almost levitated as he reveled; when Mr. Harvey smiles, he goes into another world.</p>
        <p>He swings into a definition of the differences between rap and old-school funk, gracefully impersonating the Temptation Walk -- ''five dudes and just one mike'' -- to the self-absorbed cacophony of rap, where everyone has a mike and cannot be understood. ''Rappers make me sick!'' he says with a grimace, to a huge wave of applause. (That remark has a special meaning for viewers of his sitcom, where rappers turn up as guest stars.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Harvey is followed by D. L. Hughley, wearing a tan suit with peaked lapels that could serve as ailerons. Again, those who know Mr. Hughley from a sitcom -- ''The Hughleys'' in his case -- may blanch  at the banal profanity. They display their chops when they talk about family, specifically African-American family with roots in the South, which shows there's still something to the concept of the perceived monolithic black experience. (Mr. Harvey, who grew up in Cleveland, and Mr. Mac, a Chicagoan, sound as if they came right out of the South.) It's what gives these men a connection with the audience -- Mr. Hughley is on a high when talking about family behavior -- and shows why their tour sold out on the order of the Steve Martin tours of the 1970's.</p>
        <p>The material on the cohesiveness of black family is still new to much of the country. But for those who have grown up living what these comics talk about, this is a chance to see a part of their lives exhibited in the mainstream and in the context of a community of like-minded folks. (Given how quickly these extended families are disappearing, it also suggests a sense of loss.) What comes out of these comedians' hearts hits the most powerful chord, and the audience wants more of it.</p>
        <p>The Kings' debt to Richard Pryor's concert films is implicit; if nothing else, it explains the downtown magnificence of their apparel. Mr. Pryor found the true, idiosyncratic note and made it universal. And despite what has been written about him as being a scared, pathetic clown, in his performances the threat of physical violence hung in the air; a friend once described him as the kind who would take a gun to a prayer meeting. We may never see another comedian comment so compellingly on his flamboyant self-destructiveness, and so, in contrast, the  Kings feel safe, not challenging.</p>
        <p>Yet there's an energy that comes from their rapport with their crowd. (And their ease with one another is apparent in backstage interviews included in the movie.) There is also the connection that comes from their wardrobes; with more pleats than a Catholic schoolgirl uniform store, they are an expensively customized version of what their constituency wears. Mr. Lee catches members of the audience posing for the cameras in their concert wear, grooving to the  70's music. The show, which played in four cities before opening in New York and touring the nation, was recorded on digital video and transferred to film; it looks fine, but unremarkable.</p>
        <p>The show includes too much of the ''white people do act this way'' brand of comedy, an idea that was best dismissed on an old ''Simpsons'' episode when a black comedian, standing before a brick ''Night at the Improv''-type wall, did a groan-worthy routine about the goofy way whites drive, and Homer, laughing himself silly, gasped: ''It's true. We're so lame.'' There is some great material from this perspective: Mr. Hughley notes that black people don't ski or do other dangerous physical activities because they experience enough peril just trying to get through the average day. ''Bungee jumping,'' he says. ''That's too much like hanging.'' And the remarkably genial Cedric, a light-on-his-feet big man, embellishes the differences between hope and wish: white people hope that nothing goes wrong and blacks wish someone would start some trouble.</p>
        <p>Cedric is the most conservative dresser, clad in a pin-striped double-breasted blue suit. But that's a sleeveless double-breasted suit, so that all the details of his shirt cuffs, with their bright, slant-cut white contrasts, are visible. Like the other  Kings, he shows hints of anger in his work; he discusses how angry a black president might become if a Monica Lewinsky question were posed at a news conference. ''You gonna ask me about that in front of my wife?'' he responds, leaping toward an imaginary reporter. ''The  president fight too much. He just like Anthony Mason.''</p>
        <p>Sports figures don't get off easy either; Mr. Harvey works over the football player Rae Carruth's dismal attempt at a getaway after he was accused of murder.</p>
        <p>Cedric simply has more bounce to the ounce than the others, and his joy at playing to a crowd makes it clear why he's called the Entertainer. Especially when he does a routine about smoking (''You can't smoke nowhere on earf,'' he says, marking himself as a California resident) that concludes with a brilliant physical bit on a street corner player who makes every smoker's gesture a piece of ghetto theater. He flies across the stage, scoring with small points.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mac, in a taupe suit and chocolate satin shirt and tie, is the most autobiographical of the group. He turns his comedy on himself, and with a dignified short Afro replacing his messy perm of the 90's, he is more in command than ever. He uses short, punchy attacks to make his point about his feigned lack of interest in sex -- sometimes shooting a happy wink to the audience -- and he sounds like a preacher on a roll, using a melodramatic shortness of breath to punctuate his stand-up. He sums up with a piece on the ubiquity of a certain swear word, which he describes as ''a noun, a person, place or thing,'' and then proceeds to give the heft of an adjective and even transforms it into a split infinitive.</p>
        <p>His routine is the best shaped, and in his hands the cussing isn't tiresome. Using it to make a point, he comes off as King of Kings.</p>
        <p>''The Original Kings of Comedy'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes enough profanity to make Richard Pryor blush.</p>
