        <p>Two striking Verizon phone workers were nearly electrocuted early this morning when they mistakenly cut through a 13,000-volt power cable that they thought was a phone line, the police said.</p>
        <p>The workers, Joseph Hertzel, 26, and Joanne Pinder, 33, both of 3379 Parkway Drive in Baldwin Harbor, N.Y., survived but were showered with sparks and white-hot metal, said Officer Bill Bendel, a spokesman for the Nassau County Police Department. They were taken to the Nassau County Burn Unit, where they were listed in stable condition.</p>
        <p>The motive, investigators said, appeared to be sabotage on the 12th day of a strike by 86,000 technicians and customer service employees across 12 states. Verizon, the telephone giant formed recently by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the GTE Corporation, is at loggerheads with the unions representing the workers over job security and mandatory overtime.</p>
        <p>The incident occurred at 1:15 a.m. on Harrison Avenue, a residential street in Baldwin, when Mr. Hertzel and Ms. Pinder stepped out of a sport utility vehicle with a pair of pruning shears, the police said. There were two wires running up the side of a utility pole, one for telephone service, the other a power line with enough current to power 2,400 homes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hertzel cut what he believed was the phone line about a foot above sidewalk level. But he chose the wrong line and caused a plasma flash that sent sparks flying, according to the authorities.</p>
        <p>''That's a significant amount of electricity,'' said Bert Cunningham, a spokesman for the Long Island Power Authority. ''It's hot enough to vaporize metal, so individuals are actually showered with the intense heat and metal particles.''</p>
        <p>The phone workers' clothes and skin were burned, and the metal head of the shears was melted, the police said. Only by a quirk of physical science did the couple escape death.</p>
        <p>''The surge went up the pole and instead of the power being directed toward him and being grounded, it dispersed and he did not receive the full voltage,'' said Capt. Rich McGuire, an investigator for the Nassau police.</p>
        <p>The couple fled in their truck but were caught moments later by the police. They have been charged with criminal tampering and criminal mischief and will be arraigned at a later date, Officer Bendel said.</p>
        <p>The police said that the incident was the 33rd act of vandalism since the strike began. The Suffolk County police have recorded 28 such incidents.</p>
