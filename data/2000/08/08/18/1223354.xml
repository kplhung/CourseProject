        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>An increasing number of air passengers, hub scheduling and inept federal oversight of transportation have no doubt contributed to the decline in the quality of air travel that Joe Sharkey points out (Business Travel column, Aug. 13). But the main problem is that despite our complaints, we like air travel so much that we refuse to develop high-speed rail as a viable alternative. Here in the Midwest, sparsely populated farmland is ideal for train lines, but attempts to build them are hampered by the public outcry about subsidies and cost.</p>

        <p>Trains, especially on routes of 500 miles or less, would be more energy-efficient, more comfortable and less vulnerable to bad weather than planes. A network of such routes could dramatically reduce airport congestion. And as Mr. Sharkey points out, competition would give airlines an incentive to improve service.</p>
