        <p>Nearly everyone agrees on one thing: the old woman who sells live ducks and chickens from a makeshift stall does not belong on Tentmakers Street. The squawking, to say nothing of the dirty feathers that fly regularly from the alarmed birds, upsets the tourists.</p>
        <p>Unsightly poultry is not the only problem when renovating a 1,000-year-old neighborhood packed with crumbling mosques, ancient bazaars, illegal workshops, crowded apartments and world-famous monuments in one of the most densely populated cities in the world.</p>
        <p>What is to be done, for example, with the poor family that for generations has sold falafel from a stand it constructed smack against a once-beautiful and historic city gate? Or the people who long ago poured concrete over an ancient well to make a space to sell souvenirs? Or the little boys dragging wagons full of fabric for a dollar a day and madly dodging motorbikes carrying families of four out for a shopping spree?</p>
        <p>These are burning questions for the people of Tentmakers Street, a cramped and dim thoroughfare in the old heart of this old city where a government preservation project is tearing up the foundations of the buildings and, for many, a way of life.</p>
        <p>''Oh, back in the old days it was beautiful here,'' said Saad Ali, a 65-year-old tentmaker who was born a few streets away and started working in the craft with his father and grandfather when he was 10 years old. ''You could see the original stones and their colors and the wooden doors. Now that whole image is destroyed. The beauty is gone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ali sat cross-legged and barefoot on a worn cushion in a tiny alcove that has been his family's place of business for as long as anyone can remember. His eyeglasses are as thick as his calloused fingers, the cost of countless hours spent bent over his needlework.</p>
        <p>As he spoke, a donkey cart piled high with cartons bumped its way along the street just past his shoulder. The screeches of the neighbor woman's chickens joined the honking of speeding motorcycles and the whine of the machinery in the metalworking shop a few doors down to produce an ear-splitting noise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ali grimaced. ''In the old days, this street was peaceful and you had the chance to buy and sell,'' he said. ''Now the tourists have to dig their way in past all these inappropriate businesses.''</p>
        <p>For hundreds of years the people on Tentmakers Street made their living sewing ornate patchwork tapestries -- red, yellow, black and blue arabesque designs -- for the tents where Egyptians gather for funerals, weddings and other ceremonies.</p>
        <p>The little street, like traditional Middle East bazaars, was covered with a wooden canopy to protect the artisans from sun and rain. Each alcove had a high ceiling with wood beams and an airy workshop on the second floor. The archways over the entrances were made of multicolored stones laid in a fan design.</p>
        <p>Neighbors knew one another for generations, just as in the stories of Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel laureate who grew up in the neighborhood and used it as the model for his trilogy ''Children of the Alley.''</p>
        <p>These days, years of grime give the stone the uniform color of mud. The beamed ceilings have been obliterated with concrete, and the workshops are rented out to families living 10 to a room.</p>
        <p>Most people now buy machine-printed fabrics instead of the handmade tapestries, so the tentmakers sell their work as pillowcases and wall hangings for tourists. And with the decline of the old trade, small manufacturing operations and street vendors encroached on the remaining artisans of Tentmakers Street.</p>
        <p>The Egyptian government, along with foreign donors, aims to bring back the look of old Cairo to the crowded and frantically busy neighborhood around Tentmakers Street, known as Islamic, or Fatimid, Cairo.</p>
        <p>It has an ambitious renovation plan to sandblast away centuries of dirt from the facades, modernize the leaky sewage system, reinforce and repair the lofty minarets and mosques, clear the entrances to the monuments, and group the artisans together by craft as they were in the 18th- and 19th-century glory days of Cairo's bazaar life.</p>
        <p>Originally the walled imperial capital of the Fatimid dynasty, which  ruled Egypt in the early centuries of Islam, the one-and-a-half-square-mile neighborhood contains many of the city's most famous mosques, schools and markets. But most are dilapidated hulks, threatened by rising underground water and littered with garbage. And within the confines of Fatimid Cairo, still outlined in a few places by the remnants of the ramparts and massive stone gates, at least 365,000 people live, the Ministry of Culture estimates.</p>
        <p>Restoration work on many monuments has begun. Parts of Tentmakers Street have been gutted and some of the dirt cleaned from the archways of the old shops. There are rumors -- welcomed by many -- that the government will eventually ban cars and motorbikes from the area. But many people who live and work in the neighborhood wonder if they will be preserved along with the buildings.</p>
        <p>''Fine, renovate the area,'' said Muhammad Tawfik, who sells cheap shoes from a dingy stand in the shadow of Bab Zuweila, the westernmost gate to the old Fatimid city. ''But what about the people who make their living here?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tawfik said he had been assured by government officials that his store could remain, once the gate was refurbished and cleaned. But he has his doubts. Just across from him, another shoe-seller was told to clear out during renovations. Then workers uncovered a beautiful ornate decoration on the gate.</p>
        <p>''He'll never be allowed back, now,'' Mr. Tawfik said.</p>
        <p>Ayman Abdel-Moneim, the Culture Ministry's archaeologist in charge of the preservation project, said there were no plans to relocate residents of the neighborhood, although he did want to move incompatible businesses.</p>
        <p>''The program is to restore the monuments, the housing of the people, the infrastructure and the ground itself,'' he said. ''People must believe us as the government. They are not going to be moved out of historic Cairo.''</p>
        <p>Some longtime occupants said they wanted to believe the restoration would improve their lot. But sometimes they, too, have their doubts.</p>
        <p>''Come here and clean this up!'' shouted one tentmaker this week, as workers sent a cloud of plaster and dust from their construction site onto the street in front of his shop. When the workers studiously ignored his command, he pulled out a broom from behind a sewing table and set about cleaning up himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ali would like to think that the neighborhood could again be a quiet, friendly place, as it is portrayed in the Naguib Mahfouz books. Not that Mr. Ali has read them. ''I don't have to,'' he said. ''I live them.''</p>
        <p>He said he is reassured by the fact that the government is not tearing down the old buildings in Tentmakers Street, but only fixing them up.</p>
        <p>''If they destroyed them, I'm sure it would only be a matter of time before they'd move me out of here and tell me I had to go live somewhere in a new part of Cairo,'' he said. ''If that happened, they would be tearing me from my own heritage.''</p>
