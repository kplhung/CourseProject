        <p>Eating lunch or dinner on the run usually means settling for a burger or a hot dog on the street, but there are better options. Here are a dozen places that serve food fast and tasty. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. Bulgin' Waffles</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 477-6555</p>
        <p>49 1/2 First Avenue, near Third Street</p>
        <p>East Village</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This spare corner restaurant, which resembles a coffeehouse in an American college town, serves wonderful waffles. The namesake Bulgin' Waffle, the kind you might find in Belgium, is indeed big and thick, yet airy and fluffy. Even better are the smaller buckwheat wafflettes, exquisitely light and crisp, with more flavor than the big white-flour waffles. You won't find those in Belgium, which is Belgium's loss.</p>

        <p>2. Elvie's Turo-Turo</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 473-7785</p>
        <p>214 First Avenue, near 13th Street</p>
        <p>East Village</p>
        <p>$ Visa and Mastercard</p>
        <p>At Elvie's, a tiny storefront Filipino restaurant near Beth Israel Hospital, the day's selections are set out on a steam table, buffet style. The name Turo-Turo is a traditional restaurant term in the Philippines meaning ''point, point,'' and that's exactly what you do. With more than a dozen selections, primarily beef and pork with occasional chicken and fish dishes, this is not light cuisine. Adobo, tender chunks of marinated pork, is the national dish of the Philippines and always good, as are pancit, stir-fried rice noodles served with bits of chicken and vegetables. For dessert, point to sweet cassava cake.</p>
        <p>3. F&amp;B</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(646) 486-4441</p>
        <p>269 West 23rd Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>F&amp;B is a sleek storefront decorated in soothing pastels with pleasant lighting. The name stands for frites and beignets, but hot dogs are the centerpiece, including the excellent Great Dane, a slender red Danish sausage with bright snap to it. It is eaten just as it is in Denmark, on a roll with frizzled onions, marinated cucumbers, mustard, ketchup and remoulade. It sounds like a lot, but it's an easy mouthful, especially compared with the Top Dog, a plumper German-style sausage topped with tame sauerkraut and crumbled bacon. Frites are crisp and savory, and for 50 cents extra they are served with toppings including aioli, blue cheese and truffle oil.</p>
        <p>4. Fresco Tortilla Grill</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 475-7380</p>
        <p>36 Lexington Avenue, near 24th Street</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The soft tacos are remarkably good at this tiny storefront takeout shop, and the prices are remarkably low. The taco al carbon, tender sliced steak wrapped in a soft tortilla, is simple and delicious, as are the tacos with ground chorizo, black beans and chili con carne. Quesadillas, fajitas and sincronizadas, which are like sandwiches made with two tortillas held together by melted Monterey Jack cheese and various fillings, are also good. Fresco has been so successful that it has a legion of branches and imitators too numerous to list, all named Fresco Tortilla, Fresco Taco, Fresh Tortilla or some other variant.</p>
        <p>5. Knodel</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 986-1230</p>
        <p>Grand Central Terminal, Dining level</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Christer Larsson, the owner of Christer's on West 55th Street in Manhattan, recently opened Knodel, a kiosk that treats American-style sausages with European veneration. Mr. Larsson's restaurant is Scandinavian, but his sausages are American, served like hot dogs on fresh potato rolls with assorted toppings, though derived from the European tradition of creative sausage making. The fine Knodel brat, for example, is mostly savory pork, with pureed fig for a bit of sweetness and softer texture and, surprise, pine nuts, which fit in perfectly. Knodel also serves an excellent smoky, spicy andouille and a sweet and smoky chicken-and-apple sausage. Sides include sesame-scented Asian slaw, with red cabbage, carrots and raisins.</p>
        <p>6. Mama's Food Shop</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 777-4425</p>
        <p>200 East Third Street, at Avenue B</p>
        <p>East Village</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>Mama's is a simple place with home-style American cooking and room for no more than 20 people. You go to the counter and point at what you want, and it is dished up. The main courses are mostly meat dishes, and they are fine, like moist, savory meatloaf, flavorful grilled salmon and fried chicken. But the vegetable side dishes really shine. Brussels sprouts, split and charred and flavored with garlic, have rarely tasted so good. Carrots and beets are sliced thin and roasted until they are bursting with sweetness. And Mama's mashed potatoes are ethereal.</p>
        <p>7. Mee Noodle Shop And Grill</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 888-0027</p>
        <p>922 Second Avenue, at 49th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ American Express</p>
        <p>This branch of Mee, one of two in Manhattan, shows how good simple Chinese food can be when prepared with care and attention. Mee excels with noodles, offering seven kinds. Two of the best are lo mein with paper-thin slices of red-edged roast pork, and chicken mee fun, a cloud of rice noodles served with chicken breast and soy sauce. Warning: portions are huge. The other branch is at 219 First Avenue, at 13th Street, in the East Village.</p>
        <p>8. Miss Mamie's Spoonbread Too</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 865-6744</p>
        <p>366 West 110th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ Visa and Mastercard</p>
        <p>Miss Mamie's offers simple down-home Southern food based on recipes from the book ''Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine,'' by the owner, Norma Jean Darden, and her sister, Carole Darden Lloyd. While Miss Mamie's is largely a takeout operation, you are welcome to sit with your food at one of the room's pleasant yellow tables as long as you don't mind plastic utensils and plastic-foam containers. This is rich, hearty food, and as at most Southern restaurants, you get plenty of it; each entree comes with two large side dishes. The best selections are the meat dishes, like wonderfully tender short ribs of beef and sweet yet peppery barbecued North Carolina pork ribs. Side dishes are all fine as well.</p>
        <p>9. Naples 45</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 972-7001</p>
        <p>200 Park Avenue (entrance on 45th Street between Lexington and  Vanderbilt Avenues)</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Naples 45, at the north end of Grand Central Terminal, is large, loud and reasonably priced. The food is cooked with imagination and presented with heart, just as you'd want to see in a fast-paced Italian spot. The menu includes a wide selection of pizzas sized for individuals or for groups, and little bites like calamari salad, vegetable croquettes with goat cheese, grilled octopus salad, and grilled sausage with peppers. Naples 45 also serves pasta and main courses.</p>
        <p>10. Ruben's Empanadas</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 334-3351</p>
        <p>505 Broome Street</p>
        <p>SoHo</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>From Jamaican meat patties to Cornish pasties, meat-filled pastries are found the world over. Empanadas are the South American version. Ruben's, a trim, clean storefront, is just right for grabbing a quick meal. A couple of empanadas, perfectly turned crusts that are crisp around the edges and plump with spicy chicken, savory Argentine sausage or other fillings, make a fine fast lunch.</p>
        <p>11. Rue des Crepes</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 242-9900</p>
        <p>104 Eighth Avenue, near 15th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>In recent years, crepes have been associated more with kitschy French-American restaurants of the 1950's than with French street food, and Rue des Crepes does little to remedy that. The little dining room resembles a cobblestone Left Bank street by way of Disney World, complete with street signs and other contrived cues. But it matters little because the crepes are very good. Savory combinations, wrapped in soft buckwheat crepes, include merguez sausage with white beans and garlic, and chewy flank steak with caramelized onions. Or try one of the sweet fillings, like Nutella and banana, and the simple lemon and butter wrapped in white-flour crepes. You won't think you're in Paris, but you won't think you're in the 50's anymore, either.</p>
        <p>12. Soul Fixins'</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 736-1345</p>
        <p>371 West 34th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>If you like, you can pull up a chair at Soul Fixins' if any of the dozen or so seats are available in this small storefront near Ninth Avenue. But this kind of Southern food travels well, and it's nice to be able to spread out in comfort at home, especially with a dish like meaty barbecued spareribs bathed in a gloriously smoky sauce that requires you to towel down afterward. The crisp fried chicken is superior to chicken smothered in an oniony brown sauce. Side dishes (two come with each main course) are uniformly good, from the collard greens and green beans, each in a tangy vinegar sauce, to the candied yams, with clove and nutmeg.</p>
