        <p>DONOVAN-John Timothy, M.D. Native of Brooklyn, resident of Tenafly, N.J. for 45 years. Died at home August 17, 2000 of cancer. Patron of the arts, protector of nature. His enthusiasm, intellect and love of life inspired all who knew him. He was Assistant Attending Urologist at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and held private practice there for 36 years. After retiring, he became Adjunct Professor at Fairleigh Dickinson's New College, where he taught world history-his life-long passion-from 1990 to the present. As Captain in U.S. Armed Forces, he headed a MASH unit in Germany from 1950 to 1952. In 1970, he volunteered at the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Haiti. In 1973, he researched, in Germany, the revolutionary Electrohydraulic Lithotriptor, which disintegrated bladder stones, and introduced this less invasive procedure to the U.S. and Mexico. His media appearances helped launch widespread use of the technique. In the mid 70's, he hosted the radio show ''Medical Horizons'' on WFDU-FM. Survived by his wife Eileen (nee McAllister) of 51 years, his six children, Timothy, Anthony, Sean, Moira, Duane and Tate, his daughters-inlaw Karen and Mary, son-in-law, Chip Allee, and 4 grandchildren, Ari, Marnika, Kyrie and Lia. Wake at Barrett Funeral Home, 148 Dean Drive, Tenafly, N.J. Monday, August 21st 2-4 and 7-9PM. Funeral Mass at Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Tenafly, Tuesday, 11AM. In lieu of flowers, send donations to Hope House Ministries, POB 358, Port Jefferson NY 11777 or Englewood Hospice, 75 Demarest Ave, Englewood, New Jersey 07631.</p>
