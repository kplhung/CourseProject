        <p>IF the lights even flicker, much less flicker out, everybody blames Richie (oh, the stress of burnout by blackout). If the hurricane comes, everybody will blame, even hate, poor Richie (oh, the nightmares he has). And if the electric rates go up, everybody on Long Island gets to blame, perhaps even picket, our man Richie (oh, he says, the irony).</p>
        <p>It's the payback Richard M. Kessel, 50, gets for abandoning his niche as Nassau County's first and fiercest consumer advocate -- the Long Island Railroad, Lilco and the dastardly Shoreham nuclear plant all succumbed, in degrees, to his rabble-rousing charms -- so that he could squeeze into the top management position at the Long Island Power Authority. The shoe is on the other foot, and sometimes the advocate-turned-energy-czar hollers ''Ouch.''</p>

        <p>IF the lights even flicker, much less flicker out, everybody blames Richie (oh, the stress of burnout by blackout). If the hurricane comes, everybody will blame, even hate, poor Richie (oh, the nightmares he has). And if the electric rates go up, everybody on Long Island gets to blame, perhaps even picket, our man Richie (oh, he says, the irony).</p>
        <p>It's the payback Richard M. Kessel, 50, gets for abandoning his niche as Nassau County's first and fiercest consumer advocate -- the Long Island Railroad, Lilco and the dastardly Shoreham nuclear plant all succumbed, in degrees, to his rabble-rousing charms -- so that he could squeeze into the top management position at the Long Island Power Authority. The shoe is on the other foot, and sometimes the advocate-turned-energy-czar hollers ''Ouch.''</p>
        <p>And for this, the burly baby boomer who runs the third largest municipal utility company in the nation pockets a piddling $125,000 per year (he keeps reminding his doubtful dad that it sure beats last year's $88,000), no stock options included. There is no stock, are no dividends, and, according to Mr. Kessel, there are no secrets at the publicly owned LIPA, the $2 billion firm that drove a stake into the heart of the hated Lilco three years ago and took over as power supplier to more than a million customers. Good thing he banked those bar mitzvah savings bonds.</p>
        <p>''I haven't got a portfolio; I am my portfolio,'' says the corpulent Mr. Kessel. A sports nut, he invests his salary in season tickets for the Knicks and Giants, not dot-com schemes; would rather listen to the ranters on WFAN than noodle around with Nasdaq. He's got no kids, just four cats to keep in kibble at his new house (centrally air-conditioned but pool-less) in his hometown, Merrick.</p>
        <p>What he does have is the responsibility (''Awesome!'') of keeping Long Island, and the energy guzzlers, himself included, who live on it, plugged in and tuned in to a harsh fact of life: unless they wise up and endorse LIPA's attempts to expand (new power plants and pipelines) and innovate (windmills, fuel cells, solar panels), something very unpleasant may happen when they switch on their air-conditioners next summer, or the one after that. As in, nothing will happen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel, a kinetic guy despite his Santa-size heft, actually bounces in his chair as he tells it like is: ''We're gonna need to add some new power plants and some new transmission lines to Long Island in the next three or four years or we're gonna go dark, no question about it.''</p>
        <p>He insists that's not an idle threat but in the cards for consumers who take energy -- whether the bills come from LIPA or Con Ed -- for granted. And everybody, blurts Mr. Kessel, does: ''Anyone you ask says they want to be energy efficient, but no one really does it! No one wants a power plant, no one wants a windmill, no one wants a fuel cell, but we all want our pools and computers and air conditioners,'' he scolds. ''You can't have it both ways.''</p>
        <p>Come on, people. He's got to have those three windmills at Montauk Point (''They're symbolic!''), that pair of underwater transmission cables from New England to the Island, maybe even a nice, normal power plant next door to the shell that was Shoreham. He's doing it for you! And doing it because his boss, the governor (Mr. Kessel switched allegiance from his mentor, Mario Cuomo, to George E. Pataki when the political winds blew that way) calls it the appropriate thing to do.</p>
        <p>Those nonfossil fuel alternatives? He and the governor ''love 'em.'' If invested in now, they could supply 10 to 15 percent of the Island's energy within 10 years, trust him on this.</p>
        <p>Whew. Mr. Kessel (call him Richie, everybody does) takes this job seriously. You don't help kill a $5.5 billion plant like Shoreham and just walk away. ''Shoreham made my career,'' he concedes. ''Shoreham was Lilco's Titanic. When Hurricane Gloria hit, the people of Long Island said, 'Holy crapola! If they can't deal with a hurricane, how the heck are they gonna deal with a nuclear accident?' '' And if a major hurricane hits during Mr. Kessel's tenure? ''Boy-oh-boy, are we not prepared. But there's a part of me that wants to take us through the emergency.''</p>
        <p>He doesn't always take himself so seriously: check out that photograph of him supplying backup vocals for the Beach Boys on ''Barbara Ann'' at Jones Beach. Or crooning away with Jay and The Americans on ''Cara Mia''(Richie, you're dating yourself here) at the Westbury Music Fair.</p>
        <p>Time for a cookie break. ''I'm a chocaholic,'' he explains. And a workaholic? On call 24 hours a day, seven days a week; afraid to vacation out-of-state for fear the hurricane, the heat wave, the whatever, will violate his turf (and reputation) the minute he leaves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel, an only child whose mother's death from cancer in 1972 ''floored'' him and caused him to scrap law school for politics, made a State Senate run in 1974. His platform was ''Say No To Lilco.'' He lost, but refused to quit badgering Lilco.</p>
        <p>He says he never imagined that LIPA, once it decommissioned Shoreham, would paint its initials over Lilco's trucks, never imagined a boisterous consumer advocate would land the CEO seat. A sellout? His ruddy face looks hurt.</p>
        <p>''I don't see this as being a utility executive,'' he says. ''I'm a public official. Being the chairman of LIPA is like being the county executive of both counties. I think it's one of the most important jobs on Long Island. Because hey, without electricity, nothing works.''</p>
