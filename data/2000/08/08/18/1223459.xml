        <p>A 7,500-pound spool of electrical cable being lowered into a Manhattan subway station yesterday suddenly broke loose and barreled down the stairs of the station, leaving one woman in critical condition and another with several injuries, officials said.</p>
        <p>The accident happened about 11:45 a.m.  at the 14th Street and Eighth Avenue station. Workers for Sheldon Electric, a subcontractor for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, had left half of the stairway open, allowing passengers to use it as workers lowered the spool on the other side, which had been taped off, said Bob Slovak, a transit authority spokesman.</p>
        <p>The one-inch thick nylon rope that held the spool snapped, he said, and the spool,  which had reached only the third step, went rolling down the stairs with enough force to destroy the metal banisters, bouncing off a wall and then hitting the women, Mr. Slovak said.</p>
        <p>The women, Andresa Kippins, 73, of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Blanca Valentin, 40, of the Bronx, were badly hurt, said a spokeswoman for St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center, where the victims were taken. .</p>
        <p>Ms. Kippins's son David said his mother told him that she and Ms. Valentin, who did not know each other, had stopped at the foot of the stairs when they saw the spool, about five feet in diameter, being lowered. But his mother was assured by workers that she could proceed, Mr. Kippins said.</p>
        <p>''The guy waved to them and said it was O.K. to pass,'' Mr. Kippins said. ''And the next thing they knew, it broke and this thing came at them.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Valentin had almost reached the landing when she looked up and saw the giant wheel of cable in front of her, she said last night from her bed, where she was recuperating. She left the hospital at about 5:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>''I'm angry about it,'' she said. Though she was knocked down the stairs, she said, she was not hit as hard as Ms. Kippins, who was left with a bone jutting out of her leg.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kippins suffered several broken bones, including the fibula and the tibia of one leg, three ribs, her collarbone and her pelvis, Mr. Kippins said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Valentin, who had been on her way to work at a soup restaurant on 16th Street and Ninth Avenue, said she did not suffer any broken bones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kippins said he was astonished at the lack of safety precautions. ''How could they just have men holding a rope? Why didn't they have a crane lowering something like that? It was 7,500 pounds.''</p>
        <p>Sheldon Electric, which has been in business for 80 years and is based in Maspeth, Queens, had not notified the transit company of its plan to use a ''muscle operation'' to lower the spool, Mr. Slovak said. ''If they had, we would have had them close off this staircase completely when the cable was being lowered,'' he said. ''We would have directed people away from the area.''</p>
        <p>Sheldon Electric was working for CAB Associates, the main contractor for the $15 million renovation of the subway station, which is served by the A, C, E and L trains. The renovation began in 1994, but Sheldon has been working for the transit system for at least a decade, a city official said. Sheldon is owned by a company called Railworks.</p>
        <p>Sheldon has faced questions about  safety issues before, the official said.</p>
        <p>''They have had other safety issues in which they at least had to be talked to about the problems,'' the official said. ''I don't know if there were any penalties involved.''</p>
        <p>Michael Cahn, the chief executive of Sheldon, said he did not know whether the company had notified M.T.A. that it was going to lower the spool manually. He did not provide more details about the incident.</p>
        <p>''The nature of it is such that my attorney would probably tell me not to say anything about this, and that's easy because I really do not know what happened,'' Mr. Cahn said last night.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kippins was to have surgery last night, her son said yesterday. A retired first-grade teacher, she had been on her way to a class with other retired teachers in which she was learning to play the recorder, a flute-like instrument, her son said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kippins's daughter-in-law, Dorothy Kippins, said, ''She's a very active lady.''</p>
