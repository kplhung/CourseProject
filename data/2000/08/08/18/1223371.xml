        <p>They are still puffing up their chests about last year's preseason scrum and wincing over the regular-season shellacking. But the Jets are approaching tonight's game against the Giants like self-absorbed teenagers. Forget about them, the Jets say. It's all about us.</p>
        <p>The pileup spurred by Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead and Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde during last year's preseason game is so far in the past that it provokes a few chuckles now.

        <p>They are still puffing up their chests about last year's preseason scrum and wincing over the regular-season shellacking. But the Jets are approaching tonight's game against the Giants like self-absorbed teenagers. Forget about them, the Jets say. It's all about us.</p>
        <p>The pileup spurred by Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead and Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde during last year's preseason game is so far in the past that it provokes a few chuckles now. And even though receiver Wayne Chrebet said the Jets would like to ''save some face'' after their dismal 41-28 loss to the Giants in Week 13 of the regular season, the real purpose of this game is not to add any more fuel to a rivalry that is already intense.</p>
        <p>For the Jets, it is the final preseason game, an opportunity to delve deeper into their summer of self-discovery. The schedule did them a favor by allowing them to complete all four preseason games before the first roster cuts must be made Tuesday, and the Jets want to take full advantage. The Giants are merely another foil, albeit a more familiar and more heated one, in this editing process.</p>
        <p>Whether Testaverde plays with his injured toe tonight is almost beside the point. If, after seeing how Testaverde's toe responds following two consecutive days of practice, the Jets choose caution, Testaverde is experienced enough to get himself ready for the season opener during the next two weeks of practice. Others do not have the luxury of time. With Coach Al Groh having to make difficult roster decisions soon, the Jets will devote much of this game to taking a last look at what they have.</p>
        <p>''We're playing it like it's the fourth preseason game,'' Groh said. ''You can't coach to your ego, because your ego says you want every play to be perfect and you want to win every preseason game. You can do that, but you may not have found out a lot about your players.''</p>
        <p>The most compelling competition is among the wide receivers. Through three games and a month of camp, nobody has taken a firm grasp on the third receiver spot. And although Groh said Chrebet and Dedric Ward are his starters until somebody else shows he can play better, Ward has done little to lock up the second receiver's spot. He has won the role by experience and default as much as anything else.</p>
        <p>Vincent Brisby, the new addition from New England, should have a smooth transition. He should already be familiar with the offense, having seen the same plays with the Patriots for the last eight months as he will with the Jets. Brisby, who is 6 feet 3 inches and 200 pounds, said Wednesday that he expected to have a shot at the starting job, and his size may make him a better complement to Chrebet than the short but speedy Ward.</p>
        <p>The signing of Brisby makes this a crucial game for Yatil Green as well. He did not play in two of the first three games and has not caught a pass. Groh, who loathes injury talk, has been cool to Green, who spoke at length when he arrived about his copious knee operations and the difficulty he has getting out of bed in the morning. While he has performed well in recent practices -- making circus catches and showing flashes of speed remarkable for someone with his injury history -- Brisby's arrival is a sure sign that Green has to make a big impression tonight or find himself gone by Tuesday.</p>
        <p>And the rookies Laveranues Coles and Windrell Hayes, who have been erratic during camp on offense and special teams, have a final chance to make their bid to be the third receiver.</p>
        <p>''Every day, they come along a little further,'' Chrebet said. ''They're not getting the time, with myself and Dedric in there, that some draft picks might get. They know the plays, it's just a matter of getting into a game and carrying it over from practice. At some point, they're both going to have to do something, on special teams or on offense.''</p>
        <p>At left end, the rookie Shaun Ellis will probably start again, in the Jets' continuing effort to drill enough repetitions into him to make their first draft pick a starter in time for the season opener. Groh was not sure Ellis would start at right end, because he would like to give 20 plays to a number of candidates, including the free agent signees Shane Burton and Anthony Cook. Rick Lyle started there last week.</p>
        <p>And Groh's rotation at free safety has rolled back around to Omar Stoutmire. He will start this game, after each of the three contenders -- Stoutmire, Kevin Williams and Scott Frost -- each started one of the first three games without any of the three grabbing the job. To observers, Stoutmire seems to have played the best during training camp, but Groh says he is not leaning toward any of the three yet.</p>
        <p>''I want another game,'' Groh said. ''I hope somebody will give me a push in one direction.''</p>
