        <p>Biogen Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., and the Elan Corporation, a Dublin-based pharmaceutical company, announced a partnership yesterday to develop and sell Elan's drug Antegren. The drug has shown promise in treating multiple sclerosis, a crippling nerve disease, and the digestive disorder Crohn's disease. The two companies will share revenue from the product, as well as research and marketing costs. In tests, the drug has worked well as a complement to Biogen's existing multiple sclerosis treatment, Avonex. The companies said Antegren might be useful in treating a range of diseases. Elan's American depository receipts jumped more than 10 percent, gaining $5.875 each, to $59.875. Biogen was up 25 cents, to $70.50.</p>
