        <p>The entrepreneurs of the Sulu Sea are on to their biggest deal yet, and like deal-making anywhere, the last-minute bargaining appears to be intense.</p>
        <p>The business is kidnapping and the deal involves nine Western vacationers and four local workers who were seized by Muslim rebels from an island diving resort nearly four months ago.</p>
        <p>The Westerners were to have been released today in exchange for a payment that could reach several million dollars, but something has caused a delay. Officially, the reason is weather, but local officials say the real snag seems to involve money.</p>
        <p>Awaiting release are two Germans, two South Africans, two Finns, two French citizens and a French-Lebanese woman as well as three Malaysians and a Filipino from the diving resort. Three French television journalists who trekked in to interview the hostages are also being held, as well as a dozen evangelical Christians who said they wanted to pray with them and may in fact have remained voluntarily.</p>
        <p>[Agence France-Presse reported that the Malaysians were released Friday morning as negotiations continued for the other captives.]</p>
        <p>The release has been brokered by Libya, which has sent a plane to fly the captives to Tripoli before they are sent home, and local reports say the Libyans are prepared to give the hostage-takers millions of dollars in what is being described as development aid.</p>
        <p>But prospects for smooth negotiations cannot have been helped by the comments today of Ricardo Puno, a spokesman for President Joseph Estrada, who said: ''Once this matter is resolved, and it will be resolved sooner or later, the government is going to take certain actions against them. They're not going to have an easy life after this.''</p>
        <p>Already the tiny island of Jolo, in a remote area that for centuries has been home to pirates and roaming brigands, is awash in cash from a dozen earlier releases. The thatched villages and jungle-covered mountains have come alive with gem dealers and gunrunners, and the 1,000-peso note -- worth $22 and rarely seen outside the country's major cities -- has become common currency.</p>
        <p>The Philippine military says as much as $5.5 million in ransom has already been paid to the kidnappers, a Muslim rebel group numbering only a few hundred. From among the original hostages a German woman, six Malaysian resort workers and several other captives were released after separate deals were struck.</p>
        <p>With those payments, the group, calling itself Abu Sayyaf and claiming to be fighting for a separate Muslim state, has entered the big time in the area's kidnapping industry. The usual going rate, local officials say, is $5,000 per hostage.</p>
        <p>Philippine government policy bars the payment of ransoms, so the payments for hostages are generally described as ''room and board.'' But little of the money paid so far seems to have been spent on accommodations for the current group.</p>
        <p>According to reporters who have visited them, they have been fed a skimpy diet of rice and sardines and have slept on the ground. Through their visitors they have sent out periodic messages of anger and despair.</p>
        <p>As kidnappings go, this one has been notably value-added. Since the original 21 people were seized on April 23 from the Malaysian diving resort of Sipadan -- a short speedboat ride from the islands of the southern Philippines -- a dozen news reporters have been captured and released. When 10 European journalists were seized in June, their editors paid $25,000 for their freedom in what they described as a ''gift'' in return for their interviews.</p>
        <p>Others who managed to get out after interviewing the hostages were stripped of their watches, tape recorders, cameras and sometimes shoes. According to other journalists, a number of reporters paid cash for their safe passage. Indeed, some officials here say that one reason for the current delay involves negotiations for the freedom of the three French television journalists.</p>
        <p>In his comments today, Mr. Puno said, ''The government is concerned about this kind of thing becoming a continuing activity.''</p>
        <p>But there seemed to be little it could do to halt the long-established kidnapping industry, in which gunmen disappear into the local population once they have received payment.</p>
        <p>Jolo island is now a battleground filled with thousands of frustrated Philippine soldiers who have been able to take little action as long as the hostages are held.</p>
        <p>''It's very clear that in the last couple of years they have stepped up their kidnapping activities basically as a fund-raising exercise,'' Mr. Puno said.</p>
        <p>Now, with millions to spend, Abu Sayyaf could become a real military force.</p>
