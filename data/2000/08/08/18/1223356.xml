        <p>A federal bankruptcy judge set aside a Federal Trade Commission plan today limiting the ability of an online toy retailer to sell its customer database as part of its liquidation.</p>
        <p>The company, Toysmart.com, reached a settlement with the commission last month meant to address concerns over the sale of data that had been collected with the promise of confidentiality.</p>
        <p>But the judge, Carol Kenner, said today that in the absence of a buyer, the commission's action was premature. ''I believe that deciding this in a vacuum, without a real-live bidder here, is unnecessary,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She took the action ''without prejudice,'' meaning that the trade commission and others are welcome to renew their concerns and objections once a bid and specific terms have been put forward for approval.</p>
        <p>''The function of any court is to resolve actual conflicts,'' the judge added, noting that complaints about potential abuse of the information were based on hypothetical concerns rather than specific details.</p>
        <p>Dana Rosenfeld, assistant director of the trade commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said, ''obviously we're disappointed'' by the ruling, but said the judge had not rejected ''the basic premise'' of the commission's position.</p>
        <p>Toysmart.com had pledged not to sell its customer information to third parties, but its bankruptcy prompted concerns that the data would be sold as part of its assets. The trade commission voted 3 to 2 last month in favor of a settlement restricting the sale of the database. Under those terms, the buyer would have to be in a family-related commerce market,  purchase the entire Web site and agree not to resell the data without permission from the individuals who submitted it.</p>
        <p>Some commission members, state attorneys general and privacy advocates opposed the settlement, saying it did not go far enough.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Toysmart.com and its creditors withdrew the company's Web site and customer list last month after rejecting two offers, including one of $50,000 from a unit of the Walt Disney Company, the majority owner of Toysmart.com, which pledged to destroy the list.</p>
        <p>The creditors contended in court today that the commission's terms unduly constrained efforts to find a potential buyer.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately, the resolution will be crafted around the buyer,'' said Christopher Panos, attorney for the creditors, who urged the judge not to approve the trade commission's plan. He said the company ''cannot do anything with this asset without giving notice to the F.T.C. and the approval of bankruptcy court.''</p>
        <p>Sales of the company's other assets since its shutdown in May have yielded more than $5 million, more than initially expected, said Harry Murphy, bankruptcy attorney for Toysmart.com. He blamed ''adverse publicity'' from the company's June attempt to market its customer lists for the shortage of bidders.</p>
        <p>''No one wanted to walk into a lawsuit,'' he said. ''Now we're back where we started.''</p>
        <p>Judge Kenner gave no deadline for Toysmart.com to find a buyer.</p>
        <p>Other bankrupt dot-com companies have sold their customer data, though Craftshop.com, an arts and crafts retailer, also withdrew its list from sale last month. The presence of information about minors among the 250,000 individuals in Toysmart's database make its case unique, legal experts say.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the buyer, Toysmart.com customers need to be advised that such details as children's names, ages and toy preferences might be transferred, argued Pamela Kogut, assistant attorney general for Massachusetts. Given the specific promise of not sharing that data with any third parties, customers should be given the choice of whether to remain on the list or not, she said.</p>
