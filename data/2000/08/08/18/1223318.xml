        <p>Ask a child to choose between a day at a museum and a day at an amusement park, and it's not hard to guess which will win. But this summer the New York area offers a place where thrills don't come at the expense of intellectual stimulation, or vice versa.</p>
        <p>It's the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, where several exhibitions explore the physics of fun. At ''Scream Machines: The Science of Roller Coasters,'' older children and adults can try for a moment of weightlessness. The intrepid visitor (I was not one) is strapped into a bicycle that is attached, like a pendulum, to the center of a huge upright wheel. As the person pedals, he or she can gain enough centrifugal force to ride the bike all the way around the wheel's inner rim. The reward is the excitement of free fall: at the top of the loop, the human force briefly cancels that of gravity.</p>

        <p>Ask a child to choose between a day at a museum and a day at an amusement park, and it's not hard to guess which will win. But this summer the New York area offers a place where thrills don't come at the expense of intellectual stimulation, or vice versa.</p>
        <p>It's the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, where several exhibitions explore the physics of fun. At ''Scream Machines: The Science of Roller Coasters,'' older children and adults can try for a moment of weightlessness. The intrepid visitor (I was not one) is strapped into a bicycle that is attached, like a pendulum, to the center of a huge upright wheel. As the person pedals, he or she can gain enough centrifugal force to ride the bike all the way around the wheel's inner rim. The reward is the excitement of free fall: at the top of the loop, the human force briefly cancels that of gravity.</p>
        <p>For younger fans and their faint-of-heart parents, there are tamer exhibits, like a ride simulator. While you wait in line, you can examine a display explaining the mechanics of motion sickness, complete with a transparent glass-enclosed figure that will graphically demonstrate the process. (I was relieved that it was broken on the day we visited.)</p>
        <p>Thankfully, the simulator wasn't too harrowing. It involves sitting on a platform that pitches and lurches while you watch a movie filmed from the perspective of someone riding some very scary coasters.</p>
        <p>The littlest visitors can look at a miniature mechanical coaster and build their own models from interlocking segments. By rolling balls along the tracks, children can see how a properly engineered loop helps inertia overcome gravity.</p>
        <p>Outdoors (weather permitting), the center offers ''SkyCycle,'' a playground illustrating levers and balance. Those tall enough can ride the exhibition's namesake, a bicycle on a track 11 feet above the ground. (Physics keeps it firmly in place.)</p>
        <p>The display also has a huge seesaw, a limbo bar, a simulated tightrope and a toddler's favorite introduction to the law of gravity: a slide.</p>
        <p>The final stop for summer chills is the center's latest Imax movie, ''Thrill Ride: The Science of Fun.'' It investigates the technology not only of roller coasters but also of films' special effects, so be prepared to be swallowed by a Tyrannosaurus.</p>
        <p>''Scream Machines'' and ''Sky Cycle,'' through Sept. 4, and ''Thrill Ride,'' through Sept. 30, at the Liberty Science Center, Liberty State Park, Jersey City, (201) 200-1000. Hours through Sept. 4: daily, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission for exhibits and one Imax film: $13.50; the elderly and ages 2 to 18, $11.50.</p>
        <p>Joining Forces</p>
        <p>This weekend there will be a sea of blue all around the Intrepid Museum. Not unusual for a remodeled aircraft carrier, except that this ocean doesn't involve water. At the museum's second annual Police Appreciation Weekend, uniformed officers from a variety of units will show why they're called New York's Finest.</p>
        <p>''The event is intended to be very interactive,'' said Mark Albin, the museum's vice president for marketing and communications. ''Kids get to try on bulletproof vests, see all the equipment and pet the horses.''</p>
        <p>In fact, four-legged police will be among the stars. In addition to the horses, a German shepherd will assist in a simulated narcotics arrest and a bomb-detection exercise.</p>
        <p>The Highway Patrol Unit will feature a crash simulator, or ''convincer vehicle'': seeing a dummy hurled from it at only eight miles per hour is a strong incentive to use seat belts.</p>
        <p>The Police Museum will also take part, with displays of old photographs, night sticks, whistles and a rattle used to summon help in 1625. The Special Operations Division will show how officers patrol the sea and air as well as the land. Expect scuba gear, patrol boats, rescue equipment and an aviation team overhead.</p>
        <p>Police Appreciation Weekend, tomorrow and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, Pier 86, West 46th Street and 12th Avenue, Clinton, (212) 957-7055. Free.</p>
        <p>A Bug's Life</p>
        <p>With all the recent spraying for West Nile virus on Staten Island, you wouldn't think insects would be one of the borough's favorite topics. But Clay Wollney, the host of the Science Club at the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences, intends to show off the various good species as well as the bad and the ugly.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, in a program geared to 8- to 13-year-olds, Mr. Wollney will discuss insect anatomy with the help of some leggy (and live) models, like crickets, grasshoppers, butterflies and ladybugs. Mealworms, the larvae of the mealy beetle, will illustrate insect life cycles.</p>
        <p>''We'll probably use them for some behavioral experiments as well,'' Mr. Wollney said. ''We can test their preferences for light or dark, moist or dry.'' Children will be invited to handle the creatures as well as a paper wasps' nest -- a vacant one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wollney will emphasize the usefulness of some insects as pollinators and as pest terminators, ''but I'm certainly not going to be defending mosquitoes,'' he said. Still, bugs inspire a certain respect; compared with the insect kingdom, New York is a small town.</p>
        <p>''Insects make up close to 90 percent of all living animals,'' Mr. Wollney said. ''They're doing pretty well in terms of numbers.''</p>
        <p>Science Club, tomorrow at 10 a.m. at the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences, 75 Stuyvesant Place, St. George, (718) 727-1135, extension 29. Admission: in advance, $8; members, $5; at the door, $10; members, $7. Reservations advised.</p>
