        <p>Al Gore tried to accomplish a political feat so daunting tonight that even the maestro himself, President Clinton, might have had trouble pulling it off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore presented himself as his own man and virtually skated over his service as vice president as he sought to persuade the nation that he is more than the dutiful lieutenant. But he also tried to take credit for helping to bring about ''the biggest surpluses'' ever -- the grandest achievement of the Clinton era.</p>
        <p>He tried to shake the impressions of Americans who, in the words of his campaign chairman, think he is ''boring, stiff'' and ''unable to speak.'' But he also asserted that he would build a campaign based on the dry timber of issues rather than on the flash and dazzle of personality.</p>
        <p>He tried to embolden and excite liberals whose turnout are essential to his victory. But he also tried, though less aggressively, to embolden and excite moderate voters who are crucial to a victory in November -- and have shown an interest in Gov. George W. Bush of Texas that has alarmed Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's elaborate -- and often conflicting -- objectives tonight, and throughout this convention week, reflect the trying challenges he and the Democrats confront as they emerge from this convention. Forget the confetti and mirthful talk of harmony from the rostrum. For the Democrats, happy days are certainly not here again. They may not be panicked, but they are jittery about their standard-bearer. And they are jittery about November.</p>
        <p>''It will be a difficult campaign,'' said James Patrick Leahy, a delegate from Ohio, even after four days of enforced partisan cheerleading. ''Gore has one of those personalities you have to develop a relationship with.''</p>
        <p>The polls showing Mr. Gore behind, Mr. Leahy said, have dampened his enthusiasm. ''The polling has a psychological effect,'' he said. ''It's like when you go to the race track and look at the racing form and see your horse isn't supposed to do well.''</p>
        <p>There were no such worries when the Republicans concluded their political production in Philadelphia two weeks ago. At that convention, Dick Cheney, the vice presidential nominee, did not have to scurry from constituent group to constituent group with words of appeasement -- as Senator Joseph I. Lieberman did today, and the two days before.</p>
        <p>After eight years on the outside, even Republican delegates who were not pleased with the inclusive tone of their program were so desperate to return to power that it took little, if any, prodding to corral them behind Mr. Bush. Eight years ago, Democrats were also willing to put aside their differences in the name of the greater goal of helping Bill Clinton bring them back to power. Now, they are less accommodating.</p>
        <p>So the party tried to fire up the rank and file by jamming the stage this week with liberal icons like Senator Edward M. Kennedy and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and leaders of labor, abortion rights and gay rights groups. Even Mr. Lieberman, in his speech, retreated from his usual condemnation of the collapsed culture of Hollywood and instead played the partisan. And tonight, Mr. Gore aimed his message squarely at the party base -- and away from the broader messages of Mr. Clinton's two acceptance speeches -- by sounding traditional Democratic themes of abortion, affirmative action and government spending.</p>
        <p>More than one Democratic offical complained that the campaign this week seemed more focused on winning over the liberals who might back Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, than the bigger threat, Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''The Republicans played to the country -- the Democrats played to the hall,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ''Voters saw through the big tent Republican convention. They know it was staged. But they were thankful that somebody cared.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's address was carefully calibrated to offer a nod to the man with whom he has such a complicated relationship -- and to move on swiftly. In the 5,100-word text, the vice president mentioned Mr. Clinton only once, declaring, ''Millions of Americans will live better lives for a long time to come because of the job that's been done by President Bill Clinton.''</p>
        <p>He also, subtly, sought to put some distance between himself and a leader who had disappointed, if not embarrassed, the nation. ''I will never let you down,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The unknowing listener would not have a clue of what arguably makes Mr. Gore best prepared to be president: that he has served the past eight years as vice president. The thinking of Mr. Gore's campaign is that no matter how active a political partner he was, voters will never give a vice president credit.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is Al Gore. Whether it is his link to the scandals of Mr. Clinton, the unfavorable comparisons to the more politically adroit president -- or simply his personality -- Democrats here are just not as enamored of their new nominee. On this day four years ago, even the bombshell that Mr. Clinton's top strategist was having an affair with a call girl did nothing to disrupt -- and maybe added a little spice -- to the week of lock-step partisan harmony behind the president.</p>
        <p>Hours before his boss was to deliver the most consequential speech of his political career, one of Mr. Gore's top aides confessed that he was worried because the campaign was still roiled by squabbling factions. ''Bill Daley has not gotten the warlords under control yet,'' this campaign official said, referring to William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman.</p>
        <p>It was no accident, certainly, that Mr. Gore spewed out lots of policy tonight. He was trying to make the case that ''people deserve to know specifically what a candidate proposes to do.''</p>
        <p>Mindful of polls showing that the public gives Democrats higher marks than Republicans on a range of issues, Mr. Gore's aides said they hope the campaign can be fought on that terrain.</p>
        <p>Before he can do that, Mr. Gore wants to neutralize Governor Bush's biggest advantage -- his appealing personality. That explains that footage in a film tonight lauding Mr. Gore for his Frankenstein disguise during a Halloween party. That is why all week Democrats, and the candidate himself, offered testaments to the fuzzy and decidedly un-vice presidential side of Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore made only glancing blows at the Republicans and he did not directly cite his opponent by name even once. But clearly acknowleding that Mr. Bush had the edge on charm, Mr. Gore said, ''The presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a day-by-day fight for people. Sometimes, you have to chose to do what's difficult or unpopular. Sometimes you have to be willing to spend your popularity in order to pick the hard right over the easy wrong.''</p>
        <p>Even then-Vice President George Bush, in his acceptance speech in New Orleans in 1988, did not face the difficulties of Mr. Gore. He, too, had the unfortunate fate of having to stand on his own after eight years in the shadow of a far more dexterous political performer. But Mr. Bush  never had such trouble untangling himself from Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>The symbolic transfer of political power was far smoother in 1988 when Mr. Reagan put forth a dignified and full-throated pitch for his No. 2. This week, Mr. Clinton was criticized for not making more of an energetic case for Mr. Gore in his speech here on Monday -- or in their joint appearance in Michigan the next day. The rub is that had he been more generous in his praise, Mr. Clinton might have been accused of injecting himself too much into the role of star performer giving an assist to his understudy.</p>
        <p>In his speech tonight, Mr. Gore seemed to borrow a bit from the playbook of the man whose son is standing in his way to the White House. He addressed the personality issue head on, saying, ''If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be the most exciting politician.'' But in what could be interpreted as a dig at Mr. Bush -- who is known as less engaged on the issues than Mr. Gore -- he pledged, ''I will work for you every day.''</p>
        <p>Here's what Mr. Bush said in 1988: ''I may not be the most eloquent, but I learned that eloquence won't draw oil from the ground. I may sometimes be a little awkward, but there's nothing self-conscious in my love of country.''And, as Mr. Bush did 12 years ago, Mr. Gore sought to fasten himself to the economic successes of his administration.</p>
        <p>It could be that the appeal will work and, as happened with Mr. Bush, that people will entrust Mr. Gore to continue bringing the nation down the path of prosperity.</p>
        <p>But in a telling acknowledgment that the campaign ahead will not be easy, Mr. Gore's aides were already playing down the import of tonight.</p>
        <p>''This is an important moment, a crescendo,'' said Tad Devine, one of Mr. Gore's top strategists. '' But there will be other big moments in this campaign, including the presidential debates.''</p>
        <p>Sooner or later, though, Mr. Gore will run out of big moments. And tonight may have been his best opportunity to accomplish what he has tried again and again in this race for president: to reintroduce himself to the people.</p>
