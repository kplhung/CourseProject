        <p>More people watched the prime-time network television coverage of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's address to the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night than watched a similar vice-presidential address by the Republicans' nominee two weeks ago.</p>

        <p>Cheney, on the third night of his convention, was watched by an estimated 14.1 million network viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research data.</p>
        <p>But Wednesday night's network audience was smaller than the 16.5 million who watched Al Gore accept the nomination for vice president at the 1996 Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>The audiences for public television and cable were also larger on Night 3 of the Democratic convention than they were on that night of the Republican gathering.</p>
        <p>The coverage of Mr. Cheney's speech by PBS was watched by an estimated 2.5 million people. About 2.9 million people watched its coverage of Mr. Lieberman's address.</p>
        <p>Likewise, 2.1 million people were estimated to have watched Night 3 of the Republican convention on the Fox News Channel, CNN and MSNBC. Nearly 2.3 million watched Night 3 of the Democratic convention on those networks on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>CNN's prime-time audience on Wednesday was about 85 percent of what it was on the third night of the 1996 Democratic convention.</p>
