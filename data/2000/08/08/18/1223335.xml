        <p>Named after the Parisian square that is home to the Ritz Hotel, several haute couture boutiques and some of the world's most expensive jewelry shops, ''Place Vendome'' provides a perfect setting for Catherine Deneuve, herself one of the French cinema's most precious gems.</p>
        <p>Now 56, an age when most American actresses would have been shuffled off to play eccentric grandmothers in television movies, Ms. Deneuve remains a star of regal proportions. The face has filled out a tiny bit, the figure a bit more, but the piercing eyes and granite jaw remain as formidable as ever.</p>

        <p>Named after the Parisian square that is home to the Ritz Hotel, several haute couture boutiques and some of the world's most expensive jewelry shops, ''Place Vendome'' provides a perfect setting for Catherine Deneuve, herself one of the French cinema's most precious gems.</p>
        <p>Now 56, an age when most American actresses would have been shuffled off to play eccentric grandmothers in television movies, Ms. Deneuve remains a star of regal proportions. The face has filled out a tiny bit, the figure a bit more, but the piercing eyes and granite jaw remain as formidable as ever.</p>
        <p>In ''Place Vendome'' she is Marianne Malivert, the unhappy, alcoholic wife of a prominent jeweler (Bernard Fresson, a veteran who appeared with Ms. Deneuve back in  1967 in ''Belle de Jour''). Busy checking herself in and out of assorted clinics, Madame Malivert is too far gone to notice that her husband is facing bankruptcy. One night he brings home a pouch containing five exquisite diamonds, which he places in his wife's care; the next day, he kills himself by driving his car into a logging truck.</p>
        <p>The diamonds turn out to be stolen,  and soon the befogged Marianne finds herself besieged from all directions -- by representatives of the De Beers cartel, who believe the stones to have been taken from their stock; by her contemptuous brother-in-law (Francois Berleand), who needs the gems to save the family business; and by the mysterious Battistelli (Jacques Dutronc), a shady operator with connections to the Russian mafia.</p>
        <p>All of which proves to be immensely therapeutic for Marianne, who rises to the occasion by tossing out her bottles of Bordeaux and rediscovering the canny businesswoman she was before her marriage. Adding spice to the situation is the fact that in the distant past she and Battistelli were lovers, until he abandoned her to the police when one of his dubious deals went sour.</p>
        <p>It is not hard to imagine Lana Turner or Elizabeth Taylor playing Marianne in a high camp Hollywood melodrama of the late 1950's, but ''Place Vendome'' takes a more restrained approach. Though Ms. Deneuve is given plenty of opportunities to wear fabulous gowns while drifting through fabulous locations, the film is so darkly lighted (by the cinematographer Laurent Dailland) that it's often difficult to make out the details. The mood, nicely sustained by the director, Nicole Garcia, is one of muffled despair, world-weary resignation and faintly rekindled hopes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Garcia, herself a fine actress (in such films as Alain Resnais's 1980 ''Mon Oncle d'Amerique''), has now made three features as a writer-director (including ''Every Other Weekend'' in 1990 and ''Favorite Son'' in 1994), and she certainly knows how to frame a performance.</p>
        <p>The script of ''Place Vendome, '' which Ms. Garcia wrote with her usual collaborator, Jacques Fieschi, is filled with superfluous characters and strained coincidences -- Emmanuelle Seigner turns up as Battistelli's current lover, a salesgirl at the Malivert boutique, and Jean-Pierre Bacri is a disbarred lawyer with a romantic interest in Marianne. But despite its many flaws, the film never loses its focus on its fascinating central figure. Grandly suffering, grandly triumphant or just plain grand, Ms. Deneuve is a spectacle to behold.</p>
        <p>PLACE VENDOME</p>
