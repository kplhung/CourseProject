        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>AFGHANISTAN: TALIBAN BACKTRACK ON BAKERIES -- One day after the ruling Taliban shut down bakeries that employ widows and feed the poor, they reversed themselves and said that all 25 could reopen and the 360 women return to work. The Taliban, who rule roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan, espouse a harsh brand of Islamic law and have imposed strict controls on women since capturing the capital, Kabul, in 1996.</p>

        <p>IRAQ: READY FOR BUSINESS -- Baghdad's Saddam International Airport officially reopened, 10 years after it was closed because of sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But the only traffic the airport will have for the foreseeable future is likely to be limited to the arrival of private flights from abroad, which are not specifically banned by the embargo.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>LATVIA: DOWNTOWN BLASTS -- Two bombs exploded in a shopping center in downtown Riga, wounding 21 people, the police said. No one claimed responsibility, but Riga has had scores of bombings since Latvia regained independence in 1991, and the police have attributed most to gang activity.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: ROYAL PASSAGE -- Prince William, second in line to the British throne after his father, Prince Charles, has passed his final-year exams and will be attending St. Andrews, Scotland's oldest university. He plans to begin a four-year degree course in art history next year, after a year off. He is currently in Belize taking part in exercises with the Welsh Guards.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>COLOMBIA: POLICEMEN SLAIN -- The bodies of three policemen who had been taken prisoner by rebels 18 months ago were found with their throats slit after a clash between the army and rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. They were among more than 350 security force members the guerrilla group has captured over the last two years to try to pressure the government to release some 450 jailed rebels.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: BORDER CZAR -- President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada said that after he takes office in December, he will appoint a ''czar'' to help resolve border issues that have long strained relations between the United States and Mexico. A chief duty, he said, would be to promote greater cooperation between local governments on both sides of the border.</p>

        <p>CANADA: BOLSTERING THE RIGHT -- The new right-wing party, the Canadian Alliance, won another defection from its shrinking rival, the Progressive Conservative Party, as Brian Pallister, a former Manitoba cabinet minister, left the ranks of the old party, known as the Tories. Mr. Pallister, a former national Tory leadership candidate, said he would run for Parliament from Manitoba in elections expected next spring.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: WOMEN AT THE WHEEL -- Two women have became the first female drivers of the super-fast Shinkansen ''bullet'' trains. A spokesman for the JR West rail system said Rumi Yamashita, 27, and Miyuki Fukuzawa, 29, benefited from a 1997 revision of Japan's equal opportunity law, which banned sexual discrimination in recruiting, appointing and promoting workers.</p>
        <p>(Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>JAPAN: SUICIDE RISE -- The number of suicides hit a record 33,048 in the year ending in March, with the nation's prolonged economic slump taking its toll, the police said. Health problems accounted for half of all suicide cases while economic hardship was blamed for another fifth, an 11.5 percent jump from the previous year's survey. Ninety-two percent of the economy-related suicides involved men, as companies abandon their tradition of employment for life.</p>

        <p>INDIA: GANDHI TOUR -- The Congress Party president, Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born inheritor of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, left, will make her first trip abroad as leader of the opposition for a conference of presiding officers of parliaments in New York that begins on Aug. 31. The delegation will also include the Bharatiya Janata Party's Pramod Mahajan, the Samajwadi Party's Mulayam Singh Yadav and the Nationalist Congress Party chief, Sharad Pawar.</p>

        <p>INDIA: ANTI-CHRISTIAN SUSPECT -- Police in the southern state of Karnataka said they had arrested a junior air force officer, Syed Hasan Ur Zama, as a suspect in the bombings of Christian churches this summer. They said Mr. Zama, a member of a Muslim organization called Deendar Anjuman, admitted passing information about the location of railway bridges and defense posts to Pakistan. Most attacks on Christians have been blamed on Hindu groups.</p>

        <p>HONG KONG: HAVEN FOR ACTIVIST -- Hong Kong granted the right of permanent residence to one of Beijing's most vocal critics, Frank Lu Siqing, who runs the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy. Mr. Lu entered Hong Kong illegally in 1993 and started the center, which disseminates news about Chinese dissidents, in 1996. Hong Kong residents normally can receive permanent ''right of abode'' after seven years, but his illegal entry and the hostility of China, which regained control over Hong Kong in 1997, had raised doubts about his chances.</p>

        <p>IVORY COAST: ANTI-JUNTA PROTESTS -- Thousands of youths chanting anti-government slogans marched through Abidjan, the commercial capital, in the first major public protest since the military coup in December. They demanded that the junta leader, Gen. Robert Guei, step down rather than run for president in Sept. 17 elections to restore civilian rule.</p>
