        <p>Richard C. Notebaert, former chairman of the Ameritech Corporation, has agreed to become chief executive of Tellabs Inc., the medium-sized maker of communications equipment. Mr. Notebaert takes the reins on Sept. 18. Michael J. Birck, one of the company's founders and the current chief executive, will give up that title and become the company's chairman. Previously, Tellabs did not have a chairman, though Mr. Birck filled that role informally. Mr. Notebaert, 53, left Ameritech, one of the Bell local phone giants, when that company was acquired last year by SBC Communications Inc. The move to Tellabs may be fitting because Ameritech was based in Chicago while Tellabs is based in Lisle, Ill., a Chicago suburb. Tellabs has long been more respected for its technology than for its business acumen. The company is best known for its products that connect fiber optic communications rings to one another. From a business standpoint, however, the company's acquisitions generally have not been fantastically successful. Tellabs shares rose $1.0625, to $62.6875, yesterday in Nasdaq trading.</p>
