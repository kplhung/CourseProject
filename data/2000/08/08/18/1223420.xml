        <p>Robin Ventura detected the grimace when Mike Hampton hit a grounder in the third inning. The next indication was Hampton's trot to first base.</p>
        <p>Ventura approached Hampton during his warmup pitches the next inning. ''I know you want two more innings but if you keep pitching and really hurt yourself, the next two months aren't going to be too good,'' Ventura said he told him.</p>
        <p>Things are going too well for the Mets to let an ill-timed injury interrupt their streak. When a recurrence of pain from an old football injury knocked out Hampton, Turk Wendell provided four strong innings in relief. Four homers completed a 13-2 victory over the Rockies at Shea Stadium, as the Mets finished a 6-2 homestand. They moved two and one-half games behind first-place Atlanta in the National League East and four and one-half games ahead of Arizona, which also did not play yesterday, in the wild-card race.</p>
        <p>Precautionary X-rays revealed a pre-existing stress fracture in Hampton's right ribs, an injury he believes he suffered as a senior in 1989 playing football for Crystal River High School in Homosassa, Fla. Hampton, who took a helmet to the ribs while carrying the ball, had the ribs wrapped at halftime and started the second half. He left after one play, but proudly recalled playing the next week.</p>
        <p>Such optimism was missing yesterday, when Hampton admitted feeling worried and was not sure if he could make his next start on Tuesday. Manager Bobby Valentine said Hampton was questionable but did not think he would need to go on the disabled list. Pat Mahomes, who started the first game in Tuesday's doubleheader, would most likely be the substitute.</p>
        <p>The rib had not bothered Hampton since high school until he began feeling discomfort in his previous four or five starts. The pain resurfaced on the groundout. He lasted six pitches into the fourth inning before Ventura approached him. Soon, the trainer Fred Hina and the pitching coach Dave Wallace followed, and then Valentine came out. With a 5-0 lead, Hampton's competitive side battled his logical one.</p>
        <p>''I thought I could get through it,'' Hampton said. ''I was kind of stubborn. I just wanted to pitch.''</p>
        <p>The training staff said Hampton could not aggravate the injury by playing through it, meaning his status hinges on his pain tolerance. Hampton, who has a 2.44 earned run average in his last 19 starts, can feel the pain taking a deep breath and throwing a four-seam fastball. He said it hurts the most when he swings a bat, and the proud hitter, who is batting .293, vowed to be a cautious swinger. He said the injury would need eight weeks to heal completely.</p>
        <p>''I don't have that kind of time,'' he said. ''The team needs me.''</p>
        <p>Wendell had just arrived in the bullpen when he was stunned to learn he would pitch. Hampton was not the only one recalling his teens. In his longest outing in three years, Wendell felt like a starting pitcher in high school. He was unusually prepared. John Franco joked that he was on vacation because he had not pitched since Monday. Wendell, third in the major leagues in appearances with 62, had thrown only six and one-third innings since reliever Rick White's arrival July 29.</p>
        <p>Wendell (5-4) allowed two runs, one earned, and struck out a career-high six. He was as reckless as ever, even with a thin bullpen behind him. Mahomes, who is usually the long man, was still unavailable after throwing six and two-thirds innings Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Wendell doesn't consider such trivialities during games. He didn't when he dove past second base to avoid a tag in the fifth inning, trying to take an extra base after a misplay on his first hit since 1996. He was out, but blamed himself for not hustling out of the batter's box. At least Wendell's monstrous 37 1/2-inch, 35-ounce bat finally produced his first hit as a Met.</p>
        <p>And Wendell did not think twice when he dove after a loose ball in foul territory in the seventh, flipping over to make an errant throw off the base runner at third that allowed a run to score for the Rockies.</p>
        <p>''I don't live life or do things because I'm afraid to get hurt,'' said Wendell, who added that he has never been approached by a Mets coach about his aggressiveness.</p>
        <p>Wendell held the early lead and the Mets piled on Masato Yoshii, a former teammate who was jettisoned to Colorado in January to dump salary. The thin air has not been kind to Yoshii and neither have the Mets. Yoshii pounded a water cooler with two fists after allowing six runs in three and two-thirds innings against them in April.</p>
        <p>Hampton applied a forearm shiver to a cooler in the same series after an equally ineffective outing.</p>
        <p>When Yoshii (5-13) constantly fell behind in the count yesterday, hitters laid off his trademark forkball, rendering him helpless. He allowed nine runs in five innings. Todd Zeile hit his 200th career home run in the fifth inning and Benny Agbayani followed with his 10th homer of the season, giving the Mets seven players with double-digit homers for the first time in 10 years. Robin Ventura and Mike Bordick later hit homers.</p>
        <p>Wendell's outing only continued the bullpen's recent dominance. The offense added a new wrinkle. The 13 runs were the most since the Mets scored 14 against the Rockies in Denver in April, and it was the most runs scored at sea level since they scored 15 at home against the Cubs on April 23.</p>
        <p>''We've been playing good baseball,'' Valentine said. ''We've had to play good baseball to win games and we have been winning. But a team has to know it can win many different ways.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Rockies' TODD HELTON was 1 for 1 with a walk to raise his batting average to .396.</p>
