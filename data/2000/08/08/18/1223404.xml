        <p>An obscure toxicologist at the Environmental Protection Agency who has become an outspoken critic of his agency's findings on malathion, the pesticide widely sprayed last year in New York's battle against the West Nile virus, presented his case today in the court of scientific opinion.</p>
        <p>The toxicologist, Dr. Brian Dementi, who was one of the E.P.A.'s lead scientists in charge of evaluating malathion, testified before an independent scientific advisory panel that the chemical was a potentially greater cancer threat than the federal agency's preliminary and mostly benign report on it. That report found little evidence that it was harmful to humans when used correctly. Dr. Dementi's bosses had convened the panel, partly, they said, in response to his critique.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dementi's dissent has led to repercussions at work, according to the union that represents federal science workers. The union has filed a grievance saying he has been frozen out of important research meetings and conferences. But he has become a hero to the opponents of spraying in New York, who have argued that pesticide spraying by the city represents a potential health threat to residents equal to or greater than the virus itself.</p>
        <p>The city is not using malathion this year, in part because of questions about its health risks. Instead, it is relying on two other pesticides, sold under the brand names Anvil and Scourge, that officials say are similar to a natural substance produced by chrysanthemum flowers that is toxic to mosquitoes. But critics have raised questions about the long-term risks of those chemicals too.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A.'s initial report on malathion, issued in May, said the chemical showed ''suggestive'' cancer-causing properties in lab animals but represented little risk to people when used properly.</p>
        <p>Today, Dr. Dementi urged the scientific panel to reject that conclusion and to label malathion as a ''likely'' human carcinogen. He argued that malathion's propensity to cause cancer in rats and mice had been greatly underestimated by the way in which the data was interpreted.</p>
        <p>He said the E.P.A.'s interpretation ''runs counter to the agency's responsibility for the protection of the public health,'' and that some of the studies used in reaching that determination ''should be declared unacceptable.''</p>
        <p>Pesticide experts said that while Dr. Dementi's presentation was important for its contribution to the debate about chemicals like malathion, equally important was that the presentation happened at all, in public, with full sanction by the E.P.A. itself.</p>
        <p>The scientific advisory panel has no authority to override the E.P.A.'s conclusions. But its discussion of the evidence will become part of the record on which the final assessment report on malathion, which is expected this fall, will be based, agency officials said.</p>
        <p>''It's significant, given the kind of controversy that has emerged at the staff level over malathion, and in many ways the agency deserves credit for allowing the controversy to emerge into the public,'' said Jay Feldman, executive director of the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides.</p>
        <p>Despite the repercussions, Dr. Dementi said he believed that the agency's willingness to air an alternate view about malathion, going so far as to publish all his memos and research materials as part of the E.P.A. Web site docket on the chemical, was ''probably unprecedented.''</p>
        <p>In an interview here at the hotel where the conference was held, just outside Washington, Dr. Dementi said he thought the attention he had received was also a signal that ''someone else in the agency has a concern.''</p>
        <p>One of the main points of disagreement between the agency's interpretation of the data on malathion, presented to the panel by Dr. Marion Copley of the Office of Pesticide Programs, and Dr. Dementi's, which came immediately after, was the the relative weight of evidence in cases where laboratory rats and mice had been fed the most massive doses of malathion. The agency discounted some of those high-dose results because, Dr. Copley said, they were considered ''excessive'' for purposes of scientific measurement and because no clear conclusions could be drawn about what had happened to the animals.</p>
        <p>Some developed tumors, she said, but many were also overwhelmed by the toxicity of the chemical at those doses, making particular causes of the tumor growth unclear. Dr. Dementi said the trends at those higher doses were too suggestive of tumor production to be thrown out, and that when they are brought back into consideration, malathion's apparent cancer link goes up sharply.</p>
        <p>Another point of dissension about the evaluation was that two companies, using slightly different formulas, were manufacturing malathion during the periods of testing, in the 1980's and 1990's. Different testing organizations also used different time-lengths in measuring the chemicals' effect on rodents, in some cases 18 months, in others 24 months, which makes comparison difficult.</p>
        <p>Malathion, an organophosphate related to the general chemical family that includes nerve gas, was first registered as a pesticide in 1956, and has generally been considered one of the more benign pesticides.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's and early 1990's, vast swaths of Florida and southern California were sprayed with malathion from airplanes and helicopters as those states fought infestations of the Mediterranean fruit fly, or medfly.</p>
        <p>But much of the context of today's hearing was clearly New York and its battle with the West Nile virus.  And at least one New Yorker came to make her voice heard by the panel, and to support Dr. Dementi.</p>
        <p>Joyce Shepard, a psychiatric social worker, said she started a malathion hot line after hearing continuing reports of people complaining of respiratory distress, rashes and other ailments after their neighborhoods had been sprayed. She told the panel that New York became a giant laboratory last year for testing the effects of malathion on humans.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shepard hissed and groaned from the audience when testimony was presented that she did not like, and wildly applauded Dr. Dementi in the middle of his presentation.</p>
