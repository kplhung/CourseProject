        <p>It's the rare big band that could withstand the peeling away of all its horns and reveal a superb rhythm section at its heart. Since Count Basie's waning years, the rhythm section has been generally the least interesting thing in a big band; grand, modernist edifices of harmony and counterpoint tend to be its calling card. But the rhythm section in Jason Lindner's group, which plays at Sweet Basil through Sunday night, proves that supposition wrong.</p>
        <p>Actually, big bands are becoming fairly rare. It isn't easy to run a 12-piece ensemble, especially one full of young and hungry players who don't all have teaching jobs or dependable performing work, and have it play week after week for five years; but that's what the West Village jazz room Smalls has enabled Mr. Lindner to do.</p>

        <p>It's the rare big band that could withstand the peeling away of all its horns and reveal a superb rhythm section at its heart. Since Count Basie's waning years, the rhythm section has been generally the least interesting thing in a big band; grand, modernist edifices of harmony and counterpoint tend to be its calling card. But the rhythm section in Jason Lindner's group, which plays at Sweet Basil through Sunday night, proves that supposition wrong.</p>
        <p>Actually, big bands are becoming fairly rare. It isn't easy to run a 12-piece ensemble, especially one full of young and hungry players who don't all have teaching jobs or dependable performing work, and have it play week after week for five years; but that's what the West Village jazz room Smalls has enabled Mr. Lindner to do.</p>
        <p>With the release of his first album, ''Premonition,'' on Stretch/Concord, Mr. Lindner has occasion to get out of Smalls and into one of the big jazz clubs for the first time; the musicians are stretching their limbs, and the music sounds oiled and magnificent. He uses his own compositions as well as those of members of the band; the group's palette is unusually wide. It comes partly from big-band innovators a generation or two removed -- people like Randy Weston and Mary Lou Williams -- but also from spacey 70's jazz-funk. More and more, he's been reveling in the tightly coiled rhythms of Afro-Cuban music; it gives him, as a pianist, a deeper stake in the band's forward motion.</p>
        <p>That kind of Latin bounce was underlying most of his Wednesday night early set; he locked into grooves with the bass player Omer Avital, the drummer Daniel Freedman and the percussionist Kahlil Kwame Bell. But he also believes in unleashing the soloist; the alto saxophonist Myron Walden offered a long, exciting improvisation that climbed slowly in pitch and intensity and finished with screaming tones.</p>
        <p>The most impressive part of the set was a long piece called ''The Five Elements and the Natural Trinity,'' a Latin tune in five-four that changed colors several times, from a simple ensemble arrangement to a rhythm section montuno to a solo-piano connecting sequence, finally ending in a rousing group vamp that showed off Mr. Lindner's arranging skills.</p>
        <p>He wrote separate melodies for the horns that collided, or had one chord stretch across time and change color, with brass gradually pulling it away from the reeds. Several members of the band are among the young players who are trying to understand the particulars of Afro-Cuban music, and between harmony and rhythm the music lifted off.</p>
