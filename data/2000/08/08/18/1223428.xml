        <p>If it had happened at another time, or to somebody less celebrated in his community, the death of Mahmoud Bazar Abdullah from an Israeli soldier's bullet early Wednesday might have been put down to the mischances and misjudgments that can happen whenever men and guns mix in hard places and hard times.</p>
        <p>At least 24 Palestinian civilians have died in clashes with Israeli troops this year. But Mr. Abdullah, 73, was notable for his American citizenship, and for being the uncle of Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization's chief representative in Washington -- effectively, Yasir Arafat's ambassador to the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abdullah had given up his wholesale clothing business in the United States Virgin Islands and returned to Surda 15 years ago. To neighbors who often made the journey up the hill to see him, he was something more than a rich man with a palatial home. He was a ''wajih,'' a kind of Arab sage who could offer counsel in times of marital trouble, or land disputes, or myriad other village concerns.</p>
        <p>His home, set amid olive groves and vineyards, lay close to Ramallah, a sprawling Palestinian-controlled city, and not far from the largest Israeli military headquarters on the West Bank. Under interim agreements, it was classified a ''B'' area, with Palestinian civil government and Israeli security control.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday morning at 2:30, Mr. Abdullah, alerted by noises in the rocky terrain downhill from the house, went up to its flat roof. What happened next is disputed. Israeli military spokesmen said he fired several pistol shots in the direction of the Israeli soldiers. Mr. Abdullah's family said all they heard was Mr. Abdullah, nervous about burglaries, shouting, ''Who's there?'' followed by a fusillade of automatic fire.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Abdullah's home today, two of his sons related how they had rushed to the roof, found their father unconscious in a pool of blood, then begged for an hour or longer to let him be taken to the hospital. By the time Israeli troops relented, they said, he was dead.</p>
        <p>No Israeli soldier was injured. Israeli commanders acknowledged that troops had held back two ambulances that arrived soon after the shooting -- one Palestinian, the other Israeli. But they said the delay had lasted about half an hour. According to Maariv, an Israeli newspaper, Col. Gal Hirsch, the regional commander, said the delay had been necessary until ''it became completely clear that there were no terrorists in the house and that it was not booby-trapped with explosives.''</p>
        <p>The army issued statements justifying the shooting as a response to hostile fire, and implying a need to prevent Islamic ''terrorist organizations'' from sabotaging the peace negotiations.</p>
        <p>Hisham Abdullah, 41, said he and his brother, Saif, 20, had ducked below the roof parapet to avoid the Israeli fire. Then, he said, he went downstairs and called an Israeli military liaison officer he knew at the Beit El camp in Ramallah, asking him to tell the troops to stop firing and allow the Palestinian ambulance to reach the house.</p>
        <p>But Hisham Abdullah, who is a reporter for Agence France-Presse, said the troops decided that his father had to be carried out by the women in the house. He said that he told them his father was too heavy, and that the soldiers then ordered him and Saif, along with their brother, Mahmoud, 13, to leave the house with their hands above their heads so they could be searched for weapons.</p>
        <p>Only then, he said, were the three of them allowed to place their father on a mattress and drag him along a rocky pathway to the gate. Then they were ordered to return to the house.</p>
        <p>''They forced us to leave him there and go back, and he was still alive,'' Hisham Abdullah said.</p>
        <p>Later, Hisham and Saif Abdullah were taken to the Beit El military camp, where they were held for five hours and told to report back for more questioning on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Hisham Abdullah said an officer of Shin Bet, Israel's internal intelligence service, had accused him of having illicit contacts with Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based Islamic radical movement that fought Israeli troops in southern Lebanon until Israel ended its occupation three months ago after 22 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abdullah said he had tried to turn the conversation to his father, but had been told: ''You're not here because of what happened to your father. You're here because we were going to arrest you anyway.''</p>
        <p>A question widely discussed in the Israeli press today was whether the victim had opened fire.</p>
        <p>Hisham Abdullah and his younger brothers said they had never seen their father with a gun, and saw no weapon on the roof after the shooting. But Colonel Hirsch said, ''My troops found the shooter's gun in the spot from which he fired.''</p>
        <p>As friends and relatives mounted vigil at the house until Mr. Abdullah's funeral on Friday, sipping thimble-sized cups of unsugared coffee, high-ranking Palestinian officials said the shooting boded ill for the peace talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abdel Rahman, the P.L.O.'s Washington representative, suggested that Israelis opposed to peace might have staged the shooting provoke a Palestinian response, thus scuttling the negotiations.</p>
        <p>''This was a cold-blooded murder,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Imad Falouji, the Palestinian communications minister, said he saw the shooting as a warning of the way Israel would react if Mr. Arafat declared statehood on Sept. 13.</p>
        <p>''If they react like this, I can tell you that they will start a war,'' he said.</p>
