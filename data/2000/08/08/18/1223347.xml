        <p>The one-off showcase titled ''Greater New York: New Art in New York Now'' at P.S. 1 last spring received a lot of attention. But the fact is, similar institutional group exhibitions of up-and-coming artists have long been an annual feature in the city's art season.</p>
        <p>Three are on view now, at the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Bronx Museum of the Arts and El Museo del Barrio. The museums themselves are still seen as fringe venues, but that's not their whole story. Yes, they're alternative spaces, and two of them are ethnically specific, so you'll find things there you might not find elsewhere. But they're also integral players in the big picture of American art, and their shows feed the larger pool of talent from which mainstream stars emerge.</p>

        <p>The one-off showcase titled ''Greater New York: New Art in New York Now'' at P.S. 1 last spring received a lot of attention. But the fact is, similar institutional group exhibitions of up-and-coming artists have long been an annual feature in the city's art season.</p>
        <p>Three are on view now, at the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Bronx Museum of the Arts and El Museo del Barrio. The museums themselves are still seen as fringe venues, but that's not their whole story. Yes, they're alternative spaces, and two of them are ethnically specific, so you'll find things there you might not find elsewhere. But they're also integral players in the big picture of American art, and their shows feed the larger pool of talent from which mainstream stars emerge.</p>
        <p>That pool is growing wider all the time. Art isn't just pluralistic these days; it's pulverized. There seems to be one of everything, even when a lot of things feel sort of alike. Old distinctions between art, craft, design and architecture have dissolved. Obsessive hand-crafting and digital technology are equally ubiquitous. Shape-shifting of the most casual kind is the rule.</p>
        <p>The identity consciousness that drove art in the 1990's has soaked in; its tincture comes through no matter what else is going on. Personal roles on which artists once had to be firm -- ethnicity, gender -- they can now play with, layering them, customizing them, taking them off, putting them back on. As for styles, there's room for whatever, from the confrontational to the seriously inconsequential, and all of it is out there, as the summer shows demonstrate.</p>
        <p>Studio Museum in Harlem</p>
        <p>''From the Studio: Artists in Residence'' is the smallest of the annuals, with just three participants. Now in its 32nd year, it is also the oldest, and its family tree includes distinguished alumni like David Hammons, Kerry James Marshall, Alison Saar and Nari Ward. The residents are given studio space for a year on the premises, in a large scuffed-up room divided into thirds by partition walls. In the past, the summer residency show was installed in roughly the same tripartite format. But the curator of the 2000 edition, Thelma Golden, has mixed things together, letting the work interact the way the artists themselves presumably did while they shared quarters.</p>
        <p>It's a good idea. Individual voices are distinct, but they amplify common themes. Nicole Awai, from Trinidad, is a figurative painter with an unprettified technique and a metaphorical bent. Colonialism and how it shaped the West Indies is her subject, built up through overlaid images of tropical birds, wallpaper patterns, antique prints and illustrations from the British-published schoolbooks with which she grew up. Background and foreground in her paintings keep shifting, which is a good way to think about history.</p>
        <p>Terry Boddie, from Nevis in the eastern Caribbean, takes the notion of cultural influence along other routes, back to Africa via his childhood home. In a hushed blend of photography, paint, ink and collage, he joins portraits of his family, pressed tropical leaves, and near-abstract views of moving water to simulate psychic time travel, with images alternately fading out and coming into focus.</p>
        <p>Sanford Biggers tackles cultural convergence with a wry, urban energy, stirring art, politics and world religions together with hip-hop culture. The Black Panthers, Dr. Dre and strange science join forces in his sculpture titled ''The Chronicle,'' a giant Afro pick with a raised fist for a handle and slides of ethnological objects projected onto its surface. ''Mandala of the B-Bodhisattva I'' is a Carl Andre-style floor piece assembled from brightly colored institutional linoleum tiles silkscreened with break-dancing versions of the Indian god Shiva, Lord of the Dance.</p>
        <p>This mandala got some use as a dance floor during the ''Battle of the Boroughs,'' a break-dance competition held in the Bronx this summer. And a larger example appears in a collaboration between Mr. Biggers and the artist David Ellis, who has used Duchampian roto-relief patterns as break-dance pads. It includes a pocket-size video of dancers in action, their acrobatic moves echoing the circular designs on the tile floor. The video is framed by black and white tiles with speckled patterns that evoke a night sky filled with stars. At this point, Mr. Biggers, who received a master's degree  from the Art Institute of Chicago last year, is trying out many ideas and formats, which is fine. He clearly has strength in reserve, and the times are on his side.</p>
        <p>Bronx Museum of the Arts</p>
        <p>The Artist in the Marketplace program, now in its 20th year at the Bronx Museum, is also a residency, but a short one (12 weeks) for 36 participants. It is based on a seminar-style curriculum, with dealers, critics, and museum curators advising on the ins and outs of building a career. As a departing gift, the artists are given a group show, organized this year by Lydia Yee and Edwin Ramoran.</p>
        <p>Three dozen artists are about two dozen too many for the allotted basement gallery. (All the upstairs spaces are occupied by a historical survey of past graduates of the program.) With room for only one or two entries a person, everyone gets the benefit of the doubt, critically speaking, though some work does manage to stand out.</p>
        <p>Figurative paintings and drawings can be self-contained enough to survive such circumstances, and Amy Cutler's dream scenarios and Reet Das's crisp black ink silhouettes of Hindu divinities hold the wall. So do Richard Pasquarelli's abstract ''self-portraits'' made of jigsaw puzzle shapes painted over photographs of the suburban house where he grew up.</p>
        <p>Tim Thyzel's ''Corporate Sculptures,'' made of office construction materials and self-illuminated with light bulbs, have potential, but they need to be punched up a bit, twisted somehow. ''Daemons,'' by Bruce Brosnan, on the other hand, looks witty as is, with its lump-shaped cutout forms standing out from the wall and repeated as painted ''shadows.''</p>
        <p>Patrick Jacobs's peephole installation about vermin and pesticides is ingenious. And a Web site about race, class and consumption by Tana Hargest, still under construction, looks promising, with its promotion of a derma-patch drug called Privitrol, which allows a user ''to discover the benefits of privilege-free living.''</p>
        <p>If there's a trend to be isolated, it might be a light-touch brand of text-based conceptualism involving charts, diagrams and lists, often with personal meanings. Contributions by Marcus Bjernerup, Sara Eichner, Daniel Seiple and Anton Sinkewich all fall, in different ways, into this category, with Beth Campbell being exemplary.</p>
        <p>Ms. Campell is represented here, as she was in ''Greater New York,'' by an elaborate hand-annotated graphite flowchart titled ''My Potential Future Based on Present Circumstances.'' In it she details all the possible outcomes of certain personal and professional choices, real and fictional, plotting them out as a kind of wildly branching nervous system of hopes, fears, and self-recriminations. Although Ms. Campbell was producing such drawings before her Bronx residency, their fever-chart  records of modest triumphs and high anxieties are tailor-made for an artist-in-the-marketplace occasion.</p>
        <p>El Museo del Barrio</p>
        <p>''The S-Files/The Selected Files'' is the baby among the summer annuals; this is its second year. No residency is involved, but the museum has always had a policy of reviewing slides sent in by Latino artists born in the United States and Latin American artists based in New York City. From recent submissions, the curators, Deborah Cullen and Yasmin Ramirez, have culled work by 27 artists -- several of them past participants in the Bronx and Studio Museum residencies -- and made a lively show.</p>
        <p>It has no overriding theme, and certain political and religious images automatically tagged as Latino are absent, or at least played down. The result isn't exactly a post-identity gathering, but on the whole it does take an oblique, submerged approach to social issues, exploring them by way of forms and materials.</p>
        <p>In some cases, it's true, a Latino connection is right up front. Domingo Nuno's elegant computer-manipulated ink-jet prints combine watery patterns with racy love scenes from Spanish-language fotonovelas, and Miguel Trelles's serigraphs have a skeletal Taino shaman eying Jennifer Lopez and an Ingres odalisque.</p>
        <p>One might trace a Latin American baroque sensibility in Paul Henry Ramirez's decorative abstractions, or in Fernanda Brunet's draftsmanly clouds of volcanic smoke, but other readings are equally valid. And while the show's many fabric-based pieces may have distant roots in a tradition of textile industry labor, work by H. A. Rodriguez-Mora, Juana Valdes, and Alejandro Diaz (whose ''Breakfast Tacos at Tiffany's'' is a standout) is interesting for its intelligent and expressive riffs on Minimalism and Pop.</p>
        <p>In general, as Ms. Cullen and Ms. Ramirez argue in the show's slender catalog, there is evidence that the hard ideological lines of the 1990's are growing more supple and elastic  and weaving together in new ways to refresh abiding concerns.</p>
        <p>Hand-altered photographs of Manuel Acevedo, a former Studio Museum artist in residence and a participant in ''Greater New York,'' are at once poetic conceptual fantasies and realizable proposals for revivifying desolate urban landscapes. And a mural drawing in the show by the artist who goes by the name Vargas-Suarez Universal similarly unites divergent impulses.</p>
        <p>Stretching across a wall, it resembles a statistical graph or an EKG readout. But its contours, drawn in a solution of alcohol and blood (the artist's), trace the outlines of two pieces in El Museo's permanent collection by the influential Conceptualist Rafael Montanez-Ortiz, who was among the museum's founders 30 years ago and its first director.</p>
        <p>The mural is a complex homage by a young artist with a complex story. Born in 1972 in Mexico City, Vargas-Suarez Universal majored in astronomy and art history at the University of Texas. Last year he was in the Bronx Museum's Art in the Marketplace program; this year he was enrolled in a medical course at Mount Sinai hospital, studying, among other things, blood analysis. His installations incorporate architectural references, collaborative sound pieces, scientific data pulled from the Internet and site-specific wall drawings in various media, including ballpoint pen.</p>
        <p>Like many of his colleagues, he is operating both deep inside and way outside familiar, clearly marked categories. And the same may be said of the ''alternative'' museums that, by giving artists like him a platform, play such a seminal role in New York art.</p>
        <p>''From the Studio: Artists in Residence 2000'' is at the Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, through Sept. 17. ''Artist in the Marketplace: 20th Annual Exhibition'' is at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, through Oct. 15. ''The S-Files/The Selected Files'' is at El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, Manhattan, (212) 831-7272, through Sept. 24.</p>
