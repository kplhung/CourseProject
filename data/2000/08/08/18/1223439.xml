        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Legal Firms Cutting Back on Free Services for Poor'' (front page, Aug. 17):</p>
        <p>A decrease in pro bono work by big law firms is a loss not only for clients with unmet legal needs but also for lawyers seeking to practice a profession and for a society increasingly challenged to provide justice for all.</p>
        <p>Here at Southern Methodist University Law School, where 30 hours of public service is a graduation requirement, many students put in far more, resulting in 46,564 hours of free legal services over the last seven years.</p>
        <p>It will be a major opportunity lost when these students go to work at law firms only to find their profession's commitment to service on the wane because business is booming, salaries are high and economic times are too good to find room for unpaid legal services.</p>
        <p>THOMAS W. MAYO  Dallas, Aug. 17, 2000  The writer is an associate professor of law at Southern Methodist University.</p>
