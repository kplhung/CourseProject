        <p>The most expensive auction in history ended here today, when six companies bid nearly $50 billion for licenses to offer a new generation of wireless communications in Germany, the largest economy in Europe.</p>
        <p>The bids exceeded almost all expectations, and far exceeded the $35.5 billion paid by many of the same companies for similar third-generation wireless licenses in Britain in April.</p>
        <p>Stock and bond investors seemed concerned both about the billions the bidders spent on licenses and the billions more required for building the new networks in a brutally competitive market.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the results represented something of a defeat for Europe's two biggest wireless competitors: Deutsche Telekom, a former monopoly, and Vodafone AirTouch of Britain, which owns Mannesmann Mobilfunk and is a neck-and-neck rival with Deutsche Telekom in this country's wireless market. Each had been intent on capturing enough licenses to limit the number of new rivals. Despite pushing up the bids by nearly $15 billion since Monday morning, they failed to knock out smaller companies and must now face more competitors.</p>
        <p>Most of today's successful bidders are intent on owning pan-European and even global wireless networks. Besides Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone, they include MobilCom A.G., a fast-growing German phone carrier that is backed by France Telecom; Viag Interkom, in which a controlling stake has just been bought by British Telecommunications; Group 3G, led by Telefonica of Spain and Sonera of Finland; and another consortium led by KPN Mobile of the Netherlands and NTT DoCoMo of Japan. [A third partner, the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, withdrew a few hours after the group won a $7.7 billion license, Bloomberg News reported from Hong Kong early Friday, quoting Canning Fok, Hutchison's group managing director.]</p>
        <p>''For consumers, the result promises the most intense competition,'' said Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head of Germany's telecommunications regulatory agency. ''This was the most favorable solution.''</p>
        <p>Today's results, four months after Britain's third-generation wireless auction, are part of a much larger project. European Union nations, and eventually those in Eastern Europe as well, are awarding new licenses. Analysts predict that the total cost of licenses across Europe could reach $150 billion.</p>
        <p>Germany, with 82 million people, is crucial for companies with pan-European ambitions. In addition, the affluent Germans use mobile phones less than people in many countries nearby, so there is room for growth.</p>
        <p>But the costs of controlling a Continental chessboard are huge. Beyond the cost of wireless licenses, the big companies are spending enormous amounts of money acquiring existing carriers. Just today, British Telecom announced an agreement to pay as much as 7.35 billion euros, or $6.7 billion, for 45 percent more of Viag Interkom, Germany's fourth-largest wireless company.</p>
        <p>That deal comes in the wake of France Telecom's recent purchase of Orange P.L.C., with Britain's second-largest wireless network, and Deutsche Telekom's bid to acquire VoiceStream Wireless of the United States for $50 billion.</p>
        <p>In theory, the new third-generation wireless networks will provide the capacity and technology to offer far faster and more advanced data services than those now available. Supporters of the third-generation networks talk of high-speed mobile Internet access, scores of mobile commerce applications, and even the ability to receive streams of video over a cellular phone.</p>
        <p>In practice, no one is yet sure what services will prove practical and what consumers might be willing to pay for them. But most analysts say that ordinary mobile phone service will become steadily cheaper and will no longer provide the steep revenue growth that wireless operators have enjoyed in the last decade.</p>
        <p>The big bet is that as mobile telephones become even more widely used but far less profitable, exotic new data services will more than make up for the difference.</p>
        <p>''If you don't believe that the average revenue per month will double over the next 10 years, then there really isn't any point in participating in the auctions,'' said Holger Grawe, a telecommunications analyst at WestLB Panmeure in Dusseldorf. Mr. Grawe, along with many others, is convinced that the bet will ultimately pay off.</p>
        <p>But in the short term, investors are increasingly nervous. Deutsche Telekom's stock has fallen by almost half this year, mostly in the wake of the British auctions that generated unexpected high prices.</p>
        <p>Duncan Warwick-Champion, telecommunications analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's in London, said that all the companies in today's auction were poised for possible downgrading of their credit ratings.</p>
        <p>Particularly vulnerable, Mr. Warwick-Champion said, is Royal KPN of the Netherlands, which has teamed up with BellSouth of the United States to acquire control of the E-Plus wireless network in Germany. But Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and British Telecom will be put on a credit watch list for possible downgrading.</p>
        <p>''I think these sorts of auctions are shortsighted and counterproductive,'' said Eden Zoller, a senior consultant at Ovum, a telecommunications research firm in London. ''They would all be much better spending their money on developing new services.''</p>
        <p>Beyond the huge cost of wireless licenses in Europe, investors are also digesting the impact of deals like France Telecom's purchase of Orange and Deutsche Telekom's agreement to acquire VoiceStream. And Deutsche Telekom's bid may be blocked by American regulators, adding to the uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Bernd Eylert, a Deutsche Telekom executive who is also chairman of a mobile phone industry group called the U.M.T.S. Forum, said the huge cost of licenses could put pressure on operators to build their networks as fast as possible.</p>
        <p>Other executives expressed frustration. ''We could have had it for 30 billion marks less,'' said Peik von Bestenbostel, a spokesman for Viag Interkom, which announced several days ago that it would seek only two rather than three licenses allowed under the bidding rules.</p>
        <p>Another executive called it ''the worst possible scenario'' -- high license prices and the maximum number of competitors at the same time.</p>
        <p>Under the German government's rules, 12 licenses were up for auction but a company had to win two licenses to establish a service. Theoretically, it was possible for four companies to emerge with all the licenses, but most experts had predicted that five companies would prevail -- two with three licenses each and three smaller competitors with two each.</p>
        <p>Despite the extraordinarily high prices, Mr. von Bestenbostel said Viag was ready to plow ahead.</p>
        <p>''We think it is an extraordinary opportunity, and we are ready for a market with six players,'' he said.</p>
