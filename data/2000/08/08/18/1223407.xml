        <p>Route 4, a rural highway that twists across Vermont's midsection, passes the sort of roadside signs one would expect in northern New England. Maple syrup, they advertise. Cheddar cheese. Bed and breakfasts.</p>
        <p>And then outside a 150-year-old farmhouse is the sign adorned with a Star of David, announcing the presence of Congregation Shir Shalom, also known as the Woodstock Area Jewish Community.</p>
        <p>Unexpected? Perhaps, but also very much a sign of the times.</p>
        <p>''Even Jews haven't realized the extent to which Jews have moved to the country,'' said Stuart M. Matlins, founder of the synagogue along with his wife, Antoinette.</p>
        <p>Mr. Matlins, a New York native, management consultant and, more recently, a publisher, said that every-other-Friday services this summer had been drawing 50 to 60 people. On the High Holy Days last year, he added, 200 came to services.</p>
        <p>America's Jewish population, about six million, has changed little in total number in recent years, but it is not immune from the restless impulses that make the United States a transient society.</p>
        <p>In disparate places, Jewish communities are growing -- and as they do, new synagogues are appearing in towns from Woodstock in the Green Mountains to Ketchum, Idaho, and Park City, Utah, in the Rockies, where such institutions have been rare, if they existed at all.</p>
        <p>What is happening, said Samuel C. Heilman, professor of Jewish studies and sociology at City University of New York, is part of a trend, ''a radiating Jewish community,'' he called it, whose members have been moving from once-solidly Jewish neighborhoods to the suburbs and, for some, to rural areas.</p>
        <p>''What you have here is Jews who are so much a part of America now,'' Professor Heilman said, ''they no longer feel constrained to live among Jews.''</p>
        <p>The 2000 edition of the American Jewish Yearbook, published by the American Jewish Committee, shows that Jewish populations have been growing in such widely scattered places as Portland, Ore.; Tampa, Fla.; Charleston, S.C.; and Portsmouth, N.H.</p>
        <p>The Jewish population is also increasing in Vermont. By the yearbook's count, about 5,700 Jews live there -- only 1 percent of the state's population but double the number of Jews there two decades ago. Congregation Shir Shalom belongs to Judaism's liberal Reform movement. The newer, small-town synagogues tend to be non-Orthodox, partly because the challenges of living an Orthodox lifestyle -- requiring kosher food and walking to services -- are difficult in places where Jewish resources are scarce.</p>
        <p>The Woodstock synagogue began a dozen years ago with services in Mr. Matlins's office, at the company he founded, Jewish Lights Publishing. The company publishes books on Jewish spirituality and life, and, through a sister imprint, on topics related to religious experience more broadly.</p>
        <p>During the 1990's, the congregation grew, with new residents (mainly young families and retirees), along with people who had weekend homes in the area.</p>
        <p>''They want to live in a rural area and have a Jewish life,'' said Mr. Matlins, 60, who serves on the board of Hebrew Union College, which trains men and women as Reform rabbis, cantors and educators.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, the group reached a sufficiently critical mass to buy the farmhouse, both for its services and its Hebrew school. Local Protestant, Roman Catholic and Unitarian-Universalist clergy attended the dedication. The congregation also affiliated with the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the Reform movement's synagogue organization.</p>
        <p>Around the same time, another small-town temple, in Great Barrington, Mass., joined the union. Lately, officials say, such additions to the ranks are not unusual.</p>
        <p>''They're emerging in very interesting areas,'' said Rabbi Daniel Freelander, the union's director of program, citing synagogues in places like Bainbridge Island, Wash.; Hickory, N.C.; and Keene, N.H.</p>
        <p>Many, like the one in Woodstock, are too small to afford a full-time rabbi and rely on student rabbis who come once or twice a month. They also depend on volunteers to keep them running.</p>
        <p>In Woodstock, that category includes Bob and Muriel Steinberg, who retired from their jobs in West Hartford, Conn., four years ago. After they began attending the synagogue as full-time Vermont residents, Mr. Steinberg said, ''It just hit me, there was something to be done.''</p>
        <p>His wife, he said, ''has the people skills, I have the organizational skills.'' They now serve as its co-presidents.</p>
        <p>The synagogue's roadside sign helps attract people, Mrs. Steinberg said. One day last summer, her husband was standing outside when two young women pulled up and asked about services. He invited them to attend that evening, which they did. ''As it turned out,'' Mr. Steinberg said, ''one was from Brazil, one was from Argentina.''</p>
        <p>Inside, the sanctuary exudes a feeling of intimacy, befitting a space that once served as a living room. Three Shaker-style benches, arranged on a wooden floor, face an ark whose hand-carved cover depicts the tree of life. ''We can get 50 to 60 people in here,'' Mr. Matlins said. Upstairs, what had been bedrooms have been turned into classrooms and meeting rooms.</p>
        <p>Nearby stands an old barn, built of rough-hewn logs. The congregation is mulling whether to convert it to a new sanctuary to accommodate more people.</p>
        <p>Outside the sanctuary, with Mount Tom as his backdrop, Mr. Matlins was moved to reflect on Judaism's traditions in light of the faith's earliest history. In such a place as Woodstock, he said, an event like the Feast of Tabernacles -- in which Jews set up sukkahs, or booths, as reminders of the Israelites' sojourn in the wilderness -- has a resonance lacking in more urban areas.</p>
        <p>''Judaism,'' he said, ''was a religion of people who did not live in cities.''</p>
