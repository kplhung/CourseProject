        <p>Negotiators for more than 86,000 striking workers and Verizon Communications continued to talk early today, past a midnight deadline that some union representatives had set to end formal talks.</p>
        <p>It appeared likely that talks between high-level representatives of the unions and Verizon would continue through the night and perhaps longer, regardless of what midlevel union negotiators did at midnight, people close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>That was made possible after the unions' three main bargaining units, which were divided on Wednesday, agreed to draw up a unified proposal last night, a person close to the talks said. The main sticking points are now job security and mandatory overtime.</p>
        <p>The cooperation would probably mean that the unions' concern about the movement of work after Bell Atlantic's recent acquisition of the GTE Corporation, a transaction that formed Verizon, would eclipse the concern about mandatory overtime, people close to the talks said.</p>
        <p>In any case, the highest-level negotiators on each side, Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., Verizon's vice president and co-chairman, and Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America, were exchanging details of the proposal by fax last night.</p>
        <p>''I'm prepared to stay all night,'' Mr. Bahr said near the midnight deadline.</p>
        <p>The communications workers' union represents about 72,000 striking employees, while the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers represents about 14,000. The walkout affects a region stretching from Virginia to Maine that has more than 25 million customers.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, representatives for the communications workers in New York and New England and representatives for the electrical workers' union said they would break off talks if an agreement was not reached by midnight last night.</p>
        <p>That would have left a communications workers' bargaining unit representing striking employees in several mid-Atlantic states alone in bargaining with Verizon. That bargaining unit's main priority was gaining concessions on mandatory overtime.</p>
        <p>That has been an important issue throughout the strike region but perhaps more so in the states where the reluctant bargaining unit is strongest, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Customer service representatives in those states -- unhappy with the amount of overtime they work -- have a greater voice in union elections.</p>
        <p>In New York and New England, it is less important because technicians, who are generally paid more than customer service representatives, are likely to favor more overtime. In that region, they are gathered into union locals without much mixture with the customer service representatives.</p>
        <p>At least officially, the communications workers' union for employees in New York and New England said it supported its counterpart in the mid-Atlantic region. It and the electrical workers' union together represent nearly two-thirds of the striking employees.</p>
        <p>''This bargaining team is prepared to work whatever hours it takes to get a contract, but we are not willing to be ignored or disrespected,'' negotiators from the communications workers' union said in an e-mail message circulated before midnight among union leaders in New York.</p>
        <p>Verizon, for its part, appeared ready to make some concessions yesterday to speed a resolution to the strike, which has disrupted the company's efforts to make repairs and start new service.</p>
        <p>On the issue of movement of work, for example, the company reduced the percentage of employees who could have their jobs formally redefined by the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger to between 1 percent and 2 percent, down from 4 percent. Still, the unions and the company were in disagreement over how the movement of work would be measured, a person close to the talks said.</p>
