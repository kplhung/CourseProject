        <p>By opening with a six-under-par 66 to share the first-round lead with Scott Dunlap, Tiger Woods has put himself in front-running position once again, forcing the competition to play catch-up. Reaction among those chasing him ranged from indifference to admiration.</p>

        <p>The chase has begun.</p>
        <p>By opening with a six-under-par 66 to share the first-round lead with Scott Dunlap, Tiger Woods has put himself in front-running position once again, forcing the competition to play catch-up. Reaction among those chasing him ranged from indifference to admiration.</p>
        <p>''I feel like a good round tomorrow will put me right back in it over the weekend,'' said Phil Mickelson, who shot 70. ''I am not overly excited or disappointed about the round. I ended up making a couple of good up-and-downs to salvage par. There were a couple of times on par 5's where I was looking to pick up a shot or two and let a few slide away.</p>
        <p>''It could have been better; it could have been worse. But at this point, with 54 holes to go, I'm not worried abut Tiger being six under.''</p>
        <p>Greg Norman, who shot 75, said that Woods had sent a message. Woods has a chance to win four of the last five majors, and he could be the P.G.A. Championship's first back-to-back winner since Denny Shute won in 1936 and '37.</p>
        <p>''When a player of that caliber gets that much confidence, and when he sees and feels the other players saying, 'Oh, there he goes again,' it gives him another shot of confidence. You have to get over that hump and know that you are good enough to beat whoever is leading,'' Norman said. ''If you are not good enough to do that, don't even be out here. He's playing exceptionally good golf, no question about that.''</p>
        <p>Darren Clarke, who defeated Woods head-to-head in February during the final round of the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship, hoped to have another showdown with Woods this weekend at Valhalla Golf Club.</p>
        <p>''If that were the case, the chance to compete against the world's No. 1 would be fantastic,'' Clarke said. ''But there is a long way to go yet.''</p>
        <p>Brown Impresses With 71</p>
        <p>Jean Van de Velde, who finished at 70, was paired with Mark Brown, a 34-year-old head club professional at Tam O'Shanter Club in Brookville, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Brown impressed Van de Velde with an opening-round 71, especially when Brown said he had never played in a tour event before.</p>
        <p>''Jean asked me how many tour events I had played in, and I said, 'I'm a haberdasher, I sell clothes,' '' said Brown.</p>
        <p>''That is pretty depressing, isn't it?'' Van de Velde said. ''I thought, 'Geez, he may not play every day, and he hits the ball 10 times better than I did.' What is he thinking about? I think he has got the talent to be here, no doubt about it. He strikes the ball so well and he is very athletic. He is very relaxed. He has got a good feel. What else do you want? I think he should reconsider what he is going to do in his next 10 years. If I was him, I would.''</p>
        <p>Flesch Humbled in Home State</p>
        <p>Steve Flesch, a Kentucky native hoping to play well in front of friends and family, struggled with a 76.</p>
        <p>''Tomorrow, I have to play well enough to make sure I am here on Saturday,'' Flesch said. ''I can't say I was nervous. Unfortunately, I just hit some bad shots. Maybe it will be better tomorrow.''</p>
