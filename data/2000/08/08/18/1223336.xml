        <p>Revisiting ''Rent'' in its maturity -- more than four years after it opened at the Nederlander Theater on Broadway, four and a half since its premiere downtown -- is a little like meeting a cousin for the first time since he or she was an infant and seeing a human being, not just the promising future.</p>
        <p>Mostly this has to do with reality in the interim; not too many kids  change the world, no matter what we envision for them. And ''Rent,'' alas, a rock opera so startlingly fresh and original when it first splashed down at the New York Theater Workshop in February 1996, hasn't altered the Broadway landscape as many of us thought it might.</p>
        <p>You may remember that ''Rent'' followed close on the heels of George C. Wolfe and Savion Glover's ''Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk,'' another show that, fusing contemporary sound with the tradition of the musical theater, began life in a nonprofit Off Broadway house (at the Joseph Papp Public Theater) and moved to the commercial spotlight Uptown. And together they seemed to herald an exciting chapter in the American musical, one in which the sounds and ideas informing a younger generation would lure new audiences to the theater. So how many like shows have followed successfully in their wake? Well, ''The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin,'' by Kristen Childs, was well received at Playwright's Horizons  this summer. But on Broadway? Exactly none.</p>
        <p>''Bring In da Noise,'' an unqualified success, lasted more than two years on Broadway, but it is now long gone, and at the Nederlander, the only Broadway house below Times Square, ''Rent'' has a tenacious, clinging-to-principle feel. It is showing its age in some conventional ways. The current cast is talented, athletic and good-looking, but reminiscent of the stirring originals in fainter colors, and the sound has become a little sloppy. Particularly in the raucous ensemble numbers, the lyrics by the gifted young composer Jonathan Larson -- who, dreadfully, died on the eve of his first show's first public performance -- are often unintelligible. That robs the show, not just because the words are often clever and touching but because the story moves rapidly -- it's an East Village rendition of ''La Boheme,'' remember? -- and like all good stories it deepens when the details are sharp.</p>
        <p>Still, ''Rent'' remains a vibrant and visceral experience. Tuesday night's audience was pleasingly young and fresh-faced, suburban, I think, rather than out of town, hopefully hip, with a collective Archie-and-Veronica mien, and if not exactly rainbow-colored, then not uniform either. And even if they weren't following every plot line, they obviously thrilled to the romanticism of Mr. Larson's wonderfully varied score. You can tell when an audience is not merely being entertained by a show but has bonded with it, and this one did. That's not surprising; even for someone maybe twice the median age of the crowd it was evident that for all the avid show business on display, ''Rent'' is the most realistic musical on Broadway.</p>
        <p>I hadn't seen ''Rent'' since its New York Theater Workshop days, and that's what I had forgotten about it. It feels like a revelatory visit to a genuine place, poor but agurgle with energy, a circumscribed world, to be sure, but one that brushes against my neighborhood. (This is literally true; I live only blocks away from the corner of 11th Street and Avenue B, where the show is set in an unheated loft.)</p>
        <p>The motley costumes (by Angela Wendt), replete with imaginative low-budget sex appeal; the darkly dramatic lighting (by Blake Burba) that underscores an after-midnight society; the intermittent appearance of a squeegee man, with his mantra, ''Honest living! Honest living!''; the easy intercourse (social even more than sexual) among characters with variegated and flamboyant predilections; the casual resignation to the lure of insidious drugs, the hormonal yearning worn on every sleeve, and, of course, the gruesomely poised scepter of AIDS: all of these ground the show in a neighborhood as tangible as Times Square, and it's a foundation upon which the highly pitched emotions and ultimate tragedies of the musical's melodrama are, in a word, believable.</p>
        <p>Not to sound old and chastened, but it's easy to forget, I think, what it's like to be young, ambitious, frustrated, love-starved, randy and broke, and even though our popular culture is overstuffed with paeans to the exuberance and pain of youth, it is rare when any work makes older people take younger people seriously. We've all been there, right? What can we learn?</p>
        <p>''Rent,'' for all its joyousness and generosity, is a terribly sad work; two very lovable characters die and another is ill, and seeing the show this time I felt that sadness acutely. Maybe more than my fellow theatergoers, I found myself thinking of Jonathan Larson, whose death at 35 from an aortic aneurysm movingly, if cruelly, underscores the show's carpe diem theme.</p>
        <p>I knew him, in a small way, long before I ever heard of ''Rent,'' when he was living, I imagine, among the kinds of people his show brings to life. A sweet-tempered young man with an easy, respectful manner, he worked behind the counter at a diner I frequented; he told me he was a theater composer and occasionally filled me in on his works in progress. He made a great milkshake, something I remembered in a powerful rush this week, when, in the opening moments of ''Rent,'' the phone machine beeps in the loft that belongs to Mark, the show's narrator (Trey Ellett), and his H.I.V.-positive roommate Roger (Manley Pope). On the line is Mark's mother (Maggie Benjamin), who delivers a cheery recitative:</p>
        <p>It's Mom</p>
        <p>We wanted to call and say we love you</p>
        <p>And we'll miss you tomorrow</p>
        <p>Cindy and the kids send their love</p>
        <p>Oh, I hope you like the hot plate.</p>
        <p>We tend to dismiss corrupted innocence as merely corrupt, when what ''Rent'' gets across, persuasively and intelligently, is how wrong that is: innocence fouled is still, at heart, innocence. That's a message that has to come from the young, and in the musical theater at least, the subsequent silence has been profound. Jonathan Larson would undoubtedly have had more to say. Now it's up to others.</p>
