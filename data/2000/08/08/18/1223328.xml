      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Mifune</p>
        <p>Soren Kragh-Jacobsen's film violates at least one of the principles of Dogma 95, the Danish school of stripped-down filmmaking, by divulging the directorial credit. Otherwise, it's a pretty good little movie about a Copenhagen businessman (Anders W. Berthelsen, left) with a BMW and a trophy wife who returns to the rotting farmhouse where he grew up to find his father stretched out dead on top of the kitchen table and his mentally retarded brother (Jasper Asholt) hiding underneath it. A prostitute on the run (Iben Hjejle) and her brother (Emil Tarding), a raffish boarding-school student, fill out an eccentric menage while, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, the ''brusque realism of Mr. Kragh-Jacobsen's style -- his careful suppression of style -- allows a surprising sweetness to emerge.''</p>
        <p>2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37. 99 minutes. Danish with English subtitles. R. Release date: Aug. 22.</p>

        <p>Agnes Brown</p>
        <p>The indefatigable, plucky, good-humored mother of seven adoring children in 1967 Dublin, Agnes (Anjelica Huston) rarely loses her temper despite being poor and newly widowed with mouths to feed. That dazzles the French baker (Arno Chevrier) in her neighborhood, though she prefers the strapping Welsh belter Tom Jones (who puts in an appearance as an inflated 1999 version of his 1967 self). And how does Agnes remain such an ideal gal? ''Only heaven and the creators of upbeat radio serials and popular novels and the people who turn them into treacly feel-good movies could tell you'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>1999. USA. $56.49; DVD, $24.95. 91 minutes. R. Release date: Aug 22.</p>
        <p>It's the Rage</p>
        <p>A limping homage to Robert Altman, James D. Stern's film intertwines the fates of nine characters (Gary Sinise, Anna Paquin, Giovanni Ribisi, David Schwimmer, Andre Braugher, Robert Forster, Joan Allen, Josh Brolin, Bokeem Woodbine), each of them either a perpetrator or a victim of gun violence and sometimes both. But satire turns into ''a ham-fisted, high-concept public service announcement, directed with stagy deliberateness and tin-ear vernacular speechiness'' (Scott).</p>
        <p>2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $99.36; DVD, $24.95. 103 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>Here on Earth</p>
        <p>You know the drill. Suffering young lovers are kept apart by class and tragedy. Sam (Leelee Sobieski), the winsome farm girl, falls for Kelley (Chris Klein), a spoiled young god from the wealthier side of the tracks. Only she is dying of cancer. And underneath Kelley's blank look is actually a poor little rich boy waiting to get out. With its shameless sob story on teen loss, Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times, here is ''the Best Movie of 1961, lacking only the beautiful and vacant visages of Troy Donahue and Suzanne Pleshette.''</p>
        <p>2000. Fox. $104.16; DVD, $34.98. 96 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>MY BEST FIEND. ''Every gray hair on my head I call Kinski,'' says Werner Herzog in his documentary about his stormy relationship with the actor Klaus Kinski. The two made films together, including ''Aguirre: Wrath of God,'' ''Woyzeck'' and ''Fitzcarraldo,'' in the Amazon jungle. ''Quite often it was very difficult to talk to him because he answered back like Jesus,'' Mr. Herzog recalls. ''A splendid job of chronicling the high drama and creative pinnacles of their work together,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. 1999. Anchor Bay. $14.98; DVD, $29.98. 100 minutes. No rating.</p>
        <p>CAUSE CELEBRE. John Gorrie's television film, adapted from Terence Rattigan's play and broadcast on PBS's ''Mystery,'' recounts the case of Alma Rattenbury (Helen Mirren), a 38-year-old former singer who, with her 18-year-old lover, is charged with the murder of her 61-year-old husband (Harry Andrews). Hardly proper and the boy isn't even of the right social class, her lawyer (David Suchet) tells Alma. Ms. Mirren, John J. O'Connor wrote in The New York Times, gives ''a wonderfully complex depiction of a confused woman caught in a situation that suddenly reveals her to herself.'' 1988. Lance Entertainment. $19.95. 105 minutes.</p>
        <p>MURDER MUST ADVERTISE. Ian Carmichael is Lord Peter Wimsey in the BBC production, based on the story by Dorothy L. Sayers. 1974. Acorn. $59.95; four-volume boxed set. 200 minutes. Information: (800) 474-2277.</p>
