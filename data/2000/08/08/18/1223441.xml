        <p>The retirement package awarded by the Halliburton Company to Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice president, is nowhere near the largest ever given to a chief executive, but it is trailblazing nonetheless.</p>
        <p>Part of Mr. Cheney's  estimated $20 million package consists of a stock option grant. And although options are an increasingly popular form of executive compensation, they would be in totally uncharted territory in the hands of a vice president, whose role in the White House would have the potential to affect the company's fortunes and so place him in a conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Cheney resigned from  Halliburton two days ago, he received an unspecified bonus, was freed to sell 140,000 formerly restricted shares of company stock and was allowed to keep options on 1.16 million shares. The current value of Mr. Cheney's stock and options, which give him the right to buy Halliburton shares at a specified price, is approximately $39 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney has said that if the Republican ticket wins the election, he will sell his Halliburton shares before he takes office, removing one  potential conflict of interest that he would have in the future of the oil services giant.</p>
        <p>But the way Halliburton has structured part of Mr. Cheney's option grant would keep him squarely in a conflict: 233,000 of his options -- worth around $3.8 million, if they could be exercised today -- can be turned into shares of Halliburton only in December 2001 and December 2002. Because he cannot sell or transfer the options before then, he would continue to have a stake in the  company while vice president.</p>
        <p>Dirk Vande Beek, a spokesman for Mr. Cheney, former secretary of defense, said yesterday, ''Secretary Cheney will do whatever he needs to do to avoid any conflict of interest.''</p>
        <p>But exactly what he would need to do is not cut and dried. Neither the president nor the vice president is subject to the criminal conflict-of-interest laws that govern all other employees in the executive branch. Both must complete financial disclosure statements, and politics demands that they work to avoid creating a conflict with their personal interests; the assumption is that voters can judge for themselves whether these elected officials are living up to the nation's standards.</p>
        <p>There are a number of time-tested practices that a high official can follow to avoid conflicts. Mr. Cheney, for example, could recuse himself on matters involving the oil industry, though that might limit his usefulness as a presidential adviser. Like President Clinton or former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, an official can also set up a blind trust for his holdings. But such a trust would not solve any conflict issues posed by Mr. Cheney's options, because the trust is meant to be invested in assets whose identity is unknown to the beneficiary.</p>
        <p>Some experts said Mr. Cheney's best approach would be to divest himself of every Halliburton share and option. ''The cleanest route would be to eliminate self-interest altogether and forfeit and cancel the options,'' said Patrick McGurn, vice president of Institutional Shareholder Services, an investment advisory firm in Rockville, Md. ''But is anybody going to do that? Given the paper value, that's putting a pretty hefty price tag on altruism.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney is by no means the only politician whose public life has been complicated by his or his family's investments. Vice President Al Gore has become the object of environmentalists' wrath for his mother's stake in the Occidental Petroleum Corporation -- a holding worth between $250,000 and $500,000, according to government filings. And the income earned by Mr. Gore on land he leases for zinc mining has raised eyebrows.</p>
        <p>Still, it is Mr. Cheney's retirement package that shines the spotlight on practices in executive compensation  that critics describe as over the top, from enormous grants of stock options to pay that has nothing to do with performance. Carl Schmitt, vice president at WestWard Pay Strategies, an executive compensation consulting firm in San Francisco, believes that Mr. Cheney's deal will bring more public scrutiny to executive pay in general and to retirement packages in particular.</p>
        <p>''There's going to be the continuing issue of the smell test,'' Mr. Schmitt  said. ''It's very common for boards of directors to give sweetheart deals to executives who are retiring. But that may not pass the smell test in the political arena, and that may be a new issue for people to deal with.''</p>
        <p>The immense wealth created by rising stock prices in recent years has made the intersection of Wall Street and Washington an increasingly busy place. Politicians, like most Americans, have flocked to the stock market in search of portfolio gains. Meanwhile, public service holds appeal to many in the corporate sector who have made their fortunes and are looking for a way to give something back to the country.</p>
        <p>''It's the nature of the beast today that you don't see that many lifetime politicians anymore -- they tend to jump in and out of public life,'' Mr. McGurn said. ''So every time one of these transitions occur, the boards of the companies on which they serve have to deal with these issues. It's another one of those issues that is going to come up in the stockholder or stock option society that we've moved into.''</p>
        <p>It is somewhat ironic that Mr. Cheney's relatively modest exit deal should create such a stir. Retirement packages among corporate titans have become so outsized today that some of them can make Mr. Cheney's look like chump change.</p>
        <p>For example, when Doug Ivester retired last year after a largely unsuccessful two-year stint as chairman of the Coca-Cola Company, he received a total package worth $120 million, according to Graef Crystal, an executive compensation specialist who writes a column for Bloomberg News. And Jill E. Barad left as  chief executive of Mattel Inc. with a $50 million package even though the company and its stock had performed woefully under her leadership.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cheney's deal was unusually favorable in one way, according to executive compensation experts:  Halliburton's board did not demand that he quickly exercise all his options. When executives and even lower-level employees retire from a company, they are typically forced to exercise their options within one year of their exit. The longer an option lasts, the greater the potential for large gains.</p>
        <p>''It is a minority of companies that provide the full term of an option, post-retirement,'' said Ed Archer, vice president at Pearl Meyer &amp; Partners, an executive compensation consulting firm in New York. ''Most don't do it.'' Indeed, he said, the general requirement that options be exercised quickly means they are unlikely very often to pose conflicts for ''28-year-old dot-commers'' running for office.</p>
        <p>Wendy Hall, a spokeswoman for Halliburton, said Mr. Cheney had received no special treatment. ''All of this,'' she said, ''is part of our standard retirement policy.''</p>
