        <p>In his speech tonight, Vice President Al Gore made many promises that would cost billions of dollars and many others that would cost little or nothing.</p>
        <p>The proposals that would cost taxpayers money included these:</p>
        <p>*Universal health insurance for all children by 2004. A plan Mr. Gore offered last year would cost more than $24 billion over five years.</p>
        <p>*A doubling of federal spending on medical research. The National Institutes of Health, the government's main sponsor of biomedical research, has a budget of $17.8 billion this year, and Congressional leaders of both parties have vowed to double its budget.</p>
        <p>*More education spending to guarantee a qualified teacher in every classroom. The Gore campaign has said Mr. Gore would spend $115 billion more on education over the next decade.</p>
        <p>*Elimination of the tax penalty paid by some married couples. A Democratic plan defeated in the House this year and supported by the Clinton administration would cost $95 billion over the next decade.</p>
        <p>*Making college tuition tax deductible in most cases. President Clinton has proposed a plan that would cost $31 billion over three years.</p>
        <p>*Modifying the estate tax. A Democratic plan rejected by the Senate this year would cost $64 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>*Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. The latest version of the Clinton administration's proposal would cost $79 billion over five years and $253 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>*A new retirement plan in addition to current Social Security benefits. One plan proposed by President Clinton would cost $500 billion over 15 years.</p>
        <p>These are some of the proposals that would not directly cost the taxpayers money:</p>
        <p>*Regulation of managed-care health plans.</p>
        <p>*Campaign finance reform.</p>
        <p>*Restrictions on marketing tobacco products.</p>
        <p>*Increase in the minimum wage.</p>
        <p>*Support for affirmative action.</p>
        <p>*Renewal of the voting rights act.</p>
        <p>*Laws on hate crimes and employment discrimination against homosexuals.</p>
        <p>*A constitutional amendment to give victims rights in the justice system.</p>
        <p>*Mandatory background checks for gun purchases and safety locks on firearms.</p>
        <p>*Free trade tied to to employment rights and environmental protections in other countries.</p>
