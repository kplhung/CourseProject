        <p>Blaine Wilson continued to dominate his sport with a mesmerizing performance tonight as the Olympic trials opened with the men's preliminary competition at the Fleet Center, but his mentor, 30-year-old John Roethlisberger, is in danger of losing his bid for a third Olympic team.</p>
        <p>Roethlisberger ended the first night of the two-day competition in seventh place. To be sure of making the team, a gymnast has to be in the top four from the combined results of the trials and the nationals held in July. The fifth- and sixth-place gymnasts will be chosen by a committee. If the committee goes strictly by ranking, the remarkable 17-year-old twins from Waukesha, Wis., Paul and Morgan Hamm, could make the team if they stay on the course they set for themselves tonight. Paul Hamm finished in second place behind Wilson while his identical brother was sixth, just ahead of Roethlisberger. No twins have ever been on the men's Olympic gymnastics team.</p>

        <p>Blaine Wilson continued to dominate his sport with a mesmerizing performance tonight as the Olympic trials opened with the men's preliminary competition at the Fleet Center, but his mentor, 30-year-old John Roethlisberger, is in danger of losing his bid for a third Olympic team.</p>
        <p>Roethlisberger ended the first night of the two-day competition in seventh place. To be sure of making the team, a gymnast has to be in the top four from the combined results of the trials and the nationals held in July. The fifth- and sixth-place gymnasts will be chosen by a committee. If the committee goes strictly by ranking, the remarkable 17-year-old twins from Waukesha, Wis., Paul and Morgan Hamm, could make the team if they stay on the course they set for themselves tonight. Paul Hamm finished in second place behind Wilson while his identical brother was sixth, just ahead of Roethlisberger. No twins have ever been on the men's Olympic gymnastics team.</p>
        <p>''This is pretty amazing,'' Morgan Hamm said. ''How many people can say they're a twin and 17 and in the top six? But I know it's not over. Having John just behind me is scary. He's a great competitor.''</p>
        <p>Roethlisberger slipped in the floor exercise and fell from the high bar. He was able to stay close to the top six by nailing his signature event, the pommel horse, with a 9.725. ''It's like I'm fighting some invisible force out there,'' Roethlisberger said. ''I thought about my age and thought maybe my body can't do it anymore. But that doesn't jibe with my training. It doesn't make sense. I don't believe I'm too old.''</p>
        <p>He has a day to sort out the mystery and then attack the finals on Saturday. If he does not crack the top six, he can still make the team if the committee selects him for the fifth or sixth spot. But Coach Peter Kormann said Roethlisberger's body of work will not necessarily put him on the team.</p>
