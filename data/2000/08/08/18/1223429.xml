        <p>In a mixed and complicated verdict today, a federal jury acquitted the founder of the International Boxing Federation of major bribery and racketeering charges, but convicted him on counts of money laundering, tax evasion and interstate travel to aid in racketeering.</p>
        <p>Robert W. Lee Sr., 66, also the former president of the I.B.F., sat motionless at the defense table as the verdict in the four-month-long trial slowly unfolded with the reading by United States District Judge John W. Bissell of a 12-page verdict sheet detailing the charges in the original 34-count indictment.</p>
        <p>Lee was found not guilty on the racketeering charges that were the heart of the government's case. But he was found guilty on six counts and could face a sentence of three years in jail, according to prosecutors.</p>
        <p>The jury also acquitted Robert W. Lee Jr., 38, the son of the I.B.F. founder, of all nine counts that he faced.</p>
        <p>The elder Lee responded to the verdict in a hallway outside the courtroom. ''My head is bloodied, but it's unbowed,'' he said. Lee contended, as his lawyer had during the trial, that the prosecution was racially motivated and aimed at him as an African-American who headed one of boxing's major rating groups.</p>
        <p>''If I had been a Caucasian this would never have happened,'' Lee said.</p>
        <p>The younger Lee called the verdict bittersweet, in that his father was not also acquitted on all counts. The two men were accused of demanding and accepting $338,000 in bribes from nearly two dozen boxers, promoters and managers in exchange for inflated rankings that qualified fighters for lucrative title bouts.</p>
        <p>The jury of seven men and five women had deliberated for 15 days over a period of more than three weeks.</p>
        <p>In interviews, jurors said that their verdict had pivoted largely on their understanding of significant legal points in the judge's instructions to the jury. They also said they had been wary of the credibility of the government's key witness, Colin Douglas Beavers, who was for many years the I.B.F.'s ratings chairman.</p>
        <p>The racketeering charges at the heart of the prosecution case involved a series of alleged violations of the New Jersey commercial bribery law over the 14 years covered by the case. Federal racketeering laws permit federal prosecutors to bring together alleged violations of state and federal laws to try to show a pattern of illegal behavior.</p>
        <p>But jurors said that in many instances they could find no evidence that bribes allegedly paid to the elder Lee, Beavers and other I.B.F. officials had been negotiated or paid in New Jersey, as required under the judge's instructions.</p>
        <p>Without such proof, said one of the jurors, Aileen Smith, ''there was no pattern, and without a pattern there was no racketeering.''</p>
        <p>Gerard Brand, the jury foreman, said jurors had been reluctant to accept uncorroborated testimony from Beavers.</p>
        <p>Beavers testified that he had received many of the bribes that the Lees were said to have demanded, and he also said he had shared those bribes with both Lees and other I.B.F. officials.</p>
        <p>''In the end, we couldn't trust Beavers alone,'' said Brand, recalling the defense suggestion that in the absence of audiotapes and videotapes in which Lee asked for and received bribes directly, there was the possibility that the scheme had involved Beavers alone.</p>
        <p>But Smith said that jurors also thought the elder Lee was not totally innocent. Asked if she thought he had committed crimes, she responded, ''Well, we convicted him of something, didn't we?''</p>
        <p>From the start, the history of the I.B.F. figured prominently in the trial. The organization was created by Lee in 1984 to counter the influence in boxing of white promoters and of the sport's two other major sanctioning groups, the World Boxing Association and the World Boxing Council.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors invoked the I.B.F.'s history to contend that Lee had corrupted boxing under the guise of trying to reform the sport and achieve racial justice.</p>
        <p>But defense lawyers depicted the I.B.F. as an embattled, black-controlled group that was resented by ''multimillionaire white promoters'' as well as by broadcast and cable operators who wanted to control the rankings. The defense argued that the Lees were targets of selective prosecution.</p>
        <p>Gerald Krovatin, the lawyer for Robert Lee Sr., accused the prosecutors of being ''unwittingly allied with these promoters who concocted allegations of bribery.''</p>
        <p>Beavers, the former I.B.F. ratings chairman, was the only witness who directly linked both Lees to the acceptance of payoffs; Lee appeared not to have personally solicited or collected the alleged bribes from promoters or fighters. Beavers testified that he had acted on Lee's behalf.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors also produced 83 audiotapes and videotapes of conversations among Beavers, Lee and others. In one videotape, shot surreptitiously in a Virginia motel room, Beavers is seen removing a packet of bills that are strapped to his ankle and handing it to Lee, while the I.B.F. president in turn slides an envelope across a table to Beavers.</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers portrayed Beavers as a liar who had extorted the money for himself and falsely left promoters with the impression that Lee was behind the arrangement.</p>
        <p>Krovatin, Lee's lawyer, said he would appeal the verdict. Krovatin said there appeared to be some inconsistencies in the jury's decision, suggesting that the jurors had compromised among several strongly held positions.</p>
        <p>He said he was certain only that the jury had rejected ''the core of the government's case'' by acquitting Lee on the racketeering charges. In doing so, the jury seemed to discount testimony from promoters like Robert Arum, Cedric Kushner, Dino Duva and Roland Jankelson, who said they had given bribes to Beavers that they believed were shared with Lee.</p>
        <p>Robert J. Cleary, the United States Attorney for New Jersey, agreed that jurors had rejected the heart of the government's case. But he said he believed that the guilty verdicts on a single count of money laundering, two counts of tax evasion and three counts of interstate travel to aid racketeering would be a ''general deterrent'' to others who might seek to corrupt boxing.</p>
