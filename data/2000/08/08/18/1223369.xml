        <p>Veerappan, the legendary bandit who has humbled two Indian state governments with the kidnapping of a matinee idol, is notorious as an elephant poacher, sandalwood smuggler and ruthless killer who has eluded hundreds of police officers devoted for years to nothing but his capture.</p>
        <p>Now he is reinventing himself as a romantic, gun-toting champion of the people.</p>
        <p>Defying the expectations of the police, he has not demanded a huge ransom or an amnesty for his crimes in exchange for the release of a revered movie star, Rajkumar, 72, whom he has hidden away in the jungle for the past 19 days.</p>
        <p>Rather, Mr. Veerappan's roster of demands reads like a political manifesto for ethnic Tamils and the poor in the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, which have a combined population of 100 million.</p>
        <p>Let a statue to the Tamil-language poet Thiruvalluvar be erected in Kannada-speaking Karnataka, he asserted. Let low-caste families whose relatives have been murdered be compensated, he decreed. Let 51 of my compatriots and 5 Tamil militants -- detained for years without trial under a draconian antiterrorism law -- be released. All these wishes have been granted.</p>
        <p>An official emissary of the two states, a magazine editor, R. R. Gopal, was venturing back today into the immense forest, alive with elephants, tigers and cobras, that is the habitat of the hard-eyed outlaw with the handlebar mustache. Mr. Gopal is bearing documents that prove the states have revoked the detention orders against the 56 people.</p>
        <p>The case has dragged on, but its fascination for the public has not flagged. Nor has its potential to terrify state politicians who fear for their political hides should any harm come to Mr. Rajkumar, an elderly star with bad knees, who, like his kidnapper, goes by one name.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rajkumar himself, in a taped message released in the first week of his captivity, expressed great sympathy for Mr. Veerappan, who -- in kidnapping him from his farmhouse on the fringes of the jungle on July 30 -- respectfully called him ''Sir.''</p>
        <p>''Whatever his desire, please fulfill it,'' the actor pleaded, concluding with a paean to the outlaw: ''He is looking after us with love and affection. He fully trusts us, and we have confidence in him.'' (Three additional hostages were taken.)</p>
        <p>To a remarkable extent, the states have heeded the actor's entreaties, but there has also been outrage at what The Indian Express called ''the abject surrender'' to Mr. Veerappan.</p>
        <p>Without mentioning him by name, President K. R. Narayanan, in a speech on Aug. 14, the eve of Indian Independence Day, declared, ''It is time that civil society and the lawful government asserted their authority and primacy over the daredevil heroes of crime and banditry.''</p>
        <p>But the case is a delicate one. It presents perils that go beyond the dire political consequences for the Congress Party, which governs Karnataka, should harm befall Mr. Rajkumar. Officials fear that Mr. Veerappan's demands could inflame old linguistic and cultural antagonisms between the Tamil-speaking minority and the Kannada-speaking majority in Karnataka, for whom the Kannada-speaking actor, Mr. Rajkumar, is a mythic figure.</p>
        <p>There is a history of anti-Tamil violence in Karnataka's capital, Bangalore. In 1991, 17 Tamils were killed in riots and hundreds of buildings destroyed after a court gave more irrigation water from the Cauvery River to Tamil Nadu than Karnataka wanted to share.</p>
        <p>Mr. Veerappan has again raised these sensitive claims, demanding that Tamil Nadu receive a larger share of the Cauvery water, that the victims of the riots be compensated and that Tamil be given the status of an official language in Karnataka.</p>
        <p>Mr. Veerappan himself is an enigma. The police say he is a cunning, inhuman criminal who strangled his infant daughter, murdered his cousins because they were rival poachers and killed dozens of policemen.</p>
        <p>But in 1996 Mr. Veerappan told his version of the story to Mr. Gopal -- now the official emissary -- in nine hours of videotape whose dialogue has been transcribed and published in Tamil. M. S. S. Pandian, a fellow at the Madras Institute of Development Studies, summarized it and translated portions into English in an essay in the Economic and Political Weekly of Dec. 25.</p>
        <p>Mr. Veerappan describes in detail his kidnappings and killings, but he depicts them as a righteous effort to avenge outrages committed by the police as they pursued him.</p>
        <p>He says they raped, tortured and stole from the forest people who protected him, and preyed on the desperately poor, extorting money from those who depended on illegally hunting elephants and cutting sandalwood for their survival.</p>
        <p>One high-ranking policeman who spent years chasing Mr. Veerappan, who refused to allow his name to be used, acknowledged in an interview that the police had committed terrible abuses over the years.</p>
        <p>In his narration, the outlaw described himself as having been born to a peasant family that could not afford to educate him. He went to work young, he said, grazing cattle. He became a hunter, too, and that led to elephant poaching.</p>
        <p>''We target and shoot at the forehead of the elephant,'' he said. ''It slumps to death without even knowing that life is departing. Good death. To feed on its carcass birds come. 8.4 million living beings like birds and ants would eat it. Of all charity, feeding is the greatest.''</p>
        <p>The question now on the minds of the police and the fans is what Mr. Veerappan will do with Mr. Rajkumar. The risk of violence in Bangalore, the capital of Karnataka, would be great if he were hurt.</p>
        <p>His kidnapping has already stirred his devout followers to rage. Throwing rocks and setting fires, they shut down Bangalore -- one of Asia's most dynamic, modern cities, with a population of about five million -- for two full days. Schools and colleges were closed there for two weeks and reopened only this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gopal, a Tamil, said in a diary of the case in Outlook magazine that he agreed to take on the job as emissary after the chief minister of Tamil Nadu told him that the safety of hundreds of thousands of Tamils in Karnataka was at stake.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gopal, who had negotiated the release of an earlier group of Mr. Veerappan's hostages, described his first foray into the jungle, from Aug. 7 to 9, as beginning in a tribal hut.</p>
        <p>''Late evening, as darkness envelops the forests, Veerappan's men lead me and my team,'' he wrote. ''We begin walking. It seems like an endless journey. Finally, we halt for the night. It is uncomfortable. Insect bites make my skin itch perpetually. I can't sleep.''</p>
        <p>When he finally reached Mr. Veerappan the next day, he said, he found him a changed man -- indeed the police describe a man worn out from a life on the run, suffering from asthma and a bad stomach. ''Gone is his swagger and gay abandon,'' Mr. Gopal wrote. ''He is more serious and stiff.'' This new man also speaks ''as if he is the sole representative of the Tamils.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Rajkumar, on his 10th day of captivity, seemed to the magazine editor to have ''fallen in love with life in the jungle.'' He spoke in fluent Tamil of its lush natural beauty, of his long chats with his abductors and of his close association with Tamils.</p>
        <p>''I have heard about the Stockholm syndrome,'' Mr. Gopal wrote dryly, referring to the development of a bond between hostages and kidnappers. ''Probably this is it.''</p>
        <p>After two rounds of talks, Mr. Gopal headed back to civilization.</p>
        <p>And now, as he heads back into the depths of jungle, India waits for the next chapter of the saga.</p>
