      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Actor as Host And Advice Giver</p>
        <p>ALEC BALDWIN, back in Manhattan after five weeks of filming ''Pearl Harbor'' in Mexico with BEN AFFLECK, was the host at a reception yesterday marking the beginning of the 35th-anniversary celebration of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.</p>
        <p>''We're raising the violet on Central Park South'' (a reference to N.Y.U.'s colors, which are violet and white), Mr. Baldwin said before the reception at Atlas, a restaurant on Central Park South that is owned by DALE and ELIZABETH HEMMERDINGER. Mr. Hemmerdinger is a trustee of the university; Mrs. Hemmerdinger is on the dean's council at the Tisch School.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baldwin said he hears about the Tisch School's world-class reputation from friends. ''The things people say they will do for me or to me to get their kids into the directing program are mind-boggling.''</p>
        <p>He said he had enjoyed working with Mr. Affleck. ''I see a lot of myself in him when I was his age,'' Mr. Baldwin said.</p>
        <p>''He knows how political I am, and he turned to me and he said, 'I'm thinking myself of going into politics.'</p>
        <p>''I wanted to grab him by the throat and say, 'Don't you dare,' meaning, 'There's plenty of time. You can do that when you're 50, but now, go make some money and be a movie star.' ''</p>
        <p>The Mayor Uses A J.F.K. Example</p>
        <p>MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI joked yesterday that when he names his new police commissioner, he will handle the announcement the way President Kennedy talked about handling an announcement of a high-level appointment 40 years ago.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the great stories,'' the mayor said during a question-and-answer session in the Blue Room at City Hall.</p>
        <p>''When President Kennedy named his brother as attorney general, they were expecting a tremendous amount of possible criticism, you know, because it was his brother: was he qualified, wasn't he qualified.''</p>
        <p>In the story, as told by Ben Bradlee, Kennedy's friend and at the time a Newsweek reporter, the president said, ''I think I'll open the front door of the Georgetown house some morning about 2 a.m., look up and down the street, and if there's no one there I'll whisper, 'It's Bobby.' ''</p>
        <p>The mayor told reporters, ''So there's a hint.''</p>
        <p>A reporter asked if that meant he planned to pick DENNISON YOUNG JR., a longtime adviser. The mayor said no. Another asked if he was signaling that he planned to name his brother.</p>
        <p>''Yes, my long-lost brother,'' the mayor joked. ''Page 167 of Wayne Barrett's book,'' a reference to ''Rudy! An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani,'' which describes the mayor's family history in extensive detail, tracking down cousins who Mr. Barrett said were involved with organized crime.</p>
        <p>Another reporter asked if the mayor had considered any women for the job. ''Have I considered any women?'' he asked. ''You'd sure like to get me in trouble.</p>
        <p>''I'm in enough trouble,'' he said. ''I mean, I don't need that.'' Then he turned serious: ''Yes, of course I have, actually. I have considered several women candidates.''</p>
        <p>Safir &amp; Friend</p>
        <p>Today is HOWARD SAFIR'S last workday as police commissioner, but not his last day as a dog walker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir, who is 6 feet 3 1/2 inches tall, is often seen around his Upper East Side neighborhood with his Lhasa apso, which is perhaps 10 inches tall and weighs less than 10 pounds.</p>
        <p>He says people do double takes at the sight of him with a dog he says is ''the size of a mop -- a small mop.''</p>
        <p>''They very often tell me they would expect to see me with a police dog,'' he said. ''A German shepherd. And they say, 'You walk your own dog? You pick up after your own dog?' I tell them, 'Who else is going to do it?' ''</p>
        <p>An Atlantic Defeat</p>
        <p>The first man-and-woman team to try to cross the Atlantic by rowing from Nefoundland to Ireland has given up. COLLEEN CRONIN of Bayside, Queens, and ROY FINLAY, a former diver in the British Royal Navy, sent an e-mail message late Wednesday saying they had turned back after 19 days in a 26-foot-long boat.</p>
        <p>''Don't know if you all realize what the weather really has been like out here,'' Ms. Cronin said by e-mail. ''We have had no luck since Day 2. For days we sat and waited.''</p>
        <p>She said they had turned around Saturday, but waited to send word because ''our decision was not final'' until Wednesday.</p>
        <p>A Concorde Aloft</p>
        <p>The Concorde has disappeared from the sky, but not from Times Square. British Airways has ''absolutely no plans'' to take down the half-size model on 42nd Street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue.</p>
        <p>''It's our image,'' said JOHN LAMPL, a British Airways spokesman, adding that the airline hoped the suspension of the Concorde's flights would not be permanent.</p>
        <p>Its place in Times Square is not permanent, either. It will come down in April, he said.''That's been the plan for however many years now, because there's going to be a new building going up there.''</p>
