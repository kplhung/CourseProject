        <p>Advisers to Gov. George W. Bush said today that he would participate in three presidential debates, an announcement clearly intended to blunt a drumbeat of criticism from the campaign of his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, that Mr. Bush was trying to avoid such face-to-face contests.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's advisers left open the question of whether those debates would be the ones suggested by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which sponsored all of the post-primaries presidential debates since 1988.</p>

        <p>Advisers to Gov. George W. Bush said today that he would participate in three presidential debates, an announcement clearly intended to blunt a drumbeat of criticism from the campaign of his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, that Mr. Bush was trying to avoid such face-to-face contests.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's advisers left open the question of whether those debates would be the ones suggested by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which sponsored all of the post-primaries presidential debates since 1988.</p>
        <p>In so doing, Mr. Bush and his advisers were obviously trying to retain either some bargaining power over the length, format and other aspects of the commission's debates or the option of looking to other sponsors for debates that better suited the campaign's desires.</p>
        <p>''Governor Bush wants a thoughtful debate,'' said Karen P. Hughes, a top Bush campaign adviser, ''and we feel that as the nominee, he should have some input into the structure and format of the debates.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes pitched the announcement that Mr. Bush would participate in three debates and that his running mate, Dick Cheney, would take part in two vice-presidential debates as ''a modern-day record,'' noting that the pair's five debates would be the most in over 30 years.</p>
        <p>But several Republican strategists said the Bush campaign was clearly concerned about making sure Mr. Bush ended up in the debate formats that flattered him the most.</p>
        <p>They said this reflected both an awareness among Mr. Bush's advisers that debates were not necessarily his best showcases and the fact that the front runner, which polls show the governor to be, typically has more to lose than gain from debates.</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, a Gore campaign spokesman, noted that Mr. Gore had long ago publicly agreed to all three debates suggested by the commission, and dozens of other debates.  ''The more, the merrier,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And the chairman of the Gore campaign, William M. Daley, released a statement late today saying that the campaign had told the debates commission it was ready ''to meet with them tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>The Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group, has proposed presidential debates on Oct. 3 in Boston, Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 in St. Louis.</p>
