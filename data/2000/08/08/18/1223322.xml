        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Reprise Room at Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes, which focuses on what Mr. Comstock calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, whose creamy baritone echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Today and Monday through Wednesday at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $50 and $55; premium ringside seating, $75 and $80 (Stephen Holden).</p>

        <p>MARC SALEM, Feinstein's, at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. Marc Salem is the mental magician who dazzled audiences at the Westside Theater in Midtown with his 1997 show ''Mind Games.'' Now, Mr. Salem, accompanied by a bass, piano and percussion trio, is in residence at Feinstein's with ''Mind Games and All That Jazz.'' But handsome as it is, Feinstein's at the Regency may not be the ideal setting for the display of Mr. Salem's enjoyable bag of tricks. The intimacy of Feinstein's, where Mr. Salem seems to be working with a smaller palette than at the Westside Theater, detracts from the aura of magic that can surround, say, a wristwatch that suddenly changes the time it displays. The jazz trio Vibrations, as pleasant and talented as it is, provides little more than a few attractive introductory numbers and a bit of musical commentary of the ''Twilight Zone'' sort. Nevertheless, Mr. Salem and his wizardry provide cool fun for hot summer nights. Fridays and Saturdays at 8:30 and 11 p.m.; Sundays at 1:30 p.m.; Wednesday and Thursdays at 8:30 p.m. Cover: $40 on weekends; no cover on weekdays; dinner required for early show on weekends, with seating beginning at 6; a la carte supper menu with $20 minimum for late show; $35 for early show; Sunday brunch is $30 and cover is $30. Through Sept. 2 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>* BILLY STRITCH, Firebird Cafe, 363 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 586-0244. Mr. Stritch is a pop-jazz smoothie who is gaining in vocal confidence and personality as he matures. His astute, far-reaching taste in songs runs from Brazilian bossa nova (Ivan Lins's ''Sails'') to Mel Torme signatures like ''Green Dolphin Street'' and ''Mountain Greenery.'' Mr. Stritch's meaty pianism gives them all a charge of adrenaline. High points are two little-known gems: the bitter Carmen McRae-identified ''I Have the Feeling I've Been Here Before,'' by Roger Kellaway and Alan and Marilyn Bergman, and ''Meantime,'' a tough, smart, live-for-the-moment anthem by Robert Allen and Al Stillman. Tonight at 9 and 11. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Also at Firebird: tomorrow night at 9, Natalie Douglas, singer. Cover: $20; $15 minimum. Tomorrow night at 11, Alton F.
