        <p>When Sean Payton, the Giants' new offensive coordinator, sat down last winter to retool the team's playbook, he identified running back Sean Bennett as the offense's most underused player.</p>
        <p>With a unique combination of attributes -- speed, good hands and a large 230-pound frame -- Bennett could be a secret weapon as a pass-catching threat out of the backfield, as a receiver split wide and even as a tight end, Payton was certain. Payton glowed when he talked about the matchup problems Bennett could create for opposing defenses and whole sections of the Giants' play book were invented specifically for Bennett.</p>
        <p>It now appears that Bennett will almost certainly miss the 2000 season with major knee surgery. Giants Coach Jim Fassel announced after today's final training-camp practice that the team's medical staff had determined that Bennett needed the season-ending surgery to correct damage to his right knee that includes a medial collateral ligament strain.</p>
        <p>Bennett, who said there were ''some other factors inside the knee'' causing him discomfort, said he was seeking a second medical opinion before agreeing to the surgery. ''I'm unhappy because I want to play,'' said Bennett, who as a rookie last season missed seven games with a strain of the same ligament. ''As a football player, you want to play through the pain.''</p>
        <p>But there is little precedent for Giants players going against their own doctors' advice. Bennett may be disheartened that his season appears over, but the Giants invested a fourth-round 1999 draft pick in him and since Bennett is only 24 years old, the team will most likely be most concerned about the long-term condition of his knee when deciding if he should play this year.</p>
        <p>Fassel, whose Giants play their annual preseason game with the Jets Friday night at Giants Stadium, declined to discuss Bennett's injury or its effect on the team, other than to confirm that it was Bennett's decision to seek a second opinion.</p>
        <p>Fassel said Bennett had injured the knee on the first play of the team's initial preseason game against Chicago on Aug. 5.</p>
        <p>''I was blocking for Tiki Barber and someone rolled up on my leg,'' Bennett said.</p>
        <p>Bennett continued to play and practice after being injured, including a few plays in last week's preseason game against the Jaguars in Jacksonville, but he sought out the team's doctors for an M.R.I. test last weekend when swelling in his knee started moving up into his thigh.</p>
        <p>Bennett, who came into training camp with a sore back that kept him out of several practices, said he kept playing on a sore knee in part because he felt he been injured too often already.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want anybody to think I was a soft player,'' Bennett said. ''I had worked so hard in the off-season to be strong and healthy. The trainers said I might have worked even too hard. I guess this has kind of backfired on me.''</p>
        <p>The Giants will find it hard to replace Bennett with anyone now on their roster. Barber can do many of the things Bennett can, but Barber's role was already being expanded in other ways that included rushing the football as much as 10 times a game. Barber is also the principal punt returner. But since he weighs 192 pounds, he would not be asked to play as an H-back or a tight end, because it requires a different style of blocking.</p>
        <p>The Giants could wait for an experienced and able pass-catching running back to be cut by another team, but it takes weeks to learn the nuances of the position in a new and fairly complex offense like Payton's. With pass-catching tight end Pete Mitchell already sidelined with a knee injury that could keep him out of one or two regular-season games, the Giants may have to temporarily alter some of their grander offensive plans; they may rely more on Barber, the rookie running back Ron Dayne and their blossoming wide receivers, Amani Toomer, Ike Hilliard and Joe Jurevicius. But in recent weeks, the Giants coaches have insisted that one of their goals this year was not to simplify the offense as they have in previous seasons.</p>
        <p>''It would be a big blow for us if Sean is out for any extended amount of time,'' Giants quarterback Kerry Collins said today. ''Sean was a guy we were counting on to create matchup problems. There were things, like a three running back set, that were in there basically for Sean.''</p>
        <p>Joe Montgomery, who began taking some snaps in the fullback position last week, is another option for the Giants. He has the size and is quick -- though not as fast as Bennett. Montgomery has displayed decent hands as a receiver in training camp, but he lacks experience since he did not catch a pass last season. Going back to his collegiate career, Montgomery has also been injury prone, and last season he missed nine games with two leg injuries.</p>
