        <p>SAY what you will about the New York International Fringe Festival, it is, without a doubt, the only place in the city you can see a Hungarian adaptation of a Greek epic performed in (what else?) German.</p>
        <p>That's right. For a limited time only, it's ''Die Ungarische Medea,'' written by none other than Arpad Goncz, who recently stepped down as president of Hungary. (The Fringe had nothing to do with his resignation, festival officials say.)</p>

        <p>SAY what you will about the New York International Fringe Festival, it is, without a doubt, the only place in the city you can see a Hungarian adaptation of a Greek epic performed in (what else?) German.</p>
        <p>That's right. For a limited time only, it's ''Die Ungarische Medea,'' written by none other than Arpad Goncz, who recently stepped down as president of Hungary. (The Fringe had nothing to do with his resignation, festival officials say.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Goncz's play is just one of scores of shows now on the Fringe, the annual two-week downtown theater festival that revels in all things dramatic and different.</p>
        <p>How different? Well, a quick glance at this year's schedule includes ''I Am Star Trek,'' a staged biography of Gene Roddenberry, creator of that television series; ''Frankenclown,'' an evil-clown show promising ''several slayings and raucous laughter''; and of course the Tiny Ninja Theater, which will perform ''Macbeth'' using nothing but 100 tiny plastic ninjas, several miniature aliens and a pair of Mr. and Mrs. Smile dolls. (They play the Macbeths.)</p>
        <p>All in all, the Fringe festival, which began on Wednesday and runs through Aug. 27, will present 180 shows in 20 theaters at more than a dozen locations on the Lower East Side, in the East Village and nearby. Every day the Fringe will present almost 80 performances, staged by some 2,000 artists from 12 countries and overseen by a volunteer staff of 400. Even veterans of the Fringe, now in its fourth year, are a little awestruck by the numbers.</p>
        <p>''Every day I am absolutely certain there is no way it is possibly going to happen,'' said John Clancy, the festival's artistic director, while reclining in the Fringe's makeshift cafe, enjoying a cigarette. ''And yet somehow every day it does.''</p>
        <p>Considering the scope of the Fringe's schedule, you might think that every little-known actor, writer and director in the city was booked. But the Fringe is only one of several theater festivals running around the city.</p>
        <p>They include a newcomer, the Midtown International Theater Festival, and a recent upstart, the Pure Pop festival, as well as two more established ones: the American Living Room, a seven-week festival of theater, film and puppetry at the Here Theater in the South Village, and the Blueprint Series at the Ontological Theater in the East Village, which concentrates on the work of new experimental playwrights and directors. Two other downtown festivals, the Summer Camp series at SoHo Rep and the Ice Factory at the Ohio Theater, just finished their annual runs.</p>
        <p>With budgets less than the cast-party tabs for most Broadway shows, these festivals make August the busiest month for the myriad low-budget, bighearted theaters collectively known as Off Off Broadway. The timing, of course, is hardly coincidental; August is traditionally a slow time for Broadway and Off Broadway, leaving smaller theaters a prime opportunity to fill the gap.</p>
        <p>''August has become festival season downtown, the one moment when all the little theaters in town celebrate their vibrant little community,'' said Aaron Beall, a longtime Off Off producer who founded the Pure Pop festival. ''We were able to find one of the last slots available on the calendar, the one slot no one else would touch, and we made it our own.''</p>
        <p>All the festivals share common characteristics. First and foremost is their ticket prices, which are, in short, cheap. None of the festivals have tickets more expensive than $12, and some shows are free.</p>
        <p>Even Air-Conditioning</p>
        <p>Not that production values are completely threadbare. Despite Off Off Broadway's ragtag image, many theaters involved in the festivals are increasingly sophisticated, with air-conditioning, cushioned seats and elaborate technical setups.</p>
        <p>''We are emphasizing our location, our convenience and our safety,'' said John Chatterton, the founder of the Midtown festival. ''And our A.C.''</p>
        <p>And while all of the festivals' founders would claim their own aesthetics, each festival has at least one show that falls into this venerable category: the show with the outrageous title.</p>
        <p>Audiences of the avant-garde apparently love a goofy title, which avant-garde artists are apparently plenty willing to provide. Into this vast phylum fall entries like this year's ''Clowns in the Vagina,'' another evil-clown show at the Fringe; ''The Hobo Got Too High,'' a Pure Pop entry about a cocaine addict named Bug Blowmonkey; and ''I Didn't Ask for Bare-Chested Men Singing Doo-Wop,'' a Fringe show that is described as a farce and may well be.</p>
        <p>The award for the oddest title, however, goes to the Neo-Futurists, a Chicago-based comedy troupe playing the Fringe. The show is ''The Complete Lost Works of Samuel Beckett as Found in an Envelope (Partially Burned) in a Dustbin in Paris Labeled: 'Never to Be Performed. Never. Ever. Ever. Or I'll Sue. I'll Sue From the Grave.' '' True to form, it has been one of the Fringe's hottest tickets.</p>
        <p>The newest of the bunch is the Midtown festival, a monthlong affair featuring 19 productions at four black-box theaters in the West 40's.</p>
        <p>The festival, which began on Aug. 9 and runs through Sept. 3, was founded by Mr. Chatterton, an Off Off Broadway playwright who is banking -- the festival's $30,000 budget comes mostly out of his pocket -- on the idea that the theater lovers who go to Midtown for Broadway shows might take a chance on something a little less polished.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chatterton, who also publishes a weekly newsletter called the Off Off Broadway Review, said he started the festival after reading several articles about the Fringe festival. ''To be honest,'' he said, ''I thought I could do it better.''</p>
        <p>In part, he said, that's because his tastes differ from the Fringe's. ''I am slightly more middle-of-the-road,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To that end, the Midtown festival has booked productions of Shakespeare, Shaw and Beckett. But it also includes potential modern epics like ''Stopless Go-Go Girls at the Troll Hole,'' the heartwarming story of a group of topless dancers and their loyal, leather-loving clientele. (''A could-be cult classic,'' reads its news release. Time will tell.)</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Chatterton has been trumpeting his theaters' air-conditioning, at one of the festival's theaters last week those same units blew a fuse during a performance of Harold Pinter's ''Lover.'' After two false starts and several expletives from the technical booth, the actors soldiered on under house lights. About five minutes into the show, the stage lights came back on.</p>
        <p>Such experiences have made Mr. Chatterton somewhat more humble, he said.</p>
        <p>''I have a far greater appreciation and respect,'' he said, with a laugh, ''for what they've been doing at the Fringe.''</p>
        <p>Up From the Basement</p>
        <p>Mr. Chatterton is hardly the first to challenge the Fringe. That honor would belong to Mr. Beall, the proprietor of Todo Con Nada, a basement theater on Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side. Mr. Beall (pronounced bell) was also a Fringe co-founder, but he started the Pure Pop festival after he had a falling out with Mr. Clancy over the Fringe festival's direction.</p>
        <p>So using the pseudonym Lestar Bang, he founded his own festival, complete with visions of a 24-hour theater delicatessen, a yearlong schedule of productions and a vast Internet network of support services for Off Off Broadway companies.</p>
        <p>Not all of that panned out, but this year Mr. Beall is back with another ambitious slate of productions, some 20 shows including a series of Chekhov shorts, a Richard Foreman play and several stagings of the horrible horror films of the cult movie director Edward D. Wood Jr.</p>
        <p>On a shoestring budget, all of Pure Pop's shows are being presented at either Nada or Mr. Beall's newest theater, Show World, which he carved out of an unseemly corner of the former sex shop with that name on Eighth Avenue near 42nd Street.</p>
        <p>And while other festivals delegate artistic responsibilities, more than half the productions at Pure Pop are being directed by Mr. Beall, a director named Frank Cwiklik (not another pseudonym, Mr. Beall assures) and Ian W. Hill, Mr. Beall's protege, a man so devoted to the theater that he long lived in a large, rat-proof cage in the basement of Nada.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill's rugged living situation notwithstanding, for sheer perseverance, it's still hard to beat the Fringe.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year it looked as if the festival might not happen. The Present Company, the producer of the Fringe, had serious money troubles that almost caused it to lose the Theatorium, its 5,000-square-foot home and the Fringe headquarters.</p>
        <p>''There were some very bad days,'' said Elena K. Holy, the festival's producing director.</p>
        <p>Part of those problems came from the growth of the Fringe. In 1997, when it was founded, the budget was $74,000; this year, its fourth, the figure is $250,000.</p>
        <p>This year's schedule, for example, includes a raft of nontheatrical programming, including a literary reading series (FringeInk), a visual art exhibition (FringeArt) and a children's theater program (FringeJr.).</p>
        <p>The main emphasis, however, remains the shows, which as usual run the gamut. A casual visitor to a theater at, say, 5 p.m. on a Tuesday might encounter a puppet show (''Doctor Faustus''), a comedy troupe (''The Chainsaw Boys'') or the obligatory paean to Elvis (''Viva Los Alamos''). Come back an hour later, and the theater might be home to an actual play (''Buddy Movie''), a new musical (''To Sirloin With Love: A Meat Opera'') or even an old-fashioned revival (George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber's 1936 backstage comedy ''Stage Door'').</p>
        <p>Life Beyond the Fringe</p>
        <p>Most of these shows are performed a few times, then disappear without a trace. Some, however, have proved to have lives beyond the Fringe, including last year's ''Never Swim Alone,'' currently in a commercial run at the SoHo Playhouse, and the 1999 gag musical ''Urinetown,'' which is gearing up for its own Off Broadway run.</p>
        <p>The Fringe has also begun to pick up some higher-profile uptown partners, including the Drama League and the Ensemble Studio Theater, both of which are producing several short plays at the festival. It also received technical support from Off Broadway companies like the Joseph Papp Public Theater, the Vineyard Theater and the American Place Theater.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest change, however, is that for the first time the New York International Fringe Festival is actually living up to its name.</p>
        <p>''International,'' Mr. Clancy explains, ''used to mean a couple of guys from Toronto.''</p>
        <p>This year, however, there are 30 international shows -- ''coming over actual seas,'' he said -- giving the schedule a multilingual feel.</p>
        <p>Global Outrageousness</p>
        <p>International entries include ''Ha! Hamlet,'' a two-person version from Switzerland; ''Girobira,'' a performance art troupe from Bilbao, Spain; and something titled ''Synchronized Swimming: The Dry Version,'' also from Switzerland, proving the outrageous name theory transcends international borders.</p>
        <p>Organizers say there is also another new element to this year's festival: calm.</p>
        <p>''This is like senior year in high school,'' Mr. Clancy said. ''We know how to do it now.''</p>
        <p>Even as crews scurried around Fringe headquarters the other day, Mr. Clancy and Ms. Holy seemed unconcerned about any potential logistic land mines.</p>
        <p>''I can't tell if this is calm or exhaustion,'' Ms. Holy said. ''But it feels O.K.''</p>
        <p>But what of the art? Many of the companies are performing together for the first time. And more experienced troupes are trying out new material. Are the organizers concerned that some things may be, well, just plain bad?</p>
        <p>''I view it as a place for established artists to take risks,'' Mr. Clancy said, ''and emerging artists to work in a professional environment for the first time.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Holy thought for a moment, and added: ''And fun. The Fringe should be fun.''</p>
