        <p>For the second time in a year, New Jersey counties have been declared federal disaster areas by President Clinton, after severe flooding in  pockets of Sussex and Morris Counties over the weekend.</p>
        <p>The president's declaration makes property owners eligible for grants and loans to pay for flood-related damage not covered by private insurance. It also makes local, county and state agencies eligible for federal aid to cover the cost of overtime for police, rescue and other emergency services.</p>

        <p>For the second time in a year, New Jersey counties have been declared federal disaster areas by President Clinton, after severe flooding in  pockets of Sussex and Morris Counties over the weekend.</p>
        <p>The president's declaration makes property owners eligible for grants and loans to pay for flood-related damage not covered by private insurance. It also makes local, county and state agencies eligible for federal aid to cover the cost of overtime for police, rescue and other emergency services.</p>
        <p>Morris was among eight counties that President Clinton declared disaster areas last September, when record amounts of rain fell over broad swaths of New Jersey over several days during Tropical Storm Floyd.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's declaration by the president was in response to a request from Gov. Christine Todd Whitman that was supported by members of the state's Congressional delegation.</p>
        <p>The federal aid covers 75 percent of eligible damage and Governor Whitman said yesterday that the state would contribute the rest.</p>
