        <p>It's been a quiet week at the Highbridge public pool in Upper Manhattan. And a quiet month and, for that matter, a quiet summer.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, shortly after 11 a.m., the pool was freshly cleaned and open for business. The bottoms of the wading and Olympic-sized pools were newly vacuumed. The water was a brilliant, tantalizing blue. Two lifeguards were stationed at the high stands.</p>
        <p>But the surface remained as still as bathtub water. Not a soul was in the pool. Nor was there anybody poised to dive, or heading for the water, or even in the dressing rooms putting on bathing suits.</p>
        <p>''Boring,'' said Oscar Tineo, 17, perched on a lifeguard stand. ''My job is to watch the water and make sure everything is going well. If nobody is in the water, I have to wait for them to get in the water.''</p>
        <p>This summer, the 950 lifeguards at the city's 53 pools have been spending a lot of time waiting for swimmers to get into the water. Constant rain and relatively cool weather have been keeping people away. Last summer, two million people used the city pools. So far this year, the number is less than half that, although the recent clearing weather may draw more as the season winds down.</p>
        <p>At Highbridge, which can hold 2,234 people, the lifeguards were kept busy in the stifling hot summer of '99 keeping watch over a pool filled to capacity for days on end. Children shrieked and splashed in the pool as the overflow crowd waited outside for an hour or more for a chance to cool off.</p>
        <p>But this summer, the children and the others who sought relief last year have found other things to do. Only the regular pool users -- the hard-core lap-swimmers and the children in day camps who are bused to pools daily -- have turned out, except during the few hot and humid days so far in this tepid summer.</p>
        <p>Still, lifeguards cannot stay home just because the swimmers do. Their duties are to guard the pool, the deck and the swimmers. And if nobody happens to be swimming, if the pool clearly and unarguably contains nothing but water, they still have the pool and the deck to protect.</p>
        <p>The city requires that two lifeguards remain on watch, even when the pool is empty. If there is even one swimmer, four lifeguards must take their posts, and remain vigilant --  no distractions like magazines, crossword puzzles or Walkmans are permitted.</p>
        <p>While some people might like to stare fixedly at a silent pool of blue, blue water --  Zen meditators, say, or poets grasping for the perfect phrase -- Mr. Tineo, like most lifeguards, likes action. Musing on the occasional bird flying past is not his idea of a challenge. For the Highbridge lifeguards, the frequent rain is turning a pleasurably pressured, high-adrenaline job -- where saving a life or two is all in a day's work -- into a dreary chore.</p>
        <p>''Being like this, no work, people think it's easier,'' said Emmanuel Disla, the lieutenant, or foreman, of the Highbridge pool lifeguards. ''It's not. It's harder. We have to come to work but we don't have people to work with.''</p>
        <p>Leaning against the wall of the lifeguards' little locker room, Mr. Disla smiled as he recalled the worst hot day last summer. ''Oh, man, it was crazy,'' he said, sounding as if he was thinking back on a great, wild party.  ''People in the pool, people on the deck, people all over.''</p>
        <p>When the pool is jammed with thousands of people, rescues can happen two or three times a day, said Michael Terrero, a city lifeguard for eight years. ''There's a kind of pride,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It just feels good to pull somebody out,'' added Carlos Silva, 26, a fellow lifeguard. ''And the people are clapping and cheering.''</p>
        <p>While the work might pick up for the lifeguards this week -- the forecast calls for temperatures in the 80's and higher humidity -- Sunday was, quite definitely, not a day for swimming.</p>
        <p>By noon, the drizzle had turned to a fairly heavy downpour. Eight lifeguards were on duty. While one guarded the deck, seven others were crammed inside the tight locker room. ''Maybe we'll pick up in here,'' said one. ''It's kind of a mess.''</p>
        <p>The remainder of the day would be spent studying and practicing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, Mr. Disla said. And if the rain continued, each would take a one-hour shift outside, pacing the deck in a rain slicker.</p>
        <p>The noon shift was Mr. Tineo's. He was pacing the deck, alone. Encased in a yellow rain slicker, his face hidden by the hood, he looked more like a Capuchin monk in prayer than a bored young lifeguard.</p>
        <p>''Yes, you find peace,'' he said. ''But you don't want to find it because you want to do your job. I would like the hot days to come back so people can have fun and I can be blowing my whistle -- nee! nee! nee! -- and be ready to jump in and help them.''</p>
