        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>CARL ALLEN AND THE NEW SPIRITS, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Allen, a drummer who has played with just about everybody who's emerged in the last 15 years of jazz, has convened a band of young and middle-aged lions; you're going to see a lot of terrifically competent playing here, and since things are loose in these supergroups, it could be a lot better than that. With Nicholas Payton on trumpet, Donald Harrison on alto saxophone, Eric Reed on piano and Robert Hurst III on bass. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $25 cover for the two early shows and $18 for the midnight show; Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with an $18 cover for each; there is also a $10 minimum for all shows (Ben Ratliff).</p>

        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>CARL ALLEN AND THE NEW SPIRITS, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Allen, a drummer who has played with just about everybody who's emerged in the last 15 years of jazz, has convened a band of young and middle-aged lions; you're going to see a lot of terrifically competent playing here, and since things are loose in these supergroups, it could be a lot better than that.

        <p>DAEVID ALLEN, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Daevid Allen led Gong, a lighthearted and lightheaded psychedelic band that built a mythology of flying teapots and pothead pixies while rambling from rock into jazz. He has never lost his whimsy; his current group is the University of Errors. Tomorrow night at 10 p.m.; admission is $10 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>BOSS HOG, DELTA 72, Mercury Lounge, 217 Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Christina Martinez and Jon Spencer of Boss Hog are happy parents now, but that doesn't mean they don't still rock hard. Their band's latest album, ''Whiteout'' (In the Red), does the girl-group thing in a futuristic East Village style. Sharing Boss Hogg's ''brand new it's retro'' aesthetic, and tonight's bill, is Philadelphia's own gospel-punk outfit Delta 72. Lo Hi opens the show. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $12 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>COUNTING CROWS, LIVE, GALACTIC, Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000. Counting Crows set off the 1990's folk-rock resurgence with songs that give Adam Duritz's whining a tuneful, familiar-sounding cocoon. Live ponders cosmic questions in burly, resonant rock. And Galactic, the odd band on this bill, plays New Orleans-rooted funk that should get people dancing before the other bands' self-importance takes over. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $25 to $46.50 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>HANK CRAWFORD, JIMMY McGRIFF, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080. Mr. Crawford, the alto saxophonist who was part of Ray Charles's mighty big band of the early 60's, made some of his own fine records on Atlantic. Here he is paired with Mr. McGriff, the organist who is a patron saint of the ever-renewing groove-music scene. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover is $25, with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* DMC/TECHNICS WORLD D.J. CHAMPIONSHIP, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan., (212) 777-6800. The art of turntablism -- which involves scratching, cutting, fading between records on two turntables, and any invented device therefrom -- relies on sleight-of-hand tricks that don't really grow more profound over the years. But this, the country's most organized contest of turntablism, is more than just a gadget demo. The DMC championship shows are convergences of hip-hop obsessives, young guys with baseball caps and a pronounced love for the old school. The host for the evening is always an eminence gris with a lot of history to impart (this year it's D.J. Red Alert); there's a touching induction ceremony for the DMC Hall of Fame (tomorrow's inductees include Jazzy Jeff and the brilliant Marley Marl). Then there are the championship performances themselves, three-minute shows of furious homemade ingenuity. Sure, it's vaudeville. But at least one D.J. a year really knows how to rock a crowd and pin your ears back. The defending American champ is P-Trix, from Los Angeles's Immortal Fader Fyters crew; hometown favorites will be Mysterio from Plainfield, N.J., Gambit from Atlantic City and Tragik from Long Island. The contest is tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25, from the Irving Plaza box office, or from Ticketmaster, (212) 307-7200 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>DREAMS COME TRUE CONCERT, Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741. If your fantasies involve fashionably smooth rhythm-and-blues with a hint of hip-hop, then the title of this concert applies. The highlight will certainly be a performance by Kelly Price, who blows away anyone within earshot of the stage when she does these multiartist bills. Romance-seekers will enjoy Carl Thomas, Ginuwine, Donnell Jones and Chico DeBarge as well. And Lil' Mo will bring on the rhymes. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $60.50 to $75.50 (Powers).</p>
        <p>ELLINGTON FOREVER, Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Though the group's name can leave you without hope as to when we might see fewer tributes in jazz, you can't really go wrong with this bunch of players: the pianist Sir Roland Hanna; the saxophonist Jimmy Heath, whose brief festival appearances in June were outstanding; the saxophonist and flutist Frank Wess; the bassist Ray Drummond; and the drummer Kenny Washington. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8:45, 10:45 and 12:15; cover charge is $25, with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>JOHN FOGERTY, AARON NEVILLE, DR. JOHN, Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y. (516) 221-1000. The concert is billed as ''Destination: New Orleans,'' and the title is two-thirds accurate. In one of the many hits John Fogerty wrote for Creedence Clearwater Revival, he sang that he was ''Born on a Bayou,'' but he's actually from California. Still, his rockabilly guitar lines and rip-roaring voice are the stuff swamp fantasies are made of. Sharing the bill are two musicians with impeccable Crescent City credentials: Aaron Neville of the Neville Brothers, whose tremulous ballads hold worlds of vulnerability, and Dr. John, the growly-voice piano wizard who splashes barrelhouse flourishes over songs that could hold voodoo secrets. Sunday night at 7; tickets are $20 to $42 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>FU MANCHU, Wetlands Preserve, 161 Hudson Street, at Laight Street, TriBeCa, (212) 966-4225. These Southern California connoisseurs of van culture and 70's heavy-metal seem involved in a mixture of parody and seriousness, and their music contains the uneasiness of that balance. It's all two guitars riffing in medium-to-slow unison, a drummer who thinks cowbells are cool and warped poetry about the open road. On Sunday night doors open at 8, and the group goes on at 11; tickets are $12 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* GREAT JAZZ ON THE GREAT HILL, Great Hill, Central Park, 106th Street and Central Park West, (212) 875-5108. The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, just back from a summer tour, lands in New York to play a program of Ellington, Monk and other composers; these guys can be pretty impressive when they're still riding high form a few weeks of performances. Opening is the Machito Orchestra, directed by Mario Grillo, which will doubtless restage some of the Machito band's music from the 1940's and 50's, some of the greatest popular music known to man. It's a free concert, presented by Jazz at Lincoln Center, tomorrow from 4 to 7:30 p.m.; rain date is Sunday (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>GUSTER, JAYHAWKS, Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield at 72nd Street, mid-park, (212) 360-2777. You may never have heard of Guster, but many, many college-age fans of jangly rock have, and they will be out in force to help their band earn some dough for the venerable summer-concert series. The Jayhawks, who have been doing what Guster does much longer (and do it much better) open the show. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $22 (Powers).</p>
        <p>CHARLES McPHERSON QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Though Charles McPherson has always been associated with Charlie Parker for his rapid-note alto saxophone style and bebop harmonies, his live shows have an overlay of another Charlie: Mingus, in whose band he played in the 1960's and 70's. Sets through Sunday night are at 9:30 and 11:30, with a 1 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $20 ($15 on Sunday) with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>MACHEL MONTANO AND XTATIK, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Machel Montano leads Xtatik, a soca band for the video era. The Trinidadian grooves are bright and pushy, chanted lyrics urge everybody to dance, and smiley performers stake out formations onstage. Tonight at midnight and 2 a.m.; admission is $22 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>ROOTS OF AMERICAN MUSIC: CANADIAN DREAMCATCHERS, Lincoln Center Out of Doors Festival, (212) 875-5108. If you thought you had to hop an ocean to get real Celtic flavor, then obviously you haven't spent time in  Canada. It's teeming with fiddlers, cloggers, reelers and jiggers, and it has its share of singing cowboys and 1960's-style folkies, too. This gathering features a smorgasbord of sound from around the provinces. At the North Plaza, Garnet Rogers does the folk thing, J. P. Cormier offers some modernized Cape Breton-style fiddling, and James Keelaghan and Oscar Lopez do the dueling guitar thing by way of Calgary. Then the Damrosch Park band shell plays host to the city-style Celtic sounds of Tanglefoot from Ontario, the entertaining Matapat from Quebec, and the queen of all Canadian traditional music mavens, Natalie MacMaster, on the fiddle. Today at 4 p.m.; free (Powers).</p>
        <p>ROOTS OF AMERICAN MUSIC, Lincoln Center Out of Doors Festival, (212) 875-5108. This annual celebration of the down-home features blues tomorrow afternoon and storytelling songwriters in the evening. The afternoon program, on the North Plaza, begins tomorrow at 2 p.m. with Chuck Brodsky, followed at 3 by John Jackson, a guitarist from Virginia who fingerpicks gentle, ragtimey Piedmont blues. The Tarbox Ramblers, at 4 p.m., are four men who play prewar songs with fiddle and electric guitar; they are followed at 5 by the Music Maker Country Blues Review, with Cootie Stark, John Ferguson, B. B. Queen, Dan Omar, Tim Duffy and Mudcat. The evening program, in Damrosch Park, opens at 7:30 with Taxi Chain. Bruce Cockburn, one of Canada's best-known songwriters, performs at 8:30; his pointed but compassionate songs are backed by his unassuming virtuosity on guitar. At 9:30 Arlo Guthrie finishes the program with his wry songs and tall tales. Admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* DAVID SANCHEZ MELAZA SEXTET, GONZALO RUBALCABA TRIO, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. Mr. Sanchez, one of the most promising jazz saxophonists around, has shown a studious hunger in his investigation of Afro-Caribbean music and music of Latin America. On his new album, ''Melaza'' (Columbia Jazz/Sony), he continues in that vein, smartly using bits of traditional Puerto Rican instruments in a highly arranged jazz context. Gonzalo Rubalcaba, the Cuban pianist, has overwhelming keyboard flash at his command; most recently, though, he has been experimenting with almost weightless, slow-motion trio music, which can be surreally beautiful. Double-bill sets are tonight through Sunday night at 9 and 11:30; cover charge is $30, with a $5 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>JILL SOBULE, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055; Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. With a new album, ''Pink Pearl'' (Beyond Music), that shows her talents in their full maturity, Jill Sobule can claim her place among the stellar New York singer-songwriters of the last decade. Topical, funny and more than a little poignant, ''Pink Pearl'' is grown-up music for an adolescent age. Ms. Sobule will play from it and her older material at these shows. Tonight at the Knitting Factory at 10; admission is $12. Tomorrow at Maxwell's at 10; admission is $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* ROKIA TRAORE, Lincoln Center Out of Doors Festival, North Plaza, (212) 875-5108. Rokia Traore, from Mali, has a voice that's both delicate and impassioned. Her songs are cat's cradles of circling guitar lines, marimba patterns, rhythms tapped on a calabash and women's voices that harmonize and intertwine with hers. She subtly updates traditional styles while holding to their intricate clarity. Sunday at 3 p.m.; admission is free. The rain date is Aug. 21 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>WARM-UP 2000, P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. The clever folks at this groovy art museum have figured out a way to beat the lack of heat this summer: they had the design team called Shop install an ''urban beach,'' complete with wading pools and deck chairs, where crowds can gather to hear D.J.'s instead of the screaming kiddies and tanning studs one encounters in the Rockaways. Things should get hot with the inventive hip-hop crew Anti-Pop Consortium headlining, the preacher-poet Carl Hancock Rux collaborating with Arto Lindsay, and an opening set by Liminal. Tomorrow through Labor Day from 3 to 9 p.m.; admission is $5, $2 for students and the elderly (Powers).</p>
        <p>MARY WILSON, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. When Diana Ross left the Supremes in 1970, Mary Wilson, the only remaining original member, took over the group. She has hired a succession of singers, kept the costumes glittering and sung the old Holland-Dozier-Holland hits for 30 years. When Miss Ross offered her a reported $3 million to rejoin her and tour as the Supremes, Ms. Wilson refused; Miss Ross's tour was canceled midway through. Now Ms. Wilson's Supremes take their turn. Tomorrow night at 8 p.m and 10:30; admission is $40 and $20 standing (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* STEVE WILSON QUARTET, Up Over Jazz Cafe, 351 Flatbush Avenue, at Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 398-5413. It's good to have Mr. Wilson's own band performing again; the alto saxophonist is so busy with other bands -- these days, his main employer is Chick Corea -- that one seldom hears him as a leader. His sound is warm, human, light toned, fleet; he has dealt with the living landmarks of his instrument, Ornette Coleman and Wayne Shorter, as well as anyone out there today. His band, made up of musicians who have spent a long time in one another's company, is especially reactive; it includes the pianist Bruce Barth, the bassist Eric Revis and the drummer Adam Cruz. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 10:30 and midnight; cover charge is $15, with a $5 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>BERNIE WORRELL AND THE WOO WARRIORS, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. As the keyboardist in Parliament-Funkadelic, Bernie Worrell put the oozing, organic textures in the P-Funk groove machine. He can take credit for the slow-bubbling synthesizer bass lines that are still ubiquitous in hip-hop and rhythm-and-blues; he also has an encompassing knowledge of jazz, funk, gospel and rock that he tosses around lightly. Tomorrow night at 10; tickets are $12 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* NEIL YOUNG, THE PRETENDERS, PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 117 of the Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-0400. Neil Young is showing his avuncular side and touring with a group of old hands at Memphis soul and country: the keyboardist Spooner Oldham, who wrote (with Dan Penn) songs including ''Dark End of the Street''; the bassist Duck Dunn from Booker T. and the MG's; the widely recorded drummer Jim Keltner; and the guitarist and banjoist Ben Keith. Chrissie Hynde, who showed a generation of women how to lead a band, sings the Pretenders' songs, old and new, with their conviction intact. Tegan and Sarah open the show. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $30.25 to $130.50 (Pareles).</p>
