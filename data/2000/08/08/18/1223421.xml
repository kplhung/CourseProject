        <p>When Bruce R. Kaster started suing tire manufacturers more than a decade ago, he worked alone facing legions of lawyers hired by corporate conglomerates.</p>
        <p>Most often he went up against Michelin. Many cases were settled out of court, but of those that went to trial, Mr. Kaster lost more than he won. By his account, the companies' hired guns heckled him about the losses in front of his clients and stonewalled requests for information. He said they expected to wear him down until he folded and went away.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kaster did not go away. Instead, he pursued case after case. Win or lose, he held onto case documents and stacks of depositions and trial testimony. Before long, he had crammed hundreds of thousands of pages into his offices in Ocala, a rural horse-farm community in central Florida.</p>
        <p>He set about schooling himself in the process of tire manufacturing, meanwhile, watching videos, being tutored by experts and assiduously studying facets like how rubber adheres to metal. The more often corporate lawyers erected roadblocks, the more passionately Mr. Kaster set himself on the goal of knocking them down.</p>
        <p>To win that war, he realized he needed to collaborate with other trial lawyers, most often sharing his archives for no fee. This wellspring of data has helped win cases for him and others. ''These are multinational corporations,'' Mr. Kaster said. ''They thought, 'What do I have to worry about a small-town lawyer?' ''</p>
        <p>He does not mind being called a small-town lawyer, but the 54-year-old who has spent the last 25 years in Ocala prefers the term cowboy or Florida cracker. Most days he works in jeans and cowboy boots. He likes to spend his free time hunting hogs or tending cattle on a small ranch he owns. Once, with a friend, Mr. Kaster said he rode a horse into a bar, had a drink without dismounting, and rode back out.</p>
        <p>He needs the recreation to relax between courtroom battles. He is often on the road, backing up other lawyers rather than arguing cases himself. Because there is no commercial airline service in Ocala, he routinely drives an hour and 15 minutes to Orlando to fly to cities throughout the United States. (He drives a Ford Explorer, but replaced the Firestone tires with Pirellis and replaced the factory-installed shock absorbers with a heavy-duty alternative.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaster works as a consultant, prepping expert witnesses for trial or sitting as co-counsel. He and others in the tightly knit group of plaintiff's attorneys who go after tire makers exchange information. ''When we need something, we call him,'' says Randy James, a Kansas City, Mo., lawyer with 18 years of experience in tire-defect cases.</p>
        <p>A defense lawyer who has gone up against Mr. Kaster says it is his accumulated warehouse of documents and in-depth knowledge of tires that makes Mr. Kaster a threat to manufacturers, not his courtroom finesse.</p>
        <p>''They are worried he's got something that will hurt them,'' said the lawyer, who spoke on the condition his name be withheld. ''He's a great librarian, not necessarily a field marshal in the tactics and strategy of the courtroom.''</p>
        <p>Even his critics concede that Mr. Kaster is tenacious and often successful in his efforts to uncover details about tire defects. Over six months in 1998, he made repeated trips to Decatur, Ill., seeking evidence about the Bridgestone Corporation factory there. He knocked on doors and spent hours at a Bob Evans restaurant sipping coffee with former employees to tease out information about suspected quality-control problems.</p>
        <p>The workers were willing to open up, Mr. Kaster said, in part because he had been a member of the Communications Workers of America union when he worked installing telephones while attending Virginia Tech. The Decatur Bridgestone workers had recently been embroiled in a labor dispute.</p>
        <p>''He's a bulldog in discovery,'' said David Steelman, executive director of Attorneys Information Exchange Group, a lawyer's forum on automobile and tire-defect cases, based in Birmingham, Ala. ''He stays with an issue until he gets the answers. He starts from ground zero and is relentless until he finds out what happened to cause the defect.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Steelman said Mr. Kaster had contributed the largest share of information to the exchange group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaster, who earned a law degree from the University of Florida after serving as a paratrooper in Vietnam, moved to Ocala in 1975 to work with Buddy McKay. Mr. McKay went on to serve as Florida's lieutenant governor under Lawton Chiles, then lost a bid for governor against Jeb Bush.</p>
        <p>At first, Mr. Kaster defended companies and insurers against lawsuits. He switched to plaintiff's work in the mid-1980's when a client at a factory he was defending asked him to help out relatives whose father had been killed in a car accident. Although he represented major insurers, Mr. Kaster took the case because the Canadian trucking company involved was covered by Lloyd's of London, which did not present a conflict. The company settled.</p>
        <p>Soon afterwards, Mr. Kaster took on his first tire case, suing the Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company on behalf of a teenage boy who had been rendered a paraplegic in an auto accident. Mr. Kaster battled with opposing lawyers over how many similar cases had been filed, and the company settled during jury deliberations for $2 million. There had never been even a million-dollar award in Ocala. He has had a few other big hits, including a $5 million verdict in a Connecticut case, but he says he spends much of his time providing information without compensation.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Kaster, in tandem with other lawyers, has four cases on the dockets, with a fifth set to be filed. All are against Bridgestone/Firestone.</p>
        <p>''I got angry about misleading and false information by the tire industry,'' Mr. Kaster said. ''I've stayed angry.''</p>
