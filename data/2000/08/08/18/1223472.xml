        <p>The last time the Liberty left Lake Erie with a loss, on July 3, the players were so distraught by their lackluster effort that they had a team meeting immediately upon returning to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The Liberty did not wait that long this time. Time is at a premium. The Cleveland Rockers whipped the Liberty tonight, 56-43, to seize the crucial lead in the two-of-three-game Eastern Conference finals. They established control from the opening minutes, throwing elbows, racing to every loose ball and looking as if they were wrestling in their living room that is Gund Arena, where the Rockers now boast a 16-3 record.</p>
        <p>''We stunk the arena up tonight,'' the Liberty captain, Teresa Weatherspoon, said crisply, between clenched teeth. After the loss, she closed the door to the visiting locker room and called her emergency meeting, addressing her teammates who sat stunned as they examined their bruises of mind and body.</p>
        <p>''Some things wake you up,'' Weatherspoon added. ''I tell you what, we're up. We closed the door. I talked to my team. I told them I still believe in them.''</p>
        <p>Cleveland, a team that had the worst record in the Women's National Basketball Association last year at 7-25, continued its surprising renaissance. Only the road, where they are 4-13, has stopped them this year.</p>
        <p>The Liberty players, meanwhile, return to the comfort of Madison Square Garden, where they have won 13 games and 11 straight, surprised to be facing elimination in Sunday's Game 2.</p>
        <p>''We're going home,'' said Weatherspoon, who had just 5 points and 3 assists. ''We've got a mission that needs to be accomplished and we can't let anyone get in our way.''</p>
        <p>But tonight, Cleveland did that squarely, outrebounding the Liberty, 34-22, and holding the Liberty to 31.4 percent shooting, a dismal percentage that was made worse by rushing open shots to cut a deficit that was 8 at halftime and as much as 18 points in the second half. The Liberty players had not shot that poorly since June 9, back when they were a different and far worse team.</p>
        <p>''They were extremely physical,'' Liberty Coach Richie Adubato said. ''They made us look like we were made out of papier-mache tonight. They were more aggressive than us, they knocked us around under the boards, they body-checked us so we couldn't run our offense -- our problem is, we didn't retaliate.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty scored the first basket of the game and after that, never had another lead. Their anemic offensive output was almost as dismal as their 57-41 loss to Miami on Aug. 6, also an ugly all-around effort.</p>
        <p>''We were running in mud earlier; I don't know why we were so slow to react,'' Adubato said. ''Early in the game, we didn't go after loose balls and attack the balls. A combination of our lack of aggressiveness and their overaggressiveness really prevented us from scoring. Fifty-six points is enough for you to win games, in most situations.''</p>
        <p>But not tonight.</p>
        <p>''That was a very playoff-type game,'' said the first-year Rockers Coach Dan Hughes, the author of the revival. ''I thought rebounding was a real key in winning the game. Our team played extremely hard tonight.''</p>
        <p>Cleveland, meanwhile, had three players score in double figures, led by forward Rushia Brown (18 points), Merlakia Jones (12) and Suzie McConnell Serio (10).</p>
        <p>''We didn't play with intensity,'' admitted forward Tari Phillips, who was double-teamed by Chasity Melvin and Brown, and whose 11 points made her the lone Liberty player to score in double figures.</p>
        <p>''They couldn't have played any better,'' Phillips said. ''They were in sync and we were in sync only some of the times.''</p>
        <p>The Liberty's Vickie Johnson, who made 11 of 20 field goals in the two first-round victories against the Washington Mystics, began the night shooting 0 for 8 and finished 1 of 14 for 2 points.</p>
        <p>The Liberty immediately looked uncomfortable, arguing calls, losing loose balls and throwing their heads back in disgust.</p>
        <p>After scoring the first basket of the game, the Liberty never led again. But the Rockers could not pull away until there were seven minutes remaining. The Liberty trailed, 16-13, and would never be that close again in the first half, as the Rockers launched a devastating 13-2 run that would be the difference in the game.</p>
