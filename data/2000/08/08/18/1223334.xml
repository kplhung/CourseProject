        <p>YOU could say that art critics are almost always, inescapably, writing about installation art, or at least the art of installation. This is because they are usually writing about exhibitions, that is, groupings of artworks whose physical arrangement, or installation, is basic to their impact.</p>
        <p>These arrangements require an unusual, probably unteachable talent for placing objects in space and in relation to one another, one reason a doctorate in art history does not necessarily a curator make. Poorly handled, installations can be an assault on art and viewer alike. At their best they can cast spells, convert the skeptic, provide transcendent moments of seeing, and make all kinds of points about art and its display.</p>

        <p>These arrangements require an unusual, probably unteachable talent for placing objects in space and in relation to one another, one reason a doctorate in art history does not necessarily a curator make. Poorly handled, installations can be an assault on art and viewer alike. At their best they can cast spells, convert the skeptic, provide transcendent moments of seeing, and make all kinds of points about art and its display.</p>
        <p>That is the case with ''Curios and Treasures,'' a modest yet serenely beautiful exhibition at the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Its 65 garments and accessories travel through four or five centuries of European dress, touching down lightly here and there.</p>
        <p>Some may find it a stretch to call this assortment an exhibition. Organized by Myra Walker, acting associate curator in charge of the institute, it is really little more than a potpourri of items whose primary common trait seems to be that they have almost never been exhibited since joining the institute's collection. But Ms. Walker has chosen her items well, juxtaposed them tellingly and given them plenty of space (which is slightly unusual for the Costume Institute). And she has had excellent backup from the museum's design department, especially where lighting is concerned.</p>
        <p>The results are close to magical: an elegant, meditative atmosphere in which the art of wearable clothes is unusually palpable. The overall effect is so different from Ms. Walker's previous effort, the raucous and overcrowded ''Rock Style,'' that it almost seems an act of penance. Compared to rock 'n' roll, this is the ''Moonlight'' Sonata. Which is not to condone the only misstep: the piping in of various bits of music, at rather high volume -- a waltz, something Baroque, something modern -- to clue visitors into the show's shifting focus. This is another example of the inexplicable practice, on the rise in museums, of asking people concentrating on still, silent objects to use their ears, too. If the art itself isn't deliberately making noise, nothing else should.</p>
        <p>It is always interesting to see what happens when the Costume Institute falls back on its own collection without benefit of outside loans or some big theme or epochal frame. This show includes garments plain and fancy, representing the efforts of people famous, forgotten or never known. There are 19th- and 20th-century evening dresses and tea gowns, including a suite of dresses by the great Mariano Fortuny; three rare men's doublets from the 17th century; and a group of men's and women's at-home wear from the 18th century. This last section is especially spare, with seven examples of the short, close-fitting jackets and bodices that women typically wore over loose dresses, seemingly suspended in midair.</p>
        <p>Nearby, a small vitrine contrasts accessories and social strata. On the one hand are richly embroidered gloves, slippers and silk purses, mostly from 16th- and 17th-century Spain and England, items clearly reserved for the palace-born. On the other are two simple knitted wool caps and four leather shoes, all English and dating from as early as the late 14th century. On the whole they resemble sows' ears, except a sharp-toed shoe called a poulaine. It's a little like a face-off between the royal portraiture of Velazquez and one of Breugel's roiling village scenes.</p>
        <p>But the true sovereign of this vitrine is an Austrian hat, an early-17th-century ancestor of the Tyrolean. Made of buff leather with a braid-trimmed rim, it has a full, slightly exaggerated crown that is divided into sections and accented with sharp, short diagonals, all embroidered in black. It suggests a hunter's hat fused with a hunter's well-stuffed game pie, and beyond that, it has the slightly clumsy volupte of a Marsden Hartley still life.</p>
        <p>Similarly buff leather, this time in the form of a sturdy man's doublet, presides over another vitrine. It contrasts strikingly with a far fancier version in polychrome silk brocade bordered with mauve silk braid, its front panels evoking the geometry of armor, its sleeves slashed for decorative effect.</p>
        <p>''Curios and Treasures'' presents several thin, wonderfully transparent slices of aesthetic and social history, like random frames excerpted from a film. These excerpts don't give us history, but they convey a vivid sense of how history happens, of the combination of invention, evolution and historical borrowing that constitutes the life of any art form.</p>
        <p>All these tendencies meet in Fortuny, represented by more than a dozen gowns and evening capes -- an unusual depth in the institute's holdings. Fortuny (1871-1949) was born in Spain, where he studied drawing and painting, and spent time in Germany, where he studied chemistry and dyes, and France before settling in Venice. His clothing design, like his set designs for theater and opera, drew on many cultural sources: Japanese kimonos; monks' habits; flowing, trumpet-sleeved Renaissance gowns; diaphanous Greek chemises.</p>
        <p>Fortuny was known for unusually rich, luminous colors, and he also figured out how to stencil velvet with gold patterns (variously Celtic, Islamic and Baroque in origin). Most important, he invented and patented a method for inflicting fine, permanent pleats on silk, so it was both form-fitting and expandable, like an early form of stretch fabric, yet had some body of its own.</p>
        <p>In a way Fortuny is the touchstone for the show. Nearby are the luurious velvet gowns by two little-known designers whom he influenced: Maria Monaci Gallenga (Italian, 1880-1944) and Mme. Babani, a French designer who opened a boutique in Paris in 1919.</p>
        <p>At another point the modernity and functionality of Fortuny's pleating contrast with a less progressive evocation of things Greek: a yellow silk evening gown from the 1880's, attributed to Liberty &amp; Company, whose cascade of horizontally draped fabric is actually carefully tacked down. It was inspired by Oscar Wilde's pronouncements that women should dress according to ''Grecian form,'' and its traditionalism is hinted at by a tiny row of box pleats at the hem; although these also suggest the toothlike details (called dentils) on the entablature of a Greek temple.</p>
        <p>Such mixed messages are not surprising, given the complicated ways that function, fantasy, art and desire can intersect in clothes. Even more deeply divided is a French evening dress in blue silk with a high bustle, a lace overdress and a skirt whose horizontal draping is similar to the Wilde concoction. As if that weren't enough, the skirt is completed by a deep border of box pleats and gathered bands that resemble an inverted dust ruffle.</p>
        <p>A more harmonious alliance of old and new is to be found in an ivory silk shantung dress, also French, from 1908. It updates a relatively conventional hourglass silhouette with curling tendrils of self-piping, whose bold spirals and undulations may have been inspired by Art Nouveau but also presage Alexander Calder's hammered silver-wire jewelry in the 1930's.</p>
        <p>Another showstopper is a formidable worker's smock in buff-colored linen from 19th-century rural England. In all likelihood the handiwork of some farmer's wife, intended for Sunday best, it has a broad densely embroidered collar and a square panel of smocking that forms a kind of grillwork across the chest and also appears in broad bands at the wrists.</p>
        <p>Nearby two girls' dresses and several women's gowns show how smocking made its way into more genteel society, a process initiated by Liberty in the 1880's. Smocking might be described as embroidery that works for a living, in that each stitch is pulled, rather than left flat, so the fabric is bunched into regular gathers.</p>
        <p>The stitching, which is carefully plotted on a grid, has all kinds of architectural and geometric associations. In front of the man's smock, I found myself thinking of Sol LeWitt, the cables on the Brooklyn Bridge and chain mail. But its beauty is also fashion-specific; it reiterates the transformation from two to three dimensions that a plane of fabric must undergo to become a finished garment.</p>
        <p>This show's best objects, which are many, inspire this kind of musing. Seeing, after all, is not simply believing: it is the equaled pleasure of looking and having thoughts of one's own. A good installation helps.</p>
        <p>''Curios and Treasures'' is at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500, through Jan. 21.</p>
