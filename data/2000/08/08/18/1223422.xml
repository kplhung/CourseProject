        <p>Russians Say Collision May Have Sunk Submarine  Russian officials said that growing evidence of catastrophic damage to their sunken nuclear submarine's hull pointed to a collision with an object or ship. United States officials, who have said no American submarines in the area were involved, have reported that underwater explosions were detected, sounds distinct from those of a collision. Russian rescue teams made more attempts to lock onto a rear escape hatch of the submarine, the Kursk.</p>

        <p>The mourning has already begun in the northern Russian port city of Murmansk, which lives off the Russian Navy, as few hold out hope for the lives of the sub's 118 men.</p>

        <p>Gore Defines Himself And Outlines His Goals  Vice President Al Gore made his debut as the Democratic presidential nominee with a vow to work for all Americans, ''especially those who need a voice, those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up so they are never left behind.''</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's delivery was uncharacteristically brisk as he reeled off causes and issues dear to core Democratic constituencies -- health care, civil rights, affirmative action, public education and abortion rights.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was headed back to the fund-raising circuit after his speech to the convention, as host of a concert to raise $5.2 million for his party.</p>
        <p>A19</p>
        <p>Many union officials and union members at the convention remain deeply upset over the China trade deal. Party leaders spent much of the week trying to soothe their feelings.</p>

        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's speech on Wednesday drew a larger television audience than did Dick Cheney's in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>A19</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman refers to himself as an ''observant Jew,'' not Orthodox, a distinction he makes, an aide said, ''because he doesn't follow the strict Orthodox code and doesn't want to offend the Orthodox.''</p>
        <p>A19</p>
        <p>Bush Agrees to 3 Debates  Advisers to Gov. George W. Bush said he would participate in three presidential debates, an announcement intended to blunt criticism from the Gore campaign that Mr. Bush was trying to avoid such face-to-face contests.</p>

        <p>New Grand Jury for Clinton  Robert W. Ray, the independent counsel investigating President Clinton's relationship with a White House intern, has empaneled a grand jury to hear evidence, government officials said. The action is part of Mr. Ray's announced intention to consider whether Mr. Clinton should be charged with criminal wrongdoing after he leaves office.</p>
        <p>A22</p>
        <p>Government Misled Court  An F.B.I. agent admitted in federal court that he provided misleading testimony last December that made Wen Ho Lee, left, a Los Alamos scientist accused of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets, appear deceptive when he had not been.</p>

        <p>Trial Ordered in '75 Killing  A juvenile court judge in Connecticut ruled that Michael Skakel, 39, should be tried in the 1975 slaying of Martha Moxley. The judge must next decide whether Mr. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy's, should be tried as an adult. Conviction as an adult could bring a life sentence; conviction as a juvenile would carry a maximum sentence of four years.</p>

        <p>Hearing on Pesticide  An E.P.A. toxicologist, Dr. Brian Dementi, who criticized a preliminary agency report this year that said malathion showed little evidence of being harmful to humans, made his case to an independent panel of scientists assembled by the E.P.A. partly in response to his concerns.</p>

        <p>A Charter School's Decline  New Covenant, lavished with praise by Governor Pataki when it opened in Albany last September, is being threatened with loss of its charter by state regulators concerned by its students' poor performance and by upheaval in its management.</p>

        <p>Deal on Database Is Set Aside  A federal bankruptcy judge set aside an F.T.C. plan to limit the ability of an online retailer, Toysmart.com, to sell its customer database as part of its liquidation, even though the data was collected with the promise of confidentiality. The judge said that absent an actual buyer of the data, the F.T.C. action was premature.</p>
