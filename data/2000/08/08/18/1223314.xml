        <p>It's difficult to think of any city, other than the urban behemoths like New York and Los Angeles, and maybe Washington, that has shaped modern living in the United States as much as this one.</p>
        <p>Nordstrom, Boeing, Microsoft, Starbucks, Amazon: all innovators, all based here in the Pacific Northwest, off in a remote corner of the nation, far from the main centers of population. Yet they play a central part in daily life across this continent and beyond.</p>
        <p>Seattle's man of the millennium, of course, is William H. Gates, who created the corporate principality named Microsoft, making powerful enemies in Washington, D.C., along the way. His company, housed in 40-odd X-shaped buildings on a 30-acre campus in suburban Redmond, was for a time the most valuable in America, and Mr. Gates still commands one of the greatest fortunes in history.</p>
        <p>The nerd-in-chief and his wife, Melinda, live in a $100 million giga-mansion with a rather wistful quotation from ''The Great Gatsby'' inscribed on the ceiling of the library: ''He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.''</p>
        <p>Seattle still has its funky side. It revels in its mellow small-town atmosphere; a Seattle ad man popularized the ''happy face.'' But it has become an unmistakably rich, high-tech, high-rise, high-expectation metropolis.</p>
        <p>Ask Paul Schell, the mayor, what he's up to, and he will tell you:</p>
        <p>''We're trying to manage the transition from regional center to major international city without losing the core values of the place in the process. We're eight and one-half hours from Tokyo and eight and one-half hours from London; a basically conservative city; a collection of small communities, now overlaid with 110 languages and living at the epicenter of technological change. It's not an easy job.''</p>
        <p>Seattle makes room for creators. It takes pride in its part in the careers of Quincy Jones, Ray Charles, Kurt Cobain and Jimi Hendrix and waxes nostalgic about Pearl Jam. August Wilson, the playwright, lives close by at Enumclaw. Raymond Carver, the writer, lived out the last years of his short, hard life at Port Angeles on the Olympic Peninsula, just across Puget Sound, crafting terse, claustrophobic short stories at the edge of the forest primeval.</p>
        <p>Gary Larson draws here, and the mystic Mark Tobey painted here. So did the Harlem Renaissance master Jacob Lawrence, who died this summer. Dale Chihuly, the flamboyant one-eyed glass sculptor, produces his extravagantly vivid showpieces, which have been displayed everywhere from Las Vegas to Venice to Jerusalem, in a workshop on Lake Union where George Y. Pocock once built the world's finest racing shells.</p>
        <p>Seattle always reminds me and my wife, Betsey, of San Francisco. It belongs to the sea; around every corner there is a view of the water. Its streets and its skyscrapers cling to hillsides. It has more than a whiff of the Orient about it, and it is obsessed by food, wine and restaurants. I know a Seattle native living in exile in Washington, D.C., who has a whole Pacific salmon air-freighted to him when he and his wife give a dinner party.</p>
        <p>But Seattle is different. It is less full of itself than its rival down the coast. Less cynical, too. Young families and the middle class here have resisted the stampede to the suburbs. People worry that they'll be spoiled by success, yes. They worry that they will have to wear neckties. But on balance they are optimistic, even about the weather, smiling through the mist; it is all that water, after all, that turns buddleias from butterfly bushes into 20-foot butterfly trees and brings out the flashing crimsons of the fuchsias.</p>
        <p>As things stand now, a culture of self-effacement prevails in the city. There are techno-millionaires here, geeks worth 20 times as much as New Yorkers with chauffeurs, who wear sandals and ride the bus to work. Everyone is cheerful, pleasant, upbeat, from the bank presidents to the bellhops. And everyone is pathologically polite; people would rather die than honk, no matter how maniacal the traffic.</p>
        <p>''It gets on your nerves,'' said Michael Kinsley, himself a manifestly mannerly gent, who came west four years back to edit Microsoft's online magazine, Slate. ''You keep wondering if you can live up to it.''</p>
        <p>Wild and Urban</p>
        <p>Seattle took a hundred years and more to fully hit its stride, but almost from the start it has been an unusual blend of wild and urban.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1851 on a series of waterside hills then clad with magnificent Douglas firs, it always had those noble vistas of the Cascades and the Olympic Mountains, when weather permitted (as it often didn't and doesn't, especially before the fog lifts at noon). It always had Lake Washington and Lake Union, Elliott Bay and Puget Sound, inhabited by salmon and giant octopuses with arms 15 feet long, crossed these days by floating bridges, steel-arch spans and ferries. By 1900 timber and trade with Asia as well as the financial backwash from the Klondike gold rush of 1897-98 had put big bucks in local pockets.</p>
        <p>Still, visitors from more cosmopolitan cities weren't much impressed. Several decades ago Sir Thomas Beecham, the conductor, who waggled his baton for a few seasons in these parts, called Seattle ''an aesthetic dustbin.'' His countryman Alistair Cooke called it ''a rain-soaked fishing village halfway between San Francisco and Alaska.'' But that was before the World's Fair of 1962, with its monorail and its Space Needle (recently given a $20 million face-lift), and the 35-year population explosion that followed it.</p>
        <p>Pike Place Market, the zesty souk on the waterfront -- my colleague Timothy Egan once described it as ''the Marrakesh of the Northwest'' -- was saved from the wrecker's ball during the Vietnam era. It has lived on as the heart and soul of the city, notable alike for the goofy exuberance of its merchants and the quality of its fare: Dungeness crab and Olympia oysters, pale pink stargazer lilies and beaming yellow sunflowers, Rainier cherries and Walla Walla onions. It is the outstanding public market in the United States.</p>
        <p>As the country rediscovered the outdoors, it discovered Seattle, a city whose residents can sail among the orca whales in the San Juan Islands, with bald eagles cruising overhead, and climb snow-capped Mount Rainier in the same week. With its mild if legendarily rainy climate, the place was made, positively made, for skiing, cycling, running, rowing, sailing, hydroplane racing and a dozen other sports.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, the Eddie Bauer store here, originally an outfitter for mountaineers, grew into a national sporting-goods powerhouse. Seattle's Recreational Equipment flagship superstore, a co-op to which almost one of three people in the region belong, has a 65-foot indoor artificial pinnacle where young studs practice rock climbing.</p>
        <p>A Building Boom</p>
        <p>By 1975 Seattle was in fashion. The Seattle Opera produced Richard Wagner's ''Ring'' that summer -- the first time the cycle had ever been produced within a week's time, as originally prescribed by the Wagner family, anywhere in the United States aside from the Metropolitan. New York took notice, as did London and Bayreuth.</p>
        <p>Over the next 15 years, a half-dozen books and magazines, including Harper's and Money, rated Seattle as the nation's most livable city. It got a snazzy new art museum, cunningly slotted into the urban streetscape downtown by Robert Venturi in 1991, and a heralded new home for the Seattle Symphony, Benaroya Hall, opened in 1998.</p>
        <p>A new park for the Seattle Mariners, Safeco Field, was unveiled last year to replace the unloved Kingdome, demolished in a mere 16.8 seconds on March 26, 1999, known locally as ''Dome's Day.'' The new ballpark, with a retractable roof, cost $517 million, financed mostly by local taxes, making it the most costly sports center in the country. The edge was taken off the celebration when the team announced that it was trading its star, Ken Griffey Jr., arguably the best all-rounder in baseball, to Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>A $250 million rock 'n' roll museum, known as the Experience Music Project, opened just this summer. Designed by Frank O. Gehry, it houses 80,000 artifacts inside an aggressively billowing aluminum and stainless-steel shell decked out in gold, silver, red, powder blue and iridescent purple. The initial reviews have been decidedly mixed. The tickets cost too much ($19.95 each), the complicated electronic gadgets meant to guide the visitor around too often don't work and as Susan Nielsen, a Seattle Times columnist, wrote recently, ''The whole inside of the building is like a guy trying so hard to be hip that the muscles stand out on his neck.''</p>
        <p>Yet the building boom rolls on, powered by the city's cyber-riche. A new public library is planned, designed by no less than Rem Koolhaas, the celebrated Dutch master; and Terry Farrell, the British postmodernist, is working on a new aquarium. The Opera House is soon to be rebuilt, in part with money from the McCaw family, pioneers of the mobile telephone. Also on the way are an elaborate new civic center and a grand new football stadium, financed, like the rock museum, by Paul G. Allen, Mr. Gates's partner in founding Microsoft.</p>
        <p>Old Guard Feels Ruffled</p>
        <p>All this activity unsettles the old guard, which is attached to the city's comfy old Beaux-Arts look, typified by the terra-cotta walrus heads that decorate the Arctic Building on Third Avenue. A sleek new hotel, W, prompted the locals to ask, ''It's nice, but is it really Seattle?'' People have the same doubts about the Venturi and Gehry buildings. Phyllis Hayes, whose family has deep local roots, summed up the attitude this way: ''Wonderful things are happening, but they're happening too fast, and they cost so much.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Schell says it builds character. ''I want people's teeth to chatter,'' he told me over a Scotch and water. ''Change has no constituency, or not a big one, but here of all places it would be crazy to resist.''</p>
        <p>Some of the things that are happening are not at all wonderful.</p>
        <p>Employment is down at Boeing, the nation's largest manufacturer and largest exporter. The e-business slump has the people over at HomeGrocer.com and Drugstore.com worried, and Microsoft stock, the foundation of thousands of local fortunes, has taken a dive in response to the Clinton administration's successful antitrust suit. With the population of the metropolitan area approaching 2.5 million, growth has slowed, at least for the moment.</p>
        <p>But angst is not at all Seattle's style. The city is still thinking big; the least appealing suite in a new apartment complex in Kirkland, not far from the Microsoft campus, is currently on the market for $2.9 million.</p>
        <p>Seattle earned a reputation early on for radicalism. Anna Louise Strong, a charismatic Marxist, sat on the school board, and the Industrial Workers of the World, a pioneering hard-left union known as the Wobblies, flourished here. The city was idled in 1919 by the nation's only general strike. Communists led a maritime strike in 1934.</p>
        <p>That feisty spirit may be bubbling back to the surface as the gap between have and have-not widens again. At least that is one widespread interpretation of the protests last December at the World Trade Organization's conference here.</p>
        <p>Yin and Yang</p>
        <p>But at the same time, Seattle has always been marked by a certain emotional reticence, perhaps a legacy from its early Scandinavian settlers. Walt Crowley, a historian who runs a crackerjack local Web site (historylink.org), talks of this as ''a city with a split personality, a yin side and a yang side.'' Two of its most noted politicians, both Democrats, both senators, exemplified the split. Henry M. Jackson, ''the senator from Boeing,'' concentrated on national security issues; personally, he was understated, a paragon of probity. Warren G. Magnuson, a prime mover on civil rights, environmental law and consumer protection, was much more rambunctious, a man who liked a drink or two.</p>
        <p>The dark, rainy days of winter may have something to do with Seattle's love of books. The city is notable for its bookstores, from the encyclopedic Elliott Bay Book Company to specialists like the Peter Miller shop, which sells architecture books. The climate has also contributed to the city's movie mania, satisfied at theaters like the Harvard Exit and the Egyptian.</p>
        <p>I would wager that the same thing is true of Seattle's passion for coffee, which added words like latte and dopio to the American language through the unstoppable growth of Starbucks. The name, by the way, comes from that of the java-loving mate in ''Moby-Dick.''</p>
        <p>Seattle must have a thousand cafes of one kind or another -- places to grab a quick cuppa, places like Le Pichet that serve simple meals, breakfast cafes like Bacco that serve nine-grain toast and juice bombs (an orange, pear and pineapple blend, for example, called Pegasus). It has a pair of Thriftway supermarkets that stage an annual Peach-O-Rama, featuring pallet-loads of perfect fruit that has reached a prescribed, scientifically measured level of sweetness. It has shops specializing in espresso-machine repair.</p>
        <p>There are problems in this food paradise. Jon Rowley, who introduced the ambrosial Copper River salmon from Alaska to the lower 48, said that the black cod, which he calls ''one of the real aristocrats of the ocean,'' has all but disappeared from local waters. You can still see the elegant, silvery salmon swimming up the fish ladder at Ballard Locks, bound with fixated stares in their eyes for the fresh water where they spawn and die, but the seasonal runs are smaller.</p>
        <p>Still, the berries from the San Juan Islands remain the sweetest I know. Sol Amon of the Pure Food Fish Market can still explain the availability of razor clams, which depends on the tidal cycle. Sur la Table has enough pots and pans and gadgets to cook a state dinner. Jerry Traunfeld of the Herbfarm restaurant may know more about cooking with herbs than anyone anywhere. And where else would you find a hidden private dining room for four like the one at Canlis, a treehouse for pampered grown-ups, just next to a towering hillside pine?</p>
        <p>Fare for Inner Lives</p>
        <p>Seattle offers ample nourishment for the soul as well as the body.</p>
        <p>The Seattle Art Museum, whose dramatic main staircase is a late-20th-century version of the Louvre's, houses a few choice old masters, including a Paolo Uccello illustrating episodes from the ''Aeneid,'' and rich holdings of African tribal art and Northwest Coast Native American art. It has a fine Asian collection, housed in a classic Art Deco building in Volunteer Park.</p>
        <p>One day it will have much more. More than $250 million was reportedly spent on art by area collectors last year, and the museum hopes to be given part of the splendid Barney A. Ebsworth collection of modern American art that it has been showing lately. That collection includes Edward Hopper's melancholy masterpiece ''Chop Suey'' (hung here near David Hockney's chillingly formal double portrait of Henry Geldzahler and Christopher Scott). Mr. Ebsworth is from St. Louis, his wife from Seattle.</p>
        <p>The Seattle Symphony is shooting for the top echelon in its new hall, which is adorned with a pair of arresting white clusters by Mr. Chihuly and other works by Mark di Suvero and Robert Rauschenberg. Under the accomplished and intense Gerard Schwarz, its music director since 1985 (and the music director of New York's annual Mostly Mozart Festival since 1982), it gave a performance last year of Deems Taylor's neglected opera ''Peter Ibbetson.'' This year it will play with such guest conductors as Claus Peter Flor and Richard Hickox and such soloists as Radu Lupu, Maxim Vengerov and Renee Fleming.</p>
        <p>Though somewhat less well known, the Pacific Northwest Ballet, led by Francia Russell and Kent Stowell, former dancers with the New York City Ballet, has won acclaim in recent years for its staging of works by George Balanchine.</p>
        <p>Seattle is awash in theater of every description. The Intiman Theater staged ''The Kentucky Cycle'' by Robert Schenkkan in 1991; the play won a Pulitzer Prize in 1992, before it opened in New York. The Seattle Repertory Theater has a long-standing relationship with Wendy Wasserstein dating from the days when it was run by the director Dan Sullivan. And ACT -- the letters stand for A Contemporary Theater -- is soon to present a new Philip Glass opera, ''In the Penal Colony,'' based on a Kafka story, with sets by John Conklin.</p>
        <p>Each of the three has a budget exceeding $3 million a year, and each has more than 10,000 subscribers -- remarkable numbers for a city this size.</p>
        <p>Wagner, Environmentally</p>
        <p>But opera is easily the city's cultural long suit, thanks to Glynn Ross, who brought Wagner to the region, and Speight Jenkins, his successor at the Seattle Opera.</p>
        <p>A lean, fervent man, once a New York reporter and critic, Mr. Jenkins has been at the helm here for 17 years. Next year, three ''Ring'' cycles will be presented in a new production directed by Stephen Wadsworth, with more than a little kibbitzing from Mr. Jenkins. Jane Eaglen, now established as the premier Wagnerian soprano of her day, will sing Brunnhilde; she has been a Seattle darling since making her American debut here in ''Norma'' in 1994. In 1998 she teamed with Ben Heppner in a rapturously received ''Tristan und Isolde.''</p>
        <p>The new $10 million ''Ring'' sold out more than a year in advance to Wagnerians all over the world. Why Seattle? Earlier Jenkins efforts were sometimes booed, even pelted with fruit, but they came to be seen as classics. He pushed the company deep into the red but lifted it back out again. ''We became the thing in town,'' he said, ''and then people from elsewhere came here out of curiosity.''</p>
        <p>This time, he promised a ''green 'Ring,' '' and the ''Rheingold,'' which made its bow this season, emphasized Wagner's preoccupation with the natural world of forests, mountains and rivers, inhabited by mythic gods and goddesses -- not inappropriate, given the passionate environmentalism of the Puget Sound audience. It was all totally unlike Bayreuth's new production, where Valhalla is depicted as a high rise under construction.</p>
        <p>''We will use technology to maximum effect,'' Mr. Jenkins vowed, ''but this will be a traditional 'Ring,' and it will above all be an acted 'Ring' -- a theater piece. Everyone will act. No more of this standing around singing.''</p>
