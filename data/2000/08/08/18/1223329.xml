        <p>There's no need to get in a snit about remaking a movie, however great. Every half-century or so, even a classic can use some dusting off. But ''High Noon''? Even people who have never seen the film probably have an image of Gary Cooper as the heroic marshal striding down Main Street, alone, to face a killer. Few movies have been so inseparable from the star, or so deeply embedded in the popular imagination. (Harry Thomason, who produced Bill Clinton's lone walk along a long corridor before his entrance at the Democratic convention this week, said he was inspired by that scene; unlike Mr. Clinton, Cooper was not shot from such a low angle that his body looked as elongated as a space invader's.)</p>
        <p>The new TBS version is a faithful, pallid, thoroughly wrongheaded echo of the 1952 original. The laughable idea of the Tom Skerritt ''High Noon'' merely hints at the many problems with this movie, which doesn't begin to do what good remakes can: reinvent a film for a new generation.</p>

        <p>There's no need to get in a snit about remaking a movie, however great. Every half-century or so, even a classic can use some dusting off. But ''High Noon''? Even people who have never seen the film probably have an image of Gary Cooper as the heroic marshal striding down Main Street, alone, to face a killer. Few movies have been so inseparable from the star, or so deeply embedded in the popular imagination. (Harry Thomason, who produced Bill Clinton's lone walk along a long corridor before his entrance at the Democratic convention this week, said he was inspired by that scene; unlike Mr. Clinton, Cooper was not shot from such a low angle that his body looked as elongated as a space invader's.)</p>
        <p>The new TBS version is a faithful, pallid, thoroughly wrongheaded echo of the 1952 original. The laughable idea of the Tom Skerritt ''High Noon'' merely hints at the many problems with this movie, which doesn't begin to do what good remakes can: reinvent a film for a new generation.</p>
        <p>What is ''High Noon'' divorced from Cooper's haunting presence?  Even without him, there could have been new life in the story of Will Kane, the marshall who cleaned up Hadleyville. On the day he marries, Kane is about to leave town with his Quaker bride when he learns that Frank Miller, a killer he sent to prison, is arriving on the noon train and gunning for him.</p>
        <p>The tale is fraught with moral issues. Should Kane stay and defend himself, or listen to his pacifist wife and flee? That question should carry even more resonance today, when the legacy of the Vietnam War makes the wife's arguments more familiar than they might have been in the 50's.</p>
        <p>And it is loaded with mythic Western figures in addition to the noble marshal. There are the archetypal light and dark women: Amy Kane, the virginal bride (Grace Kelly in the original), and Helen Ramirez, the sensual Mexican who used to be the lover of both Kane and Miller.</p>
        <p>Though the script makes few changes in Carl Foreman's original screenplay, here the archetypes become caricatures. Every choice backfires. The film maintains the idea of unfolding in real time, running an hour and a quarter from the minute Kane hears that Miller is coming until the train arrives. That stunt demands the tautness that Fred Zinnemann brought to the original, but here Rod Hardy's direction and pacing are slack. And how absurd is it to shoot a film in real time, then break it up with commercials?</p>
        <p>The acting is timid. As Amy, who threatens to leave if her husband stays to fight, Susanna Thompson is washed out and whiny. (Grace Kelly's bride, shining with vitality, was no wimp.) Maria Conchita Alonso seems equally worn down as Helen, who is supposed to be fiercely in love with Kane.</p>
        <p>Mr. Skerritt doesn't even get points for having the gall to take on the Cooper role because he does nothing to try to make it his own. He mumbles through most of the movie. At one point he squints as a reaction to bad news. As he lumbers from the church to the saloon trying to deputize the townsmen, he looks pathetic rather than brave. He might as well be an amateur impressionist doing Gary Cooper.</p>
        <p>Reed Diamond (Mike Kellerman on ''Homicide'') plays the callow, selfish deputy, Harvey Pell, and Michael Madsen is the villainous Miller. Mr. Diamond looks conspicuously thin, while Mr. Madsen makes you wonder how Miller ate so well in prison. The fact that such details leap out is a sign of how uninvolving the movie is.</p>
        <p>And despite its slavish fidelity, this new version does not include one original element that might have helped: the theme song. (The producers were not able to get the rights.) ''Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling,'' runs through the original so effectively it has become a Western anthem.</p>
        <p>Any remake deserves to be taken on its own terms, but the best that can be said about the new ''High Noon'' is: rent the old one (or watch it on Turner Classic Movies on Sunday at 2 p.m.). It holds up remarkably well and explains why Gary Cooper helped define the Hollywood Western at its height.</p>
        <p>HIGH NOON  TBS, Sunday at 8 p.m.</p>
