        <p>A team from the South Bronx that was bidding to earn a trip to Williamsport, Pa., and trying to become the first Little League World Series champion from New York City in 36 years made one small misstep in the Eastern Regional final tonight at the A. Bartlett Giamatti training center.</p>
        <p>As a result, a team from Goffstown, N.H., will make the trip instead, after it got a run in the seventh inning and won, 1-0, behind the two-hit pitching of Bud Collins, who scored the run.</p>
        <p>Juan Almonte of the Rolando Paulino Little League team, which represented New York State, matched Collins in a wondrous pitching duel through the regulation six innings. Each right-hander wound up yielding two walks and two hits, with Almonte striking out 12 batters and Collins 11.</p>
        <p>But the game tipped New Hampshire's way in the seventh inning on a walk to Collins, a sliced single to right by Jarek Ostrowski and an errant throw from right field.</p>
        <p>The New Hampshire third-base coach, Scott Desjarlais, conceded that he took a big chance waving Collins home from first on Ostrowski's single.</p>
        <p>''The way their pitcher was throwing, I felt we had to take the opportunity,'' Desjarlais said. ''When I saw the throw come in toward third, I decided to send Ben home.''</p>
        <p>The shutout by Collins gave the team from a suburb of Manchester, N.H., the green light to Williamsport, where the eight-team World Series tournament begins a weeklong run on Sunday.</p>
        <p>It also ended a superb run for the team from the Bronx. Only three teams from New York City have reached the Little League World Series, and all three were from Staten Island. Mid Island won the championship in 1964. Teams from South Shore qualified in 1985 and 1991.</p>
        <p>About 150 family members and friends of the Bronx players, almost all of them wearing the team's cardinal red colors and some of them with their faces painted red, sat behind the team's dugout tonight.</p>
        <p>''We love these kids,'' said Rolando Torres, whose son Victor is on the team. ''Most of us have been here for every game.''</p>
        <p>All were there until the end tonight as the Bronx team threatened in the bottom of the seventh. With one out and the potential tying run on second base and the winning run on first, O'Brien Rivera hit the ball back to the mound and Collins threw to third for a forceout, then struck out the next batter to end the game and the dreams of the New York champions.</p>
        <p>''The kids are happy we got this far, Coach Alberto Gonzalez said. ''But we are not giving up until we get to the big dance.''</p>
        <p>When asked why he was smiling, the coach responded, ''I'm smiling, but I feel a lot of pain inside.''</p>
        <p>The coach has seen the caliber of play in the seven-year-old Rolando Paulino Little League improve. Last year's squad, which included five members of this year's team, got as far as the regional quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>This year, in repeating as the New York State champion, the Bronx team won 10 consecutive games to qualify for the Eastern regional. It defeated four teams from its district in New York City, three teams in the sectional tournament, including South Shore, and three more teams in the state tournament, including Colonie in the final.</p>
        <p>What made the overall performance of the Bronx team even more remarkable was that it has no home field; players used diamonds in both the South and East Bronx, especially at Claremont and Crotona Parks, and a field at the intersection of LaFontaine Avenue and 181st Street.</p>
        <p>''It would be nice to have a home field, and I hope we do by next season, but we don't,'' Coach Gonzalez said. ''But we make the best of it.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The championship game between the winners of the New England and Middle Atlantic brackets was a finale in more ways than one. Starting next year, when the Little League World Series expands to 16 teams from eight teams, the winners of both the New England and Middle Atlantic brackets will qualify for Williamsport. The same will be true in the other seven regional tournaments, where two teams, and not one, will qualify.</p>
