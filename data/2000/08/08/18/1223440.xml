        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Legal Firms Cutting Back on Free Services for Poor'' (front page, Aug. 17) did not mention some ways in which law firms have become more effective in providing pro bono services. Increasingly, firms are joining with corporate clients to provide legal support for their civic contributions, particularly economic development in distressed communities. A second device is ''externships'' that allow lawyers to spend up to several months working for public-interest legal service organizations.</p>
        <p>As American law firms have increased global operations, they have emphasized pro bono work in many countries that had no such tradition.</p>

        <p>As American law firms have increased global operations, they have emphasized pro bono work in many countries that had no such tradition.</p>
        <p>At my firm, we make it clear that pro bono time counts when determining end-of-year bonuses, thus eliminating any perceived disincentive. The raw number of hours logged, though significant, does not fully capture the ways in which the profession is fulfilling its commitment.</p>

        <p>The writer is chairman of the pro-bono committee at White &amp; Case.</p>
