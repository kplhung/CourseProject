        <p>BAUM-Birgitta Greiffe. Died suddenly after a short illness on August 16, 2000. Her memory will live forever in the hearts and minds of those she reached out to and loved. Her devoted husband, Robert cherishes each moment of their 44 years of marriage and their devoted son, Eric, who loves her so much, will carry forward the values and love that she deeply instilled in him and made the essence of our family life. Goodbye Mutti-Goodbye B.T. Donations may be made to The American Cancer Society.</p>
