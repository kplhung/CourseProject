        <p>In this northern port city that lives off the Russian Navy, the mourning has already begun. Few now hold out any hope for the lives of the 118 men aboard the submarine Kursk, which has been trapped under the Barents Sea for six days.</p>

        <p>In this northern port city that lives off the Russian Navy, the mourning has already begun. Few now hold out any hope for the lives of the 118 men aboard the submarine Kursk, which has been trapped under the Barents Sea for six days.</p>
        <p>With summer drawing to a close here and the air already chilly, stems of fireweed, a purple flower, brushed gently today against the cement walls of Repair Factory No. 35, which fixes submarines. Inside, Vitaly Ryabov, a sailor on a nuclear-powered submarine, stopped to compare the tragedy with a brief emergency on board his vessel years ago.</p>
        <p>''They are in a hell that you can't imagine,'' said Mr. Ryabov, 29, who is still committed to his career, which was also his father's. ''It's freezing cold down there. You know there's help right above you, but you are waiting for death. If anyone is left alive, it's only the strongest.''</p>
        <p>Nearly everyone here has been touched by the catastrophe, in which the Kursk sank to the bottom of the sea on Saturday. Just under a million people live in the region, which is still dominated by the navy bases and closed cities erected by the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Before long, they were to be joined by more anxious relatives, as train No. 140, full of bronzed Russian vacationers returning from southern resorts, took on a much grimmer load today. Boarding the Simferopol-Murmansk train in Kursk today were the families of seven sailors of the city's namesake nuclear submarine.</p>
        <p>One relative, Ruslan Kuznetsov, with dark circles under his eyes, clutched a Russian tabloid featuring a big portrait of his older brother, 28-year-old Viktor, and an article about how their mother, just out of a hospital after major surgery, was waiting in Kursk for news of her son.</p>
        <p>But today, mothers and brothers were not the only ones waiting with anguish. Government officials in Murmansk spoke in quiet tones as they offered little reassurance. The region's governor, looking drawn, seemed almost to speak of the crew in the past tense. In an interview to the local Murmansk television station, he wondered aloud about the failed rescue attempts.</p>
        <p>''This is a tragedy, a serious tragedy,'' Gov. Yuri Yevdokimov said. ''The reasons are not known, despite all the investigations that are still under way. We don't know what has happened inside the boat.''</p>
        <p>Other officials looked somber at a news conference, which was hastily called after a six-hour meeting at the headquarters of the Northern Fleet, situated in the neighboring town of Severomorsk. That city and the small town of Vedyaevo, where most of the crew members' families live, are both secret military sites and are closed to most journalists.</p>
        <p>From shopkeepers to factory workers, virtually everyone stayed in front of their televisions and radios. Three women, employees at the Northern Fleet Museum, did not even turn away from an afternoon television news broadcast to direct visitors to the museum's entrance. One snapped off the sound when the broadcast finished. ''They've watched every one of today's broadcasts,'' one woman said, shaking her head.</p>
        <p>Most condemned Russian officials for not taking action sooner and for waiting to accept help from abroad.</p>
        <p>''They hid it from us for two days,'' said Vyacheslav Kuzmich, a 53-year-old former major in the antiaircraft forces in the region. ''The most disgusting part is that aid was offered and they rejected it. Now they're powdering our noses and telling us stories. These are state criminals. I would hang them all.''</p>
        <p>On the train headed to Murmansk, relatives faced a 45-hour journey into the unknown on a train that is usually used to deliver them to happy reunions with their seafaring sons.</p>
        <p>Most spoke quietly among themselves or stared silently out the window. Piles of fruit and candy plied on them by the anxious relatives who saw them off lay untouched on their tables.</p>
        <p>While some of the mothers were able to recount sweet memories of their sons, the fathers were visibly tormented and aggressively silent. Vladimir Shalopinin, himself a veteran of the fleet, buried his face in his hands and cursed the navy he once served and to which his son, 19-year-old Lyosha, so aspired.</p>
        <p>''Yes, I was so careless as to serve in the fleet,'' he said. ''I don't want to talk. Talk to the mothers.''</p>
        <p>Nadezhda Shalopinin apologized for her husband. ''He is not so frightening,'' she said. ''He is just suffering so much over Lyosha.''</p>
        <p>Several bunks down, Valentina Budykina, head of a committee of mothers of Kursk sailors, described the weird twists and turns in the minds of parents frantically searching for reassurance that their sons will survive the dangers of military service. Her biggest effort until this week was helping mothers whose sons are serving in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>''I had a mother who said, 'I'm so happy my son is in Chechnya and not in the fleet. At least in Chechnya he's on the ground.' ''</p>
        <p>As word spread throughout the train that these families were aboard, other passengers expressed their frustrations over the plight of the men trapped on the Kursk. Aleksandr Ivanov, a fisherman on his way back home to Murmansk, said he had no faith in the military.</p>
        <p>''I was in the fleet for three years and feel like I crossed three years out of my life,'' he said. ''They don't care about people at all.</p>
        <p>''Sailors are cannon fodder to them,'' he continued. ''I think half of them may be dead.'' He also condemned President Vladimir V. Putin for not cutting short his vacation to deal with the disaster.</p>
        <p>The train's restaurant car was far enough from the families that at least a few passengers who were eating perhaps did not know that there was such suffering in their midst. But if they had looked, reminders were everywhere. The radio was tuned to a station alternating pop music with news reports on the Kursk and commentary on the consequences.</p>
        <p>''We wouldn't accept help from the British,'' said a political commentator on the radio as diners downed their beers. ''Putin is in Sochi on vacation. Putin isn't leaving Sochi. The sailors on the Kursk are prisoners of his pride.''</p>
