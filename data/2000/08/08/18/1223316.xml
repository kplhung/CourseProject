        <p>THE PRINCE OF TENNESSEE  The Rise of Al Gore  By David Maraniss  and Ellen Nakashima  323 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $23.</p>
        <p>Scattered throughout David Maraniss and Ellen Nakashima's flimsy new book, ''The Prince of Tennessee,'' are a few telling glimpses of the vice president: Al Gore, at age 10, asking a teacher during a field trip, ''Sir, is this the time to be rowdy?''; Al Gore, as a Harvard sophomore during the escalating debate over Vietnam, organizing a protest against the dining room's nightly servings of fried chicken and gravy and lobbying for less-fattening fare; and Al Gore, running for Congress in 1976, bulling his way through nausea and nervousness, to prevail through sheer will.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maraniss and Ms. Nakashima tell us that Al Gore was a tattletale as a boy, and that he always played a cowboy when he played cowboys and Indians. They tell us that he was a plodding but tenacious basketball player who invariably ended up in foul trouble; that Harvard classmates occasionally allowed him into their all-night poker games ''with the understanding that they would teach him how to play while relieving him of his money, a few hundred dollars at a time''; that he once contemplated writing a book called ''Salt III'' about ''the different ways sodium affects our lives.''</p>

        <p>THE PRINCE OF TENNESSEE  The Rise of Al Gore  By David Maraniss  and Ellen Nakashima  323 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $23.</p>
        <p>Scattered throughout David Maraniss and Ellen Nakashima's flimsy new book, ''The Prince of Tennessee,'' are a few telling glimpses of the vice president: Al Gore, at age 10, asking a teacher during a field trip, ''Sir, is this the time to be rowdy?''; Al Gore, as a Harvard sophomore during the escalating debate over Vietnam, organizing a protest against the dining room's nightly servings of fried chicken and gravy and lobbying for less-fattening fare; and Al Gore, running for Congress in 1976, bulling his way through nausea and nervousness, to prevail through sheer will.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maraniss and Ms. Nakashima tell us that Al Gore was a tattletale as a boy, and that he always played a cowboy when he played cowboys and Indians. They tell us that he was a plodding but tenacious basketball player who invariably ended up in foul trouble; that Harvard classmates occasionally allowed him into their all-night poker games ''with the understanding that they would teach him how to play while relieving him of his money, a few hundred dollars at a time''; that he once contemplated writing a book called ''Salt III'' about ''the different ways sodium affects our lives.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the reader, the authors never pull together such anecdotes into a coherent portrait of Al Gore. A similar problem afflicted Mr. Maraniss's 1995 biography of Bill Clinton, ''First in His Class,'' but that earlier book seems a model of diligence compared to this hasty and perfunctory volume.</p>
        <p>''The Prince of Tennessee'' grew out of a series of articles for The Washington Post, and it still has a hurried, improvisational air. Though the authors contend that ''many of the behavioral patterns of the figure who would run for president in 2000 are best explained by the boy he once was,'' their book hops and skips through Mr. Gore's youth, and it proves even more arbitrary and desultory in dealing with his political career.</p>
        <p>There is no serious assessment of Mr. Gore's record in Congress or his performance as vice president and no real grappling with such controversies as his involvement in the 1996 campaign finance scandals or his changing views on abortion. Any reader looking for a carefully considered appraisal of the vice president's life and career would be better off reading Bill Turque's biography ''Inventing Al Gore,'' recently published by Houghton Mifflin.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Turque, Mr. Maraniss and Ms. Nakashima repeatedly use terms like ''cautious,'' ''self-righteous'' and ''competitive'' to describe Al Gore, adjectives that readily come to mind to anyone who has watched him on television or followed accounts of him in the press. Once again we are told about the pressures the young Al Gore faced in living up to the expectations of his father, Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee. Once again we hear about his halfhearted efforts to rebel against a destiny in politics. And once again we hear about his love of facts and his tendency to follow his head over his heart.</p>
        <p>In his writings on President Clinton, Mr. Maraniss has frequently spoken of his vacillation between idealism and opportunism, and in the case of Mr. Gore, he and Ms. Nakashima come up with a similar equation, arguing that the vice president has always moved between two poles: between ''farsightedness and caution, selflessness and self-aggrandizement,'' between ''principle and expediency,'' politeness and a ''studied viciousness.''</p>
        <p>One of the keys to Mr. Gore's behavior, the authors suggest, is an insecurity that they say many of his former aides believe ''brought out his tendency to be bureaucratic, defensive about his turf, wooden in public presentation, prone to exaggerate his own accomplishments, impressed by resumes and the conventions of the establishment, and more timid than he wanted to be.''</p>
        <p>Like so much in this sloppy book, this assessment of Mr. Gore is contradicted by other observations made by the authors. In an early chapter they write that Al Gore, unlike Bill Clinton, never seemed driven to win the approval of strangers: ''he had a high enough opinion of himself''; what set him apart from his prep school classmates, they write, was ''his air of supreme confidence.'' Later they suggest that overconfidence played a significant role in his failed 1988 run for the White House, a run fueled, they imply, by a hubristic desire to place himself in a grand 28-year historical cycle, going back to Teddy Roosevelt (1904), F.D.R. (1932) and John F. Kennedy (1960).</p>
        <p>Although the authors point out that ''there would be no great 28-year cycle,'' they add that Mr. Gore still shared a connection with the Kennedy tradition: ''Family tragedies. Prep schools, Harvard. Controversial fathers. Aggressive foreign/domestic policies. Expectations.''</p>
        <p>This is not the only case in which they demonstrate a knee-jerk inclination to ratify Mr. Gore's view of himself or to rationalize criticisms directed at him by other journalists. They argue, for instance, that his tendency to overstate his accomplishments (like taking credit for the Internet) should be put in a cultural context, namely ''a country storytelling style that he inherited from his father, built on grandiosity and hyperbole''; in any case, they add, ''manipulating reality is an inherent aspect of politics.''</p>
        <p>They note that Mr. Gore -- who wrote in his 1992 book ''Earth in the Balance'' that he was impatient with his own ''tendency to put a finger to the political winds'' -- has remained ''beholden to polls and conventional wisdom,'' ''relying on consultants to calibrate his image and message,''  but they nonetheless give him points for showing ''that he knew the person he wished he could be.''</p>
        <p>As for his environmental record as vice president, a record criticized by reporters like Bill Turque for demonstrating ''a pattern of passivity and timidity,'' the authors point out that Mr. Gore decided to attend the 1997 global-warming talks in Kyoto, Japan, in the face of pressure not to go. Never mind that the White House did not even attempt to send the treaty to Congress amid opposition from Republicans in the Senate: ''for those around him who had seen the struggle between his idealism and ambition and who knew how his insecurity could hold him back,'' Mr. Maraniss and Ms. Nakashima write, ''this was a victory of a deeper sort. He had found his gut.''</p>
        <p>This sort of reflexive eagerness to pat Mr. Gore on the back, combined with an unwillingness to assess his record rigorously, underscores the cursory nature of this book, a volume that in the end feels less like a real book than a patched-together production brought out to cash in on the fall campaign.</p>
