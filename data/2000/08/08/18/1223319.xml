        <p>Seattle is 2,895 miles northwest of New York City. Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel information:</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>ALEXIS, 1007 First Avenue, (206) 624-4844. A graceful, century-old 109-room classic, this is a member of the boutique chain assembled by the California hotelier Bill Kimpton. The public spaces are filled with the work of regional artists (including several vibrant Dale Chihuly glass sculptures), and the bright bedrooms are decorated with cheerful, traditional fabrics. No view, but you waken to the sound of sea gulls and foghorns. Terrific Aveda spa. Double rooms from $230.</p>

        <p>Seattle is 2,895 miles northwest of New York City. Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel information:</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>ALEXIS, 1007 First Avenue, (206) 624-4844. A graceful, century-old 109-room classic, this is a member of the boutique chain assembled by the California hotelier Bill Kimpton. The public spaces are filled with the work of regional artists (including several vibrant Dale Chihuly glass sculptures), and the bright bedrooms are decorated with cheerful, traditional fabrics. No view, but you waken to the sound of sea gulls and foghorns. Terrific Aveda spa. Double rooms from $230.</p>
        <p>FOUR SEASONS OLYMPIC, 411 University Street, (206) 621-1700. Grand with a capital G: a lobby straight from a Renaissance palace, a blossom-filled garden court, a shopping arcade where you can buy a ball gown or an antique candelabrum, and a windowed rooftop pool. This is a dowager, built in the 1920's, but very well preserved. Even the smaller rooms have duvets and luxurious bathrooms. Do you need a notary public, a shoe shine or maybe a car wash? Just ask. Double rooms from $230.</p>
        <p>INN AT THE MARKET, 86 Pine Street, (206) 443-3600. Lean, understated, enlivened with touches of Asia and Provence, this is a discreetly distinguished little hotel -- especially if you can snag a room like 514, a suite that looks down on the Pike Place Market and beyond to Elliott Bay and the peaks of the Olympic Peninsula. Fax machines, kitchenettes and even orchids in the bedrooms. Betsey and I wish there were one of these in every city we visit. Double rooms from $170.</p>
        <p>W, 1112 Fourth Avenue, (206) 264-6000. Hard-edged, high-tech decor, soft-edged service from a black-clad staff -- an apt combination for Seattle. The lobby is small, crowded and noisy, but the 428 guest rooms are quiet and comfortable, with 250-count sheets and CD libraries. The restaurant, Earth &amp; Ocean, is the latest brainstorm of the mini-mogul Drew Nieporent. But the coveted silver ''W'' yo-yo's are available only through the catalog. Double rooms from $239.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>CAMPAGNE, 86 Pine Street, (206) 728-2800. Peter Lewis, a model of warmth and charm, offers deeply satisfying French food, steering a course north of bistro banality and south of nouvelle nonsense. One night recently, my tart of crunchy, slightly sour chard made an ideal introduction to a dish of unctuous braised pork cheeks. Betsey's seafood boudin, though lighter, was no less tasty. The wines, mostly French, are carefully chosen and gently priced.</p>
        <p>CANLIS, 2576 Aurora Avenue, (206) 283-3313. Fifty years old this year, a classic room in stone and redwood cantilevered over Lake Union, Canlis has been revitalized by a new chef, Greg Atkinson. He has nudged the menu toward seasonal and regional authenticity with lime-seasoned raw Alaskan scallops and Frog Hollow Farm peaches, while keeping the succulent steaks and chops that made the house's name. The service is silky, the wine list the area's best.</p>
        <p>DAHLIA LOUNGE, 2001 Fourth Avenue, (206) 682-4142. Tom Douglas is Seattle's premier restaurateur, and this is his premier restaurant. Japanese lanterns, red walls and music from the 30's, 40's and 50's cast a casual glow over the delicious Asian-accented food. Six little fishy bites (for example, albacore with ponzu sauce) come nestled in ice; a slab of grilled Alaska king salmon rests on a chowder of tart sorrel leaves and sweet corn. Coconut cream pie with fresh coconut for dessert. No wonder they shot a scene for ''Sleepless in Seattle'' here a few years back.</p>
        <p>HERBFARM, 195 Northeast Gilman Boulevard, Issaquah, (206) 784-2222. Dinner here is a major production -- nine courses, six wines, five hours, $150 a head. But it's worth all that, and the half-hour drive east of downtown, to experience the food of Jerry Traunfeld, a culinary wizard who flavors duck with lavender and wild blueberries, slow-roasts salmon in a giant zucchini blossom, and pairs melon soup with tarragon ice. The results are absolutely thrilling.</p>
        <p>RAY'S BOATHOUSE, 6049 Seaview Avenue Northwest, (206) 789-3770. Ray's seafood is never less than impeccably fresh and soundly cooked, and on a fine summer's day what could be more enthralling than sitting on the deck, watching boats cross the sound, with a breeze mussing your hair? Manila clams steamed with beer, dill and butter, and sesame-crusted halibut with sticky rice make a dandy lunch, and there are 177 white wines to choose from. I counted.</p>
        <p>SAZERAC, 1101 Fourth Avenue, (206) 624-7755. Sick of salmon? Had it with halibut? Jan Birnbaum, the Louisiana-born owner of Catahoula in the Napa Valley, has established a lively Seattle beachhead for the cooking of the Southeast (pork barbecue), Southwest (crab and rock shrimp enchiladas) and Cajun country (crawfish beignets). His chicken and andouille gumbo is dense and dark, full of okra, fire and file. Open all day, seven days a week.</p>
        <p>SHIRO, 2401 Second Avenue, (206) 443-9844. This is the Plain Jane among Seattle's top restaurants, a starkly simple little place with plastic chairs and paper napkins. No matter; the sushi is superb.  We especially liked the shiro roll, made with mackerel, shiso and ginger, and sea urchin roe (uni), so soft and creamy it barely clung to the rice. Wasabi is hand ground here.</p>
        <p>WILD GINGER, 1401 Third Avenue, (206) 623-4450. Another of Seattle's favorites, Rick Yoder's pan-Asian brasserie moved this summer into handsome new multimillion-dollar quarters across the street from Benaroya Hall. It was jammed from the moment the doors opened. Japanese screens, origami lampshades and rattan chairs set just the right tone for a wide variety of satays, each served with a different sauce, and for authentic Thai and Malay curries. The baby boy choi is to die for.</p>
