        <p>In a potentially fundamental change to the way music has been packaged, at least three major record labels plan to begin selling songs over the Internet in a subscription format by the end of the year, enabling users to listen to or download a range of tracks for a flat fee.</p>
        <p>An executive from EMI Recorded Music said on Tuesday that the label expected to have a subscription service available by the end of September, while the Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment should have a service in place by the end of the year, said Bruce Hack, vice chairman at Universal.</p>
        <p>''We will be getting in with a subscription model by the end of the year,'' Mr. Hack said.</p>
        <p>The executives' statements came on the same day Universal announced that it would begin selling individual songs online for downloading. Starting later this week, the label will make 60 songs available on a dozen affiliate Web sites for $1.99, a price that includes the song, images of the artists and text of the lyrics. The songs are sold in an encrypted format that Universal says will make it possible only for the purchaser to listen to them, and impossible for them to be exchanged freely via e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>Other major labels are involved in similar trials, including EMI, which recently began selling 100 albums for downloading on July 18 from music retail sites. But critics of the industry consider the efforts an insufficient, desperate scramble to catch up with an underground Internet music economy they say threatens to pass the record labels by.</p>
        <p>The labels, critics point out, are selling a handful of titles online for $2 or so a song, while some 20 million people who have downloaded the software of Napster, the embattled online music start-up, are exchanging hundreds of thousands of songs free. Last week, a federal judge issued a temporary injunction ordering the effective shutdown of Napster, which the recording industry accuses of contributory copyright infringement. But an appeals court panel on Friday stayed the injunction pending trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hack and other executives say they have learned something from the popularity of Napster and services like it.</p>
        <p>The main draw of Napster is ''the unbelievable ease of use and selection,'' said Jay A. Samit, senior vice president of EMI. He added that he believed his company would have a viable business model ''if we can monetize the same ease of use and offer name brand selection.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Samit said the company would have a subscription model available within the next month, but he said the company was still working out key details.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hack said a subscription service could entail visitors' paying a monthly fee to download or listen to music available in a variety of categories, like genre or era.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, record companies have suggested a subscription service may borrow heavily from the look and feel of Napster, offering Internet users a search engine to find songs to download, but effectively adding a cash register, and with the songs encrypted to prevent their free and unfettered exchange.</p>
        <p>This would be distinct from a pay-per-song model in which users pay to download or listen to individual tracks.</p>
        <p>In May, Sony Music Entertainment and Universal said they were exploring a subscription model. Mr Hack said the subscription service, planned for a start by the end of the year, would be a product of that joint venture.</p>
        <p>Many issues, however, are unresolved, Mr. Samit said. For example, he said the labels needed to go back to artists and rewrite their contacts to permit their music to be included in a subscription-based service.</p>
        <p>One record industry executive said the contractual issues aside, the labels would probably have to make only 5,000 to 10,000 of their 200,000 title libraries available to meet consumer demand, which is concentrated among a few artists.</p>
        <p>Michael B. Nathanson, a record industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, described the development of subscription models as a substantial potential advance for the record labels, albeit one that begs several questions. He said the overriding issue was what the cost to consumers would be.</p>
        <p>''People are paying zero now,'' he said, referring to Napster.''</p>
