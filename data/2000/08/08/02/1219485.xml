        <p>Progress is measured in very small increments for Yatil Green these days. Make a cut without feeling a knee collapse. Get through another set of double practices without disaster. Make a catch that might finally garner some notice.</p>
        <p>These are baby steps for Green, a receiver and a former first-round draft pick of the Miami Dolphins, but it is on those slim accomplishments that Green hopes to build his chances to make the Jets' roster. Green signed with the Jets just days before training camp opened, and he has paid an enormous price for not being in the team's minicamps.</p>
        <p>While Laveranues Coles and Windrell Hayes were learning the playbook, Green was at home, tending to his aching knees, waiting for his agent to get him a contract. Green's participation in practice had been minimal since then and he did not play on offense during the Jets' preseason opener against the New Orleans Saints, a clear sign that Coach Al Groh was cool to him.</p>
        <p>While Coles was earning kudos for his big plays, Groh explained Green's absence by saying that he could only look at so many receivers at one time and the loop was simply not big enough to include Green.</p>
        <p>''If you know what to do and I'm convinced you're going to do it with full effort, I'll play you in the game,'' Groh said, adding that he was not necessarily speaking directly of Green.</p>
        <p>But Green has had a breakthrough in the last two days of practice. He made two difficult catches Monday, one a leaping, twisting reception in the back corner of the end zone over cornerback Otis Smith. And today, he had his best and most active practice so far, repeatedly catching passes all over the field.</p>
        <p>Given the quick hook given to the second-year running back Robert Farmer after his dismal performance on Saturday, it is safe to wonder if Friday's game against Green Bay will provide Green with his best chance to make an impression.</p>
        <p>''He was the only player starting from scratch with the systems when we started,'' Groh said. ''We were moving at a pretty fast pace for him. But now we're in the high 20's of practices we've had, so that's pretty good exposure. If he's picking it up here, that will create more opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Green is happy with just that much. After 10 knee surgeries and two seasons that ended in training camp, he seems to be at peace with the little signs of progress that now mark his career.</p>
        <p>While other players might have taken the lack of action in a game as an embarrassing slight, Green said he views every day in practice as an opportunity, one that, given his gruesome history of injury, could be his last.</p>
        <p>''It didn't bother me at all,'' Green said. ''It's like my rookie year all over again. I have to start from the bottom and work my way up. The more plays I make, the more confidence the coaches and quarterbacks will have in me. These guys have been here in the off-season. They worked extremely hard, made big plays. You have to applaud those guys. I got some opportunities yesterday and, fortunately, I was able to make plays.''</p>
        <p>Green still takes an unusually long time to loosen up his legs before practice, but ''once he gets going, he's still a burner,'' Wayne Chrebet said. Green is also practicing on special teams, a scary assignment for an injury-prone player, but one that is all but mandatory for someone with his speed who is fighting to make the team.</p>
        <p>While Green's future with the Jets is still a question, he may have shown, at least to himself, that he belongs somewhere in the league.</p>
        <p>''This is the most work I've done since the knee injury,'' Green said. ''I haven't missed a day in practice. After all I've been through, I'm just happy and blessed that I'm still here in the game.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>ERIC OGBOGU's feisty return to practice Monday, when he was ejected for fighting, drew a rebuke from Coach AL GROH. ''He has a history of those,'' Groh said. ''Some of the toughest players I've been around -- LAWRENCE TAYLOR, CARL BANKS, BRYAN COX, MARVIN JONES, CURTIS MARTIN -- I can't ever remember any of those guys being in a fight. I don't think getting into after-play fights distinguishes a player as being tough or intense. It distinguishes them as fighters.'' Ogbogu, who missed 12 days of practice with shoulder problems, apparently hurt himself in his fights and was held out of practice today. . . . The quick release of ROBERT FARMER, Groh said, was to some degree meant to send a message because Farmer did not live up to the standards Groh set for the team.</p>
