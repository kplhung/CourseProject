        <p>Scores of protesters were arrested in a running cat-and-mouse contest with the police across downtown thoroughfares today as they sought to disrupt the Republican National Convention with illegal hit-and-run demonstrations.</p>
        <p>The evening rush-hour traffic was turned into gridlock around City Hall as hundreds of young demonstrators, some of them masked with bandannas, blocked a main entrance of the interstate highway and strutted as they pleased at key points in the city, clogging intersections with only selective interference from the police.</p>
        <p>With the city intent on maintaining an upbeat convention gleam, the police clearly worked to avoid the sort of full-scale, baton-wielding clashes with street demonstrators that occurred last winter at the World Trade Organization conference and damaged Seattle's reputation. Demonstrators, on the other hand, clearly worked to steal the media spotlight and create street scenes of nonstop political protest as the focus for the 15,000 news workers here covering the Republican convention.</p>
        <p>The convention, three miles away, remained unfazed. But delegates increasingly watched the local television coverage of protests out beyond their meeting through the slower parts of their agenda. Some delegates reported inconvenience in journeying around protest-clogged streets to reach the convention arena in South Philadelphia. But none were heard demanding a more hard-edged response from city authorities.</p>
        <p>The Associated Press reported that at least 280 people had been taken into custody last night. The police said that four officers were injured and 20 patrol car windows smashed across the day of increasing disruption. A score of demonstrators, chanting denunciations of capital punishment, were arrested after blocking the westbound entrance to the interstate Vine Street Expressway north of City Hall.</p>
        <p>''The whole world is watching!'' they screamed, echoing the protest of the 1968 anti-war demonstrators on the chaotic streets around the Democratic convention in Chicago.</p>
        <p>And, indeed, the police seemed well aware of who was watching. They carefully read arrest warnings three times, then gingerly arrested the sit-in demonstrators while five news helicopters hovered and a platoon of reporters and photographers stood within a few feet.</p>
        <p>Protesters representing a score of causes seemed energized by the day, the most tense and chaotic thus far in the convention week. They vowed to deploy their darting street tactics further over the next two days.</p>
        <p>The American Civil Liberties Union accused the police of precipitating the uglier street mood today by raiding a West Philadelphia warehouse where protesters were preparing props and puppets for passive-resistance demonstrations.</p>
        <p>The police, to the contrary, said the warehouse was raided because it was being used as the planning headquarters for illegal disruptions of the convention week.</p>
        <p>Late tonight, the best evidence police could cite was that chicken wire and plastic tubing were found in the warehouse, which they contended were the ingredients of illegal protest material. Civil rights critics seized upon this as evidence only of gross over-reaction.</p>
        <p>''Police Commissioner John Timoney has taken off the velvet gloves to show the iron fist,'' said Stefan  Presser, legal director of the state A.C.L.U., contrasting the increasing tensions of today and the scene on Monday when the police chose to escort, rather than confront, welfare protesters in an illegal march for three miles down Broad Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Presser insisted the warehouse raid was provocative while the police said it was necessary. At the same time he deplored reports of some demonstrators resorting to vandalism and setting trash fires as they raced through the streets.</p>
        <p>''The whole city loses if this situation deteriorates,'' he warned.</p>
