        <p>Evander Holyfield has spent a lifetime building a reputation as a warrior, a true champion. But as he pursues another title in his long career, he finds himself answering questions of just how worthy his pursuit is.</p>
        <p>Holyfield will try to capture the heavyweight crown for the fourth time when he takes on John Ruiz for the vacant World Boxing Association championship in Las Vegas on Aug 12. But the belt they are fighting for was taken away from Lennox Lewis this year when Lewis refused to defend the title against Ruiz, who is ranked as the No. 1 contender, and opted instead to take on Michael Grant, whom he beat handily.</p>
        <p>That leaves Holyfield and Ruiz fighting for the belt, but Holyfield had a hard time convincing inquisitors yesterday that he deserved a chance to lay claim to the belt that he could not take from Lewis in the ring.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't feel that it's tainted,'' said Holyfield, who also has a long-range goal of taking Lewis's World Boxing Council and International Boxing Federation titles. ''Because I look at what this game's always been: when you don't follow rules and regulations, you lose your title.</p>
        <p>''I guess it would be the same question with Lennox, how he got his first belt. A lot of people didn't beat the champion. I look at that and say, 'Why does it have to be different with me?' I chose to go by the rules.</p>
        <p>''Actually, I feel I should be the champion now, but the decision didn't swing my way,'' Holyfield said. ''I decided to keep fighting, and the guy who was the best didn't follow the regulations and he forfeited his belt. I don't feel ashamed.''</p>
        <p>Holyfield has maintained his belief that the Nov. 13, 1999, decision he lost to Lewis that cost him his I.B.F. and W.B.A. titles was tainted, with the judges making up for a perceived slight against Lewis in a draw against Holyfield eight months earlier.</p>
        <p>''I think anybody that watched the fight knows that in that fight I did beat Lennox,'' Holyfield said. ''They bring up the first fight, but in the first fight they didn't take it from Lennox, either. The next fight people say they corrected and made it right, but they didn't. But that's no complaint.</p>
        <p>''I decided to fight because I believe in my ability to take it again. I have a goal, to be undisputed champion of the world. I fight for reasons. I have a goal. I believe that I'm the best even if I don't fight a guy.''</p>
        <p>Holyfield, who will turn 38 shortly after the fight, has compiled a 36-4-1 record in a career filled with highlights.</p>
        <p>But this fight, originally scheduled for June 10 before an injury to Holyfield caused a postponement, will be hard-pressed to be seen as one of them.</p>
        <p>For Ruiz (36-3), his biggest fight came four years ago when he faced David Tua and was knocked out in just 19 seconds.</p>
        <p>''How can I answer that?'' Ruiz said rhetorically. ''I put myself on the line so many times. First of all, I wanted to fight Michael Grant, then he decides to sign up with Lennox Lewis for a fight. Lennox totally avoided me. What am I to do?</p>
        <p>''I'm basically going out there, going by the rules and I'm the No. 1 contender in the W.B.C. and W.B.A., which I earned. Nothing I can say is going to change minds. I've definitely got a lot to prove,'' Ruiz said.</p>
        <p>''I don't really think much about Lennox Lewis. He's done a lot in his career, but I feel he'll never be the great champion like Holyfield, Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis.</p>
        <p>''I don't think when his career is done he'll be put in with those names. I feel that he just doesn't want to give a young guy a chance and follow the rules, basically.''</p>
        <p>Vargas's Task at Hand</p>
        <p>Fernando Vargas is also having a hard time keeping his attention on the task at hand, having to make his way past Ross Thompson (24-3-1) on Aug. 26 in Las Vegas before he can take on Felix Trinidad on Dec. 2, the fight he is looking forward to.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to get up for fight like this, to be honest with you,'' said the 22-year-old Vargas (19-0), the I.B.F. junior middleweight champion.</p>
        <p>''I have to get up for it, because I know after I get through this fight I've got Trinidad. That's my main objective.</p>
        <p>''I have to get this one out of the way fast. I want to look great. I'm training hard. I feel this is my big fight right now, not Trinidad.''</p>
