        <p>The New York Philharmonic's courtship of the conductor Riccardo Muti has ended, amicably, it appears, but with no success. It had been no secret that the orchestra was hoping to entice the perfectionist Italian maestro to take over the music director's post when Kurt Masur steps down in 2002. But Mr. Muti, who has a sure sense of his own desirability, was playing hard to get. He was essentially unwilling to scale back his European commitments, especially as the artistic generalissimo of La Scala.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the Philharmonic decided that for all Mr. Muti's brilliance and renown, the orchestra needed a full-time music director. Whatever one may say about the strengths and shortcomings Mr. Masur has brought to the job, no one has ever questioned his devotion to the New York Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>Now the orchestra must restart its search. And with major music director posts also up for grabs in Philadelphia and Boston, the process will not be easy.</p>
        <p>Conductors these days frequently have relationships with several orchestras at once. Still, that the Philharmonic was interested in someone, however illustrious, who indicated from the start that he would treat this important directorship as only one of several demanding posts says a lot, some of it troubling, about how the orchestra views the job. What can be learned from what happened? How might the orchestra adjust its thinking?</p>
        <p>A music director's job has two major components, especially in an international music center like New York. Obviously, the Philharmonic must have a brilliantly skilled and musically top-notch conductor, the kind of probing interpreter who can keep the players involved, especially in the standard repertory that audiences want to hear regularly. And if the candidate already has a well-known name and an extensive discography, as Mr. Muti does, that obviously makes the marketing department happy.</p>
        <p>But a music director in a big city should also be a dynamic artistic leader, someone who can forge ties with other performing and educational institutions, someone on close terms with living composers, an adventurous musician who treats performing new music not as some weighty obligation but as a bracing activity, a natural part of what musicians do.</p>
        <p>I have long felt that orchestras, especially in America, place too much emphasis on the brilliant conductor aspect of the music director job, when what is crucially needed are vibrant artistic leaders. Perhaps because America is still nursing a cultural inferiority complex, orchestras keep going after foreign heavyweights and older eminences, passing over younger, energetic Americans who could wake up a cultural community.</p>
        <p>Why not have a younger, idealistic and preferably American artistic director to run the orchestra day to day, a strong conductor, of course, but someone who could really galvanize the institution, conceive stimulating programs, commission worthy composers and reach out to the larger urban area? Then bring in the eminences and heavyweights as guests to perform the great repertory they are steeped in by cultural heritage and long advocacy. Sir Colin Davis serves this latter role well at the Philharmonic, as no doubt Mr. Masur will and should when his directorship ends.</p>
        <p>Orchestras would be wise to take more chances. Leonard Bernstein wasn't ''Leonard Bernstein'' when he was appointed to the Philharmonic post. He was a dynamic, not-yet-40 gamble, which is probably why for his first season, 1957-58, he was a joint principal conductor with Dimitri Mitropoulos, and only the next season was given the job for himself, becoming the first American music director of a major orchestra in the United States. Obviously the gamble paid off. Of course, by some accounts, for all the excitement that Bernstein engendered, the playing of the orchestra slipped during his tenure. Recordings from the Bernstein era suggest otherwise. And, unlike every foreign-born conductor in an American post today, Bernstein did not need an artistic adviser on staff to tell him what to do.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the Philharmonic feels it got burned by its experience with Zubin Mehta, who was 42 and hot when he was brought in to give the orchestra some pizazz after its noble experiment with the formidably intellectual Pierre Boulez, Bernstein's successor. But Mr. Mehta was not too young and hip; he was too flashy and superficial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Masur was recruited in 1991 to bring order to an orchestra that had grown unruly, to raise standards and to provide rigorous interpretive insights into the core repertory. He has succeeded on all counts. Yet the dismayingly conventional programming he has planned for next year suggests that he is creatively spent.</p>
        <p>He will begin the season with a mini-festival of Mendelssohn, a composer to whom he has a special claim, having directed the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, which Mendelssohn himself conducted for 12 years. Though this promises to be distinguished music making, it would be more welcome if the rest of the season were not so fixed in the Central European mainstream. There will be lots of Brahms, Schumann, Dvorak and Mozart. A concert in October, conducted by Leonard Slatkin, billed as ''honoring the memory of Leonard Bernstein,'' offers only one work of his, the ''Jeremiah'' Symphony; the bulk of the program is devoted to Mendelssohn's G minor Piano Concerto and Dvorak's Eighth Symphony.</p>
        <p>To his credit, Mr. Masur will acknowledge the 75th birthday of the important German composer Hans Werne Henze with the American premiere of his Ninth Symphony and Beethoven's joyous ''Choral Fantasy'' as a curtain raiser. But for the most part when a new or recent work is performed (for example, a premiere by Oliver Knussen), it is sandwiched between crowd pleasers (in that case Bruch's Violin Concerto and Strauss's ''Also Sprach Zarathustra''). So don't be scared when you learn that Mr. Masur will conduct the New York premiere of Bright Sheng's ''Red Silk Dance'' for Piano and Orchestra; Emanuel Ax, the soloist in that work, will also play Liszt's Second Concerto on a program dominated by Brahms's Second Symphony. The message indirectly conveyed is that the orchestra is so afraid of trying something a bit daring that it must be packaged with reassuring favorites.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muti is a conductor of great stature. I will not soon forget the three concerts he presented last year at Carnegie Hall with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. The programs were traditional, the most recent work being Shostakovich's famous Fifth Symphony. But the playing was incomparable. Mr. Muti's authoritarian approach is suited, it would seem, to this virtually all-male, tradition-bound orchestra. Yet to his credit, Mr. Muti also got some exciting results from the New York Philharmonic in recent appearances.</p>
        <p>But what kind of artistic leader would he have made over the long term? It is hard to imagine what New York cultural or educational institutions Mr. Muti would have formed natural alliances with. It's equally hard to cite a modern composer with whom Mr. Muti has been associated the way, say, Esa-Pekka Salonen, the excellent young Finnish-born conductor of the Los Angeles Symphony, has been linked with Gyorgy Ligeti and Witold Lutoslawski. Mr. Salonen's artistic leadership has not drawn across-the-board praise. Many West Coast composers complain that in commissioning composers from his own generation, Mr. Salonen has favored Europeans he knows, which shows the major drawback of not having an American in charge.</p>
        <p>The word is that the Philharmonic musicians strongly wanted Mr. Muti. If true, it's curious. What were they thinking? Perhaps something along the lines of, ''Maestro Masur has raised the level of our Beethoven and Bruckner to a new high, and Maestro Muti will take it higher still.''</p>
        <p>Consider, in comparison, how Michael Tilson Thomas has turned concert night at the San Francisco Symphony into a cultural must for young and old alike. His programs are alive with new and recent works and neglected 20th-century repertory. Yet his audiences get plenty of Mahler and Brahms. At the opening concert of the orchestra's ambitious Stravinsky festival last summer, the audience could have been mistaken for a movie crowd in New York on Saturday night. Mr. Thomas is a great match for San Francisco, with a palpable connection to American music and strong ties to local composers.</p>
        <p>Robert Spano, 38, a superb technician and orchestra builder, might have been the kind of exciting, younger, thinking artistic director I'm calling for. Imagine the Philharmonic with Mr. Spano as its adventurous leader, someone with big ambitions but self-confident enough to regularly welcome eminent conductors as guests. Unfortunately, Mr. Spano knew that he was probably too young and too local (as the conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic) to get the Philharmonic job or any of the other major posts about to be vacated. So he accepted the Atlanta Symphony, a good orchestra, though perhaps not the best fit: Mr. Spano's innovative programming may be a hard sell for its conservative subscribers.</p>
        <p>Apparently the Philadelphia Orchestra is looking hard at the 41-year-old American conductor David Robertson. Though no celebrity, he would be an exciting choice. Mr. Robertson honed his conducting skills with complex modern music as an associate of Pierre Boulez in France. Two years ago he conducted thrilling performances of daunting works by Elliott Carter and Mr. Boulez with the New Juilliard Ensemble. As music director of the Orchestre National de Lyon, he has covered the standard repertory thoroughly. He has also conducted opera impressively, including Janacek's ''Makropoulos Affair'' at the Metropolitan. If the Philharmonic would adjust its thinking, Mr. Robertson could be an inspiring choice.</p>
        <p>Instead, among the names being leaked are two more foreigners with established reputations: Mariss Jansons, 57, the Latvian-born music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony and the associate principal conductor of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic in Russia, and Christoph Eschenbach, 60, the German chief conductor of the NDR Symphony in Hamburg. Both are perfectly fine conductors and solid musicians who would bring indisputable skills to the post. Neither would seem to be a lively risk-taker who might reach out to composers and invigorate the city's culture.</p>
        <p>Zarin Mehta, the Philharmonic's new executive director, is said to be high on both men. My guess is that either would be presented to the public as a conductor steeped in the European tradition and, though not as famous or dynamic as Mr. Muti, quite distinguished.</p>
        <p>True. But perhaps ''distinction'' has been overvalued in recruiting music directors to American orchestras. Just by being appointed to lead the New York Philharmonic, a less-well-known American would acquire instant distinction. And it would be refreshing to have someone truly imaginative and exciting, someone who respects the European tradition but is not cowed by it. It's something to think about. And now that Mr. Muti is out of the picture, there is time to do just that.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 3, 2000, Thursday  A picture caption yesterday with the continuation of a Critic's Notebook article about the New York Philharmonic's search for a music director misstated the affiliations of the conductor Robert Spano. He will join the Atlanta Symphony in the 2001-2 season; he is not there now. He is also remaining as conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic; he has not left.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 11, 2000, Friday  A Critic's Notebook article on Aug. 2 about the New York Philharmonic's search for a music director misstated the affiliation of the conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen. He is with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, not the Los Angeles Symphony.</p>
