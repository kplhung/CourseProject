        <p>Also going to the Sydney Summer Games are two veterans: Michael Chang, who won his only Grand Slam title 11 years ago, and Todd Martin, who has struggled since reaching the United States Open final last year. Missing will be Pete Sampras, who won Wimbledon last month, and Jan-Michael Gambill. Both declined to play, leaving a spot for the 81st-ranked Tarango, 31, the oldest player on the team.</p>
        <p>The men's team contrasts with the high-powered women's squad: Lindsay Davenport, Monica Seles and Venus and Serena Williams. But other well-known players are skipping the event, including Martina Hingis of Switzerland and Anna Kournikova of Russia. Jelena Dokic, Australia's top-ranked female player, said she would play only if organizers let her stay at home instead of in the Olympic Village, accredit her father as a coach and allow her to wear her sponsors' clothes. Australia's Olympic committee is negotiating with her.</p>
