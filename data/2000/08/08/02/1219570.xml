        <p>From the convention podium, Colin L. Powell fired a salvo at moneyed special interests. On the street, the police massed loudly in expectation of protesters against all manner of capitalistic evils.</p>
        <p>But in elegant Rittenhouse Square, where lobbyists and politicians gathered yesterday afternoon, an eight-piece swing band drowned out the noise, and white tents ensured that the business of business could carry on uninterrupted.</p>
        <p>''None of you can vote for me,'' a Senate candidate from Nevada announced to the crowd during a break in the music, ''but your checks will surely be welcomed.''</p>
        <p>Compassionate conservatism by night, liberal lobbying by day.</p>
        <p>The I.R.A.-Palooza! was thrown by the financial services industry to honor members of Congress who helped win a vote on increasing limits on retirement accounts. But it was like many other parties and receptions given by those with policy interests (and money) and those  seeking policy advice (and money).</p>
        <p>''I'll give you six words why you should back me with your faith and your financial support,'' Paul H. Rappaport announced confidently. ''I'm running against Paul Sarbanes.'' No rolls of coins came flying his way, but Mr. Rappaport said his appeal to help defeat Mr. Sarbanes, Maryland's veteran Democratic senator, has struck a chord at other receptions he has attended this week. ''People are just handing me checks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In his convention speech on Monday, Mr. Powell contrasted some Republicans' criticism of affirmative action ''that helped a few thousand  black kids'' with their silence on ''affirmative action for lobbyists who load our federal tax codes with preferences for special interests.''</p>
        <p>Lobbyists brushed off the flesh wounds. ''It was a nice rhetorical flourish,'' said Steve Bartlett, president of the Financial Services Roundtable. ''But it's mixing two issues.''</p>
        <p>Various business representatives pointed out that raising I.R.A. limits was supported by legislators in both parties and by millions of working people around the country. ''I don't believe I represent a special interest,'' said Bruce E. Thompson, a Merrill Lynch vice president for government relations. His company did sponsor a few other parties this week, not to mention its contribution to the Philadelphia host committee organizing the convention.</p>
        <p>One of those parties honored the House Commerce Committee, ''which just happens to have jurisdiction over the financial services industry,'' he said. ''Just as an aside.''</p>
        <p>Asides aside, none of the lobbyists were willing to take on Mr. Powell, by name. ''I'm not here to get any glory,'' one explained. Not that any was going around.</p>
        <p>Longing for the Old Days</p>
        <p>Phyllis Schlafly, the high priestess of the right wing and the anti-abortion movement, has been to every Republican convention since the last one in Philadelphia in 1952. Boy, were they a sight better in the old days, she says. This one is a snoozefest, said Mrs. Schlafly, looking trim and ready for action at 75, wearing plastic pearls the size of gumballs.</p>
        <p>''This is boring, boring, boring,'' she complained.</p>
        <p>''In 1952, Eisenhower was seven or eight votes away from the nomination. No one knew who the vice president was going to be. It was terribly exciting. There were floor fights.''</p>
        <p>''This . . .,'' she sighed, waving her hands dismissively.</p>
        <p>As that was not bad enough, she said, convention hall security confiscated a set of knitting needles two days ago from Gail Ruzicka, a staff member for Mrs. Schlafly's Republican National Committee For Life. Security guards worried the needles were dangerous, Mrs. Schlafly said. ''So they snapped them in half and ruined her knitting,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Heroes' Uneasiness</p>
        <p>The soldiers were on the big screens, ''The Marine Hymn'' filled the convention hall and, as far as Ralph Saulnier was concerned, the Republican Party was steaming into home port.</p>
        <p>''Being a veteran, I am caught up with this patriotism,'' Mr. Saulnier said. ''I think we should have more of it.'' He was all for Monday night's message of inclusion, complete with a choreographed, racially coordinated cast, ''but they didn't need to repeat it over and over.''</p>
        <p>If Monday felt to some delegates as if the party was wandering into new territory, yesterday was a familiar pageant of heroes of Republican politics and the battlefield.</p>
        <p>''I think it's great to go back and honor history,'' said Frank Cox, a Texas delegate.</p>
        <p>But even last night, all was not tranquil under the big Republican tent. As Representative Jim Kolbe of Arizona, who is openly gay, took the podium to speak about international trade, some Texas delegates registered their disapproval.</p>
        <p>About 12 members of the Texas delegation removed their straw cowboy hats, closed their eyes and bowed their heads. One man held up a placard as he bowed his head. It read,  ''There is a way out.''</p>
        <p>Bob Reese, one of the praying delegates, would not explain the sign. He did say the delegates were praying for ''biblical guidance.''</p>
        <p>Even some welcomed into the tent realized that the rest of the convention might end up looking more like Republican conventions gone by.</p>
        <p>''I think the black participation will thin out,'' said Marcus Jenkins, a black delegate from Ohio. ''I think we've been through every black and minority in the party over the last day.''</p>
        <p>Reunion of Old Friends</p>
        <p>What happens in the Republican afterlife? Whatever it is, it must have something to do with steak and cable television.</p>
        <p>Or so yesterday's birthday lunch for Alfonse M. D'Amato, the loquacious former senator from New York, seemed to prove.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato celebrated his 63rd birthday at a steak house yesterday on Philadelphia's Walnut Street. Among the guests was Bob Dole, the former Republican presidential candidate, who has parlayed his presidential bid into a career promoting treatment for erectile dysfunction, and who last night was scheduled to begin his career as a political commentator on Comedy Central.</p>
        <p>After giving Mr. D'Amato a manly hug, Mr. Dole asked him if he had broken any furniture yet.</p>
        <p>A passel of Mr. D'Amato's former senatorial colleagues were on hand to fete him, as well as Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, who was once Mr. D'Amato's protege.</p>
        <p>At one point Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska shouted from the back of the room: ''We miss you, Al!'' It looked for a moment as if Mr. D'Amato might burst into tears. Mr.  Murkowski shouted again: ''And we miss Mama D'Amato!'' Mr. D'Amato's mother is known for her terrific Italian cooking. Mr. D'Amato brightened. Then he shot back: ''I'll send her down with Lazio!''</p>
