        <p>Homebodies</p>
        <p>For New York musicians weary of the festival circuit, the Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival offers a creative setting closer to home -- just the sort of respite its founder, the flutist Marya Martin, had in mind back in 1984. Tonight the festival inaugurates its 17th season with an all-Beethoven program in the historic and newly air-conditioned Bridgehampton Presbyterian Church. On Saturday evening, musicians, including the violinist Ani Kavafian, will present lighter fare at a benefit concert, followed by cocktails and dinner, at the Atlantic Golf Club in Bridgehampton, N.Y. Information and tickets: (631) 537-3507. All concerts are to be recorded for later broadcast on National Public Radio's ''Performance Today.''</p>

        <p>Words of Wisdom</p>
        <p>The beloved tales of Juan Bobo, the wise fool  of Puerto Rican folklore, lie at the heart of the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater's free summer tour. ''The Mischievous Juan Bobo'' sets the vagabond's best-known anecdotes to nostalgic music. The 23 performances, which run through Aug. 26 in collaboration with Teatro Circulo, will be taken to economically depressed areas in the five boroughs, as well as to sites in New Jersey and Allentown, Pa. The outdoor presentations are performed in Spanish, with an English synopsis available. Information: (212) 354-1293.</p>
        <p>More Than Music</p>
        <p>At the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, with the Pacific as a backdrop, the La Jolla Chamber Music Society's 15th annual Summer Fest gets under way tonight,  led by the husband-and-wife team of David Finckel, cellist, and Wu Han, pianist. This year's festival offers up the work of the composers in residence, Bruce Adolphe, Augusta Read Thomas and Joan Tower; the visual artists in residence, Dale Chihuly and Italo Scanga; and discussions. Performers include the pianist Leon Fleisher, who will be celebrated on Aug. 16, and members of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, including the violinist Ani Kavafian, the cellist Fred Sherry and the clarinetist David Shifrin, also the artistic director. Information: (858) 459-3728.</p>
        <p>Freedom Award</p>
        <p>After a two-year visiting professorship at Emory University, Archibishop Desmond Tutu is returning home to South Africa. He won't go empty-handed. On Saturday, Archbishop Tutu will receive the second International Freedom Conductor Award from the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati. Modeled after the Nobel Peace Prize, the award honors living individuals who have made significant contributions to freedom and human rights around the world. In 1998 the American civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks accepted the first award, which carries a purse of $30,000.</p>
