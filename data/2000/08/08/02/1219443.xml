        <p>The first time Lothar Matthaus saw Clint Mathis in a MetroStars practice, he told Coach Octavio Zambrano something the club already knew, that Mathis was a rare breed, a soccer player with the knack for scoring goals.</p>
        <p>Along with this goal-scoring prowess, the quickness of Mathis's first step freezes opponents and the power of his shot leaves opposing goaltenders quaking. The total package has given the blond and ever-smiling Mathis ample opportunity to run around like a crazy man covering his head with his MetroStars jersey after scoring a goal.</p>
        <p>And when the jersey goes over his head, it displays ''I</p>
        <p>NY'' on his T-shirt underneath. That public sign of affection has been Mathis's trademark since he joined the MetroStars from the Los Angeles Galaxy earlier this season.</p>
        <p>''Moving to New York was a great career move for me,'' Mathis said last week after a practice for the league's All-Star Game in Columbus, Ohio, in which he scored 106 seconds after the kickoff. ''I figured New York fans might think I still wanted to be in L.A. after I was traded, so I wanted to show how happy I was to be in New York.''</p>
        <p>The MetroStars are happy to have Mathis because he is a winner and makes the players around him better. His teams have lost only once in his 22 league games this season, nine with the Galaxy (5-0-4) and 13 with the MetroStars (10-1-2). Mathis has scored 9 goals this season, 6 in 11 starts for the MetroStars.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Mathis and the MetroStars (13-7-2) take a five-game winning streak to Washington to face the defending Major League Soccer champion and Eastern Division rival, D.C. United (5-13-6).</p>
        <p>Mathis, a 24-year-old from Georgia, is one of the players credited with the MetroStars' turnaround. His ebullient personality has complemented the team's chemistry and aided in the successful mix of young Americans with foreign players.</p>
        <p>''I don't think one person can turn around a whole team,'' Mathis said. ''It helped that we had guys coming in and developing the right chemistry. I just try to to my part. I just jumped on the New York bandwagon.''</p>
        <p>Zambrano, the first-year MetroStars coach, has helped Mathis make the leap. When Zambrano was the coach of the Galaxy, he made Mathis, out of the University of South Carolina, the sixth overall choice in the 1998 draft. Mathis was a sporadic starter for Los Angeles and scored 12 goals playing various positions during his two years for the Galaxy, but the MetroStars have used him exclusively as a striker.</p>
        <p>''My game has risen a notch this season because it's the first year that I'm playing a steady position in the league,'' Mathis said. ''It's the first time I'm playing consistently up front and it helps knowing what is expected of you.''</p>
        <p>Mathis has developed a great rapport with Adolfo Valencia, his partner in the attack. The two players from entirely opposite backgrounds and cultures -- Mathis is from Conyers, Ga., and Valencia from Buenaventura, Colombia -- communicate mostly with their feet because Valencia's English is limited to hello.</p>
        <p>Mathis started playing soccer at age 3, but he did not take up the game seriously until he was a senior after leading Heritage High School to two state championships.</p>
        <p>Mathis finished his career at South Carolina with 53 goals, including 15 game-winners. His knack for scoring (and injuries to Brian McBride and Joe-Max Moore) prompted the United States national team coach, Bruce Arena, to call Mathis for duty in the World Cup qualifying games.</p>
        <p>''I have to show Bruce that I can play at this level,'' Mathis said. ''I can't expect to go in and do a great job right away, but I have to prove that I'm worth being given a chance.''</p>
        <p>Mathis was on the bench in the tie in Guatemala and the loss in Costa Rica. Some people, like the MetroStars' general manager, Nick Sakiewicz, felt he should have been given a chance to play in the late stages against Costa Rica after Eddie Lewis kept missing scoring chances.</p>
        <p>''If Clint was in Lewis's position,'' Sakiewicz said, ''he would have put those chances away because he has ice in his veins.''</p>
