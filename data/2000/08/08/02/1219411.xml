        <p>WHAT I like most about jury duty are those two-hour lunch breaks with all of Chinatown before me. The opportunity to sample a grilled turnip cake here or a stick of Chinese pork jerky there is irresistible. And when I am finished with the street food and ready to sit down, a favorite place is Nha Trang, one of the Vietnamese restaurants nestled like grains of rice on Baxter Street.</p>
        <p>Nha Trang, though dingy and plain, has become increasingly popular and crowded at lunch. Rather than turn away customers, the owners opened a second, equally plain restaurant a block west on Centre Street, practically under the grim facade of the Manhattan Detention Complex, offering much the same menu of delectable Vietnamese specialties amid a sea of other dishes that seem more Chinese.</p>

        <p>WHAT I like most about jury duty are those two-hour lunch breaks with all of Chinatown before me. The opportunity to sample a grilled turnip cake here or a stick of Chinese pork jerky there is irresistible. And when I am finished with the street food and ready to sit down, a favorite place is Nha Trang, one of the Vietnamese restaurants nestled like grains of rice on Baxter Street.</p>
        <p>Nha Trang, though dingy and plain, has become increasingly popular and crowded at lunch. Rather than turn away customers, the owners opened a second, equally plain restaurant a block west on Centre Street, practically under the grim facade of the Manhattan Detention Complex, offering much the same menu of delectable Vietnamese specialties amid a sea of other dishes that seem more Chinese.</p>
        <p>Why so many Chinese dishes? China's nearness to Vietnam and its influence on Vietnamese cuisine are undeniable, but the nearness of Nha Trang to Chinatown and its potential clientele is a more likely explanation.</p>
        <p>At lunch on a weekday, the local Chinese and Vietnamese customers are joined by courthouse regulars and possibly more cell phones than at a convention of movie executives. One lawyer in a tie and short-sleeve shirt can't bother to put his phone down to order: ''You got chicken? I just want chicken, plain, no sauce, you know what I mean? And some vegetables, steamed, on the side, no sauce. And coffee, regular.''</p>
        <p>I don't know why he came to a Vietnamese restaurant, but I know why I'm there. With an emphasis on fresh herbs and vegetables, Vietnamese is one of the most satisfying cuisines in warm weather. Nha Trang's cool beef salad ($6.75) is a perfect summer lunch, the pleasantly charred meat resting on crisp lettuce, sprouts and marinated carrots, with fragrant mint and basil and some chili heat, all dressed with nuoc cham, the sweet and pungent Vietnamese condiment. Yet, on a chilly, rainy day, few dishes are as comforting as pho tai ($3.75), the renowned North Vietnamese beef broth with rice noodles. Nha Trang's comes with impossibly thin slices of tender beef, rare when they arrive, which cook gently in the hot broth. Sprouts and fresh herbs on a platter alongside are to be added to the soup.</p>
        <p>Familiar dishes are flawless, like chao tom ($6.75), grilled shrimp paste wrapped around a short stalk of sugar cane. You remove the shrimp, place it on a large lettuce leaf with mint and marinated vegetables and dip it in nuoc cham, like crisp fried spring rolls ($3.95) and banh xeo ($6.75), a crisp-bottom  Vietnamese pancake with shrimp and mushrooms, which you also wrap in lettuce. Shrimp and rice vermicelli summer rolls, wrapped in soft rice paper ($3), are dipped instead in nuoc leo, a peanut sauce.</p>
        <p>Grilled dishes are also superb, like little cylinders of sweet and savory barbecued beef over rice vermicelli ($4.25), thin and tender barbecued pork chops ($7) and chicken breasts marinated in lime and spices ($6.75). I loved a special of soft-shell crabs ($16), coated in a caramel sauce and fried. Chicken with curry sauce ($8.50) is mild, tasting of curry powder, coconut milk and lemon grass.</p>
        <p>In dishes that seem Chinese, like stir-fried asparagus with shrimp and crab in oyster sauce ($6.50), you can practically taste the sense of obligation. But stir-fried water spinach ($6.75), which the menu poetically calls ''hollow vegetables with garlic sauce,'' is excellent</p>
        <p>Stick with the more obvious Vietnamese dishes, turn off the cell phone and get yourself back to the courtroom on time.</p>
