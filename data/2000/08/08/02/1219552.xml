        <p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers said yesterday that 158,000 Internet users signed up during its first at-large membership registration period. The program is intended to give Internet users a voice in the nonprofit technical group's policy making structure for administering the Internet's domain name and numbering systems. ''Now the task is to find good candidates who will engage in constructive debate about Icann's activities and specific policies,'' Esther Dyson, chairwoman of the group, which is known as Icann, said.</p>
