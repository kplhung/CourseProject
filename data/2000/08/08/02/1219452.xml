        <p>MEXICO: PLEA TO END DRUG CERTIFICATION -- President-elect Vicente Fox will propose ending Washington's certification of Latin American countries' anti-drug efforts when he meets with President Clinton on Aug 24, said Aguilar Zinser, a foreign relations adviser to Mr. Fox. The certification program has been criticized as a symbol of American domination, and countries that refuse to take part risk losing economic benefits. Mr. Zinser argued that the United States should instead help set up a regional anti-narcotics group made up of countries fighting the drug trade.</p>

        <p>VENEZUELA: ELECTION UNREST -- President Hugo Chavez sent troops to quell disturbances over disputed regional election results as several opposition candidates refused to accept defeat in general elections last Sunday. Tensions were particularly high in the state of Merida, where the latest results showed a pro-Chavez candidate, Florencio Porras, edging out the incumbent, Gov. William Davila, by less than 1 percent.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: ABDUCTION ACCUSATION -- The police said they had arrested eight people suspected of abducting Stevan Todorovic, a former Bosnian Serb police chief indicted by the United Nations for war crimes, from inside Serbia and handing him over to NATO troops in 1998. On Monday, Yugoslav authorities said they had detained four Dutch citizens who were trying to kidnap and possibly kill Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, who was indicted last year on charges of ordering war crimes in Kosovo.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: GAS PRICE STRIKE -- Motorists enraged by gasoline prices exceeding $4.80 a gallon staged a rare protest by refusing to fill their gas tanks. Organizers said they hoped to stage regular protests to urge the government to lower taxes, which account for three-quarters of the pump price of gasoline.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: ALERT IN CHECHNYA -- Russian troops sealed off Chechnya's second-largest city, Gudermes, in anticipation of a possible surge in rebel attacks in coming days to mark the first anniversary of the conflict in the separatist republic. An armed incursion by Islamic militants a year ago into the neighboring republic of Dagestan led to the current Russian military crackdown in Chechnya.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: TRASH SURVIVORS SUE -- Survivors of the collapse of a mountain of garbage in the capital, Manila, filed a class-action suit against local officials and private waste contractors, accusing them of negligence. At least 218 people -- and possibly hundreds more -- died when a rain-soaked wall of garbage buried their shanties on July 10.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: BOMB KILLS 3 -- A powerful bomb at the residence of the Philippine ambassador in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, killed 3 people and injured at least 21, including the ambassador. Muslim separatists in the Philippines denied responsibility. A number of bombs linked to the separatists have exploded recently in the Philippines.</p>

        <p>INDIA: ATTEMPTS TO FREE ACTOR -- A 10-year manhunt against the nation's most feared bandit was suspended as authorities tried to negotiate the release of a kidnapped movie icon, Rajkumar, taken prisoner by Veerappan, a notorious murderer, poacher and smuggler who operates in the forests of southern India. S. M. Krishna, chief minister of the state of Karnataka, said the police do not want to do anything that might further endanger Mr. Rajkumar.</p>
        <p>Barry Bearak (NYT)</p>
        <p>LAOS: NEW TERROR SCARE -- Residents reported that a bomb was found and defused at the Vietnamese embassy in the Laotian capital, Vientiane. The report was the latest in a series about bombings or attempted bombings. The discovery of the bomb came on Sunday, the same day that an explosive device was removed from the Vientiane airport and one day before a bomb killed several people at the central post office.</p>

        <p>KUWAIT: NO CLOSER TO IRAQ -- Kuwait's Foreign Minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, ruled out a resumption of ties with its former occupier, Iraq, in the near future and said his country intends to renew defense pacts with Western countries. He spoke in an interview published 10 years after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait.</p>

        <p>IRAN: WOMEN ALLOWED TO LEAD PRAYERS -- Muslim authorities have lifted the prohibition on women leading congregational prayers by members of their own sex, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The religious decree solves a longstanding problem in all-girl schools, where women had not been allowed to lead prayers. Muslims are required by their faith to pray five times a day and, if possible, to pray with a group of other Muslims.</p>

        <p>NIGERIA: 5TH STATE ADOPTS ISLAMIC LAW -- The northern state of Katsina began enforcing strict Islamic law, becoming the fifth state to bring in the code since Nigeria returned to civilian rule last year. Secular area courts were replaced with Islamic Shariah courts. Christians in the state are opposed, saying it is a violation of the 1999 Constitution.</p>
        <p>(Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>ZIMBABWE: STRIKE PLANNED -- The country's main labor movement called for a one-day strike today, to demand an end to what it terms intimidation and violence against government critics. The strike has been backed by labor, some businesses, farmers and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, making it the most broadly based challenge to President Robert Mugabe since the country's independence from Britain in 1980.</p>
