        <p>NICHOLAS O'CONNELL worked like a surgeon, his movements small, precise. He reached for his tools, handled them like crystal and was so quiet he barely seemed to breathe. His task complete, he changed roles. He looked up, his suit still crisp, every blond hair on his head in place. His inner host emerged. And he handed me his masterpiece: a cappuccino.</p>
        <p>A real one, like those you can find in train stations in Italy. Thick, creamy, so evolved that sipping is an impossibility. The cappuccino goes down in a long, charged stream.</p>
        <p>What makes it different? Excellent beans and equipment, surely, but also an acute sense of what a good cup of coffee should be. But more on that later.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connell, 29, works for La Colombe Torrefaction, a coffee roasting company and cafe in Philadelphia. Dressed like a banker, he travels to New York several times a week to visit restaurants like Alain Ducasse, Jean Georges and Daniel, among others. He makes sure their coffee machines, which they buy from him, are in order and meticulously clean, that the restaurants don't overgrind their beans and that the staffs' technique stays honed.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connell is a detail man. Since the flavor of the water used is so important to good coffee, Mr. O'Connell also checks on the restaurants' filtration systems. Likewise, he tests brands of milk and recommends his favorites to the restaurants. (In New York, he likes Marcus Dairy Inc.)</p>
        <p>Call him a technician or a consultant. But Mr. O'Connell is really more a prophet, spreading the philosophy of his boss, Jean-Philippe Iberti, who founded La Colombe in 1994 with Todd Carmichael.</p>
        <p>Mr. Iberti, 33, came to the United States from France in the late 1980's to study flight engineering in Seattle but ended up working for a coffee roaster there. He liked the business and decided to go out on his own. He chose Philadelphia because warehouse space could be rented cheaply and because . . . well, because there was no good coffee there.</p>
        <p>He opened a small cafe on 19th Street near Rittenhouse Square. It is a spare room with high ceilings and just a few tables and wood chairs. The croissants are usually sold out before noon. Then it is just coffee, Mr. Iberti's way. Double mocha skim lattes with no foam are discouraged. But you can get an espresso whose flavor will stay with you all day. ''The product is first,'' he said. ''The customer is second.''</p>
        <p>The beans, which Mr. Iberti buys from growers all over the world, are blended before being roasted gently, 15 minutes as opposed to the typical 5. The result, in an espresso, is a small shot that is light and caramelly, with bitterness and acidity that are deliberate but quiet.</p>
        <p>The company sells five varieties of beans by mail order for $9.55 to $10.45 a pound. The minimum order is one pound, and shipping is $4; (800) 563-0860.</p>
        <p>La Colombe cafe sells 1,500 cappuccinos and lattes a day, and that is where the flair comes in. The milk is steamed so that it becomes dense and creamy, with almost no distinction between foam and milk. It is not merely poured on top of the espresso, but fashioned to look like a feather, a leaf, a heart or a minimalist grouping of lines.</p>
        <p>La Colombe only recently began taking on restaurant clients outside Philadelphia. In addition to New York, they are in Boston and San Francisco. That's where Mr. O'Connell steps in.</p>
        <p>''The hardest part,'' he said, ''is not the technique, but to teach people to take their time and pay attention to their senses.''</p>
        <p>And learn what a good cappuccino is. One must taste, taste, taste.</p>
        <p>''The first thing we do is make them a great cup of coffee,'' he said. ''If they can develop a taste, they can remember what it should look like and the way it should be.''</p>
        <p>STEP 1: Fill a stainless steel pitcher halfway with cold whole milk. If the milk is not cold, a dry foam will be produced. Place the head of the steamer  1/2 inch below the surface of the milk and at an angle, aiming for the bottom rim. If the head is too deep, it will heat the milk without foaming; if it is too close to the surface, you will get big bubbles.</p>
        <p>STEP 2: Steam the milk on high until it is rolling. It should rise quickly in the pitcher. There is no reason to move the pitcher up and down, as you may have seen it done in coffee shops.</p>
        <p>Feel the side of the pitcher with your palm. It should be very hot, but not too hot to touch. If you heat the milk too much, it will smell like cheese. If you use an instant-read thermometer, the proper temperature is 155 degrees.</p>
        <p>Remove the pitcher from the steamer and let it sit while you make the espresso.</p>
        <p>STEP 3: Just before serving, swirl the milk and foam in the pitcher. The milk will suspend itself in the foam, moistening it and giving it a sturdy, creamy feel. If this is done correctly the foam will go from being matte to being as shiny as Italian meringue.</p>
        <p>Pour the milk directly in the center of the cup, so that the crema on the espresso comes up and around the sides in a neat, thick rim the color of dulce de leche.</p>
        <p>STEP 4: To make a heart shape, pour the milk in the center of the cup. With the pitcher's spout near the surface, quickly draw it upward in a straight line through the top of the circle to the edge of the cup. The heart will be upside down.</p>
