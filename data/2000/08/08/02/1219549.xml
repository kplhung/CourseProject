        <p>There is no evidence that the Brady law requiring background checks of handgun buyers contributed to a reduction in homicide rates after it went into effect in 1994, according to a study published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
        <p>The authors of the study, Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy at Duke University, and Jens Ludwig, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, suggested that the Brady law did not go far enough.</p>
        <p>The law requires background checks only for those who bought handguns from federally licensed firearms dealers and does not cover the unregulated market involving an estimated 30 percent to 40 percent of all sales, like gun shows and private transactions, where criminals and juveniles often buy handguns.</p>
        <p>The study, which, like all journal studies, was subject to peer review before publication, was immediately controversial at a time when gun control in general and the Brady law in particular are deeply enmeshed in the current national political debate.</p>
        <p>The study's conclusion was challenged by the Clinton administration and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, which pushed for the law, and by other researchers who called it misleading.</p>
        <p>James Johnson, the undersecretary of the Treasury for enforcement, said Justice Department figures have shown that crimes committed with handguns fell 52 percent from 1993 to 1998, which is twice the rate that crimes fell over all.</p>
        <p>The Brady law, new techniques for tracing guns used in crimes by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and other efforts all led to the drop, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>While the new study does not dispute those figures, its authors contend the drop is related to an overall decline in crime and that the Brady law is not a significant factor.</p>
        <p>The study's authors compared two sets of states: Thirty-two states that installed the law in 1994 and 18 states plus the District of Columbia, all of which have had Brady-style restrictions for much longer.</p>
        <p>The authors said that based on their statistical analysis, the decline in handgun homicide in the new states with the Brady law should have been much more rapid if the law had really had an effect.</p>
        <p>Douglas Weil, director of research at the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, disagreed with the findings.</p>
        <p>Among other things, Mr. Weil said, the study did not allow the authors to measure how big an impact the Brady law had on interstate gun trafficking, in which states that previously had no background checks or waiting periods had long provided a ready source of supply for traffickers who illegally resold guns in states that did have such restrictions.</p>
        <p>After the Brady law went into effect, Mr. Weil said, he found that some states with lax gun laws, including Virginia, Georgia, South Carolina and Ohio, were as much as 86 percent less likely to be the sources of guns used in crimes in states like New York, New Jersey or Illinois that already had restrictive laws.</p>
        <p>To underscore this point, Mr. Johnson said 44 percent of the A.T.F.'s investigations of gun trafficking cases involved guns being sold illegally from one state into another.</p>
        <p>Therefore to gauge how much the law reduced homicides, a study would have to look nationwide, not just compare those states that had background checks before 1994 with those that had to enact them under the Brady law, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Also, Mr. Weil said, there has been a sharp reduction in the percentage of robberies and assaults committed with guns since the Brady law went into effect, saving an estimated 9,368 lives from 1994 to 1998.</p>
        <p>Separately, two studies by Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California at Davis, have found that California laws requiring background checks of convicted felons and criminals who committed violent misdemeanors reduced crimes committed with guns by 25 percent to 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wintemute, in another study, also published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, found strong new evidence that a small number of suspect federally licensed firearms dealers are responsible for a disproportionate number of handguns that end up being used in crimes.</p>
        <p>The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has reported that of the 83,272 federally licensed dealers in 1998, 1.2 percent, sold 57 percent of the guns used in crimes that the agency was able to trace. The gun industry has complained that this finding is unfair, because the A.T.F. was not able to distinguish between large stores, with high sales volumes, and dealers who were knowingly selling to traffickers.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Wintemute found that 8.6 percent of dealers in California sold 82.7 percent of the handguns used in crimes there in 1998, though these same dealers accounted for only 33.2 percent of all handgun sales during the period from 1996 to 1998.</p>
        <p>Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun industry trade association, said the gun industry ''absolutely supports'' more tracing of guns if there are corrupt dealers selling to criminals. But he cautioned that there might be other explanations for so many guns' being traced back to a dealer.</p>
