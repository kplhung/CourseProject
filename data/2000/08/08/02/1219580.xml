        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani behaved like a good Republican today as he went to a fund-raiser for Representative Rick A. Lazio, held a joint news conference with Mr. Lazio and gave interviews to two networks -- all while attending his first national political convention.</p>
        <p>''I very strongly support Rick Lazio and urge everyone that at least wants to listen to me to vote for him,'' Mr. Giuliani said at the news conference, which lasted 10 minutes. Later, at the fund-raiser, which the mayor attended with his friend Judith Nathan, Mr. Giuliani thanked the crowd for ''supporting Rick and for making certain that I don't have to spend the last year that I'm the mayor of New York City with Hillary as the senator.''</p>
        <p>Four years ago, the mayor, who had endorsed a Democrat for governor (Mario Cuomo) and then barely endorsed a Republican for president (Bob Dole), showed such disdain for his party's convention in San Diego that he was not even invited.</p>
        <p>''They didn't allow Governor Wilson to speak, haven't allowed Governor Weld to speak, and they tried to constrict Pataki's remarks to such a degree that he didn't want to speak,'' Mr. Giuliani told reporters at the time, referring to the moderate Republicans Pete Wilson of California, William F. Weld of Massachusetts and George E. Pataki of New York.</p>
        <p>How times have changed. During the prime-time speeches tonight, the mayor was not sitting with the New York delegation, but next to Cindy McCain, whose husband, Senator John McCain of Arizona, was a featured speaker and a friend of the mayor's. He was also situated one row in front of the elder Bushes and Nancy Reagan.</p>
