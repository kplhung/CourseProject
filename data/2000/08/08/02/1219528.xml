        <p>The broadcast networks have not given the Republican National Convention one minute more than they have to, and they are absolutely right. The most telling television image, after all, has been that of Peter Jennings against a blank blue screen. As he has several times during ABC's coverage, last night Mr. Jennings gave audiences full disclosure that whenever he looks as if he is in a sky box, he is really in a small room on the convention floor, projected against video of the crowd outside the room.</p>
        <p>ABC's head of special news events, Marc Burstein, said this not only saved the network several hundred thousand dollars, by not converting a skybox to an anchor booth, but also allowed the anchor to report from the convention floor and then scoot quickly to a peaceful interview space.</p>

        <p>The broadcast networks have not given the Republican National Convention one minute more than they have to, and they are absolutely right. The most telling television image, after all, has been that of Peter Jennings against a blank blue screen. As he has several times during ABC's coverage, last night Mr. Jennings gave audiences full disclosure that whenever he looks as if he is in a sky box, he is really in a small room on the convention floor, projected against video of the crowd outside the room.</p>
        <p>ABC's head of special news events, Marc Burstein, said this not only saved the network several hundred thousand dollars, by not converting a skybox to an anchor booth, but also allowed the anchor to report from the convention floor and then scoot quickly to a peaceful interview space.</p>
        <p>But the blue background conveys more than anyone intended. The void behind the anchor is the perfect symbol for the nothingness that the networks have been dropping by to cover, and that the all-news cable channels have blanketed, with deadly dullness. Even for people fascinated by politics, last night was the perfect time to catch up with ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''</p>
        <p>The convention is such an acknowledged non-news circus that Dan Rather on CBS called it an infomercial. Politics has become show business, so the networks are reviewing the show, and analyzing the message it means to send. Yesterday Mr. Jennings, in his daily e-mail greeting to viewers of ''World News Tonight,'' defended the coverage in just those terms: ''The challenge is to see the way the party presents itself, and try to get you at home to match the image with the record.''</p>
        <p>Whatever scraps of enlightenment there were came from poking holes in the slick packaging. Most conspicuously, every channel and nightly newscast contrasted Monday's minority-loaded Republican show with the overwhelmingly white makeup of the convention itself. And last night, planned as National Security Night (there's a catchy show title), was full of women, offsetting any possible macho tone. Speakers included Condoleezza Rice, George W. Bush's foreign policy adviser, and Elizabeth Dole. (Among major networks, only PBS carried her speech; that's the sign of a falling star.)</p>
        <p>On cable, there was enough hot air to knock a viewer unconscious. Tim Russert, on MSNBC, heralded the importance of last night's speakers by speculating that if Mr. Bush won, Ms. Rice might be his national security adviser. (Or not.) This is surely the find-the-silver-lining approach to a nonevent. PBS, the only broadcast network offering full evenings of the convention, was just as soporific.</p>
        <p>The dullness of the Republican show may justify the networks' near absence, but that doesn't let them off the hook. Viewers are being shortchanged, not because they are missing the convention, but because no one is replacing that lost prime time with more substantial, inventive campaign reporting.</p>
        <p>NBC, offering less broadcast time than the other networks because of its cable channel, MSNBC, is pointing to the future. But that idea is premature; networks still reach a far larger audience than cable.</p>
        <p>Look beyond prime time and you see how the Republicans' careful convention planning has backfired. John McCain may have lost the nomination but he has gotten a victor's share of air time. He almost dominated the past three days as he gave interviews (NBC's ''Today,'' CNN's ''Larry King Live'' and the ''CBS Evening News'' only begin the list) leading up to his prime-time speech last night. His was the only one carried by all the broadcast networks, surprisingly uninterrupted by commentary.</p>
        <p>But speeches themselves seem backward looking in this age of the sound bite, when there is no such thing as a captive television audience. A flick of the remote can send viewers from a speech by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf (who hovered over this television-ready convention on a video screen last night from the deck of a battleship) in search of a ''Seinfeld'' rerun. That means no one has to sit still for silver-lining coverage.</p>
