        <p>A company that operates two large health insurance plans in upstate New York has been fined $500,000 for violations that included deleting thousands of valid claims from its computer system and systematically underpaying claims in one category, the State Insurance Department said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The fine is one of the largest the department has imposed on a health insurance plan, said Terri Marchon, a department spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>The fine was imposed on HealthNow New York Inc., a nonprofit company based in Buffalo that operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York and Blue Shield of Northeastern New York. Together, the plans have about 750,000 subscribers.</p>
        <p>The superintendent of insurance, Neil D. Levin, said the violations occurred from 1995 until early this year. He said the underpayments involved outpatient psychiatric services, and added that the company had charged premiums for chiropractic coverage at rates that his agency had not approved.</p>
        <p>Don Ingalls, the company's vice president for governmental affairs, said the deletions were primarily the fault of an old and inadequate claims-processing system in the Northeastern New York plan. He said a new system and other improvements had been introduced. The underpayments, he said,  stemmed from ''a difference of opinion about the regulation.''</p>
