        <p>Orientation at the Top</p>
        <p>While many universities are preparing for their new students, the City University of New York is preparing for its new presidents. In September, 5 of its 17 undergraduate campuses will have new presidents or acting presidents. CUNY gathered them last week for an orientation that covered everything from the budget to the new policy of phasing out remedial courses at the senior colleges. Attending the session at John Jay College were (left to right) EDWARD V. REGAN, Baruch College; BYRON N. McCLENNEY, Kingsborough Community College; GAIL O. MELLOW, La Guardia Community College; EDUARDO J. MARTI, Queensborough Community College; and RUSSELL K. HOTZLER, interim president, Queens College.</p>

        <p>While many universities are preparing for their new students, the City University of New York is preparing for its new presidents. In September, 5 of its 17 undergraduate campuses will have new presidents or acting presidents. CUNY gathered them last week for an orientation that covered everything from the budget to the new policy of phasing out remedial courses at the senior colleges.

        <p>New Headmistress at Catholic School</p>
        <p>For the first time in its 109-year history, the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic school for girls on the Upper East Side, will have a headmistress who is not a nun. The board of trustees, which is beginning a major campaign to increase the school's endowment and capital fund, has selected MARY BLAKE, an administrator at the United Nations International School, to succeed SISTER NANCY SALISBURY, who is retiring after serving as headmistress at Sacred Heart since 1980. Ms. Blake was principal of the Queens campus of the United Nations school for nine years and a development officer at the school for two years before that. In an interview, Ms. Blake, 52, who is Roman Catholic, said she hoped to strengthen Sacred Heart's ties to a worldwide network of schools run by the Sacred Heart order.</p>
        <p>Fellowships for Study in Asia</p>
        <p>Four college graduates from the New York City region are among the 20 winners of the Henry Luce Foundation's international fellowship program for 2000-2001: Ricshawn Adkins of Willingboro, N.J., who graduated from Princeton University; James Mackey of Boonton, N.J., from Tufts University; Jacob Tyler of Manhattan, from Harvard University; and Sandhya Vasan of Princeton Junction, N.J., from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>The program will allow the winners to work for a year in China, Mongolia, the Philippines and other Asian countries at professions like law and  astronomy. The scholars are to begin their assignments in September.</p>
        <p>The program's purpose is to develop a perspective on Asian problems and issues. HENRY LUCE III, chairman and chief executive of the foundation, heads the program, which was created in 1974 in honor of his late father, Henry R. Luce, the founder of Time magazine and the son of Presbyterian missionaries in China.</p>
        <p>Private Colleges Claim Exclusion</p>
        <p>The New York City Board of Education has been trying to bring people with little or no teaching experience to work in city schools  through an alternative certification program run in conjunction with the City University of New York. But other colleges are clamoring to be included.</p>
        <p>The program allows qualified college graduates to take a fast route toward certification, as long as they earn the equivalent of an education degree at CUNY.</p>
        <p>This effectively funnels potential students away from teacher education programs at the 23 private colleges in the New York region, like New York University, Columbia Teachers College or Long Island University, according to JAMES C. ROSS, president of the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities, an association of private colleges in New York State. In June, Mr. Ross sent letters of protest to Schools Chancellor HAROLD O. LEVY and Regents Chancellor CARL HAYDEN. Mr. Ross said that as of this week, he had had no response.</p>
