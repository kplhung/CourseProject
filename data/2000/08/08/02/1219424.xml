        <p>Their puppyish faces alone are enough to show that the students in ''American High'' are not actors. In television dramas the supposed teenagers (especially the boys) have the chiseled features of professional actors in their 20's, a fact conspicuous everywhere from ''Dawson's Creek'' to the summer series ''Young Americans.'' But in ''American High,'' the 14 seniors who were filmed throughout their last year of high school have the out-of-proportion features of adolescents. It's not baby fat we're seeing but the soft, unformed look of people who have not quite grown into their faces.</p>
        <p>That is only part of what makes this documentary series the least contrived and most realistic of reality programs. When camera crews weren't following the students, their self-made video diaries took over (the two forms blend fluently on screen). These middle-class suburban students, from Highland Park High outside Chicago, were not dealing with explosive issues of crime or survival but with the inner turmoil of working out relationships and getting into college. ''American High'' is serious, expertly crafted, often poignant, yet disappointingly predictable.</p>

        <p>Their puppyish faces alone are enough to show that the students in ''American High'' are not actors. In television dramas the supposed teenagers (especially the boys) have the chiseled features of professional actors in their 20's, a fact conspicuous everywhere from ''Dawson's Creek'' to the summer series ''Young Americans.'' But in ''American High,'' the 14 seniors who were filmed throughout their last year of high school have the out-of-proportion features of adolescents. It's not baby fat we're seeing but the soft, unformed look of people who have not quite grown into their faces.</p>
        <p>That is only part of what makes this documentary series the least contrived and most realistic of reality programs. When camera crews weren't following the students, their self-made video diaries took over (the two forms blend fluently on screen). These middle-class suburban students, from Highland Park High outside Chicago, were not dealing with explosive issues of crime or survival but with the inner turmoil of working out relationships and getting into college. ''American High'' is serious, expertly crafted, often poignant, yet disappointingly predictable.</p>
        <p>Its flatness may be the most illuminating aspect of all: on the realistic side, it demonstrates that we already know a lot about the inner lives of teenagers; on the dramatic side, it suggests how expectations have been shaped and inflated by movies and series targeted at teenagers and by other so-called reality shows.</p>
        <p>The series was made by R. J. Cutler, a producer of ''The War Room,''  about behind-the-scenes maneuvers in the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign, and a co-director of ''A Perfect Candidate,'' about Oliver L. North's campaign for the Senate. In theory the same pulling-back-the-curtain aspect should inform ''American High,'' but there is not much to surprise teenagers or their parents here.</p>
        <p>These students are self-aware and articulate as they confront their typical problems. Robby and Sarah have been dating for two years, and she is terrified of what will happen when he goes away to college. With a poignant mix of self-awareness and naivete, she says, ''I'm scared for myself 'cause I'm a kid still. I've just turned 17 and I've already found the love of my life.''</p>
        <p>In a couple of scenes she and Robby lie on a bed (fully clothed), in intimate yet hardly shocking moments. In this high school version of pillow talk, they discuss his going away. ''I'll have to teach you how to do laundry,'' she says.</p>
        <p>In the most dramatic scene, Robby's friend Brad reveals that he is gay. Robby is surprised, though quickly accepting. Brad is later seen at a group meeting for gay and lesbian students. These are not trivial issues, but in our confessional culture they are familiar.</p>
        <p>Morgan, the most outrageous of the students, begins the series with a rant to the camera (with one word bleeped out): ''These are the years when you're supposed to be wild, blame it all on your parents or society, not have to suffer consequences, have unprotected sex, go do drugs, smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol.'' His mother interrupts to tell him to quiet down, but he goes on: ''These are your teen years but what are you sitting at home having to do? Homework.''</p>
        <p>The raucous, attention-seeking opening does not truly set the series's tone. By the end of tonight's two back-to-back episodes, Morgan has gotten a part-time job helping to coach gymnastics for disabled young people. He thinks he may want to teach them as a career.</p>
        <p>No one would wish him to be more self-destructive, but it would have made a livelier story. That's what we have come to expect from both fiction and reality shows. ''Dawson's Creek'' has included an ex-convict, drug-dealing father; the entertaining ''Young Americans'' is even more melodramatic. (Now halfway through its eight-week summer run, it will be shown tonight at 9 on WB, directly competing against ''American High.'') The setting is an exclusive boys' school near a working-class New England town. In the first episode, the rich, handsome and preposterously named Scout Calhoun (Mark Famiglietti) falls for the local girl who works at the gas station, Bella Banks (Kate Bosworth), only to find that she is his father's illegitimate daughter. That puts a nasty crimp in the romance. As Scout's roommate wryly says, ''It's socially unacceptable to date your sister.''</p>
        <p>The Oedipal tangle makes the major subplot seem tame: a girl masquerades as a boy to enroll at Rawley Boys' Academy. ''Young Americans'' is fun in a soapy way, but it has struggled in the ratings. Maybe viewers want a bit more attachment to reality than this.</p>
        <p>But they don't want a lack of drama. MTV's flourishing ''Real World'' may feature real-life players, yet they are cast by the show's producers and placed in a situation -- living and working together -- contrived for maximum volatility. It's not quite the real world; it's reality enhanced.</p>
        <p>In this summer overloaded with shows that turn fake ''reality'' into a game, from the insanely popular physical challenges on ''Survivor'' to the already annoying mind games on ''Big Brother,'' ''American High'' is more genuine. But that is not enough to make it scintillating. The show may inadvertently point out that pseudorealism and explosive emotions are the kind of escapist entertainment viewers really want.</p>
        <p>AMERICAN HIGH  Fox, tonight at 9  (Channel 5 in New York)</p>
        <p>Created, produced and directed by R. J. Cutler. Dan Partland, supervising producer; Ted Skillman, coordinating producer. Produced by Actual Reality Pictures in association with 20th Century Fox Televison. Mr. Cutler, Erwin More, Brian Medavoy and Cheryl Stanley, executive producers.</p>
