        <p>Women who were physically or sexually abused in childhood show exaggerated physiological responses to stressful events, a new study has found. And this abnormal stress response, the researchers found, appears especially pronounced in women who also have symptoms of clinical depression.</p>
        <p>When exposed to mild stress induced in a laboratory setting, women in the study who suffered from depression and had a history of childhood abuse showed levels of ACTH, a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland in response to stress, six times as high as those in women without such histories. They also had higher levels of cortisol, another stress hormone, and higher heart rates than women who had not been abused. Women with a history of abuse who were not depressed also showed hypersensitivity to the stress, but to a less extreme degree.</p>
        <p>The study's findings offer further confirmation that traumatic experiences can have a profound effect on brain chemistry, and in particular on the brain's response to stress, and they add to the growing body of evidence that in exploring the origins of psychiatric illness, nature and nurture cannot be easily disentangled.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, here is an environmental event that causes changes in the brain and must interact with genetic vulnerability to influence whether or not you get this syndrome of hypersensitivity,'' said Dr. Charles B. Nemeroff, chairman of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine and a co-author of the study, which appears in today's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nemeroff said the research also underlined the importance of addressing child abuse nationally. More than three million cases of child abuse are reported each year, he said. ''And if, indeed, this is a risk factor for developing mood and anxiety disorders,'' he continued, ''this is a very large public health problem.''</p>
        <p>Women were used in the study, he said, because they are more likely to suffer from depression than men and are more frequently the victims of sexual abuse. But he said there was no inherent reason why men would not exhibit the same response.</p>
        <p>A history of childhood abuse, studies have shown, puts people at higher risk for developing depression, anxiety disorders and other emotional illnesses later in life. And abnormal stress responses, Dr. Nemeroff and his colleagues suggest, might to some degree account for this increased risk.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rachel Yehuda, professor of psychiatry and director of the Traumatic Stress Studies Program at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, said the new study's findings ''support observations that our group has made over a 10-year period about the exquisite responsiveness of stress hormones in survivors who have sustained trauma in both childhood and adulthood.''</p>
        <p>In a series of studies, Dr. Yehuda and her colleagues have documented abnormal stress responses in combat veterans, rape victims, survivors of the Holocaust and others who have endured traumatic experiences.</p>
        <p>Evidence from animal studies also suggests that extreme stress during early development might lay the groundwork for hypersensitivity to stressful events later in life.</p>
        <p>Adult rats separated from their mothers for a few hours each day soon after birth show exaggerated cortisol secretion in response to stress, researchers have found. And similar abnormal responses have been found in adult monkeys reared by their mothers under stressful conditions.</p>
        <p>For their study, Dr. Nemeroff and his colleagues recruited 49 women ages 18 to 45 as volunteers. Childhood abuse was defined, for the purposes of the study, as repeated, severe abuse occurring at least once a month for a period of at least one year.</p>
        <p>Independent verification that abuse had occurred was obtained, when possible, from court and medical records and the recollections of friends and family members.</p>
        <p>To induce mild stress, the participants in the study were asked to give a speech and solve arithmetic problems in front of an audience.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dennis Charney, chief of the research program on mood and anxiety disorders at the National Institute of Mental Health, said the new study and others like it illustrated  ''the proverbial gene-environment interaction.''</p>
        <p>''You are born with a certain genetic constitution to handle many things, including stress,'' Dr. Charney said. ''But if the developing animal or human is faced with an extraordinary amount of stress, those systems are going to be changed in how they develop.''</p>
