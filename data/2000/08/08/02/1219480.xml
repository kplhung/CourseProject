        <p>Often, Brad Maynard is not seen at Giants training camp as much as he is heard.</p>
        <p>The deep, reverberant thump of a well-struck punt will trumpet Maynard's presence on a distant field. Heads will turn to see a football boring through the sky above the tree line -- a perfect, arching spiral as if propelled by machine, not Maynard's size 10 foot.</p>
        <p>It has been a frequent sight and sound at training camp, which has been a place of revival for Maynard after an indifferent season a year ago. Maynard is having his best camp in four years because of a change in coaching philosophy.</p>
        <p>Last year, the Giants emphasized directional punting -- attempting to place most punts not only 45 yards downfield but in a particular area of the field. Maynard had the ability to position his punts, but too often it cost him distance and hang time.</p>
        <p>''It became too much of a finesse thing last year,'' Maynard said today. ''I was aiming the ball instead of just letting my leg get through it. I don't know if it's our stadium or the wind, or it became just a confidence thing, but it wasn't working for me.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, Maynard nearly had a Pro Bowl season, with a 45.2-yard gross average that was second in the National Football Conference. His net average of 37.8 was sixth in the N.F.C. and his 33 punts downed inside the 20-yard line were second-best in the league.</p>
        <p>The Giants, with an struggling offense that needed good field position to score, had begun to view Maynard as their best bet for field position -- an invaluable asset to the offense and the defense, which liked to attack when the opposition was pinned deep in its own territory.</p>
        <p>Then came 1999. Maynard was a star of the Giants season-opening victory at Tampa Bay, punting 12 times for a 43.7 average with six punts inside the 20-yard line. Most of the rest of Maynard's season, however, was subpar. He finished with a career low 41-yard gross average and a net average of 35.1.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, this winter the Giants re-examined how they were using Maynard.</p>
        <p>''We decided to try to get Brad to do the things he does best,'' Giants special-teams coach, Larry Mac Duff, said. ''And that's distance and hang time. He demonstrated he can be a capable weapon and we'll still work on pooch kicking the ball to the corners near the end zone, but sometimes by trying to place the ball you may lose some hang time.</p>
        <p>''Right now, we told him to get his hang time in the 4.6 or 5.0 second range and to let it rip.''</p>
        <p>Those are words that the 26-year-old Maynard, a highly flexible, almost instinctive punter, longed to hear.</p>
        <p>''I love it,'' he said. ''The only worry is getting it up in the air and down the field.''</p>
        <p>Maynard has been doing plenty of both in training camp so far, with booming kicks that send return men back-pedaling.</p>
        <p>''I know Mike Horan was good at the directional punting,'' Maynard said, referring to his predecessor with the Giants under Dan Reeves. ''For whatever reason, I wasn't. But I feel comfortable again, and if they want me to place a punt or two, maybe it'll come more naturally.</p>
        <p>''Right now, this is better for me. I'd rather sky a punt.''</p>
        <p>It is in the soundtrack at Giants camp, the sky is the target.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Defensive end MICHAEL STRAHAN missed his fourth consecutive day of practice because of tightness in his back. Strahan, who was examined by a back specialist and a chiropractor in Manhattan Monday, visited a chiropractor in Albany Tuesday. JIM FASSEL reiterated that Strahan's back was not a serious problem though he conceded that Strahan would not play in Saturday's preseason game against the Chicago Bears unless Strahan resumes practicing Wednesday. . . . Fassel also said the joint practice scheduled for Aug. 8 between the Giants and the Jets might be canceled. The timing of the joint practice -- three days after playing the Bears and three days before going to play in Jacksonville, Fla. -- concerns the Giants, who continue to put a priority on staying injury-free. . . . Giants defensive tackle KEITH HAMILTON left practice with a hamstring strain that Fassel said was not serious. . . . In the end of practice sprints known as gassers, running back RON DAYNE continues to lag far behind the rest of the backs in the group. Fassel said he is not concerned and has even joked about it. ''Everyone is different,'' Fassel said. ''I knew he wasn't going to be the sprint champion when we were running gassers.''</p>
