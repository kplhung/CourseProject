        <p>Even as casual drug use has dropped nationwide, some of the nation's most prominent drug experts warned today that the use of a psychedelic drug known as Ecstasy has risen sharply, particularly among young people, raising fears that a major new front has opened in the government's efforts to curb illegal drugs.</p>
        <p>In the last 10 months alone, agents for the Customs Service have seized a record 8 million doses of the drug at the nation's airports and other ports of entry, far exceeding the 750,000 doses or tablets seized in 1998 and the 3.5 million confiscated last year, according to the government.</p>

        <p>Even as casual drug use has dropped nationwide, some of the nation's most prominent drug experts warned today that the use of a psychedelic drug known as Ecstasy has risen sharply, particularly among young people, raising fears that a major new front has opened in the government's efforts to curb illegal drugs.</p>
        <p>In the last 10 months alone, agents for the Customs Service have seized a record 8 million doses of the drug at the nation's airports and other ports of entry, far exceeding the 750,000 doses or tablets seized in 1998 and the 3.5 million confiscated last year, according to the government.</p>
        <p>But federal officials gathered at a conference here to discuss how to deal with the drug acknowledge that the seizures represent only a fraction of the total amount of Ecstasy that has been smuggled into the country and, in turn, channeled into major cities like New York, Los Angeles and Miami.</p>
        <p>Officials say the drug, which increases energy and is reputed to foster a sense of well-being, has gained popularity among teenagers on the nightclub circuit and at all-night dance parties known as raves.</p>
        <p>The proliferation of the so-called club drug has been fueled by highly organized drug traffickers who authorities say have begun to expand their sales operations into the increasingly lucrative Ecstasy market, where a single pill can be manufactured for as little as 50 cents and then sold for as much as $40.</p>
        <p>''What was once ad-hoc smuggling among small-time dealers and users has mushroomed into organized trafficking among criminals,'' said Raymond W. Kelly, the commissioner of the Customs Service. ''They have the money and the muscle to market Ecstasy beyond the club scene in New York, Miami and Los Angeles. We now see it surfacing all over the country.''</p>
        <p>The seizures, along with evidence of the drug's increasing use, have prompted such widespread concern that law enforcement officials and drug policy experts from across the country have gathered this week in Washington at a conference organized by the Drug Enforcement Administration to discuss strategies on combating it.</p>
        <p>The White House's drug policy director, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, today warned that the drug was posing a particularly serious threat to children. He cited a nationally recognized survey showing a sharp rise in the number of high school seniors who said that they had used Ecstasy in the previous month, from 1.5 percent in 1998 to 2.5 percent the following year.</p>
        <p>''The use of Ecstasy has skyrocketed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For all the concerns raised, law enforcement officials at the conference and elsewhere seemed at a loss over how to confront the problem. General McCaffrey said today that his office would spend $5 million on a national advertising campaign warning against the drug. But he offered no other major initiatives specifically tailored to deal with the Ecstasy problem.</p>
        <p>In what was described today as a victory in the government's war against drug traffickers, Attorney General Janet Reno announced the arrest of 140 people who were accused of participating in a nationwide ring that supplied clandestine methamphetamine laboratories with the basic ingredient needed to make the drug. The arrests capped an eight-month investigation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno, who made the announcement at the Ecstasy drug conference, said that federal agents had seized 10 tons of pseudoephedrine, a compound found in diet pills and nasal decongestants, but which bootleggers use to make methamphetamines, a stimulant nicknamed meth, crank, ice and speed.</p>
        <p>Ecstasy is a bitter white powder that is also known as MDMA, short for methylenedioxy methamphetamine. It is a chemical variation of mescaline, a hallucinogenic drug obtained from the mescal plant, and amphetamine, or speed, a drug that stimulates the central nervous system.</p>
        <p>It enjoyed a brief period of popularity in the early 1970's as a substitute for methylenedioxy amphetamine, or MDA, which was outlawed in the late 1960's. But it was not until the early to mid-1980's that Ecstasy gained a regular following in both Europe and the United States on the nightclub and party scene.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the drug's popularity has grown at a rate that has alarmed authorities in the United States, though it is difficult to say exactly how many people are experimenting with the drug. It has become one of the illicit drugs that law enforcement officials consider the most troubling because of their widespread use.</p>
        <p>Many users of Ecstasy are drawn by its ability to reduce inhibitions, promote euphoria, produce light hallucinations and suppress the need to eat or sleep. One pill's effects can last as much as six hours, but users build up a tolerance, and an overdose can cause accelerated heartbeat, high blood pressure, fainting, muscle cramps or panic attacks.</p>
        <p>Many experts consider Ecstasy psychologically addictive and maintain that it can cause paranoia and psychosis. It has been linked to a handful of deaths nationwide in recent years, along with a spate of injuries. The government reports that 1,042 people sought emergency-room help in 1998, compared with 637 people a year earlier because they had abused the drug.</p>
        <p>The drug is largely manufactured in laboratories in Belgium and the Netherlands, where it is sold for as little as 50 cents, and then smuggled into the United States. For the most part, Israeli organized-crime syndicates have been implicated as the main source of the distribution of the drugs in the United States, the authorities say.</p>
        <p>But Lewis Rice Jr., the special agent who heads the drug agency's New York division, said the potential for large profits has led other drug organizations to enter into the Ecstasy trade.</p>
        <p>''In the decade of the 1990's, we didn't see that much of this drug,'' he said. ''But traditional cocaine organizations are starting to look at Ecstasy as the new drug to market and sell.''</p>
