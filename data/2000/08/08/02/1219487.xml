        <p>In an expensive bid to re-establish itself as the top retailer in its field, Toys ''R'' Us announced yesterday that it would open the world's largest toy store amid the tourist-choked streets and neon-infused ballyhoo of Times Square.</p>
        <p>The glass-enclosed, 101,000-square-foot superstore at the northeast corner of Broadway and 44th Street will feature a 60-foot-tall indoor Ferris wheel offering customers panoramic views of the stuffed toys, action figures, dolls, science kits and electronic games available on three floors, the company said.</p>

        <p>In an expensive bid to re-establish itself as the top retailer in its field, Toys ''R'' Us announced yesterday that it would open the world's largest toy store amid the tourist-choked streets and neon-infused ballyhoo of Times Square.</p>
        <p>The glass-enclosed, 101,000-square-foot superstore at the northeast corner of Broadway and 44th Street will feature a 60-foot-tall indoor Ferris wheel offering customers panoramic views of the stuffed toys, action figures, dolls, science kits and electronic games available on three floors, the company said.</p>
        <p>Real estate executives who have seen the company's plans said Toys ''R'' Us would spend about $35 million to build the store, which will sit opposite the MTV music studios and ABC-TV's studios for ''Good Morning America.'' They said the company would pay about $12 million a year in rent for the store and the animated video screens and billboards overhead.</p>
        <p>It would be not only the largest toy store in the world, but also the largest retail outlet in Times Square, one-third larger than the Virgin Megastore one block to the north. The company is hoping that the flagship store, scheduled to open next summer, will be so dazzling and media friendly that toy manufacturers will flock to the site to unveil new products, much the same way music groups introduce new songs at the MTV studios.</p>
        <p>''It'll be the center of the toy universe,'' John Eyler, chief executive of Toys ''R'' Us, said yesterday. ''We expect to draw over 20 million visitors a year.''</p>
        <p>Several executives in Times Square said that Toys ''R'' Us planned to close its labyrinthine, 90,000-square-foot store 10 blocks south in Herald Square, although Susan McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the company, said, ''We have no plans to do it at this time.''</p>
        <p>The company described the new flagship as one step in the company's campaign to regain its position as the No. 1 toy retailer, which it lost to Wal-Mart two years ago, and to develop the same kind of cachet as its smaller but more upscale rival, F.A.O. Schwarz.</p>
        <p>It could be an expensive gamble, some retail experts said. Theme restaurants, entertainment centers and movie theaters have moved to Times Square in recent years. But many traditional retailers have been put off by the enormous rents, as much as $300 a square foot on the ground floor, more than twice as much as in many other areas of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Both the Gap and the Virgin Megastore moved to Times Square well before the once-dowdy area rebounded in the late 90's and rents skyrocketed. But more recently, Old Navy spent many months hopping from landlord to landlord in search of what it thought was a reasonable deal. When the retailer finally found space on Broadway, ABC-TV grabbed it at the last moment with a higher offer. ABC ultimately paid about seven times Virgin Megastore's $1.2 million a year rent, according to real estate brokers.</p>
        <p>''Old Navy finally gave up on Times Square,'' said Robert Futterman, a broker who worked with the clothing chain. ''God forbid, they needed to make money after paying the rent.''</p>
        <p>Still, will customers brave streets crammed with tourists, teenage music fans, office workers and theatergoers to buy toys? ''With all that's going on in Times Square, I think they'll do well there,'' said Jeffrey Winnick, a retail consultant. ''People are buying records, Warner Brothers and Disney products. Why not toys? They'll have foot traffic and it'll be great P.R. for them.''</p>
        <p>Retail analysts like Melissa Williams of Gerard Klauer Mattison were generally intrigued by the toy retailer's concept of using a splashy storefront as a marketing vehicle, but she said she did not think it was the key to the company's future.</p>
        <p>The company, which runs 1,553 stores, has lost ground in recent years to giant discount stores like Wal-Mart that cut prices on toys during the holiday season to attract customers who might also buy other products. ''A flagship store in a major city can be useful for establishing a higher profile, while hopefully driving sales and making money,'' said Sally Wallick, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker. ''But it's one store. What really matters is what happens during the holidays in the rest of the stores.''</p>
        <p>Toys ''R'' Us is redesigning its stores and raising pay for employees in an effort to overcome the company's reputation as a messy warehouse with poor service. Mr. Eyler, the former chairman of F.A.O. Schwarz, has also focused on developing merchandise sold exclusively at Toys ''R'' Us at higher margins, like Animal Planet toys and Nickelodeon boutiques. In May, profits at the company were up for the first time in two years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eyler, who joined Toys ''R'' Us as chief executive in January,  said he had been seeking a flagship location in Times Square, but it was hard to find a large enough space. Brad Mendelson, a broker with Insignia/ESG, eventually took the company to 1514 Broadway, the former home of the Roundabout Theater, which offered big floors with 38-foot ceilings and few columns.</p>
        <p>''It means we can do things three-dimensionally,'' said Mr. Eyler, who plans to include a cafe in the store.</p>
        <p>The deal represents something of a victory for the owner of the building, Charles B. Moss Jr., who rejected a $92 million deal two years ago to allow Random House to build an office tower over his storefronts. Many people thought he had made a big mistake, but Mr. Moss figured that the support columns for the tower would knock out too much of his prized retail space. He has since signed lucrative contracts for billboards and rented the Toys ''R'' Us space. Two executives active in Times Square said that Mr. Moss was about to close a deal with Sephora, the cosmetics chain, for much of the remaining space.</p>
