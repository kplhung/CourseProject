        <p>Whither Mortimer's? The question of what will happen to the space at 1057 Lexington Avenue (75th Street) has been debated since Glenn Bernbaum, the owner of the restaurant, which was favored by socialites, died in 1998.</p>

        <p>In Place of Mortimer's</p>
        <p>Whither Mortimer's? The question of what will happen to the space at 1057 Lexington Avenue (75th Street) has been debated since Glenn Bernbaum, the owner of the restaurant, which was favored by socialites, died in 1998.</p>
        <p>The ladies who lunch moved on, but Jean Denoyer and his partners in La Goulue, Francois Latapie and Regis Marnier, bought the building for $5.1 million and have spent at least that much to renovate and rebuild it. Their new restaurant, Orsay, is to open there on Friday.</p>
        <p>Forget Mortimer's famous meatloaf. Orsay's chef, Philippe Schmit, also from La Goulue, plans updated French fare to go with the 140-seat room's Art Nouveau decor, much of it imported from France. A second-floor private party room and an outdoor cafe will open later.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare Eats Here</p>
        <p>The Muse Hotel, opening later this month at 130 West 46th Street, will have a restaurant with a theater theme that is being designed by David Rockwell. It will be run by Gino Diaferia, an owner of Veritas and Indigo. Sam DeMarco, the chef and owner of First in the East Village, whose style is eclectic American, is to be the chef and a partner.</p>
        <p>Dutch-Designed Food</p>
        <p>Inez Bon has taken over the space at 169 Sullivan Street (Houston Street), which was Caffe Lure, and is planning to open NL (for Netherlands) in the fall as a showcase for modern Dutch food and design.</p>
        <p>Forget wooden shoes, windmills and spheres of Edam. Ms. Bon, who owns Morlang, a restaurant in Amsterdam, has hired Dutch designers to create a sleekly modern restaurant, and Dutch chefs to plan traditional dishes like smoked eel and pea soup, to vie for attention with Indonesian rijsttafel and nasi goreng, which reflect Dutch colonial history.</p>
