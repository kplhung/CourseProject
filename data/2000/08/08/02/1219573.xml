        <p>Rod Thorn's voice was hoarse from all the talking yesterday, but there were no handshakes and no signatures at the Nets Champion Center in New Jersey on the first day of the free-agent signing period.</p>
        <p>''No wet ink,'' Thorn, the Nets' president, said with a laugh.</p>
        <p>After being turned down by the league Monday for the two injury exceptions, worth roughly $7.7 million, Thorn and the Nets now have to search for a player who will sign for the $2.25 million mid-level exception they do have.</p>
        <p>The Nets are still in discussions to re-sign Kendall Gill, and while they have floated a number -- less than the $5.6 million he made last year, and roughly in the $4 million range -- there has been no formal offer.</p>
        <p>''We've been waiting to hear back from them,'' Gill's agent, Arn Tellem, said. ''We've talked about a number, and we've communicated what we've liked to do. We're open to anything. All I can say is that Kendall is hoping to stay, but the ball is in their court right now.</p>
        <p>''I think New Jersey not getting the exceptions will make them focus on Kendall in this next week,'' Tellem said.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the Nets will also consider resigning its own free agent, Johnny Newman, to a one-year deal. While there are few shooting guards available, New Jersey could turn its attention to finding a backup at small forward or center with its mid-level exception.</p>
        <p>The Nets named Sidney Levy director of marketing.</p>
