        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Tales of Raw Misery for Ages 12 and Up'' (Week in Review, July 30):</p>
        <p>When you wrote that young-adult fiction has moved into bleak territory, I felt a jolt of recognition. In fact, children's literature reads like young-adult fare.</p>
        <p>My daughter completed fourth grade in June. In her classes she was treated to stories of children ripped from poor families, girls hounded for being suspected as witches, girls sent to live with intolerant relatives, girls who were bullied or excluded, and families without mothers, fathers or money.</p>
        <p>Current themes are as morose as peasant life in feudal England -- unending sorrow punctuated by flashes of life-threatening danger.  My 10-year-old sees peril around every corner.</p>
        <p>I don't wish to sidestep the reality of so many children's lives, but I do believe that we need to hold out happiness as an option.</p>
        <p>Aren't we as a society capable of committed marriages, with children enjoying safe and fulfilling lives? Shouldn't children aspire to that goal? We need literature modeling the steps necessary to achieve happy lives.</p>
