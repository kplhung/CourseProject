        <p>* Pay for 20 weeks of tutoring for a child who can't read.</p>
        <p>* Send four kids to summer camp.</p>
        <p>* Sign up a team of 10-year-olds for indoor basketball for the whole winter.</p>
        <p>* Give a child a year and a half of piano lessons.</p>
        <p>* Throw 12 kids their very own bowling and pizza birthday party for 10 friends.</p>
        <p>* Buy a whole class of schoolchildren new sneakers.</p>
        <p>* Buy 78 children a copy of the new Harry Potter book.</p>
        <p>* Take 500 kids out for tacos with rice and guacamole.</p>
        <p>* Treat 1,000 sweaty children to an ice cream on a hot summer night.</p>
