        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak's political problems deepened today as his right-wing opponents, sensing blood with their stunning defeat of Shimon Peres, his presidential candidate, vowed new efforts to bring down his government.</p>
        <p>''Barak doesn't have a government,'' declared the Likud Party leader, Ariel Sharon, calling for new elections. ''He has lost his majority in the Knesset.''</p>
        <p>And during the swearing-in of the first Likud candidate ever elected president -- Moshe Katsav, a low-profile politician and Sephardic immigrant from Iran whose chances had been discounted by commentators -- there was turmoil and consternation within the remnants of Mr. Barak's battered coalition.</p>
        <p>Even one of Mr. Barak's closest associates, Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh, a comrade from his days in Israel's most elite secret commando unit, issued a frustrated call for new elections.</p>
        <p>''If, in the current political makeup of the Knesset, we could not bring about the election of Peres,'' Mr. Sneh said on Israel radio, ''it is a sign that we will be unable to pass other things. Therefore, we must go directly to the nation, to present our path, so that the nation can decide what it wants.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak is expected get through one more rancorous session of the Parliament, or Knesset, on Wednesday before it adjourns for its regular three-month vacation. There is a bill calling for the Legislature's dissolution and new elections, but it is to be referred to a committee his party controls, which will bottle it up. Mr. Barak hopes to use this time to gain some advance in the peace process to strengthen his coalition, which now numbers only 42 in the 120-seat Legislature.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sharon warned today that what he called his Jerusalem Coalition would be ready to act should Mr. Barak ''sneak'' into any agreements.</p>
        <p>''We will stand on guard,'' said Mr. Sharon, a former general who is a hero of tank battles in the Sinai Desert in two wars and the architect of Israel's troubled 1982 invasion of Lebanon. ''We can call the Knesset at any time.''</p>
        <p>Although it would be unusual, the Parliament could be called back from vacation on a petition signed by 25 members, a number easily reachable for Likud and its allies. If the subject was a vote of no confidence, the petition would need 61 signatures, an absolute majority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon made his remarks before a group of foreign journalists, emphasizing repeatedly that Jerusalem was the rightful possession of the Jewish people and must never be divided in any way.</p>
        <p>''Jerusalem is a symbol that kept the Jews together for thousands of years,'' he thundered at one point, hammering his hand on the lectern. ''Jerusalem is a symbol. You don't touch it.''</p>
        <p>Political commentators, many of them critical of the vote against Mr. Peres in the Parliament and the role of the ultra-Orthodox parties in his defeat, were unanimous today in describing it as a major blow to Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>''The majority in the Knesset voted not only against Shimon Peres but first and foremost against Barak and against what the two of them represent,'' Nahum Barnea wrote in Yediot Ahronot. ''It is no wonder that the left wing in Israel let out a painful cry yesterday: beyond the sorrow at Peres's bad luck, people were afflicted by the same sense of self-pity that seized them after Rabin's assassination.'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995.</p>
        <p>Sima Kadmon wrote in the same newspaper: ''The Likud chalked up a tremendous political achievement yesterday. It succeeded where failure appeared certain. And that success is going to accelerate the collapse of Barak's coalition.''</p>
        <p>And in Maariv, Hami Shalev wrote: ''This is a Knesset which acts in ways that are not only confrontational but also somewhat perverse. This is a Knesset that will not pass a peace accord with the Palestinians, that will not legislate a referendum under conditions acceptable to the government, that will not let Barak move another meter.''</p>
