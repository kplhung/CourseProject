        <p>P.&amp; G. Meets Lowered Estimates  Procter &amp; Gamble, troubled by rising costs, management turmoil and credibility problems on Wall Street, reported fourth-quarter results that were in line with lowered forecasts but said that earnings growth in the first half of its new fiscal year would be sluggish.

        <p>Ex-Coke Manager Gives Suit Advice  A former Coca-Cola benefits manager who has criticized the company's treatment of black workers said that he would urge those workers to retain lawyers to help them determine whether they should accept a settlement reached in June between Coke and four black employees or file their own suits.

        <p>Three Labels to Sell Music Online  In a potentially fundamental change to the way music has been packaged, at least three major record labels -- EMI, Universal and Sony -- plan to begin selling songs over the Internet by the end of the year, enabling users to listen to or download songs for a flat fee.

        <p>Sales Offset Payouts on Air Delays  Hal Rosenbluth, whose travel management company offered in May to pay cash refunds to customers whose flights were delayed, has paid out more than he expected during this summer of delays and cancellations.
