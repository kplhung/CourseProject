        <p>Is everybody at CBS happy to finally have a breakthrough hit like ''Survivor?''</p>
        <p>Not if you include David Letterman, apparently.</p>
        <p>Mr. Letterman expressed a bit of unhappiness on the air on Monday night during some joking cross-talk with his band leader, Paul Shaffer, suggesting that CBS was not helping ''the whole CBS family'' as much as it could with ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Shaffer asked several times what he meant, Mr. Letterman was not specific but did agree that his discontent had something to do with the show's scheduling.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Letterman has called some CBS executives in Hollywood wondering -- in what one executive called a mostly humorous way -- if perhaps the hit show might be moved to a place that would prove more advantageous to his ''Late Show,'' say 9 p.m. or 10 p.m, instead of 8.</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' has set ratings records this summer, reaching close to 30 million people on Wednesday nights from 8 to 9, including more young adult viewers than any other show on CBS by a huge margin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Letterman has long suffered from not being able to promote his show to many young adult viewers because so few of them watch CBS, and his producers have long pointed out that he is at a distinct disadvantage against his main rival, Jay Leno at NBC because of CBS's 10 o'clock weeknight shows.</p>
        <p>NBC has ''E.R.'' and two editions of ''Law and Order,'' while CBS has ''Judging Amy'' as its only real 10 p.m. hit.</p>
        <p>The problem with ''Survivor,'' from Mr. Letterman's point of view, is that many of the viewers it has been attracting in droves have drifted away from CBS by 11 p.m. On several nights Mr. Letterman made a particular comic target of ''Falcone,'' which CBS was using at 10 p.m for a while, for driving away the remnants of that big ''Survivor'' audience.</p>
        <p>Maria Pope, the show's executive producer, said yesterday, ''We have not asked formally that the show be moved to 9 p.m.,'' though she acknowledged that she had ''made a pitch for 'Survivor II' to be moved to 9.'' She said, ''I don't know if Dave has called himself about it.''</p>
        <p>CBS plans a second round of castaway adventures -- this time in the Australian outback -- to start in January. The network has not committed itself to a time period for ''Survivor II,'' but yesterday Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, said, ''It could definitely go at 9 next time.''</p>
        <p>He ruled out starting the show at 10 because it has a significant audience of children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moonves noted that the ratings for ''Survivor'' had always been bigger from 8:30 to 9 than from 8 to 8:30, suggesting that the show might be even a bigger hit if it started at 9 p.m., when more viewers overall are available to watch television.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Moonves pointed out that ''Survivor'' had already helped Mr. Letterman considerably. ''We had our biggest Wednesday night in months for Dave last week,'' he said. On that occasion CBS followed ''Survivor'' with its other summer reality show, ''Big Brother,'' and far more of the audience was carried over.</p>
        <p>That Letterman show scored a 4.3 overnight rating, well above the 3.6 the show is averaging for the summer. For the weeks since ''Survivor'' started, Mr. Letterman is up about 25 percent in total viewers over the comparable weeks last year, to about 4.35 million from about 3.5 million.</p>
        <p>''Honestly we're delighted that 'Survivor' is on CBS,'' Ms. Pope said. ''I wish we had more shows like that.'' She acknowledged that promotions for Mr. Letterman's show run regularly on 'Survivor' and ''it's very helpful to reach that young audience.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Pope said that the Letterman team was looking forward to the night of the finale of ''Survivor'' on Aug. 23, which CBS has turned into a three-hour ''Survivor'' extravaganza: two hours to settle which contestant wins the $1 million prize followed by an hourlong ''town meeting'' with  the 16 original participants.</p>
        <p>That will lead directly into the local newscasts and then to Mr. Letterman.</p>
