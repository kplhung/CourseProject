        <p>After four days of subtle digs at President Clinton, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas took him on directly today and said the president was ''so desperate to have his legacy intact by getting Al Gore elected, he'll say anything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's remarks on his campaign plane came as he stopped in two more battleground states -- West Virginia and Pennsylvania -- on his way to a triumphant coronation at the Republican convention.</p>
        <p>The Texas governor was prompted by a stream of broadsides from Mr. Clinton, who said at a recent Democratic fund-raiser that Mr. Bush's message amounted to ''How bad could I be? I've been governor of Texas. My daddy was president. I own a baseball team. They like me down there.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Bush said he welcomed the jabs. ''It's amazing to me that the president of the United States would spend time trying to be a political pundit,'' he said. ''He's so desperate to have his legacy intact by getting Al Gore elected, he'll say anything, just like Al Gore will. And I welcome him to the arena.''</p>
        <p>Later, at his first rally of the day at the West Virginia war memorial at the foot of the State Capitol, Mr. Bush stepped up his criticism.</p>
        <p>''We're going to win the state of West Virginia,'' he told a crowd of several thousand people, ''and we're going to do so because this nation is sick and tired of the politics of personal destruction.'' He added, ''This nation is looking for an administration that will appeal to our better angels, not our darker impulses. This nation does not want four more years of Clinton-Gore.''</p>
        <p>It was the first time in days that he had mentioned the two Democrats by name in a speech; until now he had made only implicit shots at President Clinton for his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky and his evasions about it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's wife, Laura, made a similar dig on Monday in her convention speech about education when she that said her husband hears pleas from people to bring back an era when children can ''respect the president of the United States.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said they were simply reflecting public sentiment. ''When people walk up and say 'don't let us down,' we're just reporting what's happening,'' he said. ''I don't think I've ever mentioned President Clinton's name on the stump recently.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether he was talking about Mr. Clinton when he called his running mate, Dick Cheney, a man ''who knows what the meaning of is is,'' Mr. Bush said, ''Yeah. I was talking about him then. I sure was. But in the context of having somebody who's going to shoot straight with the American people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's rally in West Virginia was followed by one in Harrisburg late this afternoon, as he completed a trip through six swing states and prepared to make his entrance in Philadelphia on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Like all the crowds Mr. Bush has drawn during the last five days, the ones today were overwhelmingly white, despite the choreography of the convention, which has been featuring minority speakers to moderate the party's image and to appeal to suburban voters. The largest group of blacks to appear at any of Mr. Bush's rallies were union members who staged a protest against him on Thursday in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Asked if the lack of diversity showed that his appeals were not resonating with minority voters, Mr. Bush said, ''We'll see on Election Day.'' He added: ''I can't remember the makeup of the crowds in Texas, but I got nearly 50 percent of the Hispanic vote, and I'm not so sure the nature of the crowd necessarily reflects the nature of the vote.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush praised retired Gen. Colin L. Powell for his challenge to  Republicans on Monday to reach out to black voters and ''not just during an election-year campaign.''</p>
        <p>Asked about Mr. Powell's criticism that some in the party condemn affirmative action to help ''black kids get an education'' but not ''affirmative action'' for lobbyists, Mr. Bush sidestepped the issue.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what specific policies he had in mind,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Children not getting into places of higher education? In my state of Texas we took a very positive step toward ensuring the racial mix of Texas universities reflected the nature of our population.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was referring to legislation he signed in Texas after a court threw out an affirmative action plan for higher education. The law guarantees that the top 10 percent of graduates from every high school in the state will be ensured a place in a Texas college or university.</p>
