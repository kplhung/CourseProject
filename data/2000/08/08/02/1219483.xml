        <p>Twelve years ago, Merrill Lynch chose 251 first graders at random from some of the toughest neighborhoods in 10 cities and made them a pledge: graduate from high school by 2000, and we will pay all your college expenses.</p>
        <p>The company saw the pledge as the kind of transaction a financial services firm understood: investing money. It would be pretty straightforward: throw a few community events, collect report cards from the schools and send out the checks.</p>
        <p>It quickly became apparent that it was not that easy. Getting the students through school took more hours and people than anyone predicted. Not least, it took the dedication of students and families. But now, as the deadline arrives, the Merrill Lynch program, ScholarshipBuilder, stands out as the longest and one of the most successful programs, with 93 percent of students -- not counting two who died -- heading to college in the fall.</p>
        <p>Following celebrations in the 10 cities -- from Boston to Miami and Los Angeles -- 149 of the students gathered in New York City this week to meet one another for the first time and to collect some last-minute advice on how to make the transition to college. Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, was reflecting on the major lesson of any program of its kind: it's about much more than money.</p>
        <p>''A full scholarship was a big deal,'' said Eddy Bayardelle, director of the company's philanthropic programs. ''But for urban kids it's not good enough. Not when you're starting in the first grade. So many things will happen in 12 years.''</p>
        <p>ScholarshipBuilder, which its founders estimated will have cost $16 million at the program's end, came on the heels of other programs started by philanthropists, universities and companies in the 1980's as dropout rates soared.</p>
        <p>But while others held out the financial carrot to sixth graders -- along the model established by the New York philanthropist Eugene M. Lang in a speech to his former Harlem elementary school in 1981 -- Merrill Lynch started earlier. It invested $2,000 in accounts for each pupil every year through 12th grade, and enlisted the Urban League to be the more human side of the program, offering mentors and after-school programs.</p>
        <p>Looking back, the students say they did not understand what was happening to them. They remember they were given bright yellow book bags and a letter announcing the gift. ''I remember we had an assembly, we all had to stand on the stage and wave our letters, look cute for the cameras,'' said Nicole Brown, 18, who was chosen at P.S. 30/31 in Harlem. She will head to Howard University next month. But in first grade, she and others were not sure they would go to college.</p>
        <p>''A lot of celebrities don't graduate from high school,'' she said, ''I thought maybe it didn't matter.''</p>
        <p>Some began to realize the benefit in middle school, as people they knew started to go to college.</p>
        <p>''When you find out how much school costs, and your mother doesn't make that much in a year, you know it's a blessing,'' said Travis McKinnon, 17, a recipient from Detroit.</p>
        <p>But most said they did not realize what they had been given until high school -- and often, not until they had risked losing it.</p>
        <p>''Realizing that if you don't graduate in 2000 you don't get the full scholarship, that makes you get your grades up fast,'' said Ashley Lightbourne, another of the Harlem students.</p>
        <p>Merrill Lynch always planned to offer tutoring, and that continued throughout. But the needs grew as students got older. Simply tracking students as they moved between family members and foster parents proved a huge challenge. By sixth grade, Merrill Lynch decided to hire full-time coordinators for each city to help the students and their families. Those people became like parents in some cases, going to teacher conferences, finding medical help, arranging summer camps. One ScholarshipBuilder student drowned; another committed suicide.</p>
        <p>Merrill Lynch found jobs for some parents, helped siblings with tutoring, and took the students on college tours as senior year approached. In each city, the Urban League arranged a place for students to go after school, where they could bring homework or see friends. When one girl in Detroit moved out of town, Chris Gaitley, the assistant to a Merrill Lynch district director, phoned different cab companies until she found one that would be willing to drive the girl back and forth to the center for her tutoring each day.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gaitley was involved from the inception of the program, working with the students despite the demands placed on her by her own three children. ''I never felt I had a choice not to,'' she explained.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bayardelle said starting in the first grade was crucial to the program's success. But programs that started in the sixth grade have seen more dropouts, more deaths from gang violence, and slower high school completion rates.</p>
        <p>Each student left New York this week with a laptop computer from Merrill Lynch, which will allow them to keep in e-mail contact with their mentors and fellow students.</p>
        <p>The program organizers, while contemplating what Merrill Lynch's next educational venture might be, are recruiting mentors from within the company to advise the students as they go through the next four years. That, too, was an addition to  the original program. But Mr. Bayardelle said it would be irresponsible to leave the students at this stage.</p>
        <p>''We've learned a lot over the last 12 years,'' he said. ''There's no magic to this, but there's a lot, a lot of caring, by a lot of caring adults.''</p>
