        <p>There is a new fraternity growing within the clannish New York Police Department, but most of its members are so ashamed by what they share that they have never met and do not even know one another's names.</p>
        <p>The reason is that all of them have the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
        <p>To their fellow officers, they are indistinguishable from the rest of the 40,000 men and women who police New York City, but in their own minds, AIDS has set them a world apart. For many, it weighs them down not only with the fear of death, but also with a secret they are desperate to keep from their fellow officers.</p>
        <p>They are afraid, they say, that they will be banished from the wider police fraternity in which most of them came of age, a sort of blue reservoir of strength that they are used to turning to for solace. They cannot imagine telling their colleagues they have a disease that many officers believe is an affliction only of gay men, drug addicts, prostitutes and the homeless.</p>
        <p>''The fear is that they would isolate you and cast you aside and say they don't want to work with you,'' said an officer who tested positive a year ago and has since watched with sadness as fellow officers, even her friends, have treated H.I.V.-positive prisoners with derision. ''A lot of cops are very ignorant. I wish the people I work with could know, but I just don't think they would understand.''</p>
        <p>The H.I.V.-positive officers are as disparate a group as any cross-section of New Yorkers. They include a middle-aged white man who lives in the suburbs with his wife and children, who said he tested positive for the virus after being bitten by an infected suspect; a Hispanic single mother of two, who said she caught the disease from her former husband, also a police officer; and a young black man who is openly gay and says he is unsure how he contracted the virus.</p>
        <p>Many private companies, arts organizations and even professional sports teams have been forced to deal with AIDS in the workplace over the last 20 years. Police departments are no different. Police officials in Chicago and Los Angeles, for example, say that AIDS has not been an issue within their forces and that officers who are infected with H.I.V. or who have AIDS are treated like any other officer with a serious illness.</p>
        <p>In New York City, officers who test positive for H.I.V. can turn to the  department's Early Intervention program for counseling and referrals, and to a police union group called the Members' Assistance Program.</p>
        <p>Many are referred to a man who has become the department's unofficial AIDS counselor, Stephen P. Yurcik, a retired officer who tested positive in 1990 and saw his wife, also a New York police officer, die from the disease two years later. Mr. Yurcik, who retired from the force in 1996, said he had the strong backing of both the department and the police union for his group, Positive Police.</p>
        <p>While the department cannot say how many officers have tested positive for H.I.V. or are already suffering from AIDS, Mr. Yurcik, the police union and a gay officers' group estimate that there are anywhere from two dozen to more than a hundred.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yurcik currently counsels 15 officers, referring them to treatment and other resources inside and outside the department, guiding them through their self-education about the virus and sharing his experiences with them. In some cases, he said, the officers are so uninformed that they do not even know that the letters A-I-D-S stand for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</p>
        <p>Several of those 15 officers talked to a reporter at Mr. Yurcik's urging, on the condition that their names and other identifying information be withheld.</p>
        <p>Although by law workers cannot be compelled to tell their employers that they have AIDS or any other disease, Mr. Yurcik said that one of his messages to the officers was that they could trust the department. ''The P.D. is waiting there to help you,'' he tells them.</p>
        <p>But even the officer who contracted the virus after being bitten is adamant that his condition remain a secret, despite the department's official acknowledgment that his illness resulted from a line-of-duty injury, a risk faced by every officer who patrols the streets.</p>
        <p>''You can't tell anybody,'' the officer said. ''You've got to keep it to yourself. It's something you really don't want other people knowing, because you don't want people to look at you differently.''</p>
        <p>The officer said he was devastated when he learned he had contracted the virus, and he credits Mr. Yurcik for helping him and his family through some of the most difficult times. ''It drove me to my knees,'' he said quietly. ''I want to help other police officers. I want other police officers to recognize that they can come forward with any problem they have and the department will help them and the P.B.A. will help them,'' he said, referring to the police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yurcik said he believed that greater awareness about officers with AIDS and better education about the disease within the department would encourage officers to come forward and, eventually, would help reduce the stigma they feel.</p>
        <p>''I know the cruelty and maliciousness of cops, their humor,'' Mr. Yurcik said with a half smile. He recalled a troubled co-worker who returned to work at the Midtown South Precinct months after attempting suicide to find a noose draped over his locker and razor blades taped to its door.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Yurcik said he also knew the kindness of his fellow officers, and he is still moved when he talks about the help he got after his wife died. He tells the officers he counsels that they will find the same support when they are ready to confide in their partners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yurcik said that in 1992, he told an officer he worked with in Midtown South's plainclothes anticrime team that his wife was dying of AIDS and that he had tested positive for H.I.V. It was a secret he had kept for two years at her insistence.</p>
        <p>''I told him to go back and tell the guys,'' recalls Mr. Yurcik, who takes 40 pills a day to suppress the virus. ''He went back and told everybody. They were blown away. They were totally blown away. And I just got flooded with calls. And it was genuine -- you can tell with these things.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''Most of the people that get the confidence to tell their partners are surprised to see how they react.''</p>
        <p>That is a message that Patrick J. Lynch, the P.B.A. president, also wants to get out. He said that he had met with Mr. Yurcik and that he wanted him to address the union's more than 500 delegates so they, in turn, could educate the rank and file.</p>
        <p>''What we don't want is for these officers to feel that they have to hide,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''We want them to know that this union is going to support them. Straight or gay, black or white, we all wear a blue uniform, we're all cops.''</p>
        <p>But the officers who have tested positive for H.I.V. say their instinct to hide is only reinforced when they see their colleagues treat H.I.V.-infected citizens or prisoners with cruelty and indifference.</p>
        <p>One officer listened to colleagues complain that their tax dollars were being wasted on AIDS treatment and research. ''Each one was like, 'No way, let them die; if you get AIDS, you deserve it, you're gay,' '' the officer said.</p>
        <p>She tried to point out that women also get the disease, but her colleagues did not care. ''They said, 'My money is not going to pay for these people's medicine.' ''</p>
        <p>She had heard it all before, the officer said, adding, ''And these are people I like.''</p>
        <p>Another officer recalled responding to a report of a person who was sick. He and a second officer found a man who was dying of AIDS being treated by paramedics in his family's apartment. As soon as the second officer heard the word ''AIDS'' he said, ''Let's get out of here.'' But the first officer insisted that they stay until the paramedics cleared them to leave, which is standard procedure.</p>
        <p>''I got angry with him,'' the officer said. ''Not because of my situation, but because of what these people are going through. One of their loved ones was deteriorating, and you're going to have something harsh come out of his mouth?''</p>
        <p>Two officers who agreed to be interviewed said their decision to remain silent was greatly complicated by fears that if they themselves were shot or injured, they could infect a colleague or someone else.</p>
        <p>''My God, what if I get cut?'' said the Hispanic officer who is a single mother. ''What's going to happen? I was afraid of getting someone else sick. What if I have a car accident?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yurcik said that there were no documented cases of the disease being spread through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and that even in instances in which an officer was shot or badly cut, the likelihood of a colleague's being infected from contact with the blood was almost nil.</p>
        <p>Still, every officer in the department is trained to take precautions, like avoiding unprotected contact with blood by using equipment like rubber gloves, which are standard issue in every patrol car, and masks.</p>
        <p>The officer said her biggest concerns were her children and her ability to support them. ''The first thing that ran through my head, aside from dying, was, 'I'm not going to have this job, and I'm not going to have my house, and I'm not going to be able to take care of my kids,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Yurcik's easy manner and quick laugh helped to put her at ease. He told her the department would not take her job away and would help take care of her.</p>
        <p>''He told me about himself, how he's had it for so long,'' she said, and  he referred her to his own doctor. ''Now, I feel like I am capable of doing my job and I feel comfortable in my environment.''</p>
        <p>The openly gay officer was comfortable enough with his patrol partner to reveal his infection and has found support and understanding inside the radio car they share. But while he has told his union delegate and the police surgeon because he often takes time off from work, he says he is terrified to tell anyone else.</p>
        <p>''I don't like to be rejected,'' said the officer, who is in his 30's and received the diagnosis in 1998. ''Some people will push you to the side, and if anything, that is the time that you need people to be closer to you.''</p>
        <p>He said that many of his fellow male officers had grown accustomed to being around a gay man. But he still fears that their reaction to AIDS would be fear and rejection.</p>
        <p>He said that he knew two other officers who he thinks are H.I.V.-positive and that he wanted to reach out to them: one who dates a gay man he knows is sick and another who is straight and is beginning to show signs of the illness.</p>
        <p>''I just want to pull them to the side and tell them the truth about my situation, and maybe they will open up and talk to me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Yurcik acknowledges that it may be easier for him to talk publicly about his infection than it is for a gay officer, he still feels that he has something to teach other officers.</p>
        <p>And some of Mr. Yurcik's friends who are still on the force credit him with opening their eyes about both disease and prejudice.</p>
        <p>Detective Frank R. Favilla, who works fraud cases for the Manhattan district attorney's office and grew up with Mr. Yurcik in Queens, says his close friend's illness has had a profound effect on him.</p>
        <p>''My best friend is sick,'' he said, his eyes betraying some of the sadness that has come with his education. ''The whole thing, it changes you. You get older, you get wiser and you realize that people aren't sick because they're bad people.''</p>
