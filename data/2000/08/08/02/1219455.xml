        <p>Every Wednesday, a crowd gathers in the Plaza of Martyrs here for a ritual as unsparing and inescapable as the brutal midday sun. They circle a statue of a slender man releasing a dove to the heavens hoping that their pleas, too, will rise above the din and indifference.</p>

        <p>Every Wednesday, a crowd gathers in the Plaza of Martyrs here for a ritual as unsparing and inescapable as the brutal midday sun. They circle a statue of a slender man releasing a dove to the heavens hoping that their pleas, too, will rise above the din and indifference.</p>
        <p>''We are not going to hide from the assassins,'' they chant. ''The people are like the trees. We will bend but we will not break.''</p>
        <p>Nor will they budge. What started with 11 people in 1997 over the beatings, rapes and murders committed under the regime that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a 1991 coup has grown to a weekly march of more than 100 men and women.</p>
        <p>They are part of a national movement seeking an end to the tradition of impunity here that has allowed those with money or political clout to escape judgment. At the Plaza of Martyrs, the victims and their relatives carry picket signs like crosses slung over their shoulders -- and they say it is an easy burden compared with the scars they carry on their bodies or in their minds.</p>
        <p>''This is my husband,'' said Jocelyne St.-Germain as she held out a photograph taken at his funeral. His brown suit was spotless. His face was bruised and bloody. She said masked men came to their home soon after the coup and killed him because he had supported Mr. Aristide.</p>
        <p>Ever since the coup's leaders were routed in 1994, she has been waiting to find the men who made her a widow. ''My husband was sacrificed for this government,'' Ms. St.-Germain  said, tucking her husband's picture back into her purse. ''Now they have to make an effort to get those responsible. My husband died for Aristide.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aristide was restored to power and then succeeded in office by an ally, Rene Preval, but it has taken all this time for the country's justice system, weakened by long years of dictatorship, to begin to deal with the issue.</p>
        <p>In the coming months, the officers who led the coup will finally stand trial -- albeit in absentia because  they are in exile -- along with the soldiers and paramilitary forces accused in a massacre during the coup era in the Raboteau neighborhood of the town of Gonaives.</p>
        <p>A second trial is expected in the case of six policemen accused of executing several gang members last year and of killing witnesses to the executions.</p>
        <p>Although the public is still skittish over more recent violence, the trials are seen by many as critical to restoring not only confidence in the justice system, but also faith in the future itself. ''What happens in any democratic transition is there is pressure toward reconciliation, which usually means forgetting,'' said Brian Concannon, an American lawyer who has been helping the Haitian justice system with the Raboteau case. ''That's fine for the businessmen and politicians, but it doesn't work for the victims.''</p>
        <p>The demonstrations at the Plaza of Martyrs started as therapy for the coup victims by Lovensky Pierre-Antoine, a psychologist who ran an underground clinic of sorts during the coup years. During those years, he said, people who had been raped or tortured could not seek treatment at hospitals because they feared arrest.</p>
        <p>After the restoration of constitutional rule, he continued to work with the victims and started the September 30th Foundation, named for the date of the coup, which began the marches. He fashioned his work after the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the Argentine group whose vigils sought justice for sons and daughters who vanished during that country's military regime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pierre-Antoine sees the weekly gatherings as an important way to help rebuild the tattered social contract. ''One of the dirty jobs of the coup was that it took away the dignity of the people,'' he said. ''To forget is not therapeutic. On the contrary, when you forget something it goes deeper into your mind and changes how you behave toward the people around you.''</p>
        <p>But restoring people's dignity, he said, ultimately depends on restoring confidence in Haiti's courts, which for decades were under the control of dictators and the rich. That is why many Haitians are looking to the coming trials as a bellwether.</p>
        <p>Camille LeBlanc, Haiti's justice minister, said that these high-profile cases, in which attacks were aimed at entire communities and were witnessed by many, were easier to prosecute than crimes against individuals, where the trial would hinge on the conflicting testimonies of two people.</p>
        <p>The Raboteau case, he said, will put on trial not only actual gunmen, who chased down their victims as they fled into the sea, but also the army generals and leaders of the Revolutionary Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti, the paramilitary group, which created the political atmosphere that led to the massacres. Mr. LeBlanc is intent on sending a message to the high-ranking officers in exile.</p>
        <p>''The intellectual authors bear the same responsibility as the material authors,'' Mr. LeBlanc said. ''Everyone is accountable.''</p>
        <p>The desire to root out the crimes of the coup has also propelled a campaign for the United States to return documents it seized from the paramilitary group and the Haitian military during the invasion to restore Mr. Aristide to power. Among the  contents are ''trophy photographs'' of torturers with their victims, which Haitian authorities would like to use as evidence in criminal proceedings.  Mr. Concannon, who has also helped rally international support for the return of the documents, said they could also help build a case against the coup's leaders.</p>
        <p>State Department officials said they had returned the documents to the American Embassy in Port-au-Prince, although without the names of American citizens, who they said were covered under American laws protecting privacy. Haitian officials insist that the documents are the property of the Haitian government and that they will accept only the unexpurgated files.</p>
        <p>''We're not asking for the C.I.A. to give us their deep dark secrets,'' Mr. Concannon said. ''We only asking them to give us our secrets.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps tucked somewhere in those files is the answer to the painful mystery that haunts Efemie Jean-Pierre every time she looks at her 5-year-old son, Philippe.</p>
        <p>''They killed my husband, those men without mothers,'' she said of the night in 1994 when the soldiers came calling. ''They came to my house afterward and they beat me up. Then they tied me up and raped me. I became pregnant. I had a baby from them.''</p>
        <p>One day, she said, she will tell that child everything -- perhaps even who the father is, if he is ever caught. ''Justice is closed in this country,'' she said. ''The box is closed. We have to work until the box is open and we find out who did this to us.''</p>
