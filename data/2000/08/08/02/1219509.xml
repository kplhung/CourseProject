        <p>Among the speakers on this evening's program:</p>
        <p>Trent Lott  Senator from Mississippi</p>
        <p>Combining firebrand conservatism and polished tactical skills, Trent Lott, the majority leader in the Senate, has climbed the ranks of the Republican Party. Mr. Lott, 58, a gregarious lawyer who was once the party's House whip, vaulted over more senior members to the party's top job in the Senate in 1994. His smooth television performances and openly partisan manner won over many young Republicans, as he moved to the Senate from the House. He is the first person to hold whip positions in both houses of Congress. Mr. Lott, the son of a cotton farmer turned shipyard worker and a teacher from Grenada County, Miss., began his political career on the other side of the aisle, working for Representative William Colmer, Democrat of Mississippi, in 1968.</p>

        <p>James S. Gilmore III  Governor of Virginia</p>
        <p>James S. Gilmore III is at the epicenter of a Republican Party in Virginia that had been left for dead just five years ago. But for the first time in a century, Republicans now hold all three of the top statewide elected offices. In 1997, Mr. Gilmore, 50, orchestrated something of a tour de force, turning an underdog run for governor into a rout. He picked a clear message -- cut the tax on personal vehicles -- and he never wavered. Exit polling indicated that this message, and his steadfastness, won over voters. Mr. Gilmore, who was born in Richmond, Va., and still lives there, served in the Army as a counterintelligence specialist in Germany before receiving a law degree from the University of Virginia. Along the road to the governor's mansion, he practiced law, served as county attorney and was elected attorney general in 1993.</p>
        <p>Richard J. Riordan  Mayor of Los Angeles</p>
        <p>The first Republican mayor of the largely Democratic and liberal Los Angeles in more than 30 years, Richard J. Riordan is known for fighting crime and municipal ineffeciency. He won his race in 1993 largely on the strength of white voters as fears of a surging crime rate and the racial unrest that followed the acquittal of four white police officers who were accused of beating a black motorist, Rodney G. King, were a recent memory.Before winning his first term he made millions as a venture capitalist and investment banker, and was a philanthropist and Los Angeles power broker. He is comfortable with politicians from both parties and worked tirelessly to ensure that the Democratic National Convention would be held in Los Angeles later this month -- often against the Democrat-controlled City Council. ''The Democratic convention is a huge plus for the city of Los Angeles, and that's my first love,'' he said recently. ''My first love is not the Republican Party.''</p>
        <p>Raul J. Fernandez  Technology company owner</p>
        <p>Raul J. Fernandez, 34, has been called one of the wealthiest men under 40 in the country by Forbes magazine. A former aide to Jack F. Kemp in Congress, he is now chairman and chief executive of Proxicom, an Internet consulting company in Reston, Va. With $40,000 in savings, Mr. Fernandez founded the company in 1991, three years after leaving Mr. Kemp's office. The company reported revenue of $50.9 million for the second quarter of 2000. As a young aide to Mr. Kemp, Mr. Fernandez researched tax legislation and debated financing for rebels in Nicaragua while working on the office's computer system. (As of November, Mr. Kemp owned more than $2.3 million in Proxicom stock.)</p>
