        <p>ALEXANDER-Lawrence H. Dearly beloved husband, the light of my life, mourned deeply by Margaret, his wife of 35 years. He was a truly unique man of outer as well as inner beauty; multi-faceted in his interests, a force in the field of education, a true gentleman. He leaves behind for me a void impossible to fill. He also leaves precious memories of the joys we shared through the years. Rest in peace, my dearest one!</p>
        <p>ALEXANDER-Lawrence H. Deceased 7/16/00. Founding principal P.S. 205, Queens. Husband (Margaret), father, stepfather, grandfather, brother, friend. No services.</p>
        <p>ALEXANDER-Lawrence H. Stepfather par excellence, a man of unparalleled giftedness, precious friend, beloved ally. Dr. Irma Jacqueline Ozer</p>
