        <p>In a deal as complex as his patented method of selling airplane tickets, Jay S. Walker, the founder of Priceline.com, agreed yesterday to sell $190 million of his shares to Paul G. Allen's Vulcan Ventures and John C. Malone's Liberty Media Group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker declined to say how much each investor was getting.</p>
        <p>The sale can be seen as quite a loss for Mr. Walker. Last November, he bought 2.1 million Priceline shares from Delta Air Lines for $59.93 a share. Now he has agreed to sell eight million shares at $23.75 each. After taxes, he said, he will wind up with about $125 million, which he will invest in Priceline's WebHouse Club, its affiliate that sells groceries and gasoline.</p>
        <p>After this sale, Mr. Walker will still own some 50 million shares, worth about $1.2 billion. But those shares were worth six times that in April 1999, about a month after Priceline's initial public offering. And the stock has been in free fall since March -- sliding from $104, to $23.625 Monday. Yesterday, however, the share price rose $1.31, to $24.94, as investors considered the deal a vote of confidence by Liberty and Vulcan rather than as a bearish signal.</p>
        <p>''He's not taking the money and running,'' said Mark J. Rowen, an analyst with Prudential Securities. ''He's putting it back into WebHouse.'' Mr. Rowen had downgraded Priceline's stock last week because he was concerned that the company's grocery business was not growing fast enough to compensate for the slowing growth in its travel sales.</p>
        <p>Priceline, notable for its ubiquitous advertising featuring the labored crooning of William Shatner, allows customers to name their own price for airline tickets, hotel rooms and an increasing number of other products.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker said he was reluctant to sell his shares at this low price and that he had held off completing the deal with Vulcan and Liberty in hopes that the market would be buoyed by Priceline's second-quarter earnings, which were released last week. Despite an operating loss that was only a penny a share better than analysts had expected, the company's shares continued to fall.</p>
        <p>The purchase by Liberty and Vulcan is organized as a forward sale in that Mr. Walker receives the payment now, but he does not deliver the shares to Liberty or Vulcan for a year or two. That way, investors can be assured that the shares will not be sold in the market the moment that Priceline's stock ticks up.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want the market to feel I was putting pressure on Priceline's shares,'' Mr. Walker said. ''The last thing that Priceline's stock needs is more pressure.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the effective price Mr. Walker is receiving is less than $23.75, because he also granted Liberty and Vulcan an option to buy an undisclosed portion of his share in Walker Digital, a company that is devoted to thinking up and patenting new ideas for businesses. The options give Liberty and Vulcan the right to buy the shares from him at a price that values Walker Digital at $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft who has accumulated a portfolio of companies involved in the Internet and cable television, already owns about 5 percent of Priceline.</p>
        <p>Liberty, a tracking stock of AT&amp;T,  is an independent investment vehicle of Mr. Malone's that owns interests in a number of media and technology companies, including smaller stakes in Priceline and WebHouse.</p>
        <p>While WebHouse appears to be an integral part of Priceline, linked to its Web site and using Mr. Shatner as a spokesman, it is owned by Mr. Walker, Walker Digital and a group of investors. Priceline owns no shares in WebHouse, but has an option to buy a controlling interest.</p>
        <p>WebHouse, in many ways, is far more elaborate and expensive to build than Priceline itself, because customers bid for products on the Internet, pay for them with a credit card, then pick them up at stores and gas stations with a special card.</p>
        <p>''This is as complicated as Visa,'' Mr. Walker said. ''We are building a system that connects 80,000 cash registers in 7,000 stores. Last week we priced two million grocery items. I'll do that for 100 million transactions next year.''</p>
        <p>WebHouse has already raised $200 million from a group of investors and is currently raising another $145 million, including Mr. Walker's $125 million. Mr. Walker said that the company would need to raise more money.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, WebHouse is meant to offer manufacturers an alternative to paper coupons to get potential customers to try their products. But while it has many of the biggest supermarket chains participating, leading manufacturers like Procter &amp; Gamble and Lever Brothers have not. As a result, WebHouse is selling goods for less than it pays for them.</p>
        <p>But even Mr. Rowen, the analyst who downgraded Priceline's stock, argues that selling $2 jars of peanut butter for $1.50 may just be smart.  ''Priceline is not a typical consumer business,'' he said. ''Their model is they first have to get the consumer demand. Then they sell the demand, in essence, to the highest bidder.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 3, 2000, Thursday  A headline in Business Day yesterday about the sale of $190 million in Priceline.com shares to Liberty Media and Vulcan Ventures misidentified the seller. It was Jay S. Walker, the company's founder, not Priceline itself. A picture caption with the article misstated the location of Walker Digital, where Mr. Walker was shown. It is in Stamford, Conn., not Norwalk.</p>
