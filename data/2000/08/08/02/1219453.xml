        <p>In an irrational world, a rational investor may be at a severe disadvantage.</p>
        <p>So it is with MIPS Technologies, a semiconductor equipment company whose share price has gyrated wildly this year. It fell from a high of more than $111 on March 14 to a low under $17 on May 24 and has since rebounded to more than $46.</p>
        <p>Such swings are not all that unusual in this year's technology yo-yo, in which companies go from beloved to hated and back faster than a teenager can develop a crush. But MIPS stands out because it has two classes of stock. What is amazing is not the absolute prices of these shares, but their relative prices.</p>
        <p>Since the second class of shares began trading in late June, they have traded at an inexplicable discount to the original shares. More than a few clever investors, seeing that spread, have tried to take advantage of it. Their strategy has been completely rational. It has also been very unsuccessful. Against all reason, the discount has widened. Rational investors who thought they saw a sure profit now have substantial losses.</p>
        <p>Before getting to the details, here are the basic facts: MIPS used to be a subsidiary of Silicon Graphics, which took the subsidiary public through a 1998 initial public offering, and then sold more shares to the public in 1999.</p>
        <p>For tax reasons, Silicon Graphics wanted to keep 80 percent voting control even though it owned only about 65 percent of the stock after that second offering. So it put through a reclassification that allowed its Class B shares to elect 80 percent of the board members, while Class A shares -- the ones in public hands -- could elect only 20 percent of the board. Other than votes, however, the shares were equal. They have equal rights to dividends and to any other distributions by the company.</p>
        <p>In June, Silicon Graphics got out of MIPS entirely by spinning off the Class B shares to its shareholders. Beginning June 21, there were 25.1 million shares of Class B, trading under the Nasdaq symbol MIPSB, and 13.4 million shares of Class A, trading under the symbol MIPS.</p>
        <p>Logically, the MIPSB shares ought to be worth the same -- or perhaps a bit more -- than the Class A shares, reflecting the additional voting rights and the fact that more of them are in public hands and available for trading. But when the shares began trading in June, the Class B shares were trading at a small discount of about $1 a share to the original shares.</p>
        <p>Such discounts are not unusual in the early days of a spinoff. Shareholders of a parent company often sell the spunoff shares soon after they arrive, particularly if they wound up with only a few shares of the new company. That clearly could have happened in this case -- only 13.86 shares of MIPS B were distributed for each 100 shares of Silicon Graphics.</p>
        <p>It appears that some investors tried to take advantage of the discrepancy in the prices of the two shares by borrowing Class A shares and selling them short while buying Class B shares. That strategy guaranteed a profit if the price differential were eliminated, as a rational investor would expect.</p>
        <p>But instead it widened. On June 27, the gap between the two shares suddenly leaped to more than $3. It soon settled at $2 to $3, but then grew again on July 12 to more than $5.</p>
        <p>With some fluctuation, the difference has remained about that ever since. Yesterday, the gap stood at $5.625, or 12 percent, as the MIPS shares closed at $46.6875 and the MIPSB shares ended the day at $41.0625.</p>
        <p>Casey Eichler, the chief financial officer of MIPS, said in an interview that he was puzzled by the discrepancy. But he said one possibility was that many individual investors had not yet grasped that there are two shares of stock available. ''Without question, there is more retail focus on'' the old shares, he said. ''They just type in the symbol MIPS and don't know MIPSB.''</p>
        <p>There is some evidence to support that view, since MIPS tends to have more small trades than MIPSB.</p>
        <p>But there is more at work here than uninformed retail investors. Nasdaq reports short interest -- the number of shares that have been borrowed and sold short -- monthly, and those figures indicate that the short interest in MIPS has soared. On June 12, shortly before the spinoff, the reported short interest was about 1.7 million shares. But by July 11, it had leaped to 3.1 million shares.</p>
        <p>The Class B shares would seem to offer greater liquidity, since nearly twice as many of them are outstanding as are Class A shares. But in fact they have traded at lower volume. Total volume for the month of July in Class B shares came to 8.5 million shares, or about a third of the shares outstanding. Total volume for Class A shares came to 20 million shares, or about 1.5 times the number of shares outstanding.</p>
        <p>What may have happened is that some of the investors who received Class B shares in the distribution from Silicon Graphics were reluctant to sell them at the discount. Instead, they sold Class A shares short.</p>
        <p>Robert Gordon, the president of 21st Securities, a firm that specializes in various forms of arbitrage, said he considered shorting the Class A shares and buying the Class B ones but concluded that the risk of a short squeeze was too great. In such a squeeze, an investor who has sold a stock short is forced to buy it back, often because it has become difficult or impossible to borrow the shares.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gordon added that ''Anyone who owns MIPS Class A should certainly sell it and buy MIPS Class B.''</p>
        <p>There is no question that is the rational thing to do. But so far being rational has not been the same thing as being right in MIPS.</p>
