        <p>Units of the Grey Global Group in New York are being reorganized.</p>
        <p>Three executives are being named to new posts at the Western division of Grey Worldwide in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Jeff Alperin, the chief executive, is leaving to pursue a career in the financial sector, the agency said. Mr. Alperin, 46, who joined Grey in 1978, had been chief executive since January 1995.</p>
        <p>In the Los Angeles office, John Crosson, 38, executive vice president and managing director, becomes president and chief operating officer, and Peter Mooney, 47, executive vice president and creative director, becomes president and chief creative officer. Kieran Hannon, 38, executive vice president and co-managing director at the San Francisco office, becomes president and chief operating officer there. No one will assume Mr. Alperin's duties as chief executive of the division.</p>
        <p>In addition, the media employees at the two offices will become part of MediaCom, the worldwide media unit of Grey Global. Darlene Hayman, 45, and Alan May, 43, executive vice presidents at MediaCom, will head the Los Angeles and San Francisco operations, respectively.</p>
