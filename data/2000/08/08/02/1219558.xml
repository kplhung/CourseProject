        <p>President Clinton has said that it is time for the Palestinians to take a step forward in the Middle East peace talks ahead of a Sept. 13 deadline, according to a White House transcript made public today.</p>
        <p>Now that Mr. Barak has survived a no-confidence vote in his Parliament, Mr. Clinton said, the pressure is on Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.</p>
        <p>''We just have to see if we can get some movement from the Palestinians as well, and see if we can put this thing together again,'' the president told an interviewer from WTVT, a Fox television station in Tampa. Mr. Clinton's interview was conducted Monday afternoon, and the White House released the transcript today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, on a political swing through Florida, confirmed in the interview that Jerusalem was the sticking point that prevented agreement at last month's Camp David summit meeting, but he expressed optimism.</p>
        <p>''Yes, I think there will be peace in the region; yes, Jerusalem is the most difficult issue,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''They did not agree on everything else. But they're close enough that I think that we can still get an agreement.''</p>
        <p>He said he had seen progress during the Camp David talks -- ''sort of the body language that the Israelis and the Palestinians, the way they relate to each other.'' And he referred to the pressures of the calendar. ''They have pledged to finish by the 13th of September,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''And that puts all kind of pressure, especially on the Palestinians.''</p>
        <p>The most recent interim peace agreement expires on Sept. 13, and the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership has pledged to declare a state unilaterally if a permanent peace has not been reached by that date.</p>
