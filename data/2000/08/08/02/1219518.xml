        <p>McCAIN OFFERS WORDS OF ASSURANCE  Trying to erase tensions from the raw primary battle, Senator John McCain commended Gov. George W. Bush yesterday in a speech at the Republican convention, saying the Texas governor would ably defend the nation's interests abroad. Throughout the evening, a parade of military heroes -- from Mr. McCain to Bob Dole to Gen. J. Norman Schwarzkopf -- offered testimonials to Mr. Bush. Joining the chorus was Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's chief international affairs adviser, who, as a black, also underscored Mr. Bush's pledge to place minorities in consequential roles.</p>
        <p>BUSH CALLS CLINTON 'DESPERATE'  Prompted by a series of digs by President Clinton, Gov. George W. Bush took him on directly yesterday. As he campaigned en route to the convention, Mr. Bush said the president was ''so desperate to have his legacy intact by getting Al Gore elected, he'll say anything.'' At a recent Democratic fund-raiser, Mr. Clinton characterized Mr. Bush's message, in part, as ''How bad could I be? I've been governor of Texas. My daddy was president.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also drew an angry response from the senior Mr. Bush, who told NBC yesterday that if Mr. Clinton persisted in belittling his son, ''I'm going to tell the nation what I think about him as a human being and a person.''</p>

        <p>CHENEY STILL LEARNING ABOUT CAMPAIGNING  Dick Cheney served in public life for more than a quarter-century, as White House chief of staff, congressman and secretary of defense. But he has not run for office since 1988, and as George W. Bush's running mate, he is in many ways a neophyte on the national campaign trail. He seems utterly at ease giving short, serious speeches and fielding tough questions from Sunday TV talk show hosts. But give him a crowd and a rope line, and Mr. Cheney rushes through, visibly relieved when he's finished. Even Governor Bush has gently poked fun at his partner's dry campaign style, but he praises Mr. Cheney and brags that picking him was a ''presidential decision.''</p>
