        <p>Tonight, for the second night in a row, one of the principal speakers at the Republican National Convention was a black person.

        <p>Tonight, for the second night in a row, one of the principal speakers at the Republican National Convention was a black person. Tonight, it was Condoleezza Rice, the chief national security adviser to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas; on Monday night, it was Colin L. Powell, who may be secretary of state if Mr. Bush is elected president.</p>
        <p>Amazing stuff.</p>
        <p>Obviously, this was no happenstance. In this convention, whose sole mission is to glorify Mr. Bush, happenstance just doesn't happen.</p>
        <p>Equally obviously, neither Ms. Rice nor General Powell was on the dais as window-dressing. Both are eminent figures, whose success in the academic and military worlds speaks volumes about the achievements of black Americans in the last couple of decades. But there was window-dressing as well -- black singers, black choirs, black candidates for lesser offices and black children seated at school desks in the backdrop to the speech of the prospective nominee's wife, Laura, a former schoolteacher.</p>
        <p>The question occurs, what is all this about? Granting that Mr. Bush has demonstrated in his brief political career a much greater sensitivity to minority concerns than the average Republican, what political purpose lies behind the image-making?</p>
        <p>Does he really think he can do better among blacks than his father, who took 12 percent and 10 percent of the black vote in 1988 and 1992, respectively, and better than Bob Dole, who took 12 percent in 1996? Or is it a three-cushion shot, a subtle play for the votes of white suburbanites, a pivotal voting block that includes many voters for whom civil rights remains a high priority?</p>
        <p>''He has no chance of getting any significant African-American vote,'' said David Bositis of the nonpartisan Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. ''This is not even about that. It's about the suburbs, and about moderate swing voters all across the country.''</p>
        <p>At the moment, the cold facts are these: The Democrats are a multiracial party, with large numbers of blacks in leadership positions. The Republicans are largely a mono-racial party. Since World War II, only three African-American Republicans have been elected to Congress.</p>
        <p>General Powell said bluntly that there was widespread ''cynicism in the black community'' toward the Republican party, based in part on its opposition to affirmative action. He challenged the Republicans to reach out to blacks and other minority communities.</p>
        <p>''And not just during an election-year campaign,'' he continued. ''It must be a sustained effort.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush acknowledged that ''we have a lot of work to do.''</p>
        <p>But Democrats expressed skepticism that it would ever get done. Speaking at the alternative convention here, the Rev. Jesse Jackson praised General Powell but said that his speech was part of a ''sham.'' Noting that this is a largely white convention -- only 4 percent of the delegates are black, about the same as in 1972 -- Mr. Jackson added, ''You got Powell making speeches but you got Trent Lott making policy'' -- a reference to the Senate majority leader, a conservative from Mississippi.</p>
        <p>According to exit polls conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of television networks and The Associated Press, Mr. Bush took 27 percent of the black vote in his re-election contest in 1998. That may have been an exaggeration of his true strength, because his Democratic opponent, Tony Mauro, was never seen as a viable alternative. Mr. Bush did much less well against Ann Richards in 1994, winning 15 percent of the black vote then.</p>
        <p>During this year's campaign, he made a point of appearing before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. But in South Carolina, when Senator John McCain of Arizona was pressing him hard, Mr. Bush was unwilling to condemn the flying of the Confederate battle flag on the statehouse, and he campaigned at Bob Jones University in Greenville, which banned interracial dating at the time of his speech.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has also described Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, dyed-in-the-wool conservatives whose very names are anathema to many blacks -- even though Mr. Thomas is himself black -- as model Supreme Court justices.</p>
        <p>To many African-Americans, those actions seemed of a piece with Richard M. Nixon's southern strategy, which built a lasting base for the Republicans among Southern white voters. It was not explicitly anti-black, but it was grounded in racial apprehensions. Ever since, the Republican Party has had, to a greater or lesser degree, a white southern core, and its leadership on Capitol Hill has been largely southern.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, meanwhile, has emerged as the most popular president among African-Americans since Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the Voting Rights Act, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who espoused their cause during the Depression, when many of them had trouble finding enough to eat.</p>
        <p>''Most of my friends see him as a kind of god,'' said a black Republican delegate here, who asked that his name not be used. ''Some of that rubs off on Al Gore, and it makes Bush's job in November terribly difficult.''</p>
        <p>The latest New York Times/CBS News poll, taken between July 20 and 22, suggested how difficult a job Mr. Bush faces in courting black votes. In a two-way race, Mr. Gore won the support of 84 percent of African-Americans to Mr. Bush's 6 percent.</p>
        <p>At a first glance, blacks would seem to be ripe for conversion to Republicanism. In nationwide telephone surveys conducted by The Times and CBS News since 1976, between a quarter and a third of black voters have described themselves as conservatives, but only 6 percent to 11 percent have described themselves as Republicans. Even making allowances for those who use the word ''conservative'' in its social rather than political sense, and apply it to themselves because they are regular churchgoers, for example, the Republicans should have an opportunity.</p>
        <p>In recent years, moreover, more and more blacks have reached the middle class, have moved into prosperous suburbs and have joined the professions. According to a new study called Black America 2000, the income levels of black households have tripled in the past 24 years, and the number of black-owned businesses more than doubled in number between 1987 and 1997.</p>
        <p>When other groups have undergone such changes, significant numbers among them have migrated to the Republican party. But so far, that pattern has not held for blacks.</p>
        <p>In any event, things are going well for Mr. Bush among white suburbanites. The same Times/CBS poll showed him ahead of the Mr. Gore among that group, 52 percent to 34.</p>
        <p>If, as Mr. Bositis and a number of Republican tacticians suggested, Mr. Bush's real aim in appealing to blacks is to solidify his support among white moderates, he would not be the first Republican nominee to try that ploy. In 1980, Ronald Reagan made much of his endorsement by the civil rights leaders Ralph David Abernathy and Hosea Williams.  His black support barely budged;  but that was not the point, a strategist, Richard Wirthlin, later explained. The target, Mr. Wirthlin said, was white suburbanites.</p>
