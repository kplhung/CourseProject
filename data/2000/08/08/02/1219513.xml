        <p>Accusing the Republican Party of using its convention to mask Gov. George W. Bush's stands on controversial issues, Democrats and groups with close ties to them are unleashing commercials that criticize his record in Texas as well as his positions on gun control and abortion.</p>
        <p>The groups -- Planned Parenthood, Handgun Control and the Sierra Club -- are all running commercials singling out Mr. Bush in a week in which Republicans are staging a convention that was intended to sidestep divisive topics like abortion.</p>
        <p>But the biggest barrage is coming from the Democratic National Committee, which has been releasing at least one new advertisement each day, and plans to continue doing so.</p>
        <p>Today, the committee unveiled a 30-second commercial, to be broadcast in 17 crucial states from the Pacific Northwest to New England, that accuses Mr. Bush of favoring ''the big drug companies, the H.M.O.s and the insurance industry'' over Texas residents.</p>
        <p>Democratic staff members, including one of the party's national chairmen, Joe Andrew, have set up shop here to reinforce their contention that the Republicans are glossing over what they view as Mr. Bush's deeply conservative agenda in an effort to appeal to moderate Democrats and independents.</p>
        <p>''They're trying to create an illusion that they are something other than they are,'' Mr. Andrew said, adding that his party has more than 20 staff members and a bus, called the Rolling Donkey, that ferries reporters to the news conferences it is holding in Sheet Metal Hall, a couple of miles from the First Union Center, where the Republicans are meeting. ''We knew they were going to try to set up this Vegas lounge act, and not tell people who they are,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have injected a bit of partisan invective into an otherwise thoroughly upbeat, stage-managed week in Philadelphia. It is a reminder that though the campaign has been a fairly understated affair, it could get a lot tougher fast.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andrew said that with all the mass communication techniques -- the party is running seven anti-Bush Web sites -- it may sound as if the strategy is novel. ''But it's not,'' he said. ''It's actually old-fashioned. We're back to making sure people know what's going on.''</p>
        <p>The Republicans say the Democrats' strategy is a sign of weakness.</p>
        <p>''I think the Democrats look at Governor Bush's inclusive style and they've gone into full party panic,'' said Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman. ''The more they attack, the more people don't like Al Gore's manner of campaigning. They are sick and tired of this.''</p>
        <p>The latest commercial follows a theme that forces allied with Democrats have been returning to again and again: Mr. Bush's record in Texas. This one compares the governor's commitment to health care unfavorably with Mr. Gore's. ''George Bush: his plan protects special interests instead of working families,'' the announcer says as the screen shows a black and white portrait of an utterly forlorn woman in a wheelchair.</p>
        <p>The special interest groups say their goal is to ensure that like-minded voters who might be misled by the convivial tone of the convention and the campaign understand that on issues like health care and abortion rights, Mr. Bush is out of step.</p>
        <p>Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said focus groups found that many women who identified  themselves as moderate to conservative and who supported abortion rights were not aware of Mr. Bush's opposition to abortion.</p>
        <p>''They assumed he was pro-choice because he appears moderate,'' Ms. Feldt said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Feldt said the advertising campaign, which began last month and is running on cable television stations around the country, is the first on the presidential level for the organization.</p>
        <p>''Bush has been extraordinarily successful at obfuscating, at fuzzying around the edges of issues, especially on reproductive health and rights,'' she said. Additional advertisements are planned after the party conventions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer said that the Democrats' efforts only pointed up Mr. Gore's own fuzziness on issues like gun control; Mr. Bush is considered a reliable ally of the National Rifle Association, a group Mr. Gore regularly attacks but did work with on issues when he was in Congress.</p>
        <p>''If he'd stay on one position long enough on the question of guns,'' Mr. Fleischer said, ''he'd be subject to criticism as well.''</p>
