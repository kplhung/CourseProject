        <p>Television ratings for the first night of the Republican National Convention indicated that only a small fraction of the total television audience watched the prime-time portion of the event.</p>
        <p>On ABC and CBS, the two broadcast networks that offered just an hour of prime-time coverage each, only about 13 million total viewers tuned in, or about 15 percent of the total television audience.
