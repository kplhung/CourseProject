        <p>Fair Shakes</p>
        <p>The Comfort Diners, 214 East 45th Street and 142 East 86th Street, have started their annual monthlong milkshake festival, with a different flavor every day. Today it is apple pie; tomorrow, blueberry cheesecake. Aug. 11 will be Creamsicle day and Aug. 23 s'mores. The milkshakes are $4.95 each, but $3.95 at just when you need a cooling pick-me-up, from 4 to 6 p.m.</p>

        <p>Greenwich Tastings</p>
        <p>A two-day international food and wine festival, with tastings of cheeses, chocolates, wines and spirits, as well as seminars and cooking demonstrations by chefs and authors, will be held on Saturday and Sunday in the Hyatt Regency Greenwich, 1800 East Putnam Avenue, Greenwich, Conn. Tickets, $75, include all tastings and three seminars. About 10 percent of the proceeds will be donated to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society of Western Connecticut. The number for reservations is (203) 938-0591.</p>
        <p>Slice It Thin</p>
        <p>Carpegna prosciutto, a dried ham produced in the Marches region of central Italy, is slightly sweeter and made on a smaller scale than the better-known prosciutto di Parma. It is usually cut paper-thin by hand, not machine. A slicing demonstration with samples will be given tomorrow from 1 to 4 p.m. at Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Avenue (71st Street).</p>
