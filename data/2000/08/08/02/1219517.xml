        <p>THE trade deadline was over Monday. If you counted all the relieved Yankees, you came up with a plethora, a whole bunch, a minyan, a veritable majority:</p>
        <p>Six or eight left fielders. A passel of spare infielders. A few no-name pitchers camping out in pup tents in the bullpen. Even Tino Martinez, whom Joe Torre felt the need to sedate on Sunday with the parting words, ''I'll see you Tuesday.'' Tino Martinez, for goodness' sakes.</p>
        <p>Amidst all this rampant job insecurity, there was one guy who hadn't really sweated out the deadline. Doc Gooden, the improbable Yankee, the accidental tourist, has done more than merely hold the fort. Last night he pitched seven strong innings before the Yanks finally put away Kansas City, 5-4.</p>
        <p>While some Yankees reported to the stately old castle in the Bronx with a sense of relief, Gooden showed up with the same huge smile he sported in days of old. It is summertime and the living seems easy. Doc gave up four hits, was helped by some erratic Royals base running and still has a 3-0 record with a 1.86 earned run average in five appearances in his astonishing return from the edge.</p>
        <p>''I felt like I made some progress,'' he said later. ''I took a step forward. When I came back, it was like starting over.''</p>
        <p>Doc's grin is so all-encompassing that it seems to includes a bit of a smirk at the ludicrousness of it. He is putting something over on the world, a powerball pitcher who suddenly discovers it is just as cool to see hitters splat one into the ground as it is to see them strike out lustily.</p>
        <p>Nobody is more surprised than Joe Torre, who, when presented with Gooden last month, said he had been told by the nearer-my-Steinbrenner-to-thee bunker in Florida that Gooden was the best pitcher available, not exactly strong praise.</p>
        <p>''There's no pressure,'' Torre was saying last night. ''This is a lark for him. It's like it was for me when I got fired from my last job.''</p>
        <p>Torre recalled being let go by St. Louis in 1995 and being hired, somewhat surprisingly, by the Yankees for the 1996 season, and how he was in Cincinnati, his wife's hometown, and his friends -- his friends, mind you -- were faxing him the tabloid ravings calling him Clueless Joe and other niceties. But what the heck, Torre was back in the major leagues, the way Doc Gooden is now back in the major leagues.</p>
        <p>''He got released by his last club, a club under us,'' Torre said. ''That's got to make you stop and think. He's going to enjoy this ride as long as he can.''</p>
        <p>After his strongest start last night, Gooden recalled being released on May 25 and going home to St. Petersburg, Fla., and finding himself a full-time chauffeur.</p>
        <p>''Five kids in three different schools, driving kids all over the place,'' Gooden said.</p>
        <p>He admitted he thought, for a few days, that his career might be over, until the Yankees sent him to Tampa to their pitching guru, Billy Connors, for a makeover.</p>
        <p>Torre admitted he was ''as surprised as anybody else'' when he was handed Gooden to start the Queens portion of that eccentric bicounty doubleheader with the Mets on July 8.</p>
        <p>''Doc has to thank his lucky stars we were rained out,'' Torre said. ''If it wasn't for that doubleheader -- it gave him a chance to have an adrenaline rush.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he could have envisioned Gooden's being so cerebral in his major league comeback, Torre responded with an emphatic, ''No.''</p>
        <p>''He pitched for Cleveland last year, he pitched for Houston and Tampa Bay this year,'' Torre recited. ''It was the same. He'd get deep into the pitch count. He kept trying to have you not hit the ball.''</p>
        <p>Asked to elaborate on Gooden's transformation, Torre said: ''I'd watched him pitch. I knew he had the ability to change, but I didn't know if he would. I'm pleased for him. Baseball is still big in what he does. It's great to see a smile on his face.''</p>
        <p>There will be other starts for Gooden. David Cone is still on his Boss-mandated sabbatical, studying at the feet of Connors. El Duque Hernandez started last night in the minors and may be back soon. Meanwhile, Doc Gooden is here.</p>
        <p>''When I was out of baseball in 1995, that gave me a chance to get my life together,'' Gooden said. ''This time I got a chance to get my pitching in order.''</p>
        <p>He was wearing a velvety looking warm-up outfit with a matching velvety cap, the bill turned backward. It would have been a crime to hide any part of that mammoth smile.</p>
