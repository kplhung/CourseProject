        <p>Former President Gerald R. Ford was taken to a hospital around midnight Tuesday with a sinus infection, after leaving the Republican National Convention, where he had been honored in an emotional tribute.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford, 87, was driven by his staff to the Hahnemann University Hospital, where he was treated with an antibotic. His spokesman, Calvin G. McDowell, said a wax build-up led to an infection. ''He's fine,'' Mr. McDowell said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford, walking on his own, left the hospital at 1:36 A.M. today along with his wife, Betty. ''I feel good, that's why I'm here,'' Mr. Ford said as he climbed into his car.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford appeared frail as he sat in a V.I.P. box at the back of the First Union Center on Tuesday night along with his wife, former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, and other prominent Republicans. He was visibly moved when a video-taped tribute to him was displayed on the large screens inside the hall.</p>
        <p>''When uncertainty troubled our nation, President Gerald Ford renewed America's confidence,'' Gov. George E. Pataki of New York said, introducing the tribute. ''His strength, his strength and integrity defended our values at home in an ever-changing world.''</p>
        <p>The crowd cheered when Mr. Pataki invoked ''President Ford's steady leadership and Mrs. Ford's gentle grace.''</p>
        <p>He rose and waved to acknowledge the cheers of the audience.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Ford did not address the convention, he told C-Span that this would be the last convention he and his wife would attend, calling it a ''concluding appearance to indicate our support.''</p>
        <p>Asked about his health in an interview broadcast Tuesday night on ''Larry King Live,'' the former president said, ''I couldn't be healthier.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McDowell, a spokesman for Mr. Ford, said Mr. Ford had been complaining about feeling ''uncomfortable'' and asked to be taken to the hospital. While he was at the hospital, he was visited by Andrew Card, the convention chairman.</p>
