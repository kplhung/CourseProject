        <p>DeWayne Minor will register a first in the Hambletonian on Saturday, win, place or just show up. The 43-year-old Minor will be the first African-American to drive in the richest event in harness racing, which this year has several newcomers and lacks an outstanding horse for the $1 million 75th edition.</p>
        <p>Minor will drive Legendary Lover K, who is trained by his brother, DeShawn, and is owned by his wife, Annemette. Legendary Lover K drew the No. 8 spot in the field of 10 and is the fourth choice at 6-1 in the 75th edition of the Hambletonian.</p>

        <p>DeWayne Minor will register a first in the Hambletonian on Saturday, win, place or just show up. The 43-year-old Minor will be the first African-American to drive in the richest event in harness racing, which this year has several newcomers and lacks an outstanding horse for the $1 million 75th edition.</p>
        <p>Minor will drive Legendary Lover K, who is trained by his brother, DeShawn, and is owned by his wife, Annemette. Legendary Lover K drew the No. 8 spot in the field of 10 and is the fourth choice at 6-1 in the 75th edition of the Hambletonian.</p>
        <p>''To be here, it shows that my brother and I are good horsemen,'' Minor said, motioning to DeShawn, 26, across the table from him today at the post-position draw. ''It is a big compliment for us that we are here. For me personally, it is a big accomplishment and I think we have a shot at this race.'' His brother nodded in the affirmative.</p>
        <p>John Campbell, who is seeking his sixth Hambletonian winner as a driver, said: ''There is a group of three or four horses with a chance to win. This is an evenly matched group. There are no standouts in the race.'' Campbell will drive Pine Drop, who is at 10-1 and will leave from the second spot.</p>
        <p>Dreamaster was tabbed as the early favorite at 3-1. He will leave from the No. 3 spot and will be driven by David Magee, who will also be in his first Hambletonian even though he has driven, as of last night, 8,493 winners in his career. The second choice was Uhadadream, at 7-2 (post No. 5), and the third choice was Yankee Paco, at 4-1 (post No. 7).</p>
        <p>''I'm not looking for a Stanley Dancer role,'' Magee said, referring to the legendary driver, ''but I expect a good effort from my horse.''</p>
        <p>Dreamaster has had six races this season and won them all, including his Hambletonian elimination last Saturday night, beating Legendary Lover K by almost three lengths.</p>
        <p>Legendary Lover K has been in the money in all his six races this season with three victories, one second and two thirds. He was bought by the Minors for $3,200 and a yearling and has already earned $178,066, with a chance to earn $500,000 more by winning the Hambletonian.</p>
        <p>The Minor brothers were brought into the horse racing business by their father, Thomas Minor, when they were youngsters growing up in the shadows of Hazel Park Raceway in Highland Park, Mich. DeWayne Minor today recalled the circumstances in which his family bought Legendary Lover K.</p>
        <p>''We saw this horse with big ears, and one thing we knew was that horses with big ears make good trotters,'' Minor said. ''When we found out he was sired by Armbro Gold, we got really interested.''</p>
        <p>Minor said he didn't think his family had a chance of getting the horse, but the bidding worked in their favor.</p>
        <p>''When the auctioneer said, 'Do I hear $3,200,' we raised our hand and the gavel went down,'' Minor said. ''To get a horse for this kind of money and take it to the ultimate race is something we never dreamed about.''</p>
