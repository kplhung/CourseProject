        <p>Seventeen-year-old Brian Hogan had never had his car inspected before, so for him it was no big deal that there was no waiting line when he showed up for his 11 a.m. appointment at the state inspection station here.</p>
        <p>But, he added: ''My mom was with me. She was shocked.''</p>
        <p>State officials would be delighted if Mr. Hogan, of Glen Rock, turns out to be part of a new generation of New Jersey drivers who never have to endure their parents' experience of waiting in line for hours to have a car inspected.</p>
        <p>The long waits, and loud complaints, began last December as the state introduced a stricter, more time-consuming emissions test to meet federal clean air standards. In the weeks following the introduction of the tests, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman suspended the new tests  while the company running them worked to end the delays, equipment breakdowns and other problems.</p>
        <p>And today was the date by which all 32 of the state's centralized inspection stations were to have the stricter test up and working smoothly. By various accounts, the deadline day was a either a breakthrough or another day of waiting and wailing.</p>
        <p>The inspection station here in Ridgewood was among the last seven  to bring back the stricter test today. Those stations, which are smaller than the rest, reopened with an appointment system intended to make sure that the long lines did not return with the tests.</p>
        <p>Most drivers said the new system worked like a charm.</p>
        <p>''I've been here a total of seven minutes, and I'm not going to argue with that,'' said Monica Gicklhorn, 41, a marketing coordinator from Mahwah.</p>
        <p>But at the Newark inspection station, Cleofe Majia, 45, of Elizabeth, said he had waited an hour after taking his boss's Volkswagen in for inspection.</p>
        <p>''It's sad,'' said Mr. Majia, a baker, who had better things to do on his lunch hour. ''Like eating,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dana Sullivan, a spokesman for the State Division of Motor Vehicles, acknowledged that the average waiting time in Newark today was about an hour. But he said it was because one of the five testing lanes there was out of service, and because the first day of the month is typically the second-busiest inspection day -- after the last -- as procrastinators line up for tests the first day their inspection stickers expire.</p>
        <p>But he said officials were pleased with the appointment system at the seven smaller stations, where 553 inspections were made by appointment. An additional 272 inspections were done on cars without appointments. Although appointments are required, the stations tried to accommodate those without them.</p>
        <p>Officials said they will wait a few weeks to determine whether changes are warranted at the appointment stations, including whether to begin turning away walk-ins.</p>
        <p>Regardless of its success, the appointment system is not being considered for the other 25 stations, Mr. Sullivan said. The average waiting time in July, he said, was nine minutes statewide.</p>
        <p>Things seemed to go most smoothly at the Ridgewood station, where all 127 inspections done by appointment required no waiting, Mr. Sullivan said, and only two drivers failed to show up. An additional 36 drivers  showed up without an appointment and had their cars inspected.</p>
        <p>Some drop-in drivers had prolonged waits at appointment stations in Westfield, Montclair and Bridgeton, where each station had one testing lane out of service for at least part of the day, Mr. Sullivan said. In Westfield, some drop-in drivers had to wait at least an hour.</p>
        <p>''This is much worse than last time,'' said Beverly Guinyard, 48, of Newark, a nurse's assistant, who had dropped in at Westfield this afternoon. ''Before they made these appointments, all I had to do was come down, drive in, they would look my car over, and I would be on my way in no more than 25 minutes.''</p>
