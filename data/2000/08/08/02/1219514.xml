        <p>Backstabbing In a Hammy Way</p>
        <p>The best man to fill in for the actor CHARLES DURNING at the opening rehearsal of the revival of GORE VIDAL's  political satire ''The Best Man'' yesterday? Mr. Vidal himself.</p>
        <p>''I'm hamming it up like nobody's business,'' he said during a midafternoon break at the Virginia Theater. ''I may get an award for overacting. I've always liked the part, though I've never acted it -- never read it aloud, even.''</p>
        <p>He said that he used ''a southwestern Lyndon Johnson accent'' for the role of the ex-president (Henry Fonda in the film version). ''He's sort of Trumanesque,'' Mr. Vidal said.</p>
        <p>The 1960 play is a relic from the pre-scripted days of politics, when the back-room dealing and the backstabbing were real and the major parties' conventions were more than pageants. But Mr. Vidal said that he had not freshened up ''The Best Man.''</p>
        <p>''I couldn't bring it up to date,'' he said. ''If it were current, it would only be about how much money they've raised. They don't talk about anything else. This is still about politics.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Durning, one of the show's producers, JEFFREY RICHARDS, said that he had had minor surgery yesterday and would join the cast in a week or two.</p>
        <p>A Rolling Stone Divulges No Assets</p>
        <p>MICK JAGGER was on the speaker phone in Family Court in Manhattan again yesterday, but this time it was hearing examiner DAVID KIRSHBLUM's turn to talk, and he was not happy that Mr. Jagger was not prepared to talk about his finances. Quoting from the film ''Jerry Maguire,'' he told Mr. Jagger, ''Show me the money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jagger did not want to submit a financial statement in a long-running child support case. In ordering him to hand over a net worth statement, Mr. Kirshblum said he could not draw up a child support order for 14-month-old LUCAS MORAD JAGGER without knowing Mr. Jagger's income and net worth. Mr. Kirshblum noted that New York State law requires that a child support order be based on the parents' ability to pay, as well as on the child's needs.</p>
        <p>Only the lawyers were in Mr. Kirshblum's courtroom yesterday. Mr. Jagger, who had testified by telephone once before, was in London. The boy's mother, LUCIANA MORAD, a lingerie model, listened to the proceedings from Brazil, where she had gone to visit relatives and look for modeling jobs, her lawyer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jagger has been fighting Ms. Morad's demands for months. When she demanded that Mr. Jagger pay $35,000 a month, he offered $5,600 a month. In May, when Mr. Jagger first asked that his financial records remain secret, Mr. Kirshblum ordered Mr. Jagger to pay $10,000 a month in temporary support.</p>
        <p>For Authenticity, Cinema Cannabis</p>
        <p>Authenticity was the watchword in NIGEL COLE's film ''Saving Grace,'' about an English orchid-grower who starts growing another cash crop in her state-of-the-art greenhouse. The marijuana plants are real.</p>
        <p>''I think we're the only film to get crown dispensation to use real marijuana plants,'' Mr. Cole said yesterday. ''I knew that there were going to be a section of the audience that would know if the plants were wrong, and I didn't want to disappoint them. We've received some very nice compliments from people who seem to know quite a lot about it. A gentleman in the Sundance festival staggered up to me and went, 'Awesome, dude.' I wouldn't know, obviously.''</p>
        <p>He said that the Ministry of Agriculture had allowed the use of hemp plants. ''One could smoke a whole roomful of the stuff without getting much more than a headache,'' he said. ''They are close cousins to the real thing.''</p>
        <p>''They had 150 plants and they arrived in a secure van every day, accompanied by two representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture,'' he said. ''At the end of the day, the plants had to be stored in a secure building. The local police station agreed to look after them. They were delighted to help and told me when I called up, 'They'll be perfectly safe with us, but you might not get all of them back.' ''</p>
