        <p>THE phone call came from Jean-Claude Baker, who runs Chez Josephine on 42nd Street. A customer had ordered a $100 bottle of wine, then announced that it was ''no good'' and demanded his money back.</p>
        <p>As a smart restaurateur, Mr. Baker gave the fellow his money even while convinced that there was nothing wrong with the wine. What, he wanted to know, was one supposed to do in such a situation?</p>
        <p>It's somewhat comforting to hear that even veteran restaurateurs get squirmy when the subject is returning a bottle of wine. Wine is intimidating to many diners, and most of the time, when they think a bottle is bad, they lack the confidence to complain and end up drinking something that should be poured down the sink.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the equation are the wine boors, who know too little to accurately judge a wine's quality but are only too eager to pronounce it inferior.</p>
        <p>(Henri Soule, who ruled over Le Pavillon in New York, dealt summarily with them: when someone complained about a perfectly good bottle, the captain would summon Mr. Soule. ''Of course we will replace it,'' he would say, adding that he found nothing wrong with the wine. The captain would then say that he had found nothing wrong with it, either. Another captain might be consulted; he, too, would find nothing wrong. By then the cocky customer would be looking for a table to crawl under.)</p>
        <p>The send-back problem has been compounded in recent years by the huge rise in the price of wine at restaurants, and the increasing number of ''serious'' wine drinkers. People who have little or no idea of what a great wine should taste like assume that anything they pay $300 a bottle for is going to be delicious. And it may well be -- to someone who has been drinking wine for years and knows what to look for in a 20-year-old Bordeaux.</p>
        <p>A newcomer to music is not expected to rhapsodize over the Bach B minor Mass. Why should a wine neophyte be expected to find joy in an austere St.-Estephe from 1970 or even 1989? It's the job of a good sommelier to see problems brewing and head them off by suggesting -- delicately -- something more appropriate. If the customer persists, he shouldn't complain afterward -- assuming there's nothing actually wrong with the wine.</p>
        <p>If a wine is truly bad -- if it's corked, for example -- a good waiter will replace it without question. In turn, most wholesalers who supply restaurant wines will take the bottle back and not charge for it.</p>
        <p>But if it's an older wine, one the restaurant may have had in its cellar for a long time, it's hard to blame the distributor -- or even the producer. Some restaurants have a policy of not replacing wines 20 years old or more, and they let customers know this when they order them.</p>
        <p>Corkiness is the most common wine problem. The cause is a mold that thrives in the bark of the cork oak tree. Proper treatment during the cork-making process eliminates it, but affected corks can and do slip through. They give wine the smell of a moldy, damp basement and impair the taste as well. Corkiness is found in both young and old wines, which is why some wineries now use only plastic corks. One small California winery, PlumpJack, made news recently by putting a screw-top cap on a $135 bottle of cabernet.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, few restaurant customers know how to identify corkiness. Good sommeliers understand. ''Too few bottles are sent back,'' said Larry Stone, the wine director of  Rubicon, a San Francisco restaurant. ''If you look at the statistics on corked wine, you know there should be more returns.''</p>
        <p>Five years ago, the problem of corked wines was serious, with some distributors and retailers claiming to find a corked bottle in almost every other 12-bottle case. Faced with mass defections to plastic corks, the cork manufacturers have improved quality considerably. But even if only 1 percent is contaminated, a busy restaurant can expect to serve one or two bad bottles a night.</p>
        <p>''What worries me,'' said Darryl Beeson, the wine director at the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, ''is the ones we don't catch.''</p>
        <p>The easiest way for a diner to handle the problem is to ask the waiter or wine steward if he or she thinks the wine is ''off'' in some way. If they think it is, they will gladly replace it, because they want the customer to be happy and because it costs the restaurant nothing to come up with a new bottle. Asking the server's advice is flattering and non-confrontational. In a good restaurant, it almost always works.</p>
        <p>If you eat in places where wine is not often served or where the staff knows little about wine, you may have a problem.</p>
        <p>How does one detect corkiness? If the wine has that moldy smell, even a faint one, it's probably corked. A friend of mine learned to recognize it by asking waiters to let him smell any corked bottles they may have retrieved that day.</p>
        <p>Other wine problems are rare or easier to deal with. If the wine is at the wrong temperature -- a red wine too warm, or a white wine too cold -- a couple of minutes in an ice bucket for the red and 10 minutes out of the ice bucket for the white will solve the  problem.</p>
        <p>Wine that has been aged prematurely by exposure to air, usually through a dried-out cork, is oxidized and should be returned. It will smell of glue or nail polish remover, and is the result of bad winemaking. But that problem is now extremely rare.</p>
        <p>Older wines, even great ones, will often throw a sediment, which collects in the bottom of the bottle. It has no effect on the wine and can be eliminated by decanting or filtering the wine through a clean strainer.</p>
        <p>Tartrate crystals, the clear granules that are occasionally found on the bottom of the cork in a bottle of white wine, are also harmless. European wine drinkers tend to shrug them off, but they make squeaky clean Americans nervous, so wine producers strive to eliminate them before the wines go to market.</p>
        <p>Then, too, there is wine that is just plain bad: for one reason or another, it has turned completely. It will smell of vinegar, and you don't have to go to wine school to recognize that, do you?</p>
