        <p>IN olden times, it was easy to separate the almost famous from the truly famous. The truly famous had cocktails named after them.</p>
        <p>Jack Rose got his the hard way, turning state's evidence against his fellow conspirators in a 1912 murder trial that lighted up the front page for months.</p>
        <p>It was a doozy. Six men pulled up outside the Metropole Hotel in Times Square and gunned down a gambling-house operator named Herman Rosenthal. It was a brazen murder, and the police moved quickly. They discovered, to their embarrassment, that the hit had been ordered by one of their own, Lt. Charles Becker, who wanted more than the 50 percent of Rosenthal's proceeds that he had been getting. Rose, a rival of Rosenthal's and the man who hired the getaway car, provided the evidence that sent Lieutenant Becker to the chair. In addition to immunity, Rose got a drink named after him, a witty blend of applejack and lemon juice, colored with a splash of grenadine.</p>
        <p>Now, he gets a restaurant, too. It's a classic, four-square, no-punches-pulled all-American joint that specializes in seafood, steaks, chops and no funny stuff. Actually, some funny stuff, but slyly worked in around the edges.</p>
        <p>In a former life, Jack Rose was B. Smith, a restaurant partly owned and fully dominated by the glamorous Barbara Smith, who took her act around the corner after breaking up with her partner, Ark Restaurants. The chef, Henry Cheung, stayed. The look and the menu have changed.</p>
        <p>Jack Rose is an artful exercise in nostalgia. The smooth, dark wood floors and brown leather booths feel like the 1930's. The huge horizontal stone fireplace, the polished driftwood accents and the rec room paneling evoke postwar suburbia with a touch of lounge. The piped-in music, on the right night, is brilliantly twisted, a ridiculous compilation that, on one visit, skipped blithely from bouncy instrumentals with a Herb Alpert flavor to a syrupy elevator-music version of ''Light My Fire'' to Mel Torme making a Turtles hit swing, even if it killed him.</p>
        <p>It was midway through Mel that I developed an irrational fondness for the place. It helped that I had ordered lucky. Scallops wrapped in good, strong bacon delivered a gutsy American flavor, and the spicy mayonnaise on the side of the plate doubled the pleasure. Pan-roasted halibut, a generous snow-white slab with a golden-brown crust, could not have been simpler, but it got the job done. Apple bread pudding was creamy on the inside, crunchy on the outside, and packed with good, tart apple chunks. I was cringing with sympathy as the Velvet Fog went full Vegas on ''I Can't See Me Loving Nobody but You,'' but the restaurant was looking very good.</p>
        <p>It fought me on subsequent visits. Lobster bisque had good depth of flavor, and the lobster meat was tender, but it was hard to overlook the graininess of the broth. Clams casino, one of the great Edsels of American cuisine, put on a brave front, topped liberally with bits of shallot, bell pepper and bacon cooked just long enough to express flavor without merging into mush. The clams, however, came out a little tough. The shrimp in the shrimp cocktail were very tough. And although Jack Rose reserves a lot of room on the menu for steaks, Peter Luger has nothing to fear. The beef covers the plate, but it makes a pretty feeble impression on the palate.</p>
        <p>Someone needs to tell the servers that they are working in a white-tablecloth restaurant, not T.G.I. Friday's. There's a lot of good will in the room, but the tone is ''Hi, guys'' and the level of attention waxes and wanes. You either feel pestered or abandoned. The modest wine list seems to be a pop quiz for some of the waiters, who look blank on hearing a selection. My heart went out to one server, who approached me, pepper mill in hand, and asked if he could add a little spice to my bisque. When I said, ''No thanks,'' he looked stricken, then retreated from the table, leaving four other diners in the lurch. I'm still trying to figure out why it took an hour to get appetizers one evening when the restaurant was half full.</p>
        <p>Just when I began to tremble with a mighty, righteous wrath, however, the kitchen would win me over. At one meal it was the oysters Rockefeller, topped with lovely fresh cress and piqued with just the right touch of Pernod. At lunch one day, it was a plump, moist chicken, roasted to a crisp mahogany, its skin still bristling with charred, smoking sprigs of rosemary and dripping with syrupy pan juices.</p>
        <p>The desserts never quite hit the spot. Aside from the bread pudding and a more than respectable creme brulee, Jack Rose drops the ball just when it should be throwing the long bomb. Banana brown betty, not much of a challenge even for a teenager, is soupy and utterly vapid, and the flourless chocolate cake, a half step short of fudge. Even the blueberry cheesecake, the sort of dessert that should be a serious prestige issue for a place like Jack Rose, seems half apologetic. The blueberries contribute blueness, but that's it. The cheesecake is only tentatively cheesy.</p>
        <p>Jack Rose seems about halfway there. Eating there is like playing the numbers. When you hit, you hit big. When you don't -- nothing. My advice to the restaurant is to imagine Jack himself sitting at a booth, fully armed and nursing a grudge. Make him happy, and you're home free.</p>
