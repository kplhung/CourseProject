        <p>Ronnie Lowenstein, acting director of the city's four-year-old Independent Budget Office, was chosen  as its director yesterday, ending a competitive process in which two financial experts were apparently passed over because of past ties to partisan politics.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lowenstein, a 49-year-old economist, succeeds Douglas A. Criscitello, who resigned in March to accept a job with PricewaterhouseCoopers. The other candidates were Carol O'Cleireacain, an economist with the Brookings Institution and former budget director under Mayor David N. Dinkins, and Ester Fuchs, a Columbia University professor who once advised Mr. Dinkins.</p>
        <p>''Ronnie Lowenstein brings unique experience to an office that has served this city well,'' said a formal statement issued late yesterday by City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, Public Advocate Mark Green and Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields, who were in charge of the selection.</p>
        <p>The agency provides budget analyses for the City Council, community boards and others in city government. Though it is supposed to be nonpartisan, it has been a frequent target for attack by the Republicans in City Hall.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Green had at first concurred with an advisory panel's endorsement of Ms. O'Cleireacain. But other officials involved in the process said Mr. Vallone had successfuly argued that Ms. O'Cleireacain and Ms. Fuchs were too willing to advocate partisan views.</p>
