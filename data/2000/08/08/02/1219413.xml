        <p>TOO often, cucumber soup is made with no more thought than ''Let's throw it in the blender with some yogurt and salt.'' To me, that's not soup but a kind of bizarre milkshake. A real cucumber soup has backbone.</p>
        <p>The usual alternative is a cooked cucumber soup, and that's fine, but I think the whole point is to avoid heat and effort while making something cooling, soothing and perfectly refreshing.</p>
        <p>For years, I was stuck on cucumber soups, cooked or from the blender, that had a smooth, creamy consistency. Then, I was served a clear chunky ice-cold soup laced with soy and with the characteristic sour, sweet, salty and spicy combination that is characteristic of so much Southeast Asian and Korean cooking. The base was chicken stock, and the very thinly sliced cucumbers were mixed with scallions, watercress and fresh herbs.</p>
        <p>After I duplicated that, it occurred to me to make a similar soup with coconut milk and the fish sauce nam pla. This variation is  equally spicy but wonderfully creamy.</p>
        <p>These soups showed me how to improve on the European-style versions that I had always made. For those, I use yogurt or sour cream, but the cucumbers are thinly sliced, not pureed, and the soup has better texture. I doubt I'll ever use the blender to make cucumber soups again.</p>
        <p>For either Asian or European cucumber soup, most of the time involved lies in chilling. I refrigerate the seeded, sliced cucumbers after they are seasoned, as their moisture is drawn out; I refrigerate the stock, yogurt or sour cream that is the soup base; and if time allows, I refrigerate the soup itself.</p>
        <p>The flavor of these soups is quite lively, not really from the cucumbers but from the load of herbs with them. Both the Asian and European variations can be augmented with other vegetables -- arugula is good -- and both work well with a few cooked shrimp or some cooked shredded chicken tossed in.</p>
        <p>ASIAN-STYLE CUCUMBER SOUP  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>2 medium cucumbers  3 tablespoons soy sauce  2 tablespoons rice or white wine vinegar  1 small chili, stemmed, seeded and minced, or  1/4 teaspoon cayenne, or to taste  2 teaspoons sugar  3 cups chicken stock, chilled</p>
        <p>1/2 cup minced scallions, both white and green parts  1 cup chopped watercress or arugula (optional)  1 cup roughly chopped cilantro, mint,  Thai basil or a combination.</p>
        <p>1. Peel cucumbers, then cut them in half lengthwise. Scoop out seeds. Slice cucumbers as thinly as possible (a mandoline is ideal for this). Mix them in a bowl with soy sauce, vinegar, chili and sugar, then refrigerate for about 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Add stock, scallions, watercress or arugula if you like, and stir. Taste and adjust seasoning. Just before serving, garnish with  herb or herbs of your choice.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>EURO-STYLE CUCUMBER SOUP  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>2 medium cucumbers  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 1/2 cups chicken stock, chilled  1 1/2 cups yogurt, preferably full-fat  2 shallots, peeled and minced, or about  1/4 cup minced red onion or scallion  1 cup chopped watercress (optional)  1 cup roughly chopped dill or mint.</p>
        <p>1. Peel cucumbers, then cut them in half lengthwise. Scoop out seeds. Slice cucumbers as thinly as possible (a mandoline is ideal for this). Mix them in a bowl with 2 teaspoons salt and refrigerate for about 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Add stock, black pepper, yogurt, shallots and watercress if you like, and stir. Taste and adjust seasoning. Just before serving the soup, garnish with the herb of your choice.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
