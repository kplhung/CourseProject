        <p>In an effort to curb attacks against livery drivers, satellite tracking systems are being tested in 40 livery cabs, enabling drivers to summon the police with a silent alarm.</p>
        <p>The system used in the 45-day pilot program enables a driver to trip a silent alarm, and dispatchers at two security companies can pinpoint the location of the cab within seconds and alert the police, officials said.</p>
        <p>The program could eventually put tracking devices in all 41,000 livery cabs in the city by the end of the year. It would cost about $8 million to $10 million to install and $5 million a year to maintain, officials said.</p>
        <p>Similar satellite-based locator systems in buses have been plagued by interference from tall buildings, but livery cabs mainly work in poor neighborhoods with lower buildings.</p>
        <p>Ten livery-cab drivers have been killed so far this year; 11 were killed in all of 1999. Late Friday, a livery driver survived an attack in which he was stabbed several times in 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Help might have reached the driver sooner than that, proponents of the tracking devices said, if his vehicle had been equipped with the device.</p>
