        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Court Ruling on Spanish Frigates Foils Modern-Day Treasure Hunt'' (front page, July 31):</p>
        <p>Spain has every right to lay claim to its sunken ships, but the Spanish are not the legitimate owners of the treasures -- gold, silver, emeralds, diamonds and other precious stones -- that these ships were carrying. The native people of Mexico, Peru, Colombia and other Latin American countries are the true owners.</p>
        <p>We must not forget that the Spanish came to the New World to take as much in gold, silver and precious stones as they could. They robbed and pillaged and in the process destroyed cultures that often surpassed their own. It is time to correct past injustices and violations of human rights committed many centuries ago.</p>
        <p>Give the ship hulls and cannons to Spain, but return the treasures to the legitimate native owners.</p>
        <p>MONICA MADARIAGA  Hartsdale, N.Y., July 31, 2000</p>
