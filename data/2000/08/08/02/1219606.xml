        <p>GREER-James Kelly, 52. Of Hollywood, FL, died June 25, 2000 at home. Born November 9, 1947 in Munich, Germany. A talented piano technician, Jim had a stellar reputation in the music community of Florida and in New York, where he spent many years learning his craft. He loved classical music, especially the words of Mahler and Bruckner. Jim's zest for life was unforgettable, as was his passion for the ideas and people he believed in. He will be sorely missed. Left behind who mourn are his three sisters plus nieces, nephews, cousins and many, many dear friends. A memorial service was held July 22 in Florida.</p>
