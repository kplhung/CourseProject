        <p>WHITE PLAINS: SPRAYING PROTEST  About 60 protesters, including environmentalists and mothers wheeling strollers, waved signs yesterday outside the Westchester County Office Building to demand an end to West Nile virus-related spraying. They complained of headaches, dizziness, nausea and other symptoms. ''I still have the metallic taste in my mouth, and so do my children,'' said Laurie Evans, 46, a Katonah resident who helped organize the protest. The county executive, Andrew J. Spano, and Dr. Joshua Lipsman, the county health commissioner, said spraying was safe and was necessary to prevent the mosquito-borne disease.</p>

        <p>STATEN ISLAND: INDICTMENT IN OFFICER DEATH  A Staten Island man involved in a high-speed police chase that ended in an officer's death was indicted yesterday on charges that include criminally negligent homicide. The police say Officer John Kelly, 31, an eight-year veteran of the force, stopped the man, Guido Tritto, 43, above, for speeding along the Staten Island Expressway, on July 17. When Officer Kelly got out of his car, Mr. Tritto, above, sped off on his motorcycle, the police said. The officer chased the motorcycle for more than a mile and then lost control of his cruiser.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: BABY RETURNED  The grandmother of a crack-addicted newborn returned the girl to the police yesterday, a day after the child's mother abducted her from St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, the police said. The maternal grandmother, whose name was not released, handed the baby to the police in East Harlem about 3:15 a.m. yesterday. The baby's mother, Carol Codrington, 29, is missing. St. Luke's is reviewing its security.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: NIKE PROTESTS SET  United Students Against Sweatshops, a group with chapters on 175 college campuses, will begin a series of demonstrations against Nike with a rally in Manhattan tomorrow. A dozen group members plan to drive  across the country in a caravan, stopping in a dozen cities to join human-rights and religious groups for protests against what they say is Nike's use of overseas sweatshops. The caravan will end in Eugene, Ore., about 100 miles south of Beaverton, where Nike has its headquarters. Nike denies using sweatshops and says it is one of the nation's leaders in improving overseas factories.</p>

        <p>EAST MEADOW: HOSPITAL LEADER ACCUSED  The chairman of Nassau County Medical Center, Eric S. Rosenblum, was accused yesterday of sexual harassment by his former secretary, Sally Pistorio McGrath. Alan M. Sanders, a lawyer representing Ms. McGrath, said that as many as five other clerical employees may join the complaint, which he plans to file in both federal and state court. A spokeswoman for the medical center acknowledged that complaints were made and said that they were being reviewed. Mr. Rosenblum declined to comment.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: WEAPONS CHARGES  A Queens man believed to have ties to neo-Nazi groups pleaded not guilty yesterday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn to charges of owning an unregistered .38-caliber pistol and two silencers. The man, Michael Sagginario, 20, was arrested on March 30 and charged with weapons violations after the police raided his home in College Point and found an AK-47 assault rifle loaded with 30 rounds of ammunition. The police also found replicas of a Nazi SS uniform, a swastika armband and stickers made by the National Alliance, a neo-Nazi group.</p>

        <p>WHITE PLAINS: SUSPECT EXTRADITED  Nine years after he fled the United States for the Dominican Republic, Carlos Grullon was extradited yesterday to face a second-degree murder charge in the death of his wife, Yolina Arcenia Camacho, a hotel chambermaid in Tarrytown, N.Y. Mr. Grullon, 36, was extradited after pressure by the police and by a United States congressman, who blocked $6 million in foreign aid until the fugitive was returned. After stops in Panama and Miami, Mr. Grullon was arraigned in Westchester and jailed in Valhalla. ''We've been waiting a long time,'' said Lt. William Herguth of the Tarrytown Police Department.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: CAR SEAT SAFETY  State troopers will help parents properly install child safety seats at 10 fitting stations, Gov. George E. Pataki announced yesterday. The stations, at state police headquarters across New York, will each be open at least once a month, by appointment.</p>

        <p>NEW ROCHELLE: 18 BEACHES CLOSED  Eighteen beaches in Westchester County on the shore of Long Island Sound will be closed at least until tomorrow because heavy rains swamped five sewage pumping stations, the county Health Department said yesterday. Rain water in the sewage system has flooded pumping stations in Larchmont, Mamaroneck and New Rochelle, and some sewage is entering the sound, diluted and chlorinated but otherwise untreated. The beaches and pumping stations will be re-evaluated tomorrow, officials said.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: TURNPIKE SHOOTING CASE  Two eyewitnesses have come forward whose testimony could clear the state troopers who fired on a van and its black and Hispanic passengers on the New Jersey Turnpike in April 1998, the troopers' lawyer asserted yesterday. The lawyer, Jack Arsenault, said he believed that because the special deputy attorney general, James J. Gerrow, notified the defense, as required by law, when he discovered evidence that could exonerate the defendants. Mr. Gerrow would not discuss the nature of the evidence.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: PRISON INQUIRY SOUGHT  Amnesty International said yesterday that it planned to ask its members around the world to call for an inquiry into allegations of abuse at Connecticut's only prison for women. Christine Doyle, research director of Amnesty International U.S.A. in New York, said prisoners have complained that male guards do pat-down searches of the female inmates and are present when those inmates undress or shower. A Correction Department spokeswoman, Christina Polce, said the agency was not aware of any recent claims of sexual abuse at York, but would investigate.</p>
