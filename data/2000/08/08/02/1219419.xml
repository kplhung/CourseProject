        <p>Jerry McLaughlin hates corporate boardrooms.</p>
        <p>That may explain why he once held a client meeting in a pet shop. Or why he holds staff powwows in a hole-in-the-wall barbecue joint called Redneck Earl's. Or why he once brought clients and staff members together on the set of ''The Sopranos.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. McLaughlin, chief executive of Branders.com, a company in Foster City, Calif., that sells promotional products, would rather meet anywhere but in a typical corporate conference room. Why? ''Those kinds of meetings are just pageantry,'' he said. ''Everybody plays the same old roles, and the whole thing is choreographed.''</p>
        <p>He is not alone in his sentiments. Dot-com executives throughout the country are shunning traditional corporate meeting spaces for more unorthodox sites, ranging from rooftops to parks to church choir lofts.</p>
        <p>Some companies select such sites for practical reasons. At InfoRocket.com, a start-up in Manhattan, space is so tight that the fast-growing company has had to convert all but one of its conference rooms into office areas for new employees. ''People are working almost on top of each other,'' said Beth Haggerty, the chief executive, ''so we hold meetings on elevators and stairwells, by the company refrigerator or wherever else we can find even a shred of privacy.''</p>
        <p>Even companies that have ample conference space are choosing to meet elsewhere, often as a way to get introverted technology workers to open up and talk frankly.</p>
        <p>At least that was Peter Kirwan's goal when he began ''fireside chats'' with employees at NaviSite, a Web-hosting company in Andover, Mass. Mr. Kirwan, the company's chief technology officer, tired of holding traditional quarterly one-on-one troubleshooting meetings with his staff in the company's sterile boardroom.</p>
        <p>''These meetings were never relaxed,'' Mr. Kirwan said. ''People didn't feel comfortable saying what was on their minds.''</p>
        <p>So, about two years ago, in a fit of desperation, Mr. Kirwan decided to don a robe and slippers and hold the meetings in front of a hastily constructed fake fireplace instead. He lighted candles on the fireplace's ''mantle'' and offered his employees hot cocoa out of teacups brought from home.</p>
        <p>''It was such an absurd setting that people felt like they could say anything,'' said Mr. Kirwan, who has conducted the sessions the same way ever since. ''All of a sudden, people were coming up with these great ideas to restructure our organization or solve a problem we were grappling with. The setting really broke down communication barriers.''</p>
        <p>Encouraging employees to unwind and speak freely is also the reason Mr. McLaughlin began holding the Branders.com staff meetings at Redneck Earl's. ''It's a dump,'' he said of the restaurant, where waitresses serve beer in Mason jars and urge patrons to eat with their hands. ''You cannot be at this place for more than five minutes without loosening up.''</p>
        <p>When that happens, Mr. McLaughlin says, staff members feel their creative juices flowing. For example, employees came up with the idea to get an authentic branding iron as a sort of company ''mascot'' while noshing on ribs at the local hotspot. And staff members have strategized there about everything from which job candidates to hire to where to move the company's 105-employee (and growing) headquarters.</p>
        <p>What is it about these quirky meeting sites that eases communication barriers?</p>
        <p>''Most meeting rooms are passive by design,'' said Dr. Tom McDonald, president of a business communications consulting firm bearing his name in San Diego. ''You've got this boardroom-style setting where one person is sitting at the head of the table spouting out stuff, and everybody else is just sitting around listening. It's very formal, so people feel it's too risky to say anything too out of the ordinary.''</p>
        <p>Nothing is formal about the meetings Larry Chiang holds as chief executive of moneyformail.com, a marketing company in Palo Alto, Calif. He holds meetings outside of his company's boardroom whenever his team has a serious problem to solve. His favorite site is a park near the office.</p>
        <p>''You've got to be off-site if you're brainstorming,'' Mr. Chiang said. ''When you're in the office, all the things you see around you trigger all the same types of responses over and over again. When you see things differently, you're going to have different types of conversations.''</p>
        <p>After a spate of resignations recently, Mr. Chiang called a park meeting. ''It was time for some frank conversation, and it wasn't going to happen in the office,'' he said. An hour later, he says, his group emerged with a new employee retention plan in place.</p>
        <p>Of course, not all dot-com companies hold meetings in unorthodox locales because they are hoping to uncover earth-shattering problems or come up with the next big idea. Some do it simply because it is fun.</p>
        <p>Sheldon Owen, vice president of business development for Toonscape, an online artist services provider based in San Diego, says his employees, who are mostly engineers, like to go up on the roof to meet. Why? ''There's a great view up there of the Coronado Bridge,'' Mr. Owen said. Other times, staff members gather in the choir loft (the company is based in an abandoned church) or the ''red room,'' so called because of its brightly colored carpet. ''We like to mix it up a little bit, have a little fun,'' he said. ''These settings fit in with our culture here.''</p>
        <p>Fun is also what Jeff Taylor, chief executive of monster.com, a job search company in Maynard, Mass., has in mind. He likes to hold monthly staff meetings in the ''monster den,'' a cavernous area in company headquarters that is strewn with game tables and bicycles. New staff members are required to introduce themselves and talk about their pets. ''At any given meeting, we'll hear about 20 different people's dogs, cats and hamsters,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''Silly? Yes, but it's supposed to be. That's the point of not meeting in a boardroom.''</p>
