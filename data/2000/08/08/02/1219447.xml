        <p>A former Coca-Cola benefits manager who has criticized the company's treatment of black workers said yesterday that he would urge those workers to retain lawyers to help them determine whether they should accept a settlement reached in June between Coke and four black employees who sued the company or file their own suits.</p>
        <p>The manager, Larry Jones, plans to hold a news conference on Friday in Atlanta. He said yesterday that he would tell his former colleagues not to wait until October, when the terms of the settlement will be announced, to assess whether they would be better off as part of the agreement, which covers all black salaried employees from 1995 to the present. Mr. Jones said he was arranging to have lawyers, other than those already involved, help employees decide what action to take. No details of the settlement have been disclosed.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, filed in April 1999 in federal court in Atlanta, contends that black employees at Coke were denied promotions, raises and other benefits because of their skin color. Coke has denied that any discrimination took place.</p>
        <p>Since March, the lawsuit has taken a complicated turn, resulting in confusion for many of the employees who would be affected by the settlement. After a dispute over the settlement's financial terms, four of the eight plaintiffs split off from the original legal team, led by Cyrus Mehri, a Washington lawyer. They signed on with Willie E. Gary, a Florida personal-injury specialist who became involved with the case in early April.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gary, who is chairman of a cable television channel that recently signed a large advertising contract with Coke, filed a $1.5 billion lawsuit in Georgia state court in June, the day the settlement of the federal suit was announced. His clients in that lawsuit are four black women who formerly worked at Coke. Mr. Gary has said that he has no conflict of interest despite Coke's business dealings with his cable channel. His co-counsel on the lawsuit is Johnnie L. Cochran, who defended O. J. Simpson at his murder trial in 1995.</p>
        <p>Many of the employees say they are unsure of how to proceed, particularly because the specifics of the settlement are still secret. ''I'm very frustrated,'' said Yvette Frierson, a former employee. ''They're telling us, 'Oh, we've reached a decision,' but they aren't giving us any details. As far as I'm concerned, they haven't reached a decision.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''It's not even a monetary thing. It's the issue of, do the right thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones has been an independent party in the situation, not aligned with Mr. Mehri or Mr. Gary, but urging Coke to settle the lawsuit all winter. In April, he organized a bus trip by black employees to the company's annual meeting in Wilmington, Del., where he called for a boycott of Coke products.</p>
        <p>''The goal is to tell people, 'We can't afford to wait,' '' Mr. Jones said yesterday, adding that he was talking with lawyers who would meet with the employees. ''The lawyers would look at their individual cases and talk to them about the pros and cons of going after individual claims.'' He added that he planned to tell his former colleagues that ''I have no reason to believe that there is anything honorable going to happen in October.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehri, reached in Washington yesterday, defended the settlement. ''We believe we have a just, honorable and enforceable agreement,'' he said. ''We are desirous and agree with Mr. Jones that the material terms should be out earlier than October. Class members do not need to, and cannot take action until the court sends out written notice of the settlement, which will be sometime this fall.'' He added that employees would have ''ample time to consult with advisers.''</p>
        <p>Since the federal lawsuit was filed, some experts have said that the individual cases are weaker by themselves than they are as a class. A Coke spokesman said yesterday that he did not know whether any details of the settlement would be released before Oct. 30, the deadline set by the judge in June.</p>
