        <p>Seated in a mock classroom in front of the stage, 20 children banged out a beat on their desks, chanted multiplication tables and rapped, ''Read, baby, read.''</p>
        <p>It was a surprising opening night symbol for the Republican National Convention, which just four years ago called for the abolition of the Department of Education and declared public schools all but beyond repair. Now, Republicans are not only embracing children and classrooms -- long icons of Democratic politics -- but are also talking about how the federal government can ensure equity in education.</p>
        <p>''There is a remarkable transformation going on,'' said James W. Guthrie, a professor of public policy at Vanderbilt University. ''We are very slowly, awkwardly, hesitantly, reluctantly, lurching toward a national system of education.''</p>
        <p>As the Republican and Democratic parties rush to respond to polls that show education is a top concern for voters, the distinctions between their positions are fading. Having chosen as their presidential candidate the governor of a state that has been among the leaders in education reform efforts in the past decade, the Republicans find themselves with a strong hand on the issue for the first time in a generation.</p>
        <p>But as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas accepts his party's nomination this week and fleshes out details of his education agenda this fall, he must grapple with an internal contradiction in his Republican philosophy: How can education be a national priority while remaining the responsibility of local governments?</p>
        <p>While Republicans in Congress have long tried to curtail federal financing for schools or provide money in block grants rather than for specific programs, Mr. Bush has proposed withholding money from any state that does not administer annual achievement tests and break out the results by students' race and class. He also wants to expand financing for Head Start and start a $5 billion national reading program.</p>
        <p>''Bush believes that his experience reforming education in Texas can be refracted on the whole country,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., an assistant secretary of education in the Reagan administration. ''In his view, the federal government is sort of like a magnifying glass -- it takes energy originating elsewhere and focuses it and concentrates it.''</p>
        <p>The shift in the Republican Party is partly a natural outgrowth of the movement by governors and business leaders to improve student achievement through rigorous standards and high-stakes testing.</p>
        <p>''This coalescing around the standards agenda has brought the parties a lot closer,'' said Susan H. Fuhrman, director of the Consortium for Policy Research in Education at the University of Pennsylvania. ''You can go from state to state and look at the reforms and be hard pressed to tell whether there was a Democrat or Republican governor.''</p>
        <p>The change was fueled by the failure of the Republicans' anti-public schools message in 1996. Shortly after that election, Mr. Bush worried aloud at a meeting of Republican governors that the Democrats' dominance on education had cost his party crucial votes among women, announcing, ''Republicans must say that we are for education.''</p>
        <p>Interest in education has only escalated since; even among the conservative delegates at the Republican convention, a quarter named education as a top priority, compared with 2 percent in 1996.</p>
        <p>With the federal government providing only about 7 cents of every dollar spent on education, a president's influence on the issue comes largely from the bully pulpit. Exhibit A was making education the theme of the convention's first night.</p>
        <p>But what is even more striking is that the Republicans chose not to talk about school choice and vouchers -- issues that separate them from the Democrats -- but to focus on standards and accountability, on which the two parties largely agree.</p>
        <p>''The last I checked, there are no Republican kids and Democratic kids,'' said David Levin, co-founder of the Knowledge is Power Program, the school in Houston whose students were spotlighted Monday at the convention. ''We're hoping that we get invited to do the Democratic convention as well.''</p>
