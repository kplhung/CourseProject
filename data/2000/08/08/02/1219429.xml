        <p>There is something new under the sun, er, moon, uh, clouds. The Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center opened its 34th season on Monday evening with its first outdoor concert, free in Damrosch Park.</p>
        <p>Actually, this is only one of many innovations Jane S. Moss, the vice president for programming of Lincoln Center, has introduced in recent years.

        <p>There is something new under the sun, er, moon, uh, clouds. The Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center opened its 34th season on Monday evening with its first outdoor concert, free in Damrosch Park.</p>
        <p>Actually, this is only one of many innovations Jane S. Moss, the vice president for programming of Lincoln Center, has introduced in recent years. A profusion of programs packed into a fast-paced four weeks has brought a welcome infusion of guest ensembles, many of them period specialists, and this year that aspect has spawned a sideline: a Bach celebration woven through the season, continuing Lincoln Center's commemoration of the 250th anniversary of Bach's death from the spring.</p>
        <p>Many is the time, over the years, that a festivalgoer has lingered on the terrace of Avery Fisher Hall at intermission, envying those enjoying a beautiful night in the plaza and hesitating to go back inside. Monday was not such a night.</p>
        <p>Rain threatened. The program was reordered to get as many pieces as possible, and the right ones, in quickly. Any substantial rainfall would force a cancellation, Ms. Moss announced from the stage, for the players, and more to the point, their valuable instruments were unprotected from the elements. In the event, although a misty drizzle persisted throughout, the rain held off until five minutes after the concert.</p>
        <p>Someone up there evidently likes Mozart, as do a lot of people down here. About 5,000 showed up, by Lincoln Center's estimate, to hear Gerard Schwarz, the festival's music director, conduct the festival orchestra, and most stayed for the duration.</p>
        <p>Exactly what they may have found to enjoy, or even heard, was often hard to judge. From a choice seat in the center, fairly close up, the amplification sounded hopelessly crude in Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' Overture, which was belatedly given pride of place. The miking and mixing seemed wildly uneven, with the trumpets brutally prominent, the strings sometimes lost. Balance and blend would have been problematic from such a perspective in any case, with the speaker complexes placed wide on either side.</p>
        <p>Matters improved slightly overall in Mozart's G Major Violin Concerto (K. 216), which was also moved up, presumably to give the young soloist, Jennifer Frautschi, a good chance of completing her Mostly Mozart debut performance. She did so, getting around the notes with excellent virtuosity and showing considerable flair in the cadenzas. More than that could hardly be gleaned from this evidence, for the aggressive amplification, even as it gradually toned down, rendered the sound of her instrument ugly and percussive. Her early attacks came like gunshots.</p>
        <p>Mozart's ''Prague'' Symphony, which followed, derives much of its rustic character and charm from its colorful use of bassoons. Amid the roiling sonorities here, they could scarcely be heard.</p>
        <p>The delayed intermission finally afforded an opportunity to retreat to seats in the rear. All that remained was Bizet's Symphony in C, left to take its meteorological chances alone. Though still far from great, the sound was unquestionably mellower and more blended here. For the first time all night, it allowed a listener to take reasonable stock of a solo effort.</p>
        <p>A good thing, for this symphony's finest inspiration comes in its oboe solos, especially in the aria-like Adagio. And Randall Ellis made gorgeous work of them here, with purposeful, expressive phrasing. The feat was all the more remarkable in light of the accumulating coolness and sogginess. Here was a saving grace to a tough evening, no matter that it might well have been worse.</p>
        <p>Wisely, Lincoln Center hedged its bets, saving the official season-opening program for last night, in climate-controlled Avery Fisher Hall. That program, with Mr. Schwarz and the orchestra, repeats this evening, still with the ''Fidelio'' Overture and the ''Prague'' Symphony in place. Tomorrow the new variety takes hold, and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, from Britain, applies period instruments to pre-Mozartean fare in Alice Tully Hall.</p>
