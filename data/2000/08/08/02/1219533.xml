        <p>Until last month, the names of the young opera singers Marijana Mijanovic and Kresimir Spicer were virtually unknown. Now they are ''the couple of the summer,'' according to the Marseille newspaper La Provence. That is partly because of their performances as Penelope and Ulysses in the new production of Monteverdi's ''Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria'' at the noted opera festival here. But it is also because they are a real-life Romeo and Juliet: she is a Serb, he is a Croat, and they live together in Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview from Beaune, France, where they had gone to sing in a concert performance of the opera, they seemed determined not to exploit the drama of their relationship. Nor, since they still must present their formal graduation recital this fall at the Sweelinck Conservatory in Amsterdam, do they wish to be prematurely compared to a better-known opera couple, the Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu and the French tenor Roberto Alagna. Yet their gifts may be comparable, and their lives are the stuff of high operatic drama.</p>
        <p>''It is a great story,'' said Mr. Spicer, 24, with boyish enthusiasm. Through different routes, both arrived in Amsterdam in 1994: he from Slavonski Brod, a mid-size Croatian industrial city, via Zagreb; she from Valjevo, a smaller, central-Serbian town, via Belgrade. They came to study with Cora Canne-Meijer, a respected Dutch teacher who draws pupils from all over Europe.</p>
        <p>His father is a mid-level factory worker, although he added that his family was rich until World War II. Her father is a highly placed engineer.</p>
        <p>They met at the height of the tension, not to say outright hatred, between Serbs and Croats. The Serbs had seized control of 30 percent of Croatia in 1991, and it was not until 1995 that the Croats could drive them out. Interethnic romantic relationships, common enough before the hostilities, had become nearly unthinkable, although Mr. Spicer and Ms. Mijanovic (his name is pronounced KRE-shi-meer SHPIT-zer; hers, Mar-YAN-a Mee-YAN-o-vich) said that in their circles at home, casual relations were not quite so fraught. Each came to Amsterdam separately: he with the help of a Dutchman who visited Croatia, bringing relief aid; she after an aunt in the Netherlands said that she could live at her house.</p>
        <p>''Before our first group class in the fall,'' Mr. Spicer recalled, ''our teacher called up and said, 'There is a student in the class, and there may be a problem: she is Serbian.' I said, 'There is no problem.' She had called Marijana and warned her, too. We spoke English in class, but I greeted her in our language. We were friends right away.''</p>
        <p>Gradually, the Romeo and Juliet parallel developed.</p>
        <p>''That was quite a bad time in our country, a strange time,'' Ms. Mijanovic, now 28, recalled in an understatement. ''Both Kresha and I were different then. Your minds are closed; you're constantly bombarded with media. Then you come outside, and you realize there is something else. This boy opened the door and he spoke my own language.''</p>
        <p>Their friendship did not flower into love at first. ''It took time, for both of us,'' Ms. Mijanovic explained. ''In that first year, there was no question that I was even going to think about him as a boyfriend.'' The two began living together in 1996, but marriage is still difficult to contemplate. While they each visit their families regularly, they have not traveled home together, let alone sung in Croatia or Yugoslavia. ''Until this year, it was not quite safe,'' she said simply.</p>
        <p>''We had quite a few problems and crises at first,'' Ms. Mijanovic continued. The two families have still not met. ''But they accepted our relationship,'' she said. ''Now, if we broke up, both families would be surprised. But marriage -- it's still a bit too complicated at this moment.''</p>
        <p>It is not just their personal drama but also their professional artistry that has captivated the operatic world; Le Monde called them ''revelations.'' It wrote of Ms. Mijanovic's ''implacable and intelligent Penelope, with a voice gravely beautiful,'' and of Mr. Spicer's ''warm voice, capable of ineffable sweetness.''</p>
        <p>She is a commanding low mezzo with a spectral stage presence that made the sometimes mopey Penelope, waiting for years for the return of her husband from the Trojan War, into the haunting figure Monteverdi intended: the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung praised her ''sure and flexible mezzo-soprano with its unique, characterful contralto timbre'' that lent her role ''a secret, strange, distant aura,'' and added that Mr. Spicer ''convinced as Ulisse with precise declamation and vocal expression.''</p>
        <p>He is a heroic tenor in the making -- a young Jon Vickers, said Eva Wagner-Pasquier, the festival's artistic adviser and a leading candidate to take over her great-grandfather's Bayreuth Festival.</p>
        <p>For singers barely known outside the circle of young artists that the opera's conductor, William Christie,  has assembled, the onslaught of attention this summer might have been overwhelming, but Ms. Mijanovic and Mr. Spicer seem in control. Mrs. Wagner-Pasquier added that they had been inundated with offers from agents and opera house managers.</p>
        <p>''There is a big fuss now,'' Ms. Mijanovic said. ''We are already overburdened by offers. They say this role is good for you, and that role is good for you. But we are very realistic people. When you come from our country and have lived what we've lived through, you become very down-to-earth. Until now, including the present, we have done everything ourselves. That's been helpful; it's very good to see how things work.'' As the elder, Ms. Mijanovic seems the more fully formed artist, one whose rich low mezzo is likely to grow in strength and assertion over the years. Right know, she is concentrating on the Baroque and Handel, although she  and Mr. Spicer recently sang Mahler's Romantic ''Das Klagende Lied'' in the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult, for a young singer,'' she said. ''We love different kinds of music; we don't like to put ourselves in a Fach,'' she added, using the operatic term for vocal category. Although she and Mr. Spicer have undertaken a joint recital tour, her heart is clearly set on opera. ''It's not just voice and musicianship, but something else: you can share yourself with your audience, and I love that,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Wagner-Pasquier was not alone in noting a kinship between Mr. Spicer and Mr. Vickers in his youth. Like Mr. Vickers, the great Canadian tenor of the 1960's and 70's, he has a voice that is baritonally anchored, with ringing high notes that drop to soft (yet always tonally sustained) quiet passages, and complex, even idiosyncratic phrasing. But while Mr. Spicer is being offered parts like the title role in ''The Tales of Hoffmann'' and Rodolfo in ''La Boheme,'' with maybe Wagner down the line, he is proceeding almost as cautiously as the notoriously cautious Mr. Vickers.</p>
        <p>''The voice grows all the time,'' Mr. Spicer said, objectifying his instrument in the time-honored manner of singers. ''When I sing an aria now after singing it a year ago, it's completely different. My brother bought the first Three Tenors record for me, and I could always sing all the top notes. When I first started with Cora Canne-Meijer, though, she wondered if I was really a heroic baritone. But every year, I get one more high note.''</p>
        <p>Although they look forward to pairings like Carmen and Don Jose or even Kundry and Parsifal, they are prepared for separate engagements. ''We would love to sing together, but we know it will not always be possible,'' Mr. Spicer said.</p>
        <p>The ''Ulisse'' production here is finished for the summer, and the couple have no recordings (a duet CD may be in the works), but curious opera lovers will be able to hear them in several presentations of ''Ulisse'' in Europe, and most likely at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the spring of 2002.</p>
        <p>Yet even as career opportunities abound, attention keeps circling back to the drama of their relationship.</p>
        <p>''I understand why people look at us in this way,'' Ms. Mijanovic said. ''But it doesn't say on our foreheads, 'Serb,' and 'Croat.' If people like the fact that we are together, I don't have anything against that. But after this interview, we don't want to speak about it. I look at Kresha not as a Croat but as the man I love.''</p>
