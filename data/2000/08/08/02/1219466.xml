        <p>The voters of Venezuela, craving radical change, have reaffirmed their confidence in Hugo Chavez, a president who promises a ''peaceful revolution.'' Mr. Chavez flattened the country's traditional political parties in elections in 1998, vowing to end the corruption and economic mismanagement that have brought a once-prosperous country to misery. His election this week under a new Constitution to a full six-year term -- the first of two, he hopes -- capped his efforts to strengthen presidential authority.

        <p>Mr. Chavez is a former army paratroop colonel who served a jail term after attempting a military coup in 1992. His charisma, identification with the poor and revolutionary rhetoric won him the presidency through the ballot box instead.

That document gives him the right to run for a second consecutive term, reduces civilian oversight of the armed forces and weakens state and municipal governments.</p>

        <p>The voters of Venezuela, craving radical change, have reaffirmed their confidence in Hugo Chavez, a president who promises a ''peaceful revolution.'' Mr. Chavez flattened the country's traditional political parties in elections in 1998, vowing to end the corruption and economic mismanagement that have brought a once-prosperous country to misery. His election this week under a new Constitution to a full six-year term -- the first of two, he hopes -- capped his efforts to strengthen presidential authority. But Venezuelans should be suspicious of how he plans to use his new powers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez is a former army paratroop colonel who served a jail term after attempting a military coup in 1992. His charisma, identification with the poor and revolutionary rhetoric won him the presidency through the ballot box instead. Once in office he established an assembly that sacked hundreds of allegedly corrupt judges, stripped Congress of its powers and rewrote the Constitution. That document gives him the right to run for a second consecutive term, reduces civilian oversight of the armed forces and weakens state and municipal governments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez's political changes have won overwhelming approval from voters in several elections and referendums, the last of which took place on Sunday. Besides Mr. Chavez's personal victory, his followers took most state and local government posts. Although they fell short of the two-thirds majority in the legislature that would in effect allow him to rule by decree, Chavez supporters still make up 60 percent of the congress. Now, after 18 months of permanent campaigning, Mr. Chavez says that at last he can begin to make real changes.</p>
        <p>But there is reason to doubt that this accumulation of power will be used to benefit Venezuela. His record on the economy has been disappointing. The price of oil, Venezuela's mainstay export, has more than tripled since he took office. But last year the economy contracted by more than 7 percent. Oil revenues, disastrously mismanaged in the past, have been no better used under Mr. Chavez. His aggressive anti-business rhetoric has helped inspire the flight of at least $8 billion to overseas banks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez also promises to fight corruption, and he has swept out of office many judges and legislators widely viewed as tainted. But some of his lieutenants have themselves fallen under suspicion. In addition, Mr. Chavez seems to choose aides not for their effectiveness but for their loyalty. His emphasis on personal authority undercuts the construction of institutions that can check official power and expose abuses -- a necessity for clean government. It would be ironic and unfortunate if the sweeping authority that Mr. Chavez has accumulated to change Venezuela prevents him from truly breaking with the past.</p>
