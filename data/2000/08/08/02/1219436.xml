        <p>By coincidence, as a federal judge ruled last week that the Internet music file-sharing company Napster was operating in violation of copyright law, EMI Music Distribution was just putting its own commercial downloading program into action.</p>
        <p>In other words, as one system of music downloading was fighting for its life (Napster appealed the judge's decision), another system was being born. But the two are far from similar. Napster is an Internet music market created by the consumer, where songs are traded for free and without rules; EMI's system is an example of an Internet music market envisaged by the major labels, where online music is bought for the same price as in CD form but with a new set of rules restricting its use. So which way do you want it?</p>
        <p>''Sony launched before us, but we're the first with significant content and significant retailers on board,'' said Richard Cottrell, the president of EMI Music Distribution. The company began trying out its downloading program through online retailers last month; Universal Music is preparing to announce its own experimental system, called Bluematter, with 60 songs available.</p>
        <p>From EMI's point of view, the system is a groundbreaking attempt to institutionalize a third legitimate music format, the digital download, in conjunction with the CD and cassette. From the viewpoint of Napster users, EMI's system is trying to impose the rules of the old regime in a world where they no longer apply. Below are comparisons of the downloading scenarios envisioned by EMI (according to memorandums supplied by an EMI recording artist's manager) and by Napster (according to the terms of service and other information on its Web site):</p>
        <p>COST: EMI writes that the suggested retail price ''for the digital products will be identical to the current physical cost structure.'' A digital single, in other words, will cost $3.99, and an album will cost $16.98 or $17.98. With Napster, of course, there is no charge for the music, though this means that, unlike with EMI's system, those who hold copyrights to the music are not paid.</p>
        <p>The manager who forwarded the EMI information wrote, ''They'll be charging full retail price for downloads of singles and full-length albums; however, they will not be providing any art or liner notes.''</p>
        <p>EMI, seeking to justify the pricing in a memorandum, said, ''Contrary to expectations, online distribution will not decrease distribution costs.'' These costs ''in fact, are much higher than traditional distribution in the physical world,'' EMI said. ''Understanding this, we will account for this when we review the experiment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cottrell said online costs included the expense of encoding the music, royalties for the encryption, maintaining and operating the hardware and additional customer service. He also said that extra content like digital liner notes and interviews would eventually be added. ''We have to change the myth that music online is free,'' he said. ''It's the same product that's sold in a store, so why should it be free online?''</p>
        <p>RESTRICTIONS: Someone who purchases a song online or album through EMI has full and unrestricted access to it, but only so long as it remains on the customer's computer hard drive. Under the EMI system, a user can copy the file onto a CD only twice. In addition, if the customer upgrades his computer or it crashes, EMI will allow him to download the same file two more times, but only within a year of the initial download. The final rule is that the file can be transferred onto a portable digital-music player only three times.</p>
        <p>Unlike Napster, which has no such restrictions and does not enforce the few rules it does have (most of which relate to unauthorized distribution of copyrighted music), the EMI rules are encoded into the file being downloaded so that they can be circumvented only through hacking.</p>
        <p>FORMAT AND SELECTION: EMI encodes its music using secure formats, specifically Windows Media Audio 4.0 and Liquid Audio 5.0. On Napster, the trade is in MP3 files, which are exchanged without rules and restrictions. EMI, Mr. Cottrell said, has a company policy against the use of MP3 files.</p>
        <p>While the Napster universe of music is immense, with music by almost any mainstream, semipopular and even semi-obscure act available, EMI's service for now contains only about 100 albums and 40 singles. Mr. Cottrell said the catalog would be expanded every month. This month, he continued, the label will start making some new recordings available online simultaneously with their in-store release. In addition, he said, EMI plans to offer out-of-print recordings through Internet retailers that have never been released on CD.</p>
        <p>The problem with EMI's approach, said Jaron Lanier, a musician and technology expert, is that the industry only seems to see the situation in black and white. Its thinking, he said, ''is that either you have to accept fascism on the Internet or put up with anarchism where anything goes.'' The future of downloading may be somewhere in the gray area, a place, he said, where fans are trusted instead of monitored.</p>
        <p>Expensive Words</p>
        <p>Think of it as another nail hammered into the coffin of rock 'n' roll: a band is being refused payment for a concert last month because it mocked a corporate sponsor from the stage. The event was the Hard Rock Cafe Rockfest, which took place outside Chicago on July 22 and attracted 50,000 to 100,000 fans (depending on whose estimates you believe) to hear Kid Rock, Third Eye Blind, Guster and others.</p>
        <p>Dismayed by commercials broadcast from onstage screens and people in gorilla suits throwing T-shirts advertising Oldsmobiles into the audience, the Guster singer, Ryan Miller, began making fun of Oldsmobile, which presented the concert, during his set. Mostly what he did was derisively chant the company's slogan, ''This is not your father's Oldsmobile.'' But that was enough for the concert's promoters. The band was supposed to be paid $10,000. It received half the money beforehand, but afterward promoters would not pay the rest.</p>
        <p>''He was pretty much doing what he always does, which is make fun of his surroundings,'' said Brian Rosenworcel, Guster's drummer, of his singer's antics. But what happened afterward, he continued, ''was strange because legally we fulfilled our obligation and played the show, though I'm not surprised to see a corporation lashing out at a band because they had their ego bruised.''</p>
        <p>Michele Bernstein, the national manager of artist relations and marketing for Hard Rock Cafe International, said in a statement: ''Guster was hired to play the Hard Rock Cafe Rockfest presented by Oldsmobile Alero. If they were in any way confused as to the nature of the show and who was paying their fee, they should speak to their management.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenworcel said that Guster had no plans to file legal claims for the rest of the payment. But, he added, ''I think that we're done playing the overcommercialized festivals.''</p>
