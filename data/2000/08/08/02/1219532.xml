        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your July 26 editorial ''Driving Up Drug Prices'' urges a case-by-case approach to the complex questions surrounding patent laws, food and drug laws, and competition policy expressed in the Hatch-Waxman Act. You then suggest that Andrx Pharmaceuticals intended to delay generic competition by entering into an agreement in connection with its continuing patent infringement litigation. We did not, and in fact, as a result of the agreement, consumers got Andrx's lower-priced generic product faster than they would have otherwise.</p>

        <p>Andrx is doing everything it can to achieve the objectives of the Hatch-Waxman Act, including spending millions of dollars annually in litigation to determine whether it has the right to get its lower-priced products to consumers notwithstanding the brand's patents. To solve the real problem, the law needs to reduce the risks faced by marketing a generic while patent litigation is continuing.</p>
