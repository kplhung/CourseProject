        <p>A civil lawsuit against the former leader of the Bosnian Serbs began in a federal courtroom in Manhattan yesterday with a witness fainting on the stand as she described her captivity, rape and torture during the Balkans conflict in the summer and fall of 1992.</p>
        <p>The woman, a Bosnian Muslim, told of being dragged from her house by soldiers, including a former neighbor from her town in northern Bosnia.</p>
        <p>She said the men, who wore photographs of the Bosnian leader, Radovan Karadzic, told her she was being singled out because she was a Muslim. They took her and her two young children to a mountainside shack, she said, where they locked her inside and repeatedly raped her.</p>
        <p>''I could not resist, I could not fight against them,'' the witness, a woman identified as N. S., testified. ''I could not resist because the others were holding me while my children were watching.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Karadzic has been indicted for genocide by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague but has not been apprehended and is believed to be in hiding in Bosnia. Although neither he nor his lawyers appeared in the courtroom yesterday, they submitted documents vigorously contesting the right to hold a civil trial in the United States for offenses the plaintiffs claim were committed overseas.</p>
        <p>The woman testified that her abductors ''started slapping me in the face, saying there was nothing and no one to save me, ever.'' She added:  ''It was their state and they could do as they pleased. There was no way for me to escape.''</p>
        <p>While tales of atrocities have become familiar in accounts of the  conflicts during the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the testimony yesterday was among the first heard on the subject by American jurors.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, which was filed in 1993 on behalf of a group of women and children, seeks millions of dollars in damages from Dr. Karadzic, who the plaintiffs say masterminded a campaign of genocide, rape and torture in the area in the early 1990's.  Lawyers for the women said that in addition to experts and witnesses to more widespread violence, 11 witnesses were expected to testify to attacks made against them.</p>
        <p>In the last seven years, the case has moved from the District Court to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, as lawyers for both sides argued whether American courts could exercise jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>The courts ruled that the case could be brought in the United States under federal laws against torture, and under a 1789 law allowing damage claims made for offenses against ''the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.''</p>
        <p>In June, Judge Peter K. Leisure of the United States District Court entered a default judgment in the women's favor.</p>
        <p>Maria T. Vullo, one of the lawyers representing the women, said yesterday that although ''the case obviously has an important message in it,'' her clients fully intended to collect damages from Dr. Karadzic's assets.</p>
        <p>The trial in Manhattan, which is expected to last about two weeks, will determine the amount of money he will be ordered to pay.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Dr. Karadzic did not return telephone calls. But in a letter to the court written in 1997, Dr. Karadzic rejected the American courts' ability to sit in judgment on his actions.</p>
        <p>''Can you really hope to find truth, or do justice, or protect rights of people in distant nations?'' Dr. Karadzic wrote. ''Do you really believe that attaching a U.S. dollar sign to human tragedy around the world by empty judgments in uncontested lawsuits is a step toward peace or justice?''</p>
        <p>In the letter, Dr. Karadzic said he would ''have to look to history, or to courts with real access to the events, the witnesses, documents and the parties for my vindication.''</p>
        <p>The State Department has offered $5 million for information on the whereabouts of Dr. Karadzic and several other wartime leaders accused by the war crimes tribunal.</p>
