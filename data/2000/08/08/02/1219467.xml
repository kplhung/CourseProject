        <p>A United States military court in Germany sentenced an American soldier today to life in prison without parole for the murder of an 11-year-old Kosovo Albanian girl.</p>
        <p>The soldier, Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi, 36, who was sent to Kosovo last summer with the Third Battalion of the 504th Parachute Infantry, pleaded guilty last week to sodomizing and murdering the young girl, Merita Shabiu, while he was on peacekeeping duty in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>His sentence is the most severe available to an American military court holding a trial in Germany, where the death penalty does not exist. It was handed down after the girl's father and mother had provided moving testimony about their own suffering and their daughter's.</p>
        <p>''My daughter welcomed the peacekeepers,'' the father, Hamdi Shabiu, said. ''She was very happy because she thought they had come to protect us. How do you do this to someone? He massacred my daughter.''</p>
        <p>Her bruised and slashed body was found in the snow on Jan. 13 outside Vitina, where Sergeant Ronghi's company was based. Sergeant Ronghi has said he sodomized and murdered Merita in an abandoned building in Vitina, before stuffing her body in a plastic bag and dumping it in the woods.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what went wrong that day,'' he said in court today, standing before a jury of six uniformed Army officers. ''I am still trying to look for answers myself to that question.''</p>
        <p>Sergeant Ronghi had a previously impeccable record.</p>
        <p>Until shortly before the trial -- and despite compelling evidence against him from another soldier in the company who witnessed his removing the body -- Sergeant Ronghi had insisted that he was not guilty and was being framed as ''a bad guy.'' But on Friday, he abruptly changed his plea to guilty.</p>
        <p>There was also evidence that he had planned the killing. A prosecutor, Capt. Alton Gwaltney, citing testimony from a fellow soldier, said Sergeant Ronghi had told other soldiers that he had a plan to ''grab a little girl and rape her, but would have to kill her to get away with it and would blame the Serbs.''</p>
        <p>The girl's mother, Remize Shabiu, wept as details of the murder were read out in court. ''Merita is not the only one who died,'' Ms. Shabiu said. ''We all died. We are half-people now.''</p>
        <p>The couple have five other children.</p>
        <p>In its sentence, the panel accepted the prosecution argument that the crime amounted to cold-blooded murder and an ignoble betrayal of a mission to maintain security in a province bitterly divided between Serbs and Albanians. The panel ignored defense arguments that the sergeant should be given some leniency because his unit was under extreme psychological pressure in Vitina.</p>
        <p>Eastern Kosovo, where American soldiers are situated, was supposed to be relatively safe, far from the traditional front lines between the Serbs and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the insurgent Albanian movement. But the area proved to be as unstable as the rest of the province and quickly became a haven for smuggling and drug trafficking.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Ronghi was born in Niles, Ohio, the third of four children. He is divorced. He joined the Army in 1988, serving in Egypt, Haiti and the gulf war. By his arrival in Kosovo in late summer 1999, he had risen to staff sergeant in Company A of his infantry regiment. In Kosovo, he led about 12 soldiers who controlled checkpoints and patrolled streets.</p>
        <p>His company earned a reputation for aggressiveness. In late March, after their return home to Fort Bragg, N.C., five of its soldiers were disciplined for mistreating civilians on Jan. 9 and 10, a few days before Merita's murder.</p>
        <p>The defense for Sergeant Ronghi alluded to those incidents, suggesting that a ''negative command climate'' had developed in a highly unstable situation. But the evidence that he had carefully planned the killing proved more compelling.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Ronghi, who said he regretted what he had done and the disgrace that he had brought on the Army, is to serve his sentence in the United States. Under its terms, he has no possibility of parole.</p>
