        <p>The Softbank Corporation, one of the world's biggest investors in Internet start-up companies, abandoned a plan today to sell shares in five subsidiaries.</p>
        <p>Softbank said it made the decision because of potentially costly tax consequences from such sales. But there was speculation that Softbank abandoned the plan partly because its own share price has fallen more than 70 percent this year and a spinoff might have made the company even less attractive to shareholders.</p>
        <p>The plan had been criticized by investors and analysts, who argued that it would further muddy Softbank's accounting, confuse investors and create conflicts of interest between the company and the subsidiaries. ''I think they realized they were going to have trouble selling these companies, especially for the price they were looking for,'' said Thomas Rhodes, an Internet analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>The subsidiaries are basically clusters of Softbank investments in electronic commerce, publishing, on-line financial services and software.</p>
        <p>Speculation was that Softbank had intended to use the proceeds of the sale to finance its portion of the purchase of the Nippon Credit Bank, an insolvent bank taken over by the government during the height of the Japanese financial crisis of 1998.</p>
        <p>Softbank, together with the Orix Corporation and the Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company, plans to spend 80 billion yen, or $730.6 million at current exchange rates, for an 80 percent stake in the bank.</p>
        <p>Softbank must sell part of its Internet empire, which spans investments in 400 companies, to finance its share of the purchase. Largely a giant venture capital fund, it has almost no revenue. In the past, it has sold bits of investments in Yahoo, Trend Micro and Softbank Technology to raise money to finance its operations and make further investments.</p>
        <p>The bank deal has come under heavy criticism from politicians, who object to what they consider overly favorable terms for the buyers. Last week, the government postponed the sale of the bank, which was to have been concluded today, by one month in hopes of increasing political and public support. Softbank and its partners had threatened to walk away if the government tried to renegotiate the contract.</p>
        <p>Today, Hideyuki Aizawa, the newly appointed head of the Financial Reconstruction Commission, the agency responsible for overhauling the banking system, said the deal would go through as originally planned. ''It's better to keep the existing policy toward the N.C.B. deal,'' he said. ''We basically won't change the contract.''</p>
        <p>His comment may have contributed to the first rise in the benchmark Nikkei stock index in five sessions. Investors have been worried that the Japanese government has lost its appetite for financial reform, but Mr. Aizawa's commitment to completing the sale of Nippon Credit Bank under the original terms, despite his personal objections to allowing companies other than banks into the banking industry, seemed aimed at alleviating those concerns.</p>
