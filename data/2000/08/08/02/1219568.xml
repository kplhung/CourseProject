        <p>The annual Patrick Could Be Traded scuttlebutt is making the rounds, especially with the litany of high-profile players changing teams this summer. But Scott Layden, the Knicks' general manager, reiterated yesterday what the franchise has felt all along: If Ewing goes, the Knicks go downhill.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to address any rumors,'' Layden said. ''But as far as Patrick is concerned, we still stand by our comments and feelings about him. He's the captain of our team, and a vital and important part of our team.</p>
        <p>''He's a guy that has meant so much to this franchise. We think in order for us to win and move on in the playoffs, he needs to be part of this team.''</p>
        <p>Layden spoke during a conference call announcing that the reserve forward Kurt Thomas had signed a multiyear contract extension; terms weren't given. It was the first day N.B.A. free agents could sign contracts.</p>
        <p>Although Layden does not rule out the team's desire to improve its roster, his options are dwindling. The Knicks don't want to move either Latrell Sprewell or Allan Houston, and they will probably keep Charlie Ward. Interest in Larry Johnson, based on his contract and health, is almost infinitesimal. That leaves Marcus Camby and Chris Childs as perhaps the only trade bait.</p>
        <p>''Well, I think that what we need to do is worry about the Knicks, and do the best job we can,'' Layden said in response to other teams like Miami, Charlotte and Orlando making significant moves in the off-season.</p>
        <p>The Knicks still have two salary slots they could fill, including the $2.25 midlevel exception. The team can also use its $1.2 million exception for another player, or use that exception next year. Unless the Boston free agent Danny Fortson, Washington's Aaron Williams or a player of that stature signs with the Knicks, the postseason cries for a decent rebounder may go for naught.</p>
        <p>''Certainly that was a theme after last season, that we needed to address the rebounding,'' Layden said. ''We helped in that area by getting Erick Strickland.'' He was referring to the multidimensional guard the Knicks got from Dallas on draft day. Talking about rebounding, Layden added: ''It's something we've got to be cognizant of to get better in. We need to get better.''</p>
        <p>Layden called the signing of Thomas ''a very important one for our team.'' He then cautiously knocked down the notion that Ewing was being shopped and would soon be part of a multiplayer deal. ''We like this team a lot,'' Layden said. ''They've gone very far in the playoffs. It's not complete. But one of the strengths of our rosters, guys can play a number of positions.</p>
        <p>Childs is still on the block. The Knicks would move Camby if the right player came along, but they are not persuaded that they would not be better off keeping the 7-footer, whose intangibles helped lead the Knicks to the 1999 N.B.A. finals.</p>
        <p>Many of his teammates do not want to see him go, either. Houston, responding to a question about whether moving Camby for Portland's Brian Grant would be a wise trade, said Camby's contributions should not be overlooked.</p>
        <p>''I think every team has to evaluate where they are and what they have to do,'' Houston said yesterday. ''Obviously, the Knicks feel this is something that they need. Personally, I believe Marcus could make a huge difference, and he has been working extremely hard. So I think that is one of the key components that people will forget about, what a difference Marcus can make.''</p>
        <p>Grant was in Cincinnati yesterday, meeting with Cleveland General Manager Jim Paxon and Coach Randy Wittman. The Cavaliers were trying to persuade Grant to agree to a sign-and-trade deal for Shawn Kemp. Grant has said he wanted to play in New York, but a three-team deal involving the Knicks, Cavaliers and Trail Blazers is looking less likely.</p>
