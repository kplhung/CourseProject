        <p>For home buyers in New York City, buying property often means dealing with a confusing array of real estate agencies, jumping from broker to broker in an exhaustive search to find the perfect home at the right price.</p>
        <p>But now the city's three largest real estate brokerage firms have decided to try to streamline the process by forcing brokers to end the decades-old practice in which many have kept real estate listings to themselves. Instead, they will begin sharing their listings by combining them in one huge database that home buyers and renters can view on the Internet.</p>
        <p>In doing so, the city's real estate industry is catching up with the way things are done in the rest of the country, where shared listings are the usual way of doing business. Real estate agents call the change nothing less than revolutionary for customers in the New York market.</p>
        <p>''For our consumer to have to go to 20 sites to collect all the information does not make any sense,'' said JoAnne Kennedy, president of Coldwell Banker Hunt-Kennedy, which has three offices in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn Heights. ''Now the buyer can be guaranteed that they will see everything and the seller will get the widest possible audience, which is how they get the best price.''</p>
        <p>Under the plan, by Jan. 1, 2001, the three  brokerage firms -- the Corcoran Group, Douglas Elliman and the Halstead Property Company -- will provide brokers and customers access through Web sites. Listings will be updated automatically as brokers enter new data about homes from their personal computers.</p>
        <p>All told, the three brokerage firms hold an estimated 50 percent of the listings in Manhattan. And they have plans in the coming days to invite the other residential real estate companies in New York City to join the system.</p>
        <p>In all likelihood, it will be difficult for brokers not using the system to compete once consumers get used to having access to the combined listings, real estate industry officials said.</p>
        <p>Currently, brokerage companies selectively exchange listings in a process called co-broking, in which firms share some of their listings, and divide up the commissions when a home is sold. But the temptation for agents is to try to hold on to new listings and sell the home themselves to retain the entire commission, usually 6 percent of the selling price.</p>
        <p>Debra Beck, the executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said that with the new system, brokers were likely to be troubled by the ''loss of some control of the listings'' and ready access to their properties by competing agents.</p>
        <p>''This is more of an equalizing force in that it may eliminate that individual broker's advantage,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Some brokers, co-op boards and individual sellers have objected to the widespread collection and dissemination of the most high-end and exclusive listings; but executives at the brokerage firms said they hoped to win them over with the new system. And for agents at the brokerage firms involved, there is an added incentive: brokers could be punished for not sharing their listings.</p>
        <p>Industry experts said the current plan was likely to be successful because it was being designed, advocated and initially controlled by Manhattan's three largest brokerage firms. Furthermore, Douglas Elliman and Corcoran have agreed to spend $2 million on the new system.</p>
        <p>Real estate industry officials predicted that if the new system succeeded, the database would complete a transformation of Manhattan's once cloistered and guarded real estate industry into one known for openness and innovation.</p>
        <p>''This has been a complicated issue for many of us,'' said Frederick W. Peters, the president of Ashforth Warburg. ''We have had a franchise on this wonderful lucrative marketplace.''</p>
        <p>''But the level of inconvenience it was causing and costing all of us was too high,'' he said. ''This gives us the opportunity of creating a joint Web site that will allow us to compete with Internet-based real estate companies. It gives us powerful leverage on the market.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Peters, whose brokerage firm handles luxury properties, said he did ''not fear losing my market share'' because some people will always want specialized attention that smaller brokerage firms offer.</p>
        <p>''It is like the difference between buying at Bloomindale's instead of a Chanel boutique,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some of the smaller brokerage firms have already begun to take a beating as the larger houses have moved north of 96th Street in Manhattan and into other boroughs.</p>
        <p>They may have a hard time competing without joining the service. Nevertheless, officials at several smaller brokerage firms expressed concern about Halstead, Douglas Elliman and Corcoran laying the foundation for the service without their initial imput.</p>
        <p>But Clark Halstead, the founder and managing partner of the Halstead Property Company, said that the companies decided to start the program together because ''we had the market share, therefore we had to exert leadership on the issue.''</p>
