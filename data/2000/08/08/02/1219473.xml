        <p>General Motors and DaimlerChrysler said today that their sales fell in July, leaving both automakers unable to reduce their bloated inventories of unsold minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. But Ford and foreign automakers announced strong sales last month and balanced inventories.</p>
        <p>Overall industry sales were very strong. While they did not quite match the torrid pace early this year, they were still brisk enough to suggest that consumer spending remained a powerful force in the American economy during July.</p>
        <p>''There are some signs of moderation, although the industry is running at a healthy pace,'' said Bill Lovejoy, G.M.'s group vice president for North American vehicle sales, service and marketing.</p>
        <p>Mark M. Cornelius, an auto statistician in West Olive, Mich., calculated this evening that sales rose 2.1 percent from a year ago, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.2 million cars and light trucks. He used estimates for sales of Mazda, the only automaker not reporting today. The auto industry sold 17 million vehicles last year, its best ever.</p>
        <p>General Motors posted a 2.6 percent drop in sales for July from its record level a year earlier, as a 22.8 percent jump in sales of small Saturn cars failed to offset weak sales of minivans, small pickup trucks and large sport utility vehicles. Paul Ballew, G.M.'s sales analysis director, blamed inadequate factory production for the weaker sales of large sport utilities.</p>
        <p>The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler said sales fell 12.2 percent in July, dragged heavily by a 29 percent plunge in sales of minivans, a market segment that Chrysler essentially invented in 1983 and has dominated since. Chrysler will introduce redesigned minivans later this month and in early September, and customers have proved loath to buy the older models, despite increasingly lavish rebates.</p>
        <p>Jeep sales dropped 15 percent and sales of Dodge Durango large sport utility trucks fell 3 percent. But Americans continued to snap up Chrysler PT Cruiser small vans as fast as the company could build them.</p>
        <p>During most of the year, automakers seek to keep a 60-day inventory of vehicles at dealerships and on the way to dealerships. But at the end of July, when they are phasing out old models, they would prefer somewhat smaller inventories of 55 to 58 days.</p>
        <p>G.M. said late this afternoon that its supply of unsold cars and light trucks equaled 68 days of sales; Chrysler said that it had a 78-day supply. Both automakers said that they did not have separate inventory figures today for cars and for light trucks, which encompasses minivans, sport utilities and pickups.</p>
        <p>G.M. and Chrysler both had very large inventories of light trucks and small numbers of cars at the end of June. Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto analyst at Lehman Brothers, said that the two companies' sales and production figures in July suggested that this pattern had persisted, particularly at G.M., and that the companies' overall inventory figures masked huge backlogs of minivans, sport utilities and pickups.</p>
        <p>''Their car inventory is too low, but you don't make any money on cars, and their light truck inventory is too high, and you make money on light trucks,'' he said. ''You just can't go forever building more than you sell.''</p>
        <p>Chrysler officials acknowledged that their large inventories reflected an enormous supply of minivans. That situation stems at least partly from the company's determination not to run out of minivans this year as it did in 1995 when it shut its two minivan factories for nearly three months to retool them for a new generation. Chrysler ran short of minivans, posted a huge quarterly loss and watched as many loyal customers deserted to rival brands.</p>
        <p>This time, Chrysler built lots of extra minivans in the spring and figured out a way to convert one factory over to the new model in two weeks this summer and the other in seven weeks.</p>
        <p>The first factory is now in production and cranking out the new minivans quickly, but the old models are selling slowly. James Holden, Chrysler's chief executive, said last week that discounts would be needed to dispose of the older models.</p>
        <p>G.M.'s situation is more complicated. In a telephone conference call with reporters this afternoon, Mr. Ballew, the sales analysis director, dismissed widespread rumors in Detroit that G.M. was about to slow output at some factories because of excessive inventories. The automaker's supply of vehicles looks large only in comparison with last summer, when the company was short of many models, he said. He added that the industry's sales might slow slightly next year with weaker economic growth. Gas prices have had little effect on sales, Mr. Ballew said.</p>
        <p>Ford announced today that its sales inched up 0.6 percent from an extremely strong performance a year ago. The company had roughly a 50-day supply of cars and about a 60-day supply of light trucks at the end of July, said George Pipas, a market analyst at Ford.</p>
        <p>Some foreign automakers fared better in July. Honda had its best month ever in the American market as sales rose 11.6 percent, led by strong results for the Civic compact car, the Odyssey minivan and the CR-V small sport utility vehicle. Mitsubishi's sales jumped 28.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Volkswagen's sales climbed 4.8 percent, while Toyota's sales crept up 1 percent and Nissan's sales edged up 0.2 percent.</p>
