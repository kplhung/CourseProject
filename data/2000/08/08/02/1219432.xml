        <p>When the nation's largest publisher, Random House, took up new temporary quarters in Manhattan this summer, it suddenly became clear how random is its system for preserving a rich literary legacy that embraces authors from William Faulkner to Toni Morrison.</p>
        <p>From a secret closet behind the 11th-floor stairwell of Random House's former offices on East 50th Street emerged a missing trove of more than 50 photographs and notes that had been the subject of an intensive executive search.</p>
        <p>The treasures ranged from a picture of a brooding Gertrude Stein with a handwritten tribute to her publishers to a portrait of a jaunty William Faulkner suited up for fox-hunting with a red coat and a riding crop. (''To Random House. Love and Kisses. Tally Ho! William Faulkner.'') The search also unearthed a framed copy of handwritten pages from Eugene O'Neill's ''Mourning Becomes Electra,'' along with a photograph of the playwright in smoking jacket and floppy kerchief.</p>
        <p>''We were so happy when we found them,'' said Carol Schneider, Random House's vice president for publicity.''I must have asked 13 people where they were, and everybody referred me to somebody else.''</p>
        <p>In the near future the company's spotty method of preservation will become more systematic, with plans under way to find space outside Manhattan for a building to house Random House's archives of books, manuscripts and correspondence between authors and editors.</p>
        <p>''When you think about it, you wonder why it's never been done,'' said Peter Olson, the chief executive of Random House, who is also behind an effort to construct a 25,000-square-foot building in England to house the archives of Random House there. ''We're in a business that has to reinvent itself every year and with a front list of new titles that's consuming. Even with a talented group of editors, it makes it challenging for them to think about filing their books and their papers from last year.''</p>
        <p>Now some of Random House's books and first editions that date back to the beginning of the 20th century are housed in one of its warehouses in Westminster, Md. Other books and letters have been preserved at the University of Texas and at Columbia University, which got its last shipment of material in 1997.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Olson noted that Random House did not have an organized system for saving its materials. ''There wasn't a home for all these things,'' he said. ''There wasn't a clear place where you knew where the correspondence would go.''</p>
        <p>The flotsam of paper and manuscripts could influence the next generation of books. Gerald Clarke, the author of a newly published Random House biography, ''Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland,'' credits a discovery he made in the Random House archives at Columbia University for new information included in his work.</p>
        <p>As he approached the end of his research in 1998, he has said in interviews, he found what he called ''pure gold,'' a 68-page manuscript of Judy Garland's unfinished autobiography that had been lying unread for years. From that draft he obtained her  bleak account of sexual pressures from studio executives while she was a teenager working for MGM.</p>
        <p>Several years ago, Ms. Schneider and another Random House employee were looking through the Columbia University archives for examples of Modern Library dust jackets. But during that search they happened to leaf through the letters of Bennett Cerf, the founder of Random House. His exchanges with prominent authors and suppliers were so entertaining that Random House considered publishing a book of the correspondence, Ms. Schneider said.</p>
        <p>Random House is still in the early stages of planning archives in the United States and has not yet determined the precise location or cost, Mr. Olson said. He said that his goal was to catalog material and to house it in a building that was within commuting distance of Manhattan and that was properly air-conditioned and ventilated.</p>
        <p>No other major publishing house has tried such a formal approach. Simon &amp; Schuster, the trade publisher, maintains an in-house library of its first editions and keeps its editorial files in storage. Each day employees at Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux walk by the files that have multiplied on the 10th floor of its Union Square offices. Some of its more important papers have been sold to the New York Public Library, but recently the publisher has taken steps to rent storage space to clear room in its hallways.</p>
        <p>Mr. Olson said that Random House's planned warehouse would not be a museum open to the public. Instead, he described it as a ''working archive'' that would be open to scholars, biographers, researchers and Random House employees.</p>
        <p>''We're really just pulling together our plans at Random House at this point,'' he said. ''A lot of it is in the warehouse and hasn't been looked at for years.''</p>
        <p>The photographs that were discovered in the Random House move to new quarters on Park Avenue may eventually be stored in the archives. But for now, Ms. Schneider said, the literary finds will once again see the light -- albeit the obscurity of a corporate conference room.</p>
