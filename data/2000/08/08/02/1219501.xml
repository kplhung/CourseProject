        <p>At a breakfast on Monday for Wyoming's delegates to the Republican National Convention here, Dick Cheney looked uneasy when it came time to pose for a photograph with the crowd from his home state.</p>
        <p>When the group burst into a rousing rendition of ''Ragtime Cowboy Joe,'' the University of Wyoming fight song, everyone reveled in the pageantry. Everyone, that is, except Mr. Cheney, who sat stiff and silent in the front row, a pained smile fixed on his face.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, 59, has lived in the bubble of public life for more than a quarter-century, as White House chief of staff, congressman and secretary of defense. He presided over the military in the Persian Gulf war in 1991. But he has not run for office since 1988, in his last race for re-election as Wyoming's lone House member. As Gov. George W. Bush's running mate, he is in many ways a neophyte on the national campaign trail.</p>
        <p>He seems utterly at ease giving short, serious speeches to crowds, and fielding searing political line drives from Sunday television talk show hosts. But give him a crowd and a rope line, and Mr. Cheney rushes through, visibly relieved when he's finished. Give him a bank of television cameras at a campaign rally, and he looks the other way.</p>
        <p>''Dick did fine tonight, and he'll get better,'' Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania said after Mr. Cheney's four-minute speech at his debut rally on Sunday, a well-received, if sober, recitation of his conservative record and the campaign's central themes. ''Remember, Dick has not been on the political stump in a long, long time, and like everything else, he'll get into a rhythm.''</p>
        <p>Delegates here, who like Mr. Cheney are more conservative than most registered Republicans, almost universally applaud his selection, more for bringing sure-footed experience to the ticket than any campaign sizzle.</p>
        <p>''I'm not bouncing up and down about Cheney,'' said Bill Caster, a commissioner in New Hanover County, N.C., and a Republican delegate, ''but sometimes substance is better than show.''</p>
        <p>Even Governor Bush has gently poked fun at his partner's dry campaign style, but he continues to praise Mr. Cheney and brags that picking him was a ''presidential decision.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Bush campaign advisers argue that vice presidents do not need to be galvanizing campaign figures. Jack F. Kemp, for example, was supposed to jazz up Bob Dole's lagging campaign in 1996, but it made no difference. So with the Secretary, as many campaign aides call Mr. Cheney, preparing to give the speech of his life to the convention on Wednesday night, the Bush camp's strategy has been to let Cheney be Cheney, with a few tweaks here and there.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, for example, the Bush campaign dispatched two top policy aides, Joshua Bolten and Gary Ebson, to Mr. Cheney's Dallas home to brief him on Mr. Bush's position on issues like taxes, oil policy, health care and the environment. Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush have talked regularly by phone, aides said, as the governor continues his five-day road trip to the convention.</p>
        <p>''A man of Secretary Cheney's stature and experience came here prepared,'' said a Bush campaign spokesman, Ari Fleischer.</p>
        <p>Prepared to champion Mr. Bush's policies, perhaps, but advisers conceded that no one anticipated that Mr. Cheney would spend much of his week defending his voting record in Congress.</p>
        <p>And that has set off some backbiting among Bush loyalists. One prominent Republican strategist said that the rollout of Mr. Cheney had been disappointing, that whatever spontaneous excitement there might have been was drained away when news of Mr. Cheney's selection leaked out days in advance.</p>
        <p>''Cheney should have come into the convention with a bang,'' the adviser said. ''Instead, it was a whimper by the time he got here. This showed a big flaw in the campaign -- they couldn't see or predict how the national press corps would react and what the focus would be. I don't think it matters right now, but that vulnerability could matter big time after Labor Day.''</p>
        <p>It might matter right now, if a small focus group conducted around Sunday's talk shows by a Republican pollster, Frank Luntz, is any indication. ''Some of the Cheney quotes raised some eyebrows among swing voters,'' Mr. Luntz said.</p>
        <p>The same concerns about Mr. Cheney's votes against the Head Start education program and a ban on armor-piercing bullets gave other Republicans pause.</p>
        <p>''There are a number of votes that seem strange,'' said Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, one of Miami's two Cuban-American House members, ''but I try to put them in perspective with the times and the circumstances.''</p>
        <p>But many Bush advisers played down the issue. Tom Rath, a Republican national committeeman from New Hampshire who still advises the campaign, said: ''The Democrats' attempts to make Cheney a scary figure are not going to work, because he's not a scary figure. The base is very content with him, and if the base is content, then you can work on the middle.''</p>
        <p>And it is some of those centrists who have advice on softening Mr. Cheney's public image.</p>
        <p>''Bush has the warmth, and Cheney has the competence and integrity,'' said Jean Preston, a North Carolina delegate and a state assemblywoman. ''But we've got to make sure Cheney appeals to women and minorities, showing his interest and listening to their needs.''</p>
        <p>Bridging Mr. Cheney's world in the executive branch and executive boardroom to Mr. Bush's realm of ''compassionate conservatism'' will help define the campaign's success, Republican consultants say.</p>
        <p>''Cheney grew up in an environment that has not put him in contact with tens of millions of people who live in big cities, who suffer from poverty,'' said John D. Deardourff, a Republican strategist and long-time Cheney admirer. ''He doesn't have any first-hand awareness of that.  That's not a part of Dick's world.''</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Cheney has kept a low profile since arriving here on Sunday and has seemed a little uneasy with the adulation. Before attending tonight's convention events, Mr. Cheney paid a private visit to former President Gerald R. Ford, who took him to the White House. He later attended a lunch honoring Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, where he told the 1,000 attendees that running for vice president ''was not an assignment I volunteered for'' but one that he accepted because ''it was an important thing to do for the country.''</p>
        <p>Getting out what little message Mr. Cheney has had has been difficult. His press operation has been chaotic, and he has barely spoken to reporters here. Last Thursday, he hired Dirk Vande Beek, his spokesman when he was chief executive at the Halliburton Company, the big oil services company, to fill that job for his campaign.</p>
        <p>And today, Mr. Vande Beek said that Mr. Cheney was close to naming a chief of staff. Bush campaign aides have stepped in to keep reporters posted on Mr. Cheney's schedule, assemble a media contact list and organize a press pool.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney told lunch guests today that he and Mr. Bush would head out by train and barnstorm through Ohio, Michigan and Illinois for several days after the convention ''to take the battle straight to the heart of Democratic territory.''</p>
