        <p>The hearing room in Lower Manhattan was crowded and more than a little stuffy. Lawyers holding folders fat with documents waited to do battle in behalf of their clients, the city's politicians and their would-be challengers. The prize they were fighting for in an exhaustive three-day sprint was a place on the primary ballot in September.</p>
        <p>It is doubtful that this is how the Founding Fathers envisioned elections at the local level, and Hollywood certainly never tells the story this way. But then, Mr. Smith and the Farmer's Daughter were not running for office in New York City.</p>
        <p>In the city's political culture, anyone can decide to run for office, but getting on the ballot can be a real hurdle. Candidates and political parties routinely challenge the paperwork of their opponents to try and keep them off the ballot. And it is in three days of hearings at the New York City Board of Elections that the candidates make their cases, and that their fate is decided by the 10 board commissioners.</p>
        <p>''The hearings represent a way that candidates fight political battles without involving the voters,'' said Jerry H. Goldfeder, an election lawyer who represents six candidates and who spent much of the last two days at the hearings.</p>
        <p>Cynthia Jenkins, a former assemblywoman from Queens who has run for several offices since she was defeated by a challenger in the Democratic primary in 1994, found herself on the defensive at the hearings. This year, Mrs. Jenkins, long a political maverick at odds with the Democratic establishment, filed to run for a State Senate seat and also for the position of Democratic district leader. Lawyers representing the Democratic Party in Queens challenged her petitions for both jobs.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Jenkins had filed 1,500 signatures, although only 1,000 were required for candidates for the State Senate. Lawyers for the party contended that many of the signatures were invalid because the people who signed the forms were not registered with the Democratic Party, lived outside the district or had committed some other error.</p>
        <p>''They always try to get me knocked off the ballot,'' Mrs. Jenkins said. ''They don't want me on the ballot because they know I will win.''</p>
        <p>In the week before the hearing, Mrs. Jenkins spent several days in the board's offices reconciling the names on her petitions with the board's voter registration information. She presented her case using  the board's own figures and survived the challenge to her Senate petitions,  but was removed from the ballot for the district leader position.</p>
        <p>Although some of the cases before the board are routine, others provide for a bit more theater.</p>
        <p>At Monday's hearing, the commissioners considered an attempt by United States Representative Major R. Owens to have Una S. T. Clarke, his rival in the Democratic primary, removed from the ballot. The two were close friends until Ms. Clarke decided to challenge Mr. Owens for his Congressional seat. Lawyers for Mr. Owens, a Democrat from Brooklyn, argued that the Jamaican-born Ms. Clarke could not legally run for office because she had voted here before she became an American citizen.</p>
        <p>At the hearing, however, her lawyer produced a naturalization certificate that showed she had become a citizen before she voted here. The lawyer had a copy of the certificate enlarged to poster size for dramatic effect. The board ruled in her favor.</p>
        <p>In another unusual case, the board heard from Joey Jackson, a lawyer who was seeking to run in the Democratic primary for an Assembly seat in the Bronx but who said he changed his mind after receiving threats against his family. Mr. Jackson had filed a form with the board, stating that he would not be a candidate. But within a few hours, he changed his mind and tried to revoke his earlier filing, saying that he wished to be a candidate after all.</p>
        <p>After impassioned arguments by lawyers on each side, the board announced its decision. Once a candidate files a form declining to be a candidate, the board reasoned, he is bound by that decision. After considering his options, Mr. Jackson decided to let the board's decision stand. ''A divisive court battle with the Democratic organization would not be in anyone's best interest, particularly not myself and my family,'' Mr. Jackson said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The hearings look much like a tribunal. The commissioners sit behind an elevated desk and listen to the arguments of both sides. The party filing the complaint -- usually for an incumbent -- stands at one microphone in front of the desk, and the party defending the petitions -- usually for an insurgent -- stands before the other.</p>
        <p>In this week's round of hearings,  objections were lodged against the petitions of 335 candidates running for office. Although many of those candidates chose not to fight the challenge, the board had 161 cases to hear. An official tabulation of how many survived will not be available until tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, the defense being offered seems doomed to fail. Josephine Jones, 68, a retired librarian making her first attempt at elective office, found her petitions challenged. Ms. Jones, who filed forms to run for a State Senate seat in Queens, was challenged by the Democratic Party, which said that she had failed to get the 1,000 signatures required under the state's election law.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jones knew that she had collected no more than 700 signatures, but she wanted to explain her case to the commissioners and ask for more time.</p>
        <p>''I just thought if I could get a little more time, I could get the rest,'' Ms. Jones said, appearing a little worn from the hours of sitting in the hearing room. ''I just wanted them to give me a little consideration.''</p>
        <p>What she got instead was a sympathetic, though firm response from Weyman A. Carey, the commissioner who is the president of the board. ''I'm sorry,'' he said, before delivering the bad news.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Ms. Jones said she was disheartened by being thrown off the Democratic Party line but pleased that she would remain on the ballot in November, on the Green Party line, which was not being challenged.</p>
        <p>''Going through this is a difficult thing,'' she said. ''What we really need is for the board to have an education program for people to learn how to get on the ballot.'' Pausing, she added, ''Or maybe we need another system of getting on the ballot.''</p>
