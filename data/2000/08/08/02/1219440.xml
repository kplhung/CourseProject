        <p>Since he became the Republican vice presidential nominee, Dick Cheney has been depicted as some kind of right-wing kook. His detractors have scoured his record in Congress and plucked out a few votes with no reference to their context. They toss out conclusions about him that have no relation to his splendid reputation among his former colleagues, Republican and Democrat alike. But if his detractors continue to focus on only a few of his thousands of votes, let's at least be upfront with the facts.</p>
        <p>South Africa sanctions. Dick Cheney opposed sanctions against South Africa under apartheid and voted against a resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela. But the issues then were not so simple.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, there was a consensus to end apartheid. The debate was whether sanctions should be imposed or whether we should follow President Ronald Reagan's policy of free trade and open dialogue. Mr. Reagan believed the American companies could best help black South Africans by giving them jobs. Sanctions, the thinking went, would only hurt black South Africans, because these companies would have to pull out.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the resolution to free Mr. Mandela contained language requiring official recognition of the African National Congress as the legitimate representative of the black majority. But the South African government was then our ally in stemming communism in Africa, particularly in Angola, and the leaders of the A.N.C. included admitted communists.</p>
        <p>When Dick Cheney cast his votes, neither he nor anyone else knew when the cold war would end. Nor could we know that sanctions would ultimately help create a free South Africa. Members of the House are issued voting cards, not crystal balls.</p>
        <p>Equal rights amendment. It is not easy being a minority member of the House. The majority party can use procedures that deprive the minority of offering amendments. That's what happened when Democrats brought the equal rights amendment to the House for consideration under ''Suspension of the Rules,'' which doesn't allow debate or amendments -- even though this legislation would have amended the Constitution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney has always supported the equal rights amendment. He voted no because he believed that a proposed amendment to the Constitution should be subject to full debate. But this vote was not about equal rights for women. This was about the Democrats' hardball efforts to create an issue during a campaign year.</p>
        <p>Head Start. If Dick Cheney were voting today on whether to expand this program, or any other social program, he would first ask whether it was worthwhile. If the answer was yes, the next question would be, ''Can we afford it?'' The answer today, with the surpluses piling up, is likely yes. But Mr. Cheney served in Congress during the days of huge deficits. It's never easy for politicians to say no to worthwhile programs, but if we hadn't had members of Congress like him to cast these tough votes, we might not have the luxury of surpluses we wallow in today.</p>
        <p>Gun control. In Wyoming, gun control means holding your rifle steady. We have a different lifestyle; we learn to use firearms for hunting or target practice responsibly at an early age. The way for a guy to be ''outside the mainstream'' -- or out of office -- is to vote for gun control. The last time I checked, members of Congress are encouraged to represent their constituency. But things change, and the Columbine shootings and other tragedies have haunted us all. I personally know that Dick Cheney would almost surely  support tough laws to keep guns out of the hands of juveniles and criminals. He would also support child safety locks and raising the age of handgun possession to 21.</p>
        <p>The environment. Mr. Cheney is an avid outdoorsman, committed to conservation and a clean environment. I remember his steady efforts on behalf of an act that set aside thousands of acres of Wyoming for special protection. No one fought harder for it than he did, despite the powerful economic interests and many Republicans fighting against the designation.</p>
        <p>To evaluate his record fairly, one must look at the 1980's, with its deficits and cold war antagonisms. And one must remember that he represented a very conservative state, and ask whether these votes are relevant to judging his qualifications. As vice president, he would take a broader view than his role of congressman from Wyoming required. After all, we know that as defense secretary during the gulf war, Mr. Cheney was calm and cool under pressure -- thoughtful, competent and trustworthy. What he is not is an extremist. Those who know him will tell you this, including honest Democrats.</p>
