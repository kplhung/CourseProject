        <p>The Chilean Supreme Court voted in secret today to strip Gen. Augusto Pinochet of his senatorial immunity, according to local radio and web site accounts. The decision would remove the last legal obstacle to a full-scale criminal investigation of the former dictator and would permit his trial on charges of kidnapping, murder and torture.</p>
        <p>The president of the court, Hernan Alvarez, said the justices would release their opinion formally sometime next week. ''We are not going to make any statements,'' said Mr. Alvarez, after the 20 justices consulted for four hours today. ''The Supreme Court has instructed me merely to say an agreement was reached.''</p>
        <p>But neither he nor any other court or government official disputed the reports, all attributed to anonymous sources close to the Supreme Court and the presidential palace, and all widely disseminated among Chileans.</p>
        <p>The vote, reported as 11 to 9, had been expected after the court's 11-to-9 rejection last week of a defense motion to proceed with medical tests of the former dictator before ruling on his immunity.</p>
        <p>''I am very content,'' said Juan Bustos, a lawyer for human rights victims involved in the case against General Pinochet. ''The report surging through the courthouse is that we have won and General Pinochet no longer has immunity from prosecution.'' There were no public reactions from General Pinochet's lawyers or family.</p>
        <p>With the decision, the Supreme Court has apparently upheld a ruling made in May by the Chilean Court of Appeals, which was also disclosed to many of the same news organizations more than a week before it became official. Observers have theorized that the courts and government are using the technique to try to soften reactions and control the size of demonstrations supporting and opposing General Pinochet.</p>
        <p>Lawyers arguing the case against General Pinochet maintained that there was enough evidence linking him to disappearances and other crimes that he should be stripped of his senatorial immunity. Never elected to the Senate, General Pinochet took his life-time seat in 1998 under a constitutional provision written during his 17-year dictatorship.</p>
        <p>The case against General Pinochet gathered momentum here after he was arrested in London in 1998 on a Spanish warrant for many serious rights violations. He was freed for health reasons four months ago and allowed to return to Chile, but his standing in society and even among the military leaders and right-wing parties has suffered.</p>
        <p>During the proceedings, no evidence ever linked the general definitively to any single crime. But prosecutors are hoping that his deteriorating legal status will encourage several retired officers who are already imprisoned to testify that the former dictator was aware of their crimes or helped cover them up.</p>
        <p>''This is just the beginning of the legal process and there will need to be a long investigation to gather proof,'' said Ricardo Israel, a political scientist at the University of Chile. ''For a conviction, some eyewitness or document has to come forward, otherwise the evidence is all circumstantial.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Israel and many other experts say General Pinochet, who is 84 and suffers a variety of health problems, will probably die before he can be convicted. But for many critics of his government, the fact that he could face justice in Chilean courts at all is a giant step toward a full civilian-based democracy.</p>
        <p>Sebastian Brett, the Human Rights Watch representative in Chile, said the court's stripping of General Pinochet's immunity would signify ''the most important decision in Chilean judicial history.'' He added, ''It would show that dictators are not above the law in their country.''</p>
        <p>Judge Juan Guzman, who is prosecuting the Pinochet case, is now expected to force the general to answer a long series of questions meant to link him to a case involving 19 people who disappeared soon after the 1973 coup that brought him to power. The 19 are believed to have been executed on the orders of top Pinochet aides.</p>
        <p>The general's lawyers say he is not guilty in the executions and disappearances of more than 3,000 people. But during the Supreme Court hearings last month they argued that he was not healthy enough to stand trial because he was unable to direct his lawyers adequately.</p>
        <p>However, they said any tests of the former ruler for mental illness would be unacceptable. That claim will probably set up the next legal test, since under Chilean law all criminal defendants over 70 must receive a medical examination before trial, and mental illness may prevent legal proceedings to go forward.</p>
        <p>General Pinochet's legal maneuverings appear intended to broaden defendants' due-process protections  to include physical illnesses as well as mental health problems.</p>
