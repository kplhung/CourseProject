        <p>PERHAPS no drink is as rich in myth and ritual as tequila.</p>
        <p>No, tequila is not made from cactus juice. It is made from the blue agave plant and is produced only in five designated areas in Mexico.</p>
        <p>And no, tequila does not contain worms. Those bottles with a showpiece worm at the bottom are mezcal, which is also produced from agave plants.</p>

        <p>PERHAPS no drink is as rich in myth and ritual as tequila.</p>
        <p>No, tequila is not made from cactus juice. It is made from the blue agave plant and is produced only in five designated areas in Mexico.</p>
        <p>And no, tequila does not contain worms. Those bottles with a showpiece worm at the bottom are mezcal, which is also produced from agave plants.</p>
        <p>And the ritual of sandwiching shots of tequila between salt licking and lime sucking is not followed in Mexico, except by American college students visiting on spring break.</p>
        <p>Aside from mass-produced tequilas, the foundation of slushy frozen drinks and serviceable margaritas, another tier of tequilas is made by artisans and intended for savoring. Unlike the mass-produced tequilas, which by law must contain at least 51 percent blue agave, the artisanal tequilas are 100 percent blue agave and say so on the label.</p>
        <p>For years, only one 100 percent agave tequila, Herradura, was available in the United States, thanks to Bing Crosby and Phil Harris, who discovered it on a trip to Mexico in the 1940's and arranged for its distribution in this country. In the last decade, though, sales of 100 percent agave tequila have taken off.</p>
        <p>A shortage of blue agave in Mexico in the last year has resulted in rising prices and shortages in the United States, primarily of mixed tequilas. Premium producers, more likely to own their own agave fields, have not been hit so hard.</p>
        <p>All tequilas are classified by how long they are aged. Blanco or silver tequilas are bottled almost immediately after being distilled. Reposados are aged in wood for at least two months, and anejos are aged in wood for at least a year. As they age, tequilas become more mellow and take on character from the wood. The anejos, in particular, are intended for sipping, rather than blending into cocktails. Tequilas labeled ''gold'' are blancos with a coloring agent added.</p>
        <p>Many tequila lovers consider blancos the ultimate expression of the agave and therefore the truest tequila, largely unaffected by the flavors of wood. Blancos are versatile as well, fine for sipping and great for margaritas.</p>
        <p>CHINACO BLANCO: $35  Aromas of minerals, lemon peel and anise, outstanding smoothness.</p>
        <p>. . .  EL TESORO DE DON FELIPE, SILVER: $30  Bright and fresh with a pronounced flavor of minerals and salt.</p>
        <p>. . .  PATRON SILVER: $41  Aromas of salt, minerals and licorice, very smooth.</p>
        <p>. . .  HERRADURA SILVER: $27  Herbal aroma, with an unusual flavor almost like chili peppers.</p>
        <p>. . .  EL CONQUISTADOR: $33  Mineral aroma and a mouth-filling flavor, very smooth.</p>
        <p>. . .  TRES RIOS: $12 (375 milliters)  Herbaceous, salty and minerally aromas and flavors.</p>
        <p>Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in Manhattan wine shops.</p>
