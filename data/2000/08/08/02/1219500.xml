        <p>For all its focus on a nicer, blander image, there is one thing the Bush campaign wants to be negative about -- negative campaigning from the other side.</p>
        <p>Former President George Bush complained that attacks on the vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, were ''coming out of the bowels of the Democratic National Committee.''</p>
        <p>In Columbus, Ohio, the former president's son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, said ''Americans are ''sick and tired of the politics of tearing people down.'' In Charleston, W. Va., he said: ''This nation is looking for an administration that will appeal to our better angels, not our darker impulses. This nation does not want four more years of Clinton-Gore.''</p>
        <p>Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, told a youth group here, ''We're not trashing our opponents, we're not looking back.''</p>
        <p>And Monday night the prospective nominee's wife, Laura Bush, told the delegates that her husband ''sets a tone that's positive and constructive, a tone that is very different from the bitterness and division that too often characterizes Washington, D.C.''</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said this consistent message was not derived from polls or focus groups but from the candidate's ''heart.'' But a prominent Republican operative, Frank Luntz, said it matched the strategy his focus groups had dictated.</p>
        <p>''Voters don't like political attack dogs,'' Mr. Luntz said, ''and they have complained for two decades about the negativity of politics.'' Only now, he said, were they beginning to vote against sponsors of negative advertisements. So, he added, ''Once you destroy the messenger, you destroy his message.'' He acknowledged, however, that the first Democratic advertisement attacking Mr. Cheney's voting record in the House over Head Start, the school lunch program and the Clean Water Act seemed to work against Mr. Cheney among independents.</p>
        <p>But Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication here at the University of Pennsylvania, said, ''I think they misunderstand what the electorate believes to be appropriate campaigning.'' She added, ''If the public believes it's accurate, the likelihood is that because it's a low-key ad, the public is likely to accept it as legitimate campaigning.''</p>
        <p>And Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, said: ''It comes back to the charge. If you prove the charge is false, then negative campaign against negative campaign is fine. But if the charge is true and relevant, all the bellyaching and all the campaigning cannot hide one's voting record.'' In this case, he said, ''they are squealing extra loud on something they have no way of refuting.''</p>
        <p>But while his arguments matched the general line, there was an intensity to the former president's comments, made on NBC's ''Today.'' .</p>
        <p>He called the criticism of Mr. Cheney, his former secretary of defense,  ''crazy.''</p>
        <p>''What are you going to say when you get a great, outstanding choice like Cheney, who's widely respected?'' former President Bush continued. ''They've got a carping -- they've got a little minion sitting there with their dark glasses, you know, digging up dirt on someone.''</p>
        <p>''People don't want that anymore,'' the former president said. ''But let them try. Cheney's much bigger than all that, more proven than all that. And if something ever happened to George when they were elected, he'd make an outstanding president of the United States. So I don't worry about that opposition research crowd digging. 'Hey, look what I found,' some little nerd sitting there in the Democratic National Committee. It doesn't make any difference.''</p>
        <p>Mark Fabiani, a Gore spokesman, responded, ''it tells you a lot about George Junior that he has to send his father out to defend himself.'' He said: ''Someone's record is a legitimate issue. It's hardly improper to criticize someone's record.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Fabiani said that Gov. Bush was no innocent when it came to negative campaigning, noting that his first defense of Mr. Cheney was a hostile comparison to President Clinton. Gov. Bush said of Mr. Cheney, ''He's a man who understands what the definition of 'is' is.''</p>
        <p>That was a reference to Mr. Clinton's testimony in August 1999, when prosecutors asked him if he had lied in January of that year when he denied having had a sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.</p>
