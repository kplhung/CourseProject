        <p>The most logical man to become Israel's president was Shimon Peres. But Parliament isn't logical. And it will never be logical as long as state isn't separated from synagogue.</p>

        <p>Re ''Peres, Defeated for President, Seems Finished With Politics'' (front page, Aug. 1):</p>
        <p>The most logical man to become Israel's president was Shimon Peres. But Parliament isn't logical. And it will never be logical as long as state isn't separated from synagogue.</p>
        <p>To say Mr. Peres lost because he was a political loser is to say peace is a loser. Thus, a three-time prime minister, a visionary to whom peace for Israel was the only practical pursuit, who is a Nobel Prize laureate, was defeated by a fragmented legislature.</p>
