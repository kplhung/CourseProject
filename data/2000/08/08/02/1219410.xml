        <p>AT the moment, I have jet lag. I want to sleep when I should be awake; I'm wide awake when I should be asleep; and I crave breakfast at the most unreasonable hours. It is an unexpectedly familiar feeling -- not because I'm some international jet-setter, but because I suffer from a form of jet lag even when I haven't gone anywhere.</p>
        <p>We each have an internal body clock. Mine has long been out of sync with the clock that rules my life and my work.</p>
        <p>If my personal clock had its way, it would wake me at about 10 in the morning and we would amble into the office. We would start our day slowly -- opening the mail, answering phone calls -- and then we would have lunch. At 2 o'clock we would snap into efficient and energetic gear, writing furiously, barely looking up, until 7 o'clock or (much) later.</p>
        <p>I realized with delight and relief years ago that my natural rhythm perfectly matches the rhythm of a newsroom, which is one of the reasons I began to do what I do.</p>
        <p>Then, I had children. No more sleeping until 9 or 10. Next, I left the newsroom for a home office where I write books and magazine articles, neither of which requires daily sprints toward deadline. I still rev up mentally at 2 in the afternoon, anyway, but school lets out for my boys at 3. Early each day I vow to become a morning person. It hasn't happened.</p>
        <p>Added to this is my insomnia problem. Periodically I find myself bolt upright in bed at 2 a.m., wide awake in a way that makes it clear my sleep is over for the night. Before I knew better, I would try to drift off. Now I give in, get up and work until dawn. Though it wouldn't be my choice of a schedule, there is something cozy about sitting at the computer in the dark, sipping a cup of tea or a mug of hot chocolate. The most interesting part is that I'm not the only one awake. I have answered e-mails at the oddest hours, and, minutes after I hit SEND, I receive a reply.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thomas M. Kilkenny, director of the Sleep Center at the Staten Island University Hospital, says this is nothing so exotic as a rebellious body clock. It's called sleep maintenance insomnia, and it is always a symptom of something off-kilter in the (non) sleeper's life.</p>
        <p>Though the cause can be physical, he says, it is more commonly a result of what he describes as poor sleep hygiene, or not taking the time to wind down properly at the end of the day. ''A lot of go-getters are very busy until the moment they go to bed,'' he says. ''You can't go from fourth gear on the highway to a complete stop just like that.''</p>
        <p>Instead, he suggests that I shut off all ''brain stimuli'' (that includes the laptop and the television set) about an hour or more before bedtime. If that doesn't work, and I wake in the middle of the night anyway, he says I should relax in bed for no more than 20 minutes, and if sleep doesn't come I should leave the bedroom rather than toss and turn. After that he prescribes a softly lighted room, quiet music and a glass of milk. No computer, because that sends a wake-up signal to the brain. No caffeine (meaning no hot cocoa and no tea) because that wakes up the rest of me. I can be in control of this problem, he promises. It doesn't have to control me.</p>
        <p>But is it always bad for the body to be in control?</p>
        <p>Ben Mezerich, for one, has turned his backward biorhythms into a way of life. He realized back in college that he functioned poorly during the day. So, upon graduation seven years ago, he became a fiction writer ''because they can set their own hours.'' Under the pen name Holden Scott, he's had a good deal of success while working between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. every night. He's even turned down a few ''real jobs'' writing for a television series because he would have had to get up in the morning. ''I do my best work at night,'' he says. ''To change my schedule would mean I couldn't do my best work.''</p>
        <p>I'm far from ready to live on what Mr. Mezerich calls ''vampire time,'' but I can't help noticing that I get a lot of work done in those silent, sleepless hours. This column, by the way, was written mostly in the middle of the night. And Randall Enos, who drew that wonderful little sketch up above it, regularly works all night, sometimes because work deadlines require it but usually because that's when the creative energy starts to flow.</p>
        <p>The key, he says, is to be prepared to ''crash'' midway through the next afternoon. When that happens, he gives in and takes a nap. I'd happily do that, too, but that's just about the time my children are getting home.</p>
