        <p>Some faithful Republican homes here glow with the blue light of faithful Republican television-watching these convention nights. But no one could say that even the most stalwart of stalwarts are sitting on the edges of their leather couches. Perfect scripting, it seems, comes with a price: lukewarm attention, and minimal effect.</p>
        <p>Four couples on White Oak Circle, a sloping cul-de-sac in this gracious, Republican-leaning suburb of Pittsburgh, shared their reactions as the convention unfolded and largely concurred that for them, it held little excitement, less suspense and an infinitesimal chance of changing their minds about anything.</p>
        <p>Some viewers described a sense, rather, of watching as a precaution, on the off chance that something could bollix up George W. Bush's momentum. It would have been more riveting if the choice of running mate had remained unclear, they said, or differing opinions on platform issues were expressed. But no such luck; so somehow, even on the 48- and 50-inch TV sets that fill whole den walls here, the convention seemed a small event.</p>
        <p>Even Monday night's trickiest moment, when Colin L. Powell chided his fellow Republicans from the convention's rostrum for opposition to affirmative action, caused little stir on White Oak Circle. Tired and a bit distracted at that late hour, the viewers let it slip by, focusing instead on their continuing admiration for General Powell, whom several described as a great potential president, and their new affection for Laura Bush, who, they said, will make an appealing first lady if her husband makes it to the White House.</p>
        <p>''I'm watching to make sure he doesn't mess up,'' Dr. Dick Lewis, a surgeon, said of Mr. Bush. ''His single most outstanding characteristic is that he's got the ability to beat Gore. That's more important than this platform or anything else, as far as I'm concerned.''</p>
        <p>It is a bit, Dr. Lewis said, like a golf tournament that ends on Sunday: ''You can't win the tournament on Saturday, but you can lose it.''</p>
        <p>Down the street, Diane Goldschmidt, community service coordinator at Mount Lebanon's award-winning high school, said she had explained to her 18-year-old son that ''if some major trauma occurred, if Bush had a heart attack or we found out he's a spy, if something occurred that would prevent him being a candidate, this is when it would happen.''</p>
        <p>Short of that, she said, she has read enough about Mr. Bush in recent years that ''I know my opinion won't be altered.''</p>
        <p>Her husband, Jack, a financial consultant, noted that this time around, he had no real questions lingering about candidates or issues, which  was by no means the case when Mr. Bush's father ran against Ross Perot eight years ago.</p>
        <p>And in general, Mr. Goldschmidt said, the convention ''is like the State of the Union address: it's a feel-good thing.''</p>
        <p>''Could we do without it?'' he said. ''Sure we could. It's a chance to get together and toot your horn; it's a media show, and I don't think it's ever going to change.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the convention's limitations, they did not prevent the viewers from enjoying Monday night's top speeches and forming a few new impressions. For one thing, Mrs. Bush garnered high marks.</p>
        <p>''She's much better than I expected her to be; she's very natural,''  Jeff Lammert, vice president of a company that makes steel-cutting shears, said as she spoke.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lammert's wife, Teri, responded particularly when Mrs. Bush talked about returning respect to the presidency, a reference to the Clinton scandals. ''That's a powerful comment,'' Mrs. Lammert said. ''That brings up a lot of memories of what happened. I think we have to make the presidency respectable again, and I think he can do it and she can help.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lewis's wife, Charlene, a nurse and mother of three, said she felt as if she could relate to Mrs. Bush. ''She is foremost a mom before anything else,'' Mrs. Lewis said, ''and in the baby-boom generation I think that a lot of people can relate to her -- at least I can. She mentioned the empty-nest syndrome she's facing this fall, which is something we're facing. And she seemed so down to earth, I loved her.''</p>
        <p>General Powell's speech brought praise as well, although here the convention organizers' strategy of scheduling the highest-profile speeches for after 10 p.m., when there would be network air time, seemed to backfire a bit.</p>
        <p>At the Lammerts' house, some fatigued visiting friends listened to the beginning of the speech, then jumped off into a long, loud tangent about testing teachers for competency. At the Lewises', Charlene had to run out for car-pool duty. And Lea Smith, a lawyer who was watching at home with her husband, Temp, also a lawyer, dropped off to sleep about 10:30.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Smith had watched much of the evening, she said, and felt no shift in her opinions about the party, the issues or Mr. Bush. ''Every time they talked about streamlining federal government, reducing bureaucracy, I felt energized,'' she said. ''And then they talked about his education initiative and requiring reading literacy at third-grade level by third grade, and I thought, 'That's all well and good, but that seems like as much or more federal involvement.' ''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Smith was also struck, she said, by the way all the earlier speakers followed the same pattern: they would talk about what they had managed to achieve because America was a land of opportunity, ''then education, then what good Bush was going to do, and then God bless America.''</p>
        <p>''It was a little comical,'' she said. ''It made it seem less of a usual convention and more scripted, more planned and executed according to a common plan. But I guess when I look at the whole -- the running mate already named, the platform already being passed -- what else is there to do?''</p>
        <p>She and most of her neighbors said they would continue watching the convention in dribs and drabs, and certainly try to tune in when Mr. Bush speaks on Thursday night. But they have little expectation of bombshells. ''I can't imagine anything that George Bush would say that would make me vote for his opponent,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lewis said nostalgically that he missed ''the goofy bowler hats they used to wear'' at political conventions, ''and noisemaker horns.'' Somehow, he said, ''it doesn't seem like there's quite the party atmosphere you used to get.''</p>
