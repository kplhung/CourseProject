        <p>A lingering heat wave throughout the West drove demand for electric power in California to near-record levels today and brought the state close to a full-scale power emergency. Such an emergency would have prompted rolling blackouts, in order for power administrators to keep the state's giant, overburdened electricity grid from crashing completely.</p>
        <p>For the second straight day, the California Independent System Operator, which controls about 75 percent of the state's electric power grid on behalf of private utilities, declared a statewide Stage 2 emergency at midday. In a Stage 2 emergency, power is curtailed to commercial and industrial users that receive  power-rate discounts in exchange for agreeing to shut down when asked to do so in times of high demand.</p>

        <p>A lingering heat wave throughout the West drove demand for electric power in California to near-record levels today and brought the state close to a full-scale power emergency. Such an emergency would have prompted rolling blackouts, in order for power administrators to keep the state's giant, overburdened electricity grid from crashing completely.</p>
        <p>For the second straight day, the California Independent System Operator, which controls about 75 percent of the state's electric power grid on behalf of private utilities, declared a statewide Stage 2 emergency at midday. In a Stage 2 emergency, power is curtailed to commercial and industrial users that receive  power-rate discounts in exchange for agreeing to shut down when asked to do so in times of high demand.</p>
        <p>Officials warned that a Stage 3 emergency, which has never been declared, was possible because a stubborn high-pressure system stretching from Mexico to Canada had kept temperatures so high that air-conditioning systems were working harder and longer throughout the entire region. In a Stage 3 alert, ''rotating blackouts'' to small parts of communities are imposed to keep the larger system up and running.</p>
        <p>In California, which began deregulating the electric power industry four years ago, and around the nation, a decade of economic growth and under-investment in new power plants has left power reserves at the lowest levels in decades. And because the current heat wave is so widespread, California has been unable to import enough power from other states.</p>
        <p>This morning officials warned that overall demand in California today was expected to exceed 46,245 megawatts, breaking a record of 45,884 megawatts, set just last year.</p>
        <p>But at 3:30 p.m., the system, handling 43,400 megawatts, had already cut off about 1,800 megawatts to industrial users as a result of the Stage 2 alert. That left the system with  about 3 percent more power than the demands on it. A Stage 3 alert is automatically called if reserves fall below 1.5 percent.</p>
        <p>If a Stage 3 event worked as planned, ''we'd have to impose rotating outages to small portions of communities across all our service area,'' said Tom Boyd, a spokesman for Southern California Edison, which supplies power over 50,000 square miles in Central and Southern California, including much of suburban Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles itself, the city's municipal utility, the venerable Department of Water and Power, controls its own, independent electric power source and would not be expected to be affected by a Stage 3 alert.</p>
        <p>Doug Kline, spokesman for San Diego Gas and Electric, which serves 1.2 million homes and businesses in the San Diego area, a total of about three million people, said the utility would treat any blackout caused by shortages as it treats a natural disaster.</p>
        <p>For customers on life support who cannot have their power interrupted, ''we encourage them to have some backup generation in the case of something like this,'' Mr. Kline said.</p>
        <p>''But obviously they're in a different category of customers,'' Mr. Kline said, adding that ''we work with those customers when we know where they are.''</p>
