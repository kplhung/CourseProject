        <p>It hardly seems the stuff consumer thrills are made of: a weak, watery tea, brewed the old-fashioned way, with hardly any sugar and even less caffeine. Marketing? There is almost none. Edgy television ads and celebrity endorsements? Zero.</p>
        <p>Still, when Seth Goldman and Barry Nalebuff started Honest Tea two years ago, in part to fill what they saw as a neglected market niche and in part to make a point, they were well aware that they would be competing against mass-marketed sweetened iced teas made by the Coca-Colas, PepsiCos and Snapples of the world.</p>
        <p>Beverages mixed up to address a specific target market are nothing new; microbreweries making specialty beers ran long and hard with the concept. But the beverage industry is especially tough on new brands; even Coke and Pepsi have stumbled over the years while trying to induce consumers to try something new.</p>
        <p>''There are probably hundreds of beverages introduced around the country every year, and most do not succeed,'' said John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade newsletter. ''This is a huge market that requires a great tasting product, good marketing, lots of money and good distribution.''</p>
        <p>As luck, or insight, would have it, when Honest Tea started landing on store shelves, consumers were showing a distinct preference for bottled water and other beverages perceived to be more healthful. And for all it did not have, the founders saw their product as distinct enough from established brands to attract a different customer. ''If we were to compete against the big companies on their terms, unless we won the lottery, we would be finished,'' said Mr. Nalebuff, a professor of game theory at the Yale School of Management.</p>
        <p>Instead, he and Mr. Goldman, a former pupil of his and an alumnus of the Calvert Group, the largest sponsor of ''socially responsible'' mutual funds, decided to set their own terms. They would make an iced tea that promoted the tea flavor and would be naturally low in calories.</p>
        <p>''The funniest thing was, why hadn't anyone else done this?'' Mr. Nalebuff (pronounced NAIL-buff) said. ''It wasn't rocket science.''</p>
        <p>They steered clear of artificial sweeteners; and their philosophy on sugar was that less was more. Their tea leaves had to be of high quality, and therefore costly. They promoted the teas through trade shows and presentations to supermarket chains. They included a Web site, of course (www.honesttea.com), and printed a toll-free number, (800) 865-4736, on labels for consumer feedback.</p>
        <p>The two partners used their own money, as well as financing from friends and family, to amass the $507,000 needed to get the company going in early 1998; since the product went on the market that year, $2.7 million more in financing has been raised, mostly from passionate consumers. Distribution, always tricky in the beverage business, has been a patchwork arrangement, encompassing everything from driving their own U-Hauls to piggybacking the product onto delivery trucks belonging to a corned beef company with lots of deli connections. Offering samples has been a cornerstone of the marketing strategy, as it is with many small companies. With sales expected to reach $3.5 million this year, the company anticipates its first brush with profitability.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Nalebuff, 41, the development of Honest Tea has been an eye-opening foray into the real world of supply and demand, a world that few academics experience day in and day out. For Mr. Goldman, 34, whose role in the company may have been presaged in childhood (his parents are scholars of Russia and China, two cultures that appreciate a properly made cup of tea), it has been an opportunity to apply what he learned in graduate school. It has also been a chance to see his former teacher in a new light.</p>
        <p>''Barry's reputation at Yale was as a very hard-nosed, cold-calling professor,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''You'd walk into the room, there would be a case study, and someone would be called on and put in the hot seat for most of the class.''</p>
        <p>He now sees Mr. Nalebuff as a supportive colleague. ''A lot of students, when they heard that I was going to partner with Barry, said, 'What is it like to have to go through that every day?' For me, he has been only affirming and encouraging.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''A lot of professors are getting involved in start-up companies. But how many of them really put money into them? And when Barry goes to bed at night and when he wakes up in the morning, he's thinking Honest Tea.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nalebuff said he had been surprised to learn how hard it was to put some of his own theories to work. ''I've written a book on cooperating with the people you compete with, and it's easy to say that,'' he said. ''But in practice it's much more difficult.''</p>
        <p>Recently, a competing brand wanted to make tea at the same bottling plant Honest Tea uses, and even wanted to try the same technology, the brainchild of Mr. Nalebuff and Mr. Goldman. ''We decided that eventually they would figure out how to do this on their own, and we would be willing to help speed up the process for the right amount of money,'' Mr. Nalebuff said. (They made a deal.)</p>
        <p>Honest Tea is expensive -- $2.50 for 16 fluid ounces in one Manhattan deli, compared with $1.50 for the same size Snapple iced tea -- but the founders' efforts to sell it through health food stores, gourmet food shops and restaurants seem to be catching on. Large supermarket chains like Shaw's, Wegmans and Grand Union also now carry Honest Tea.</p>
        <p>The expense provokes another puzzle for the professor. ''Many stores use rules like, we have to have 100 percent markup on everything we sell,'' Mr. Nalebuff noted. ''And that rule doesn't take into account the cost of making the product. If our drink costs 75 cents to make and someone else's costs 50 cents, they will sell ours for $1.50 and theirs for $1. Interestingly, the store makes 50 percent more on our product than on the other, but they don't always see the advantage of selling our product.''</p>
        <p>Honest Tea had its origins in a question Mr. Nalebuff posed to a class one day in 1995, when Mr. Goldman was among the students sitting in the lecture hall. ''I asked, 'Why isn't there a normal product for the rest of us?' '' recalled Mr. Nalebuff, a longtime drinker of iced tea. ''You can have 200 calories, or you can have zero calories with NutraSweet. But if you believe in declining margin utility, why isn't there a product out there with 10 to 20 calories? Anyone can handle that. It's fewer calories than a carrot.'' A teaspoon of sugar enhances the flavor of tea, he believes, ''but by the time you put 16 spoonfuls of sugar in, it's worthless.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Goldman, the point reverberated one afternoon about two years later, after a hot, sweaty run in Central Park. ''I went into one of these cafes, and there was nothing to drink that quenched my thirst,'' he said. ''I sort of banged on the table and said: 'That's it. We have to do something about this.' ''</p>
        <p>That afternoon, he sent Mr. Nalebuff an e-mail message asking if he was still interested in that soft drink idea he had mentioned in class. Coincidentally, Mr. Nalebuff had just returned from India, where he had tried unsuccessfully to sell the owners of Tata Tea Ltd. on the idea of starting a line called Honest Tea. It was not Mr. Nalebuff's first global business concept that failed to catch on. Earlier, he had wanted to sell fortune cookies to the Chinese, with each cookie containing an English lesson.</p>
        <p>What flopped in India, however, received the red carpet treatment back in the United States. ''When he told me the name Honest Tea, I felt like that was it, the angels singing,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''It was a product I wanted to create.''</p>
        <p>The idea, of course, was the easy part. The partners -- Mr. Nalebuff is chairman of the company, Mr. Goldman the chief executive, although Mr. Nalebuff insists on referring to him as the ''T.E.O.'' -- struggled to find a plant that would produce their product their way. They eventually set up their headquarters in Bethesda, Md., where Mr. Goldman is a daily presence and Mr. Nalebuff is on call from New Haven.</p>
        <p>They tried making tea in a giant tea bag, which was actually a laundry bag converted for the purpose. In one of the early rounds, the bag burst and spattered wet tea leaves all over the factory. Eventually they settled on a custom-made tea ball, an industrial-strength sphere of stainless steel that allows the tea to be steeped as long as necessary, to get the desired flavor.</p>
        <p>They developed partnerships with suppliers like the Crow Nation, which provides the Montana-grown peppermint leaves that are used in one flavor. They flirted with using other names for the company -- Perspicaci-Tea and Golf Tea were among the possibilities -- and at one point got a mildly threatening letter from lawyers for Nestle, which owns the Nestea brand and thought that Honest Tea might be misread as ''Ho Nestea.'' (Making the product's name into one word for trademark purposes, although it appears as two words in the marketplace, seems to have eliminated the problem.)</p>
        <p>Some industry experts have speculated that Honest Tea will have a hard time building the kind of market share that will keep it viable for the long run. ''They are going to have to convince distributors who already have trucks filled with strong products to make room for another product, and that's not easy,'' Mr. Sicher said. Still, he noted, some small companies do figure out a way to survive.</p>
        <p>The Honest Tea founders are optimistic, pointing to anecdotal evidence that their product has appeal beyond the obvious health food store and gourmet-deli circuit.</p>
        <p>''My name is Kurtis and I am a truck driver,'' read an e-mail Mr. Goldman recently received from a man who called himself ''a completely addicted iced tea junkie.'' The message continued: ''I stopped at the T/A truck stop at Antioch, Ill., and found your tea in the cooler. The info on the label caused me to buy three different bottles. It was mind blowing different.'' He closed by informing the company that its products could not be found in central Illinois, and begged to have his hometown become a test market.</p>
        <p>Speaking of tests, the Honest Tea partners leaped at the chance to grade each other's performance in the real world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nalebuff, the professor, said he would give Mr. Goldman an A+ for his work on the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldman, describing Mr. Nalebuff's role as ''more analytical on a day-to-day basis,'' awarded him an A. ''The ideas are always creative,'' the former pupil said. ''Barry is an out-of-the-box thinker. Of course, some ideas are in the box for a reason.''</p>
