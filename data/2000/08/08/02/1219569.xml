        <p>Charlie Ward and Allan Houston were at the NBA Store on Fifth Avenue yesterday to promote Jammin' Against the Darkness, a community outreach program that features Christian music and N.B.A. players speaking about their professional, personal and spiritual lives to people of all ages.</p>
        <p>Founded 10 years ago by the former San Antonio Spur David Wood and the evangelist Steve Jamison, this year's program will be held Aug. 19 at Madison Square Garden. The evening event will include performances by Hezekiah Walker, the Grammy Award-winning artist, and the Newsboys. Ward and Houston are scheduled to participate in a three-on-three tournament earlier in the day.</p>
