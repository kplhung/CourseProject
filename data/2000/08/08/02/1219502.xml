        <p>Senator Robert G. Torricelli's move to seize the Democratic nomination for New Jersey governor began with a swaggering boast: He declared that he alone had the stature to force bickering Democratic factions to unify and prepare to retake control of the State House. And he said he could do it all in a matter of weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli did manage to unite many party officials. But when they banded together, they lined up against him.</p>
        <p>After three weeks of hurried deal making, Mr. Torricelli was forced to quit the governor's race on Monday because he had lost a struggle for endorsements that looked less like backroom horse-trading than an all-out street brawl.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli had made a critical mistake, it turned out, by underestimating the strength of his opponent, Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge, who had spent much of the last six years ingratiating himself with Mayor Sharpe James of Newark and other local leaders.</p>
        <p>There was payback at work, too: Powerful Democrats like Senator Frank R. Lautenberg and Representative Robert Menendez had felt slighted by Mr. Torricelli during his rise to power and were eager to get back at him by helping Mr. McGreevey.</p>
        <p>What has emerged from the seismic political upheaval is a new balance of power within New Jersey's Democratic establishment, with Mr. Torricelli, one of Congress's most powerful Democrats, clearly diminished, and Mr. Menendez ascendant.</p>
        <p>''We were speculating about a graceful way for Torricelli to get out,'' said Raymond J. Lesniak, a state senator who is one of Mr. McGreevey's closest supporters. ''He could say, 'I got in this race to unify the Democratic Party, and I did.' ''</p>
        <p>While some of Mr. McGreevey's supporters gloated at Mr. Torricelli's swift and humbling failure, even the senator's detractors predicted that his political skill and ambition would enable him to rebound.</p>
        <p>But the episode stands as a lesson that in New Jersey politics -- the ultimate insider's game -- even the most high-flying figures can be brought to heel by a system that vests enormous king-making powers in a handful of county political chairmen. Mr. Torricelli's name recognition and Washington credentials were simply no match for Mr. McGreevey's alliances with Democratic operatives who could deliver the preferential ballot position that is crucial in primary elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli's interest in running for governor someday was widely known, but his decision last month to pursue the Democratic nomination blindsided Mr. Lesniak and other party leaders in northern and central New Jersey. They, like Mr. Torricelli, had long supported Mr. McGreevey, the near-winner in the 1997 governor's race and presumptive front-runner in 2001.</p>
        <p>Together, they had just helped Jon S. Corzine win a bitter Senate primary battle against Jim Florio, the candidate of a rebellious faction from South Jersey. Yet when Mr. Torricelli first surfaced as a potential candidate, the most outspoken proponents of a draft-Torricelli movement were those same South Jersey Democrats, led by George E. Norcross III, Camden County's de facto boss.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli himself made his intentions public two weeks ago, boldly outlining a strategy to steamroll across New Jersey, isolating Mr. McGreevey's support in his base counties: Union and Middlesex. Mr. Norcross would deliver a solid bloc of support in the seven South Jersey counties. Other allies would deliver the party lines in Monmouth, Morris and Passaic.</p>
        <p>The goal was breathtaking: Mr. Torricelli aimed to win the backing of roughly 70 percent of the state's Democratic county organizations before the national party convention in mid-August. The linchpins of his strategy were the endorsements of leaders in Hudson and Essex Counties. And for a few days, it seemed that Mr. Torricelli was well on his way: the Hudson County executive, Robert C. Janiszewski, was one of the first McGreevey supporters to switch sides.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McGreevey, who understood that Mr. Torricelli's Washington commitments would prevent him from fighting a protracted battle, dug in. Calling in political chits he had accumulated during nearly six years of statewide campaigning, he persuaded dozens of leaders in four South Jersey counties to stand by him publicly. And he received loud affirmations of support from such core constituencies as organized labor and black and Latino leaders.</p>
        <p>So when Mr. Torricelli and Mr. Norcross asserted that they were uniting the party, Mr. McGreevey could argue persuasively that they were only creating further divisions.</p>
        <p>Still, by late last week, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Norcross and their allies believed that victory was imminent. And with good reason: according to several officials, Joseph Doria -- the mayor of Bayonne, in Hudson County, and the minority leader in the state Assembly -- reached a stunning accord to endorse Mr. Torricelli, in talks with Mr. Norcross, who a year ago had tried to strip Mr. Doria of his leadership title.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doria, Mr. Janiszewski and other Hudson County officials were ready to endorse Mr. Torricelli last Thursday, several officials said, until Representative Menendez asked them to wait until after the weekend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Menendez had been lying in wait for Mr. Torricelli for more than a year. His complaint: that Mr. Torricelli had promised to support him for the Senate, but broke his word to lure Mr. Corzine into the race for Mr. Lautenberg's seat.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Menendez had a chance for retribution. By getting Mr. Torricelli's supporters in Hudson County to postpone their endorsement of the senator until Tuesday, Mr. Menendez bought valuable time for Mr. McGreevey.</p>
        <p>On Friday night, Mr. McGreevey, Mr. Lesniak and other officials visited Mayor James at his son's Newark night spot, the Millennium Club. Over the course of the evening, according to people present, Mr. McGreevey told Mr. James that if he came out publicly for Mr. McGreevey, he would not be alone.</p>
        <p>In Essex County, the mayors of East Orange, Orange, South Orange and Irvington would be with him, Mr. McGreevey said. More important, he told Mr. James, Hudson County was divided, with Mr. Menendez on Mr. McGreevey's side.</p>
        <p>''Nobody likes to be alone out there,'' one of Mr. McGreevey's top backers said. ''Not even Sharpe James.''</p>
        <p>Other Democratic officials, meanwhile, were beginning to question Mr. Torricelli's claim that he would be a far stronger candidate than Mr. McGreevey.</p>
        <p>The state Democratic chairman, Thomas Giblin, commissioned a poll over the weekend and found surprisingly deep support for Mr. McGreevey. In a head-to-head race, Mr. McGreevey led Mr. Torricelli among likely Democratic voters by 35 to 31 percent. When reminded that Mr. McGreevey nearly defeated Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in 1997, more than 70 percent of Democrats said he deserved a second chance.</p>
        <p>The poll also found that Mr. Torricelli's voter approval had been harmed by negative publicity about his investment in private stock issues and a federal investigation into the financing of his 1996 campaign. More than 20 percent of Democrats said those controversies made them less likely to support Mr. Torricelli.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli's impressive status in Washington, too, proved a liability with some New Jersey Democrats. On Saturday, the senator sought to rally support among black leaders and Essex County officials by attending East Orange Mayor Robert Bowser's annual picnic. But after 12 years as a congressman and four years mingling in Washington's high-powered fund-raising circles, Mr. Torricelli was not warmly received by party regulars, Mr. Bowser said.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Torricelli showed up and nobody knew him,'' Mr. Bowser said. ''Compared with when Mr. McGreevey showed up in the afternoon, and everybody said, 'McGreevey -- he's been here.' In the African-American community, people want to feel, touch and see their candidate.''</p>
        <p>As Democrats now turn to this fall's presidential and Senate contests, it is clear that the party's bruising infighting has dramatically altered the political landscape.</p>
        <p>Having won a standoff with New Jersey's most powerful Democrat, Mr. McGreevey is now far more formidable, and is unlikely to face a serious primary threat next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. James, if he has not already cut a deal, now holds the biggest i.o.u. in New Jersey politics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Menendez may well have supplanted Mr. Torricelli as the most influential member of the state's Congressional delegation. And for the first time, he finds himself unchallenged in his Hudson County base and with a seat at the table alongside Mr. Lesniak, Mr. McGreevey, Mr. Giblin and other top party leaders.</p>
        <p>Among Mr. Torricelli's supporters, Mr. Janiszewski is likely to pay a steep political price for breaking his promise to endorse Mr. McGreevey, and Mr. Doria could face a challenge as Assembly minority leader. Mr. Norcross must devise a new strategy for engineering a wider role within the party for his followers in South Jersey.</p>
        <p>But it is Mr. Torricelli who is the target of most of the criticism. Some of his supporters are furious, for example, that he pressured them into making politically costly endorsements, then ended his campaign at the first sign of adversity.</p>
        <p>''It was a game of chicken,'' said one of Mr. Torricelli's South Jersey backers. ''And Torricelli blinked.''</p>
        <p>Despite the outcome, Mr. Torricelli said he did not view the result as a personal rejection. Instead, he portrays the entire episode as a failed, but noble, attempt to strengthen a party that is still hobbled from within.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli said that whether or not the Democrats regained control of the United States Senate this fall, he planned to remain in Washington and run for re-election in 2002.</p>
        <p>''Everything in life isn't successful, but that doesn't mean it wasn't worth attempting,'' he said. ''Now it's up to someone else to attempt it.''</p>
