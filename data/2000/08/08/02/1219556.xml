        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani acknowledged for the first time tonight that he has been undergoing hormone treatments for his prostate cancer for two and a half months. He seemed to indicate that the hormones were a preliminary therapy and added that he would make a final decision about his treatment within a few weeks.</p>
        <p>''Which could either be radiation or surgery,'' he said. ''But luckily the hormones are working.'' He said the treatments had reduced the levels of prostate-specific antigens in his blood to ''minuscule'' amounts. ''I have no problems right now,'' he said, ''except every once in a while it leaves you a little fatigued.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani made his comments at the Republican National Convention here during a live, nationally televised interview on MSNBC with Tom Brokaw, who immediately asked the mayor about his health. Mr. Giuliani was relaxed and jovial in his response, in striking contrast to the verbal lashings he has given to City Hall reporters in New York who asked the same question in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>Last month, after The New York Daily News quoted unnamed sources who said that the mayor was being treated with the hormone Lupon, he angrily reprimanded reporters for trying to confirm the story during a news conference at City Hall Park. He neither confirmed nor denied the report.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani told Mr. Brokaw that he expected his treatments to take seven or eight months and that he was ''very optimistic.''</p>
        <p>The mayor made similar remarks in another live television interview tonight with Judy Woodruff and Bernard Shaw of CNN, although he did not say specifically that he was receiving hormones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani announced on April 27 that he had prostate cancer in an early, treatable form. On May 19, citing his cancer, he withdrew from his Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
