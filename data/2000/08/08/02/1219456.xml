        <p>Brent Staples Editorial Observer column says blacks and Hispanics are being paraded at Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, creating illusion of inclusion; says Republican Party remains as white as it has ever been and has written off black voters for election, directing entreaties to white, moderate suburbanites who abandoned it in 1992 to vote for Bill Clinton (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The African-Americans and Latinos being paraded across the stage at the Republican Convention are intended to give a hip, multicultural feel -- and dispel the pervasive notion that the G.O.P. is largely a party of, by and for white Americans. But subtract the minority props -- the break dancers and the gospel choir and the beaming schoolchildren -- and what you have is the same ultra-white party that shocked many Americans' sensibilities at the 1992 and 1996 conventions. The deluge of black and Latin faces on display in Philadelphia is deceptive, given that the party's delegates and senior managers are as white as they have ever been.</p>
        <p>Even so, the realization among the party fathers that Americans have grown uncomfortable with unremitting whiteness is a breakthrough in itself. The problem for the G.O.P. is how to move from patronizing spectacles like this one, in which blacks and Latinos serve as props, to a state of affairs where minority Americans are both welcomed and actively recruited into the party as full-fledged participants. Given the party's recent history of code words and writing off the minority vote, it will take more than break dancers on the convention stage to change this picture.</p>

        <p>The African-Americans and Latinos being paraded across the stage at the Republican Convention are intended to give a hip, multicultural feel -- and dispel the pervasive notion that the G.O.P. is largely a party of, by and for white Americans. But subtract the minority props -- the break dancers and the gospel choir and the beaming schoolchildren -- and what you have is the same ultra-white party that shocked many Americans' sensibilities at the 1992 and 1996 conventions. The deluge of black and Latin faces on display in Philadelphia is deceptive, given that the party's delegates and senior managers are as white as they have ever been.</p>
        <p>Even so, the realization among the party fathers that Americans have grown uncomfortable with unremitting whiteness is a breakthrough in itself. The problem for the G.O.P. is how to move from patronizing spectacles like this one, in which blacks and Latinos serve as props, to a state of affairs where minority Americans are both welcomed and actively recruited into the party as full-fledged participants. Given the party's recent history of code words and writing off the minority vote, it will take more than break dancers on the convention stage to change this picture.</p>
        <p>This seemingly colorized convention in Philadelphia is in fact very white, with black voters accounting for 4 percent of the delegates and  Asians about 2 percent. It may seem difficult to believe, but the Philadelphia convention is whiter than the convention of 1992, whose whiteness provoked many voters to reject the G.O.P. in favor of the multicultural Democrats. Indeed, the Philadelphia convention is whiter even than the convention of 1912, when 6 percent of the delegates were black. That gathering sent William Howard Taft into his doomed re-election run and resulted in the worst defeat ever experienced by an incumbent.</p>
        <p>Some in the party, angered that Taft had defeated the comeback effort of their favorite, former President Theodore Roosevelt, engineered a change in the rules. This undercut the strength of the South, where most black voters, many of whom were Republicans, still lived. The 6 percent figure for black delegates has been a high-water mark since then.</p>
        <p>Black people were pushed further and further away, beginning in the 1960's, when the G.O.P. adopted its famed Southern strategy and sought to portray the Democrats as hostile to white Southern interests. This alienation reached its zenith in the 1980's, when the party used divisive tactics as a way of getting out the white vote.</p>
        <p>This strategy was helpful in the short term. But it ignored demographic and attitudinal changes that would soon make it self-defeating. First, white Americans, who make up about 80 percent of the population today, are a steadily shrinking majority, losing ground to Americans of Latin, Asian and African descent. The inevitable ''browning'' of America is happening fastest among school-age children, where nonwhites will become the majority by the year 2050. The Democrats went where the votes were, and by now their party enrollment shows it. The Democratic National Committee is 21 percent blacks, with blacks and Latinos in the highest positions throughout the party.</p>
        <p>The G.O.P. has given lip service to correcting this imbalance, awarding blacks and women largely symbolic positions in the party, typically through auxiliaries like the New Majority Council, where black people are isolated in outreach efforts, with little or no effect on policy. The Republican National Committee, for example, has few black members, most from the Virgin Islands and only one from the mainland United States.</p>
        <p>The stage in Philadelphia is brimming with minority faces. But among the delegates and in the convention hall the crowds are unremittingly white. Black people have been strategically placed throughout the hall to show up on television, next to George and Barbara Bush, for example, or near other important Republicans.</p>
        <p>As at the last convention, the Oklahoma Republican J. C. Watts is omnipresent, this time as the master of ceremonies, but close viewers of these events are beginning to notice that he is the only black Republican elected official of any national standing involved in these proceedings.</p>
        <p>For many African-Americans, this strategic deployment of blacks as props and symbols suggests a symbolic form of minstrelsy, with a Republican Party that has historically dismissed black voters as irrelevant now seeking to erase that history by dressing up in blackface.</p>
        <p>The truth here is that the party has written off black voters for this election and is directing its entreaties to the white, moderate suburbanites who abandoned the party in the last two elections to vote for Bill Clinton. The ploy of cosmetically colorizing the G.O.P. could work once, but it is unlikely to work forever. As the nation browns, the Republican Party will either brown with it or be swept away.</p>
