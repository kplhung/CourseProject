        <p>''I don't expect to be very kinetic,'' Stanley Kunitz said, with a dry little laugh. A reporter was asking Mr. Kunitz what he would be doing in his new appointment as the nation's 10th poet laureate, which was announced on Monday.</p>
        <p>''Nor do I expect to traipse around the country,'' Mr. Kunitz said. Understandable perhaps, for he is 95 years old. ''I feel the best service that I can do is to continue to function as a poet.'' He is certainly doing that. There aren't many poets who sign three book contracts at age 92, as Mr. Kunitz did with his publisher, W. W. Norton.</p>

        <p>''I don't expect to be very kinetic,'' Stanley Kunitz said, with a dry little laugh. A reporter was asking Mr. Kunitz what he would be doing in his new appointment as the nation's 10th poet laureate, which was announced on Monday.</p>
        <p>''Nor do I expect to traipse around the country,'' Mr. Kunitz said. Understandable perhaps, for he is 95 years old. ''I feel the best service that I can do is to continue to function as a poet.'' He is certainly doing that. There aren't many poets who sign three book contracts at age 92, as Mr. Kunitz did with his publisher, W. W. Norton.</p>
        <p>And in October, when his appointment as poet laureate begins, Norton is to publish Mr. Kunitz's 12th book of poetry, a volume of ''Collected Poems.'' He would like to think there will be at least one book after that, ''in this millennium,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When Jay Parini, a poet, novelist and critic, was told about Mr. Kuntiz's appointment, he said: ''Every poet I know with any sense looks to Stanley Kunitz and says that's the way to think about a poetic career. In other words, total devotion to the craft itself, not the slightest degree of affectation, a complete humility in his work. There's never a moment when you say, 'He's faking it,' or 'He's doing this to impress me.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kunitz succeeds Robert Pinsky, and this is actually his second time round as the nation's top poet. From 1974 to 1976, he was Consultant in Poetry at the Library of Congress, before the words poet laureate were added to the job title. He has also won just about every other honor possible for a poet, including a Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and the Bollingen Prize. But for many years, he was overlooked in favor of more famous contemporaries, like W. H. Auden and Robert Lowell.</p>
        <p>Still, there are critics who believe that Mr. Kunitz's work has gotten better over time. ''I've learned to strip the water out of my poems,'' he has said. Indeed, in recent years, his writing has become sparer, less formal, more direct, in a sense, purer. There are no rhyme schemes, no complicated metrical designs. In one typical poem, ''The Wellfleet Whale,'' he describes the cries of a whale lying stranded on the beach, as ''an eerie medley of clicks/and hoots and trills,/ location-notes and love calls,/whistles and grunts. Occasionally,/ it's like furniture being smashed.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes Mr. Kunitz's work is lyrical and sensuous too, as in ''Touch Me.''</p>
        <p>Summer is late, my heart.</p>
        <p>Words plucked out of the air</p>
        <p>some forty years ago</p>
        <p>when I was wild with love.</p>
        <p>At the end of the poem he asks,</p>
        <p>Darling, do you remember</p>
        <p>The man you married? Touch me,</p>
        <p>remind me who I am.</p>
        <p>He was born in Worcester, Mass., the son of a manufacturer who killed himself before Mr. Kunitz was born. He has written about the anguish the suicide caused his family. He went on to graduate from Harvard, served in the military and was for briefly a newspaper man.</p>
        <p>''One of my primary thoughts through the years has been that I am living and dying at once,'' he said. ''It began long before I was an aging man. It's continuing. Perhaps the mix gets a bit different.'' He cites his poem, ''The Layers,'' as an example:</p>
        <p>In a rising wind</p>
        <p>the manic dust of my friends,</p>
        <p>those who fell along the way,</p>
        <p>bitterly stings my face.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kunitz is married to Elise Asher, 88, his third wife, an artist and poet. Each has a child from a previous marriage, and ''a bowlful of grandchildren and even great-grandchildren,'' he said. ''They're all going to be up here soon,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The couple gets by without a housekeeper. ''We work together and manage our lives as best we can.'' They have homes in Greenwich Village and Provincetown, Mass., where Mr. Kunitz enjoys his other passion, gardening.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe in writing every day,'' he said, ''though I'm at my desk every day. So much of writing is thinking before you write, reading or simply brooding.''</p>
        <p>''I'm a night worker,'' he said. ''I love the sense of solitude and the silence. ''I love to think that here I am alive and burning and the rest of the world is asleep.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kunitz, who is slender and fit-looking, said he had no special prescription for good health or longevity. ''I don't pay much attention to exercise or diet,'' he said, though ''I'm famous for my martinis.''</p>
        <p>''I think what keeps me going is my caring about being alive and caring about the world. And the fact that I love being here, that's all.''</p>
        <p>His poem ''The Long Boat,'' expresses it all, he said. In the poem, he imagines lying down in a cradle with the family ghosts, ''buffeted by the storm, endlessly drifting.''</p>
        <p>And at the end, it is ''As if it didn't matter/ which way was home;/ as if he didn't know/ he loved the earth so much/ he wanted to stay forever.''</p>
        <p>Remembrance: 'The Layers'</p>
        <p>I have walked through many lives,</p>
        <p>some of them my own,</p>
        <p>and I am not who I was,</p>
        <p>though some principle of being</p>
        <p>abides, from which I struggle</p>
        <p>not to stray.</p>
        <p>When I look behind,</p>
        <p>as I am compelled to look</p>
        <p>before I can gather strength</p>
        <p>to proceed on my journey,</p>
        <p>I see the milestones dwindling</p>
        <p>toward the horizon</p>
        <p>and the slow fires trailing</p>
        <p>from the abandoned campsites,</p>
        <p>over which scavenger angles</p>
        <p>wheel on heavy wings.</p>
        <p>Oh, I have made myself a tribe</p>
        <p>out of my true affections,</p>
        <p>and my tribe is scattered!</p>
        <p>How shall the heart be reconciled</p>
        <p>to its feast of losses?</p>
        <p>In a rising wind</p>
        <p>the manic dust of my friends,</p>
        <p>those who fell along the way,</p>
        <p>bitterly stings my face.</p>
        <p>Yet I turn, I turn,</p>
        <p>exulting somewhat,</p>
        <p>with my will intact to go</p>
        <p>wherever I need to go,</p>
        <p>and every stone on the road</p>
        <p>precious to me.</p>
        <p>In my darkest night,</p>
        <p>when the moon was covered</p>
        <p>and I roamed through wreckage,</p>
        <p>a nimbus-clouded voice</p>
        <p>directed me:</p>
        <p>''Live in the layers,</p>
        <p>not on the litter.''</p>
        <p>Though I lack the art</p>
        <p>to decipher it,</p>
        <p>no doubt the next chapter</p>
        <p>in my book of transformations</p>
        <p>is already written.</p>
        <p>I am not done with my changes.</p>
        <p>(From ''Next-to-Last Things,'' 1985)</p>
