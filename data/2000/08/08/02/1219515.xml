        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio stopped by his party's convention for a few brief hours today, seizing the chance to raise money for his Senate campaign and to rally supporters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, Republican of Long Island, also tried to increase his visibility against his high-profile opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, by giving several television interviews.</p>
        <p>Early, he seemed unrestrained by national Republican efforts to avoid criticism of the Clintons. Instead, Mr. Lazio told New York delegates at a brunch, ''We've been here about a day, probably longer than Hillary Clinton has been in New York.''</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Lazio was far more guarded, telling a mass of journalists that he was taking the high road, compared with what he considered the negativity of his opponent.</p>
        <p>He attracted people curious to see the man in political combat with the first lady, though more than a smattering were unsure who he was.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio ventured inside the hall, though far from the podium, where some Republicans felt he belonged.</p>
        <p>Asked about the Republican Party's platform, which, among other points that differ from Mr. Lazio's positions, opposes abortion, Mr. Lazio said, ''I think the platform, frankly, has become largely obsolete.'' But he cited only the abortion plank as problematic, adding, ''I think the party platform is going to be determined by Governor Bush.'' (Mr. Lazio does oppose public financing for abortions and late-term procedures.)</p>
        <p>Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, later explained that Mr. Lazio considered the concept of platforms obsolete, not the content.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio faced numerous questions about his brief visit, and he restated that he would not be here on Thursday for Gov. George W. Bush's acceptance speech. Some have suggested that the Lazio campaign was irritated that he was not offered a greater role. But Mr. Lazio said:  ''My job is to get back to New York. That's where the votes are. I'm not running for national office here.''</p>
        <p>Some of his prominent Republican allies, including Dick Armey, the House majority leader, said they were disappointed in Mr. Lazio's limited role. Mr. Armey hugged Mr. Lazio and called him ''one of my one or two best friends in the House.''</p>
        <p>Organizers ''tried to allocate spots to guys who needed the exposure,'' Mr. Armey said of the schedule. ''Rick doesn't really need it.''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Mr. Lazio is scheduled to appear on a WWOR program led by Bob Grant, who has drawn controversy over remarks he has made about blacks.</p>
        <p>His opponent's staff regarded Mr. Lazio's convention appearance as a sign of his ties to what they consider the conservative party leadership.</p>
        <p>''Which part of the Bush-Cheney ticket does he support?'' asked Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman. ''Does he support a risky tax scheme that would make a U-turn for our economy?''</p>
