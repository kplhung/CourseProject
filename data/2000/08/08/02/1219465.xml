        <p>Retailers at Roosevelt Field mall in Garden City, N.Y., used to be in a bind whenever they detected a shoplifter or someone writing bad checks: The only way they could alert one another was through a telephone system that would automatically relay a recorded message from one store's telephone to another.</p>
        <p>With about 260 stores of varying sizes, the Long Island mall's cumbersome alert system could easily take an hour to reach the last store on the list, said Joseph P. Cilia, the mall's manager.</p>
        <p>That alert system, however, will soon become as much a relic of the past as nondigital cash registers. The mall is nearing the end of a large wiring project that should be fully functional this month, and that is expected to help retailers there overcome a variety of communication hurdles, not just speedily spread the word about shoplifters.</p>
        <p>In stockrooms and corridors invisible to the mall's customers, and in an underground truck tunnel underneath it, more than six miles of high-capacity wire have been installed. An electronics room situated in the center of the mall has been designed to allow for a 600 percent increase in capacity as more features are eventually added to the system.</p>
        <p>The project is a product of an industry coalition, MerchantWired, which was founded earlier this year to build what its members hope will become a standard for the retail industry -- a nationwide, high-speed communications network that will provide a secure and reliable connection for retailers, their corporate offices, consumers and the Internet.</p>
        <p>According to Robert Covington, executive vice president of business development at MerchantWired, in Indianapolis, most retailers, like those at Roosevelt Field, still operate as ''islands of communication,'' because they lack the ability to tie into such a network.</p>
        <p>Arthur Coppola, president of the Macerich Company, a member of the MerchantWired coalition that owns 58 shopping malls nationwide, agreed. For example, Mr. Coppola said, to check on the status of an item at some remote location, like another store, retailers now generally are unable to call up quickly the information they need on a computer screen. They usually have to make a phone call.</p>
        <p>The Macerich Company, a real estate investment trust that is based in Santa Monica, Calif., is one of seven coalition members. The other six are the Rouse Company, Taubman Centers, Urban Shopping Centers Inc., Westcor Partners, Westfield America and Simon Property Group, which owns the mall at Roosevelt Field. MerchantWired has also established three strategic partnerships for building its network, with Cisco Systems Inc., I.B.M., and Intermedia Communications, of Tampa, Fla.</p>
        <p>MerchantWired uses broadband technology, which allows for simultaneous voice, video and data transmission, Mr. Covington said. And as such, he said, the network may let retailers like those at Roosevelt Field fulfill a number of communication needs at the same time, whether it meant accessing a company's point-of-sale inventory management system, or providing real-time training broadcasts from a retailer's corporate office, or allowing consumers to stroll through a mall with a handheld device and shop for items without ever entering a store.</p>
        <p>Mr. Covington said MerchantWired's transmission speed was at least 10 times faster now than even the satellite technology that some retailers use (other retailers still rely on dial-up modems). For example, he said, retailers that are part of MerchantWired's network can verify credit-card purchases in 2 seconds or less, compared with the 20 to 30 seconds that are now generally required.</p>
        <p>At Roosevelt Field, the broadband wiring took less than a week, said John W. Little, a networking strategist at I.B.M. who is running that company's efforts for MerchantWired. He said the cable that was laid down at the mall looked similar to television cable, except that it was both higher quality and had four layers of metal shielding to prevent noise and interference.</p>
        <p>Executives at MerchantWired said Roosevelt Field's wiring required 6.63 miles of cable. They declined to say how much the wiring cost, but added that they still had not decided how much MerchantWired would cost retailers.</p>
        <p>Built in 1956, the mall at Roosevelt Field has 2.3 million square feet of retail space and gets about 20 million visitors a year, or roughly 60,000 a day. A second floor was added in 1993 and a Nordstrom department store in 1996.</p>
        <p>The wiring project was nowhere near as disruptive as those renovations. Mr. Cilia, the mall's manager, said MerchantWired did virtually all its wiring behind the scenes, thanks to an intricate set of back corridors, service areas and loading docks that link the mall's tenants. One of those corridors, he said, is an underground circular truck tunnel that runs the entire length of the mall and that eliminates the need for above-ground loading docks.</p>
        <p>He said he expected that the network would eventually bring more customers to his mall, who would spend more time shopping, once they have access to some of the consumer-oriented technologies that MerchantWired had been testing at other malls around the country. They include handheld scanners that might relieve consumers of the burden of having to carry many packages. Shoppers could scan and buy items online for delivery to their homes.</p>
