        <p>With pressure mounting to rid New York City's most troubled schools of uncertified teachers by September, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy announced a plan yesterday to lure experienced instructors from private and parochial schools by increasing the starting salaries they can earn if they transfer into the city's poorest schools.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy's announcement came as a state judge temporarily barred him from allowing unlicensed teachers to work in 99 troubled schools in the coming school year, which begins Sept. 7. The judge, Gloria C. Aronin of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, issued the temporary restraining order yesterday after Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, sued the Board of Education.</p>

        <p>With pressure mounting to rid New York City's most troubled schools of uncertified teachers by September, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy announced a plan yesterday to lure experienced instructors from private and parochial schools by increasing the starting salaries they can earn if they transfer into the city's poorest schools.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy's announcement came as a state judge temporarily barred him from allowing unlicensed teachers to work in 99 troubled schools in the coming school year, which begins Sept. 7. The judge, Gloria C. Aronin of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, issued the temporary restraining order yesterday after Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, sued the Board of Education.</p>
        <p>In court papers, Mr. Mills charged that the board had violated a new state law by hiring nearly 600 unlicensed teachers to work in the 99 underperforming schools, mostly in Brooklyn and the Bronx, last year. Also, he argued, the board did not provide any guarantee that those teachers would be replaced this fall, and that any extra vacancies would be filled with certified teachers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said he was surprised by the suit but his new effort to recruit parochial and private school teachers would ''go a long way toward solving the problem.'' The plan, which Mr. Levy negotiated this week with the United Federation of Teachers and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, changes a longtime cap on starting salaries for experienced teachers who transfer into the city schools.</p>
        <p>Because of the cap, all certified teachers transferring into the system started out earning a salary commensurate with only five years of experience -- about $39,000 -- no matter how much experience they had. But now, teachers with more than seven years of experience who transfer into the 99 underperforming schools will start out with a higher salary, earning $48,000.</p>
        <p>''I think there are a significant number of teachers who would long ago have transferred to the public school system if the economic gain was larger,'' Mr. Levy said. ''Teachers at Dalton, Trinity and Regis who want to help children in need will see this higher-pay package as a way to do the work they love without having to make a financial sacrifice.''</p>
        <p>Richard Blumenthal, the headmaster at the Dalton School, was out of town yesterday and could not be reached for comment. But other private schools leaders said they did not think that the new salary incentive would be enough to draw private-school teachers into the city's failing schools. ''The failing schools that the chancellor needs teachers for are such a different world that I don't think they'd be an attractive option for our teachers,'' said Dorothy A. Hutcheson, head of Nightingale-Bamford, a private school for girls on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hutcheson said she was more concerned about losing teachers to suburban public schools, which offer not only much higher salaries but also comfortable working conditions.</p>
        <p>Nora Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York's education office, responded angrily to Mr. Levy's plan.  Teachers at Catholic schools sign contracts in the spring promising to return the following fall, she said, so the plan is effectively urging them to break those contracts.</p>
        <p>Told of Ms. Murphy's comments, Mr. Levy said, ''The last I looked it was a free market, and people have the ability to decide where they want to work.''</p>
        <p>Of the 577 uncertified teachers hired last year to work in the 99 underperforming schools, roughly 250 have been reassigned. The Board of Education has urged the remaining teachers to apply to a new alternative certification program that the state approved last month. But to participate, they would have to pass two state certification exams by the start of the school year.</p>
        <p>Many of these teachers have repeatedly failed the certification exams, and state education officials say the alternative certification program will not begin to solve the problem. Besides ordering Mr. Levy to  replace uncertified teachers who were hired for the 99 troubled schools last year, Mr. Mills is also ordering Mr. Levy to fill any new vacancies in those schools with certified teachers. Board officials said yesterday that they did not know how many vacancies they would have to fill in September. But last year, there were 1,400 vacancies in those schools, out of a total 6,000 teaching positions.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Mills praised Mr. Levy's incentive plan for parochial and private-school teachers yesterday, but added that Mr. Levy should consider transferring experienced teachers from other city schools into the 99 troubled schools -- even if they did not want to go.</p>
        <p>Board officials say the teachers' contract prevents them from forcing transfers. But Chris Carpenter, the spokesman for Mr. Mills, said the commissioner believed that they could find a way to do it.</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the teachers' union, warned that forcing teachers to transfer to troubled schools would ''outrage'' parents and compel the teachers to abandon New York City schools altogether. She praised Mr. Levy's plan, but said a better solution would be to significantly raise salaries for all 75,000 of the city's teachers.</p>
