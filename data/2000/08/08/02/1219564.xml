        <p>Dwight Gooden's revival continued last night, which meant that one of the most surprising developments of a long season continued for the Yankees. Gooden pitched seven competent innings for one of the best teams in baseball and made it difficult to fathom how he was unemployed before George Steinbrenner offered him one more chance.</p>
        <p>Of course, Gooden has devoured the chance, has helped stabilize the Yankees and has made them look shrewd for believing in him again. While Gooden was impeccable last night at Yankee Stadium, the bullpen was not, so Gooden lost his chance for a victory when Mike Stanton frittered away a two-run bulge in the eighth and the Kansas City Royals rallied to tie the score.</p>

        <p>Dwight Gooden's revival continued last night, which meant that one of the most surprising developments of a long season continued for the Yankees. Gooden pitched seven competent innings for one of the best teams in baseball and made it difficult to fathom how he was unemployed before George Steinbrenner offered him one more chance.</p>
        <p>Of course, Gooden has devoured the chance, has helped stabilize the Yankees and has made them look shrewd for believing in him again. While Gooden was impeccable last night at Yankee Stadium, the bullpen was not, so Gooden lost his chance for a victory when Mike Stanton frittered away a two-run bulge in the eighth and the Kansas City Royals rallied to tie the score.</p>
        <p>But Scott Brosius saved Stanton by hammering a homer off Ricky Bottalico to lead off the bottom of the eighth and vault the Yankees to a dramatic 5-4 victory. Since Brosius had stranded six runners in his first three at-bats and had not homered in 14 games, he tossed the bat aside, raised his arms in the air like Rocky Balboa and scampered around the bases.</p>
        <p>''It was one of those times where you could walk away with a smile after struggling a bit,'' Brosius said.</p>
        <p>Gooden could definitely smile after continuing to do something that was supposed to be a surprise, and is now looking more and more like a routine. He had a sturdy fastball, precise control and enormous confidence, allowing one earned run and four hits in his longest outing of the season. He gave Manager Joe Torre enough evidence to prove that the 35-year-old Gooden should stay in the rotation.</p>
        <p>Torre admitted that he never expected Gooden to be in a pivotal position. But Gooden, who signed a minor league contract in June, is 3-0 with a 1.86 earned run average for the Yankees after adding a changeup and being more aggressive. It will be difficult for Torre to remove him from the rotation, even if David Cone is excellent in his next start.</p>
        <p>''You can't top what he did tonight,'' Torre said about Gooden. ''It's fun for me to watch. I know he has to be thrilled about it.''</p>
        <p>After abominable stints with the Houston Astros and Tampa Bay Devil Rays and a near retirement, Gooden thought about what he had accomplished and said, ''It might sound crazy, but I'm more relaxed now.''</p>
        <p>Despite his superb pitching, Gooden knows that Orlando Hernandez, who is recovering from an injury, will return to the rotation and he would like to see Cone do so as well.  If Cone is in the five-man rotation, Gooden will not be.</p>
        <p>''I think that's their decision,'' Gooden said. ''I still feel we're a better team with me in the bullpen. That would mean that El Duque is healthy and Coney is back on track. I have no problem going to the bullpen.''</p>
        <p>With the Yankees trailing by 2-1 in the seventh, Chuck Knoblauch walked and stole second, and Royals starter Dan Reichert followed by walking Derek Jeter. After the left-hander Tim Byrdak struck out Paul O'Neill, Bernie Williams smashed a two-run double to left. David Justice followed with a double to make it 4-2, a refreshing change for the Yankees, who had stranded two in the fifth and three in the sixth after Brosius whiffed.</p>
        <p>Gooden was six outs from his fourth victory with the Yankees and he had thrown only 79 pitches, but Torre turned to Stanton in the eighth. A one-out single, a walk and Johnny Damon's booming double off the fence in right-center field, which was a few feet from being a three-run homer, tied the score, 4-4. The Royals later loaded the bases against Jeff Nelson, but Nelson fanned Joe Randa and pumped his fist as he returned to the dugout. All of the Yankees were celebrating a few moments later when Brosius belted Bottalico's 1-0 fastball over the left-field fence.</p>
        <p>The homer climaxed a long day for Brosius. His 8-year-old daughter, Allison, developed the concept for a fund-raiser called Yankees' Kids for Kids, which was introduced yesterday. The Yankees put canisters at more than 50 locations throughout the Stadium for donations to buy toys for local children who are in the hospital. Allison and her father videotaped a message describing the effort that was shown on the scoreboard during the game.</p>
        <p>''People definitely got enough of the Brosius family tonight with all that was going on,'' Brosius said. ''From here on out, we'll be less visible.''</p>
        <p>Even though Gooden did not get the victory, the Yankees were giddy because a reclamation project from the Devil Rays was pitching as well as anyone else on their staff. Gooden was dejected when the Royals took a 2-0 lead in the fifth, a sign of how much he expects of himself now. Gooden's revival continued, but will he stay in the rotation?</p>
        <p>''I like tough decisions,'' Torre said. ''There are other clubs struggling to know who they'll start next week. If we have a lot of choices, I like that. It's going to be tough. Right now, I don't know what I'm going to do.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>ORLANDO HERNANDEZ (sprained elbow and back spasms) pitched four shutout innings in a Class A game yesterday and felt no pain. Hernandez struck out five and walked one in a 49-pitch effort, and his fastball reached 92 miles an hour. The Yankees will decide today if he should rejoin the team or make another rehab start. . . . RYAN THOMPSON was relieved that the Yankees did not acquire a left fielder. ''You know how they say you have a monkey on your back?'' Thompson said. ''I had a gorilla. But I still have to show these guys. I have to impress them.''</p>
