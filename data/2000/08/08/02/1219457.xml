        <p>If ABC wanted to generate a buzz by bringing Dennis Miller to ''Monday Night Football,'' it got it.</p>
        <p>The first wave came in June when the network hired the comedian.</p>
        <p>The second came with his debut Monday night from Canton, Ohio, where the New England Patriots played the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
        <p>USA Today placed the Miller story atop its front page yesterday, and employed a six-person reporting team to record reaction in New York, Seattle, Philadelphia, Cheney, Wash., and Washington.</p>
        <p>The dawn of Miller Time was judged more important at the national newspaper than the Republican National Convention or the failure of a no-confidence vote in the Israeli parliament against Prime Minister Ehud Barak.</p>
        <p>Maybe Miller's political gibes won him USA Today's top spot: he called the Democrats and the Republicans ''4-12 teams'' and said George W. Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, possessed the same ''deer-in-the-headlights look'' shown by the 49ers' backup quarterback, Giovanni Carmazzi.</p>
        <p>Thousands of people cared enough to register their opinion about Miller, a profane and witty comic whose trademark is a topical rant on his weekly HBO program, which he has parlayed into best-selling books.</p>
        <p>At least three Web sites conducted Miller polls. In a survey of 70,000 America Online members, 29.6 percent said Miller was ''fine and adds something to the telecast,'' but 25.9 percent said he was ''bad'' and suggested that ABC find someone new.</p>
        <p>But 37.2 percent said the new ''Monday Night'' threesome of Miller, Al Michaels and Dan Fouts was ''no better or worse'' than last year's Michaels-Boomer Esiason team. Esiason was fired in March. The fans' favorite ''Monday Night'' crew? Howard Cosell, Frank Gifford and Don Meredith, with 36.2 percent of the votes.</p>
        <p>At ESPN.com, 38.4 percent of more than 158,000 online voters gave Miller a B for his performance, while 25.6 percent graded him a C. Eleven percent flunked him.</p>
        <p>At CNN/SI.com, 45 percent of the 12,584 who voted dubbed Miller great, but 26 percent sent a loud message: ''Bring Boomer back.'' The Web site augmented its survey with a digest of eight newspaper critiques of Miller's performance.</p>
        <p>ABC Sports said about 50 newspaper critics weighed in on Miller, focusing on a single subject the way they do only for the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>The most withering assessment came from Leonard Shapiro of The Washington Post: ''Hired last month to act as a lightning rod for what has become a tranquil telecast, Miller's presence created barely enough electricity to power a flashlight, let alone jump-start ABC's marquee pro football attraction.''</p>
        <p>Networks can't orchestrate such interest -- and since hiring Miller, ABC has worked to reduce expectations by refusing interview requests for him -- especially for a comedian analyzing a preseason game.</p>
        <p>But seven weeks of anticipation of what Miller would say and how he would behave guaranteed more attention than ''Monday Night'' has garnered in a long time.</p>
        <p>ABC is banking that he will be a 21st century version of Cosell -- or will at least be a reliable voice of outrageousness. At XTRA, a sports radio station in San Diego, Lee Hamilton, a talk show host, said a large majority of callers viewed Miller negatively, some complaining that his commentary was sacrilegious to the church of ''Monday Night.''</p>
        <p>Miller's debut spurred at least 150 viewers to leave messages overnight -- more than the usual 90 -- mostly to register their displeasure. Adam Freifeld, a spokesman for ABC Sports, said that most of the calls to ABC are routinely negative, and these followed suit. Another 25 to 30 e-mail messages were received.</p>
        <p>But one measure of interest slipped. The rating for the New England-San Francisco game tumbled 28 percent to a 7.3 from a 10.1 last year when Cleveland played Dallas in a close overtime game. ABC started Monday's game at 7 p.m. Eastern, an hour earlier than last year, a shift that lost viewers. The rating peaked with a 7.8 rating from 9 to 9:30.</p>
