        <p>WHEN it comes to grilling, Americans achieve flavor through a free-handed use of rubs, pastes and marinades. Asians take a more internal approach. They grill their kebabs on skewers made of flavorful grasses and herbs.</p>
        <p>I first encountered this practice in Bali, where roadside cooks grill seafood mousse kebabs called sate lilit. An explosively flavorful mix of pureed fish and spices is molded onto stalks of fresh lemon grass, then grilled over coconut shell charcoal. The lemon grass perfumes the sate from the inside out, and you get a blast of flavor as you nibble the mousse off the skewer.</p>

        <p>WHEN it comes to grilling, Americans achieve flavor through a free-handed use of rubs, pastes and marinades. Asians take a more internal approach. They grill their kebabs on skewers made of flavorful grasses and herbs.</p>
        <p>I first encountered this practice in Bali, where roadside cooks grill seafood mousse kebabs called sate lilit. An explosively flavorful mix of pureed fish and spices is molded onto stalks of fresh lemon grass, then grilled over coconut shell charcoal. The lemon grass perfumes the sate from the inside out, and you get a blast of flavor as you nibble the mousse off the skewer.</p>
        <p>Likewise, the Vietnamese grill a delicately flavored shrimp mousse on broad, flat lengths of sugar cane. These kebabs, called chao tom, offer a stunning contrast of textures and flavors: the refreshing crunch of the sugar cane versus the soft succulence of the mousse, the briny tang of the seafood against the sweetness of the cane juice. As with the lemon grass in sate lilit, you don't really eat the sugar cane, but chew it a little to release the juice.</p>
        <p>This dish made me think about other uses for sugar cane, specifically the sugar cane swizzle sticks that are sold at specialty shops. The thin, square-sided sticks make perfect skewers; all you need to do is cut off one end sharply on the diagonal to help ease the skewer through the food.</p>
        <p>Taking my inspiration from chao tom, I created a sort of Caribbean dish by skewering whole shrimp on the cane and basting them with a rum-mustard glaze. These offbeat kebabs make great appetizers at a cookout, and assembling them is a snap. Just make a starter hole with a metal or bamboo skewer in the item being skewered.</p>
        <p>Sprigs of fresh rosemary also make excellent skewers, with stems slender enough to pass through a small item like a scallop, yet stiff enough to hold chunks of chicken or seafood. The heat of the fire releases the rosemary oils, which infuse the kebab with flavor. You can use fresh rosemary sprigs from a greengrocer, but you'll get longer, stiffer skewers if you cut them from a rosemary plant, which will keep growing.</p>
        <p>Once you start thinking about flavorful skewers, there's no limit to where your imagination will take you. Mine takes me to my spice rack. With fresh peaches in season, I reckoned that whole cinnamon sticks would be just the thing for skewering peaches or nectarines for grilling. For that matter, you could use sections of vanilla bean as a flavorful skewer for chunks of banana.  Who ever said that you can't grill dessert?</p>
        <p>ROSEMARY-GRILLED SCALLOPS  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>1 1/2 pounds sea scallops (about 30)  About 30 fresh rosemary sprigs (each 3 to 4 inches long)  3 ounces prosciutto, sliced paper thin  3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>1. Pull off and discard crescent-shaped muscle on side of each scallop that has one. Strip leaves off bottom 2 inches of rosemary sprigs (slide them off with your thumb and forefinger). Reserve leaves, and set sprigs  aside. Cut prosciutto into strips just large enough to wrap around scallops (about 1 by 3 inches).</p>
        <p>2. Lay a scallop flat on a work surface. Wrap a piece of prosciutto around it. Skewer a rosemary sprig through prosciutto and scallop to other side. Repeat with remaining scallops. Arrange scallops in a baking dish.  Drizzle olive oil and lemon juice on both sides, sprinkle with rosemary leaves and season with salt and pepper. (Go easy on  salt, as prosciutto is fairly salty.) Marinate for 15 minutes, while you light grill.</p>
        <p>3. Set up grill for direct grilling, and preheat to high. Brush and oil grate. Arrange scallops on grate, and grill until just cooked, about 2 minutes a side. Serve at once.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 appetizer servings or 4 main course servings.</p>
        <p>PEACH KEBABS ON CINNAMON STICKS  Time: 15 minutes</p>
        <p>8 large ripe freestone peaches  8 cinnamon sticks  8 fresh mint leaves  4 tablespoons salted butter  4 tablespoons brown sugar  4 tablespoons bourbon  1 teaspoon lime juice  Peach or vanilla ice cream.</p>
        <p>1. Cut peaches in half, and remove stone. Cut each peach half in half. Using a metal skewer, make a starter hole in center of each peach quarter. Skewer two peach quarters on each cinnamon stick, placing a mint leaf between each.</p>
        <p>2. Prepare bourbon butter glaze. Combine butter, sugar, bourbon and lime juice in a saucepan, and boil until thick and syrupy, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Set up grill for direct grilling, and preheat to high. Brush and oil grate. Grill peaches until nicely browned on both sides, 2 to 4 minutes a side, basting with glaze. Serve at once, with ice cream.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>PLANTATION SHRIMP ON SUGAR CANE SKEWERS  Time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>24 extra-large shrimp (1 1/2 pounds), peeled and deveined  2 tablespoons vegetable oil  2 tablespoons fresh lime juice  1 clove garlic, minced  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  For the glaze:</p>
        <p>1/2 cup dark brown sugar  1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces</p>
        <p>1/2 cup dark rum  3 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard  1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon each cinnamon, ground cloves and black pepper  Pinch of salt  12 sugar cane swizzle sticks (see note).</p>
        <p>1. Place shrimp in a mixing bowl and stir in  oil, lime juice, garlic, salt and pepper. Marinate 15 minutes while you prepare glaze and  skewers.</p>
        <p>2. Place ingredients for glaze in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer until thick and syrupy, 4 to 6 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Cut swizzle sticks in half widthwise, and cut one end off each piece sharply on diagonal. Resulting skewers should be about 5 inches long and  1/4 inch wide.</p>
        <p>4. Set up grill for direct grilling, and preheat to high. Using a metal skewer, make two starter holes in each shrimp, one toward  head end, one toward tail. Insert a sugar cane skewer through holes. Repeat with  remaining shrimp.</p>
        <p>5. Brush and oil grill grate. Grill shrimp kebabs until cooked, about 2 minutes a side, generously basting with glaze. Serve any remaining glaze as a sauce on the side.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 appetizer servings, 4 light main course servings.</p>
        <p>Note: Sugar cane swizzle sticks are sold at Citarella stores for $3.99 for 10 to 12 sticks.  Gourmet Garage stores also carry them, in packages of 8 to 10 sticks for $2.99.</p>
        <p>FISH MOUSSE GRILLED ON LEMON GRASS (SATE LILIT)  Time: 40 to 60 minutes, plus 2 hours' chilling</p>
        <p>2 to 3 shallots, peeled and sliced ( 1/2 cup)  3 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced  1 to 2 Thai or Serrano chilies, sliced  2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon powdered turmeric  5 macadamia nuts  2 teaspoons ground coriander</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon black pepper  1 teaspoon shrimp paste or anchovy paste or 1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste  1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil  12 ounces firm, fresh boneless white fish fillets, like snapper, mahi-mahi, bass or catfish</p>
        <p>1/2 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined</p>
        <p>1/4 cup coconut milk  1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, or to taste  2 kaffir lime leaves, cut into thin slivers (or  1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest)  4 teaspoons light brown sugar  24 stalks lemon grass, leaves and roots trimmed off, each about 7 inches long.</p>
        <p>1. Prepare spice paste. In a food processor finely grind shallots, garlic, chilies, ginger, turmeric, macadamia nuts, coriander, pepper, shrimp or anchovy paste (if using fish sauce, add it in Step 2) and salt. Heat oil in a wok. Stir-fry mixture over medium heat until dark and fragrant, 6 to 8 minutes.  Transfer to a bowl, and let cool.</p>
        <p>2. Prepare fish mousse. Puree fish and shrimp in food processor. Add spice paste, and puree. Work in coconut milk, lime juice, kaffir lime leaves and sugar. Taste mixture for seasoning, adding salt or lime juice to taste. It should be highly seasoned. Chill  mixture for 2 hours.</p>
        <p>3. Lightly wet your hands. Take about 3 tablespoons mousse mixture in one hand, and mold it onto bulbous part of lemon grass stalk about 3 inches long). Repeat with remaining stalks. Place finished sates on a plate lined with plastic wrap. Cover with more plastic wrap.</p>
        <p>4. Preheat grill to high. Brush and oil grate.  Grill sates until mousse is nicely browned and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes a side. If  fish mixture sticks to grate, use a metal spatula to turn sates. Serve at once.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 appetizer servings, 2 to 3 main course servings.</p>
