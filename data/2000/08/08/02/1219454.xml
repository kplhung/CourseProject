        <p>French investigators said yesterday that they had not found any engine parts in the trail of debris shed by an Air France Concorde on its brief flight before crashing near Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris on July 25.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the Bureau of Accident Investigations also said it had found no evidence of any ''particular problem before the departure of the flight.''</p>
        <p>The crew had radioed shortly before the crash that two engines were not working properly, raising the possibility that an engine had broken up in flight and thrown off parts that punctured a fuel tank or a fuel line; in that case, engine parts would have dropped on the ground. Some work had been done on an engine part, a thrust reverser, shortly before takeoff.</p>
        <p>But investigators are focusing on the possibility that tires burst and sent debris flying up into the fuel tanks or other parts, releasing fuel that allowed a spectacular fire to begin even before the plane had lifted off the runway.</p>
        <p>The French authorities reiterated yesterday that Air France's five remaining Concordes would stay grounded for the time being. British Airways, which had continued flying its seven Concordes, had to take one out of service yesterday because more work was needed on an engine that had been replaced over the weekend.</p>
