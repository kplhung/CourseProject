        <p>The day after the Republican National Convention opened with a call to ''leave no child behind,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton marveled at how familiar it all seemed.</p>
        <p>''I thought it sounded like the convention theme was 'It Takes a Village,' '' Mrs. Clinton said with a smirk, referring to the title of her book, which was ridiculed by conservatives when it was published in 1995.</p>
        <p>The official theme at the Philadelphia convention on Monday was actually ''Opportunity With a Purpose: Leave No Child Behind.'' The phrase ran through the remarks of many speakers, from experts on adoption and literacy to Gen. Colin L. Powell.</p>
        <p>''Many of the issues that were discussed and the way they were discussed were very much in line with what I've written about and talked about for 30 years,'' Mrs. Clinton said today on the first day of a three-day campaign trip on Long Island. ''I'm happy to have even rhetorical support for our mutual obligation to care for children.''</p>
        <p>The first lady's remarks came on the home turf of her Republican opponent for the United States Senate, Representative Rick A. Lazio. Mrs. Clinton is likely to have a much harder time winning votes on Republican-dominated Long Island, where the congressman was born and raised.</p>
        <p>''Underneath all of that soothing rhetoric are very different ideas about what we should do as a country,'' she told reporters after a lunch meeting of the Nassau County Village Officials Association here.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad we've moved the Republican Party rhetorically,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''But if you look at their Congressional agenda, if you look at their platform, if you look at what their nominee said when he started to run during the primary and the positions he signed onto, there are huge differences. And if the people of New York know the differences, the Democrats will do very well.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was accompanied by her daughter, Chelsea, for the first time since it was announced that Chelsea would take a leave from Stanford University to help her mother's campaign. Small crowds gathered around Ms. Clinton as she greeted well-wishers and posed for pictures with babies and elderly people.</p>
        <p>Just as Mrs. Clinton had stressed economic development in struggling upstate towns, she tailored her remarks today to the crowds of largely white, middle-aged and elderly Long Islanders, emphasizing issues like lowering taxes and her support for using the federal surplus to preserve Social Security and introduce prescription drug benefits for Medicare patients. She again mentioned a proposal, first outlined in Albany last month, that would change the formula to determine the state's share of federal Medicaid dollars.</p>
        <p>Absent from today's remarks were the issues she has stressed before black audiences over the last couple of days, like the 1986 vote in Congress by Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, against a resolution urging freedom for Nelson Mandela from a South African prison.</p>
        <p>While toning down what had been sharp criticism of Mr. Lazio, Mr. Cheney and Gov. George W. Bush, Mrs. Clinton said she had merely been pointing out facts.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's an attack to say Governor Bush went to Bob Jones University, Governor Bush supports the Republican platform and Supreme Court nominees who are dedicated to doing away with a woman's right to choose,'' she said. ''I don't think it's negative or an attack to say here are the facts and let people make their own judgment.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton seemed downright earnest, even returning, for the first time in months, to the slogan of her book. ''It takes a village to provide parks,'' she said earlier in the day during a campaign stop at a neighborhood park in Great Neck. ''It takes a village to keep the streets safe. It takes a village to provide teachers and resources necessary to educate our children.''</p>
        <p>''It takes a lot of villages,'' Mrs. Clinton observed, ''to help elect someone to the United States Senate.''</p>
