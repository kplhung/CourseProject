        <p>Abe Hirschfeld, the flamboyant parking garage developer, has never been one to go quietly. Nor did he yesterday when a Manhattan judge sentenced him to one to three years in prison for plotting to kill his business partner.</p>
        <p>Upon hearing the sentence, Mr. Hirschfeld asked for and was granted permission to kiss his wife, Zipora, but he refused to do so while handcuffed and kicked at court officers who would not free him. While he was being led away, he lavished a final obscenity upon the courtroom.</p>
        <p>For decades, Mr. Hirschfeld, 80, has courted trouble and defied crisis. In 1998, he offered Paula Corbin Jones $1 million to settle her lawsuit against President Clinton. Last year, after his trial on tax evasion charges ended with a deadlocked jury, he paid jurors $2,500 each for their work.</p>
        <p>And three years ago, according to evidence presented in the current case, he paid an intermediary $75,000 to hire a hit man to kill his associate Stanley Stahl, then 72. The two men had survivor-takes-control agreements covering many of their properties.</p>
        <p>A jury found Mr. Hirschfeld guilty of criminal solicitation on June 16.</p>
        <p>In court yesterday, Mr. Hirschfeld praised his own intellect and legacy in grandiose and disjointed remarks before he was sentenced. Judge Ira F. Beal of Criminal Court said, before he imposed sentence, ''This was a mean-spirited crime by a very wealthy man -- out of greed,'' and added, ''The community has a right to see some form of punishment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stahl was not killed, but died in August after a stroke. But Mr. Stahl's wife, Charisse, said yesterday in court, ''He is as responsible as if he shot a gun himself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stahl's life changed the day that he learned of Mr. Hirschfeld's intention to kill him, his wife said. He hired bodyguards, wore a bullet-proof vest and rode in a bullet-proof limousine. His health also declined, as he suffered from heart problems and pneumonia.</p>
        <p>Last August, she tried to keep him from seeing an article in New York magazine about Mr. Hirschfeld and his plot against Mr. Stahl. But on Aug. 5, he finally read it. ''After he got over being angry,'' she recalled, ''he said, 'I'm so happy to be home.' '' Then he went to the bathroom and fell to the floor, she said.  He had suffered a stroke and died 10 days later.</p>
        <p>Looking gaunt and pale, Mr. Hirschfeld challenged Mrs. Stahl's  statements. He said Mr. Stahl did not ride in a bullet-proof limousine, because he had never listed it as a business expense. He also denied having plotted to kill Mr. Stahl and said he had no financial incentive.  ''No one benefits from dying,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Then he said he had brought a copy of his own will. ''I am not going to leave my wife or child anything,'' he said. ''I'm going to build an immigrant hall of fame,'' in which he would feature himself.</p>
