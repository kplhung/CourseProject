        <p>You might mistake the Republican convention for an ethnic festival or a forum on women's rights,'' The New York Times said in a news story that seems to capture the scene in Philadelphia this week. Except this dispatch, reported by Maureen Dowd, didn't come from the convention that is nominating George W. Bush, but the one that nominated his father 12 years ago.</p>
        <p>The image of diverse Republican speakers is so at odds with the usual portrayal of the party that some people have concluded that something radical and significant must be going on. Last week, a Times story said the convention would ''showcase women and people from minority groups, faces that are not usually highlighted at Republican conventions.'' Actually, the last convention, in 1996, gave prominent roles to Susan Molinari, Colin Powell and Elizabeth Dole. And G.O.P. conventions have been showcasing women and minorities since at least the time of Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>The Republicans held their 1980 convention in Detroit, a city with a majority of black residents. In Dallas in 1984, women received the two longest speakers' slots. Trying to close the gender gap in 1988, Republicans gave over their podium to a parade of women and members of minority groups. Even the 1992 convention, now often characterized as a right-wing hate fest, featured an event called ''Black America Salutes the First Family'' and forced white male luminaries like Alfonse D'Amato and Howard Baker to surrender their credentials to make room for more female delegates.</p>
        <p>A convention is a television commercial, and the decision to feature black or female faces has barely any deeper philosophical import than the decision to feature balloons or confetti. In February, when Mr. Bush needed the support of conservative whites in South Carolina, he visited Bob Jones University and refused to denounce the Confederate flag. This doesn't mean that Mr. Bush is a secret racist; it simply reflected expediency in the choice of racial symbolism at that moment. Now the moment and the symbolism have changed.</p>
        <p>The best evidence that Mr. Bush has not fundamentally altered the direction of his party is the acquiescence of the G.O.P.'s right wing. Conservatives are so vigilant against creeping moderation that they have denounced Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott for ideological deviation. Not only is this group not barking out any complaints now, but it is nuzzled lovingly in Mr. Bush's lap. And no wonder. His positions on economics and judicial appointments hew firmly to the conservative line.</p>
        <p>Party diehards understand that it doesn't much matter if a blind mountain climber speaks in prime time while Mr. Lott is shunted to 11 a.m. Come next year, Mr. Lott, not the mountain climber, will be helping to set the G.O.P. legislative agenda.</p>
