        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The traditional narrative of the 60's, which J. Hoberman faithfully adheres to in his article, assumes that the revolt by the hippies and students was opposed by a moribund middle class and an increasingly conservative, hippie-hating working class.

        <p>Yes, there were Joes in the working class. But Mr. Hoberman ignores the signs that blue-collar workers were also in rebellion. In the years 1968-1973 there was a record number of both official and wildcat strikes, the intensity of which hadn't been seen since the 30's. Also, many blue-collar workers were rebelling in ways similar to the middle-class kids: smoking pot, growing their hair long, trying to undermine their bosses.</p>
