        <p>Score Educational Centers brought its after-school program to Harlem last month, when it opened at 121 West 125th Street (between Lenox Avenue and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard).</p>
        <p>The new center has 20 computer stations so members can use SuccessMaker, a computerized curriculum that is programmed to adjust to the level and abilities of individual students in kindergarten through 10th grade. Students can enroll at the Harlem location for $99 per month, in addition to a one-time family registration fee of $100, and attend two hourlong unscheduled sessions each week.
