        <p>Jennifer Whitehorn Minton, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Walter J. Minton of Saddle River, N.J., was married yesterday to Daniel Pfohl Quigley, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Leonard V. Quigley of Forest Hills, Queens. The Rev. Dr. Edwin M. Cromey performed the ceremony at St. Mary's-in-Tuxedo Episcopal Church in Tuxedo Park, N.Y., with Msgr. Edward Scharfenberger taking part.</p>
        <p>The bride, 29, is an editor at Vintage Books, a division of Alfred A. Knopf, in Manhattan. She graduated from Williams College. Her father, who is retired, was the president and chairman of G. P. Putnam's Sons, the publishing house in Manhattan. The bride is a descendant of Robert Morris, who signed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 30, received an M.B.A. in May from Columbia. Next month, he is to begin as a consultant in the Stamford, Conn., office of McKinsey &amp; Company, management consultants. He graduated from Duke University and was a Marine Corps captain stationed on Okinawa. His mother, Lynn Quigley, is an owner of Plaxall, a company in Long Island City, Queens, that manufactures plastics and develops real estate. His father is a partner in Paul, Weiss, Rifkin, Wharton &amp; Garrison, the Manhattan law firm.</p>
        <p>The couple attended the Groton School in Massachusetts together in the late 1980's, but were not close friends. They became reacquainted in October of 1996, when a fellow Groton alumnus gave a party in Manhattan. Just after arriving at the party, Ms. Minton swung open an interior door, hitting Mr. Quigley in the head. Stunned, but not hurt, he spent the rest of the party talking with her. A week later they went out on their first date.</p>
