        <p>AS the parting shot in a one-page news release, it almost went unnoticed: ''Putnam County is considered the safest county in the state of New York.''</p>
        <p>But from the cornfields of Tioga County, in northwest New York, to the bedroom neighborhoods of Madison County, in the geographic center of the state, the words drew a surprising response.</p>
        <p>''That seems kind of braggadocio,'' Peter L. Ward, the chairman of the County Legislature in Tioga, said of Putnam's declaration.</p>
        <p>The sheriff of Putnam County issued the statement in June, citing 1999 statistics in four crime categories. But in a follow-up interview, the sheriff, Robert Thouborron, admitted that his comments might have been made hastily. The state's Division of Criminal Justice Services has yet to issue its 1999 report, so Putnam's crime data cannot be compared with other counties.</p>
        <p>''If the headline is, 'Sheriff Misleads Public,' then you got me,'' Mr. Thoubboron said. ''We should have said we are one of the safest.''</p>
        <p>Taking credit for cutting crime is nothing new. Everyone from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to President Clinton has done it. The political and economic benefit of a perceived sense of safety is often the motive, criminologists say.</p>
        <p>But tiny increases or decreases in statistics, especially in counties or cities where the crime rate is already low, can cause dramatic swings in percentages that render them meaningless. For example, an increase of one violent crime a year would double the crime rate in Hamilton County but would barely be felt in a place like Yonkers.</p>
        <p>It's not that Putnam is lying.</p>
        <p>''When you deal with smaller jurisdictions like this, the numbers can fluctuate from year to year, quite wildly,'' said James Alan Fox, Lipman professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston. ''You have to take not just with a grain of salt but with the whole shaker of salt claims by a county saying that they are the safest.''</p>
        <p>According to the state's most recent report in 1998, four counties in New York had lower rates of violent crime per 100,000 people than Putnam: Hamilton, Madison, Schuyler and Tioga.</p>
        <p>Thomas M. Gifford, the chairman of the Schuyler County Legislature, said that he has known people who have moved to Schuyler from Putnam for safety.</p>
        <p>Michael J. Maloney, the Schuyler County sheriff, said he has not studied the numbers but believes ''we probably have the lowest amount of violent crime,'' in the state. In fact, its rate is the second lowest, after Hamilton.</p>
        <p>''You can walk around the streets here at night all by yourself and you don't have to worry about anybody driving up to you doing bodily harm,'' Mr. Gifford said.</p>
        <p>Of course, Schuyler County is so rural (it has 18,500 residents) that, as Mr. Gifford said, ''a lot of the streets here don't have lights, sidewalks or pavement.''</p>
        <p>In Putnam County, with a population of 93,000, Mr. Thoubboron said robberies were cut in half, to 7 last year from 14 in 1998. That is less than the number of robberies that can occur in one night in one police precinct in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Burglaries, Mr. Thoubboron said, dropped by 32 percent in Putnam, to 232 last year from 302 in 1998. Motor vehicle thefts went down 53 percent in the same period, he said.</p>
        <p>Those drops were on top of crime rates already among the state's lowest, according to the state's 1998 report on crime.</p>
        <p>Among counties with populations between 50,000 and 100,000, Putnam had the lowest index crime rate that year, a rate calculated by adding the total number of violent crimes to property crimes, dividing by the county population and multiplying by 100,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thoubboron ended his June 8 statement by saying Putnam's decrease ''is in large part due to the professional and dedicated law enforcement officers in the various departments that serve our community.'' Translation: good cops.</p>
        <p>But experts say crime often runs in cycles, its rates more a product of sociological trends than enforcement strategies. If a county wants to claim to be the safest, it must be safe in all areas of crime, not just four or five categories, said Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Melon University.</p>
        <p>''The one I find most reliable is homicide rates,'' Mr. Blumstein said.</p>
        <p>Putnam County had four homicides in 1999, according to the records provided by Mr. Thoubboron. One case, on New Year's Eve, was memorable for its horror: a Carmel woman killed her two sons, her husband and herself.</p>
        <p>When asked to recall the last homicide in Madison County (population 70,000) Rocco J. DiVeronica, the chairman of the county's Board of Supervisors, conceded he was stumped.</p>
        <p>''You mean just a regular outright murder?'' Mr. DiVeronica said. ''I don't know. About 13 years ago we had a brother killed a brother.</p>
        <p>''Boy, I know there's been some suicides,'' he added, pausing to think for a moment. ''That's an interesting question.''</p>
