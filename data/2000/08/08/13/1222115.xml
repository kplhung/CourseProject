        <p>Playhouse's Birthday</p>
        <p>An exhibition celebrating the 70-year history of the Westport Country Playhouse may be seen there through Oct. 28. The theater was founded in 1930 in an old barn by two experienced New York theater people -- Lawrence Langner, founder and director of the prestigious Theatre Guild, and his wife, Armina. In those days, there were dozens of so-called straw-hat theaters operating each summer throughout New York State, New England and elsewhere in the rustic fringes of major metropolises.</p>
        <p>But today Westport has one of the few that has survived, and by reorganizing and physically restoring the building as a year-round institution, it becomes one of a new breed of theaters generated by ex-urbanites who have developed sophisticated communitites in those same rustic fringes.</p>

        <p>Playhouse's Birthday</p>
        <p>An exhibition celebrating the 70-year history of the Westport Country Playhouse may be seen there through Oct. 28. The theater was founded in 1930 in an old barn by two experienced New York theater people -- Lawrence Langner, founder and director of the prestigious Theatre Guild, and his wife, Armina. In those days, there were dozens of so-called straw-hat theaters operating each summer throughout New York State, New England and elsewhere in the rustic fringes of major metropolises.</p>
        <p>But today Westport has one of the few that has survived, and by reorganizing and physically restoring the building as a year-round institution, it becomes one of a new breed of theaters generated by ex-urbanites who have developed sophisticated communitites in those same rustic fringes.</p>
        <p>The exhibition, mounted by the Westport Historical Society, is flush with the names of more than a thousand legendary stars, revered playwrights, directors and designers. The first leading lady in 1931 was Dorothy Gish. Ethel Barrymore appeared in 1938, Gene Kelly in 1939, Tyrone Power in 1941, Shirley Booth in the premiere of ''Come Back, Little Sheba'' in 1949, when summer stock theaters were a testing ground for new plays headed for Broadway.</p>
        <p>More than 550 productions were presented at the playhouse. Photographs, playbills and other memorabilia on view are testimony to them. Visiting hours are on Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. The theater is off the Post Road East at 25 Powers Court. Call (203) 227-4177 for more information.</p>
        <p>Bicycle Steeplechase</p>
        <p>Steeplechase races on horseback, popular in previous centuries, have been adapted in Northeastern Connecticut to the bicycle. For the past nine years, the Windham Area Interfaith Ministries has sponsored a Steeple Chase Bike Tour rather than a race, winding through some of the state's prettiest countryside.</p>
        <p>On Saturday 20-, 50- and 100-mile routes will be marked, taking cyclists past numerous historic church steeples, where they are invited to make rest stops, just as horseback riders did in the old days. They include the 1754 Hampton Congregational Church, the 1840 United Baptist Church in Westford, and the 1804 church in Lebanon designed by Jonathan Trumbull. Spectators tend to gather at the churches.</p>
        <p>Riders pay a registration fee of $25 for route sheets, guides and a long-sleeved T-shirt. If they wish to qualify for prizes, they must raise $50 in pledges for distribution by social service agencies to needy families in the region. Prizes include weekend getaways in Maine and New Hampshire, health club memberships and gift certificates for bike accessories. For more information or to register, call (850) 450-7122.</p>
        <p>Artful Surprises</p>
        <p>Understanding the contents of some art exhibitions can be challenging to many viewers, and John Sims's installation at the Creative Arts Workshop in New Haven is one of them. He began working on the project, titled ''Constructing the TimeSculpture: A Millenium Installation'' last month and the result will remain on view through Sept. 1.</p>
        <p>After that date the 12 objects that he has created will move to various street-floor windows, community centers and building lobbies in New York City. Subsequently, a total of 23 large sculptures will be placed across the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sims is a mathematician, which probably accounts for the density of his concepts. The project consists of four parts: vases, chess sets, chairs and clocks. Each part is related to the human condition.</p>
        <p>The vases are designed to hold one or many flowers in configurations that resemble racks of test tubes, producing sameness, uniqueness, diversity, and so on. The chess sets are a metaphor for conflict and competition, while the chairs are about family, loyalty and a support system. The clocks follow human growth and maturity, beginning with a fertility clock, moving to a child clock, a self-portrait clock, traffic clock and grandson clock.</p>
        <p>When put together, elements of the parts form a vignette of two chairs facing each other across a table holding a chess board set with vases as chess pieces, overlooked by a clock on a pole centered behind the table, as though timing the moves.</p>
        <p>The workshop is at 80 Audubon Street, and is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information, call (203) 562-4927.</p>
        <p>Tread of Time</p>
        <p>Time is the focus of another exhibition, ''Speed of Vision,'' at the Aldrich Museum in Ridgefield through Sept. 6. Designed by Matthew Yokobosky, an exhibition designer at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, it is composed of videotapes and mixed-media installations divided into zones of slow motion, real time and hyper-speed.</p>
        <p>Eleven works are featured, simulating real-life experiences exploited by editing and filming techniques to manipulate the viewer's concept of time. Emotional and psychological responses generated by the exhibit momentarily alter one's bearings and sense of reality.</p>
        <p>A general environment of overlapping sounds and images includes an exploration of the relationship between man's ambition to travel fast and his desire to record the process. Documentary scenes of space travel are compared with Hollywood film excerpts.</p>
        <p>The work of 12 artists, some of whom are performance artists, are involved in the exhibition. Today, from 4 to 6 p.m., Charles Atlas will perform a dance work in the context of fantasy-cum-reality. Admission will be $10.</p>
        <p>The museum, at 258 Main Street, is open Tuesday through Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. Admission is $5 for adults, $2 for children and older adults, free for children under 12. Visitors attending the dance performance do not pay museum admission. For more information, call (203) 438-4519.</p>
        <p>'Framing the Past'</p>
        <p>''Framing the Past,'' an exhibition at the Connecticut River Museum in Essex through October, is all about building ships, houses and barns. It was organized by Jeffrey L. Bradley, an architectural historian and conservator, as a comprehensive study of how ships, houses and barns were built in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Mr. Bradley will give gallery demonstrations of various construction techniques, linking shipbuilding to home- and barn-building. One such event is scheduled on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. , when he will focus on augurs. Hundreds of augurs in the museum's collection will be on view, and he will provide hands-on demonstrations of their use. He will lead similar programs on Sept. 3 and 16 and Oct. 21.</p>
        <p>The museum, overlooking the Connecticut River at Steamboat Dock, 67 Main Street, is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $4 for adults, $2 for children 6 through 12. Call (860) 767-8269 for more information.</p>
