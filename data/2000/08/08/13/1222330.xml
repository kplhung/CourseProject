        <p>After investing more than $150,000 over two years to stoke the campaign of his good friend Al Gore, Jonathan Tisch may see his political agenda and his business interests collide.</p>
        <p>Employees accuse Mr. Tisch, chief executive of Loews Hotels, of thwarting their attempts to  unionize the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel, headquarters for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the party's national convention. The 300 workers seeking to unionize are taking the opportunity to escalate  protests just as the convention hits town. Five hundred people demonstrated outside the hotel on Thursday; 60 protesters were arrested.</p>
        <p>The Tisches, said Miguel Contreras, executive treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, ''are definitely putting profits over politics.''</p>
        <p>''And we're not going to allow them to wear two masks at the Democratic convention,'' he added. ''They are going to wear one mask, and that's the mask of a union buster.''</p>
        <p>Richard Mintz, a spokesman for Loews Hotels, said that neither the company nor Mr. Tisch was anti-union, adding that 5 of the 15 Loews hotels were already unionized. ''This is not about stopping a union,'' Mr. Mintz said.  ''This is about having a process to decide whether the employees want to have a union.''</p>
        <p>The campaign committee, however, has moved its credential issuing to another hotel. Though House members will remain at the Loews, the committee has asked them to support the workers by wearing pins, signing a letter to management and joining a rally today. Jesse Jackson, Ted Kennedy and Dick Gephardt planned to attend.</p>
