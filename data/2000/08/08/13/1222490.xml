        <p>ZUCKERBERG-Lillian Chestney. Passed away on August 6, 2000. Born on September 22, 1913, Lillian studied art on scholarship at Pratt Institute in the 1930s and later at the Art Students League in New York City. It was at Pratt that she met and later married Stanley Maxwell Zuckerberg on June 22, 1941. Separated briefly during World War II, when Stanley was part of the 58th Bombardment Wing of the XXI Bomber Command, they were soul mates in art and life. They both worked as illustrators in the 1940s and 1950s. Their illustrations can be found on the covers of the classic paperback romance novels of that time and inside the pages of popular magazines such as ''Saturday Evening Post'', ''Colliers'', and ''McCalls''. Lillian's highly skilled, realistic, and fanciful paintings also decorated the pages of children's books, commercial advertising supplements, and cook books. Lillian specialized in illustrating children's books. One of her works was selected for the Classic Comics edition of ''Gulliver's Travels.'' Later in life she and Stanley turned to subject matter which resonated with their early lifepainting harbor and waterfront scenes from their travels through New England and Nova Scotia. She will be remembered with respect, admiration, and fondness by her nephew Dr. Richard M. Zuckerberg, and his wife Dr. Joan Zuckerberg, nieces Anya Zuckerberg, Betty Zuckerberg, and Judith H. Zuckerberg, and sister-in-law Sophie Zuckerberg.</p>
