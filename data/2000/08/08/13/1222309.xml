        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Online Teaching: The Battle in Cyberspace'' (Education Life section, Aug. 6) did not touch on the central issue: Is Internet teaching any better than traditional instruction?</p>
        <p>What is needed is a comparison  of outcomes; how well do students learn by these two methods?</p>
        <p>Such questions must be answered discipline by discipline.</p>
        <p>For the last two years, in my college-level courses, I have introduced the Internet as a component. Each class had an electronic bulletin board for questions and answers and for discussion of course-related issues.</p>
        <p>This approach seemed to be productive.</p>
        <p>But I still have reservations about eliminating direct human interaction, at least from science or mathematics courses.</p>
        <p>As far as I know, the superiority of electronic education has not yet been demonstrated.</p>
        <p>Online teaching is certainly better than nothing, but it is not ideal.</p>

        <p>The writer is a professor in the department of mathematical sciences at Montclair State University.</p>
