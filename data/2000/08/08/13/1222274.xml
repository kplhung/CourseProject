        <p>Preservationists sighed with relief a week ago when the president of Silvercup Studios, which produces the television shows ''Sex in the City'' and ''The Sopranos,'' announced his purchase of a little building made of terra cotta and his intention to restore it.</p>
        <p>The dilapidated red office building, and the terra cotta factory that used to be attached to it, produced the exterior decorations that grace some of the city's most treasured buildings. Carnegie Hall bears decorative terra cotta baked and created at the site, for example, and so does the Plaza Hotel.</p>
        <p>''People want to come see it all the time, and it's been unbelievably embarrassing to show them,'' said Susan Tunick, president of Friends of Terra Cotta, a preservationist group. The building, at 42-10 Vernon Boulevard, was landmarked in 1982.</p>
        <p>Since the 1960's, the building and the three-acre lot attached to it have belonged to Citibank, now Citigroup.  The factory was torn down by the bank in 1976.</p>
        <p>What remains is the ornate two-story office building, which the owners of the New York Terra Cotta Architectural Company created in 1892 as a showpiece for terra cotta. The company, founded in 1886, was the city's first, and for years its only, maker of the material. As use of terra cotta blossomed soon after its founding, the company prospered.</p>
        <p>The office building, designed by Francis Kimball, contains terra cotta ornamentation around the windows and the outside walls, as well as three terra cotta fireplaces. One, which Ms. Tunick calls ''an absolute treasure,'' is signed by James Taylor, a company supervisor who spent much of his life popularizing terra cotta in the city.</p>
        <p>But the building has suffered since the factory closed in the late 1930's.  Someone raised dogs at the site for a time and a stereo store once operated from it. Since the 1960's, when Citibank took over the property as part of a foreclosure, it has suffered from leaks, floods and a petroleum spill from an adjacent site.</p>
        <p>But Stuart Match Suna, the Silvercup president, announced on Aug. 4 that he had created a new venture called Terra Cotta L.L.C. and that a year ago it had bought the building and factory site from Citigroup.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suna, whose wife, Vicki Match Suna, serves on the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, said he had kept the deal quiet until he had formed a plan. Now, he said, he has decided he will restore the building, but added, ''We don't exactly know what its use will be.''</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Suna nor the bank would reveal the price.</p>
        <p>''It's very good news,'' Terri Thomson, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said about the sale to Mr. Suna. ''We weren't just going to sell it to anybody.''</p>
