        <p>Not so long ago, the streets around the Edgecombe Deli were emptier and more menacing.</p>
        <p>At night, one bodega worker felt safest when wearing a bullet-proof vest. His former boss, Henry A. Medina, had not worn one. He was shot in the heart while opening the cash register for two men in ski masks, who were never caught.</p>
        <p>That was in November 1992. The previous year, 50 workers in small stores were killed in robberies throughout the city. (This year, the police said, no such figures were collected.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Medina's son, Ervin, who manages the small store at 139th Street and Edgecombe Avenue in West Harlem, said the neighborhood is much safer now, in part thanks to an increased police presence.</p>
        <p>''It's calmed down, its not the same as it was before,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Medina, who has worked at the store for 10 years, was on the daytime shift when his father was killed. ''It wasn't that long ago,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But it's more peaceful now, he said.  ''There are a lot more families moving in,'' he said. ''People are feeling safer.''</p>
        <p>Some other grocery stores and restaurants have opened up nearby, he said, but he is not concerned about the competition. And the staff has stayed pretty much the same.</p>
        <p>''We're keeping safe,'' he said, ''but seeing that nothing's happened, like I said, there are more police activities going on, and everybody feels much better now.''</p>
