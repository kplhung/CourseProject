        <p>We asked online readers of Lisa Belkin's article whether our culture dotes on children too much. Here are some responses from , a New York Times Web site (www.abuzz.com).</p>
        <p>I thought Belkin's article unnecessarily turned the kids-no-kids argument into one where if you don't have children, you automatically hate them. Such actions draw battle lines that would not exist in a more conciliatory society. In the article, the portrait of the average childless individual was some sort of bohemian dot-com worker who can't be bothered.</p>
        <p>(Patlichty)</p>
        <p>There is no backlash against children. There is a backlash against obnoxious parents who demand special treatment because of their children and feel threatened by those adults who haven't chosen to have kids.</p>
        <p>(Lissa NYC)</p>
        <p>Yes, our culture does dote on children too much, but at the same time neglects them in certain important ways. Isn't it strange that there is more and more news about children committing crimes, including murder! Nobody's listening to them, even as parents may spoil them.</p>
        <p>(Mimigee)</p>
        <p>I must take issue with the people who think having children is some kind of public service. Do you mean to say that your kids will provide services to me in my old age for free? If your kids grow up to become productive citizens, I will pay them for any good they do me. And as far as the Social Security argument goes, no, I'm not breeding little cogs to be part of the great wheel of Social Security. On the other hand, I'm not producing future recipients of Social Security either. Your grandkids will be thanking me.</p>
        <p>(JLB)</p>
        <p>As for employers ''doting'' on families with children, do you know why they do this? Single people with no dependents, although able to work ridiculous hours and make their jobs foremost in their lives, are also the first ones who will abandon the company when something better comes along. I, on the other hand, will stick around longer because I have to worry about selling my house and uprooting my family.</p>
