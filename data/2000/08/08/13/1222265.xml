        <p>THE red diamond is worth half a million. It's just half a carat and looks like a piece of faceted beach glass. ''It's minuscule,'' Catherine Deneuve says. ''I blow, and it's gone.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Deneuve is paying a call on Yves Ringler, a diamond merchant who often sells stones to her friend the Argentine jeweler Marcial Berro. Mr. Ringler's firm, the Cora Diamond Corporation, is well known in the trade for dealing in colored gems of exceptional rarity and, of course, cost.</p>
        <p>Gems are a subject for which Ms. Deneuve has what you might understate as an affinity. It's an interest put to good use in ''Place Vendome,'' opening here this week. The film stars Ms. Deneuve as the alcoholic widow of a prestigious Parisian diamond dealer driven to suicide by debt. The plot, such as it is, revolves around her discovery of, and attempts to unload, a cache of precious and undoubtedly stolen diamonds. ''I like very much stones,'' the actress says. ''I've always collected them, rocks at first and then heart-shaped stones and then precious stones and then . . . ''</p>
        <p>''Let me show you something rather special,'' Mr. Ringler says.</p>
        <p>It is a simmering midweek afternoon, but the atmosphere in Mr. Ringler's Midtown office is cool and hushed. The Cora Diamond Corporation is on a street called Diamond and Jewelry Way, in a nondescript building with an OshKosh B'Gosh store on the ground floor and the elite Diamond Dealers Club above. It is here on 47th Street that an extraordinary percentage of all the gem diamonds on the world market are faceted, bought and sold; that lobby clocks are set to times in the diamond capitals of the world (New York, London, Antwerp); that merchants bustle around carrying million-dollar gems in cloth wallets beneath their trousers; that security is so tight that even Catherine Deneuve is stopped for an ID.</p>
        <p>Can that be? The star of ''Belle de Jour''? The favorite not only of Bunuel but Truffaut, Aldrich, Polanski, and Agnes Varda? The onetime face of Marianne, emblem of France? It seems strange to say so, but casually dressed in a black linen shift, an orange cashmere cardigan, beige fishnet stockings and tiger-printed linen sling-backs with pointy toes, Ms. Deneuve might pass along New York's streets almost unrecognized.</p>
        <p>Her hair is tawny. She wears sunglasses with strong prescription lenses. Her eyes are slightly puffy, but otherwise she appears to be a typical Parisian woman of indefinite age, the type once referred to as B.C.B.G. (bon chic, bon genre) by the French. Some biographies put Ms. Deneuve in her mid-50's; some say she's a decade older. Whatever the truth, she retains the slightly frigid demeanor that earned her the nickname ''ice queen,'' a description she used to detest but now says she thinks is ''right on.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Deneuve has a brother-in-law, a niece and two nephews in the gem trade. She is a collector of jewels. She can diagram a diamond -- table, girdle and culet -- and talk not only with expertise, but with experience, about the great jewelers like Harry Winston, Chaumet and JAR; about the diamond bourse in Antwerp; about the ancient universal method for carrying loose gems, which is to fold them into a paper pouch.</p>
        <p>''I had to learn this folding,'' she says, for ''Place Vendome.'' ''You couldn't fake it. And once you fold the paper, there is no way the stone can go out of the envelope.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ringler places a tray on the table. ''Most diamond dealers trade in half carats,'' he remarks. ''One carat and up, it's considered large diamonds.'' He brings out an intense blue diamond that, by anyone's standards, is large: 22 carats. ''I like very much this blue,'' Ms. Deneuve says. ''But really, you are going to sell that to . . . who? To an Arab? And she can only go out with two bodyguards?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ringler palms the stone and then replaces it with a rose one the size of a pigeon's egg. ''Pretty,'' Ms. Deneuve says coolly. ''And how do you call this color?''</p>
        <p>''Bazooka pink,'' he says. ''The rough was African and was over 30-something carats to start.''</p>
        <p>At Cannes last year, Ms. Deneuve explains, she wore a necklace from Harry Winston. It had three very large diamonds and was copied from an original belonging to Marilyn Monroe. ''But hers,'' she says, ''was fake.'' Harry Winston was famous in the trade for two things, Mr. Ringler remarks: he never allowed his face to appear in pictures, and he always carried a rock in his pocket. ''He liked to have the feel of a diamond around him,'' he says.</p>
        <p>''I understand,'' Ms. Deneuve says.</p>
        <p>Yet, with her own gems Ms. Deneuve is casual to the point of seeming heedless. Once, she explains, she cleaned a diamond ring in a pot of boiling water and forgot it was on the stove. The ring was a loss, but the gem survived. She once dropped a stone in the dirt while gardening with her grandson. She continues: ''For me . . . what can you do? It was a little diamond. These things happen. But for him it was wonderful, like a fairy tale, digging, looking for this treasure in the earth.''</p>
        <p>The actress lifts an enormous blue stone, and then a yellow and then a pink, the aggregate value of the three probably $20 million or more. She examines each as casually as though it were a lump of sugar and then replaces it with ostentatious care.</p>
        <p>''My tastes,'' she says, ''don't go to such large pieces. It's disturbing. It's distracting.'' When a woman wears a piece of jewelry like that, she adds, cocking her beautiful face slightly, to calculated effect, ''you don't see the woman.'' There is a pause. A certain kind of answer is obviously called for. ''Another woman, perhaps,'' Mr. Ringler replies. And Catherine Deneuve permits herself a faint smile.</p>
