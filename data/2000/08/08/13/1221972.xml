        <p>BETWEEN them, the war and the wall have dominated European history in the century now ending. And one of the things that the Berlin Wall itself ensured, both as an emblem and as a physical fact, was the lack of any meaningful accounting for World War II in the short-lived country that was called the German Democratic Republic. What, after all, did East Germany have to account for? As Communists, its inhabitants were -- at least officially -- the opponents and victims of fascism. So the country declared itself innocent on both the large question of the Holocaust and the smaller though more tractable issue of the property German Jews had lost during the Nazi period. Most such properties simply fell into the hands of a state that by definition exempted itself from even such limited restitution as West Germany tried to make.</p>
        <p>One of the stories this situation produced has already been told in ''The House at the Bridge'' (1995), by Katie Hafner, a skillfully written account of one family's attempt to reclaim its expropriated Potsdam mansion, the wrinkle being that in East Germany the house had become a much-needed day care center. Now the German novelist Peter Schneider has produced his own tartly flavored version. ''Eduard's Homecoming'' picks up on the characters Schneider introduced in ''Couplings,'' his 1996 novel about sex and (mostly) West Berlin in the days when the wall still held; but though some details may remain cryptic, this new book can easily be read on its own. In the space between the two novels, Eduard Hoffmann has left Berlin for an American wife and a job at Stanford. Two things bring this rather colorless biologist back to ''the gray capital of a gray ex-country.'' The first is a job at a research institute in what was East Berlin, and the second is the unexpected news that he has inherited an apartment building there, a bequest from a grandfather he never met.</p>
        <p>But taking up his inheritance will prove complicated. The building lies in Friedrichshain, a working-class district that today has a kind of downtown edge for those who find the nearer reaches of the former East too gentrified; too schickimicki, as the saying goes. Eduard's building doesn't precisely have tenants, but it isn't empty either. It's a squatter's haven, and when he first visits, the residents bombard the ''landlord from the West'' with flares and bar him from entry. The police are unhelpful, and eviction is nearly impossible; nevertheless, as Eduard soon learns, he remains liable for the utilities. What's more, the building may not even be his, for it seems his grandfather bought it from a Jewish friend in 1933. In a city where ''history was being rewritten as the history of family property,'' Eduard must now learn if the building was ''honestly'' acquired or ''a forced sale arising from persecution.'' Is he really the heir of a Nazi profiteer, as the squatters claim, and if so, what should he do about it?</p>
        <p>Schneider is perhaps best known here for ''The German Comedy,'' a 1991 book of essays that explored not only the end of the wall but such topics as the Vietnamese presence in East Berlin and Germans' relations with their dogs. And the sardonic reportorial eye that those essays displayed is one of this novel's most attractive features. Schneider defines the role of designer kitchens in the Westernization of the East and explains the special difficulty of building skyscrapers in Berlin's reborn Potsdamer Platz, where the water table is so high that the foundations must be laid by scuba divers. He's especially authoritative on the continued divisions between the city's two halves, with the ''Ossis'' resenting the ''Wessis'' for taking all the best jobs, while a bar owner in the West waits through some slow years for her customers to return from that exotic land beyond the Brandenburg Gate. And Schneider does an especially fine job in working out the apartment building's human history. In a recent article for The New York Times Magazine, he explored the ''good deeds'' of a number of ''ordinary Germans'' in saving Jews. Here he sharpens the point, emphasizing not the simple existence of such Germans but the fact that their willingness to take risks makes those who didn't look worse.</p>
        <p>Only one aspect of the reporting that makes up the factual background in ''Eduard's Homecoming'' troubled me. Any visitor to Berlin, and still more any resident, is now acutely conscious of living in history; one knows that each month, each year, isn't like the one that came before or the one that comes next. So much change, so many construction sites -- impermanence is now itself the city's permanent condition. Schneider has chosen to set the novel at some indeterminate post-wall point. My own estimate would be in the mid-90's, but Schneider never specifies a date and indeed seems to have taken details from different times. Would more precision have made the book as disposable as journalism is invidiously held to be? I don't think so. Rather, it would have increased the sense of contemporaneity that is very much the strongest thing about it.</p>
        <p>ONE would also like to know just how old Schneider's protagonist is; he hardly seems to have had the time to produce two adolescent daughters in the years between ''Couplings'' and ''Eduard's Homecoming.'' That's especially important because Schneider doesn't limit himself to Eduard's attempts to claim his inheritance. More of the novel deals with his marital difficulties, with the different values that he and his wife place upon a sexual glitch. Do Eduard's anxieties suggest that he's never quite grown up, or do they mark the claw of incipient age? Yet while Schneider writes a lot about lubricity, he doesn't write about it especially well, and Eduard's sexual concerns seem far more formulaic, and far less suggestive, than do his property problems. Though perhaps that simply confirms what Schneider suggests in writing that ''most people possessed two private lives, of which their proprietorial life was the more private,'' the one they're less willing to share with strangers.</p>
        <p>John Brownjohn's translation has flattened out the deadpan edge of Schneider's German, giving the novel a less strongly voiced, less original style. However, it reads smoothly, its narrative marked by a practiced and fluent ease. Schneider will, I suspect, remain best known not as a novelist but as one of contemporary Germany's shrewdest cultural commentators. Yet anyone interested in Berlin today will not only recognize the world he describes in ''Eduard's Homecoming,'' but will also learn from it.</p>
