        <p>In many parts of the country, a proposal for a super-duper tourist-attracting mega-mall would be greeted with howls of protest, followed by reams of lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Not in Syracuse, where many citizens are embracing the mall plan as a way to revive their struggling city. Their praise, however, is less enthusiastic than resigned; a popular sign at a public hearing last month was, ''Do You Have a Better Alternative?''</p>
        <p>The mall could well become the largest shopping center in the country (excluding the island of Manhattan). Its developers, the Pyramid Management Group, plan to triple the size of their existing mall, the Carousel Center, and turn it into a 103-acre shopping and entertainment extravaganza, with hotels, restaurants and even an aquarium.</p>
        <p>The current 1.6 million-square-foot mall would be expanded to 4.5 million square feet; the leader in the enormous mall sweepstakes, the Mall of America outside Minneapolis, is 4.2 million square feet, although there are plans to expand it, too.</p>
        <p>But metropolitan Minneapolis is four times the size of Syracuse, which has a population of only 735,000. Minneapolis is also far more prosperous. The average household income around the Mall of America is about $66,000, versus about $47,000 for households near the Carousel Center, according to data from the International Council of Shopping Centers.</p>
        <p>Dozens of new malls, full of movie theaters, skating rinks and other attractions, are in the works across the country, the council reports. None of them are as big as the one proposed for Syracuse, and almost all of them are being built in booming areas. But Syracuse has only recently emerged from a decade-long recession during which it lost residents.</p>
        <p>Even the mall's supporters concede that Syracuse seems an unlikely place for a mammoth mall. ''Intuition tells you this isn't going to be that great,'' said Vito Sciscioli, the commissioner of economic development for the city, from which the developers are seeking tax breaks for the $900 million project. But, he said, consultants hired by the city to evaluate the plan told him, ''You've got a hot one here.''</p>
        <p>The reason? Tourists. The mall's backers think that millions of tourists will go to the expanded mall, bringing lots of cash into Syracuse (more than $1 billion, by one estimate). Luring them, the developers say, will be stores with outdoor themes, catering to hunters, campers and anglers. After all, L. L. Bean draws hordes to Freeport, Me., and the Bass Pro Shop is ''the largest tourist attraction in the state of Missouri,'' said Bruce A. Kenan, a partner at Pyramid.</p>
        <p>Tourists do seem to visit giant malls, especially those that bill themselves as theme parks. Opry Mills, which opened in Nashville in May and attracted 100,000 people on its first day, says about 30 percent of its visitors are not from Tennessee. Foreign tourists account for more than 5 percent of the 42.5 million people who visit the Mall of America (which has an amusement park) each year.</p>
        <p>Developers must court travel agents and tour operators and travel writers, however. They spend a lot to attract people, said Therese Byrne, who writes the newsletter Retail Maxim. ''Is Pyramid set up to do that?'' she asked. She added that she was a little dubious of the hunting and fishing theme, noting that 80 percent of shoppers are women.</p>
        <p>But while many tourists shop when they travel, how many travel just to shop remains unclear. Most successful tourist malls are in places tourists already visit, like Florida, Southern California and next to the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.</p>
        <p>Though it is hardly a tourist mecca, Syracuse does draw hundreds of thousands of people every year for the State Fair, and crowds attend sporting events at the Syracuse University. The city is at the junction of the state Thruway and Interstate 81.</p>
        <p>''There's huge snowbird traffic, and they need destinations along the way,'' said Peggy R. Bendel, a senior vice president at Development Counsellors International.</p>
        <p>The developers concede that were they not based in Syracuse, they would not be pursuing the project. ''If you didn't have the emotional attachment, you wouldn't do it,'' Mr. Kenan said.</p>
        <p>That sentiment may help Pyramid calm fears expressed at a public hearing and in letters to the Syracuse newspapers that the mall expansion will be a windfall for Robert J. Congel, Pyramid's founder. It may prove less reassuring to the financial institutions backing the project, especially now that interest rates have gone up and enthusiasm for mall deals has cooled.</p>
        <p>The developers said they would expand the mall in two stages, with construction beginning next spring. They say the current mall draws 17 million visitors a year and is bursting at the seams. ''We're 98-point-something leased,'' said Stephen J. Congel, whose father, Robert, is in charge of leasing space in the expanded mall.</p>
        <p>Pyramid built the Palisades Center in West Nyack, N.Y., which was the target of community protests and lawsuits for more than a decade. The company said the shopping mall was doing extremely well. But not all of the developers' projects have panned out: a shopping center in Providence, R.I., that Pyramid started work on in 1983 changed hands in 1996 and finally opened last year.</p>
        <p>And some of the partners in other Pyramid projects recently sued the company and Robert J. Congel, saying he siphoned money from some of his other malls to support the ones in Syracuse and West Nyack and to pay some of his own bills. He and Pyramid have denied the charges in court filings.</p>
        <p>Pyramid has had some financial problems, in part because the Carousel Center turned out to be far more expensive to build than expected.</p>
        <p>The mall sits on the site of an old junkyard. The land is so marshy that the mall does not sit on pilings but floats on the soupy ground; water is pumped in or out to keep it stable. The expanded mall would cover more of Oil City, which was polluted by oil tanks, north of the city near the Onondaga Lake and Canal. One reason Syracuse officials are supporting the mall is that the land will probably not find any other takers, unless the government cleans it up, said Mr. Sciscoli, the city commissioner.</p>
        <p>Pyramid, which pays almost no real estate taxes now, has asked Syracuse to defer levying any such taxes for 30 years. The developer would then make payments in lieu of taxes to pay off tax-exempt bonds, which would finance road improvements and parking garages. Mayor Roy Bernardi and the developers have agreed on the deal, which is under consideration by city and county legislators.</p>
        <p>Some in Syracuse have suggested that the city would do better to grab real estate taxes on the current mall, rather than give them up for three decades to help finance a bigger mall.</p>
        <p>Minchin G. Lewis, the city auditor, said the city would get relatively little money from the mall's property taxes, but could get a lot more if the expanded mall succeeded. ''The city's being asked to give the developer a baseball bat and hope it hits a home run,'' he said. ''If it strikes out, we don't lose anything.''</p>
