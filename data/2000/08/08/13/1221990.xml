        <p>Long Odds</p>
        <p>Stories.</p>
        <p>By Gordon Weaver.</p>
        <p>University of Missouri , paper, $17.95.</p>
        <p>The benighted protagonists of Gordon Weaver's ninth collection of stories are all struggling against entropy, trying to maintain balance as their internal and external worlds go skittering out of control. These underemployed, undermotivated and often straight-out con men share a quest for meaning that is often revealed in their oddly empathic natures. The book's first story, ''Mannequin,'' is about a man named Zog Hocha, a talented mime who is given a job drumming up business for Stanley Zucker, proprietor of Fashions by Mr. Stan. Zog catches the eyes of passers-by, causing them to stop at Stan's shop when they recognize their own gestures, expressions and deepest feelings mirrored back in his face and body. It's a selling technique that at first works wonderfully and then goes deeply awry. Weaver's comic ironies can occasionally seem repetitive, and he tends to recycle particularly catchy phrases. But these are small faults. Weaver assembles a vivid cast of characters and his stories are freshly imagined. In his final piece, ''Imagining the Structure of Free Space on Pioneer Road,'' he dispenses with twisted ironies as he tells the tale of a father desperately trying to experience his 7-year-old blind daughter's world. This unnamed protagonist discovers that her blindness, the very circumstance that brought chaos into his family's life, also binds them together.</p>
