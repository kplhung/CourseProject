        <p>THE paintings of one of Westchester County's most important 20th-century artists are currently on display at the Hudson River Museum in an exhibition titled ''Fun City: Celebrating the Life of Ralph Fasanella.'' Characterized by muddy pinks, cold grays, lime greens and robust blues, Mr. Fasanella's art memorializes the plight of the underclasses.

        <p>Mr. Fasanella (1914-97) did not begin painting until he was 30, though he had already lived a lifetime of experiences. From his first job delivering ice with his father to his time spent at the New York Catholic Protectory on Tremont Avenue in the Bronx, where extreme measures were often taken in disciplining the young Fasanella, he experienced a life that would eventually evolve into powerful paintings. After dropping out of school, he held a number of jobs -- gas station attendant, machinist, and later, labor organizer -- learning firsthand that the working class deserved better work and living conditions.</p>

        <p>THE paintings of one of Westchester County's most important 20th-century artists are currently on display at the Hudson River Museum in an exhibition titled ''Fun City: Celebrating the Life of Ralph Fasanella.'' Characterized by muddy pinks, cold grays, lime greens and robust blues, Mr. Fasanella's art memorializes the plight of the underclasses. He depicts the common Jane or Joe -- how they lived, what they experienced and what made them remember who they were and where they came from is the message in his paintings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fasanella (1914-97) did not begin painting until he was 30, though he had already lived a lifetime of experiences. From his first job delivering ice with his father to his time spent at the New York Catholic Protectory on Tremont Avenue in the Bronx, where extreme measures were often taken in disciplining the young Fasanella, he experienced a life that would eventually evolve into powerful paintings. After dropping out of school, he held a number of jobs -- gas station attendant, machinist, and later, labor organizer -- learning firsthand that the working class deserved better work and living conditions.</p>
        <p>He saw early on the missing equality, and he disdained the abuses of government as well as commercial enterprises. Most important, he was able, with uncommon design and color, to tell stories in his paintings that would make us all feel, imagine and understand the commitment and determination of  immigrants. He was a messenger, a chronicler of his time. Whether it was an important event or a quiet moment, he captured it his way in paint that was thick and rough with detail.</p>
        <p>He may have been at his best when he focused on the every day, when there was no particular person or event to immortalize. In ''Grand Union'' (1955), he makes a common day perfect. Melting slushy snow became sinuous lines: satisfied shoppers fill their carts and car trunks with food, while a billowing hillside gently nudges a happy home. It all works because he lets his observations lead the way. He combined conflicting perspectives because it made his compositions more compelling. He plays with distance as it relates to scale because it focuses our attention on what he deems important, and he adds little things like children skating on a frozen pond or a child taking a moment before he sleds his way back down the hill he just climbed because he wants us to remember.</p>
        <p>Looking at his work, it is easy to see that despite the abundance of buildings, he was most interested in people. He painted buildings so he could look inside them, placing people here and there or to capture a living area.</p>
        <p>He consulted with passers-by about his work; especially when he sketched in one of his favorite haunts, Nathan's on Central Avenue in Yonkers, where a constant and open dialogue with his subjects could be maintained.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fasanella is best known for his historic, social commentary, when he focused his attention on injustices and oppression. ''Lawrence 1912 -- Meeting at the Common'' (1977) is one of a series of 18 works depicting the 1912 strike in Lawrence, Mass. He spent three years in Lawrence, gathering information that he would later use for this series.</p>
        <p>In ''Meeting at the Common,'' striking workers and their families carrying signs that read ''Food for Kids'' or ''No Cut in Pay'' are shown as they line the streets. Above it all, from the top floor of a nearby building, the upper management of the company looks down, watching every move as security forces approach. Along the tops of the buildings, chimneys spew bursts of color not unlike fireworks, while the sky shimmers in red, white, blue and gold. Throughout the upper half of the composition, Mr. Fasanella paints circles: clock faces, round windows and the setting sun, which comprises his most formal work in the show.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fasanella loved baseball, and many of the works in the show have at least a minor reference to the game. The first thing that one might notice when viewing ''Night Game -- 'Tis a Bunt'' (1981) is that both the pitcher and the hitter are much larger than the other players. Mr. Fasanella painted them that way because they were the two most important players at that moment. The painting also shows his knowledge of the game because the third baseman is halfway down the third base line while the short stop is covering third base.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the pitcher, who appears to be trying to block second base with his right leg, looks as if he is trying to roll or hand the ball directly to the catcher, which is impossible physically, although it is what he wishes he could do.</p>
        <p>One painting, ''Gas Station Playground'' (1983), best sums up Mr. Fasanella's overall approach to capturing the world around him. Despite the obvious chaos and decay that dots this painting's setting, he manages to add just enough fun to make it all seem livable, even enjoyable. Children play on fallen gas pumps, others down the station's light posts while a pair of youths watches  from atop an abandoned mattress. The oversize muffler sign that stood on the roof of Happy and Bud's Garage hangs by what one would imagine to be a final rusty bolt or nail, though no one beneath it seems to care. One more detail, a cat, which appears happy just to watch it all from the roof of an adjacent building, also seems to be watching us as if to see if a passing museum visitor might want to join in the fun.</p>
        <p>''Fun City: Celebrating the Life of Ralph Fasanella'' ends Sept. 10. The information number is (914) 963-4550.</p>
