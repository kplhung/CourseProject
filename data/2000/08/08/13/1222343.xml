        <p>The possible death of the death tax, to borrow from Mark Twain, has been greatly exaggerated.</p>
        <p>Even though ''repeal'' of the levy, known in less partisan terms as the estate tax, has been passed by both houses of Congress, Republican leaders have yet to send the bill to President Clinton, who vows a veto.</p>
        <p>Instead, Republican leaders appear to have decided that there are more votes in attacking Democrats for preserving the so-called marriage tax -- the president recently vetoed a remedy of it -- than in seeking tax relief for the wealthy.</p>
        <p>But even if the Republican bill -- or a less ambitious Democratic alternative -- became law, it would not mean that the government would stop taxing estates, at least not anytime soon. For one thing, the levy would phase out over a decade, not disappearing until 2010. At that point, to minimize revenue loss, the Treasury would start collecting tax on a buildup of capital gains that it now disregards -- the amount by which a stock, for example, has appreciated before an heir receives it.</p>
        <p>Currently, estates bigger than $675,000 are hit with taxes progressing from 37 percent to 55 percent; the threshold is to rise to $1 million in 2006.</p>
        <p>With so much uncertainty over the tax,  planners are giving general advice to remain financially flexible. They also remind clients that they may need more, not less, professional counseling.</p>
        <p>''Don't be frozen into thinking that, 'Oh boy! This might go away,' '' David Megaw, second vice president at Lincoln Financial Advisors in Hartford, said of the tax issues. ''You'll probably be disappointed.''</p>
