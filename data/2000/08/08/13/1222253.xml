        <p>THE wooden Venetian blinds, well-chosen collection of photography, nice Oriental rugs. Shocking! Could this tasteful Greenwich Village apartment possibly belong to John Waters? This is, after all, the writer-director of ''Mondo Trasho,'' the godfather of sicko cinema, who created scratch-and-sniff cards for ''Polyester'' -- a movie he filmed in something called odorama.</p>
        <p>On his way out to the New York premiere of his new movie, ''Cecil B. Demented,'' on Wednesday night, Mr. Waters pointed to the pink toilet-paper dispenser in the living room as the only concession to the bad taste at the core of his cinematic art.</p>
        <p>''It's chiffon,'' he said proudly.</p>
        <p>Natty as ever, he wore a pre-wrinkled white shirt top-buttoned under a loose sport coat with white pants and white shoes offset by crazily striped socks. The pencil moustache is going gray, but Mr. Waters, 54, isn't.</p>
        <p>Pat Moran -- his casting director, producer and Baltimore friend -- was going with him to the premiere. But before they could get in the limo, she had to do her Polaroid. Everyone gets snapped for the archive. Not just once, but every time the person comes into the apartment.</p>
        <p>Paper magazine, the downtown monthly, sponsored the premiere, at the Village East. Mr. Waters worked the rope line like a pro, recycling sound bites. ''Always put sex and violence in your first movie,'' he advised a young indie aspirant.</p>
        <p>The guest list was a crush of chic scenesters, aging demimonde and gender confusion. There was Bob, a tall busty blonde in a bikini who looked like a rather pretty drag queen but turned out to be a woman who dresses like a drag queen. And Harriet Dodge, a puckish actress with a small and quite real goatee. Veruschka, the 60's model and muse, came, too. ''Veruschka!'' Mr. Waters said after greeting her, ''Now that's a celebrity.''</p>
        <p>Kim Hastreiter, an editor and publisher of Paper, made her presence known. ''My first premiere was in Baltimore for 'Polyester,' '' she said ''And I was on acid.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Waters flashed his used-car-salesman grin. ''That was probably when I stopped taking acid.''</p>
        <p>Stephen Dorff, who plays the young guerrilla-cinema visionary, Cecil B., set the rope line gushing. The ''Baltimore contingent,'' as Mr. Waters called them, were also on hand -- respectable-looking folks who had performed unspeakable acts in early Waters movies like ''Pink Flamingos''and ''Desperate Living.'' Those were the days, before ''Hairspray'' and ''Crybaby'' made Mr. Waters safe for the multiplex.</p>
        <p>Before the movie, he said a few words of thanks to the audience. After 90 minutes of bizarre, violent and frequently very funny Hollywood satire in which Melanie Griffith and a band of lunatic filmmakers try to bring down the studio system, Mr. Waters shook a few hands, then hurried down to the limo again.</p>
        <p>''That's the 15th time I've done that,'' he said in the car on the way to Lotus, the club hosting the post-premiere party. ''The first was in a beatnik coffee shop.''</p>
        <p>The D.J. at Lotus played Devo's ''Satisfaction'' while Mr. Waters huddled in a booth that seated, among others, Patricia Hearst, who has a part in the movie, Mr. Dorff, Jack Dafoe (son of Willem) and Fran Lebowitz, who said she gave Mr. Waters his first good review. ''The sickest movie ever made and one of the funniest,'' she wrote of ''Pink Flamingos,'' in 1972.</p>
        <p>By 12:30, Verushka was in the D.J. booth, David Bowie's ''Fame'' was blaring, and it was bedtime for Mr. Waters. An appearance on ''Good Morning America'' loomed. So he went home, the least demented guy in the room.</p>
