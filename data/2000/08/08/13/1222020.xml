        <p>'Paulette used to go to Bergdorf's, but now she goes to meetings of the cauliflower association,'' says Eberhard Mller, the executive chef and part owner of Lut ce, the formidable Manhattan restaurant, as he holds forth in the kitchen of the nouvelle farmhouse he and his wife, Paulette Satur, built two years ago on 20 green acres on the North Fork of Long Island.</p>
        <p>Hands dancing on food like some kind of culinary Nureyev, Mller prepares lunch: cubed tuna tartar (with fresh herbs from the farm) for starters, followed by grilled bass, corn stew and tomatoes. Before the Mllers married on Christmas Day 1996, Mller asked Satur, whom he met one evening when she was dining at Lut ce, ''What do you want to do when you grow up?'' Although Satur made her living as an account representative for a Long Island wine importer, she grew up on a dairy farm in central Pennsylvania and has a master's degree in plant physiology from University of Arizona. So, of course, she answered that she would love to own a farm and grow produce. ''It made perfectly good sense to me,'' Mller says. ''Lut ce needed fresh produce.''</p>
        <p>The couple found the farm the day after they became engaged in the fall of 1996. More than 18 acres are now planted with organic fruit, spices, assorted vegetables, lettuce and some 35 varieties of tomatoes. Not only does Satur Farms provide fresh produce for Lut ce, it also supplies Le Cirque 2000, Fressen and some 50 other restaurants in Manhattan and on the East End of Long Island. All in all, the Mllers ship 3,000 pounds of organic lettuce a week to restaurants and stores in New York. ''New York City,'' Mller reports, ''consumes 30,000 pounds of lettuce every day.''</p>
        <p>Muller takes a Samurai-size stainless-steel knife to the tuna on the chopping block. He dices without looking down. ''The entire experience of growing my own produce has dramatically changed my style of cooking at home, and at Lut ce,'' he says. ''I used to think I was using fresh ingredients, but I wasn't. Lut ce has become incredibly more seasonal. Just because it is the first day of spring, we do not change the menu and have spring pea soup. Farmers plant their peas by St. Patrick's Day. Ever see peas grow in three days? Now I wait until I have local spring peas to make pea soup. I go out in the farm and see what's ripe. Then I decide what I'm cooking.''</p>
        <p>This year, when the strawberries were first in bloom, Mller went looking for the ''perfect berry'' in fields hidden from view from the house by tall rye grass. He walked for over an hour, ''one of the most delightful things I've ever done,'' he says, although his wife couldn't find him and, ''Green Acres'' 2000 style, tracked him down on his cell phone.</p>
        <p>''Where are you, darling?''</p>
        <p>''In the strawberry fields, dear.''</p>
        <p>Paulette Satur returns this morning from a neighbor's place with an armful of roses the size of cabbages. ''Roses like these need pesticides, and I won't grow them because we're organic,'' she explains, filling a vase with tap water.</p>
        <p>The inspiration for their house itself jelled one day while the Mllers were reading Vogue and happened upon a story about a home designed by the architect Annabelle Selldorf. They contacted her cold to discuss the farm.</p>
        <p>''We started thinking about the house first with the kitchen,'' Mller recalls. ''How does the dining-room table become an extension of the kitchen?'' For the master chef, the kitchen needed to be designed so that people could visit him there but also so no one would get underfoot when he cooked. A part of the solution is keeping his stove near the refrigerator so that he could move between them with ease. ''There's nothing out of the ordinary here,'' he says. ''Nothing anyone can't have. We designed an entertainment kitchen. I knew we'd have a lot of dinners and parties and that I'd always be the one in the kitchen cooking. At mealtime, we put the hors d'oeuvres on the chopping block on the center island, with the silver and the plates stacked. Everyone gathers around the island for wine and to talk before we eat. We serve buffet style.''</p>
        <p>The kitchen plan is quite simple. No secrets here: gadgets are kept to a minimum. If there was a microwave oven, I missed it. There are two Asko dishwashers near the sink, a Garland oven and a Traulsen refrigerator. The electric coffee maker is made by Starbucks. ''Chefs hate cabinet doors,'' says Mller, who devised the idea of curtains over the cupboards instead. ''The idea was that I could pull a rope and everything would be at my disposal.'' Alas, the fabric doesn't curl as tidily as he would like. ''Something messed up in the translation,'' he admits, and laughs. ''We're debating with the architect. I want something different. She thinks it looks neat.''</p>
        <p>Like a debutante's ransom of Tiffany rubies, the tuna is very ''tartar'' now, ready for presentation and consumption. Mller chops some cilantro to doll up the dish. ''Cilantro is a bit overexposed, no? The cappuccino of the vegetable world.'' Dusting the fish with herbs, he pauses: ''Like everything in life, people tend to overdo. The idea of cooking is to help bring out flavor, not put it in your face. Food, like life, is all about balance. Acidity and sugar -- the savory with spice.''</p>
        <p>The following recipes are annotated by Eberhard Mller.</p>
        <p>Montauk Bluefin-Tuna Tartar With Fresh Herbs  ''This recipe is totally inspired by the freshness of the ingredients. The tuna has to be of the best sashimi quality, preferably from a belly cut where there is more fat. As for the herbs, I harvest them from our farm just before I start the preparation, and then I mince them with a very sharp knife so as not to bruise them.''</p>
        <p>3/4 pound sashimi-quality bluefin tuna, preferably from a belly cut which has more fat  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  1 teaspoon each, finely minced: chives, garlic chives, mint, cilantro and parsley  Salt and pepper to taste.  1 small lemon, juiced</p>
        <p>1/4 pound baby arugula.</p>
        <p>1. Dice the tuna into  1/8-inch pieces. Place in a mixing bowl and add the oil, herbs, salt and pepper. Sprinkle with 2/3 of the lemon juice and mix again. Check seasoning and adjust as necessary.</p>
        <p>2. In another mixing bowl, season the arugula with the remaining lemon juice and some salt and pepper. Place equal amounts of the arugula onto 4 cold plates and top each portion with the tuna tartar.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Marjoram-Scented Black Bass, Grilled Over Wood Fire  ''Grilling has become my favorite way to cook fish, especially when it's still whole. This way the meat is protected by the skin and bones, which allows for gentle cooking, even over low heat. Here, I use relatively strong flavorings and seasongs which, in combination with the mild wood smoke, produces a delicious result.''</p>
        <p>2 whole black bass, 3 to 4 pounds each, scaled and gutted  Kosher salt and ground white pepper  10 cloves garlic, peeled, crushed</p>
        <p>1/4 pound fresh marjoram  2 lemons, thinly sliced</p>
        <p>1/2 cup olive oil.</p>
        <p>1. Quickly rinse the two black bass under gently running cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season inside and out with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Fill the cavity of each fish with 2 1/2 cloves garlic, half of the marjoram and half the lemon slices. Drizzle half of the oil onto a very large platter, sprinkle each fish with salt and pepper and then with half of the remaining garlic, marjoram and lemon slices. Place both fish on top of the garnish, drizzle with the remaining oil and top with the remaining garlic, marjoram and lemon slices. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 to 4 hours.</p>
        <p>2. Brush a grill rack or grill basket generously with oil and place 5 inches away from medium coals on a charcoal or gas grill. Cook the fish for about 10 minutes on each side, depending on its size, until done. Remove from the grill to a large platter with the help of two large spatulas. Filet and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Slow-Roasted Heirloom Tomatoes With Fresh Thyme  ''Like any other tomato recipe, this dish lives or dies with the perfectly ripened tomato. Commercial growers breed for size, shape and hardiness of shipping, but you should put your emphasis on taste rather than appearance. I'm a willing taker for tomatoes that are not so stunning-looking because I know how good they taste.''</p>
        <p>6 medium heirloom perfectly ripened tomatoes, preferably a mix of red, yellow and green  2 cloves garlic, finely chopped  6 sprigs of thyme, leaves removed and finely chopped  Salt and freshly ground pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil  1 tablespoon sherry vinegar.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat your oven to 250 degrees. In a large saucepan of boiling water, blanch the tomatoes for 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon or strainer and immediately chill in a bowl of ice water or rinse under cold running water to stop the cooking. The skins will slip right off. Cut the tomatoes in half, crosswise. Gently squeeze each half to remove seeds.</p>
        <p>2. Oil a 12-by-8-inch or 14-inch oval baking dish and sprinkle with half of the garlic and thyme. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Now arrange the tomato halves, cut sides up, in the dish and baste with the remaining oil. Season generously with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the remaining garlic, thyme and vinegar.</p>
        <p>3. Bake the tomatoes for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. When done, they will be soft and just starting to caramelize but still hold their shape. Spoon the pan juices up over the tomatoes and serve from the baking dish.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Spicy Corn Stew  ''Given a choice, I always prefer white corn -- the sweetest and most tender you can find. Although new hybrids make corn on the cob much hardier and longer-lasting than it used to be, I am still from the out-of-the-fields-and-into-the-pot school of corn cooking. If you don't grow your own, try to find a farmer's market that sells fresh corn picked that morning.''</p>
        <p>5 to 8 ears of fresh corn  3 tablespoons butter  4 strips thickly sliced slab of bacon</p>
        <p>1/2 small onion, chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 cup dry white wine, preferably riesling  2 garlic cloves, crushed with the flat side of a knife and finely chopped  1 large jalapeno pepper, chopped  2 cups chicken broth  12 to 15 cherry tomatoes, quartered  1 tablespoon finely minced cilantro plus 4 nice sprigs  Juice of  1/2 lime  Salt and freshly ground pepper.</p>
        <p>1. Shuck the corn and cut the kernels off the cobs. Reserve the corncobs and kernels separately.</p>
        <p>2. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt 2 of the tablespoons of butter. Add the bacon and onion, cover and cook 3 to 5 minutes, until the onion is softened but not browned.</p>
        <p>3. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Add the garlic and jalapeno and boil until the wine is reduced to about 1 tablespoon. Add the chicken broth and corncobs. Simmer for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Add the corn kernels and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove and discard the corncobs and bacon.</p>
        <p>5. Swirl the remaining tablespoon of butter into the corn. Add the cherry tomatoes, minced cilantro and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with the sprigs of cilantro. Serve warm.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Lemon-Verbena-Peach-and-Raspberry Soup  ''Since we started our farm, I've rediscovered many vegetables and herbs that are not quite so mainstream. Lemon verbena is one of them. I'd often heard about it but never quite understood its fascination until we began growing it.''</p>
        <p>2 cups water</p>
        <p>3/4 cup sugar  4 ounces (3 bunches) fresh lemon-verbena leaves (about 4 cups or sprigs)</p>
        <p>1/2 cup lime juice  4 medium yellow peaches  1/3 pint raspberries.</p>
        <p>1. In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil and add the sugar. Boil 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, add all the lemon-verbena sprigs and submerge them completely in the sugar syrup. Cover and let cool down to room temperature. Add the lime juice and strain into a large bowl.</p>
        <p>2. In a saucepan of boiling water, heat the peaches for 30 seconds. Transfer to a bowl of ice water and remove the skins. Working with one peach at a time, hold the peach in your hand and make thin slices to the stone all around the fruit. Gently flick off the slices into the sugar syrup with the knife.</p>
        <p>3. Add the raspberries, cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.</p>
        <p>NOTE: Serve the soup just slightly chilled in order to best taste the flavors of the fruits and the lemon verbena.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
