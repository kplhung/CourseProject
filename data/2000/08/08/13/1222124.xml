        <p>IT didn't take long for DeLanee J. Collins to decide to sell her house in Tinton Falls through an Internet brokerage company rather than a traditional one. For the technologically savvy Ms. Collins the reason was simple: to save money.</p>
        <p>That was the promise of the company she used, Your Home Direct.com, based in West Long Branch. The company began operations in March under the premise that by linking the Internet with a range of real estate services it could make the process of buying and selling a home more efficient and less costly.</p>
        <p>Depending on the services provided through its licensed real estate agents under three different sales programs, Your Home Direct charges 2 to 3.9 percent of the sales price. This compares with the 6 percent commission that has become the industry standard for traditional brokerage companies. The Web addresses for Your Home Direct are www.yhd.com or yourhome direct.com.</p>
        <p>Ms. Collins listed her home with Your Home Direct after hearing its ad on the radio and calling for a demonstration. ''It seemed like a win-win situation,'' Ms. Collins said, without ''any greater risk than I would have with a traditional brokerage.'' Ms. Collins, 36, a single parent with two sons, is an international project manager at Avaya Communications in Holmdel, formerly Lucent Technologies</p>
        <p>Jason and Jennifer Walk bought Ms. Collins's contemporary with three bedrooms and a loft. ''I saw a virtual tour of the house and fell in love with it,'' Mr. Walk said. ''From my perspective I wasn't gaining or losing anything by buying this way.''</p>
        <p>There are a handful of traditional discount brokerages in New Jersey, including Lake Realty in Brick. Since the agency's founding in 1993, Sherif Selim, the owner, said he had been charging commissions ranging from 0.75 percent to 3.75 percent to sellers in Ocean and Monmouth Counties.</p>
        <p>But Your Home Direct bills itself as the first full-service licensed Internet-based company in the state.</p>
        <p>Internet real estate sites have been around for several years and have evolved from offering bare-bones property listings to providing lots of features, including data on neighborhoods as well as links to lenders and house inspectors. While such sites can save home buyers and sellers time by enabling them to narrow their search for houses and services online, many ultimately steered prospective buyers to traditional brokerage companies.</p>
        <p>With Your Home Direct, Glenn E. Cohen, a 38-year-old lawyer, has expanded the concept of e-brokerage by combining the Internet's time-saving features with flesh-and-blood brokers. Earlier, Mr. Cohen worked for his family's brokerage company in Shrewsbury, selling subdivision sites to developers.</p>
        <p>Initially backed by $2.8 million from investors, including the state's largest home builder, K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, Your Home Direct secured an additional $8 million in venture capital and established five offices in the state. It has 70 employees, 50 of them licensed agents. Since it started, the company has listed about 1,000 houses, mostly resales but a few new homes, Mr. Cohen said. Buyers have signed contracts on 275 and closed on 85, he said.</p>
        <p>The company says its fees are low because its overhead is low, its brokers spend far fewer hours than conventional brokers in showing property, and they work on a salaried rather than on a commission basis. They don't attend closings or home inspections, as many conventional brokers do, and in some cases they don't accompany the buyer on visits to the houses. In May the company added a mortgage subsidiary, yhd Capital.com.</p>
        <p>Conventional brokers questions whether services like Your Home Direct maintain large enough staffs of knowledgeable brokers to keep customers up-to-date about local market conditions. The suggestion is that a conventional broker might be able to get a better price for the seller.</p>
        <p>Your Home Direct replies that the time-saving feature of the Internet used in combination with real brokers serves customers well. ''Without the efficiency of the Internet we don't exist, and without the services we don't exist,'' Mr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>THE company joins a growing number of e-brokerage companies that have sprung up across the nation in the last two years as a ''bricks and clicks'' alternative to the conventional ''bricks and mortar'' way of buying and selling homes.</p>
        <p>Others include zipRealty.com in Berkeley, Calif.; eRealty.com in Houston; and Homebytes in Richmond, Va. Last month, Homebytes became the first e-brokerage company to be licensed in every state; it intends to be fully operational in New Jersey by the end of September.</p>
        <p>While some companies like Your Home Direct offer a range of fees based on the services the sellers want, others charge a set price. Homebytes, for instance, charges sellers a one-time fee of $499, which includes listing the home on the local Multiple Listing Service, the bible of available properties, and establishing a sales price. The company's agents also advise sellers on how to sell their houses via telephone and the Internet.</p>
        <p>Referring to discount e-brokerage companies generally, Dennis R. Cronk, the president of the National Association of Realtors in Washington, said: ''If they fit some consumers' needs, they will be utilized. But in the past discount brokerages have never reached any level of success in the business.''</p>
        <p>Walter Baczkowski Jr., the executive vice president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors in Edison, said that a ''good real estate market hides many evils.'' The test ''is how well these business models can withstand a bad economy,'' he said, adding that ''there is only so much venture capital to go around.'</p>
        <p>Under each of Your Home Direct's three sales programs it offers such basic services as listing the houses, with digital pictures and computerized tours on real estate Web sites, and marketing the houses through tradition print advertisements and ''for sale'' signs. The company prequalifies all prospective buyers and provides online links to a network of professionals.</p>
        <p>The lowest commission Your Home Direct charges in 2 percent. For that, sellers get the basic listing services but must show their homes themselves.</p>
        <p>For a 3 percent percent commission, an agent will provide the seller with a marketing plan and with help on setting a realistic price, will show the house and will handle all negotiations.</p>
        <p>For a 3.9 percent commission the company will also list the home with the local Multiple Listing Service. Under this plan if the house is sold through the buyer's broker, that broker gets 2.5 percent of the 3.9 percent commission; the Your Home Direct agent gets the remaining 1.3 percent.</p>
        <p>To sell her Tinton Falls house, Ms. Collins selected the 3 percent plan, and the house was shown to five prospective buyers, including the Walks. After negotiating to have some minor repairs done, the Walks offered to pay Ms. Collins's full asking price of $229,900. She, in turn, paid Your Home Direct a $6,897 commission, compared with the $13,794 she would have paid a broker charging the standard 6 percent. ''Along with the savings,'' Ms. Collins said, ''it was a relatively hassle-free experience.''</p>
        <p>A recent survey of 20,000 buyers conducted by the National Association of Realtors  showed that 37 percent of the home shoppers used the Internet as ''as search tool,'' up from 18 percent in 1997 and from 2 percent in 1995, said Mr. Gronk, the group's president. But he added that 49 percent of the respondents said they actually found their homes through a local Multiple Listing Service, compared with 4 percent who found their homes through the Internet.</p>
        <p>''The industry is changing, and Realtors have to prove they add value,'' Mr. Gronk said. ''But today and in the past, sellers have migrated to full-service real estate brokerages.'' If commissions ''are ridiculously low, they ultimately must ask, 'What am I getting and not getting,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>But Nick Karris, a real estate analyst for Gomez Advisors, an Internet research firm in Lincoln, Mass., said that e-brokerage companies are changing the way business is done.</p>
        <p>''These are not fly-by-night companies that just put up fancy Web sites,'' he said.  The consumer ''is no longer at the mercy'' of the traditional real estate agent or of the traditional 6 percent sales commission.</p>
        <p>Executives at many established real estate firms in New Jersey acknowledged that by challenging the conventional pricing of brokerage services, e-brokerage companies like Your Home Direct would appeal to some but certainly not all consumers.</p>
        <p>''There are certain things that can't be done unless Realtors rub elbows with buyers and sellers in the field,'' said Jack Waters, a regional vice president, in the Matawan office, of Weichert Realtors, one of the state's largest residential brokerage companies. ''That's where the business is done, not on a laptop.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Cohen said that Your Home Direct would not overtake traditional full-service real estate companies. ''But we will take a piece of the market,'' he said.</p>
