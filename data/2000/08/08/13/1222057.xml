        <p>FOR five weeks, through Sept. 14, Film Forum is showing some wonderful foreign classics made in the years 1945-65, everything from ''Children of Paradise'' and ''Open City'' to ''The Seventh Seal'' and ''Breathless.''

My own sense is that brilliant, powerful, formally innovative movies -- our future classics -- continue to be made at this moment, all over the planet. Cinema is not at all dead.

        <p>And, indeed, the notion of a golden age in any field must be viewed with suspicion, in part because it is so often used as an unfair reproach to the present. I can understand the impatience of younger film lovers as they roll their eyes at yet another paean to the good old days of the French New Wave, or one more elegy about the death of cinema and the irrelevance of contemporary film criticism. My own sense is that brilliant, powerful, formally innovative movies -- our future classics -- continue to be made at this moment, all over the planet. Cinema is not at all dead. What is dead, or at least diminished, is film culture, the whole support system of art houses, influential movie magazines, Olympian film critics, 16-millimeter series operating in church basements like revolutionary cells, all embracing the latest cinema while filling in the historical gaps.</p>
        <p>In short, what is gone is the excitement of an International movement, and with it, the buildup, the anticipation of new sensations from abroad. So I think it's valid to say that 1945-65 was a golden age for foreign films. It was a remarkable, probably unrepeatable moment, when masters from the silent era (like Luis Bunuel, Jean Renoir, Yasujiro Ozu, Kenji Mizoguchi, Marcel Carne) were still producing some of their greatest work, veterans entering middle age (Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa, Roberto Rossellini, Luchino Visconti, Ingmar Bergman, Vittorio De Sica, Michelangelo Antonioni) were reaching their peak and newcomers (Jean-Luc Godard, Francois Truffaut, Satyajit Ray, Andrzej Wajda, Jacques Demy) were stunning the world with their audacity and reinvention of film form.</p>
        <p>Why were these two postwar decades, specifically, such a good time for foreign film in America? One answer is the high quality of the films; another is the receptivity of American audiences.</p>
        <p>The immediate postwar period was one of worldwide unease: the fresh memories of unspeakable carnage; the returning soldiers' difficulties adjusting to civilian life; the bitterness toward those who had prospered; the situation of women who had acquired some independence in the wartime workforce and now were being coerced back into domestic roles; the refugees and ''stateless'' citizens waiting in displaced persons camps; the need to rebuild cities reduced to rubble.</p>
        <p>Italy and Japan led the way in making movies with a tragic sense of life. American audiences, for the moment non-complacent, were dazzled by the stark production values of Italian neo-realism, with its location shooting and (sometimes) non-professional actors, and began acquiring a taste for humanistic realism, poverty, black-and-white photography and unhappy endings. At home, American studios took note of the newly pessimistic mood by producing film noir -- largely a postwar genre made by European emigre directors.</p>
        <p>Of course, sex was also a major attraction of foreign films. Not only could foreign directors get away with more, not having to answer to the Hollywood production code; they also took for granted such facts of life as extramarital affairs, homosexuality, prostitution and so on. This gritty realism was all very titillating: adult movie houses marketed art films like Bergman's ''Monika'' as if they were soft-core pornography. In those years, America still looked to Europe for its sophistication, aesthetic and sexual.</p>
        <p>How to explain the sea change that has occurred since? With the triumph of popular culture over high culture, Americans, global exporters of the winner, pop culture, no longer feel the same longing for what the Old World knows.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, our movies have caught up sexually with the rest of the world, for better or worse.</p>
        <p>Another changing factor has been the role of film festivals. There were fewer in the postwar era, and the results counted more. A victory at Cannes or Venice created almost unbearable suspense about the winner's American release date.</p>
        <p>Compare with the present: if ''Rosetta'' or L'Humanite'' or ''Beau Travail,'' all recent festival award-winners from directors with promising track records, had been released around 1962, I am sure these stunning films would have been more talked about and successful at the box office. As it is, each came and went rather quietly.</p>
        <p>Let's face it: American audiences have become more resistant to reading subtitles, while American independents have learned from foreign film classics to make homegrown art movies. Hollywood has done a good job of capturing an increasing market share worldwide, stifling the local product and discouraging the distribution of foreign films stateside.</p>
        <p>It must also be admitted that European cinema has sharply declined since its postwar heyday -- maybe not as much in France, but certainly in Italy, Germany, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe. The fact that Americans seem to identify more with European than Asian or African cinema may explain why the largely Third World cinematic titans of our own era, like Abbas Kiarostami, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Wong Kar-wai and Ousmane Sembene, have failed to become household names on the order of Fellini, Truffaut or Fassbinder. Or maybe it's that the whole machinery of promoting film directors as auteurs, demigod celebrities, seems to have slipped into lower gear: even a hot European filmmaker like Lars von Trier can no longer command the name recognition of Ingmar Bergman. (Leaving aside the fact that he's not as good as Bergman.)</p>
        <p>The golden age of foreign film coincided, not surprisingly, with the zenith of the art house. Hollywood studios' stranglehold on big theater bookings had prompted small, independent theater owners to switch to a foreign product. Art houses grew nationally from 12 in 1945 to more than 550 in 1960.</p>
        <p>Every medium-sized city had one. New York boasted over a dozen first-run, single-film art houses, most memorably the Little Carnegie, the Fifth Avenue Cinema, the 68th Street Playhouse, the Plaza, the Fine Arts. As art movies became hip, so did their venues: with espresso machines and stools in the lobbies, they were the forerunners of coffee bars, great places to pick up (or imagine picking up) someone attractive. In retrospect, these art houses may have been as important for their urbane architecture and interior design as their promotion of cinema.</p>
        <p>Alongside these first-run theaters, somewhat rattier in appearance but equally important, were the repertory houses -- the Thalia, the New Yorker and the Bleecker Street Cinema in New York, the Brattle in Cambridge, the Telegraph in Berkeley. These were our film schools. You could catch up with double-bills of classics all summer long at the Thalia, or cut classes and watch two ''forgotten films'' at the New Yorker, shuttling the Upper West Side corridor between 89th and 95th Streets.</p>
        <p>When I was a teenager I was attracted to film (and jazz, for that matter) in part because there was only about 50 years of history to keep in one's head. I could sit through some of the duller silent classics mentioned in Arthur Knight's paperback history of movies, ''The Liveliest Art,'' knowing that such dues were finite. But cinema has now celebrated its 100th anniversary, and at 100 years the narrative of the canon begins to fragment. No longer do Pabst and Murnau seem to glide so effortlessly into Welles and Wyler.</p>
        <p>Or there are newer, more truncated canons: the young men in a college film course I teach are keenly aware of sci-fi pedigrees, from ''2001'' through ''Blade Runner'' to ''The Matrix,'' or of Quentin Tarantino's debt to John Woo and David Lynch, but they've never seen a Godard, much less heard about ''Wild Strawberries'' or ''Diary of a Country Priest.''</p>
        <p>Video rentals spelled the demise of the repertory houses. With everything on tape (or, it was assumed, soon to be), audiences no longer felt the urgency to catch something old because it might not show again. ''The Bicycle Thief'' and ''Ugetsu'' began to seem like passe monuments, Old Master paintings in museums one might revisit any time. A curious thing happened: the drive for novelty brought the peripheral genres, the larky impulse rentals, to the center, while marginalizing the classics. Visit a hip video store today and you will find film noir, Hong Kong action pictures and ''outlaw'' directors (like Samuel Fuller, Sam Peckinpah and Ed Wood) featured prominently, while the more unambiguously towering cinematic masterworks are either unavailable or shunted to a back-room side shelf.</p>
        <p>Film Forum's redoubtable programmer, Bruce Goldstein, who curated the current series with Michael Sayers, is on a mission to change all that. Interestingly, Mr. Goldstein himself did his part to nurture film noir, pre-code, sci-fi, and campy ''worst'' movies into commercially viable genres.</p>
        <p>It was partly, he explains, that one had to package something unusual to attract the press, which meant abandoning the tried-and-true repertory. ''But because we did all these weird series,'' he adds, ''we'd lost sight of the classics. It's time to get back to basics.'' You can't get any more basic than ''The Golden Age of the Foreign Film'': besides the aforementioned titles, its lineup includes such unassailable classics as ''Rashomon,''  ''Seven Samurai,''  ''L'Avventura,''  ''Contempt,''  ''La Dolce Vita,''  ''Tokyo Story,''  ''Rocco and his Brothers,''  ''Beauty and the Beast,''  ''Ashes and Diamonds,''  ''The 400 Blows,''  ''Los Olvidados,'  ''The Golden Coach'' and the Apu trilogy. One might quibble with the omission of Rohmer, Becker, Rivette, Resnais, the Russians and the British, but of course such a series has to be highly selective. And the list does include a number of crossover hits of debatable quality: the over-ripe ''Black Orpheus,'' the likable but cheesy ''Never on Sunday,'' the over-calculating ''Wages of Fear.'' Other art house favorites included in the list, like ''Woman in the Dunes'' or ''Repulsion,'' seem now more like clever tours de force rather than full-blown masterworks.</p>
        <p>AND there is no attempt to lure the jaded cineaste with obscure films like those that might turn up at the Museum of Modern Art. On the other hand, museums, which have been heroically shouldering the bulk of the movie classics repertory, can perhaps adopt a more scholarly stance. Film Forum (though technically also ''nonprofit'') is a self-sustaining movie theater and has to be cannier about pulling in an audience.</p>
        <p>Precisely the charm of this current series, then, is that it is so definitely meat and potatoes, with no surprises, no revisionist intents. Its very emphasis on foreign film's greatest hits helps to recapture more sharply the cultural moment. Some of the pairings are particularly deft: Truffaut's underrated ''Soft Skin'' with Claude Chabrol's nifty ''Bonnes Femmes.'' Mr. Goldstein, ever respectful of history, says, ''I see it almost as an homage to the Thalia and the New Yorker, and the kind of double bills they did.''</p>
        <p>One thing has gotten better from the golden age of repertory: print quality. In the 1945-65 era, film buffs took what they could get, often scratched or washed-out dupes of pirated prints in 16 millimeter. Today's audiences are more exacting on that score, in addition to which the copyright laws have changed, making respectable pirating more difficult. Meanwhile, a handful of influential programmers (most notably Mr. Goldstein) have been able to persuade studios to strike new 35-millimeter prints. Distributors like Kino International, Milestone Film and Video, Interama, Strand and Rialto Pictures have done their part by rereleasing theatrically a stream of classics, many of which are included in this series.</p>
        <p>A whole new generation raised on video will thus be able to see these magnificent films as they were intended, projected on a big, enveloping screen in crisp visual detail. Older viewers like myself can revisit their favorites, savoring the satisfaction of taste confirmed or the piquancy of disappointment. Either way, we may someday look back with gratitude at Film Forum's repertory operation as a golden age unto itself.</p>
