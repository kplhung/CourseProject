        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your description of the anti-Semitism Soviet Jews face in Germany (front page, Aug. 6) is not limited to Jews from the former Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Yet there are hopeful signs. The current exhibition at Buchenwald, for example, stresses that virulent anti-Semitism has been part of German society for more than a century, and that Buchenwald was located near Weimar, the seat of German culture, to emphasize that extermination of Jews, as well as other ''undesirables,'' was an essential feature of German tradition. The exhibition concludes that the murder of the Jews of Europe by the Nazis was the worst crime in human history.</p>

        <p>This is a dramatic rejection of  the former Communist East German use of Buchenwald to propagate the notion that German death camps were the product of Western capitalism.</p>
