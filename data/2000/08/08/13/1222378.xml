        <p>Gerald Wayne Renfrow thought the nightmare hit its climax 15 years ago on a gruesome day when -- he still barely believes it -- he and his neighbors watched the city police bomb and burn down his solid working-class neighborhood, killing 11 people in a confrontation that became a firestorm.</p>
        <p>''Now they're bombing us again,'' said Mr. Renfrow, more furious than sad as he girds against the city's latest attempt at what officials are calling closure for Osage Avenue.</p>
        <p>That is the decision last month to send buyout condemnation notices to the owners of 60 replacement houses the city built as compensation for the  victims of the police blunder in May 1985, when the city routed the MOVE group of armed radicals who had turned their house at 6221 Osage Avenue into a fortress.</p>
        <p>Hovering in a helicopter with the authority of City Hall, the police dropped explosives on the MOVE row house, setting a fire that consumed the block-and-a-half neighborhood in West Philadelphia. Six adults and five children died inside the MOVE quarters.</p>
        <p>There has been a scandalous epilogue to the disaster. The gleaming brick replacement houses for the 60 innocent homeowners on Osage Avenue and Pine Street turned out to have been built with construction flaws by a corrupt developer. The houses have cost the city a small fortune -- more than $570,000 for each row house, including an endless wave of faulty repairs. Support walls cracked for lack of basic expansion joints. Cheap plumbing and wiring failed. Roofs leaked.</p>
        <p>And now the city has suddenly discovered, after 13 years, that heating systems present ''imminent danger'' to residents through leaks of carbon monoxide.</p>
        <p>The new administration of Mayor John F. Street, trying to cut the city's losses, this month offered Mr. Renfrow and his neighbors a painful ultimatum with a Sept. 6 deadline: Each must either quickly accept a $150,000 buyout or the house will be condemned at market value for less than half that amount as the city plans to raze the neighborhood one more time.</p>
        <p>''Mistake had piled upon mistake across the years,'' said the city controller, Jonathan A. Saidel, who drew the line when he refused to pay a bill from city housing officials for another $9 million in proposed repairs on top of the $35 million total spent so far on the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''I went over to the site and couldn't believe what I saw,'' Mr. Saidel said of piles of fresh brick and window materials waiting for what has been a nonstop parade of repair workers. ''I wondered how city inspectors signed off on this project in the first place,'' the controller said, echoing the long-running complaint of the residents.</p>
        <p>The initial disaster occurred under Mayor W. Wilson Goode, with repairs going on through the incumbency of Mayor Edward G. Rendell. Mayor Street, who took office this year, is accused by residents of trying to wash his hands of the debacle at the expense of the victims.</p>
        <p>''Oh, our new mayor wants 'closure,' '' said Mr. Renfrow, the leader of the Osage/Pine Community Association, who has been trying to rally his neighbors. ''He wants a feather in his cap as the man who finally ended the MOVE saga because we stand as a reflection of the city's incompetence. So they want to eliminate us, to decimate us once more.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Renfrow spoke on the way  downtown to fight the ultimatum with a civil lawsuit. He and 26 other resisters obtained a temporary restraining order to back up their demand that the city do what it promised -- provide proper replacement housing in the same neighborhood the police devastated. The area has the charm and sociability that residents say they revere and find irreplaceable, particularly as they begin looking for comparable value in housing in other areas.</p>
        <p>''We're fighting,'' said Sandra Lee at 6254 Osage, one of those who watched the police attack. She looks back on the MOVE members as folly-ridden, but at least worth remembering for their resistance to City Hall.</p>
        <p>''We were the victims and now they're telling us we got to go,'' she said, angry at what she said were  ''scare tactics'' by the city. ''If the heating was dangerous, how come no one died across these years?''</p>
        <p>City officials say that was very likely because the windows were improperly installed, too, and were so leaky that deadly gases were able to vent through the cracks. Critics say this is precisely the Catch-22 mindset  that has guaranteed there can be no closure over the MOVE episode until the neighborhood is made whole.</p>
        <p>''If they're going to tear them down and sell the land to a developer, why not build the houses back up for us the right way?'' asked Ernestine Grice, a widow who has lived on Pine Street for 43 years, except for the 18 months when she awaited reconstruction of her destroyed home.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely nothing good has come of this,'' said City Solicitor Kenneth Trujillo, who is directing the proposed settlement. ''It's terrible. As a legal matter this administration could walk away from it, but as a moral matter we could not.'' He described the settlement as ''double fair value'' and the only way to end what evolved into a perpetual burden on taxpayers.</p>
        <p>Initially, many of the homeowners accepted the buyout ultimatum. But Mr. Renfrow said they did so under duress and the city had a far greater responsibility remaining.</p>
        <p>One of those who accepted, John DeVere, owns two houses on Pine Street and he considers the offer a windfall, since the resale possibilities had been nil for years. ''But I'm an exception to most of the other people,'' Mr. DeVere said, ''old people with bills and mortgages and nowhere to go.''</p>
        <p>Outside 6219 Osage, Lucretia Wilson told of the unbearable years when MOVE members right next door, protesting the conviction of nine members for the killing of a police officer, turned their house into a noisome clan commune crowded with scores of animals and raucous with amplified lectures through the night. The helicopter raid came after the police said they had tried to serve an arrest warrant on a MOVE member and met fierce resistance.</p>
        <p>''They rendered my house uninhabitable,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''But I was happy to come home to the new one,'' she said, describing the restored block filled with children.</p>
        <p>''But the city isn't working with us,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''They're giving us ultimatums. This situation is no different from the MOVE situation.''</p>
        <p>For what it is worth, Ms. Wilson has the sympathy of one of her former next-door pests, Ramona Africa, a member of the MOVE group, dispersed to other parts of the city.</p>
        <p>''I was in that house when they bombed it and I'm the only adult survivor, and the only one who went to prison,'' said Ms. Africa, who served seven years for rioting. ''What we can see is the city created a bad situation for itself that day. Bombing babies was wrong, and when the foundation is wrong nothing good can from it.''</p>
