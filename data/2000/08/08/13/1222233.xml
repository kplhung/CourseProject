        <p>The building, called Classic Residence by Hyatt, is on the Riverdale border, and overlooks the Palisades, said Steven J. Cohen, executive director of the project.</p>
        <p>It cost $70 million and received a $40,000-a-year tax abatement over the next decade from the Yonkers Industrial Development Agency, said Edward A. Sheeran, the agency's executive director. The complex will provide 110 jobs and $700,000 a year in property tax revenue, he said.</p>
