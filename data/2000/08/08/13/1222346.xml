        <p>THERE are now official surveys to confirm that tourists are taking over New York City.</p>
        <p>With a population approaching nine  million, the city played host to about four tourists per resident last year, according to federal surveys and tourist research announced by city officials last week. The figures pushed New York up into second place for tourist destinations in the United States, bested only by Orlando, Fla., home of Disney World.</p>
        <p>Most of New York City's 36.7 million visitors came from within the United States, but foreigners made up about 20 percent of the total. Britain, Canada, Germany, Japan and France had the honor of providing the largest numbers of New York City's 6.6 million international visitors.</p>
        <p>So how do they know where to go? What do they expect of the strange and fearsome New Yorker? What is considered surprising and noteworthy?</p>
        <p>The questions are all the more interesting because the answers, as found in excerpts from foreign guidebooks, reveal as much about the culture the travelers are coming from as the one they intend to gawk at.</p>
        <p>And they also demonstrate, as many New Yorkers can testify, that no one has warned tourists not to come to a dead stop on Times Square's sidewalks at rush hour.</p>
        <p>Andrea Kannapell</p>
        <p>Japan</p>
        <p>From ''Chikyu no Aruki-kata (How to Walk on Earth),'' Vol. 38: New York 2000-2001 edition, published by Diamond Big Co.</p>
        <p>AT THE MOVIES As the film starts, the audience gets absorbed immediately. Although you are not allowed to make noise in the cinema, some people shout and cry. Literally, it is breathless movie-watching. If you are watching action film, there will be a storm of applause and cheers at victorious scenes. This noise isn't unpleasant but heightens excitement.</p>
        <p>WHAT'S O.K. IN HARLEM There are frequent muggings and violence in back streets. It is said drug transactions take place in abandoned buildings, and drug addicts reportedly won't hesitate to kill others in order to get $50. . . . Is it meaningful to visit such areas for sightseeing? It is O.K. to go to church to listen to gospel or visit a jazz club, but you shouldn't go to observe poor people.</p>
        <p>China</p>
        <p>From ''CityPack -- New York,'' Chinese-language edition, published by Joint Publishing Ltd., Hong Kong, 1996.</p>
        <p>STREET MANNERS Don't talk to the crazy people on the street, even though they may seem fun to be with. . . . New York women are very straightforward and can adapt well on the streets. So if someone harasses you, be like New York ladies: speak your mind and tell the person to blow off.</p>
        <p>Germany</p>
        <p>From ''Marco Polo -- New York,'' published by Mairs Geographischer Verlag, 2000.</p>
        <p>RULES Do not go to the park alone at night. And never carry more than $50 in cash. Do not shop spontaneously. Shops on Fifth Avenue which advertise ''going out of business'' sales are rarely on the verge of actually closing. Do not eat from salad bars. . . . Do not count on seeing celebrities in restaurants which have photos of famous people on the wall. . . . Do not underestimate bicyclists. Always look right and left even before crossing a one-way street, as bike riders often speed in the opposite direction. Do not travel in ''gypsy cabs.'' New Yorkers do, but they also know how to negotiate the right prices.</p>
        <p>From ''Goldstadt Fuhrer -- New York,'' published by Goldstadtverlag, 1998.</p>
        <p>VALUABLES When in a hotel room, always put the chain on the door. Don't leave your key at reception. If a thief enters your room, act as if you are sleeping. Call for help only after he has left. . . . Don't let your bags be carried by the mostly young men at Penn or Grand Central Station as they will often disappear.</p>
        <p>THE COLOR OF MONEY Be careful! Paper money is easy to confuse. All bank notes are green and the same size. What makes them different is the former president who appears on the front.</p>
        <p>Czech Republic</p>
        <p>From ''Globetrotter Travel Guide -- New York,''  by Michael Leech, published by New Holland Publishers, Czech edition: 1999, Geodezie Brno.</p>
        <p>LOGIC DEFIED In theory, it should be easy to get in and out of the city. But the traffic becomes unbearable at times, resulting in traffic jams. Moreover, winter frosts sometimes eat through the asphalt, creating large and dangerous holes. In the spring, the yellow taxicabs race through those holes tilted to a side.</p>
        <p>CHINATOWN REALITY The streets are always full of people, everything is incredibly dirty, the facades scream with tasteless bright neons. Yes, on one hand this place does stink, but on the other hand it emanates spirituality. One thing is sure: it does not try to pretend anything.</p>
        <p>England</p>
        <p>From ''Manhattan,'' by Vanessa Letts, published by Cadogan.</p>
        <p>EAVESDROPPING Keep your ears pricked at all times and you will be as entertained as much by what you hear as by what you see. Behind the gruff exteriors, Manhattanites are a wistful, open-hearted lot, and, perhaps because over 40 per cent are immigrants, they have a knack of muscling newcomers into instant conversations which can culminate in lifelong friendships.</p>
        <p>DIALECT Bus drivers are a higher breed and will appreciate it if you thank them as you disembark (one is said to salute his passengers with ''Get'cher smile on, folks; nobody rides dis bus today widdout a smile'').</p>
        <p>From ''New York City: The Rough Guide,'' by Martin Dunford and Jack Holland.</p>
        <p>BOBBIES' COUSINS The New York City Police -- the N.Y.P.D., a k a ''New York's Finest'' -- are for the most part approachable, helpful and overworked. This means that asking directions gets a friendly response, reporting a theft a weary ''Whaddya want me to do about it'' -- and any smile is greatly appreciated.</p>
        <p>From ''New York City (Condensed),'' published by Lonely Planet.</p>
        <p>EXTREMES Dense, immense, intense -- there is no other place with as much upfront allure. The bagels have the most cream cheese, the panhandlers have the best stories, you can take your dog to church, you can pray to Mecca (or Wiccan) in the street, sell lobster bisque from a hot-dog stand and no one will bat an eyelid.</p>
        <p>France</p>
        <p>From ''Le Guide du Routard,'' published by Hachette, 2000/01.</p>
        <p>TAXI DRIVERS They are very nice and don't mind driving you only a few blocks! A dream for the Parisians, used to the arrogance of local drivers. Yet, their way of driving is harsh; they might slam on the brakes and suddenly speed up, insult other drivers. This is a part of the city's climate.</p>
        <p>HEDONISM Alcohol is still taboo in the U.S. American society, very puritan and conservative, allows the free sale of arms but has outrageous regulations for anything related to taboo pleasures (sex, marijuana, alcohol and even some rock CD's, considered too subversive). . . . You should never go out without your passport, as some bars may request it. They are crazy, these Americans.</p>
        <p>COFFEE If you want to avoid drinking what is called regular or American coffee, which tastes like dishwater, buy some Nescafe and add it in.</p>
        <p>CULINARY MATTERS To say that an average American has bad eating habits and eats too much is at the same time true and too easy. . . . Americans are rather partial to food. You will be struck by the number of overweight people.</p>
        <p>From ''U.S.A.: Est et Sud,'' Guides Bleus, published by Hachette Tourisme, 2000.</p>
        <p>MORE CULINARY MATTERS Please note the strange custom of the doggy-bag. It is common at restaurants to take away your leftovers; you get a bag for a dog filled with food even if you do not have a dog.</p>
        <p>From ''New-York,'' by Egle de Bure, published by Guide Marcus, 1997.</p>
        <p>AND MORE . . . We have often criticized New York cuisine for being mediocre. This is not true anymore as New York has become one of the world capitals of bonne cuisine. First, the service is great, you are treated well (except in the fashionable restaurants, but this is a part of the contract). . . .</p>
        <p>VOCABULARY Cockroach: famous New York bug that is found everywhere, even at very fancy places.</p>
        <p>Italy  From ''Guidebook for New York and Washington,'' published by Touring Club Italiano, 1999.</p>
        <p>STYLE IN MOTION Walking is important to New Yorkers. Numerous office workers, at exactly 5 o'clock, will walk out of their buildings, quickly taking off their dress shoes and putting on sneakers for their long treks to the subway or buses. Like in the Woody Allen movies (a New Yorker to the extreme), people are constantly walking, not just for exercise, but to relieve stress and to socialize. ''Will you come with me?'' is a common question that usually ends up in a 20-, 30- or 50-block walk.</p>
        <p>LYRICISM The truth is that it is New York,  not Washington, D.C., that is the capital of America. It is Gotham, not Hollywood, that is the factory of dreams. It is part of our collective imagination. . . .</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 20, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about advice to tourists misstated the population of New York City. It is estimated at 7.5 million, not approaching 9 million.</p>
