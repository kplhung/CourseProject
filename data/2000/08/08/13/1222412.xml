        <p>As President Clinton nears a decision on building a national missile defense, an intelligence report warned that the decision could prompt China to expand its nuclear arsenal tenfold, while Russia could take destabilizing steps like placing multiple warheads on its ballistic missiles.</p>
        <p>The report could erode support for the administration's proposed missile shield, which is also facing technological hurdles. Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen postponed making his recommendation to Mr. Clinton by at least a month, citing ''a number of difficult issues,'' including the need for more tests and delays in building a new booster rocket.</p>
