        <p>To some, it lent a touch of style. Others thought it looked like a flowerpot. For Georges Batrakani, the Greek Catholic French-speaking Syrian businessman in Robert Sole's wonderfully evocative novel BIRDS OF PASSAGE (Harvill, $26), manufacturing the tarboosh -- or fez, as it is better known here -- was a method of acquiring wealth in early 20th-century Cairo. Sole, a French journalist who was born in Cairo, follows four generations of the Batrakani family in Egypt, using their triumphs and tragedies to recreate a place and time long gone. Sole deftly weaves the family's history into a tapestry of a colorful and complicated era in Egypt, one marked by ethnic and religious diversity, world wars, occupying powers and, finally, the nationalism and independence that will lead to the tarboosh's demise there -- and to the departure of the Batrakanis and many other families. Told through the eyes of a grandson who makes good use of a relative's diary, the novel, ably translated from French by John Brownjohn, has characters as exotic as the setting. Among them are Georges himself, a Levantine who, in the eyes of a friend, ''hovered between two cultures, juggled with three languages and possessed no well-defined status of his own.'' Maggi, Georges's sister-in-law and occasional lover, is as sensuous as anyone in Lawrence Durrell's ''Alexandria Quartet.'' And Ferdinand, Georges's overweight brother, gives a memorable demonstration of the proper way to eat molokhiya, a garlic-flavored dark green soup. If this literary concoction is so rich that one occasionally loses track of the name of a sultan or a revolutionary, never mind. The dish is ravishing.</p>
