        <p>CHARLES DICKENS did not have Detroit in mind when he wrote, ''It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.'' But it sums up the situation for the nation's auto industry.</p>
        <p>With the American economy strong and unemployment at near-record lows, automakers are selling all manner of four-wheeled vehicles at a record pace. Profits are good. The companies are flush with cash. Labor disputes look remote.</p>
        <p>Yet Wall Street has looked at these fundamentals and effectively scoffed, ''Big deal.'' Auto stocks, which peaked during the spring, are down, in some cases substantially. The stock market, analysts say, is expecting a slide in demand -- though it may be many months away and may not come at all.</p>
        <p>''The good news is that sales have never been better,'' said Stephen Girsky, an auto industry analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''The bad news is that with slowing employment, rising interest rates and rising gasoline prices, sales are going to fall. And the pricing environment is just terrible.''</p>
        <p>At a seasonally adjusted annual rate of around 17 million vehicles, sales remain at record levels. But they were higher six months ago, and inventories are rising. All these factors have combined to send the stocks skidding.</p>
        <p>General Motors, which was trading in the low $90's in May, closed on Friday at $63.25. DaimlerChrysler, which peaked at just over $68 in early April, is now at $56.375. Ford Motor, which most analysts see as the best stock of the lot, has taken only a modest hit. Its shares, which peaked at just over $31 in mid-April, are now at $29.125.</p>
        <p>''In a rising interest rate environment and a moderating vehicle sales environment, these stocks tend to perform poorly,'' said Nicholas Lobaccaro, who follows auto companies for Lehman Brothers. ''And you are looking at much heavier supply of the most profitable vehicles and major inroads by foreign manufacturers in trucks and sport utility vehicles.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the long-term worry is that worldwide supply of vehicles is far outstripping demand. That is great news for consumers, because it suggests that prices will probably remain under pressure. But it is not positive for corporate profit margins.</p>
        <p>''We estimate there are 40 excess assembly plants around the world, which probably means the industry has 100,000 extra employees,'' said John A. Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>And more supply is coming. Japanese manufacturers, seeking bigger market share, are committed to bolstering production of light trucks and S.U.V.'s in the North American market, Mr. Casesa said.</p>
        <p>An increase in light-truck capacity, which some analysts estimated at 15 percent, would almost certainly threaten profits in the product line that has been Detroit's biggest money-maker.</p>
        <p>Some analysts, however, say the worst may be past for the stocks. They contend that that interest rates may have peaked, that the economy is slowing but is not likely to stall, and that gasoline prices are off their highs. And auto stocks are trading much lower than they were three months ago.</p>
        <p>David Bradley, an auto industry analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities, turned negative on the stocks in mid-May, when the economy was growing rapidly and the Federal Reserve seemed intent on raising interest rates for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>He has not changed his view entirely since then, but he says he is feeling a bit better. ''I have gone from being quite bearish to a slightly more positive posture,'' he said. ''We are advocating putting a toe in the water where we see opportunity.''</p>
        <p>But with the economic outlook still muddled, few analysts are sanguine about what will happen on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>''I think the stocks will be choppy for the rest of the year, but I think they are undervalued,'' said Wendy Beale Needham of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. She is recommending Ford and G.M. for purchase.</p>
        <p>Indeed, most analysts say Ford seems the best investment. ''We have been very cautious on DaimlerChrysler and General Motors, but think Ford can create shareholder value, mainly because of their product pipeline,'' said Mr. Lobaccaro at Lehman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley also likes Ford, but as a short-term play. This month, Ford shareholders approved a proposal to distribute a special $10 billion dividend. Ford, which has already distributed $5.7 billion to investors, could pay for the balance by buying back its stock, he said.</p>
        <p>''Even though the stock has popped in the last week or so, Ford clearly has short-term potential,'' he said. ''I think the buyback is worth another 5 percent on the stock.''</p>
        <p>MR. BRADLEY said investors with longer time horizons might consider G.M. -- not because of its prospects in the motor vehicles sector, but because it still owns 30 percent of Hughes Electronics. Chances are that the company will spin out that remaining portion or split it off in the second half of 2001, he said.  ''Another spin of Hughes could be worth $20 a share on General Motors stock,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Generally, analysts are less than positive about DaimlerChrysler, which they say has yet to realize the potential of its megamerger nearly two years ago. ''Clearly, the merger hasn't gone as well as Daimler would like,'' Mr. Girsky said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lobaccaro added: ''If you look at the current earnings growth rate of DaimlerChrysler, it is hard to reconcile how low it is, if all the synergies they claimed would be realized were actually hitting the bottom line. From a near-term and medium-term perspective, the merger has been a disappointment.''</p>
