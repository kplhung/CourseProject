        <p>HOME AND EXILE</p>
        <p>By Chinua Achebe.</p>
        <p>Oxford University, $18.95.</p>
        <p>An act of reading forms the center of ''Home and Exile,'' the poet and novelist Chinua Achebe's reflection on his and Africa's literary coming of age. As a young university student, Achebe encountered Joyce Cary's novel ''Mister Johnson,'' which is set in Achebe's native Nigeria. Cary wrote of the ''squalor'' and ''stinks'' of a continent inhabited by ''jealous savages,'' ''senseless and unhuman.'' Forced to reconcile the homeland he knew with the territory of the colonial imagination, Achebe ''began to understand. There is such a thing as absolute power over narrative''; stories were vulnerable to dispossession. As he quickly realized that to become a more conscious reader would be akin to criticizing such power -- and to take on the mantle of a writer would mean adopting that power for oneself -- Achebe's debut novel, ''Things Fall Apart'' (1958) was one of a handful of books that signaled the arrival of modern West African literature, of African citizens struggling to represent themselves in a literary as well as political sense as the era of imperialism drew to a close. ''Home and Exile'' is, fittingly, permeated by ideas of rebirth and return; it begins as the 5-year-old Achebe arrives for the first time at his ancestral home, and closes with the image of the Nigerian passport he received after spending the first part of his life as a British subject. After the trauma of becoming, in essence, an exile in his own land, Achebe celebrates this reclamation of one's home by offering his own Nigeria, in the form of memories, family anecdotes, parables of the Igbo people -- stories constituting a master narrative at once intimately embedded in the history and heritage of a continent and too intensely personal to be reduced for the sake of political stratagems.</p>
