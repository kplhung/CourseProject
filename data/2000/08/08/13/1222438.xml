        <p>Against the Giants last night, the Mets were forced to battle a lanky and persistent left-hander in Shawn Estes, a brisk wind, a 38-minute rain delay and, most of all, themselves.</p>
        <p>When left fielder Benny Agbayani caught a fourth-inning fly ball and thought there were three outs instead of two and gave the ball to a boy in the stands, it looked as if he might have also given the Giants the game, turning a 1-0 Mets lead into a 2-1 Giants edge.</p>
        <p>Runs were scarce. Estes and the Mets' starter, Mike Hampton, had made sure of that. And Agbayani, unwittingly, ensured that two Giants on base were able to score after he caught the ball, gave it away, suddenly realized his error and then ran back to retrieve it.</p>
        <p>The boy, identified as 7-year-old Jake Burns, gave it back.</p>
        <p>And the Mets, stunned, bounced back.</p>
        <p>Todd Zeile reminded everyone that the Mets are, indeed, a true team, 25 players capable of picking up one another. Zeile smacked a two-run double in the seventh inning that helped erase a horrific night for Agbayani as the Mets won, 3-2, before 50,064 at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>Seldom, at least in recent years, had any Mets fan seen such a bizarre scene: a player not simply losing count of the outs but gracefully offering a live ball as a souvenir to a fan. And then grounding out with two outs and the bases loaded in the fifth inning when he had a chance to atone.</p>
        <p>It did not matter, though, because Zeile's double off reliever Felix Rodriguez gave the Mets their ninth victory in their last 11 games, their 15th in their last 18 and their 19th in their last 25th.</p>
        <p>''I looked at the scoreboard and I guess I saw the strike count instead of the outs,'' Agbayani said. ''I just glanced at it. It could have cost us the game and that would have been especially tough for Mike Hampton, the way he pitched. My teammates kept telling me not to worry about it, that it was already done.''</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine told him the same, but added a little extra.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people have been in that situation,'' Valentine said. ''I've seen it before. I've seen it just like that. He just made one of those mistakes that could have cost us the game. I told him it wasn't the first time it's happened, but make sure it's the last time it happens to him.''</p>
        <p>Hampton pitched seven innings and allowed five hits and those two unearned runs. Turk Wendell pitched the eighth inning and Armando Benitez the ninth to record his 29th save.</p>
        <p>Estes allowed only four hits, but walked seven. He walked the pinch-hitter Bubba Trammell to lead off the seventh, and Trammell eventually scored on Zeile's hit. Edgardo Alfonzo, who was walked by Rodriguez, also scored. Zeile's dramatic two-out hit changed the course of the night for the Mets in general, and Agbayani in particular.</p>
        <p>''A lot of players have been in the position where they feel like they lost the game,'' Zeile said. ''I was glad we overcame it. Estes was real tough tonight and got out of a lot of jams. Then Rodriguez came in and he got behind me, 2-0, and then evened it at 2-2. We battled. And then he gave me a pitch that I could poke down the line.''</p>
        <p>Until that point, Agbayani's blunder was the focal point of the game.</p>
        <p>Before it, Hampton had pitched craftily in and around trouble through the first three innings, boldly throwing his hard stuff inside to right-handed hitters and more easily handcuffing left-handed swingers with similar power. He forced the Giants to leave men on first and second base in the first inning. In the second, he allowed a leadoff single to shortstop Rich Aurilia and, on an 0-2 pitch, hit first baseman J. T. Snow. But Hampton then gained a slick ground-ball double play when third baseman Joe McEwing fielded catcher Bobby Estalella's roller to third. McEwing gracefully stepped on third base for the forceout and then fired to first.</p>
        <p>In the third, Hampton allowed a leadoff single by center fielder Marvin Benard but benefited two batters later when catcher Todd Pratt threw out Benard as he tried to steal second base.</p>
        <p>But in the fourth inning, Hampton found that he could not overcome both Agbayani and the Giants. The inning began with a double by Jeff Kent followed by an error on Ellis Burks's ground ball. Kent moved to third base and Burks to second on Aurilia's ground out to third. Up stepped Snow.</p>
        <p>Hampton battled. If he could get Snow, his chance of getting the final out of the inning was good with Estalella. Even if Hampton walked Snow to load the bases, it would have been Estalella followed by pitcher Shawn Estes.</p>
        <p>Hampton battled, but hit Snow with a pitch, bringing up Estalella. He enticed Estalella to hit a fly deep to left that most likely would have scored one run on a sacrifice fly.</p>
        <p>But the Giants gained two.</p>
        <p>Agbayani caught the ball near the left-field line, strolled to the stands and handed the ball to a small boy wearing a black Mets T-shirt in the front row. It was a nice gesture. The only problem was, there was only one out. Kent scored. Burks scored. Agbayani took two or three steps in and then, realizing there had been only one out, retreated to get the ball back from the young fan. He did, but it was too late. The Giants led, 2-1.</p>
        <p>For the Mets, the inning ended with a real zinger when Hampton struck out Estes.</p>
        <p>That odd inning ruined the Mets' lead gained in the previous inning. Mike Bordick homered to left, a 371-foot line drive that was his third homer as a Met and his 19th of the season.</p>
