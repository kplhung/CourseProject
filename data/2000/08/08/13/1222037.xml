        <p>Edmond Keenan Wynn letter on Lisa Belkin's July 23 article holds truth is nobody, including parents, wants to live with children0</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Belkin's article about the ''childrunnn'' ends like this: ''And, in several decades, when the children are grown, we can all live side by side again, in child-free retirement homes.''</p>
        <p>Although meant as a humorous coda to the piece, it's quite telling: the truth is, nobody really wants to live with children, especially, it seems, parents. As soon as the term of incarceration as mommies and daddies is up, they move to gated, child-free communities, along with the rest of us.</p>
        <p>It is not parents versus nonparents; it's adults versus children. As soon as they can do so, grown-ups hie themselves off to adultville.</p>
