        <p>It's the 2000 X Games, in which some 450 athletes from 23 countries participate in such once-renegade ''extreme'' sports as dirt-bike jumping, aggressive in-line skating, street luge and sky-surfing.

        <p>SEE. See Lee. See Lee Dansie, a champion street luger with a Mick Jagger haircut, come streaking through the fog toward the Pacific Ocean on a flying bit of metal, shoes smoking.</p>
        <p>It's the 2000 X Games, in which some 450 athletes from 23 countries participate in such once-renegade ''extreme'' sports as dirt-bike jumping, aggressive in-line skating, street luge and sky-surfing. That last is the ultimate exercise in narcissism, in which a surf-rider and a camera flyer, sky-surfboards strapped to their feet and parachutes to their backs, jump simultaneously out of a plane at 13,000 feet, and fall for 9,000 feet or so,  spiraling, flipping and diving as they hurl merrily  toward earth at about 180 miles per hour, filming all the while.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, this city of extremes, both topographical and economic, has embraced the X games with messianic fervor. Last summer, the event drew over 270,000 spectators, not to mention over five million ESPN viewers, including 37 percent of all male teenagers in the United States, according to Nielsen analysis for the company. (The games will start on Thursday; delayed television coverage starts on ABC and ESPN this Saturday.)</p>
        <p>Josh Blackman, 5, standing bug-eyed on Friday as the lugers, bigger boys with iron abdominals, whizzed past him in a practice event, succinctly summed up the  appeal of the lugers: ''They turn and they wreck.''</p>
        <p>The games, now six years old -- an eternity in youth culture -- as well as the newer Gravity Games on NBC, are spawning extremes of their own. This fall, for instance, will see the debut of not one but two brands of extreme sports trading cards. The stunt biker Dave Mirra, the Michael Jordan of the dirt set, has his own chewing gum (Dave Mirra's BMX Bubble Gum), as well as his own pro model signature Adidas sneaker as well as a cereal en route.</p>
        <p>Numerous athletes, including the skateboarder Tony Hawk, ace executor of ''the 900'' (two and a half  turns in the air on a skateboard off a vertical ramp), have their own video games, and extreme action figures and finger-size street luges and dirt bikes are popping up at toy stores near you. (Mr. Dansie, soon to be an action figure, said he was looking forward to his check.)</p>
        <p>In perhaps the unkindest blow to the dwindling band of athletes who are corporation-shunning street-purists, a Barney-colored miniature ''vert ramp'' with skateboard now comes with every McDonald's Happy Meal.</p>
        <p>''It's just the way things work,'' said Chad Kagy, a 21-year-old stunt biker and bronze medalist from Gilroy, Calif., who may resemble Harry Potter on his Nimbus 2000 broomstick as he performs his favorite trick this week. Dubbed the Superman Seat Grab, the move has his feet soaring behind the bike while his left hand grabs the seat and his right hand spins the handlebars (got that?). ''One day you're riding with your friends,'' he said. ''The next day people want you to represent their bubble gum.''</p>
        <p>The extremely big business of extreme sports has been fueled not only by television but by extreme agents, who now represent approximately 20 percent of all athletes competing in the games.</p>
        <p>Extreme marketing is extending far beyond sports figures and products. In sportswear, ankle-high skateboarding shoes are replacing hightops, and cargo pants with extra pockets have become teenage uniforms. Adolescent males and those beyond can avail themselves of Right Guard Xtreme Deodorant.</p>
        <p>Steve Astephen, founder of The Familie, an alternative youth marketing agency that represents extreme athletes, says that the days of ''hey bro'' sponsorship were over, which he defined as an ex-rider coming up to  a rider and saying: ''Hey bro, what's going on? Wear our sticker and we'll give you a couple of bucks.'' Corporations, Mr. Astephen said, have woken up to the  fact that extreme athletes speak to the lucrative market of Y Generation (12- to 24-year-old) males and their $650 billion in annual spending power. The lure: individualistic sports that look cool and don't require a team.</p>
        <p>''These guys are tangible heroes,'' Mr. Astephen said of his stable. ''Tony Hawk tours local skate parks and skates with your son or daughter. When's the last time you saw Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan doing that?''</p>
        <p>Looking svelte for a 47-year-old in racing leathers, Steve Fernando, a Los Angeles firefighter who took up street luging after watching it on television, offered a contrasting theory.</p>
        <p>''So many people are having virtual thrills through computers and Playstations,'' he said. ''We're an adjunct on TV, seen through a point-of-view camera.''</p>
        <p>Mark Bryant, editor of Men's Journal, a bible of testosterone, notes that every generation has its instruments of rebellion, whether electric guitars or scooters whizzing up Eighth Avenue.</p>
        <p>Extreme sports, he said, ''reject the apparent dullness of modern life, at least as perceived by a 20-year-old.'' He sees them as an attempt to ''juice up life,'' to inject a note of edginess into a flush economy.</p>
        <p>''We're at the point where certain socioeconomic groups are thinking, if life is full of so many possibilities, why am I not having more fun?'' he said.</p>
        <p>The irony, of course, is that efforts to market the extreme naturally take the edge right out of it. Or, as Mr. Bryant put it, ''What could be more mundane than deodorant?''</p>
