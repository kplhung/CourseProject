        <p>First the magic, now the marketing. Harry Potter merchandise arrived this month in more than 140 Warner Bros. Studio Stores around the country. Warner Bros., which owns the rights to the first two Harry Potter books, is thus far selling relatively few items, among them T-shirts, backpacks and baseball caps. But the studio has made more than 40 licensing deals for Harry Potter products ranging from candy to soap, which will gradually appear before the first Harry Potter movie, scheduled to open Nov. 16, 2001.</p>
