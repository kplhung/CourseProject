        <p>The markets received a familiar configuration of economic data last week: a tame report on wholesale inflation that was coupled with a retail sales report showing that American consumers had returned to the profligate spending seen earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve will meet next on Aug. 22 to decide whether any further tweaking in interest rates is needed to fend off inflation. The board is widely expected to let the six tightenings of the last year continue working, and go no further for now.</p>
        <p>But the verve of recent consumer spending will keep investors alert this week to the July consumer price report - they'll be looking for any signs of resurgence in street-level prices. Among other reports due, business inventories, industrial production and another gauge of purchasing, the trade balance figures, will be examined for confirmation of any revival in consumer spending.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the Dow Jones index rallied as investors swapped out of technology shares and into old economy blue chips. The Dow ended up 260.05 points on the week, or 2.4 percent, at 11,027.80 points, finishing above the 11,000 mark for the first time in four months. The chastened Nasdaq closed the week up a shade, 2.11 points, to 3,789.47 points.</p>
