        <p>Vickie Johnson quickly patted Michael Jordan's shoulder as she left the MCI Center court, giddy from her brush with greatness. But tonight, Jordan, a part-owner of the Mystics, was a casual observer. Johnson was the one with the spellbinding touch.</p>
        <p>The Liberty's small forward did everything tonight against the Washington Mystics, from hitting the timely jump shots, to playing stingy defense, to breaking the press and exhorting her teammates to silence the thundering crowd of 16,331 fans with victory.</p>
        <p>Just when it seemed as if the Liberty would squander her effort, letting the Mystics come back from a 12-point first-half deficit, Liberty Coach Richie Adubato clamped a zone defense on Washington. Three whiplashed minutes later, the Liberty had escaped with a breathless 72-63 victory in the first round of the the Women's National Basketball Association's two-of-three Eastern Conference playoffs.</p>
        <p>''I was very surprised,'' Johnson said. ''I don't even know how much we won by.'' Her confusion was understandable. Everything happened so quickly.</p>
        <p>Johnson had scored 20 points, shooting 7 of 11 from the floor, and pulled down a team-high 8 rebounds, supplying the oxygen for the dizzying victory that gave the Liberty the first game. Game 2 shifts to Madison Square Garden on Monday.</p>
        <p>''Vickie was phenomenal,'' Adubato said. ''It seemed to me she was everywhere. A lot of time she doesn't get the credit she deserves, but Vickie Johnson is a complete basketball player.''</p>
        <p>Johnson guarded Chamique Holdsclaw, who scored 18 points in the Mystics' losing effort. ''I felt like this was our game to win,'' Holdsclaw said. ''We just made some stupid plays down the stretch. We couldn't make the plays when we needed to.''</p>
        <p>This was Holdsclaw's first playoff game in the W.N.B.A. While four Liberty starters had played in at least one of New York's three postseasons, the only Mystic with playoff experience was Vicky Bullett.</p>
        <p>And she showed it. Bullett, the two-time Olympian, sank a 3-pointer with 6 minutes 40 seconds remaining that tied the score at 51-51.</p>
        <p>''We were depressed that we let the lead go by,'' said Tari Phillips, the Liberty's All-Star forward, who equaled Johnson's total with 20 points. ''The crowd was crazy and we could have just said we messed up and give in to this loss. But we dug deep for this one.''</p>
        <p>After Bullett made her 3-pointer, Adubato changed defensive philosophies. Bullett was hitting deep, and Holdsclaw and her teammate Nikki McCray were killing the Liberty with one-on-one drives.</p>
        <p>''I knew we couldn't win like that,'' Adubato said. ''I had to put on the zone.''</p>
        <p>When that happened, Johnson found a flow to the game, and led the Liberty on its closing 14-5 run. ''I felt very comfortable because you could see in their face that they didn't know what was going on,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Johnson scored 9 straight points, willing the Liberty to stay in the game. When the Mystics tied the score, Phillips, the Liberty's leading scorer who was voted the league's most improved player this year, scored 5 straight points, bringing the lead to 58-55 with 4:22 to play.</p>
        <p>While the Mystics tied the score at 58-58, Tamika Whitmore muscled in a shot to make it 60-58 with 3:15 left. Johnson drove to the basket and drew two foul shots, making both, for a 62-58 lead which only grew as the seconds ticked off the clock.</p>
        <p>The Liberty went into the locker room at halftime with a 40-28 lead, but they had been in front by as much as 18 points. The Liberty burst into the game looking like a playoff-primed team, while the Mystics looked scared in their own arena, throwing up hard, off-balance shots. The Liberty players executed flawlessly, making 10 of their first 12 shots. The Liberty easily shook off the Mystics' press, and took advantage of Washington's early anxiety. That anxiety only increased with the defeat, and now the Mystics face elimination.</p>
        <p>''Now we come back to our house,'' Johnson said.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is to sweep,'' Phillips said. ''This is a team that can do that.''</p>
