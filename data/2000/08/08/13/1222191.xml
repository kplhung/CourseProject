        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It's not often that one can point to the exact moment that will determine one's musical tastes for a lifetime. I was a young child when Mr. Cliburn won the Tchaikovsky piano competition and it affected me deep  ly. A whole new world opened up. I thought the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto in B flat minor was the most beautiful piece of music I'd ever heard, and I begged my parents for a piano. I subsequently bought all of Mr. Cliburn's recordings and was further exposed to the great composers. I attended many of his concerts over the years and was always enthralled not only with his musicianship but with the warmth and humility he projected on stage. He is an American treasure in the world of classical music.</p>
