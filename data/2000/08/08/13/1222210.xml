        <p>Can art consist of two related photographs that together suggest, but do not tell, a story, or a compilation of photocopies that are developed partially by chance?</p>
        <p>Two New Jersey artists who are part of the ''2000 New Jersey Fine Arts Annual: Into the Millennium,'' on view at the Newark Museum through Sept. 17, think so.</p>
        <p>The mysterious photographs in which shadows take on the look of living creatures are produced by Mac Adams of Montclair, who was selected to exhibit work at the annual art show featuring New Jerseyans. A sculpture created by Mr. Adams, ''Bones,'' also is part of the exhibition. Frank Bosco of Millburn will show his works created from assemblages of photocopies.</p>
        <p>Also in the exhibition are graphite drawings of landscapes and locomotives by Peter Cross, who bases his work on the scenes in the abandoned industrial waterfront area of his hometown of Jersey City.</p>
        <p>The works of those three and other artists who live or work in New Jersey are part of the annual exhibition, which was selected by Fred Wilson, a conceptual artist who recently received a MacArthur Foundation award and Joseph Jacobs, the museum's curator of American art.</p>
