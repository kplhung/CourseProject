        <p>Katharine Geddes Weiser, the daughter of Antoinette G. Weiser and the Rev. Ivan Weiser of Santa Fe, N.M., was married yesterday to James Todd Macdonell, a son of Donna L. Macdonell and Dr. Joseph K. Macdonell of Salmon Arm, British Columbia. The bride's father performed the ceremony at St. Thomas Episcopal Church on Fifth Avenue in New York, from which he retired as an honorary assistant minister.</p>
        <p>The bride, 27, is the director of admission, development and alumni affairs at the St. Thomas Church Choir School in New York, the church's boarding school for boys. She graduated from Kenyon College. Her father now works in Santa Fe with the Episcopal Diocese of the Rio Grande. Her mother, who is retired, was a special education teacher at Public School 145 in New York. The bride is a descendant of William Brewster, who was a leader of the Plymouth Bay Colony.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 28, is a consulting geologist in the New York office of Professional Service Industries, an engineering, construction and environmental consulting firm. He graduated from the University of Alberta in Canada. His mother is a radiological technician and his father is a staff radiologist, both at Cariboo Memorial Hospital in Williams Lake, British Columbia.</p>
        <p>The bride and bridegroom met in 1997 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, through a mutual friend. Miss Weiser was teaching English as a second language at a school there, and Mr. Macdonell, who was living in Asmara, Eritrea, was visiting the local office of a mineral exploration company for which he worked. They were drawn to each another immediately.</p>
        <p>''He's just a really great guy -- really nice, good values, honest, fun-loving,'' Miss Weiser said.</p>
        <p>''I thought she was very pretty and very smart and witty,'' he said. ''But she was involved with someone else at the time, so I respectfully kept my distance.''</p>
        <p>Later that year, as the political situation in Ethiopia worsened, Miss Weiser moved back to New York, and Mr. Macdonell took an assignment in French Guiana. Around Christmastime, as he and the friend who had introduced them pondered where they should spend a few days of their vacation, Mr. Macdonell thought of going to see Miss Weiser in New York.</p>
        <p>She agreed to be their travel guide. And one day, during a walk through Central Park, Mr. Macdonell and Ms. Weiser suddenly started focusing on each another.</p>
        <p>''We knew this would be something really special if we allowed it to happen,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A few months later, he took a new job and moved to New York. Last March, he proposed marriage.</p>
        <p>''We literally met on the other side of the world and were lucky enough to cross paths again,'' the bridegroom said.</p>
