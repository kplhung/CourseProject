        <p>There is a building in central Queens that is a temple to the working man. It is a fading neo-classical castle of brick and plaster. It is five stories high and one floor down, and the American flag that flies above it is the only American flag that can be seen clearly on Queens Boulevard for a mile in either direction.</p>
        <p>It is Lodge No. 878 of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. To be a member you must be a United States citizen and a man over the age of 21 who believes in God. The cornerstone was laid in 1923 and the place was built for $750,000, an astronomical amount at the time. There is a hollow bronze elk on a pedestal in front of the entrance.</p>

        <p>There is a building in central Queens that is a temple to the working man. It is a fading neo-classical castle of brick and plaster. It is five stories high and one floor down, and the American flag that flies above it is the only American flag that can be seen clearly on Queens Boulevard for a mile in either direction.</p>
        <p>It is Lodge No. 878 of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. To be a member you must be a United States citizen and a man over the age of 21 who believes in God. The cornerstone was laid in 1923 and the place was built for $750,000, an astronomical amount at the time. There is a hollow bronze elk on a pedestal in front of the entrance.</p>
        <p>The place is dying from the inside out.</p>
        <p>The interior has those old municipal smells, like those in the public library or the marriage license bureau. There is no sign of life. A ringing telephone goes unanswered. There is a sign near the stairs prohibiting women and non-Elks from climbing further. On the mezzanine is a sturdy oak door, where an East Indian woman answers the knock. She is a secretary for the New Life Fellowship Church. ''God willing, we will own this place soon,'' she said.</p>
        <p>At the end of the week, the Elks Club comes to life. A big screen carries a simulcast from the Belmont Park, and a dozen men hang around the first-floor bar waiting for their horses to come in. Most of them are the older crowd: white, retired teamsters, construction workers and such. They say things like, ''It's been a while since I been in this jurnt'' and ''Lemme get a sodie pop'' and ''Don't be a wise guy, Sammy.''</p>
        <p>As it is at most men's clubs across the country, the sun is setting on Lodge 878. The building is for sale because the club can't make the $60,000 tax bill. The New Life Fellowship Church, which has been renting the mezzanine for four years, plans to purchase the lodge by the end of December for around $10 million. One of the sticking points in the deal is that the Elks would like to retain control of the first floor -- rent free -- for 99 years.</p>
        <p>''The whole world's changed,'' said Patrick Pendergrass, 66, the treasurer of the club and the man who phones the bets to the Off-Track Betting office. ''Clubs like this are folding all over the place. It's a piece of America that's dying. We'd like to stay here.''</p>
        <p>Once, everybody who was somebody and everybody who wanted to be somebody belonged to the club. There were congressmen, district attorneys, local political bosses. The club once had 6,600 members (now there are about 600). If you wanted a job in 1960's Queens, you came to the Elks. There was the Elks Bazaar, the borough's social event of the year. There was the raffle of two dozen Cadillacs. There were the eight bowling alleys -- with automatic pin setters -- in the basement. There were the three bars. There were the drinks and dancing and deals made under the stained-glass skylight. There was the charitable work.</p>
        <p>Now there are Fridays and the 20 rundown men who board in the rooms on the top floor. They wear robes and spend the day watching television.</p>
        <p>Here's what you're likely to hear at the bar on a Friday afternoon: Maybe things are better for the working man, maybe they're not; it's just that they don't seem better. The wife has to work now, no more coming home for your dinner and then off to the club. The neighborhood has changed. The houses are overflowing with third-world immigrants. The club is dying. They say the economy is better. They say the Wall Street money is finally trickling down, that wages are trickling up. But so is inflation. So are taxes.</p>
        <p>''It's not my America anymore,'' said Charlie Novak, 58, a construction worker and a veteran. ''The American kids aren't interested in community anymore. And then again the community is third world.''</p>
        <p>The statistics agree with Mr. Novak. Fraternal organizations are drying up all around the country. Since the end of the Vietnam War the Elks' national membership has dropped more than 15 percent, despite opening the club to women five years ago. The Shriners have shrunk from a million members to half a million since 1980. It's a similar story for the Knights of Columbus, Moose and Masons.</p>
        <p>Locally, according to the city's Department of Planning, the population in Elmhurst grew by 16 percent between 1980 and 1990. Public assistance increased by 91 percent between 1990 and 1995. While the number of people living there has increased, the number of whites was 20 percent in 1990, down from 36 percent 10 years earlier. At the same time, Asians have increased to 37 percent of the population, up from 29 percent.</p>
        <p>''Funny thing is,'' said Mr. Pendergrass, ''we keep afloat by catering to the third-world clientele. We do a lot of birthday parties and weddings here.''</p>
        <p>The older guys who live upstairs wander the halls behind clouds of cigarette smoke, staring blankly, appearing somewhat confused at this new crowd.</p>
        <p>''They're from another era,'' said Eddie DeJesus Jr., the administrator of the church. ''It's odd isn't it? A church and a fraternal men's organization below. It's so New York. Jesus said love everybody.''</p>
