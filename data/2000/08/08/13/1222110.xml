        <p>ROSEMARY JAMISON, a Texan who came to New York in the 1960's in search of a bigger canvas for her art, opened a restaurant here and has been filling it ever since with things like fake shark heads and black lights, bird cages and oil paintings, Life Magazines, pool ladders, armless mannequins and oddities of all sorts.</p>

        <p>ROSEMARY JAMISON, a Texan who came to New York in the 1960's in search of a bigger canvas for her art, opened a restaurant here and has been filling it ever since with things like fake shark heads and black lights, bird cages and oil paintings, Life Magazines, pool ladders, armless mannequins and oddities of all sorts.</p>
        <p>And, oh yes, she serves tacos, too.</p>
        <p>Walking into Rosemary's Texas Taco on Route 22 at Haviland Hollow Road is a little like falling through Alice's rabbit hole: it's dark, it's crowded with non sequiturs, and it feels like a flashback.</p>
        <p>''Oh, I studied art in college,'' said Ms. Jamison, 58, her drawl still evident. ''But it was like making a little charcoal sketch of a cow skull for days, and I want big.''</p>
        <p>For about 22 years this restaurant has been Ms. Jamison's art project, first love and home (for nine years she had another spot farther up the road). With Route 22 poised for more development, however, the restaurant building and the land is for sale. The landlord, Janet Hansen, said she wanted to sell now while the economy was good.</p>
        <p>''It's a great spot,'' Ms. Hansen said. ''Rosemary has been doing very well here, and she doesn't want to leave.</p>
        <p>''I feel heartbroken. I wish she could afford to buy the property herself, but she can't.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jamison, who swore off marriage as a girl and calls her art and her waitresses her babies, said the asking price for the property was $324,000, and that it was just too high for her.</p>
        <p>''I don't make any money here,'' she said. ''This is a labor of love.''</p>
        <p>If that is the case, then love must be pink and aquamarine with a hearty dose of glitter.</p>
        <p>Everything Ms. Jamison touches she turns to art. Her sidewalk is more Peter Max than Putnam County. Her vehicles are decorative first, functional second.</p>
        <p>Her 1961 Chevrolet Apache pick-up truck, no longer used, is intricately outfitted with beads, dolls and various knickknacks.</p>
        <p>Her converted small school bus, which she drives to haul her finds back from the Patterson flea market each weekend (''I'm always the first one there''), is also a mass of color.</p>
        <p>Her backyard is faux beach club. ''It's like you're in the bottom of a pool,'' she said. ''I want people to feel cool and refreshed.''</p>
        <p>Her bathroom: ''Pretend you fell into an aquarium.''</p>
        <p>But no canvas is more artfully crafted than the 4-foot-11 Ms. Jamison herself.</p>
        <p>Twice a week, she colors her hair purple, using a mix of ''trench mouth medicine and manic panic'' hair dye ''to give it more of a violet touch than pure purple,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She bats her three-inch-long eyelashes knowingly, revealing an arc of black eyeshadow, while she talks about her dreams of franchising Rosemary's Texas Taco.</p>
        <p>''Don't you think there's room for some competition to Taco Bell?'' she asked hopefully, while acknowledging that it might be difficult to duplicate the charms of Rosemary's.</p>
        <p>Then she disclosed her true secret hope for the future of her restaurant.</p>
        <p>''Maybe nobody will buy it, and I can stay,'' she whispered.</p>
