        <p>LOCAL bands that make a living on the Jersey Shore do not live the glamorous lives of Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi. But thanks to Scott Stamper, co-owner of the rock nightclub, The Saint, there will be at least one night where they feel like superstars. At the Eighth Annual Asbury Music Awards.</p>
        <p>Since 1993, the Asbury Music Awards -- which began as the Golden T-Bird Awards -- has had five homes over its eight-year run. This year, on Wednesday, it returns to the Stone Pony.</p>
        <p>''These awards are a way to give something back to all those hard-working local musicians who give so much to the whole Jersey Shore scene,'' Mr. Stamper said.</p>
        <p>Domenic Santana, owner of The Hard Rock Cafe in Jersey City, bought the Stone Pony, and reopened it last Memorial Day.</p>
        <p>''To a Cuban immigrant like me,'' Mr. Santana said, ''to own part of American rock 'n' roll history is a big high. The Jersey Shore sound, with its horns and hard-guitar rock, is the epitome of the New Jersey sound. This is the best place to hold an awards show that pays tribute to these bands that work so hard.''</p>
        <p>The nominees are bands relatively unknown outside the region: Mojo Love Dog, Makers of Fine Clocks, One Cool Guy and the Jazzlamic Jihad.</p>
        <p>There are 28 categories with nine nominees each, plus a Living Legend Award. The nominations are culled from ballots filled out by local club bookers and staff, and journalists.</p>
        <p>The categories include individual vocalists and instrumentalists, rock, pop, funk, roots, punk, ska and hard rock bands, radio stations and even avant garde performers. Top Blues Band and Top Indie Band are two new categories this year, thanks to the national attention local bands like Samhill and Borialis are attracting. Both bands are performing at the awards show, along with Last Perfect Thing, Virginia, Terraplane Blues, Brown, Dodgeball, Backhand, Liftoff, Latshaw and Blowup.</p>
        <p>The category to watch is Top Live Performance, which is really what the awards are all about. The nominees are Mudbox, Kid With Man Head, Dragpipe, Mad Daddies, E-Town Concrete, Dim Mak, Catch 22, Brown and Borialis.</p>
        <p>Fans can vote for the Saint Listeners' Choice Award on the Internet at www.superpunk.com.</p>
