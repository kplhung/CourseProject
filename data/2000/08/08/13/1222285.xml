        <p>THE last time I drove a Mercedes-Benz SLK, I couldn't lower the retractable hardtop. Not because it didn't work; it was buried under a half-foot pile of snow.</p>
        <p>That was during a dreary Michigan winter. This time, with temperatures temporarily near 90 under a broiling sun, the roof came down once and stayed there. The car was sunnier, too: It was a new-for-2001 model, the SLK320, with a 215-horsepower V-6 stuffed in the engine compartment.</p>

        <p>THE last time I drove a Mercedes-Benz SLK, I couldn't lower the retractable hardtop. Not because it didn't work; it was buried under a half-foot pile of snow.</p>
        <p>That was during a dreary Michigan winter. This time, with temperatures temporarily near 90 under a broiling sun, the roof came down once and stayed there. The car was sunnier, too: It was a new-for-2001 model, the SLK320, with a 215-horsepower V-6 stuffed in the engine compartment.</p>
        <p>The original version, the SLK230 Kompressor that arrived in January 1997, was a sales success. Mercedes had to double production to meet American demand. That car, like the new 320, had a sexy wedge shape and the retractable roof, a marvel of engineering capable of stopping traffic when it went up or down, the various panels whirring open as the roof lifted, folded and dropped out of sight -- all at the touch of one button in about half a minute.</p>
        <p>But the SLK230 had one nagging inadequacy: It didn't feel very sporty. Even with its supercharger, the four-cylinder engine was barely adequate for such a solid, heavy car. Sports car purists also lamented the lack of a manual transmission.</p>
        <p>The four-cylinder SLK230 is still around -- its horsepower rating inched up 5 for 2001, to 190 -- but most American drivers will find the new 320 more to their liking. This car has a version of the 3.2-liter V-6 engine used in several Mercedes products. The V-6 has peak torque of 229 foot-pounds, compared with 200 for the old car.</p>
        <p>The performance difference is impressive. While the larger engine supposedly shaves only half a second from the SLK's 0-to-60 acceleration time, to about 6.6 seconds, stoplight getaways feel far more exhilarating. And the SLK320 makes a throaty growl as the engine revs.</p>
        <p>Both SLK models are now available with a six-speed manual transmission, although a five-speed automatic continues to be offered. The six-speed is a big improvement over the notchy five-speed manual that was added to the 230 Kompressor last year, but its shift action is more mushy than crisp, and it sometimes balked at sliding smoothly into gear.</p>
        <p>While the V-6 and six-speed transform the SLK into a sporty package that can be driven hard, the car still rides more comfortably than most imported roadsters. (A sport package with a tighter suspension is optional.) With the top down, the solid Mercedes structure virtually eliminates body shake, and with it up, the car feels as well-braced and weatherproof as a coupe. This is one convertible that truly can be used year-round in the North.</p>
        <p>My only other complaint with the SLK320 was with its steering, which required extra effort to keep the car headed straight under hard acceleration.</p>
        <p>The body shape is the same, reminiscent of Mercedes roadsters of the 50's, but the front and rear have been updated subtly. Taillamps have clear covers; turn indicators are incorporated into the side mirrors.</p>
        <p>Inside, the SLK still has retro gauges (attractive, but not always perfectly legible), but the fake carbon-fiber trim of the original car is gone. The V-6 car has wood inserts; the four-cylinder version uses brushed aluminum. Both models have Tele Aid, an emergency communications system like General Motors' OnStar, and antiskid controls.</p>
        <p>To make room for the new car, Mercedes lowered the price of the SLK230 Kompressor by about $2,000, to $39,545 including shipping charges. The SLK320 starts at $44,545, but options can quickly add $10,000 or more.</p>
        <p>I was always a fan of the SLK, which has sold especially well among women. Its classy style cost half as much as Mercedes's top-of-the-line SL-Series roadsters. It rode more comfortably than the Porsche Boxster or BMW Z3, and its solid top made it usable year-round. The zippy new powertrain makes it sporty as well as stylish.</p>
        <p>INSIDE TRACK: SLK is short for ''slick.''</p>
